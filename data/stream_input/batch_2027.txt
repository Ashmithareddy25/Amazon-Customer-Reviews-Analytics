Some of the ideas were similar to thoughts I had had about another dimension.  It's probably not a book I would discuss with anyone other than my family, but I'm glad I found it.

B000W4E3OS|5.0|I have fairly rare (and expensive) CD with 39 of Scriabin's piano works on it performed by seminal Russian pianists such as Heinrich Neuhaus, a set that includes 8 pieces performed by Scriabin himself. This is about as close to a gold standard for this music that you're going to get. This set of recordings is a fraction of the cost of that single CD but Maria Lettberg's renderings of the pieces are comparable with those of her great predecessors. She's not only a competent pianist but also someone who quite obviously knows and loves these works.<br /><br />This is a great set of recordings for someone who's interested in this composer, especially if they want to try and play some of the pieces. Scriabin isn't the most accessible of composers, his printed music can vary from the deceptively trivial to the utterly incomprehensible, so its essential to have recordings to hand to give you some idea of the shape and texture of the pieces. You will have differences of opinion about the interpretation -- there never seems to be any 'right' way to play this material -- so don't be surprised if someone says \\"but so-and-so's recording of such-and-such is much better\\", it may very well be so. Individual results may vary but if its the body of work you're after this set of recordings is the way to go.
B005LAII80|3.0|*** spoiler alert ****<br /><br />As a fan of both comic books and dystopian futuristic movies, I really wanted to like this movie.  But there were too many nagging plot holes, inconsistent acting performances, and general over-use of slo-mo sequences, for me to completely enjoy it.  While a 1000% improvement over the Stallone version of this film from 1995, it is not a \\"must own\\".  I rented this movie on 2D Blu-Ray, so I can't comment on the 3D experience or special features discs.<br /><br />First off, while I am a comic book fan, I have only read a few that featured Judge Dredd- specifically the mid-1990s \\"Dredd by Simon Bisley\\" trade paperback and Batman-Dredd crossover.  Perhaps this doesn't qualify me as knowledgeable about the Dredd universe, but I've read plenty of comics, and seen movies like Robocop and Blade Runner, to know when this genre is working well.<br /><br />Here are the things I liked:<br />* Karl Urban as Judge Dredd.  He projects a gruff voice well and chews up the scenery whenever he is on screen.  It is a nice touch that he never removes his helmet, a faithful adaption of his comic book character.<br />* The authentic look of Mega City One and the Peach Trees 200 story slum tower.  Filming in South Africa helped give it a more different look, as opposed to filming with the LA or NYC skyline in the background.<br />* The compact and self-contained story.  Too many times in bad futuristic movies they overreach, showing off huge sets while having the protagonist try to save the entire planet.  The movie doesn't require you to have read 100s of pages of the comic to follow the story either.<br /><br />Here are the things I didn't like:<br />* Lena Headey as the villain Ma-Ma.  Fans of the Game of Thrones series on HBO will be disappointed, as Lena underwhelms as the evil druglord Ma-Ma.  They scar her up to make her look fierce, but she has few chances to show how evil she really is.  Maybe they cut scenes to keep the running time less than twohours.  Ma-Ma has few chances to be evil, even though other characters keep telling us how evil she is.  We just have to take their word for it.<br />* Kay, Ma-Ma's clansman.  He does little for much of the film, standing in the background as a cuffed prisoner of Dredd and Anderson.  He acts like he's on Law & Order- waiting to call his attorney, post bail, and sue the police if they attempt to abuse him.  That's not the world of Dredd!  Kay is guilty of so many crimes his punishment of death is a foregone conclusion, the judges tell him is only alive so he can be tortured at headquarters.  Yet he doesn't complain, threaten or bargain with his captors, or try to escape until what seems like forever.<br />* The Peach Trees lockdown plot device.  I realize that the 200 story high-rise slum is supposed to be a place where Judges fear to tread.  And that Ma-Ma's goons called Control and told them that they were running a system test.  But it seemed hard to believe that the building could remain completely sealed for hours, without attracting much suspicion from the Judges.  Especially so after Anderson calls for the meat wagon just before the lockdown, and Dredd radios in for backup after they briefly escape through the blown out wall.  I found it hard to believe that the judges would extend the benefit of the doubt for so long in a place that was described as a haven of crime and drug trafficking.<br />* Overuse of slow motion sequences.  There seemed to be lots of these in the film, and not just when one of characters was on the slo-mo drug.  The scene where Ma-Ma falls to her death has less impact since the effect had been used many times before already.<br /><br />All in all, I found the movie to be decent, but not excellent.  That's too bad, since the film had many things going for it that would have put it into the \\"most own\\" category.  Instead, it is in more in the \\"OK to watch on a airplane or road trip\\" category.<br /><br />3/5

0060516402|5.0|We sometimes wonder what makes a company great. We often look at its real and perceived competitive advantages, ideas like a strong brand, an extremely talented and visionary leader, cult followers, great idea or innovative product. We often tend to believe a company should posses these characteristics in order to be successful. I have even witnessed many people refusing to start a company before having the \\"aha\\" moment or the brilliant idea which will change the world.<br /><br />Mr. Collins and Mr. Porras researched many companies and identified several characteristics which identify companies which are built to last a long time. The book is written in a way of discussion on concepts and characteristics which distinguish these visionary companies from the rest of the companies. By highlighting these concepts the authors provide surprising facts and insights and breaking several myths about the reasons for a company long term success.<br /><br />The authors took a very interesting approach of comparing a visionary (build to last) company to a comparison company. As you read the book it seems as if the \\"comparison\\" company should be the one to last. However, after the authors provide the different approaches, characteristics and choices made by the two companies, we, the readers, are slowly coming to the realization it is the visionary companies which lasted. It is often the case the comparison companies do not even exist today.<br /><br />The book was first published in 1994 and a lot has changed since then. It is interesting to note that today (2012) few of the visionary companies are performing worse than their comparison company. And over the years I have heard readers being disappointed with the selection of companies and even stated, \\"This book is wrong, you see, these companies were not build to last\\".¹<br /><br />I believe the key to understand the book lessons, is not by focusing on the specific companies, but it is by observing the characteristics and concepts which define visionary companies as brilliantly described in this book.<br /><br />I highly recommend the book for leaders of companies, builders of companies and all who wish to understand how a company can be built (or changed) to last.<br /><br />Amir Avitzur<br />Author of \\"Why do we sell low and buy high? The guide you must read BEFORE you invest\\"<br /><br />¹ Mr. Collins researched and wrote about the cause of companies to fail in a more recent book called \\"How the mighty fall\\".

0385344228|5.0|Ooof.  I still feel like the wind was knocked out of me by the punch this book delivers in the ending.  And I mean that in a good way.  It wasn't so much a \\"who done it\\" as seeing how justice played (or didn't play) out.  District Attorney Andy Barber, solid in his midlife in a Boston suburb finds himself caught in a parent's nightmare:  his son is accused of murder.  The story goes back in forth in time--before things happened, after things happened, transcripts of court testimony seemingly as they happened.... Very few people are who you expect them to be, and some of the side characters (Dr. Vogel and Duffy come to mind) are particularly interesting.  I had a teensy bit of trouble believing the character of Andy's father, but by that time, I was so caught up in the story I just wanted to keep reading and see how it ended. Very occasionally I was impatient with the \\"transcript\\" style of some of the testimony, but that's probably what it's like being in court. Asking the same question six different ways, or asking and reasking to establish the answer you want the jury will hear. Easy to recommend to older teens and adult readers looking for a page turner with human interest and courtroom drama.<br />About me: I'm a middle school/high school librarian<br />How I got this book: purchased for the library

0143121006|4.0|In 1937 the body of a young western woman, Pamela Werner, was found brutally murdered in Peking. An investigation was launched by Chinese police with British support but the murderer was never arrested and the crime was soon forgotten in the midst of the cataclysm of the second world war that engulfed China and the world thereafter.<br /><br />Paul French, the author of this book, in the course of researching the case found that after the police investigation wound up, having been obstructed throughout by a combination of bureaucratic corruption, racism, sexual hypocrisy and imperial pretensions, Pamela's father conducted his own enquiries. These uncovered significant new evidence including, almost certainly, the identity of the murderer and the circumstances of Pamela's death. The resulting book is a gripping non-fiction procedural which gives fascinating insight into Peking, and particularly its foreign community and foreign underclass of white Russian emigres and multinational adventurers and criminals, in the last days before the Japanese take-over.<br /><br />Pamela's death was, of course, just one of millions that would occur between the invasion of Manchuria and the bombing of Nagasaki. But the author is right to single it out: in focusing on the life and horrific death of one fiesty and blossoming young woman we are reminded that her story is a dreadfully ordinary one and representative of tens of thousands of others who in peacetime fall victim the way Pamela did.<br /><br />To say more would be to give too much away. Suffice to say that Paul French has produced a fine narrative of a single criminal case of the sort that remains horrifically commonplace over 70 years since Pamela's awful death on a cold Peking night.

B005LAIIJY|5.0|Django (Jamie Foxx) is a slave, procured by bounty hunter Dr King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) in 1858 Texas to help him track down three criminal brothers with a substantial reward on their heads, dead or alive. In the course of this bounty hunting work Schultz and Django become friends and so Schultz proposes that he help Django rescue his wife (Kerry Washington) who has been sold to the vile Calvin Candy (Leonardo DiCaprio). This brings them into the heart of Mississippi slave country and the ever more repulsive realities of slavery.<br /><br />Quentin Tarantino has sometimes been accused of making gratuitously violent movies. Here, given the realities of US slavery, he could be accused of being overly restrained. It is a nice touch that the most sympathetic and moral white character in the movie, King Schultz, is a bounty hunter who kills for a living: compared to the supposedly refined \\"plantocracy\\" of the South, Schultz is a paragon of human decency revolted by the crass pretensions and horrific brutality of the slavers.<br /><br />As is Tarantino's wont the film is interspersed with a series of spectacular, and spectacularly bloody, shoot outs filmed in stunning locations. Between the killings there is heaps of literate and often very funny dialogue delivered through note-perfect performances by Foxx, Washington, DiCaprio, Waltz and, most particularly, Samuel L Jackson as the terrifying and malevolent Stephen, the chief \\"houseboy\\" of DiCaprio's Candyland.<br /><br />Foxx's Django describes himself at one point in the movie as \\"1 in 10,000\\" prepared to fight for his freedom and that of those his loves. However it would be more precise to say he was \\"1 in 20\\": Django is a fictional precursor of the 200,000 black troops who fought against the Confederacy and thereby ensured that slavery abolition became the central purpose of the American Civil War and with that four million slaves obtain freedom.<br /><br />Still Django Unchained is an extraordinary and exhilarating work of cinema. Time will tell but it may well prove to be a classic.ng work of cinema. Time will tell but it may well prove to be a classic.

B008CX2A2I|2.0|Sarcasm alert.... if you only want to listen to your phone or other bluetooth device on your Onkyo receiver, then this product is for you!<br /><br />However, If you want to watch movies, listen to the built in internet apps (which work flawlessly), or use your receiver for anything other than bluetooth then stay away!  First off, I refuse to turn off bluetooth on my iPhone or unplug the UBT-1 everytime I use my Onkyo TX-NR818 for something other than bluetooth audio... that's not the point of bluetooth.  When the UBT-1 is inserted into a USB port on my TX-NR818 it hijacks the audio every chance it gets.  Unlock your iPhone for any reason and your movie will stop and your receiver will switch to bluetooth.  Receive a text or any alert and your favorite song on Pandora Internet Radio will stop and your receiver will switch to bluetooth.  I've contacted Onkyo and they have no resolution but admit they've had other costumers with the same complaint.  I'm returning my UBT-1 and using my ancient Blackberry Music Bluetooth Stereo Gateway A2DP.  The A2DP has great sound and offers better integration with my TX-NR818 than Onkyo's own product.<br /><br />Onkyo developers.... please study the Sony STR DN1030!!  It has inferior sound quality and a frustrating user interface compared with the TX-NR818 but the bluetooth integration is phenominal!  It's simple to control the bluetooth with your iPhone or the receiver and it simply works.  I can enter my house, open Pandora on my iPhone and push the bluetooth icon and the Sony STR DN1030 turns on and starts playing.  Brilliant!  Too bad the mediocre sound quality prompted me to replace it with the TX-NR818.
0525478817|5.0|It's been a long time since I read a book that made me cry.<br /><br />Pass the tissues please.<br /><br />It's not even that this book was terribly sad. Of course it is, it has its moments. It is, after all, a book about cancer patients - young cancer patients - and all that comes along with that death sentence of a diagnosis. The sad parts were, well, sad - the eulogies written before death, hopes shattered, dreams stripped away. But it wasn't the desolation that got to me. The Sad wasn't what consumed this book or consumed me.<br /><br />The Bittersweet. That's what got me.<br /><br />It's a book about cancer patients. And The Sad. The impact. The grenade. The loss. The way life goes on. The impact we want to make with our lives. The impact we never quite reach.<br /><br />Ashes to ashes and whatnot.<br /><br />The Bittersweet...it got me. Living in a moment you know can't last. Living in a moment and knowing YOU can't last. You won't last. Your time is short and even shorter for some.<br /><br />John Green attempts to make sense of the senseless with this little gem. That's what it is, after all. Senseless. Seventeen year olds aren't supposed to die from cancer. Seventeen years aren't supposed to be cheated out of lives they'll never get the chance to live.<br /><br />Sad books aren't normally something I reach for; my shelves aren't lined with tragedy. Life is hard enough without immersing yourself in someone else's personal hell for 318 pages, but I'm glad I did with this one.<br /><br />That Bittersweet...the bittersweet made it worth it.<br /><br />This John Green cat... he knows his way around language and has the ability to craft a sentence that makes me stop and read it again immediately because I want that little piece of beauty seared into my memory forever.<br /><br />It got me.

This man is more than an ace musician, he's an erudite, eloquent writer as well. Highly recommended.
1481251880|5.0|For my first book review ever, I must say, it took a book like Hopeless to inspire me to write.  It was a departure from my Fifty Shades and Bared to You flavor but well worth the diversion.  Sky and Holder are just so... complicated, sweet, passionate, and intense - you can't tear yourself away from them for a moment.<br /><br />You are so rooting for Sky to dive head first into this relationship - and then you're throwing her a life line so she doesn't drown in the process of it.  You want to hug Holder, kiss Holder, and then shake him until his eyes rattle because you're so frustrated with him - - UGH, he is such a guy!!<br /><br />Just when you think the ice is thick enough to walk on - CRACK!  Down you all go into this spiraling story of twists and turns that sucks you in like a vortex that you are so hungry for, yet raw by the emotion of it all.<br /><br />Curl up with a soft blanket, a box of chocolate and let your laundry sit - it's gonna be a while - but you'll enjoy every minute

B006MW3V6U|5.0|The trials and tribulations of the upper class are both interesting in a historical sense and very entertaining. The story is engrossing and once I started watching Season 1 (just recently) - I couldn't stop. It does make me grateful that I live in modern day times, however.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Pretty graphics. Easy. Fun. More mini games would be nice. So far, so good. Here are six more random words.
B004YW4L5K|5.0|I read this book when it was first published and instantly fell in love with the imagery and the world that Gaiman created. To have it again in this Anniversary Edition with additional scenes is amazing! Gaiman is a true master of the written word. His worlds are so vividly drawn with his words that you feel as if you are in them.
B007THA4FI|4.0|Based on some of the other comments here and reviews of the book my expectations were not too high, but it really enjoyed it.  A great group of characters who were very human and believable, and an interesting socially relevant plot.  If you are expecting Harry Potter you may be disappointed, but I enjoyed this exploration of Muggle land.
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|This book series is wonderful. It is a fun read and is the reason my son has taken an active interest in reading. The quippy nature of the narrators voice took me off guard at first but it is good natured and not inappropriate for the age level it is aimed at.
B006PHD0RW|3.0|this game is pretty addicting and fun. I enjoyed it but I would have liked to see more tips and how to's to get through more levels. I found myself having to google how to get through certain levels and tips and tricks.
B000N2HBSO|4.0|Would have given it 5 stars, but Kearns-Goodwin opted out of having it text to speech.  Seriously, how much money is too much?  I heard the audio, and it isn't worth the literary distinction.<br />I am thoroughly enjoying the book itself.  Facts are overlapped (repeated) which is nice given the volume.  This makes needed to backtrack to remember unnecessary.  It is written to an intelligent reader and I enjoy looking up a word or two on my Kindle.  Worth purchasing if I'm being totally honest.  : )
B00AAX68HG|5.0|If you liked the physics skill it took to play cut the rope, this game is for you because it tests spatial reasoning skills. Also, the little pudding monsters are adorable!
B0096PYUE2|4.0|it works well, but I don't have anything to compare it with. I needed something for a Galaxy tab 10.1
B0002W19KQ|4.0|Wish it had subtitle and keep the native language, French. Quality is poor, I believe it is becaus the movie is 13 years old and they didn't have the technology to record it in higher definition. I wish they remastered this movie. Good movie though. A masterpiece.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Nice game. Good beginning game to learn how to play. Good for young kids to play. Easy enough but also challenging.
B002SQNM9A|5.0|A &#34;country&#34; way of singing carols and a calm and warm voice to keep you warm when the weather outside is frightful.
1451696205|5.0|This book is my favroite book and has been for many years now. I plan on reading my copy again and again, the product was in perfect condition
B00APUYN0I|4.0|For music fans, especially &#34;Choir Nerds&#34; this is a great movie. Full of outstanding music, arranged in new fresh ways.  Set in college it could have been way more inappropriate but the writers kept it about the music with just enough adult humor to keep mom and dad laughing and not make us uncomfortable to watch it with our tweeners.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Just started using this app...lots to learn about taking care of and enjoying your own horse. will occupy you for hours. very entertaining.
B004FP1WX0|2.0|I enjoy the tv show, so thought I'd watch the movie. The movie leaves you feeling depressed. As far the movie being labeled as suspense and thriller, ummm no. The show is 10 times better than this crock.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|The best diary of a wimpy kid ever it is so funny too and kinda weird too but a great book
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was wonderful. I didn't expect it to be a love story but the whole thing engulfed me. I couldn't put it down!
B002361MLA|5.0|This book is awesome, It may not change your life, but then again, it just might<br /> : )  I have not viewed things the same way since reading this
B00992CF6W|5.0|If there was a three word minimum, that would be  all I need. Here are the three words . BEST. APP. EVER. I'm so addicted that I play that game every chance I get. So far I've been thru about 30 worlds which  tells u in my opinion it's the best app ever. It may not be the full version but still it's my favorite app on my Kindle Fire. Minecraft  Pocket Edition is not a waste of time and money.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|My son just completely livef this set! Gor anyone who is a Beatles fan ....you cannot go wrong with this purchase.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|different to what ive read before but really enjoyed about a lifestyle foreign to  me my school days belong to a different era
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Tom Clancy has done it again! The Jack Ryan story line continues with his son Jack jr. I'm looking forward to the next installment as the world is a safer place with the Ryan's in charge!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Great simple app - does just what it's supposed to.  Love the way you can change color of the battery.  Works well on Kindle Fire HD.
B001HNE3NO|4.0|after i listened to this book on tape, I gave the book to a friend on her Kindle. I hope she enjoyed reading it as much as I did.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Just got back into reading the series again....1 of several authors i enjoy and this was a great novel in my opinion.
B009O2XY12|4.0|Nothing spectacular, but fun and addicting for both children and adults. Graphics are great for kids. App does work fine.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|I finally read this since it kept popping up in my recommended reading lists - everywhere I went, there it was, and I had NO interest in it. I am SO glad I broke down and read it. It was fast paced, interesting, and just all around a good read.
B00AE2LJVS|4.0|The acting was good the casting was well done and I liked it. Be aware it many violent scenes, and is supposedly based on real events. I'm always surprised when the subject o making moonshine comes up in casual conversation how many folks don't know that the super-popular NASCAR races are a direct descendant of the practice by some country folks &#34;souping-up&#34; car engines and drive-lines as well as lightening certain other areas of regular cars and light trucks plus substantially strengthening others to meet the design goal of outrunning the law when the &#34;shiners&#34; made their usually night time deliveries. I lived five years in Atlanta. GA in the early/mid 1950s and they called the races &#34;stock car&#34; races back then. I enjoyed the movie.
0783225903|5.0|Sweet crazy movie. Kinda bummed that it was shipped to New Zealand with the wrong DVD area code, but the show was great. Recomend to all who enjoy outrageous retro-futuristic adventures.
0345529057|5.0|My son wanted this set of books for christmas, and nothing else. To get the set before christmas and have it waiting was a great feeling.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Shocking at first.  Didn't even know what some of the words meant.  Could not put it down though.  I am 3/4 of the way through the second book which I think is better than the first.
B007UW9WOQ|5.0|I am not a fan of documentaries but I must say this ranks among my favorite movies of all time. The movie goes through the life of Jiro and his ability to make the world's best sushi. His sole focus is perfection, and the director does a fantastic job at showcasing that. You can see how Jiro has an unbelievable degree of persistence and patience. He wants to get it right, every time, and then make it better than before. He is never satisfied. I never say this - but this movie was truly inspirational. I walked away wanting (1) to eat sushi and (2) to be as good as Jiro. If you are a fan of underdog stories and people who are brilliant but under the radar, this is for you.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|What an interesting take on love and relationships.  Chuck full of all the searing emotions of a new and profound love.
B009ZQ8FQG|3.0|I expected to get the entire pilot version that was shown on PBS.org. I will have to decide later if i purchase any more episodes.
B007SGM084|5.0|Absolute best romance novels ever!  Fifty Shades of Grey ends with such a cliff hanger that you are compelled to move on the next novel and so on.  I was totally entranced and could not put my Kindle down.
B006T5C5PS|5.0|We don't realized how important is nutrition to our health, this book is incredible, the information is overwhelming on how important is eating right to defeat disease!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|We read this book first before allowing our 10 year old to read it.  We feared it might be too graphic or upsetting but it seemed ok.  Our daughter loved it. The first book is better than the second and third in my opinion.
B008B92U32|4.0|My Grandson downloaded it for rme when visiting for Christmas.  We had a ball switching everyone.  There were many laughs.
0061969656|5.0|I can't think of a writer that brings history to life like Bernard Cornwell. Cant wait for next book in the series.
159420411X|5.0|Loved reading this book.  The author has given a detailed, but easily digestible account of statistics in our lives.  Very well written with lots of real life and fun examples.  This was especially interesting to me as my research involves using Bayesian statistics.
0007466064|5.0|Started watching the series on Cable.  Had to read the books.  How he keeps all the characters straight in his own head absolutely amazes me.  Don't know how they are going to translate this to the series.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Both my 7-year old grandson and I enjoy this game. It challenges the mind and the eye in a fun and engaging way -- and the challenge is always new!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I very much enjoyed this book and looking forward to the next one.  I will recommend it to my friends.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Good battery app<br />Keeps track of usage time for many different functions and has great visual appeal.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for more battery I sight than the standard icon provides
B008TRUDAS|5.0|YESTERDAY I READ HOPELESS (IN ONE SITTING)  COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN!  AT MIDNIGHT LAST NIGHT I WAS LOOKING FOR ANOTHER BOOK BY THE SAME AUTHOR AND FOUND SLAMMED!  I READ THE FIRST CHAPTER LAST NIGHT AND FINISHED THE BOOK BY NOON TODAY!  LOVE THIS AUTHOR - NO SPOILERS HERE - SHE SUCKS YOU IN ON THE FIRST PAGE AND I JUST COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN!  JUST ORDERED THE SEQUEL AND CAN'T WAIT TO START IT!  I AM SENDING OUT EMAILS TO ALL MY &#34;READING&#34; FRIENDS - CHECK OUT THE COLLEEN HOOVER BOOKS - YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|great graphics with lots of hints for those who prefer a casual game. I would buy their games again any time.
0765325950|5.0|A fantastic ending to one of the best fantasy series ever written. Brandon Sanderson does a fantastic job of wrapping up all of the story lines, while still never giving the impression that he is rushing through the story.
B000OSC3GM|4.0|+A classic 1960's film during the cold war and nuclear scare. Speaks to the relationship of President Kennedy and his generals-but taken to an extreme. Great cast and acting consistent with the era it was made.
6305265666|5.0|Movie was in great condition, shipped quickly, and used as a Christmas present. Thank you. I hope you have a great new year
B00A9C3RB8|1.0|An old woman whining about her husband's lack of sex drive..... Duh.  guys lose interest after 70, get over it. Stupid, contrived and a pure waste of two talented actors.
B003E8P9G0|4.0|It is not as good as the rest of the series to much back and forth in there but it is a good book
B006VFLIYK|5.0|An absolutely fantastic book. Robie was a great character. A reluctant assassin struggling with his own morality, not to mention his skills and resourcefulness. I wouldn't want to mess with him! Julie was just as intriguing a character. The things that poor girl went through would make anybody flawed emotionally. The pace and action were excellent! Non-stop! The dialogue was good. The sarcastic wit and banter between Robie and Julie added to the book as opposed to hindering it. I hope this has the possibility of a series.
B00004TB7C|1.0|This was listed as being a vinyl record yet it was not. Clearly needs to be recategorized. Also, the cd did not have a booklet. Super crappy sale from a company that clearly does not care!
B0058W74UY|1.0|I tried downloading this flash player and others in Google Apps for my Kindle Fire HD only to learn that none of them like Dolphin or even Foxfire will download either. It is my honest opinion that recommending this product would be a waste of time and money. Mzunderstood.
B009OCR1X4|5.0|Wow! The film was great. I totally hate the Oscars and the Golden Globes because Cloud Atlas didn't win any award. However, nothing can change the sublime beauty of this film and its music. I don't have the technical jargon to critique the music properly (there's an excellent review done already somewhere here)- but I just want to say that I am touched by the music, especially the end title and the finale. It makes me feel sad and joyful at the same time. There's something in the music that makes me yearn for more out of life, long for a better version of myself, and desire to make an impact in this world. The music simply tugs at your heartstrings. You won't be sorry if you buy this album. It's totally worth your hard-earned money!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Ok this book is good,but I have to b disappointed in things that seem to be left out,well c for you're self, ls
B006QQQ5SI|5.0|loved it as a birder it was great.  So like many birders, they have to see the bird before they will count it
B0083B3KOQ|1.0|I was trying to get a video file that I wanted to watch on my Kindle to MP4 format...bought and downloaded this...found out it would only convert files less than 1 gb.....WHY DIDN'T THEY TELL ME THIS IN THE DESCRIPTION???!!!
B009NPKTN6|5.0|Excellent soundtrack!  Story line is easy to follow while still enjoying the music.  And funny!  If you like hair bands this is the movie for you!
B003WUYRGI|4.0|This is a big awesome dictionary and I'm glad I (sorta) read it. Awesome dictionary for people who like looking up words. =)
0553582038|5.0|This is the best series I have read in a long time and A Feast for Crows just keeps it going.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|After quite a bit of vacillating, my wife and I finally saw this in our local theater today. Why the hesitancy? We have seen it twice on stage, including a memorable performance in New York with the wonderful Colm Wilkinson.  We felt there was just too much potential downside, what with casting \\"Movie Stars\\" who lent their big names to the production but probably wouldn't be able to sing a lick.<br />Well, I'm now back from the movie, and it was wonderful!  For the most part the voices were very very good.  Russell Crowe is certainly the weak link here, but i have to say that his acting \\"almost\\" made up for his poor vocal skills.  Hugh Jackman will not make anyone forget Wilkinson, but he was surprisingly good, and Anne Hathaway deserves all the Oscar buzz. What a wonderful performance she gave!<br />I also strongly agree with those who applaud Eddie Redmayne's performance. He was wonderful, as good as any stage Marius I have seen.<br />Please, if you have or if you haven't seen the stage production, please see this movie! You will love it.<br />(I must admit that when I got home I plugged in my DVD of the 25th anniversary edition, which is simply wonderful.  Still, I plan to order this movie on DVD and maybe even see it again in the movie theater. It is that good!<br />I'm glad they can still adapt musicals for the silver screen so well!<br /><br />Jim
B00ALQUV66|5.0|This is one of the best, if not the best dinosaur documentary I have ever seen! My favorite part about it is how it features species of dinosaurs that I don't usually see in other documentaries, like Spinosaurus, Carcharodontosaurus, and Microraptor. The series is very detailed and gives a lot of information. Another thing about it is that it isn't just a bunch of dinosaurs eating things and fighting each other. When they fight, eat things, or have certain features, it always explains why they are doing what they are doing or why they look how they look in the film, usually with fossil evidence. I also find that the series is very accurate except in a few cases. (Example: The Troodons do not have feathers, which many scientists think that they did.) Overall, I think this is an excellent documentary, and is worth the $10.99 that it costs.
1451695195|2.0|I think the vast majority of us bought / read this book to learn what happened during Alexander's visit to the other side.  Unfortunately, I got only three things from the (extremely brief) narrative of his experience:  he spent time in a dark and muddy hole without any knowledge of who he was and why he was there, he took aerial journeys with a girl on a butterfly wing to view the lush countryside below, and he learned from God (or om, as Alexander names Him) that love is the most important thing.<br /><br />While I believe there is certainly life after death, and Alexander visited Heaven, his account is extremely lacking in detail and content.  In fairness to Alexander, it may indeed be difficult for him to put into words his experiences, but that's what we want to know.<br /><br />I've read quite a few accounts of NDEs, and this is the first time I've heard of a dark and muddy hole.  HIs NDE is noticeably different from other people's experiences, and I wonder why that is the case.  He doesn't tell us why.  Maybe there will be a sequel.
B0015DYIH2|4.0|I was not a true fan. I enjoyed the movies but this book hooked me for always. now what  is to come next is my next question.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book held my attention clear through to the end.  I had trouble putting it down.  The wit, wisdom, love and understanding of Enzo surpasses all.  We should all be so lucky to have a friend like him.
B00B19DMUE|2.0|The characters were underdeveloped. The story line could have been bested by an average junior high school student’s composition. All in all this would be a fair 99 cent rental, but not a penny more. I found the exciting parts of the movie to be drab and lacking of panache. This could have been so much better with just some effort. Movies of this quality often bypass the theater and go directly to DVD. ~ Two Stars
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Emotionally exhausting. You feel like you've run a marathon after reading this book. I loved every word of every page but don't know that I would recommend  unless one just loves the torture.
B008I3IXEG|4.0|Not a bad movie for the money.  It's certainly not his best work, but still pretty funny.  We will surely watch it more than a few times over the years.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|I like the setup of this and it works very well for my MMOs and FPS games.<br />Very customizable and sturdy.  Worked well out of the box for me.
B00267QOEQ|5.0|Classic Adam Sandler movie about an introverted and socially awkward waterboy with a mean tackle. Hilarious movie, this is always recommended.
B002UZCJ8Y|5.0|I liked this movie when it came out<br />Added it to my collection as many people missed it<br />It's a well put together scifi movie imo
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Very good story line. Just enough mystery and romance.  Always like N Sparks books.  they never disappoint. Safe Haven One of the best
B004LWZWGK|5.0|While I still think the second movie is the best, this is a nice ending to the best batman movie series so far (in my opinion).  Christopher Nolan did a wonderful job of re-introducing this classic character and world).
B0053F03MM|4.0|I liked that the end was somewhat unexpecting and I could see a Source Code II. It kept my attention and would watch it again!
B00B19DMUE|2.0|Given that &#34;The Exorcist&#34; has existed as the Gold Standard for this genre for 40 years now, this movie was stunningly inferior.  How can the producers, director, and writers live with such dreck (one gets to use a yiddishism when evaluating this movie)?
B004GJDQT8|5.0|I installed it a couple days ago.  All seems to be going well.  I downloaded my first book to my tablet.
0385535147|4.0|THE RACKETEER:After 4 months of wait, I got the book from library. Another Grisham's semi legal suspense novel.<br />Malcom Bannister, an african-american lawyer convicted of money laundering, sentenced 10 years. Malcom was caught in the<br />scheme unknowingly. While in the prison, he met with couple other inmates. Inmates seek his legal expertise and some have confided in him.<br /><br />When the corruptive federal judge was killed, Malcom knew who did it. He hatch a plan for his release upon an agreement with the FBI that he would reveal the killer. He names Quinn Rucker(another inmate, who is at large) is the killer.<br />FBI indicts Quinn just by his confession that was weak and wouldn't stand at the trail 'cause lack of evidence.<br /><br />Malcom goes through cosmetic surgery and hatch another plan to steal the gold from the killer. After the success(?),he calls the FBI and reveal the real killer's name, upon agreement of his immunity from legal charges. Was Malcom successful is pulling-off his plan?, how does he do it?.<br /><br />Probably not Grisham's best but better than the last two. Story is compact. I usually do not skip the pages with Grisham's novel, but there's some fluff. Malcom's plan & it's execution seems to be too much dependent on luck to be successfull.<br /><br />I kinda knew Malcom's plan and the real killer before last 100 pages, but kept going to see whether he could pull-off the<br />plan successfully or not. He does very plainly without much twist, disappointed there, but John Grisham's is always a<br />delightful read.<br /><br />Recommended...?, yes. Stars 3.5 out of 5. 'The Partner' still stands as my favorite.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I LOVE LOVE LOVE this book...it's a definite re-read book many times over...Jamie really captures each character and I totally LOVE Travis and Abby..
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Science fiction can be written very poorly, or a good idea can be left to wither without details and planning.  This book series is great, lots of twists and surprises, I was happy to spend the money on it and look forward to the next chapter in the lives of the characters.<br /><br />This book was great, I hope to see more from this author!
B000S5ASM2|5.0|Haunting but charming and imaginative use of slave melodies, which sets it apart from the more stately and flowing &#34;The Moldau&#34; 
B0018QOIXU|3.0|I figured millions of fans can't be wrong and Make You Feel My Love was my favorite song last year. I thought Adele sang it incredibly movingly. I was so, so, so disappointed. The rest of the album is nothing like it. And, now that I know Bob Dylan wrote this song, it is clear why. Had I know this previously, I would not have bought this album without checking the track beforehand.<br /><br />I don't' think there's anything wrong with the album. I'm 55 and this music isn't aimed at me, but, being a musician myself, what I do know is that when music is brilliant, it will transcend its target audience.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|What else can I say?  Once you get hooked on Dexter, having each season is a must!  I have all of them so far and will continue to buy each season as it becomes available.
1451695195|4.0|I started out really loving this book, but the longer I read, the less I was drawn in. I believe Eben Alexander. I've even had experiences similar to his.<br /><br />What I came away with was two-fold. One, seeing some of my own experiences validated in print, unexpectedly, ended up doing nothing for me. Two, no matter how transcended an experience is, nothing makes up for the educating and change-causing effect of a long journey &#34;there,&#34; as opposed to a leap, such as is caused by a near death experience. I very much hope to read more from Mr Alexander once his ordinary life experience has caught up to his transcended experience.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|It is an unbelievable story that somehow became more believable as i continued reading, so much so that the denouement was almost shocking to my suspended disbelief.
8876250441|5.0|I was very pleased and surprised that my purchase arrived a lot earlier than expected. Great job, keep it up!!!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|have it on the kindle fire and it works great. smooth card play and no glitches. been playing it nonstop for days
B0002TJGQS|4.0|This is the 2nd order I've placed for this item from the same seller.  I remember the first order taking &#34;a while&#34; to arrive so I placed the second order before I really needed the batteries.  This order was placed on January 8th and arrived January 22nd.  Granted, there was no mail service on MLK day but don't expect these to arrive within a week after placing your order.  USPS from California to Indiana shouldn't be 14 days.  The price is right and it was free shipping so I'll still give 4 stars.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I was afraid. I admit it, I had picked up a paperback in the 90's and couldn't get through 50 pages...now older, not really wiser, I am enjoying this book immensely!
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|A very good read for fantasy lovers. I was glad I had time to just keep<br />reading, as I did not want to put the book down.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|This is an exceptional book.  I am struck by how little things have changed in terms of the political divisiveness, and by how skilled Abraham Lincoln was at &#34;crossing the aisle&#34; and bringing people together towards a common cause.  This should be mandatory reading for every single congressman and senator.
B001P9EQH8|3.0|We got this item to use with a headphone splitter to power two big pairs of headphones from my tablet. I notice little difference between using it and bypassing it. The clip-on design, however, is very useful. I can clip it to the stand-up case I have my tablet in to keep it out of the way and prevent it from hanging off the cords. It does have some sort of equalizer/bass boost button, which can make things sound better than without it. Overall, though, it may not have been worth buying.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am so addicted to this site and app. I look at it everyday. I have cooked tons of recipes and found lots of DIY projects that I have tried and cant wait to try.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Great story, follows Harry Bosch's life and career well.  I have read all the Harry Bosch novels and enjoy them immensely.
B006M4F67A|5.0|This game is very entertaining and enjoyable. Beautiful tiles and lots of variations to keep me entertained for hours. So addicting I cannot stop playing! play just one game I dare you.
B007Z5WMCW|2.0|I did not like this app at all. I was unable to view anything with it. It was a complete waste of time.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|It's ok, just not the way I play Mah Jongg. I keep trying, perhaps I'll be able to give it a better rating at a later date.
B0086700CM|3.0|I am not really fond of the game after having down loaded it. I can take the game or leave it.
B007VDN1PA|5.0|I didn't try too hard to make my digitial images perfect, but I was able to get the images off of the slides and into my computer.
B006AZZPCM|4.0|The product is fine. I don't have a problem with it.  The improvements that were made are good and it looks great.
B00005T30L|5.0|Ghost World is brilliant. The cast is fantastic, and the music a true gift. I think we all can relate to this coming of age story.
B006GLM5EQ|5.0|Great show. Interesting story. Can't stop watching. Addictive television at its finest. I recommend to all adults who like compelling, thought-provoking drama.
B0041T52S6|3.0|I thought is was just alright. There were many parts that I liked, and many parts that I didn't care for. Would I tell you to watch it? Yes. Would I recommend owning it? Not unless you liked it the first time.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I recommend this book to anyone that wants to be lost in another place and enjoy every minute of it.
B009O2XY12|2.0|I was hoping that I would not have to be connected to the internet the entire time I was playing it but you have to be
B00AWTTUHI|5.0|This is the best animated Batman movie ever.  It capture most of the original comic, accept the fight scenes are WAY cooler.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|My son loves angry birds and this is good for his hand eye cordination. It keeps him busy at times, like in the car on trips so he does not get bored
B00A0SJWQU|2.0|Don't waste your money on this movie, the original is so much better. The story seems pretty made up and contrived, and is missing all the charm of the original Mars setting. The only thing that keeps the movie from getting 1 star is Kate Beckinsale.
B002N5N5LG|3.0|thought with chevy chase that this would be hilarious and i really tried to like it but it fell flat.
B0089EHWQE|2.0|I wanted to give this book a 5 star but I couldn't do it because I felt like I'd be letting my cousin down who is a quad and just like the character lived a large life until his senior graduation.  My cousin is just like the character too and has a bit of use of his arms and hands and has been this way now for 17 years.  I felt like by having the character chose death the author was saying hey if you aren't an AB well why live. My cousin drives, has his own house and no aide that lives with him in fact no aide at all. He has had many girlfriends who are the most beautiful women. One went on to marry a major baseball league pitcher so let me tell you something JoJo Moyes you can live a large life as a quad.<br />I thought maybe at the end she would explain herself that would turn my anger around but she never did and I just feel so sad for her that she chose this ending how can she be so small minded. Yes the book was well written and I couldn't put it down But I am sorry I read it and that I payed 14.99 for the kindle addition but at least I don't have the book sitting on a shelf as a constant reminder of her narrow mindedness. I know it can't all be ferry tale endings that's not what angered me.  She must not really know anyone that is a quad because they truly can live. My cousin can cook like you wouldn't believe! Now to all you quads that find that sure it's hard but you overcome those obstacles and find a new way of doing things and live full happy lives I raise my glass to you because living is about taking what we  are dealt and finding happiness so cheers to you.
B002GHHHME|3.0|why is this dvd tape writeing every words the movie is saying i dont like this in a move i dont want to read what that are say in the movie how can i stop this?
B005VTS4EY|5.0|good time waster, easy to begin, becomes more challenging. i like it a bunch and its a creative take on a puzzle game
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was absolutely beautifully written. It grabbed my heart and didn't let go, and I loved it. It was smart, witty and incredibly insightful. I recommend it highly.
B00973DDN2|5.0|I've never listened to The Killers before this album. I had no idea what I was getting into, nor did I have any sort of expectations about how most others felt about this album. A friend recommended it, and I bought it on a whim with a free album credit.<br /><br />Every song has a life of its own. Sometimes, artists have a tendency to produce redundant material from song to song. But after only my third listen, I was able to distinguish every song within like 5 or 10 seconds. Not that you care about my ability to do this, but I mention it to highlight just how each song is its own wonderful creation. There's a range here that is missing these days. Because of that, my favorite song from the album changes on a weekly, sometimes daily, basis.<br /><br />I can't compare it to their other works, so I would turn to another review for that. I also find it ridiculous to compare artists because of the nuances among not only other artists but also among their own works. But if you are like me and wondering whether you should give it a chance, I'd say go ahead and jump on in.

B005MYEPXC|5.0|Many people have been to Paris who have had their romantic notions of the city completely deflated. I have not been to Paris, nor have I ever felt this overwhelming sense of grandeur. Don't get me wrong, I would like to visit it one day. There's too much history, food, and shopping to be done. But what struck me about this movie was that it is Woody Allen's love letter to the city.<br /><br />I'll leave a synopsis to others. Just know that this film unfolds very (super)naturally, in that it is true to its characters. If I had one complaint, it may be that we needed one more scene between Owen Wilson and Lea Seydoux. Other than that, every creative decision serves the film; in a word, it's cinematic magic.<br /><br />If I ever love anything as much as Woody Allen loves Paris, I'd be the Paula Deen to its butter. Seriously, though, I was completely on the side of Owen Wilson's character. You could just feel his awe and wonder as the film unfolded. Perhaps this is due to the screenplay along with Wilson's performance; is this Wilson's career best?<br /><br />Suddenly, &#34;Paris, je t'aime&#34; makes much more sense.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I have been playing for a while and have gotten to a very difficult flow but am determined to crack it. It seems to be a good game and I look forward to playing it again.
B0060ZJ74O|5.0|This is not a sports film. If anything, it reminds me more of &#34;Margin Call&#34; or &#34;Wall Street.&#34;<br /><br />This is a film about two people going against all odds. It's about their struggle to establish an identity and philosophy. We care more about what happens to them off the field than we do on the field.<br /><br />This is probably Brad Pitt's finest performance. A lot of other well-deserving nominees were up that year, so I won't say he should have won the Oscar. But the nomination was earned.<br /><br />If you are invested in characters and their story, then this film has a good amount of payoff. You will find the number crunching and negotiating ten times more interesting than what little baseball action there is. In fact, anyone going in expecting &#34;The Natural&#34; or &#34;A League of Their Own&#34; will be 1) disappointed and 2) missing out.<br /><br />An easy choice for 5 stars.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Gripping throughout. My only concern is the newly added characters and how they come into the story. Some you'll love others you'll not. But it always keeps you reading.
B00APUYN0I|3.0|it was entertaining, funny, and good girlfriend movie. It's a good movie to watch with some girlfriends. You don't have to watch this movie in HD.
B002MQYOFW|1.0|I wish somebody could explian to me why this book is so popular. Everything about it is bad bad bad. It's a total ripoff of Battle Royal and people go on acting like this writer is even a bit of good. The movie isn't even good and they put that ugly chick in the movie an pretended like she was all pretty . I hate this book. I hate anybody who likes this book. If you like this book you are an idiot!
B009IF8CH6|5.0|The first season that Bernadette and Amy are part of the main cast. The main storylines and sub-plot is separated amongst the male and female cast with lots of cross over. The show somehow remains fresh after six years. Sheldon continues to grow as a boyfriend while finding himself in trouble sometimes due to his lack of social skills. This is the only sitcom we watch.
B004SIP6A4|4.0|In 2002, Chicago became the first musical to win the Best Picture Oscar since Oliver in 1968.  While some may argue (including me) that The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers was the better movie, that is not to take away from the excellence of the film.  Both Renee Zellweger and Catherine Zeta-Jones shine in their roles and Queen Latifah isn't far behind.  John C. Reilly shows he can excel in any genre of film.  Richard Gere is a very stiff in the musical numbers, but he brings the right amount swarm to his lawyer character.  Director Rob Marshall invokes a style of a Broadway play with the set designs and director.  He perfectly captures the essence of the original show.
B008RV5K5E|5.0|Based on the book that arguably is responsible for the dark Batman of today, this is a direct interpretation of the The Dark Knight Returns. The only thing really missing is Batman's thoughts, although the additional dialogue makes up for it, it will be missed by fans of the books.
B0042EJD8A|1.0|If you want the truth, watch &#34;FrackNation&#34;. Methane in well water has been documented for years and years. Seek the truth.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|There is a difference between &#34;movie&#34; and &#34;film&#34;. The Avengers falls into the movie category, and it's a blast. Like most superhero movies there are plot holes lots of explosions, but this movie is just so fun.
031606792X|4.0|Took more than 2 weeks to get it but...it was cheap so i'm not complaining. Seller answered my email about what was taking so long pretty fast.that was nice.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|A keeper. Beautiful movie, great actors and a true inspired story! Have seen it so many times and don't get tired of it.
B0055B7IPE|5.0|UP is an excellent study in visual story telling, set ups and payoffs and creating emotional moments. UP is a great way to learn how the professionals do it right while simultaneously entertaining us.
B000BB1MI2|5.0|What a phanamonal job Jonny Depp did in this role. Everyone with kids and grandchildren should own. No regrets in buying it, the only regret was not seeing it in the big Screen when it came out.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|This book came together so well! I had not realized that the book had been split into two. Still enjoyed it immensely!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I thought the book was so well written and that not only will teens enjoy the book  a woman of forty can too. I recommend the book for people that love a fast read! I read it in four hours. I feel in love with the main characters in this book and can appreciate the ending :)
B000FBFN1U|4.0|Really enjoyed this book and it explained so much about the minor houses. Can't wait till the season premier on HBO!

B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is one of the games they came out with  cant wait to see if they come out with a second part
B000087F6M|4.0|Liked the movie, and the price.  Sent incorrect item - someone else's.  They did immediately correct their error. Well done.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I love this game. It is so additive. I can't stop playing it. Every level gets more challenging. I like that it free.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I really like this game so far. like that it has a hint button for those tough spots. I will recommend this game to my friends.
B00AEFY08O|2.0|Forrest Gump can't decide whether it wants to be a comedy or drama, but it doesn't really matter, since it fails at both. A mentally challenged man (Gump) gets caught up in increasingly improbable situations throughout the 20th century. There's no real overall story arc.... just a bunch of random situations strung together. I didn't care about any of the characters at all; Gump doesn't evolve as a person, and goes through the movie spouting terrible one-liners. Most of the other characters are just jerks.<br /><br />I went into this movie with an open mind when it first came out, and boy was I disappointed. I honestly never saw what the appeal of this movie was, as I thought it was literally one of the worst movies of the '90's. The only bits I enjoyed were the scenes in Vietnam, and the special effects are pretty good. That's why I gave this two stars instead of one.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|this is a great book. First i thought it's not going to be realistic but the dog's point of view is very interesting to read. The writer did a great job. love this book
B0092MKFIY|5.0|If you like the singles that you have heard from the album, I can bet that you will also like the rest of the tracks.
B0032CVAQQ|2.0|I liked the ideas of the book but don't understand why it has to be about Christianity. I didn't pay money to have it shuffle in my face over and over again. DISAPPOINTMENT
B004RL9T50|5.0|My 13 year old has seen this movie 4 or 5 times and never tires of it! It's pretty funny for adults, too.
B00009TB5G|5.0|could not be more satisfied with this product. shipped fast, and safely. Extended material is amazing! could not be happier
B008745B32|2.0|Interesting read, not really sure what I expected. Tended to be a bit ponderous. Still, it was a nice change from the usual modern story I often pick up
B0052TDGQO|5.0|LOVE his voice and what a nice guy too. He is such a natural. I saw him the first night he sang his audition at Idol and said, this boy could win the show, and he did.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs has always been one of my favorite Disney animated movies; my daughter (who is now 21) and I still enjoy watching it!

B000PC0S5K|5.0|I have read this book at least 5 times now and always find that it helps me find peace.<br /><br />This too shall pass.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My granddaughter and I love this app. We play every time we get together. Thank you for letting a little girl dream.
B00AKL1XPU|3.0|This game is very well done but things cost a lot of money in game and it takes to long to earn it. Other than that, it's well thought out and quite fun!
B001FSDOZO|5.0|I do not think that Nickelback will ever create a CD that does not have great music on it. I know Here and Now was their last CD but I cannot wait till their next new CD comes out.  I hope they perform again some where near Philly, I do not care if I have to drive 2 hours to see them. I have seen them 3 times already and they were the best concerts I have ever been to.
B008OOYALE|4.0|This is as great game. Beautiful character and creative designs, but it does take awhile to get into and takes even longer to earn cash in game.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This season is amazing and it was SO easy to watch all the episodes I missed at once and at a VERY affordable price.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|It has been forever since I have read any book (let alone a series) like this!! Amazing story line! Totally captivates you from the first paragraph! I am on Book 7 and can't wait for what comes next!!<br />I read all 6 books in less than a week! Talented author!!
B000KJT8IG|5.0|great movie thanks, now we can watch it all the time around christmas especially at that time thanks alot ok
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Before I read this book, I had heard &#34;talk&#34; that this book was dirty and about a man who likes to beat women.  That is NOT at all what this book is about.  Its a VERY sexual, passionate Love Story.  READ IT!
B007GCY8FS|3.0|I have read 14 reacher novels and as I move from book to book further down the trail I find the novels have more filler and less actual readability
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I am giving this book 4 stars only because I read it right AFTER the 50 Shades series, which I loved.  This was also a good read, another love story, not as sexual as 50 shades, but good.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Good book but left me wondering. I really wish I knew who he was writing to. Easy and fun read.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|LOVED this series. Could not put it down. Read two books in 1 week (with a newborn in the house)
B008KW43TE|5.0|I give this 5 stars because I wouldn't expect him to make it any greater than it is! I can't find any negatives about this album.<br />It's unique and quite refreshing to hear something different than what you hear on the radio these days.<br />I recommend this to all lovers of artistic music, especially from intelligent artists. Hope this helps your decision.<br />~ At Diallokreed on Twitter
B007IXWKUK|5.0|LOVED this series. Could not put it down. Read two books in 1 week (with a newborn in the house)
B006OCM0G0|5.0|Love this game it keeps you on your toes maintaining the restuarant, keeping the customers happy by cooking lots of food and expanding the restuarant operation. it really challenges you to decide what to cook that will be quick verses something that takes 2 days so that your customers won't walk out. Word of advice do not purchase gems they will be charged to your credit card, make sure you earn them in the game.Time goes by very quick while you are playing this game. I highly recommend this game.
0307279189|4.0|Fast easy read. A great story with lots of knowledge. You will learn a ton about barefoot running. Which will help you with what ever type of running you do.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|This app is excellent for searching the internet. It allows you to perform everything you can do on a lap top or smartphone. I highly recommend this app.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|Its a seek and find. Thats what you do. The story line is a little funny. They say, 'we need to stop the poltergeist.'<br />Then when the next board, they have you find a clock or soda can. The story doesnt go with what you do next.<br />But, its a fun game. I like finding stuff, and this one has a ton of stuff to find.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I would highly recommend this app it is quick and great for calculations. It even displays great, I am impressed.
B000UR9T82|5.0|I got this for my Honey for Christmas. I received it on time and he absolutely loves it! Great Job!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I have fallen in love with this game app makes the time go by. It really challenges you and offers a variety of different board set ups. You won't get bored, I highly recommend this game app.
B007ZGBZHE|2.0|This Pendergast was not as interesting or absorbing as the others. Perhaps the well has run dry. The character development was shallow and the plot was thin and contrived.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|I like the. arena level design, and its a great time waster. however it lags a bit mhen to many enemy's are on screen
0802473156|5.0|This book is perfect for new couples as well as long time married couples. It explores many depths and feelings. It really makes you think about what is important in a relationship and how to take full advantage of the tools you  already posses. I would highly recommend reading this when there are doubts in a marriage. Great to have on hand to refer back to.
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|I was referred to the Jack Reacher books by a friend.  I decided to start with the first one.  I was disappointe in the illogical way that a lot of the book took place...bodies disposed of and never found...buildings on fire that fail to draw attention...etc.  I realize it is fiction, but appreciate a certain amount of believabiity.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I couldn't put the book down. I read all three in a week, and I don't normally read books ever...lol
1849904251|5.0|This book is absolutely brilliant. I loved the exclusive interviews, but the best part were the sticky-note comments from Sherlock, John, and occasionally even Mycroft! I laughed out loud nearly the entire time I was reading it--as a matter of fact, I read it in one sitting--until the Reichenbach Fall chapter, which broke my heart all over again. Once my friends saw my copy, they went out and bought copies too--it's not something to read just once. (OWN ALL THE SHERLOCK THINGS!) I imagine it would be very well-received as a gift to a Sherlock fan as well.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Again I couldn't put the 'Fifty' books down. This book makes me want more, I can't wait for the next set to come out!
B003QS67F0|5.0|Twists and turns at every corner. Gripping movie. Typical Christopher Nolan. I have watched many Nolan movies. They are all great.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I like all of Nicholas Sparks books.  I'm glad to hear Safe Haven will be a movie.  Should be good.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|This film is just fun.  It is a beautiful story of mother and daughter coming to understand each other, set against a beautiful backdrop.  The characters are funny and memorable.  I have already watched this ten times and plan to watch it again soon.
B0076DELIG|3.0|If you are a fan of Harry Bosch, this is another good story.  It is easy reading and well-crafted. An intriguing mystery.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|Any fan of Star Wars or Angry Birds will love this game.  It is the same old Angry Birds with a twist, but that is not a bad thing.
B0036BP6XQ|5.0|This is one of the best football movies of all time because it shows what compassion& faith can do. A great movie for the whole family.
B004SBS8LA|3.0|I downloaded this on my Android phone.  I'm not sure where &#34;ad-free&#34; comes from because it has plenty of advertisements.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|I really like this book it is really set up right for me to find something in the dictionary like a word that I didn't know the definition for that word. I would rate this 5-5 because it's really good!
B0055PGUYU|4.0|Enjoyed the book, found the insights intriguing. The manner in which they explain the concepts is quite easy to follow, I would recommend it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|get get get get get it is awesome get get get I love it and u will to it is awesome thus makes me happy.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book gives a very mind provoking look at why our minds are to primitive to understand the concept of a supreme being or after life. I really enjoyed the fact that Eben was agnostic prior to this experience and through the experience he understood how hard it would be for others like him to believe his story. Lends credibility to it all.
B0086700CM|5.0|If you are looking for a game to pass the time, then this endless game is perfect for you! There are many powerups to keep you going on ( until you die, of course).
1419705849|5.0|i love the book because its funny and how he explained his lifestyle. and how he is so funny and crazy.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book had me  at the beginning! It has  so many different emotions and a twisting end!! Grab some  tissues!!!
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Usually, I like to read a chapter at a time; however, when I reached the end of the first chapter I could not put the book down. It was like a magnetic pull had taken over. There are three books to this Pendergast series; you must read all three. Enjoy!
B00B0U2SEA|5.0|Steven Spielberg finally got the long awaited respect he deserved as director when he won the Oscar for his 3 hour 16 minute epic.  And now this excellent 20th Anniversary Blu ray finally arrives.  Spielberg shot in black and white because he says that is how he pictures all the events in his mind.  As a kid he had seen some photos and they were B & W.  With a splash of color at the beginning and end, he also tosses in an effective shot of a little girl walking through chaos wearing a red coat.<br /><br />Brilliant movie making but certainly not a movie that can be casually watched.  Nor is it a film that requires regular viewing.  Frankly it is difficult assignment most of the time.  In spite of the upbeat aura of Schindler's great good, the film also accurately depicts the horrors the Nazis bestowed upon Jews throughout Eastern Europe.  As one might expect, we see superb performances especially by Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes.  A masterpiece for all time.<br /><br />This Blu ray transfer includes a 1080p resolution and a 1.85:1 aspect ratio that matches the original.  Spielberg personally supervised the high definition transfer and the lossless audio (DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1) restoration of the film from the 35mm film original negative. Special features include:<br /><br />Voices from the List: Documentary featuring a number of testimonies and stories from men and women who survived the Holocaust thanks to Oskar Schindler.<br /><br />USC Shoah Foundation Story with Steven Spielberg

B00AIBZLVY|3.0|You might be wondering what acclaimed actress Jessica Chastain (\\"Zero Dark Thirty\\") is doing in a goofy-named horror flick.  She's actually in good company with award winning stars like Nicole Kidman (\\"The Others\\") and Naomi Watts (\\"The Ring\\" 1 & 2) to name a couple.  Here Chastain plays Annabel, a Suzi Quatro-like bassist in a punk rock band, complete with short dark hair and tatted up arms.  She is the main squeeze of Lucas, a starving artist type played by Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, perhaps best known as the incestuous prince on \\"Game of Thrones.\\"<br /><br />The story begins with the twin brother of Lucas going on a killing rampage that includes fellow workers and his wife.  He takes his 2 young daughters out into the country with similar intent.  Before he can commit the deed a mysterious apparition intervenes.  Five years later Lucas is still trying to find out what happened to his brother and nieces.<br /><br />Ultimately found, the girls have somehow managed to survive but are little more than wild animals.  Director Andres Muschietti manages to provide enough suspense to keep viewers on the edge on their seats using quick cuts and lighting.  At the same time, he also resorts to the usual \\"gotcha\\" moments complete with a jolting sound effect.<br /><br />Annabel is the main focus in the story however as the girlfriend who reluctantly has to take over child care duties after Lucas is hospitalized thanks to an induced fall down a flight of stairs.  Chastain is excellent in the role and proves her dramatic range.  \\"Mama\\" is an above average horror film that relies on suspense rather than gore for chilling effects.  For me the ghostly presence's transformation to a CGI manifestation in the final act was unnecessary and changes the tone of the film somewhat.  Still this is a pretty scary ghost story and worth a look.
0765325950|4.0|Robert Jordan first started writing the Wheel of Time series in 1984.  Almost 30 years later, the tale is finally done.  When Brandon Sanderson was brought in after the unfortunate death of Mr. Jordan (why did you have to write New Spring?!) I wasn't really sure what to think.  Sanderson is a very good writer in his own right, but in the end, I thought, wouldn't this just be like glorified, well-made fan fiction?<br /><br />Well, it is.  In the best possible way. Sanderson has done one heck of a job fighting the urge to make the story his, and instead does his best to finish the tale as he felt Jordan would have.  I know I could not have done the same.<br /><br />There are certainly pacing issues that come from writing a book that is essentially one long battle.  There are also issues with trying to finalize the lives of characters 29 years and 13 books in the making.<br /><br />But when you finally put the book down, 908 pages later, you will have closure to a tale that has occupied the greater part of many of our childhoods and adulthoods.  I couldn't really ask for more.
B002SR2PKG|5.0|This is the first book I ever read by Stephen King and I was 16 and it scared the bejesus out of me. To this day, 23 years later it still brings back the fear I had while reading it. He is a fantastic writer and I have read many other books by him over the years. If you want a book to scare you or just a great read, this book is it...

B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game is very enjoyable to play.  The game works  well without any stoppage.  I hope all the apps I load in the future work as well.
B007TKT2SK|1.0|kids should know how to do this in their heads or at least work it out on paper...like everything else, we are teaching our students to rely on all technology for solve problems.  An app like this stops kids from having to think
0547884591|5.0|its really a book with very light and easy meals. people who are dieting would find it very helpful, as did my friend who was it for
B005P4PAVK|5.0|I can definitely relate to the characters. I just wish they would remove the laugh tracks (or the audience). It's well written and well acted. King of the nerds!
B002UM5BXW|4.0|Having worked in the biz mkre than half my life I found myself laughing louder an  louder. I wanted to recant so many passages to colleagues. Great read.
B0090EJR1K|1.0|Absolutely the worst movie. I watched about 30 minutes and just had to stop. Sacha is such a funny guy and I just don't see why he has to resort to adolescent humor.
B009VYF5E2|4.0|I have all 4 seasons of this BBC program.  I will buy season 5 when it becomes available next year.
B0013ANMWY|4.0|As this is an obvious remake of &#34;the body-snatchers&#34; I started watching this film with quite some negative preconceptions.<br />Personally I am not a fan of remakes, especially when the original was a great achievement already. However, Nicole does a great job in this film, I mean there are only a few films where she is not a believable and great actress, additionally together with her talent the film is able to create a very tense and uneasy atmosphere that keeps you at the edge of your seat for quite some time. In the end I have to admit that this film was a very successful adaptation of the original.
B00A6L78YE|5.0|I've been listening to \\"San Francisco\\" and \\"Shuggie\\" for a while now and I love them. Bits and pieces of the songs stay in my head and that is quite pleasant. I think that is the mark of a good song, one that stays with you. As a child of the 60's I appreciate the comparisons to the music of the times, but I like the songs for themselves, not because they remind me of those that have come before. I love their unique way of saying it and playing it. Just digging this album!
B005K01VZS|4.0|All his books are good and make you think about life and the things we value, like family. Good read.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|When I first started reading it, I thought... another Harlequin Romance?  But no.  NOT AT ALL.  Holder and Sky.  Two incredibly powerful characters.  An incredible love story mixed in with some amazing twists and turns that you could almost predict were coming, but then they twist you another direction!  Colleen Hoover is a genius.  I will now go and download Slammed and read it.
B0049MAXQG|5.0|Ive seen the movie before but my friend hadnt so I rented it for him and it was alright even though I dont like movies like this.
B007T2XC7A|3.0|After listening to 'Come Away With Me' this album, 'Little Broken Hearts' is a bit of a departure, lyrically, but not musically. I listened to this quite a few times before I came to realize that these tunes are about abused women, that's what I heard in the lyrics, I don't know if that was deliberate or perhaps something I read into them. Was a bit of a surprise since some of the tunes are catchy.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I really enjoyed this book even though it made me teary eyed at times.  I am glad that love was found  and sad that cancer destroys so much.
B002RI9HUM|5.0|It is amazing how Marian Keyes has taken one of the most serious topics, addiction and rehab, and infused it with humor, fun and a huge roster of amazing characters - while at the same time, dealing with this difficult topic with the utmost sensitivity and insight. We went through a similar situation with a very close family member and despite all the counsellors, therapists, and others we've seen and all the 'serious' books we read, nothing came anywhere near as close in showing me what the world looks like through an addict's eyes. Nothing came anywhere as close in showing me what 'good' therapy can accomplish. I got the book without knowing its subject - I'd enjoyed another of the Keyes' books and wanted a dose of that gentle humor - and would have enjoyed it tremendously even without my personal experience of the subject. But what a bonus to have learned so much!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I really like this show. It has a kinda artsy twist of  the likes of maybe Dexter and Twin Peaks, and it's FREAKY, and sometimes down right scary.
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|I love this series. It's an entertaining & easy read. When I'm reading About Jack Reacher, I always look forward to my reading time.

0393343405|2.0|I kept waiting to enjoy \\"The Swerve\\" but I never got there.<br /><br />This book is best summed-up in one word - boring. There are moments when Greenblatt adds some color and texture to the historical setting, the problem is that the historical period (early 15 century) is also rather boring.<br /><br />It's easy to understand Greenblatt's love of Lucretius' \\"Of the Nature of Things.\\" Lucretius's 2,000 years old philosophy that \\"there is no master plan, no divine architect, no intelligent design\\" fits perfectly with most Harvard professors today. There is no God, no universal meaning of life, and the noblest aspiration a person can have is the pursuit of pleasure. The problem with that philosophy is that it's just as descriptive of Nazism as it is Ivy League academia. Hence, if you're going to credit Lucretius with sparking the Renaissance, you also have to give him some credit for the Holocaust, too.<br /><br />In \\"The Swerve\\" we also learn that Greenblatt's infatuation with Lucretius' poem is partially because it offered a foil to the philosophy of his nutty hypochondriac Jewish mother.  Great for him, still boring for the rest of us.<br /><br />Greenblatt never really offers any evidence that \\"Of the Nature of Things\\" was responsible for sparking the Renaissance and ultimately the modern world we know. You have to conclude that his thesis is more likely just looking for a hook to write a book.
0743454537|4.0|The book was very nicely kept. There was no writing in the book, only a few bends in the pages but it was overall a very good price.
B005VPRFSY|5.0|These provide a lot of fun for the children (and parents) and it is fun to build things together.  The pod is pretty cool, it opens and the droids fit inside.  Fun for a fledgling Star Wars fan.

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is the show for you.  Hands down, brilliant!  The story lines are so rich and beautiful with flawed but admirable characters.
B0001HAISQ|5.0|I have always been a huge fan of the Peter Pan story.  This particular movie, I must say, is the very best version I have ever seen.  My daughters, ages 3 and 5, have just started watching the cartoon, so I figured I would order this movie for them since it is one of my favorites.  I just got it in today and they have already watched it 3 times!  My 9 year old son got to watch it the last time with them and he came looking for me just so he could tell me \\"that was an awesome movie Mom\\" while giving me the thumbs up sign.  The special effects, colors, and acting are all superb.  It does a great job of capturing all the magic and imagination which embodies Peter Pan.  This movie will keep your young children completely spellbound and the adults in the home will love it too!

B003DF4582|4.0|This combination pack contains my favorite movie of all time, A Knight's Tale, and First Knight, a decent though not great King Arthur movie.<br /><br />I will comment simply on the quality and the extras, as you either like the movies or you do not.<br /><br />The video and audio quality is excellent and pulls you into each film. These are not at the same level as newer movies will be in this area (audio tracks are 5.1 instead of 7.1 and are in older formats), but you will not care as these movies were not about bleeding edge technology even when they were released.<br /><br />Having said that, my only gripe with these Blu-Ray releases are the lack of extras on the discs themselves. I have not owned First Knight previously, however A Knight's Tale on DVD had a number of extras including a stellar director's+cast commentary that was hilarious, deleted scenes that added to the film, and other extras that added value for true fans of the film.<br /><br />Because of that, and the lack of extras on First Knight as well, I will dock a single star, as with how much data Blu-Ray discs can hold, it isn't unreasonable to ask for the director's commentary to be present at minimum, even if it has to be compressed a tiny bit to fit. Truly in the majority of cases, all extras from a DVD version should fit on a Blu-Ray version.<br /><br />I do not regret this purchase in the slightest, despite my small griping. These movies have never looked or sounded better, and that is what is most important.
0765325950|5.0|I'm not a critic and I generally don't write reviews, but I had to this time.<br /><br />I have been reading this series since 1990 - literally over 20 years! Each time a new book came out I got it as soon as I found out and figuratively devoured it. Needless to say the anticipation for this book - especially when the release date (albeit rumored) kept changing - was quite high. While Sanderson just isn't the writer that Jordan was and may never be, he was picked and it was Mr. Jordan's wish that he complete the series - so I can respect that. Plus, the story itself and the characters that I've grown to know and love over the last couple decades I would follow anywhere. That being said, I already had pretty high expectations for the book. It was the finale! How would all of these threads get tied off? There have always been so many sub-plots in all of these novels.<br /><br />Without giving any spoilers I can say that I felt totally fulfilled at the end. It was epic, it was dramatic, it was fantastic, it was horrific, it was, in the words of Thom Merrilin, 'Exquisite'.<br /><br />While anybody can argue that some things weren't stressed enough or some characters didn't play as big a part as they could have, that some questions still remained - I disagree. It all worked, it all flowed together and weaving that kind of story, with that many threads and having it all come together so perfectly takes a higher skill with the writing arts than any critic could dream to have. While there may be things to wonder about, you're not left hanging at all on anything. It is after all one of the longest if not the longest single series of books in a given fantasy world setting. It has its own life and always will.<br /><br />If you've read all the previous books then there shouldn't be a question in your mind that you need to get and read this book. If you're only read some of the series then it's well worth catching up and completing the series. Don't skip ahead and try to read out of sequence as it won't make sense. The majesty of certain events just won't click for you. If you've not read any of the series, then get Book 1, [[ASIN:9994302647 The Eye of the World]] and start. It may take you a while, but this epic series is worth it. They are by far better than almost any other book you'll read.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|Having plowed through Riordan's other series, I was so excited to finally get to read this. While it's not as much fun as the previous book in the series, it's still a heck of a good time and a very fast read. Can't wait for Book Four!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Started off a little slow, but picked up.  Lots of twists and turns. Amy is a very interesting and crazy all at the same time.
0688156819|5.0|Artful and hilarious!! I believe this book conveys the essence of Tim Burton's genius!! It is a very short book (a little over 100 pages long) but worth every penny!! I hope Tim Burton publishes more books in the future.

B0095EMOTM|1.0|I open the package, but i got a surprise.  There was no CD on it.  I don't know that is a joke or what?  I'm very dissapointed.  This is the first time it happens to me something like that.
B003G4W4CY|4.0|Great read! Arthur C. Clarke's sense of vision and perception is fully shown here in my view. I found it disturbing to imagine on several levels and some concepts he wrote about future earth have already come to pass. A true sci-fi classic.
B002NLY0V4|5.0|Supernatural never fails to entertain its viewers.  This has been an excellent show since the first season.  Season 5 is no exception.

0316228532|3.0|Having been elevated to another dimension reading Ms Rowling's Harry Potter series, I was disappointed with her adult offering in The Casual Vacancy.  The whole book read more like the smutty offerings of the British tabloid press.  Ok for some maybe, but personally not very entertaining.  I kept hoping the storyline would improve...  Can't believe it made the best seller list.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great continuation from Season 2.  This is a very well written show and great fun to watch.  Sensational and impressive.

B0070Y46UY|4.0|Excellent read. Good lead up to the movie for those who were unaware of this book. Spelling and punctuation does tend to be a problem on most kindle books though.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I recommend this book to readers who enjoy action, futuristic, and romantic novels. This is a 5 star rating because i really enjoyed the romance and how l there was complete determination to stop disaster.
B005LAIISA|5.0|This fourth entry in the Ice Age franchise finds Peaches has become a rebellious teenager as the continents begin breaking up. The first two were pretty faithful paleologically. The last two, not so much. Still, fun entertainment.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is great! I highly recommend getting this game. It is very entertaining. I can't believe it is free.
B003DT19F0|5.0|I bought this for my granddaughter (age 7) who really enjoys it, along with the rest of the Tinker Bell movies. Disney has been a purveyor of fun, family entertainment for decades and this is one of many very good forays. Tinker Bell seems to have become the latest Disney franchise figure. This particular entry finds Tinker Bell captured by a human little girl and taken home. Of course the little girl's father doesn't believe in fairies, and the movie revolves around the father/daughter conflict and Tink's final rescue. Good fun, and not scary (for the most part) for the little ones.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This is a great book I think of it because I'm in middle school this is the best-selling author. Thank you
B006BDHAX0|2.0|Sadly, this games freezes up at unexpected intervals.  Others have noted the same thing, but I have not found a resolution to the problem.  It would be a 5 star game if it were stable.  I would only recommend this if the freezing issue was resolved.  Not a lot of money to purchase this game, but still . . .
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This is a great read. Andy Weir made me laugh out loud like an idiot all the while not being able to put this thing down.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This is by far the best mobile slender app. Also, it's not just pictures like all the  other ones. If you like the original slender you'll love this game. I play it on my kindle fire hd.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|Frankly, I was expecting much much more in this account.  The idea of a life after death has always intrigued me; however, Dr. Alexander's view was very bland.  Since it is non-fiction, I think that the idea of an afterlife is probably better portrayed as a &#34;fictional accounting&#34;, since the author can use artistic license to build up to the event in question.  It was boring to say the least.  I know people that claim they have actually experienced the reappearance of family members from time to time and their version of this was more exciting than the version Dr. Alexander wrote about.  A lot of theories and little description as to the events in question, which if true would have been spine tingling.  His interpretations were not.  Very disappointed.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|John Grisham is a master at using the law to illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of our legal system. Highly recommended!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Awesome!! Addictive!!!!! I highly recommend !!! I lead a sedentary life due to a handicap and have a lot of time. Get tired of watching tv.  Now I have to decide between this game and reading.
B009O2XY12|2.0|Just isn't a good game. Its more for a five or six year old child to play verses an adult.
B0067Q42BY|3.0|I wouldn't want to try to play the higher levels with the helps. Tutorial only goes SO far and doesn't explain what different tiles do/match in higher levels.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This is scary but fun! Lots of great effects. Fun puzzles, good graphics. Playing with my niece and she has all the answers.
0399215980|3.0|Your product description does not contain the crucial information that this is a tiny book.  I bought this for storytime use and of course, it's not usable with a group of children at this size.  Mark me down as very disappointed.
B002K8BJAK|5.0|Great show in an acoustic version of recent and old success of this band, that is the greatest hard rock band ever to exist on Earth.
B0060MYM7O|1.0|This show is nothing but a soft core porn series trying really hard to be a Lord of the Rings wannabe and falling flat on it's face as it laughably attempts to be so.<br /><br />Do yourself a favour and rewatch Lord of the Rings, you'll be much more happier and intelligent for doing so.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I just love action in my books and this had plenty of it.  Makes me want to read more of Tom's thrillers..

B00571F26Y|4.0|Not for every body, but worthy of anyones consideration. This book makes no promises. If you do choose to give wheat-free eating a try, that is not as hard as you think.<br /><br />Doctor Davis shows that wheat is the reason for our nationwide obesity epidemic. As an organic gardener the story of unchecked genetic tinkering is intriguing. This is the story and history of wheat as a staple in our diet. It is also the story of agribusiness turning what once was a wholesome food into a frankenfood.

B008FYZIVY|5.0|What the heck is all this talk about Downton Abbey? If you are late to the party, or you've missed a few episodes, this is a &#34;must watch&#34; This CD set is perfect for the long dry spell between season 2 and 3. Faithful watchers of Downton Abbey will appreciate this set as a review. There are so many details in this rich drama, even regular watchers will enjoy adding these first two seasons to their collection.
0988262592|5.0|I honestly feel that anybody that works in any capacity in information technology should read this book. That includes development, security, and all other disciplines. It has been a long time since I have read an IT book that so effortlessly and enjoyably presented ideas that really sink home. Gene Kim, George Spafford, and Kevin Behr have done a excellent job at providing a very consumable introduction to how DevOps can make you life in business easier. On top of that, it's a great story which is well told.<br /><br />Now I need to go back and read it again with my notepad handy.
1441308660|5.0|Fits good and the price was exactly what we needed.  Some people charge way to much for something so simple.

0321543726|4.0|I am in my 2nd term of a C++ string of classes and the first couple of chapters of this book still shines light on why the language does what it does. For the budding programmer, this book will seem tough but if you work through it, you should be able to succeed. I would imagine that even for an experience coder, they will be able to pick up some tidbits of good information in using C++. Besides, how can you go wrong using a book written by the language's creator!
B00AC8ZJPQ|5.0|This is a great intro into the live action world for Halo. It was a little slow to get started but it was a good intro into the story if you haven't been playing the games at all. The action scenes were fantastic and the guns and the energy sword all looked perfect. I wish there would have been a few grunts running around with plasma grenades in their hands and yelling like in the games. I always liked them, but it was definitely worth watching. I hope this helps to generate some interest in the studios so that they will keep the live action Halo dream alive. I can't believe nobody has stayed on board to produce one. I'm glad Microsoft saw the potential and invested the money in making this.
0765325950|1.0|I thought long and hard before joining the Kindle protest.  It's not a matter of price.  I would have gladly paid the hardback price in spite of the fact that TOR already charged me $2.99 for the Prologue on Kindle.  It's a matter of fairness.  Audio book listeners have it, so why not e-book readers.  I am the customer.  I should be able to take advantage of Kindle's flexibility with font sizes and superior ergonomics.  Instead, I have been penalized with the ugly choice of struggling with obsolete technology or waiting an additional 3 months.  Well, I'm struggling with the fine print but I'll wait until the Kindle version is released before updating my rating to reflect my opinion of the story.
B00992CF6W|3.0|its a great game and i would recomend it to everyone, but the app has a few bugs that need to be fixed. I hope you don't need to blow anything up...
B002BBJ52U|4.0|Really Funny Movie. I love how the characters evolve throughout the movie and seeing the true comedy that comes from it.

B006MW3UZW|4.0|The quality of the video was excellent, but I was surprised to learn that I could not fast forward or re-wind, nor use closed caption.  This is an Amazon glitch in its instant videos.  I therfore requested a refund on my purchase with a confirming e-mail. My request was granted, but I have not yet received the confirming e-mail.
B000001Y5X|5.0|This isn't a greatly produced album, but i'd say its better than Golden Age and everything after it.  Bass lines like in Dope Hat and catchy choruses like in Cake and Sodomy will be stuck in your head all day.
B000MD9UJC|5.0|Great upgrade for the money. A lot brighter than the old halogen for sure. Will it last 25 hours..probably not. Is it 30 lumens? Well I have a flash light that is 10 lumens and one that is 20 lumens and this one is brighter than those. I had a junk mini mag light that had died from battery acid corrosion. Decided to upgrade to the LED while i was at it. I would consider the light to be trash or &#34;free&#34; so upgrading was just the cost of the conversion kit. Now if you bought the mini mag light and wanting to do this conversion, DON&#34;T do it!!! If you factor in the cost of the flashlight and the kit, then for the same or similar price could buy you a much much nicer flash light. but if you had a beat up flash light with a dead bulb, why not go for it? There are other kits out there that advertise they put out more lumens but with a shorter life. I did not get those because I also have lights that are 110 lumens 120 lumens and 220 lumens. I dont need another flash light that is 50-60 lumens but only lasts a few hours. Sure it would be a middle of the road flashlight but it would be a waste. This flash light conversion is awesome. Now the flash light is brighter and last even longer.
B00A6SZS2Q|5.0|The whole layout and concept of the album was unexpected by fans but yet still fascinating.  I don't know how they managed to pull it off but they easily did.
B007BVOEPI|4.0|A few people mentioned this series to my wife and I. When we finally watched the first episode we were hooked. It's artistic, sexy and full of adventure as well as mystery. I would compare it with Lord of the Rings crossed with True Blood.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Brilliant just brilliant AMAZING book stands out of all the books ever known to man kind<br />Sad but AMAZING!!Susan Collins is brilliant
B0028RXXE8|5.0|I have enjoyed watching Rome more than once. When I received the package it looked brand new and has no defects. I would recommend this movie to any adults who enjoy action, romance and history.
0525953728|3.0|The book--and the story--are fascinating.  If you're not interested in his background, skip ahead to the story of the planning and execution of the Bin Laden assassination.  Skip the last few pages ... he starts taking cheap shots and stops looking a hero and more like a whiner.  Really ruined the book for me.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Cant beat this price! The greatest trilogy of the century is now available, on Blu Ray with tons of bonus features and a color picture book AND the ultra violet copy for only 30 dollars. I had to pinch myself a few times to make sure I wasn't dreaming.
B005LAII1C|5.0|I had ordered everything so close to Christmas time with fear some items may not arrive.  This was one of the first to arrive, perfect condition, so issues at all.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Great movie, and four discs of bonus features and ultra violet copies make this an excellent buy. Would recommend to anyone who even remotely liked the movie.
B0015DROBO|4.0|The movie was good, but you just knew the characters were so much more interesting.  The book definitely filled in the gaps.
0061148512|5.0|I am a true fantasy and science fiction fan, and I reluctantly purchased this book for my last required literature class (which I put off until my last quarter of my senior year of college).<br /><br />I opened this book, and got immediately sucked in. The author has a way of making the main character extremely relatable, to the point where it just sucks you in and before you know it....well, I won't be giving you any spoilers.<br /><br />Get this book. It's worth a read!
B000SXMNI6|5.0|A great classic rock album. This remix is as good as it gets. Music that is over 25 years old and sounds this good is a treat.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Truly a beautiful read.  The story and characters are so rich you can almost touch and smell the circus. This would make an incredible movie. Kudos to Erin Morganstern for her excellent writing. Love, love, love the night circus.
B00004X10B|5.0|Big Bag! It's hard to say how many pockets and places there are to use in this labyrinth of a case. I fit one Canon 2Ti body, 7 lenses, flash, tripod head, and meters snugly and securely amidst the foam padding, which can be rearranged. The front and cover pockets are divided into all kinds of places for batteries, data cards, remote cables, etc. The back of the case can hold an iPad in one slot and a notebook in another. Mainly, this case offers choices for how you store your gear, how each pocket closes-zippers, clips, or velcro, so that it's easily personalized. Has shoulder strap, body handle, and tripod straps. This is the bag I use when I need everything for an expected shoot. If flying, I can take alI I might need and it's a carry-on.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Once you start reading the book, you just cannot put it down, intriguing exciting and very inspiring.  Life does exist with great love
B0016CO2HS|5.0|This album is one of the reasons that the RS became huge back in the 60's & 70's.  After 40-50 years, I'm amazed at how great these songs sound today, including a good variety as well.  Having recently read Keith Richards book &#34;Life&#34;, I decided to go back and check out some of the sounds that Keith referred to, including the influence that Charlie Watts had with his jazz background and delayed beat that made the Stones sound unique.  As a kid in the 60's, with my brothers and friends, we tended to focus more on the RS, Hendrix, and the Doors, rather than the Beatles.  We still liked listening to the Beatles, but there was a greater attraction to the RS.  Back in 1968, we saw the Stones at the Hollywood Bowl for $5 per seat, and that was within 100 feet of the stage.  So hearing this cd brought back great memories.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|game is so cool I love playing it when my dad drives me to school In his lamborghini. this game is fun must get it
B007SOQBCM|3.0|I've been an avid fan of pro League of Legends streams for about half a year now and I was quite delighted to find out that their was a Twitch TV app for the Kindle Fire.<br /><br />Let's begin with the pros:<br />-Allows access to your favorite streams wherever an internet connection, (and you don't have to watch it on a tiny smart phone!)<br />-Includes all streams from all major games, (LoL, DotA, SC2), and minor games, (Halo, CoD, speedruns).<br />-Interface is intuitive and does not require an Einstein capacity intellect to learn.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Most streams can only be viewed in 480p.<br />-Streams sometimes fail to load; requires app restart to load it properly.<br />-Missing A LOT of the features from the PC website such as log in privileges, access to VODS, chat, etc. This was definitely my chief complaint regarding the app.<br /><br />Overall, this app is a must have for stream junkies, such as myself. Whether you're at home on the toilet or sitting in the airport, you won't miss any pro gaming action! However, I felt inclined to reduce the rating to 3 stars due to the stated gripes above. With all that said, job well done, Twitch TV; here's to hoping you continue to improve upon this app.
B005I4JG80|5.0|this is a fun and insightful book! i would buy it for every mother and mother-to-be i know!<br />there is way too much stress and fear surrounding motherhood these days, this is a WONDERFUL antidote!

0786891416|4.0|Castle wraps his story around NYPD homicide detective, Nikki Heat and her working as well as personnel relationship with journalist, Jameson Rook. Doing research for a new article, Rook rides along with Heat to investigate a New York city murder of a real estate tycoon.<br />Along with the gruesome events involved in the murder, Castle manages to bring a bit of twisted humor and lustful passion between the characters. I found this to be an entertaining and enjoyable read.
B006JPS1OM|5.0|An addicting mystery/hidden object game that allows you to take your time to look for clues and hidden objects. There isn't a limit on how many hints you can use, but you do have to wait about 1 minute for the hint button to recharge.  I really enjoyed playing this game.
0345536886|3.0|Grisham takes us out of his usual deep south setting to Chicago for another legal story. This time to the world of litigators. His main characters, Oscar, Wally and David are one tiny step above common con-artists, called street lawyers or ambulance chasers.<br />Grisham delves into the shady side of \\"bad drug\\" lawsuits including mass tort, which can include thousands of clients. Basically his primary plot is little guy vs big corporation. Another point he addresses is that not every lawyer is automatically a \\"Perry Mason\\" trial lawyer or litigator just because he passed the bar.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is really realistic and my toddler loves it. I find myself enjoying it with him. It would be nice if clothes and tack were more realistic as well
B000VLE3GA|5.0|There is nothing that I can say bad about this album. Whole Lotta Love, Dazed and Confused, In My Time of Dying, Kashmir, and No Quarter are incredible anthems that transcend time. For Your Life, Achille's Last Stand, and the rest of the songs sound fresh, slightly different, slightly improved in some ways. This is a great collection of the best of Led Zeppelin. A good start for anyone who wants to find out what the greatest band in the world sounds like!
B0065GC0BA|5.0|I keep thinking of all the accolades I could heap on this book but honestly, there isn't a way to describe how haunting this book is. So read it....you won't be able to put it down,,,,It's a miserable premise, and at first you feel a little manipulated as a reader.... but despite you're protests it pulls you in right away and you will not want it to end. You will get so connected to the characters and they will come off the page and make you feel emotions you haven't felt in years. I haven't cried that hard over an ending since I was a teenager reading &#34;Gone With the Wind&#34;. Regardless of how you feel about the whole issue of assisted suicide, &#34;Me Before You&#34; is a story that will stay with you long after the last page is read.
B004UID2LC|1.0|App wants to know too much about what you are doing on your phone. Plus it only does 64kbps mp3s.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I will not give the story away but this could be a very sad tale....but it is a genuine love story complete with the joy and the tears.  I generally read thrillers but I was open minded enough to believe a reviewer who said it was wonderful and it certainly was...sorry it ended.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|I love it, love it, but then I also love the series. Listening to the CD is like seeing them on the show. If you like Nashville or Good music you will like this CD.
B008XG1X18|4.0|Works just as described. UI is a little bit awkward sometimes, but that's not a huge problem. Easier than using the built in browser.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|it's not free on the kindle fire HD for some reason. I don't really understand why. It was free on my original kindle fire, and it's free on my android phone, but not the kindle fire HD. Sad because I LOVE playing this game.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|this game was GREAT! perfect balance of mini games woven in. it was challenging, but not so hard it was frustrating.  It was a nice long game and I definitely would have paid much more and still been happy. I've. played a lot of similar games lately and way too many have an ending that is confusing or just way off. this ending made sense and didn't feel like it was just suddenly dropped. Good job Big Fish Games! I played it on my Fire and had zero technical problems.  please, please hurry with the sequel.
1609611543|5.0|This book was recommended by a very health conscious friend of mine. Not only has it changed my life, it changed the lives of everyone I lent it to.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|If you like temple run, you will love this game! It is much faster and much more difficult than temple run. I know both games quite well. I AM IN THE TOP 3%  of temple runs scoring.. IF YOU THINK TEMPLE RUN IS DIFFICULT, IT IS CHILD'S PLAY COMPARED TO THIS GAME. YOU WILL NEED TO BE VERY FAST WITH HAND, EYE COORDINATION. GET THIS GAME. IT  IS AWESOME!!!!!!! I LOVE THIS FAST AND SMART GAME,!!!!!!
B005VZQ95O|5.0|Good group of classic Pink Floyd songs!  All of them were songs to enjoy over and over again. It's hard to decide on a favorite.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|Eclectic mix of songs. First album I purchased online and it was definately worth the $5 bucks. I listent to it at least once a day.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is amazing. its fun to pass time and its worth it. I play it all the time and love every game on there. old and new.

B00AJRQLTI|5.0|The music from the movie is great and sounds wonderful! I've enjoyed listening to it from the cloud. Purchasing the audio from Amazon was a convenient way to get the music.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|This fun app allows for lots of creativity.  Kids can create new hairstyles on different people multiple times.  They seem to never get tired of it.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is my favorite book, but I warn you it will make you cry. I was sitting on my bed bawling and cursing the writer but it's an amazing book
B006TF6WAM|5.0|I loved this book!  - it was made up of such ordinary people, with such dull lives and yet captures the essence of human fraility and compassion.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I can't believe how addicting this game is. I love to figure out how to solve each and every stage. FUN.
B005ZTFPFQ|4.0|Got this, but ultimately upgraded to full Atari kit.  So much fun and reminds me of times soooo long ago!  Very fun!!!
B00886XQO0|5.0|Audio quality is very good (not pristine, but very good for the price range).<br />It should come with the TalkBack cable for those that hate wireless.<br />Have to reboot from time to time (every few days) as it loses a function with Mass Effect 3 (the narrator's voice in multiplayer can no longer be heard).
B005LAIGN2|5.0|There were so many people who told me this movie was so good. I had to go buy it and see for myself yes they are right this is a very good movie and educational
B004498KPU|5.0|Shows alot of different videos and also show's his journey<br />I recommend Michael Jackson's Vision to anyone who loves Michael Jackson
B005PK553C|5.0|What odd, interesting, dark, thoughtful writing.  I could not stop watching it.  I could never guess what will come next.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Reality as shape-shifter.  Wonderful effects--some younger children might be a bit frightened.  Sucks the viewer into a dream-like surreal existence.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Loved it!!!!! The writing and storyline twists were exceptional.  I loved season 1 but the stories keep getting better and better.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I wish I could do half a star so I can give it 4 and a half.  and it is fun
B004R13U6Y|1.0|DON&#34;T GET THIS! It crashed twice within 5 minutes. In fact, it crashed on the initial open!<br />If I could return this app i would!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This is an addictive game.  You keep trying to beat each level even if you have to start over.  Great for helping concentration
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|This came in amazing time. It was exactly what I expected and I would recommend ordering this cd to anyone!
1849163855|5.0|Well-crafted novel. Refreshing to get a story out of the mainstream. Have bought May's next one : The Lewis Man.
B008C20TDG|5.0|Not only have I lost weight on this plan, but my allergies, sinus problems, headaches and digestive issues have all gone away! I don't have trouble waking up in the morning now because I don't feel crappy anymore! I've even convinced a few coworkers to try it out too! I feel great! It's not a diet! It's a new way to live your life! (PS: my cats are now on a whole food, no grain diet and they are also showing signs of improved health! Less shedding, shinier fur, less tummy trouble, and a smaller gut!) Everyone's happy at my house!
0316067938|5.0|The book came a little later than it had stated, which was fine, I was in no hurry. The book was in great condition, looked as if it had never been read!
B0086DBE62|5.0|The plot is good. The visuals and colors are great. I was about to buy it on blu-ray but it's on Netflix
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|This was a big surprise for me, and wish I had seen it in theaters. The plot development was fantastic, starting with laying out the basics of how this world works, then introducing a problem, then changing the path yet keeping it in key half way through. The acting, directing, sound design were all incredible. My only gripe was with the blue flare being a bit overdone in a few scenes.
1451620829|5.0|This book is awesome!! If your a KISS fan this is a must read. Don't even think about it. Buy it!! I would put it right up there with the The Dirt from Motley Crue. It has so many great stories that will blow your mind. It's good to hear the stories of KISS from the other side of the coin besides how Gene and Paul tell it. This is my favorite KISS book that I have read. And I have read pretty much all of the autobiography's and story books on KISS. You will not be disappointed.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it is so fun I think any age could play this game and never get board I love it so much
0765325950|5.0|I really enjoyed this last book in the series.  I felt that it was wrapped up fairly nicely.  Did leave a few loose ends that I had questions about and would have liked to have answered but overall was pleased with the book.  It's sad to see this series end after so long of reading them but yet it was also good to see all my favorite characters in their last stand that we have been patiently awaiting.  I'd recommend this series to readers looking for a lengthy epic series to read.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|It's ok things could be better but over all pretty fun game.<br />Enjoyed playing around with it I like that I get to name my horses.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|As previous episodes, this one does not disappoint. What a wonderful series - quality television. Better than anything on today!
B00846REIS|4.0|The book was good, and the writing was passionate.  The story left a little to be desired, I mean, there wasn't a big climactic event at all.  A lot of vividly described sex scenes like in 50 Shades of Gray, but not quite as much excitement otherwise.<br /><br />I am currently reading the sequel so clearly it was somewhat entertaining.  I recommend it.
B002PJN59M|5.0|Saw this movie in the theatre  with my mom and my sister when it first came out.  Wow the intimate scenes sure inspired mom and my sister!  I've been watching the findal season of Merlin (Bummer) and thought about this movie and wanted to add it to my library.  Thanks!
0802473156|5.0|Just a must have book!<br />Love is like a plant, if you don't feed it and care for it it will die. Highly suggest you read.
0321344758|5.0|Outstanding content, advice, and examples.  I'm using this as the guide for redesigning my company's website.  I'd recommend this to anyone who wants to make their website easier to use.
B009H442DG|5.0|I really enjoy listening to this over and over!  Glad I got it even if it was after the holidays.
B0097NGUJG|3.0|very different easy to listen to while relaxing. I have listened a few times and like it pretty well a
B006LSZECO|4.0|The points of view and pacing of the novel are excellent.  The development of both characters is done perfectly...first book I took to work to read at lunchtime in a very long time.
B000065R29|5.0|the product arrived in excellent condition, at the indicated time and was to my liking, thank you very much. Arturo
0609610570|4.0|This book is all about business, but as I read it I couldn't help but see it through a sports filter. What's your sport? I've heard it in football, baseball, tennis, basketball - you have to execute well. I've experienced it in my own primary sport of racquetball. I've noted with surprise after my shot goes astray, \\"That's not how I saw it in my head. I need to execute!\\" Larry Bossidy's philosophy is based primarily on his experience at GE with the famous Jack Welch. Planning is critical to Leadership, but this book emphasizes that success hinges on a leader actively engaged in implementation. The leader has to want success enough to get her/his hands dirty and work for it. This book draws a clear distinction between recommending successful execution and discouraging micromanagement. Knowledge, clear communication, and effective follow through are the prescription for success. This book is thorough, detailed, and the real life examples throughout are very interesting. Well worth the read. I continue pursuit of 100% excellent execution in my racquetball game.\\"
B00APUYWYA|5.0|it was entertaining. I laughed out loud a few times. The singing was wonderful. I watched a few of the singing parts more than once.
B00786XVOG|5.0|I absolutely loved this CD/DVD!  If you &#34;like&#34; Yanni...you will &#34;love&#34; this!!!  I was fortunate to actually see his live performance of this when he was touring here in Austin, Texas and I loved it.  That is why I wanted to get this to remember his fantastic performance!!!  When I watch the DVD it transforms me back to his live performance.  One can just feel how Yanni &#34;feels&#34; his performance.  It is like a romantic encounter with his music!!!
B008TRUDAS|5.0|On a whim, I read Colleen's book Hopeless and loved it. I resolved to read all of the author's other books right away. I learned that Slammed was her debut book, so I bought it. I fell in love with this book as well. Lake and Will were such believable characters, and their feelings for each other were portrayed to the reader very well. You could really feel the emotions and heartache throughout the story. The end was really amazing, and I could not wait to read more of Lake and Will's story. If you are looking for a clean, romantic YA book that leaves you wanting to hear more of the characters' amazing story, get this book!
B001U3Y5XE|4.0|Very cute game for my Lego loving 5 yr old grandson.  Everyone enjoys playing plus he also uses the pieces to build &#34;whatever&#34; when not actually playing the game.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I can say that this book will probably be read over and over and over again by me.<br /><br />I laughed, I cried, I fell in love. Once I started reading Hopeless, I could not put it down! Yes, some of the subject material is a bit delicate, but the twists and turns were so amazing and well thought out. I don't think I have ever cried and laughed so much in one sitting. If you are looking for a book that will suck you in and pull at your heart strings, and even leave you a little hot and bothered... Hopeless is for you.
0316228532|3.0|So, I knew this was meant to be a more serious, adult book, and I didn't compare it to Harry Potter's success. I read it like I would any other book, not judging it for what the author has written before. Unfortunately, it's a hit and miss for me.<br /><br />My main issue with the book is, the number of characters and sub-plots. It took me at least a few days to get through the first half. However, I understand where the author's coming from, because this is a story about a small town, where everyone knows everyone else, and there would be a lot of small town drama going on. Still, if you're used to seeing a simpler story, with only a few central characters, it's a little jarring. One other issue I had is, some of the way it's written. J.K. Rowling is writing an adult book, I understand that. But, adult doesn't have to mean cursing on every other page, and throwing mature content in just because you can. I'm not saying she abuses the adult content, but it can get a little old when you see a curse word at least twenty times in just one part of the book. One last complaint is for all the build up and potential it had, the ending was extremely abrupt.<br /><br />Well, now that I got the bad stuff out of the way, let's talk about the good stuff. The good news is, about halfway through, you do get used to the style the book is written in, where it jumps from one group of characters to the next. Once you get to know them and their motivations, the characterization and description really shine through. I enjoy books that give you a few different character perspectives, so you can better understand what they're going through. This is used effectively with the character of Krystal Weedon, and why I feel true sympathy when both she and her little brother die at the end, and how it's put in a realistic light of how it's handled. One other positive thing is, once you get invested in the characters, it does get interesting, and I got into certain aspects of the story.<br /><br />All in all, if you can get through the first half of the book, it does pick up in the second half. I just wish there wasn't so many sub-plots and more chances to expand on certain aspects of the story. But, I'd say it was a worthwhile read.
B0015DWLD0|1.0|This was the read for our book club this month.  Although this book is tooted to be an allegory, it lacks in story, characterization, and morality.
0385504225|5.0|I loved this book!  It was really fun to see U.S. history get the Da Vinci Code treatment.  I enjoyed learning a new perspective on American history.  Having visited Washington, D.C. before, I was able to picture a lot of the scenes.  I look forward to returning to D.C. after gaining the Lost Symbol perspective on many of the sights.  Fans of the Da Vinci Code will enjoy this book.
B000W1V5VU|5.0|Saw this on TV, but my wife HAD to have this one so she could watch it whenever she wanted.
B0006VBFM0|4.0|I like the watch and will be taking to Florida with me and at that time I will be wearing it.  I did have a hard time getting it to stop running, but finally did.  It is cute, however and looks like a Florida thing.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I read all the time and a variety of different authors.  I read both Slammed and Point of Retreat and really enjoyed both of them, so I decided to read Hopeless.  Needless to say I was pleasantly surprised.  The characters were very relatable and it's a great story of love and loss.  I couldn't put the book down, and read it within 24 hours.  I have already recommended to all of my coworkers!
B00A9X9ORI|3.0|I am a fan of Sci-Fi movies that include time travel.  Looper is definitely entertaining to watch, but some parts of the plot seem very predictable.  I also thought that some of the scenes on the farm were too long.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|This book was very detailed and interesting.  I very much liked the historical content.  I didn't know much about this horrible war and how the people suffered.  So many people had to live in deplorable circumstances, very little food, and the food was not good.  Some of the rich had to learn how to do without.  The lives and loves of several of the characters was interesting and held my interest until the very end.  The soldiers were not always led by men who cared whether the men under them had food, or lived.
0765325950|5.0|It was a fitting ennd to this age.  Hope it will continue with a follow up book as planned before RJ`s death
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|I love the story it's so entertaining . Love it.every time I finish it I get the next one wow
0399160450|3.0|Threat Vector is typical Tom Clancy, good read.  The younger Ryan is getting more and more fleshed out.  Woud recommend to others
B002UM5BXW|3.0|Good, not great.  I spent a lot of time looking for translations. Probably reads better for an avid foodie.  I also got lost, or just did not care to keep track of some of the other people in the stories.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Super game to play very challenge fun my kids loved this game we played non stop I will raccomented to my friend.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Great book from the perspective of a stranded astronaut, you will quickly fall in love with Mark as he fights to survive in a not so distant future.  Loved the simple style of writing mixed with the complex science that Mark attempts to deal with his different situations surviving life on mars.

B00A80SHFM|3.0|After having loved the theater version soundtrack for 20+ years, I knew that I would probably be a little disappointed in the cinematic soundtrack.  However, I was even more disappointed than I thought I would be.  I understand that they recorded these tracks live and in one take as they were being acted out, but they were soooo rough.  Hugh Jackman, who I thought would do well, only did so-so.  His voice seemed too nasally, especially on Valjean's Soliloquy.  I think he would've been capable of a full rich tone, he just (for some reason) didn't choose to do it.  Amanda Seyfried, on a Heart Full of Love.....PLEASE hold a note at the end of a phrase...quit chopping them off and PLEASE lose that awful vibrato.  She sounded like she was a 13 year old singing on stage for the first time and she was so scared her voice was shaking.  I know she's capable of better musical quality than that too.  Russell Crowe was bad in spots.  I think his voice has potential and every once in awhile it would come out, but throughout most of the CD he was very flat, not necessarily in pitch, but in emotion.  Anne Hathaway did brilliant and so did Eddie Redmayne.  Both gave performances that lived up to the theater versions.  Of course, Samantha Barks did well and Isabelle Allen's version of Castle on a Cloud reminded me of the original theater version of the song.  When listening to The Bishop, I told my son...&#34;the guy playing the Bishop sounds a lot like the original Valjean in the theater production&#34;  I was pleasantly surprised to see that it was, in fact, Colm Wilkinson.  He did fantastic, as always, even in a smaller part!  I was disappointed that Do You Hear the People Sing and A Little Fall of Rain weren't included in this Highlights CD, especially since they're 2 of my favorite tracks from the original.  I had this CD for about a week and then I finally got to see the movie and I have to admit that seeing the film with these CD tracks incorporated in, did make some of the songs more enjoyable.  For someone who's not familiar with the theater versions of these songs, I think they will be satisfied and happy with this CD.  For the rest of us....a bit of a disappointment.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|I'm around horses quite a bit and this game seems as good as it gets.  Very realistic.  I find it pretty addicting.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|One of the most refreshingly original books I have read in a very long time. I cannot wait to read the next book.
B006ZN7KMM|5.0|Uno de los libros mas interesantes que he leido, se los recomiendo<br /> . One the more interesting book I never read.
B0089K7DGW|5.0|A great series that can be watched many times if you're a fan of genre as we are. This was ordered and given as a gift along with the second season. The recipients are now hooked and can't wait for Season 3 to be available!
B005LAJ1HW|5.0|A great series that can be watched many times if you're a fan of genre as we are. This was ordered and given as a gift along with the first season. The recipients are now hooked and can't wait for Season 3 to be available!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a really fun game. I love horses, I have to but am not able to ride. This is like my dream in a game. Love it!
B007JWKLMO|4.0|Martin Scorsese has always done well with music films and excels at it.A great bio of George's life story with interviews of the people who were closest to him and knew him best.My only criticism is that there were not enough full length clips of songs performed by George.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|So well written and entertaining. Acting was  also superb. It really brings that period of history to life. Loved it!
B00AC8ZJ6K|4.0|Even though I did not watch the movie until AFTER I had already played most of the game, I really enjoyed seeing the storyline that led into the game. The acting was much better than I expected, and I was impressed by the movie's consistency with and sharp presentation of the enemies and Master Chief. 343 Industries has really taken Halo 4 to the next level of total package gaming.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|got the audible version, my daugher loved it, could not stop reading it!!!!<br />Absolutely very well written, recommend to anyone who anyone who has children in middle school.  A nmust read!
B006LSZECO|4.0|This was a very unique page-turner book. I enjoyed it very much and would recommend it to anyone that enjoys mystery novels.
B0084U0IEG|4.0|Sweet Tooth: A Novel<br />Good story that was easy to read and enjoyable.  The writing style is good and keeps your attention.
B003L77GH4|5.0|Came packaged brand new still wrapped in plastic. All disk work perfectly, no skips at all.<br />Love this show. Even after so much seemed to happen in the first season, the second is still action packed as well.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|Came brand new still in plastic wrap. All disk work perfectly with no scratches,etc.<br />Love this show. Even on the 3rd season I am hooked to where I can't just watch one episode and turn it off.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|I realize that these books are supposed to be about the &#34;land&#34; versus individual characters. But come on. Stop killing people for the sake of killing people. If I hadn't committed so much time the books already then I wouldn't bother with the next one.<br /><br />Shock value for shock value is really absurd.<br /><br />Plus have a little more closure in between books.
B002N44XSG|5.0|This book is written by the best author in the world and its a best selling book for Greek mythology fans
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I have been on Facebook for very long time and I truly enjoy the friends Connecting with your Friends and family. The games on Facebook are good too, I am so glad that I have set up my Facebook account.
B007NQVRNS|4.0|Frequency is a very touching story about the relationship between a man and his son and how they save each others lives.  It is also a tale about the problems with changing the past.  How the past can affect the future.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|So much fun I could not stop playing fun for all ages you will enjoy it just get it !!!!! (:
B00AE2I4B6|1.0|I fell asleep on this movie within the first 30 minutes, I'm not exaggerating, I had to watch this more than once in order to watch the entire movie. The acting was bad (not as bad as Channing Tatum's), the dancing was alright, the last 10 minutes of the movie has the best dancing, but the rest of it was not worth watching.
B005HSL626|4.0|Been playing FRUIT NINJA on my Nokia Astound for almost 2 years, and while it works great on the small screen, I've been wondering what it would be like to play it on a bigger device (no, I haven't gotten around to playing it on the XBox 360 Kinect. Gotta get a Kinect first!).<br />Anyway, my wife gave me a Kindle Fire for Xmas and one of the first games I installed on it is Fruit Ninja. I expected big things, and it definitely delivers! As smooth as it is on my phone, it plays even smoother on the Kindle Fire!  The increased screen size really makes a difference with this game! In addition, everything I enjoyed about Fruit Ninja on my Nokia has made a seamless transition to the KF.  Great squishey sounds, cartooney graphics, non-stop intense touchscreen swipe action and awesome TRUE fruit facts make this game a winner STILL!  In fact, I've now got my wife and 20 year old daughter hooked on Fruit Ninja! They both downloaded the game on their respective Kindles yesterday!<br />Now if all the digital fruit slicing I've been doing with this game could help me get over this nasty cold I've got, FRUIT NINJA would be the PERFECT app!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|all or good but world at arms not so good! the movies are really good wish i had more time to watch them.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was definitely my favorite out of the three. This book just ties everything together a way I could never imagine.All my friends and peers warned me that this book was incredibly hard to get into, I strongly disagree. Read on!!!
B0083Z614S|5.0|I like this book a lot I think it is a very very interesting book I think everybody my age should read it!!!!!!!!!!!
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|It does not let me tap when I'd like to and I have other angry birds games that work perfectly fine
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|This is a great app, but should make more free colors to add. They should also make a pass and play version .
B0086700CM|4.0|This is a great app, but it is not as addicting as they say. They should add more characters and different temples you can try to escape from. Get this app.
B003L77GRY|5.0|Another fine season of Dexter. Julia Stiles is a great addition to the season, and the story line for the season works pretty well. Of course - if you are a Dexter fan at all, you know that you don't need to read my opinion to buy this.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|How come a 70-year-old grandmother can't overcome the most basic obstacles and get those pigs??  I knew my grandchildren were special, but I didn't realize how much their talents surprassed my own!
B005QJZ5FA|4.0|Cool, retro, and unique. One of the more unique sounds in popular music, with a unique voice and etehereal songwriting. And, BTW, this female writes music; not just a singer that someone decided to put in front of a band. Very talented woman, she is. Highly recommended for everyone on planet Earth.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Excellent for grab and save notes, easy copy/paste save, quick and straight forward to use. I don't like that it pops up a thing asking if you want to enable location based stuff every time you start a new note. No. I don't want to broadcast my location, thanks. Stop asking.<br /><br />But that said, it's a minor thing and there may be away to shut it of that idk... it's now taking abilities are pretty good
B008JFLWLE|4.0|Really interesting app and it works like the app description says.  It takes some practice and learning how/where to write the numbers and signs but it is very cool.  It can be irritating sometimes, when you can't get the data input where you want it or it misinterprets your input and throws seemingly random data on the screen.  Once you get the hang of it, it becomes easier.  This won't replace your real calculator for speed when doing longer calculations but it is still somewhat useful, and fun.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|I find this music hypnotic.  Only problem is...each song is short  - some only a minute.  But the music and the poetry are fabulous.
B0095G5AFU|5.0|I have a note apps on my Kindle Fire that works rather well and all my posted topics are saved as listings in a file. Every day I read or text to speech or listen to audio books when I come across interesting words or words that I can puzzle out based on the sentance but I am not sure of it true meaning I collect them and put them in my vocabulary file. I also collect quotes from books, videos documentaries and movies, over time I had to open to many files to find what I wanted or to add new information to those ongoing files. There had to be a better way to keep track of all this information and my personal thoughts so I started looking and found Notebooks (free version) downloaded it, loved it so I bought Notebooks Pro the price was right. On checking my old note app I noticed my newest vocabulary word was missing (bummer), I transfered the rest of my words to the Pro created a vocabulary book, quotes book, personal book with more to go. It took me very little time to figure out how to navigate the Notebooks Pro add books, title them, choose the texture of the book cover enough to get started. There is more to learn about this apps and I'm well on my way, I can type in, write free hand, choose the script I want, color of the background and print what else can I ask for but most of all every topic has it own book, Nice!! You can't go wrong with this one it also has a search function.
0670024813|5.0|Scholarly but written for the layperson.  A healthy life is easily achievable with simple changes in lifestyle.  Recommend for teachers as a must.
B004TI5N38|5.0|This was the perfect book to take with me on vacation. I enjoyed part of it on the flight down and on the flight back to my vacation spot in the Caribbean. It's fast paced and full of surprises. It's also very well researched- especially regarding military armaments and procedures.
B000055Y0Y|5.0|This DVD arrived in excellent  condition and plays beautifully. I am glad to have it included in my private collection.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I didn't watch Firefly on TV before it was canceled, so I've only seen the DVD's. This is the best way to watch, and Serenity was the perfect closure to a show that ended way too soon.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this book. Once you pick it up you can't stop reading it. I think you will love it if you get it. Don't  forget about the other books.
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|What could have been a decent story line is completely mowed over by excessive gore.  I enjoyed it, but felt they could have done so much better with the story.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Love this. game it challenges you and that is what I'm looking for this game rocks for the younger and older generations. Up for the challenge
8866134627|2.0|Good design, size and construction.  If only the paper was better quality this notebook would be perfect.  It's the only good quality notebook manufacturer using American standard paper dimensions but the pages are too thin and transparent for even an extra fine fountain pen.
1594203334|5.0|I am American and Really like the sights she has. Some things I think us americans can change how we act towards babies and kids. Really like this book
B003JTHXOK|4.0|It serves as a reminder to never settle in life. There can be something awaiting your presence that is much more meaningful and rewarding.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|Not a bad movie. It is different than the original Bourne series as the theme of this one is wondering why you are being exterminated versus the original theme of getting back at those who wish to terminate you. There is plenty of action and the necessary female supporting side kick but the blood pumping revenge-heated juice is replaced only by the tension of escape. I enjoyed the film because the acting was not disappointing and the characters were likeable, but the Bourne theme of trying to balance the weight of injustice doesn't really come much to the surface here so there is a lack of satisfaction at the end. A second movie could extract my final judgement.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Definitely recommend! It's a quick read and I like the style of the author. It seems like a good book for this generation.
B008OOYALE|3.0|dragonsvale is a whole lot better than this. come on teamlava. don't copy people.I know its hard to come up with new ideas but just don't copy.if you get this game, get dragonsvale too!
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I had never seen the musical production but a couple of the better known songs I had heard. This film was totally an experience not to miss. Great to see true talent on the screen.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|Always wanted to understand why the outspoken person got the recognition, the promotion or the acknowledgement from others even though you did a better job.  This book is designed to help the introverts understand and manage around extroverts.  The author has taken into account years of research, studies and test cases where they introduced introverts, in all ages, into certain situations to see how they react and why.  With the background and studies, which the author has provided she indicates our society focuses and rewards the extroverts.  She also provided examples of great introverts and how they have changed the world.  They did not have brain storming session or group meetings but in many cases, they went off alone to work in quiet.  If you struggle as an introvert then this is necessary read.  Not only will you understand why you are an introvert and how to function better but also you will have a better understand the extroverts around you.<br /><br />I received a free copy of this book from Waterbrook Multnomah Publishing in exchange for my honest review of the book.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|Loving it; the wry humor is great, you can't beat it.<br />I will say that in this version, the pictures are listed at the start of each part of the book, so you'd have to go back and click on one of the pictures in the list in order to see it. Having pics within the book would be much better. But I think that's probably the trade off with the free classics that are digitally created by volunteers. Not that I'm complaining!
B005KR6OBM|5.0|I have not yet bought these dvds the reason they come on every night I'm thinking tbs I record them but can only keep five at one time. The price has come down from a hundred and some to eighty, I am seventy and watched many a show that were funny in the day but nothing like this. I love when Penny and Sheldon are together by themself talking the looks on Penny face is priceless, no matter what she gets the best of him.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|I love this game! I play a lot of games instead of watching Tv while I entertain and this one is an all time classic!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is better than temple run it reset my score once but I still like it my friend was right when he told me to download it
B0071MQBX0|5.0|I wanted to get this for a long time finally I noticed that it was available in Amazon and at a great price, I watched as soon it arrived and I love it I can watch it overand over I been following ALW for years
B00991TCOG|5.0|My youngest (of four children) son told me the term &#34;Dubstep&#34; a few months ago and I thought, ok another musical fad to endure in our house.  In my 52 years, I have embraced most everything from Mozart to Metallica to Eminim and I can even tolorate some country music.<br /><br />I came across  one of Lindsey's cover videos and enjoyed the quality of the production and the style her and her friends put on the already great music.  I followed the links to some of her other cover videos, her channel and then her original music.  I had become a believer.  I bought this CD as a Christmas present to myself and play it a few times a week on my headphones at work.  I am anxiously waiting for her to follow it up after she gets done with her Winter 2013 tour so I can make a longer playlist.<br /><br />Her energy and persistance is an inspiration even to an old guy like me.  Stay true to yourself Lindsey, and get back to work !
B006GHA9QQ|5.0|It grows on you after we were told that it was going to be better then the Phantom of the Opera
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I was told by many that I would love this show since I love period books. They couldn't have been more right. There are so many intricate story lines about the family and their servants along with the changing times. I can't wait to watch it each week!
B000JQUKKU|5.0|First time reading this story. I've seen many movies of the story. Great little read. Enjoyed very much. Very good story.
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|I ordered the item from Amazon on a Wednesday early in the morning and got it the very next day.  It was even better in person then shown by Amazon and was well received by my son-in-law.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This is a brilliantly researched and written novel that sucks you into the past until you feel like it's the present and fascinates you until the very end when you are left completely satisfied yet somehow still hungry for more!
B006O7XOOW|4.0|Works well and keeps her entertained. Kinda hard to keep up with where all the balls are and she is still learning how to stand and balance so I think she is going to break the motor of the thing on top because as she stands she keeps her hands pressed on the yellow thing that pushes the balls up.  but nice toy.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I've recommended this book to many of my friends and family. T'was great!!! Read it if you've not done so yet - it's worth your while!
B007SGLZP8|2.0|I couldn't get into this book.  I read it because it was a gift.  I read it fast because I just wanted it to be over with.  There was obviously no &#34;real-world&#34; thought or reasearch put into this book, which is what makes most of Grisham's books so likeable.  It was very obvious while reading it - and then when you get to the end, the author even admits it.  I think he wanted to try his hand at a pure fiction and it just didn't go over well.  It might have a lot to do with the fact that I live in the area he writes about and there were so many glaring errors - so there's a little bias, I suppose.  Even without that, the story's not very fun or exciting.<br /><br />I'm sure there's a lot of you out there like me that would have a hard time passing up the newest Grisham novel.  Maybe skip on this one if you can wait for the library to get it.  Next time, I won't put it on my wishlist until I hear a little more about it.
B0058VW36U|4.0|Very nice game. My 8 year old son and I enjoy playing and helping each other to get the &#34;little monster&#34; fed. Good way to pass the time when you are traveling.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|I love this little guy, though it was a lot bigger than it looks in the pictures, my hand fits well on it and dosent crap even after long ours of use.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|Much better than the original Angry Birds, that is already good. The different phases with new features like the gravitational force are really nice and make you find different alternatives to win the game.
B007SGM084|4.0|Didn't make me blush, but I loved the trilogy anyway. Will definitely read it again. And maybe a 3rd time.
B001HN694K|5.0|Love this movie!
B00846REIS|5.0|Loved both characters, this is a great book. Couldn't stop reading it and bought the 2nd part immediately. I was not disappointed neither ;)
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|My wife is hooked! That never happens so this is a winner!  The second season was free with the Prime membership.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved this final book of the series. It is the crudest one and it doesn't have the happy end hollywood style some readers would expect, but it made me think about many issues. So worth the reading
B0071BGOJC|5.0|Ken Follett is always a good read and so well researched.  It is a BIG book but I took it on holiday and read it in two weeks.  I did not want it to end!  So interesting and a pleasure to read on the Kindle!  No heavy book to hold.
B00ACBN9CI|1.0|I installed the app. I tried to play it, however, it keep saying it had to close do to an error.  I uninstalled it and reinstalled. Still got the same message.  I uninstaled and reinstaled a second time with the same problem.  This game is a piece of crap. Do not bother.
0345803485|3.0|My friend share this book with me and she likes it a lots, I think it wasn't as good as she described but I think its just personal preference. Nothing unexpected but its easy to read.
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|Diana Gabaldon delivers another favorite with Drums of Autumn.  Claire is smart, funny, sexy - what more could a woman want? It truly is difficult to pigeonhole any of the Outlander books into one specific genre, and Drums of Autumn is no different.  I love that there's something for everyone in her books.  Diana Gabaldon does not shy away from any subject matter, that I can see, and I admire that in an author as long as it's well done (and it is). I've recommended this series to many, many friends and I always love to get their excited feedback. The books are ginormous, but then that's another thing I love about them.
B000ROALCG|5.0|C'était le cadeau de Noël pour mon conjoint donné par notre fils. Le cd joue en boucles interminables. Excellente interprétation des chansons d'Hector Lavoe par Mark Anthony. Superbe voix!!!
B00280LYIC|5.0|Very entertaining and action packed I like this book for relationship in two themes mythology and action  great writing Rick Riordon
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I read this book in one day...had me gripped....however, the conclusion wasn't as dramatic as I anticipated but it was great.

B005NJU8PA|5.0|Very interesting variety of topics covered and very inspiring in the kitchen!  Plus it's a huge book!  Definitely a must read!
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|The second season of American horror story just keeps on going and it keeps you wanting to watch more. Better than season one!!
B008FRFN7A|5.0|Really like the way I can print now on my kindle..little trouble getting it set up but once my son got his thinking cap on it became pretty easy. I really am happy with this & so far works really wonderful..so far no flaws..running nicely!!!
B009KS4XRO|1.0|Another game that looked fun clicked through from somewhere else so didn't read the description but facebook and paying for other items is a big part of this and if you don't do these things the game is very limited. I don't have facebook and am not interested in it so this game is a big NO for me.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I enjoyed reading the book and couldn't put it down as the mystery unravels.  I wanted to read this before the movie came out because books that get made into movies always provide more insight into the characters and plotline than the movie does.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This sequel was not a let down like most of them are. It had so many twists and turns it kept me going. Ms Collins know how to bring a story to life.
B004KZDV8E|5.0|Product came as described... Runs wonderfully on my new PC build... Has the power i need to get things done!! Highly Recommend!
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|This book gets a three star rating because I absolutely could not put it down, but I can't explain why. I can explain why the rational side of me wants to give it a lower rating:<br />CHARACTERS/VOICE:<br />I felt that the majority of the characters were pretty one-dimensional. From the beginning Sky is a fun character to follow and she has a funny personality and voice but there wasn't enough back-story to explain her lack of access to technology. Surely a lover of books would have been to the public library and had access to the internet or she could have used it at her friend's house. I would have found it more believable if she just wasn't interested in finding out about her past because her life had been so good. Some might argue that she respected her mother's wishes by not using technology since her mother was respectful enough to trust her, but why would she respect her mother's wishes about technology and not about boys? She wasn't respecting her mother when she was sneaking boys through her window. I guess that sounds sanctimonious, but I'm just trying to give an example of an inconsistency in her character. I think she was a good example of a teenage voice, until the second half of the book, which I'll get into later.<br />Though Holder has a lot of moods, he is still just another not-so-repressed teenage boy who is not being honest with the person he supposedly loves, or \\"lives\\" in the case of this book. I didn't feel like his character grew all that much, he just got better at hiding his mood swings. To be fair he was dealing with having to make decisions that we feel young people shouldn't have to deal with, but I felt like he should have been honest with Sky from an earlier point about what he knew about her past.<br />Then, after the curtain falls away and we get pelted with the terrifying details and sodden emotions of what happened to these characters in the past, suddenly Sky's literary-voice is no longer that of a teenager but an older adult, andit doesn't transition naturally. The story goes from showing to teaching. I understand that Sky would have had to \\"grow up a lot\\" during this experience but she goes from the voice of a teenager to the voice of a high school guidance counselor. I feel like we didn't get to watch Sky deal with finding out about her past because we were reading from the point-of-view of a totally different (older) character with the same name.<br />Really the only other character with any depth at all is Sky's mother, and that doesn't come out until the conclusion.<br />The characters of Six and Breckin are almost interchangeable. They add a little lighthearted banter but the plot could have gone on with or without them; the plot would have remained unchanged if Breckin had been the one to go to Italy and Six stayed...they just didn't add anything unique to the plot.<br />TOPICS/AUDIENCE<br />I do believe that the topics addressed in this book including sexual abuse, suicide and teen sexuality are things that need to be discussed, but I would suggest reading this with your child/teen if you want them to be exposed to these subjects through a book. This book definitely presents those topics in a no-holds-barred kind of fashion, which speaks to the weightiness of those subjects as we face them in reality. I realize we can't just tip-toe around these issues as though they aren't important or aren't violent/dramatic but I worry, again, about kids in middle school, who might not be old enough to handle this material, picking this book up in a library and reading it with no one to explain everything to them. Kids, teens and some adults (including myself) can become unhealthily empathetic toward such relatable characters. In general I don't think that this book is appropriate for the YA audience. Books marketed toward the Young-Adult audience are generally marketed toward kids between the ages of 11 and 16. The subject mater and it's presentation in this book push what would have to be theboundaries of even the most free-spirited parent of a pre-teen. The subject matter is heavy and graphic. There is a moderate amount of profanity and a lot of sex, talk of sexual experimentation, two suicides (one of them incredibly graphic) and a lot of this is presented as a normal backdrop for teenage life. I didn't think it was appropriate that Holder, when Sky tries to ask him to stop during an intimate scene, asks her not to ask him to stop and worse, she agrees.<br />I will admit that this book kept me guessing at the end. I really wasn't sure what Sky was going to do with all of the information that she had to assimilate.<br />That's all I can really say about the ending without giving away everything about the book. Would I recommend this book to an actual young adult? Yes. Would I recommend this book to the YA audience? Probably not.
B008AYCSE4|4.0|i think michael fassbender is a talented young actor.i think it takes great courage to agree to go full frontal.once you get beyond all that,you will notice he did a brilliant piece of acting.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Just like always-I couldn't put Nicholas Spark's book down.It held my interest through-out the story.After reading a few of his books,I really want to travel to the Carolinas.This was a love story sprinkled with suspense.If you are a Nicholas Sparks fan you wont be disappointed!
B00006D29Z|4.0|i think the sequel to blade is respectable.i find it lives up to the hype.and i like norman reedus in the movie.

B007FJFDXS|2.0|I do not see any point to this game. There are no instructions and I cannot see how it can have any reason to play.
B0043VCPW8|5.0|This is a stipped down, acustic version of his songs. Most are songs that everyone knows along with a few newer ones. This is from one of his live shows and is an amazing compilation. Very highly recommended.

B006LSZECO|5.0|I can understand why this novel is so very popular. Love the simple easy to understand way this author tells her story. I am now going to read another of her books which I'm sure I'll love also. Easy fast read that really keeps you wanting to know how it's going to end!!

B008US4PBY|1.0|I've been looking for a solution to my problems with using the PS3 controller. I dislike the way the controller feels in my hands, so when I found the Cronus I thought my problem would soon be resolved. The Cronus Adapter arrived on time as expected and was in normal clam shell packaging.<br /><br />However, when I plugged the adapter into my PS3 and my wired Xbox 360 controller into the adapter I was greeting with absolutely nothing. No connectivity, no indication that the device was even working. After pouring over the poorly thrown together instructions included with the product I decided to take my search for answers online. first looking at the companies website. After tinkering with the included cable and the software that is not included (must be downloaded from their website) I managed to get the adapter to light up, with the display showing that it was ready to be loaded with a profile from the program.<br /><br />After setting everything up I plugged the adapter into my PC to test the setting to make sure everything was in working order. about four to five seconds after plugging the adapter into my computer, it blue screens and shuts off. Something my computer never does. So I thought that it was just a fluke. maybe my computer is just getting old. I shrugged off the looming thought of having to buy a new laptop and restarted the testing process and wouldn't you know it. The little adapter that wasn't doing squat just a couple hours ago was now an instant blue screen key of death. neato.<br /><br />So After this adventure in destroying my computer I unplug the device and put it up till the next day, when I can talk to their tech support to see if I can sort out the matter and get the little bugger working. But much to my dismay, although not surprising after seeing the quality of their product, their tech support is magically unreachable. Neither by phone or internet. So here I sit with a 70 dollar blue screen dongle.<br /><br />to cut it short; It's a junk product, that doesn't work, is over priced for not working, and has absolutely zero customer service to back it up. Save your money folks. it just isn't worth it.

B003Y5H5HY|5.0|Great movie. worth every penny. The dramatic scenes and the edgy sex scene with full nudity are odd in today's theatrical society. Fincher nails the essence of the book.

B006DRVFRQ|3.0|I dislike the prominence of the ads - I often click on the ad when I'm trying to click on the menu button.<br /><br />I think I'd rather the app be simpler - I don't need it to have a web reader built-in - just use whatever browser is available in the OS.<br /><br />Sometimes items don't get automatically marked as read, I haven't figured out why that is.<br />But, it works, and lets me get some of the reading done when I'm not in front of the computer, and it is faster than the greader app I have on my phone.

B008K6HN8I|5.0|I expected this to be a local file reader, and it fills that gap, but I was surprised to see the dropbox, FTP and gdrive, etc. integration.

Since the winter break started I told myself I was going to finish it before the next semester.<br /><br />Wow.. it's amazing story line. You really do feel for the main character. I also was talking to myself saying, \\"Oh you're crazy, NO!!\\" \\"I knew it!!\\"<br /><br />It's a fantastic read. Enjoy!

B0063GORYU|4.0|I really like playing this game. I find it more interesting than regular solitare. The single suit is the easiest, and one can win a lot. I play two suits, and don't win as much but I find it relaxing.  If you really want a challenge, play three or four suits. Play this when you just want something to do with your hands while sitting for a long time.

0765325950|5.0|I devoured this action-packed finale to the Wheel of Time series.  I think that the battles were of epic scope.  Despite the desperate fight of the forces of light against almost hopelessly overwhelming odds, there were some much needed points of laugh-out-loud humor thrown in that helped to relieve some of the building tension.  I felt that the major arcs of the story were resolved satisfactorily, while at the same time, there were enough smaller threads left over to cause the reader to sit and speculate about the aftermath of the book.  I love books and films that leave room and allow you to imagine what happens next.  It allows you to create your own satisfying  endings to various subplots.<br /><br />Not everything in the story turned out to my liking, but I realize that war is a terrible thing and unspeakable and tragic things will inevitably occur.  Many well-known characters \\"woke up from the dream\\" in the course of this finale.  No one escaped unscathed.  There was so much carnage at various points, that I did not have time to shed a tear for the tragedies that unfolded.  I just realized that war is hell, and that almost anything could happen both good and bad.  The book showed how the heroic actions and choices of a few had a major impact on the final outcome of the story.  Many times, a single decision by a character could have spelled the difference between absolute victory or defeat.  Timing was also critical--Do something at the wrong time and disaster would result.  One of my favorite aspects of the book was learning about how Perrin grew and further developed his skills within the Wolf dream.  Another was how Mat's unappreciated military genius began to be recognized.<br /><br />One thing that I had hoped would be developed further was how the three Taveren's ability to see each other through the colors in their heads would affect the outcome of the story.  However, this element, which Jordan seemed to be developing as a future central element was nottaken advantage of.  One would have thought that Mat, Perrin, and Rand's ability to see what the others were up to would have played a major role in the Final Battle.<br /><br />At times, I have compared the Wheel of Time series to the Lord of the Rings.  Like the latter, the outcome of the story came down to the actions and decisions of various individuals including thousands of unnamed people who joined in the battle and put their lives on the line.  There was also an element of luck and timing involved.  Details such as the fate of the Horn of Valere and whether it would be blown or not (and by which side) kept me on the edge of my seat.  I also liked the philosophical interchange between Rand and the Dark Lord.  It showed that our fates are not fixed in stone--Our individual choices have a direct effect on the future.<br /><br />I enjoyed how Sanderson kept jumping from one venue to another which allowed the reader to see what was going on in various key areas of the land.  Then, all of these separate elements began to be neatly tied together to paint the larger picture.<br /><br />I also enjoyed many of the individual love stories between various characters set within the context of the potential end of the Wheel--Mat and Tuon, Perrin and Faile, Rand and Avienda and Elayne and Min, Siuan Sanche and Gareth Bryne, Egwene and Gawyn, Berelain and Galad, Nynaeve and Lan Mandragoran, Birgitte and Gaidal, Loial and Erith, Moiraine and Thom etc.  Which couples, if any, would survive?  Of course, I was concerned about the fate of the World, but at the same time, I wondered about these individual lives.  For some like Perrin, their true love was their entire world.
B003WKOU0G|5.0|Watched this with my mother and my daughter and we all loved it.  My dad got a little uncomfortable with what is labeled &#34;maternal nudity&#34; and didn't finish watching.  (Remember those pictures of African women in National Geographic when you were a kid? That kind of stuff.)  Follows the lives and families of four babies born in the U.S., Japan, Africa and Mongolia.  No actual plot, just watching clips of various stages in their first year of life and showing the comparisons.  NOTE:  I did see it cheaper in Target, by about $3, I still considered the Amazon price very good.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I love when I'm so into a book that I just can't put it down.  This was the case with Defending Jacob.  The story was spellbinding, heartbreaking,  and incredibly well written.

Colleen Hoover is amazing! 5 stars and I never do that!!! Speechless! I cried, I laughed, I felt like I was part of the book. It really touched me and I caught myself sometimes just staring at the writing and just thinking this is so amazing. really I'm just speechless! I had been in a reading slump for a bit and this book definitely took me out of it.<br /><br />Holder and Sky have a special place in my heart and their connection was like no other!<br /><br />I think, well I know everyone needs to read this book!!<br /><br />Colleen you did it again! amazing!
B007BFSYMS|3.0|The application was attempted on Kindle fire and I am pleased to report that it does work well. The interface is clean and the sounds are good quality with nice background photos of what you are listening to. The application runs in the background and provides soothing sounds (Or white noise of your choice) while allowing you to read a book or simply do nothing but look at the clock. The Clock is big and easy to read and has a lot of alarm and snooze features. The application will consume battery for sure but this is a app I do not mind running when I am charging the kindle fire and going to sleep.<br /><br />Having said, what I hate is integration of Twitter and Facebook and host of other online activity that is seen embedded in this paid application. Some applications such as these really do not need such integration. This app is for personal private use and is to be used for just that nothing more nothing less. Why Facebook? Why Twitter? when all you need is peace of mind!<br /><br />With all that said, when there is a will there is a way. If you turn off your Wi-Fi and immerse yourself in the included noises you will find that it does help you concentrate on what you need to do even if it means going to sleep. Trust me with today's hectic lifestyle going to sleep also seems to be a chore!<br /><br />Thanks for offering this as a FAOTD. I do appreciate it. IMHO, Remove all web integration and you have a 5 star application.

B003Y5D776|5.0|I have a Macbook Air that I wanted to use at my desk without having to plug in a bunch of cables.<br /><br />I have a monitor w/ USB ports. I wanted to just have to plug in my laptop power, one USB, and the monitor cable and be done.<br /><br />This product works well for my needs and has given my very little trouble.<br /><br />The only issue I had with it was when I was using 10.7 and I had this device plugged into a cheap USB hub. Occasionally, when opening a flash video with sound, the computer would hang for a while. Unplugging the iMic would make the computer start working immediately, so I knew it was related. I moved the iMic to the back of my Apple 23&#34; ACD monitor USB plug, and it hasn't given me any trouble since.<br /><br />Quality is great - no lag and working great with Mountain Lion 10.8!

B00A9X9TIW|2.0|So I am not going to write a spoiler review.  I will only say that the story started very interesting.  It goes way beyond what the trailer portrays.  There is great buildup and suspense.  The ending sucked and didn't make any sense.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Terrific series and season three does not disappoint. Great option to view the episodes prior to the DVD release. 4 stars
B007RI56NY|3.0|I'm a big fan of the group, Train.  However, I was disappointed with the title track of this CD; because of the venom it lashes at women.  Their songs usually have more humor (even about break-ups, which happen to everyone).  But the title song is venomous and the hatred of women in this song is not something I can endorse.  I'm really disappointed.  There are some other good songs on this album; but I'd delete the title track on this.
0486290492|5.0|Sense and Sensibility was published in 1811 when Jane Austen was just 36 years old, and only 2 years before the publication of Pride and Prejudice. In the span of such a short time, and almost 200 years ago from today, Jane Austen produced two timeless classics. I find it bitterly ironic that in almost every case, a classic is known by the whole world over - celebrated, written about, studied, discussed in painstaking details in a classroom, read aloud in packed lecture halls and admired by masses - yet the creator of it all is spared this knowledge of success.<br /><br />Sense and Sensibility's characters add richness and color to the story, where the central theme revolves around two sisters, opposite in character and ideals, both in mild struggle with the life choices afforded to them because of their situation, their connections, and their small fortune. The Dashwood sisters, Elinor and Marrianne, live with Mrs. Dashwood, their mother and younger sister, Margaret. When Mr. Dashwood dies, he leaves the decision of their care in the hands of his son, John. John has never played the role of a compassionate step-brother to his father's other family but he is not vindictive or evil. His wife Fanny is. The Dashwoods are politely and slowly forced out of their beloved home in Norwood, as John is persuaded out of any kindness that Fanny found appropriate for their living situation.  The compassionate cousin of Mrs. Dashwood, Sir John Middleton, offers the family to live in a small cottage, Barton Park, for as long as they shall like.<br /><br />The sense of duty and responsibility from Elinor is unparalleled. When she learns that Lucy is secretly engaged to the love of her life, Edward, she is stunned and saddened when the terrible news is confirmed as true. We do not see a single outburst of anger, frustration, disappointment from Elinor's lips or thoughts. She continues to care for Marianne's deep wounds over Willoughby and does not mention a word of her own loss. For four months, she is resilient and silent to even Marianne, for she has promised Lucy to keep the secret for her.  How she endures it all is a testament to her character. She exerts herself to be strong, and act with dignity even at the expense of her own happiness.<br /><br />Perhaps it is ironic that Elinor who is the sensible one with such measured approach to her desires is in the end united with the true love of her life, Edward - while Marianne, who is the sensitive, emotional, passionate, idealistic one, is rejected by Willoughby, suffers greatly in love, and is at last united with Colonel Brandon, whom she neither liked nor respected earlier in the story. Is Austen telling us that it is better to be sensitive or sensible, or that both will do as they may, and life will happen all around us, and we shall never choose our destiny - rather, it chooses us?<br /><br />Whatever the answer may be, Jane Austen is one of my favorite authors of all time and I can't get enough of her! Read your classics!! :)four months, she is resilient and silent to even Marianne, for she has promised Lucy to keep the secret for her.  How she endures it all is a testament to her character.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I have not had the pleasure of reading anything by Colleen Hoover until this gem.  It was such a fabulous book.  I adored the characters, felt the passion and emotion from the beginning to the end, and wished there was more.  It is very rare that I finish a book and want there to be a sequel...

B007SGLZP8|2.0|I think this is the first book of Mr. Grisham that I would not recommend to another to read or buy.  I gave it a reluctant 2 star because the idea behind the book was a good one on a subject to write about but it was just too slow paced compared to other novels by this great author.

B004QX07G4|3.0|Having recently read Portia's autobiography, Unbearable Lightness, and several humorous books by female authors, Let's Pretend This Never Happened by Jenny Lawson, How To Be A Woman by Caitlin Moran, and Bossypants by the amazing Tina Fey, I was prepared to love this book.  It's Ellen, I thought, I love Ellen, and I like funny women, and this should be great.  It wasn't great.  If I had paid more than the $1.99 I would be really disappointed.<br /><br />This is not to say this book ins't funny, because it is.  It's just not laugh out loud funny, like any of the three books by the ladies I mentioned above.  It's not engrossing like Portia's book.  It just kind of exists.  You will chuckle a few times, but it's not memorable and you won't rush out to recommend it to your friends.  It's not bad, it's just that there is so much that's better that I wouldn't recommend it.

B000MD9UJC|3.0|This upgrade kit includes the LED itself, a reflector, and the tail switch.  The tail switch is of very low quality.  In no way is it an improvement over Maglite's original tail cap, so I prefer to go without it and use the flashlight in the stock \\"twist-on\\" mode.  The LED and reflector must be used together, as the LED doesn't fit in the stock reflector.<br />The light it produces is significantly brighter than the stock incandescent bulb.  I'll believe it produces 30 lumens.  The light is cool white and fairly even.  Battery life seems to have increased, but not by much.  The focus system doesn't work anymore really, as the disc the LED is mounted on is quite thick and limits the focusing bezel's travel.  The reflector is thicker than the stock one, meaning the lens cap doesn't screw on as snugly, even with the lens removed.<br />It's an improvement over the incandescent bulb, but for the money you would pay for this and an incandescent 2xAA mini-mag, you could buy an LED mini-mag and have an even brighter light.<br />If this is all you can afford, and you've already got an old mini-mag, go for it.  Otherwise, just do something else.
B009HOU672|5.0|By the time I finished listening to this CD twice, I went from &#34;interested&#34; to<br />loving it.  The instruments truly &#34;sing&#34; and give even more life to the<br />passages in each &#34;season&#34;.  It never strays so far afield that you don't<br />know you're listening to the Four Seasons.  I applaud Max Richter.
B008MEM24S|5.0|very challenging, forcing one to think outside the box... some complex situations for a game! definitely will build brain power! intriguing... addictive... and fun too. recommend highly.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|\\"Pitch Perfect\\" is a comedy that never takes itself too seriously as it pokes fun at the world of acappella singing, but at the same time doesn't become overly cheesy and bogged down with gags and low-class jokes.  Yes, many of the characters are pretty stereotypical of your \\"college underdogs trying to over-achieve\\" movies.  You have your obese character, your up-on-their-high-horse character, your outcast-trying-to-fit-in character, your boy-trying-to-win-girl's-heart character, etc., so maybe a little more creativity there is left to be desired. Still, that doesn't stop this movie from being a fun romp with plenty of solid laughs along the way.  Definitely worth watching!
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Very well written. A quick read despite the size. I almost started crying in public at one point if te story. That's when I new without a doubt that it was great.
B0050R0XPA|5.0|My 10yr old daughter received this set for Christmas. I wasn't sure if it would be too difficult, or if she'd actually sustain interest long enough to complete it. No need to worry, this was probably the best Christmas present ever. She worked on it off and on throughout the vacation, had a few moments of frustration but worked it all out on her own. (She did get stuck near the end because it was missing several pieces. Ordering the pieces was no problem from Lego direct, but it did take two weeks to receive them.) She finally finished it last week and it's absolutely adorable!!! The attention to detail is amazing!  She already wants other sets in the collection. I envision she will build on in time and it will be something she will keep and use for her own Christmas decorations when she's older.  Great set, highly recommend for kids or adults!
B0085TKAW6|5.0|An exceptional read and while I know I will have to wait, wish book 3 was available now.  Ken Follet is one of my favourite  authors and this book did not disappoint
B004HYXW1O|5.0|This is one of my new favorite bands, I love their music!  This album is very good from beginning to end, I don't think there is one song on it that I don't like.
B009SCRERI|5.0|I'm a big kid at heart and like basically like all the tinker bell movies but kids do respond well to this movie.
B009GED3HS|5.0|I was late to find this show & have been catching up on all the past seasons; I absolutely love it!!
B006ELF6AI|4.0|This particular season had a slow start with the characters,  but i can tell you it gets better in the season ahead so it is worth watching
B004EBT5CU|3.0|now the recording mater quality is HORRIBLE.<br />I can't believe the recording quality is so terrible. not only the sound balance/mix is off, but the recording quality is sub par. if a singer of this category stands in front of the microphone, hire someone who knows what needs to be done.... what a waste...
B009IF8CH6|5.0|There isn't a episode i don't like in any of the season,my favorite character is sheldon, its just very funny and entertaining.
034580404X|4.0|I heard so much chatter about the office regarding the trilogy, I felt compelled to check it out.  I also heard it described as pure smut.  But what I found was both entertaining and gently captivating.  Some of these type of books dive into what some find to be totally unrealistic.  But I'm not one of those.  You see, there were many edgey events that border on what I think can be some of the most binding aspects of a relationship between two lovers.  They built from physical attraction; moved on to carnal desires; experimented together; and eventually built a relationship of trust and adoration which reached far beyond what happens in all too many high society relationships.  They successfully integrated their lust into a bonded (pun intended) union which helped maintain the electricity of their love for one another in spite of all other distractions.  I think many who read the triology were envious of the characters!
B005J6LKVI|5.0|Of course anyone who likes watching this movie loves the maid Minnie, it too makes you think of things were back then.
B005ERIRZE|5.0|then this book is for you. Reading it through once then going back and working on items listed in each chapter. Very, very helpful.
B0084IG7KC|4.0|This movie has some really good characters in it,  u just can't wait for the next one to see what happens
B007SGM084|2.0|These books are the greatest of all times. I love each one. I couldn't put them down. I'm hoping there's more to come.
B004EPZ08Y|4.0|This particular final destination movie was a little more close up with the gory accidents that is always forseen at the beginning,but this movie has a good ending even we know how the movie goes.
032180354X|3.0|Unlike most of the reviewers of this book, I had not heard of Dustin Diaz before, nor was I aware of his 365 project. I take it that he had a pre-built audience that had certain expectations for his style and content.<br /><br />So as a new reader for this author, I've probably found this to be one of the most challenging books to write a fair review. The main reason I say that is because he has a very annoying, hipster writing style that's probably more suited for a different reader than myself. It's tough to review, because there's probably people who think that the writing is witty or even funny, but I find it very hard to keep reading.<br /><br />Fortunately, there is not THAT much writing in the book, so if you're more interested in the pictures, then that's different.<br /><br />I'd have to say that this book is more of an idea book or a project book rather than an educational book on really understanding strobes. It's filled with various types of photos around San Francisco (mostly off camera flash projects taken at night, usually with a gel), along with a photo of the setup and some text. In this respect, the book does a good job in helping people get familiar with what a speedlight can do in various conditions, and seeing the results.<br /><br />The author does state some things which I found hard to reconcile. For example, he states you must buy a wireless trigger and is quite dismissive of anyone who recommends corded off camera flash cable. Well, Syl Arena (author of Speedlighter's Handbook) states it's a must have, and I tend to agree. Maybe it's not as convenient, but it's rock solid reliable and supports TTL, and people learning flash (like the readers of this book), can understand a lot of the concepts before going to full manual as required by the majority of the wireless triggers.<br /><br />When I went back to look at the author's blog, I understand why he built an audience on his 365. It's because it follows a similar format to this book, namelyshowing a shot and explaining how it was done. It's not just a collection of shots, but rather a collection of recopies for how to make a shot, and thus it helped a lot of people learn how certain things are made even if it doesn't really teach why it works.<br /><br />So overall, I think if you were a fan of his 365 project, you'll love the book. It's faster than clicking each picture and clicking through the explanation, since you can just flip through it. If you're new to the author, then I have to provide a disclaimer. It's a fine book as long as you don't have to read it.
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|Kids loved it. Husband even was entertained. Happy mamma here!!! Has been watched over and over again which I'm sure will continue.
B008AYA7WE|3.0|This game functions fine, it just doesnt become more of a challenge as the levels increase.  It seems to remain the same.  I played up to level seven but felt like I was still in level one or two.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Can't get enough of it. Now that we are all caught up we are waiting for the second half of Season 3 to start. This is one of the most stressful shows I have ever seen. So well done for the Zombie genre.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|I was very unsure about this movie after having heard and read some reviews. I wasn't sure if it was appropriate content for my 4 year old daughter. So, we rented it and enjoyed it enough to buy this 3 pack.<br /><br />1. This is NOT a typical Disney princess movie. My husband LOVED this the first time we watched it. There is a lot of boy humor in it which my daughter now enjoys. There is no boy she falls in love with and she does not get married in the end. The story is about her and her mother. It's a beautiful story.<br /><br />2. The bear scenes are not as scary as I thought they would be. Despite Merida turning her mother into a bear, her mother still acts like her mother - mannerisms and all. It's very funny and entertaining. There is another bear that is scary and those scenes are a bit sketchy but I would compare them to the wolf scenes in Beauty & the Beast. There is some witchcraft involved (as in most Disney movies) but it wasn't enough to bother me (unlike The Princess and the Frog which I think was horrible).<br /><br />3. The animation is fantastic and Merida is beautiful, especially her hair!<br /><br />4. The musical score is one of the best I've heard in a Disney movie. I would buy the CD in a heartbeat.<br /><br />Overall, I would highly recommend this movie for 4 and up. I think it may be too scary for kids younger than that and some of the boy humor may not be appropriate. The more I watch it, the more I love it. It's really a great movie!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This show is great. I think I could have done without the aliens in Season 2, but I suppose that it has something to do with the time period of the early 60's and claims about alien abductions. Love that there are recurring actors in the different story lines. Keeps everything kinda/sorta connected even thought they have  different story lines. Can't wait for Season 3!
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Once you adjust to the writing style of the time, it's so much easier to read. I love the way the writer approaches some topics from more than one person's point of view.  She makes the characters 3 dimensional.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|This is a wonderful book that kept me captivated from beginning to end. I cannot wait to read the rest of the series and see what happens to the characters.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|good wholesome fun<br />I really enjoyed playing this game.  . . . . . . .<br />not sure what else to write about it other than you should really try this game out
0486284735|5.0|There is just something special about holding a book in your hands to read it and not staring at a computer screen.
B004LWZWBU|4.0|Please note that I saw this on a movie channel so that I can't comment on the quality of the DVD release or its features.<br /><br />I thought this was a delightful little unpretentious movie that manages to entertain you without veering too far off its main theme (fanatical bird watchers) just for laughs or drama. In fact, there's enough humor in watching the antics of the three main characters all of whom are trying to out-smart and out-sleaze each other to capture the title of the greatest birdwatcher of the year. Jack Black, Steve Martin, and Owen Wilson are the perfect choices for their respective roles. Owen Wilson is the current record holder who's obsessed with maintaining his high perch , but his record is being stalked by Steve Martin and Jack Black who are trying to upset the established pecking order, with Martin as the driven company exec who unsuccessfully tries to leave his business, and Jack Black as the ne'er do well son who only seems to have one passion and talent in life, which is that he can identify almost any bird just from hearing a portion of its call.<br /><br />Most of the fun is watching the antics of these three looney birdwatchers as they all chase the Holy Grail of birdwatching, which is being the birder to record the most number of bird species in a single year. Wilson plays sort of the \\"bad guy\\" incumbent, although he's really too charming and disarming to make much of a real bad guy. Martin's plans keep being sabotaged by a couple of members of his executive staff who aren't quite ready to run the company on their own, and Jack is hampered by modest finances (it takes a lot of money to do this what with all the air travel), and a father who's not very sympathetic about his son's passion (played by veteran actor Brian Denehy).<br /><br />The movie actually qualifies as a pretty amazing travel flick, as the birders must flock to every nook and cranny of the U.S., from the Aleutian Islands to Maine to the Florida keys and almost everywhere in between to see all the birds. It's a truly delightful movie about an unlikely subject which manages to entertain  and make you laugh even if you know zip about birds and birding. Overall, it's a (although somewhat predictable) light-hearted minor masterpiece of humorous film-making that's worth a look if you're willing to try something a little different.here in between to see all the birds.

037582913X|5.0|This was my favorite book as a young kid, and I was VERY excited to be able to share it with my son. He laughs as I 'struggle' to turn the pages and foil Grover's plan to not turn the pages.
B00A6PD8RQ|3.0|I enjoyed this video but found it to be too simplistic.  I knew what would happen  before the action<br /> took place on the screen.  This would be a wonderful video to watch with a young child.
0375869840|2.0|This book is basically the exact same book only with Elmo thrown into the mix. It loses some of the magic of the original. Or maybe I am just biased toward the first book from my own childhood.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I enjoy playing MLP. It gives me a way to relax with my favorite characters. I am a grown lady and I ail never grow tired of MLP. I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys watching the shows. It is similar to some of the rb games. None I can name from the top of my head. Nevertheless, I enjoy this game and recommend it 100%.

030746363X|5.0|This book along with his other two books, has tons of amazing information.  If you are really into the biology, this gives very detailed info.  You may need to make notes to keep track of all the tips.<br />I would recommend this book no only for people trying to get to their ideal weight, but also for body builders or the average person looking to create a better self.<br />There are a lot of examples of how to improve fat-loss, sleep, running faster, swim quicker, great sex, etc.

1400067820|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and thought it introduced some very interesting and counterintuitive ideas. Mr. Taleb's writing style is highly enjoyable and unusual.  My only criticism: Mr. Taleb has a habit of introducing ideas and then offering evidence or examples several pages or even several chapters later.  However, if one is willing to put a certain amount of effort into the book, it is highly rewarding.

B008Y2VTIS|5.0|This show is really entertaining for a few reasons.<br /><br />1) It focuses on a time period rarely done in a tv series or movie.<br />2) It utilizes historic characters that most people have heard of.<br />3) Fantastic cast<br /><br />I'd recommend this series to anyone who enjoys gangster type tv shows or movies.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Adele is a very talented singer.  She could sing without music because her voice is so lovely.  I would recommend for all to buy.
B00846REIS|5.0|I admit that after reading fifty shades of grey I didn't think there would be anything remotely comparable. However Bared to You is what fifty shades of grey should have been. There is absolutely no comparison. It's obvious that Sylvia Day is the better author.<br />This story was flawlessly written, the characters were so well developed it was easy to fall in love with them. I loved the female character in this book, she was way more likable than Anastasia in fifty shades of grey. She was strong and she was his match she was not easily overtaken by Gideon. Which brings me to Gideon, he is absolutely dreamy, dark and Romantic at the same time.<br />I admit that all the talk of bondage and submission was not my cup of tea in shades of grey. I absolutely hated that aspect of the book. Bared to You was a lot more realistic in that sense. The love scenes were more tolerable, and they were simply better written. By far the better book!!!

B005AUWY90|5.0|I bought this movie for my 31/2 year old grandson to replace the one his mother left at the Jersey beach house last summer. The Blu-ray copy is sensational and the DVD copy is great. I got the combo for them so that they can leave the Blu-ray one at home and take the DVD with them on vacation this summer and hoping they remember to bring it back. You just have to love Cars2 it just amazing.

B000FBFN0Q|4.0|Career, growing up, roommate problems, overly protective parents, money, relationships, sloppy living, collections agencies, credit cards, and shopping. What do all these things have in common? Rebecca Bloomwood.<br /> The first book of Sophie Kinsella's Confessions of a Shopaholic, adapted from its British equivalent, The Secret Dream World of a Shopaholic, is a delightfully refreshing approach to how one semi-neurotic woman attempts to balance life after college with the disappointments of an inadequate, low-paying job. Rebecca Bloomwood, a financial journalist living in an upscale flat with her best friend, finds it hard to pass up shopping opportunities of every variety. However, her low-paying job combined with excessive shopping pushes Becky's debt over the limit. Faced with a reoccurring collections agent, too-proud parents, a pushover best friend and her own failures, Becky hilariously attempts to pay off all debts with self-help books, endless letters to the bank demanding they fix her account errors, and even falling off the face of the planet to avoid being found. Without guidance, without telling the truth, and without any excuses, Becky must construct a way to get out of debt. And what could be worse? Everyone in Becky's life is trying to set her up. Her roommate wants her to date a tacky Scottish millionaire, and her parents, with the combined efforts of Becky's childhood neighbors, are trying to set Becky up with Becky's engaged, socially awkward neighbor.<br /> Perhaps comparable as a cleaner and thinner Bridget from Bridget Jones' Diary, Becky joins the ranks of lovable, realistic, British literary comedians. Although the book is geared towards female readers, Becky is a relatable character for everyone both in, and out, of college. For anyone who has ever woken up, looked around and wondered how they ended up where they had, Becky is completely relatable. She embodies an entire generation of well-to-do college graduates who may find themselves justa little over their heads. Yet, just like many of us would, Becky refuses to admit that she has any issues for fear that others would judge her own bad decisions. Combining the delightful awkwardness that we all possess a little of and the grown-up, post-college angst, the purchases, encounters and regrets never cease to stop being funny.<br /> Despite the ability to connect well with the characters in the book and find humor in the daily mishaps and desperate situations, there is no realistic emphasis on the desperation. There is something of an encouragement to assimilate with Becky's situation. The vivid descriptions of luxurious shopping goods and the main character's constant reiterations that maxing-out a credit card is okay and, in fact, a way of life, was a beyond immature solution to an adult problem. Perhaps the point of the inner-commentary was to portray our own thought processes when doing something against our better judgment, but I fully believe the nonchalant addressing of shopping and overdrafts as a part of daily life manipulated me into maxing out my own credit card and purchasing the entire book series. Hopefully, the next books in the series will address this issue in an adult, rather than an adolescent, perspective.<br /> For those who loved other British comedies, such as Bridget Jones' Diary, as well as subsequent novels, and even novels such as White Girl Problems, Confessions of a Shopaholic is perfect for you.

B005M7P9XE|5.0|So happy I got the Deluxe version.  It includes a DVD of their live performances.  They are amazing live.<br /><br />Have been a fan since I heard &#34;Better Than Love&#34; in the summer of 2010.  Was instantly in love.  Highly recommend them to any 80's pop/dance fan.
B000FC1MM8|4.0|Superb mystery novel.  Connelly's character development is so well done, the reader becomes one with Bosch.  The plot is intricate, yet not far fetched.  As with most of the Harry Bosch novels, and assuming the police procedures described are true to real life, one gets a good view of how crime cases are handled in quite a bit of detail.  Harry's approach to solving a crime is truly inspiring.  I have read about six Harry Bosch novels, and I think this one is the best one yet.
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|I thought that the story was dragged out for far too long. The writing was trite. There was no real action in the book. I got it because it was recommended on the web-site.
B007FG9LIE|3.0|I found this story to be interesting but also felt that at times it could have been sped up a bit. I liked the twist - very cool sci-fi idea.

B00ATDOVNK|3.0|As with most of G5s find an object games, the graphics and story behind the game are excellent. The player controls continue to get better each game. The disappointing aspect, and the sole reason why I rated a 3, is because like ALL of their games, they advertise it as a full game, but force you to purchase Part 2 of the &quot;series&quot; although they make no mention that this is Part 1 of X.

0887307280|4.0|It's very interesting, but a bit difficult to associate the contents with an actual situation.<br />I wish it was simpler for an amateur like me.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I really enjoy this game. It is very addicting, and I find myself playing it for hours. Thanks for the fun.
1594744769|5.0|I'm looking forward to the next in this series!! One of those books that you don't want to end.  I read it on Kindle and I didn't have any issues with the handwritten notes or pictures.
1481251880|3.0|While I can appreciate the wonderful writing and fully enjoyed the first half of the book, Hopeless is nothing more than a sweet a YA novel.  I don't know about anyone else, but since when do high school seniors act like Sky and Holder? Their interaction/dialog/sex are not at all believable (I guess this is why it's fiction!).  I would have been rivited to this story had our Hero and Heroine been adults, late 20s or so, working through some of the issues Sky and Holder confront.  Knowing they are barely 18 borders on creepy to me...
B00AREIAI8|5.0|great app!<br />this is a very intertwining game. first played this on the ipad. great for kindle as well.good for young kids as well as for adults. thanks!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I am having fun playing this game. It's easy to understand with the built in instructions. I hope my horse wins more competitions.
B004I744AS|4.0|Easy to use and is full featured. Anyone downloading this app should find it easy trouser as I did. Good app
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I am glad that I was able to get Facebook for my Kindle..I don't have to be on the computer to be able to be on facebook..My husband can be on the computer and at the same time, I can be on facebook, posting comments, etc.
B0011UJMK2|3.0|I chose this book because the description stated it was about a serial killer. I like crime drama/ psychological suspense. However, the first half of the book was really about how dismal life was in the Soviet Union during Stalin's regime. Not a bad story, but not what I was expecting.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Haven't read book one but I loved this one. I've seen the movie, but I think I will go back and read the first book.
B000S5AH8W|5.0|Alligator is a National album I didn't have till now.  I enjoy their music so much I never tire of hearing them over and over.  Saw them in concert last fall!  They were great!
B008XBCJ34|4.0|I like this movie mostly for the scenery and special effects, story is alright but could have been better .
B00A7H2NC4|5.0|Other than Peanuts and The Far Side, I have never read comics before.  Superheroes do not really appeal to me.  Still, I wanted to see what the hype was about comics.  I wanted to read something mature, so I chose Sin City.  I will  definitely read the next in the series.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|Cant get enough of this show; first season is a little short but only because it was a test to see how much market they could get.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Tough to put down.  Great suspense on what 2011 would be be without JFK killing.  Great job, a terrific read!
B009OYSFDM|5.0|Our family watched the first 9 episodes over Christmas break.  Loved the show and we are hooked.  Watching the show on Amazon was soooo much better than on HULU!
B0063GORYU|5.0|Love the tap. Faster way to finish the game but don't always rely on the game. Make your own move
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Cute story, well told, beautiful scenery and caracters<br />My grandchild will love it if my niece doesn't get it first.
0525423656|2.0|So I read Matched after my sister mentioned it. I was not in love with it, but it peaked my interest with all of the societal nuances and all of those new and different ideas. The \\"love triangle\\" that the 3 main characters found themselves in  also kept my attention. I was interested to see what was going to happen next. Crossed was a huge let down. I listened to it via audio book so I didn't have the confusion of who was speaking (as mentioned in other reviews),  but even this way my attention was drifting. At about 3/4 of the way through I found myself just letting it play so that it could be over. Sadly, this means I may never read Reached. I would definitely recommend some other series if  you are looking for something like Hunger games.
B004SVM7BW|4.0|I wanted to try this app as the previous PDF app was unfriendly as far as copying files into Word docs or notetaking software like Evernote.  This app does a great job of that.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|Love reading books on my Kindle.  Fifty Shades of Grey was a bit disappointing.  I really didn't plan on buy 3 books to read one story that wasn't really great.  I definitely don't know how they would make a movie out of this.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game free, funny and keeps u on your toes and in the air literally. Catching coins and being able to use them for boosters
B009VB97EY|2.0|This was very different than I thought; I was expecting something lighthearted but became rather depressed. The acting is also terrible!
B007BFSYMS|1.0|Great app. Can't exit or shut it down. This is really annoying. Had to shut my phone off in order for it to stop.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|What a great book, I really enjoyed it! Just when you think you know what is going to happen you are totally shocked!
0321885112|2.0|The book itself is beautiful. The illustrations are cute and whimsical. The author is clearly talented and imaginative. And, being somewhat on the creative side myself, it was fun to learn about the different pens, paper and styles the various featured illustrators featured in the book favored.<br /><br />But, those positives are also the negatives about this book. The main message of the book is that you don't have to be an artist to do sketchnotes. The author provides plenty of examples of basic drawing techniques using common shapes like squares, circles, and triangles. Again and again, the author declares that you do not need to be an artist, you just need to capture basic concepts using limited drawing techniques to create effective sketchnotes. On the surface, his claim is correct: anyone can draw basic shapes to capture the big concepts gleaned from a meeting or conference. The reality is that virtually no non-artistic types will bother to doodle concepts instead of writing down important details. This is proven by the book itself; all of the great examples in the book were drawn by professional graphic designers and other graphical design specialties.<br /><br />Therefore, the book's message is really just a self-celebratory pat on the back for illustrators and other creative types (myself included). The mistake of this book is to assume that right-brainers and left-brainers think alike. It has been my experience that, metaphorically speaking, right-brainers and left-brainers have almost completely different thinking styles. The financial quantitative analyst with a PhD in Mathematics is not going to sit through a conference on applied linear mathematics drawing cartoons about the key concepts of risk management algorithms.<br /><br />I have not yet viewed the author's video of live sketchnoting. The reason for this is another reason I can only give this book two stars. When I purchased the video edition of this book on Amazon, it was not apparent to me howI would be able to view the author's video. Only after receiving the book did I learn that the access code embedded in the back of the book requires an account on PeachPit.com. I am still debating whether or not to give yet another company my email address.<br /><br />If you are an artist (graphic design, illustrator, UI expert, or just an avid doodler), this may be for you. Although, you probably will not learn anything new.<br />If you are not an artist, do not attend many meetings or conferences, or simply work in an environment where every detail counts, this book is not for you.<br /><br />If the book were $10, I'd give it a three star rating. At $25, I give it a two.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|This is the best show on TV and has some of the best acting out there. Charlie Hunnam has really developed since season one. This show is so intense that you need time to decompress after each episode. This is very well cast and we are looking forward to purchasing season 5
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Self published books on Amazon are often a crap-shoot.  You read through piles of drek that should never have been published in hope of finding one good book.<br /><br />This is that book. It is, by far, the best Hard Science Fiction book I've read in years.  In The Martian, Astronaut Mark Watney is accidentally left for dead by his crewmates during a fierce storm.  Marooned on Mars, he has to use his intelligence and wit to survive and wait for a rescue ship, which at best would be over a year away.  The majority of the book is in a 'Log' format, with the main character chronicling what happened during each day.  Periodically the book cuts from the logbook format to a traditional narrative for the supporting characters in space and on Earth.<br /><br />This is very difficult format to write, but the author manages to pull it off masterfully.  As the main character recounts his triumphs and tragedies you can't help but be dragged into his struggle against the unforgiving Martian environment.  I never thought it would be possible to be kept up past my bedtime by story that involved a man trying to grow potatoes inside an inflatable tent.  The tension and drama are interspersed, where appropriate, by humor and wit.  A good example is when Mark realizes that by growing potatoes he has met the requirements for colonizing Mars (\\"Take that, Niel Armstrong!\\").<br /><br />The author did his homework and it shows.  The science is top notch and well researched.  The only obvious scientific inaccuracy I found was that the effects of a Martian storm were stronger than they are in real life by an order of magnitude.  This is acceptable as without the storm, Mark would not have been abandoned and the story couldn't happen.  The author manages to describe exceptionally complex engineering and chemical processes in a way that is both entertaining and understandable to the layman.<br /><br />Andy Weir managed to masterfully capture the spirit of NASA during its glory days, when there was no obstacle that could not be solved by an engineer with a slid rule, roll of duct tape, and a dash of creativity.<br /><br />I bought the Kindle edition, but I hope someday it will be released in paper form.  The hard cover has a place on my bookshelf next to Heinlein, Clarke, and Asimov.
B002ZG980U|5.0|Very few movies move the bar in an genre, this one did.  Much like the original \\"The Matrix\\" that came before it we're thrown into alternate realities but the way Nolan lead us through the maze with knowns and unknowns is probably what sets this movie apart.  I would encourage all movie-lovers to watch this movie for the sake of pure entertainment and storytelling first, and if you wish to revisit, then notice the subtleties of Nolan's cinematic devices.  The actors all do a fantastic job but the scene stealer is Tom Hardy.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love Walking Dead and need to catch up after missing season 3 before it starts again. Season 1 still the best, but keeps my interest.  Streamed very well over Verizon FIOS on PS3.
B004GVUPFE|4.0|Easy fun game.  The game involves strategy and quick thinking . Easily pass time while playing. Works on tablet and phone.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Changed my view on couple of topics in my life. Inspiring and Thought provoking.<br /><br />I just couldn't put it down.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I must have strange ears because I cannot find ANY headphones that stay in while working out - that is until I found these! They stay in perfectly while biking / running / walking / stretching / crunches etc. They are so light - its like you're not wearing anything at all. While I wouldn't use them on a non-working out basis (they're a bit goofy looking), I am totally fine using them at the gym - am I really trying to impress anyone there anyway? My first pair of these eventually got some sweat / water damage after about a year of use so I bought a 2nd replacement pair since I enjoyed them so much. I don't think I'll ever buy another pair of headphones for working out - these feel so good.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|There are too many steps required to finish a turn and what's the point of the game when the other person simply writes the letters with their finger? Maybe I got an idiot for my first attempt at the game but it didn't make me interested in playing anymore.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I chose the rating because it expresses the feelings I have for this book' very very good book I loved it
B007STBUIW|4.0|Absolutely one of the very best in shark drama, pure classic, audiences will love and also remember this one for a very long time to come, depite it's compititions.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This is a simple and easy to use sharpener.  You basically just slide the knife through unless its serrated.  For that it has a pull down rod that you use to sharpen that area.<br /><br />My only concern is the plastic seems fairly cheap, but it holds everything together well.  It's something that won't last forever, but as cheap as it is; it's a steal.<br /><br />If you're not an expert at sharpening your knives, but need a fine edge; i would recommend this as your product of choice.
B005LAIHYU|5.0|Absolutely on of the best in vampire movies yet, Benjamin Walker was great and fit the part for Abraham Lincoln; if you haven't seen it make it your next action horror flick and set back and enjoy.
1401235417|5.0|I'm comepletely new to comics, i recieved this one for christmas. I was able to dive right in. The art is really great. Even Harvey Bullock doesnt look completely disgusting! Batman is as much of a forensic dectective as he is a skilled figter, which IS What batman is! The stroy is very well done. I highly recomend it, and i dont know a thing about comics!
B003YL4LYI|3.0|Well, it had to be read, because of the unfinished stories leading up to this book. BUT, oh my goodness, how disappointing. The stories led nowhere. All the main characters die.
B008XG1X18|3.0|went I look @ stuff and I hit the wrong thing I hit back buttons the freeze on a lot hats it lots!&iexcl;!!!!!!!!!!
1400095204|4.0|If you are looking for a good novel about Africa, Half of a yellow sun is definitely for you.  This is one of the best African novels written by the Nigerian Author Chamamanda Adichie.  The title of the book comes from the Biafran flag.  The book portrays the tumultuous lives of five characters and how their lives intertwined during the Nigeria-Biafra war of the 1960's.  All the political events are factually true.  The characters consist of Ugwu, a loyal house boy for a professor, a university professor, Olanna, the professor's mistress, Richard, a white British expat & Kaniene, Olanna's twin sister. I really enjoyed the characters in the story. They were easy to identify with and very real. This book is definitely a page turner. It's more than a war novel. It's about love, loyalty, betrayal, interracial r/ship, loyalty & moral obligation.  Must READ
B0076DELIG|5.0|This story kept me wanting to come back to read more and more. If you like detective stories, this will keep you entertained!
B008JGSM6G|3.0|Pretty much a no brainer!  Glad I didn't pay for it. It would be perfect for a five or six year old.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a really fun app. I wasn't sure at first about it but I gave it a chance and glad I did. I have always loved horses but could never have one. Now I do. Give it a try. Hey if you don't like it delete it. No harm done.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is the most awesome book ever! Especially the huge crazy ending! I totally did not see it coming. You have to read. This book is amazing! :)
B002RKSZS0|4.0|If you like Jane Austen, you will enjoy this one too. Simple, yet kept me very engaged and always looking forward to picking the book up again for more reading time!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I started reading the hunger games trilogy to pass the time for what I presumed would he a week or two. That was yesterday, and now I'm left with , longing isn't the right word but it's the first that comes to mind. I prefer being provoked into thought rather than handed a daintily wrapped mess with a bow on it; at least I always thought I did until this series gripped me like no other sparsely written book for youth has. The only affirmative statement that can be made at the end of it all is that I will be keeping my eye out for new releases from Mrs. Collins.
B00340ESIS|4.0|This book is the bible for anyone who wants to understand the craft and skills necessary to be a successful screen writer.

B00ATDOVNK|3.0|I chose to download this game for my grandson because it did not seem to be violent with shooting and death.  The Wraiths did scare him at first until he got used to the game.
B000WCDI5K|1.0|I know that it was an international shipping and I didnt expect it to be perfect but the case is completely crushed.  I would have even taken it if the front was totally shattered but its the ENTIRE box... Im not big on complaining on the internet but theyre my favorite band and it makes me upset the product was crushed.
0761169253|2.0|This is a little book (slightly larger than a CD case), containing few words, many garish call-outs, some pedestrian black and white photographs, and too many unattractive scribbles faking as art (I suppose). It sports a clever title, but bears little substance. The word sophomoric comes to mind for most of it. It is written in a rather tacky and loose conversational style. It seems more like a comic book (excuse me, graphic novel) than a real book. A real book features text, and lots of it, unless it is an art book. Yet it was a New York Times Best-seller. This is puzzling and a bit unsettling. One hopes that the mediocre or subpar will be ignored or patted on the head, but not applauded. And yet, we should remember the words of The Preacher:<br /><br />I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all (Ecclesiastes 9:11, KJV).<br /><br />The author, who looks to be a hipster in his twenties, is said to be a writer and artist who has edited a volume of poetry and has, of course, appeared on a few television programs. Yes, you can reach him on-line. Being distant from most popular culture, I knew nothing of him, spare the book itself. What people take to be his charm is beyond me. I find little reason to be interested in Austin Kleon. His art found on line looks crayon-like and childish. This book was bought as a curiosity (which did, after all, kill the cat) and as part of my endless and endlessly frustrating and fascinating quest to comprehend American culture. In any case, it was a best-seller, and I could read it in about an hour--unlike the vast majority of my books.<br /><br />Some books are worth reading and re-reading because of their objective worth, however popular or unpopular they may be. For example, I have read C.S. Lewis's, The Abolition of Man about a dozen times since 1977. Other books should be read even if they are not worth reading in themselves--like Steal Like an Artist. This is because of what they tell us about the times. But popularity does not necessarily mean profundity, and one does not determine truth by counting noses or by logging unique hits on websites. This book's popularity tells us that people snatch up off-handed, graphically-ugly, but oh-so-trendy books, especially if they have a self-help element. Does not everyone want to be an \\"artist\\"?<br /><br />Kleon's \\"ten things about being creative\\" are mostly mundane, unoriginal, and uncreative. This is ironic, since the subtitle is \\"10 Things That No One Told You About Being Creative.\\" In fact, many have told us \\"these things.\\" But there are a few insights (mostly quotations from noteworthy authors) sprinkled about in the comic book mire. But the theme of the title (artistic theft) is worth pondering, since art involves imitation. Kleon quotes (but does not reference) Picasso's statement, \\"Art is theft.\\" However, given Kleon's abbreviated and elliptical style, important distinctions are not made sufficiently. No artist is absolutely original, spare God (but Kleon avoids this). Nevertheless, all artists need to find their own voice, which, for the best artists in any field, goes beyond any synthesis or aping of previous influences. To use an overused word, that is what makes for authenticity in art. Thus, when I hear Peter Br&ouml;tzmann play tenor saxophone, I hear a bit of Sonny Rollins, John Coltrane, and Eric Dolphy. A more perceptive listener would hear other saxophonic sensibilities. But more than hearing a mere combination of influences, I hear Peter Brotzmann himself. Sadly, Steal Like an Artist has little say about music (except that the author likes to play guitar on the side) and nothing to say about jazz, one of the most creative art forms. Nevertheless, Kleon's rudimental point stands, and serves perhaps to tame the pride of those who refuseto recognize and imitate artistic excellence outside of themselves. Authenticity is not egocentricity.<br /><br />The rest of Kleon's advice, such as \\"Write the Book You Want to Read,\\" is either pedestrian or a bit quirky, such as \\"I Google everything.\\" The hierarchy of appearance in Google does not correlate well with the hierarchy of real value, but we have none of that. Steal Like an Artist offers no arresting insights or shrewd observations--at least to my mind. Maybe a younger, less experienced reader would be better served, if not ennobled. But neither does it advocate self-destructive or nihilistic practices, so often found in contemporary artists, such as Lady Gaga. Kleon seems like a rather tame Bohemian (unless he is hiding something), who somehow got a book (or near book) published. It could have been worse.<br /><br />That this book is a best-seller is an indictment of our cultural superficiality and propensity for over-simplification. For far better advice on the meaning of art and art-making, read Francis Schaeffer Art and the Bible, 2nd ed. (InterVarsity, 2006), Phillip Graham Ryken, Art for God's Sake (P&R Publishing, 2006), and the secular work Art and Fear by David Bayles and Ted Orland (Image Continuum Press, 2001). Art is part of what makes us human, so we should take it far more seriously than Steal Like an Artist.to recognize and imitate artistic excellence outside of themselves.

Unfortunetly, the quality of the vinyl used in this boxset does not match the quality of this band. What a pitty! Só I am asking, with all my heart, for Yoko, Olivia, Paul and Ringo don't let this happen again. Select the best vinyl pressing factory in the world for future releases. The Beatles deserve that. We, their fans, too. Price should not be the goal. Love you guys!

B005Q1W10A|1.0|In England I've read that Julian Fellows, the creator and writer of \\"Downton Abbey\\", has been accused of plagiarizing from \\"Little Women\\"  among other works of literature.  I have thought those claims rather weak, but in this Season especially I really do think he is at least inspired by Margaret Mitchell's \\"Gone With The Wind.\\"  For example:  Downton Abbey and the struggle to save it echoes Tara in Gone With The Wind.  However, in Gone With The Wind Scarlett has to save Tara because the War Between the States ravaged the area and the carpetbaggers are raising the property taxes.  Those reasons are more compelling than just mismanagement which seems to be the recurring theme in Downton Abbey.  The scene in Season Two wherein Mary wakes up early to meet Cousin Matthew at the train before he leaves a day earlier than expected, very much echoes the scene in Gone With the Wind where Scarlett meets Ashley early in Atlanta before he leaves after Christmas and gives him his gold sash as a Christmas present.  In both instances, the men make the girls promise to take care of their loved ones in case they don't return from war.  Also, in Gone With the Wind Scarlett's father is unable to fight for the Confederacy because of his knee and in Downton Abbey Season Two, early on, the father is troubled by the fact that his colonel title is more for morale boosting rather than for any real military action.  Furthermore, in Season Two there is debate about whether or not to allow the soldiers to stay at Downton for convalescing and recuperation purposes.  Which is similar to Tara after the war when they are feeding the soldiers on their way back home.  In both \\"Downton Abbey\\" and \\"Gone With The Wind\\" the main families consist of three sisters and no brothers.  Mary is the \\"Downton Abbey\\" version of Scarlett O'Hara and she's a mighty pathetic subsitute.  (Isn't it just a coincidence that she's also dark haired and fair complected like Scarlett?)  For she doesn't ever break out of the bounds of her class, while Scarlett was always pushing the limit yet remaining dignified throughout it all. The scene where Mary is bidding goodbye to Sir Richard the newspaperman sounded very much like Rhett Butler talking to Scarlett as he tells her all about how they are just alike, cold and heartless but a good team.  While in Gone With The Wind, Scarlett does the nursing, in Downton Abbey it is Sybill the younger sister who does the nursing.  I admit, nursing is something to be expected in any war, but with all of the other similarities between \\"Downton Abbey\\" and \\"Gone With The Wind\\" it just adds to the thought that Julian Fellows is more inspired by \\"Gone With The Wind\\" than he probably realizes himself.  And the fact that \\"Downton Abbey\\" has been so successful in the U.S. as well as in Britain shows more than anything how powerful a story Margaret Mitchell developed in \\"Gone With The Wind\\", for if even a less compelling knockoff as Downton can make it, what does that say about the power of the original story?bounds of her class, while Scarlett was always pushing the limit yet remaining dignified throughout it all.

B005LAIHZY|2.0|I was expecting another Tangled; boy, was I mistaken.  Maybe it's because this is Pixar and not Disney outright, but I didn't think that would make a difference.  The music isn't as good, and the second half of the movie dragged quite a bit. I thought the story line was a bit outlandish, even for a fairy tale, and somewhat confusing.  I'd recommend renting this one first to make sure you like it - wish I had done so & saved the $20.<br /><br />P.S. My daughter is 2 1/2, and she was fine with the \\"scary\\" scenes.

B0097GVJWQ|1.0|This could have been a 4-star rating, but when the game glitches at the penultimate puzzle (the runes) and it is impossible to reach the denouement, it is like reading a murder mystery for a week only to discover that the last chapter with the Big Reveal has been omitted. Big Fish customers - you have been warned.

0307386171|4.0|Some critics have described McEwan's Chesil Beach as a \\"perfect novel.\\" I think it's McEwan's ending that comes up short. McEwan is clearly a master of prose and his easy-to-read writing style simply flows. He pares down his sparse narrative, omitting unnecessary details, to focus his novel on the important nuances between  marital partners in their interactions over a few disasterous  hours that follow their wedding. He builds up our suspense over the outcome of the conflict we see developing and only then flashes back to fill us in on how they got to this point. Significantly, both partners are sexually inexperienced because McEwan choses a time in the early 1960's, before the sexual revolution.<br /><br />  McEwan's ending disappoints because it focuses on only one of his two characters. Our expectations are raised by his equal character development of the two partners throughout the novel. In earlier chapters we see McEwan take a  very balanced approach to both of his partners. He carefully delegates equal time to work out and  describe  each partner's thoughts, expectations, and background. McEwan's balanced approach in contrasting them to set up the conflict is his forte. It beautifully succeeds in pointing out the couple's misperceptions and the tremendous communications gap this couple just can't bridge.  Because we see  just how different their perceptions, understandings, and expectations are, we can accept McEwan's conclusion that love fails to conquer all and romantic love is insufficient to resolve this  couple's troubles.<br /><br /> In contrast, McEwan's ending  focuses almost exclusively and unilaterally on the ensuing effects of that disasterous first time wedding night encounter on the male partner. He fails to follow through with his female character. Instead, McEwan simply choses to end his novel and leaves us hanging. He essentially abandons developing Florence's fate in intimate relationship to leave this outcome up to his readers' imaginations. Everything we learn is limited to Florence's professional successes as a violinist with a hint of relationship regrets tossed in as she reflects on what is missing. This novel could have been that critic's  \\"perfect novel\\" had McEwan also worked out the long-term effect on his female character. As it stands, there's a hint of \\"unfinished\\" in McEwan's ending.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|A very good and exciting book.<br />Can't wait to read the second book of this trilogy.<br />I give it a 5 stars.

B00A6HHJ9C|5.0|Transition is the amazing new album by Steve Lukather that completes a trilogy of extremely high quality solo albums over the last few years from one of the greatest musicians in the world. Steve Lukather has always been known as a great guitarist but as his career has progressed his solo albums have also shown him to be an amazing songwriter and producer with the ability to make deep albums full of quality music. Transition delivers on all we expect from Steve Lukather and the list of musicians who perform on this album is awesome including appearances by Nathan East and Lee Sklar on bass, Greg Bissonette and Chad Smith on drums, Phil Collen on backing vocals, and Lenny Castro on percussion. Highlights include the intense groove of \\"Creep Motel\\", the gorgeous piano ballad \\"Once Again\\", the progressive riffs and killer keyboard stabs of \\"Transition\\", and the trademark emotional ballad of \\"Last Man Standing\\". Production was handled by Luke himself and CJ Vanston so you can be confident the sound of this album is stunning and layered with all intruments having their place in the mix. Transition is yet another amazing solo album from Steve Lukather that I can easily recommend to his fans and really adds to his already stellar musical legacy.

B004LWZWBU|5.0|Superb cast. Steve Martin, Owen Wilson, and Jack Black at some of their best performances. The scenery is amazing. From the bayous, to the tundra and snow of the Alaskan Islands.<br /><br />This is a movie about the competition between three `birders', people who value sighting bird species over their own personal lives. The thing is, it's not. It's about how their passion of `birding' affects their personal lives...cementing them, and losing them.<br /><br />I know you have read all the reviews already. All I can say, is this small film, is a big movie. Please watch it.

0525952926|3.0|I have read and liked all of Ken Follett's historical novels including this one, but wish he would stick with his wonderfully exciting and historically detailed story-lines and not add the embarrassingly juvenile, self-conscious and contrived sex scenes that totally spoil this book - Follett really cannot write the seamy stuff and one is embarrassed for him to see him try.

B004LWZWGK|5.0|I thought the movie had great twists and turns, a great plot and also the action was good. Is it just me though or does Batman always seem to get his butt kicked. One thing I didn't like in the movie was CatWoman. I think she was no where near as good as Michelle Pheiffer.<br /><br />I thought Tom Hardy played a good Bane, I liked him in Warrior as well. This movie was a great ending to the trilogy, but I wished they would have made another in the series. This was my favorite of the 3 movies in the series. I wonder if people would have liked The Dark Knight Rises as much as they did if Heath Ledger wouldn't have died around the time it came out? Don't get me wrong all three are great and I thought Heath played a better joker than Jack but I enjoyed the last of the trilogy the most.
B00028HBKC|5.0|great powerful movie tells how Jesus went thru the suffering for us to show us Hos love to save the world.
B008518MOW|5.0|Of the 3 MIB movies this is my second favorite now, it was entertaining and had good 3d as well. I also thought the main villian was good. Don't know what else to say about this movie other than give it a watch. I don't know if it was better than the original but often sequels never are. 3D has some great depth and a few pop out moments throughout the movie.

B0099116AY|5.0|Movie has a good basic plot and two great actors, kind of weird in my opinion having two older people play a role about sex in my opinion but that's what made the movie good also. Plot had funny parts, some sad parts and just some overall great acting without over acting like we see sometimes today.

B009ANP48G|5.0|My wife and I like dancing movies and shows (i.e. So You Think You Can Dance) and after being dissapointed with Step Up 3d I didn't know what to expect of this movie until I watched it. The main girl in the movie started her career first on the Fox TV show SYTYCD and she is hot. The dancing throughout the movie was great, it had the kind of music I like and the plot was much better than step up 3. My previous favorite was Step Up 2 but I think after watching this one, Step Up Revolution is now my favorite. The last 10-15 minutes of the movie are by far the best of the series.<br /><br />A side note, I have a 3d projector with a 125&#34; electric screen and the 3d in this movie was actually really good, nothing cheesy like in some 3d movies and the 3d effects were worthwhile. Obviously not the best 3d effects I seen, but much better than some of the movies I seen lately.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|This cover is simply lovely. It's light weight and fits my Kindle Fire in snug and secure manner. The cover seems durable and does not add bulk or weight to my Kindle. It's just like carrying around a paperback novel. My only complaint is the cover does not close completely. Once it's closed, the top is propped open just a tad. It's not a deal breaker, but it does bug me from time to time to see the cover not lay completely flat against the screen. Oh well, at least when I slide my Kindle onto a library shelf, it seems to vanish with all the other books, looking elegant and inconspicuous among my paper novels. I've even had a few compliments when people discover my Kindle in disguise.

B00AEJM6H2|3.0|You can waste too much time with this game.  The game is addictive and pointless - only get if free.
B009S2U77C|4.0|3rd release from Washington D.C. couple duo (Ian MacKaye & Amy Farina) with a legendary<br />  background (Fugazi, Minor Threat, Embrace, the Warmers).  Eclectic, boy/girl indie rock that<br />  combines a distinct sense of melody with start-stop jump rhythmic breaks, big drums, urgently<br />  jagged guitar chords and vocal harmonies.  The lyrics address social injustice; the music reflects<br />  the duality of life's chaos and joy--survival of the aware.  For the most part, it's not anything<br />  you'll hum along to, but the energy is infectious and moving.  Sometimes reminiscent of the<br />  Pixies, Pinback, Mission Of Burma, Belly, Les Savy Fav.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|Hilarious - the graphics and sound make this an enjoyable game.  Watching the back story will make you laugh out loud.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great book. I loved it. It was a beautiful love story.<br />I am super excited for the movie and I hope that the book will come to life even more.<br />This book was completely captivating, so much that in my -20° weather I wanted to put on my shorts and be at the beach.

B0069G5Z9K|5.0|fun and addicting.  Haven't found a game this good in quite a while.  I really like it a lot.  Lots of fun.
B004L35GAQ|5.0|I'm not a big fan of today's &#34;indie&#34; style music.  A lot of it simply isn't aggressive or punchy enough for me to enjoy, so I often end up dablling in genres like metal and punk to get the agressive, catchy music that I desire.  Well, if you're a pop fan, rock fan or general music snob like myself, it will be hard for you to resist this album.<br /><br />The album seems to have something for everyone.  The band is extremely musically diverse and the music simply lacks the pretense that so many bands have these days.  These guys are very stylized much like many hipster bands, but they go straight to the point.  These guys rock out, and they don't shun catchy hooks.  They embrace them.  These guys aren't above knocking you on the floor with a killer chorus, and this album is full of them.  Orginal and odd enough for a hipster, and rocking and catchy enough for someone who just wants to enjoy good, fun music.  The music is fun and accessible like a good pop band but deep in many ways, including odd lyrics, strange musical accents in odd places, and a lot of attention to details in production.  Regarding production, the album sounds AWESOME in my car or in the house, but it's not so produced that it lacks passion.<br /><br />You'll really just have to hear it for yourself to see what I'm saying.  If you've heard a couple of their songs and like what you hear, then there's no reason you shoud hesitate buying the album.  The whole band rocks, the singer is amazing, and best of all, these guys have something SO many bands lack these days - A sense of humor.  Again, you'll have to hear it to see what I'm saying.  My favorite tracks are &#34;Wake Up&#34;, &#34;Burn it Down&#34; and &#34;Not Your Fault&#34;.  But trust me there is hardly a weak tune on the album.  This band is truly an anomaly in the world of popular music.  My grilfriend likes them, my Mom does, and my dog does too.  Buy it.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|This is rated by many to be perhaps the best Thermal Compound that can be bought. So far I have not broken it in (this takes quite some time) but once broken in it will keep your computer at a lower temperature in high performance mode than most other thermal compounds.<br /><br />Overall this compound is great because it is very easy to apply (it gives you a website which has detailed instructions) and has enough for several uses.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Blood Song by Anthony Ryan is currently one of the highest rated and new I might add, fantasy book on Amazon. At the moment of this review, the book has managed to maintain an average of 5 stars with over 685 user reviews! That almost never happens. What's the other amazing thing? This author is the new kid on the block! He's only written one other short book but suffice it to say, Blood Song will be this author's claim to fame and I'm also sure he will have one heck of a career if he continues to write like this. After completion of this book, do I personally think it deserves a 5 star review? Absolutely. But here is one big caveat. In order to enjoy this book, you will need to be a very patient reader, especially if you are the type to expect heavy action from the beginning and it not stopping till the very end. If you like a story that is well thought out and well written, Blood Song will satisfy you.<br /><br />The story revolves around a young protagonist by the name of Vaelin Al Sorna. At a young age, Vaelin has been sent to the Sixth Order, seemingly being abandoned by his father, who is the infamous Battle Lord to King Janus. With his time in the Sixth Order (think of warrior monks who defends and puts the Realm's religion first before the Kingdom), Vaelin trains with other boys of his age and as time goes by, his tale of deeds and heroics begin to grow until he is one of the most feared warrior in the land. 95% of the book is told as a flashback. Right in the beginning, you learn that Vaelin has been captured and being transferred to another island. Vernier is a chronicler/scribe to the emperor who is accompanying Vaelin on his trip and it is during their time on the ship that Vaelin Al Sorna tells the chronicler of his tale and how his legend came to be.<br /><br />I like the story in Blood Song although like I mentioned earlier, it does take a while for things to pick up. About 30-35 percent of the book in the beginning is dedicated to Vaelin's time training in the Sixth Order with his other brothers. While things do move slowly here, it does set the backdrop for things to come. It talks about the Faith, the Beyond and the Dark. While Blood Song can't be considered a dark fantasy, the setting here seems grimy and the author does well in painting a picture for us as there will be a lot of deaths.<br /><br />The main characters in Blood Song consists mainly of Vaelin, his band of brothers of the Sixth Order (of course, each of them have a different personality to separate them apart) and his masters and Aspect of the various Order faction. However, the story is focused mainly on Vaelin and is told entirely through his eyes. He's a likable character with a strong sense of justice but as always, things aren't that easy for him. As the killings pile up, it's harder each time for Vaelin to make that distinction between good and evil. The good news is that the author does not overdo the character self-loathing part. Although Vaelin does show remorse at times and questions his actions, the author doesn't repeat things over and over again. This is one thing that can drive a reader mad having to read about the main protagonist feeling sorry for himself/herself because they committed an act they shouldn't have over and over again throughout each chapter. The main character just trudges along and continues to do things because life goes on! However, you still sense the pain and torture that goes on within Vaelin.<br /><br />What I'm most shocked about with Blood Song is the writing. There's just no way I can believe this author is new to writing. I immediately picked up after a couple chapters of reading that this author writes like a pro. In fact, I'm willing to bet he writes better than many other lesser known authors who have more book titles under their belt. I just can't get the thought out of my head that the author must have had a secret pen name in the past where he's undoubtedly written fantasy books prior to this! Hiswriting just seems too mature for someone whose only got one other book under his belt. The other thing I want to point out is that although there were many slow moving parts in Blood Song, I never once found myself wanting to quit or skipping over parts. Again, I owe this to the author's brilliant writing style. The book just flows smoothly from one chapter to the next. One of the main complaints from many reviews is the amount of grammatical and punctuation errors. Honestly, once I was engaged in the book, while I did notice some of those errors, it did nothing to hinder the experience for me.<br /><br />One big dislike I have with Vaelin is how I see him as a bit overrated. No doubt he is a strong warrior but it seems as if him just being the son of the famous Battle Lord did all the work for him early on. It's only obvious that I won't reveal spoilers here but suffice it to say, some of Vaelin's battles just seems a bit lackluster in the beginning and it's only due to rumors does his legend continues to grow. This obviously isn't always necessarily so but it does happen enough for me to notice them. During battles, the author paints just enough of a picture in your mind of the battle scene without really having to bore you with the intricate details. Some veteran readers no doubt would have loved for the author to spend more time fleshing out the fight scenes and I personally think this can be an improvement in his next book.<br /><br />All in all, I'm left pretty breathless after completing Blood Song. I initially thought this was a stand alone novel but apparently, the story continues and I can't wait for the next in the series. I just hope the author can continue to show off his amazing writing skills. There are some minor things that I wish the author can improve on but they are in the minority and not worth mentioning here. All I know is that we have witnessed a special author and series in the making.

B008MG1E4A|3.0|NOT THE BEST  I'VE READ. NOT SURE I WOULD RECOMMEND IT.NOT SURD WHAT I WAS EXPECTING.Out t was just ok
B007712XAU|5.0|I'd not seen this series on tv, but heard that a lot of people love it. As it turns out, I do too. Beautiful clothing, interior and exterior shots, great acting and music. What more could you ask for? Everyone always thinks about what a romantic time period it was in the early 1900s.......yes.....for the wealthy. Downton Abbey points out what life was like for the people who had to work for a living, as well as the wealthy. And even though the &#34;help&#34; in Downton Abbey worked very hard, they also had lives, dreams, and fun as well.<br />And, like in every place of employment, you have lots of gossip to keep life interesting! (Who CAN you trust?!!) Downton Abbey makes me want to sit and sip tea, and pretend I'm a lady......I want Season 3 for my Birthday!
B0042U94UQ|5.0|Original DVD was scratched beyond use.  This one arrived packaged well and timely.  The price was great and we still love the movie.
B0091REZMW|4.0|My kids and I love this app. We take turns playing.  It's frustrating though that if you have to reset your kindle the game resets and you start over
B000SVZIR6|5.0|This is the story of Siam, now Thailand, at the time of the Empire building by England and France. India had already become British, Viet Nam was French Indochina and Burma was under British economic control. This is a more serious movie than the Yule Brenner make called The King and I.<br />This is an entertaining and well done film with a bit of history thrown in. As a fan of Jodie Foster, I found her acting very good as usual.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|Can't get enough of Sheldon and the gang. Love the series!!!! Best comedy show in years. Love it, love it!
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|I had watched Contact a couple of times and enjoyed it very much. I had never seen Contact in the theater or in bl-ray. I bought the bl-ray edition, and it is spectacular.  The color and detail is amazing. This is based on a book by Carl Sagan whose TV program I watched when I was younger. It really shaped much of my ideas about space and the possibility of life elsewhere. This is a well done film and great entertainment.

B0053O89KG|5.0|This is one of the best shows on television, in my opinion.  There's action, comedy, something for everyone.  I have watched this show since day one and have all the seasons on DVD and still watch them over and over.  Love this show!!  It deserves a 5-star rating.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Downton Abbey is an excellent series. The characters are wonderful and acting is great. We cannot wait until the next episode each week. The story line, sets and costuming is very well done. So much better than some of todays meaningless programs.

B009NQKPUW|4.0|This is an excellent sci-fi movie.  It helps if you saw Alien first.  This movie answers some questions I had about Alien.  I enjoyed it and it left the door open for another movie.  Could be a series coming like Alien.
B006LSZECO|4.0|The book is very well written and suspenseful. The first person chapters were great.  However, I could have done with a little less foul language and explicit sex information.  I don't conider myself a prude, but it was too much.It certainly kept me interested.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love the storyline this season!  It's keeping me guessing!  :)  Can't wait to see the next episode and what's coming next!
B00447L4KA|4.0|This is an interesting modernized adaptation of Shakespeare's &#34;Taming of the Shrew&#34; with a great cast. I like how they incorporate all of the characters [with their original names for the most part] in a high school setting, and the dynamics of the cast. The English teacher also mentions Shakespearean sonnets in class, tying in the story's roots. Comical, romantic, funny.

030758836X|2.0|This story is Amazing until you hit the last page and realize how sorely lacking the ending is.  It started out great.  Flynn's ability to sum up the male and female psyche is so dead-on it took my breath away.  But that ending took this book from stellar to extremely disappointing.  The publisher had to have left a few chapters out. I can't fathom anyone dropping a story so abruptly.  Don't waste your time.  Bad girl, bad.
B005LAIGPA|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. Most movies of today are shallow and boring and lack much of a meaningful plot. This movie has the intrigue of extra-psychic abilities along with a mysterious origin story... It made me cry, it made me laugh, and most of all, it made me think.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|A slow start with a surprising twist. This one will never be a classic, but it's a good \\"bad\\" book.
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|Dredd was much better than I had hoped. It was truer to the source material than Stalone's 1995 attempt. I really respect Karl Urban for not insisting on face time...I am pretty sure he did not even take off his helmet. The tail was visceral and to the point. As I watched it I thought that this would be far more successful as an ongoing TV series than a series of movies.<br /><br />Amazon was having technical difficulties when I was attempting to watch this or anything off my prime services but I will not hold that against Dredd.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Fun game that will keep you busy for hours.  Plenty of levels to navigate through. I would recommend to anyone.
1606995359|5.0|Scrooge McDuck is my favorite character to come out of the Disney studios via the brilliant mind of Carl Barks. The idea of a wealthy person putting their money in a large money bin rather than investing it is just so comical, along with his miserly habits such as finding a discarded newspaper in a park bench so he doesn't have to buy one. Through it all, however, Scrooge is on the level, and it is clear his wealth was obtained honestly. Scrooge has many adventures, and hopefully more will follow this edition. I began loving the Uncle Scrooge stories on 10¢ pulp paper comic books in the 1950's, and am so glad to see they are being reprinted in a more permanent form so I can share them with my grandkids.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|My grandaughter and I love this game, it is a lot of fun and being a hairdresser I enjoy it even more.
B000002ADT|5.0|This is the seminal Miles recording of all human and jazzoid time.<br /><br />Whether you are a neophyte or a jazz purist, this is the one recording that should be that essential item in your collection. It is a must.<br /><br />Besides the wondrous Miles Davis, this is a session of assembled royalty and features some of the finest cats who ever picked up their respective instruments: Cannonball Adderly, Paul Chambers, Wynton Kelly, James Cobb, Bill Evans, and John Coltrane! Are you kidding me?<br /><br />From the very first bars of \\"So What\\" you are pulled into this sonic, moody world of supreme jazz sorcery where Miles Davis is the prime conjurer and conduit, wizard and hypnotist... and the spell is never quite broken.<br /><br />Discovering this collection of compositions is tantamount to being an ignorant explorer who discovers a Whole New World.<br /><br />There are only six pieces contained here and amazingly each presents a classic example of stellar musicianship and works that say so much, that bring such JOY, life and atmosphere.  This is every aspect of the human condition, given a voice, a tone, and a rhythm. Beyond just being a masterpiece, this is a masterclass of vivid, cool, pristine, beautiful, relaxing, complex, simple, soulful music. It is the essence of Miles' genius.  It is why we still speak his name.<br /><br />Yes, it is Kind of Blue, and kinda GLORIOUS, too.<br /><br />One.

B0014D6PCO|5.0|Chris Nolan reboots the Batman story with a darker tone and an amazing cast. Considered one of the best films of that year, it is a must see for any movie lover.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I love this book. It is full of emotions. I did not want to put it down. It is a must read.
B007BFSYMS|4.0|its a good app for white noise. I got it a FAOTD basically. It has many controls, settings, sounds probably one of the top sleeping apps I have downloaded
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It is a great game if you love horses even if you don't like them.also the picture and graphics are sick
B0077PBPJ6|5.0|What can I say ???  I got the book as always on best sellers list but didnt get around to reading it.....sooooo I watched the DVD and found the story moving and the trench scenes quite realistic.  Excellent heartfelt performances from Redmayne, Madden and Mawle and the story had a good flow to it.  The sex scene would suit European viewers more than prudish Americans.  Kind of reminds me of the Aussie movie \\"Beneath Hill 60\\" and Canadian \\"Passhandaele\\" movies which have similar themes an I thought both made a good fist of portraying life in the WW1 trenches and peaked my curiosity in this subject.  Would recommend all of them.
B00AQMSJI2|5.0|great way to pass the time, I love it! I especially like expanding my territory and playing treasure island to win prizes :)

B005CRQ4GU|5.0|The greatest of all the books that I have read! I suggest that everyone reads this book series cause it rules
B006VFLIYK|4.0|I really like David Baldacci's books.  He always keeps you in suspense to the very end of the book.  Easy read and relaxing.  I have read and listen to many of his books.  Will probably read them all.
B004RKXNDU|5.0|Easy read. Ending of movie version better than book. Very British in characters and plot. If you are into Cold War spy thrillers. This is a great book.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|i found this book to be amazing to the point of reading it almost non-stop for two days straight until i finished. (that almost beats the record made by the hunger game which i finished in the course of one long school night and regretted for one extremely tiring school day) i didnt really know what to expect out of this book before finally being able to read the first page, and though i could tell that it would be more meaningful and insightful than all but one of the books that ive ever read, both fiction and non-fiction, i still didnt know my feelings for it. now that i have spent all of my time for the past two days reading and absorbing every last bit of the book that i could grab, i do realize what made me love it so much; it was different. true there are many many love stories in the world and many other stories that make you feel a roller coaster of emotions and that make you think about life and death and the true purposes of everything, including the universe itself, but never have i seen/read something that can combine all of these properties into one being so seamlessly ever before in my life along with so many other indescribable traits of a novel and story, and never before this book have i ever been able to describe something so meaningful in simply one word:  Okay.

Even the free version is wonderful!!!  You can mix and match sounds and save your own combinations.  A definite must try if your looking for a really helpful way to fall asleep!
B004L49K20|5.0|Duran Duran has been my favorite band since the early 80's.  This recording is a good as any they have performed.  I like every track on this CD.  I can't say I like all of their music,(i.e. Astro....) but this is worth it!  The best since RIO in my opinion.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|Omg this game is the best next game. It is just like Mario brother by but with a lepracon. I don't think I spelt that right......Anyways.......Good game get it
B005LAII80|5.0|For starters, I am a huge JD fan, which made me excited and also worried about this second attempt at bringing him and his world to the big screen.  Dredd stands as a stark example of how clear storytelling and a simple plot can make an extraordinary film.  The laughable Stallone film tried to shoe horn in too many concepts from the 30+ year history of the character.  Dredd, on the other hand, focused purely on the meat of the character, giving only small glimpses of the sprawling universe he inhabits.<br /><br />Judge Dredd may seem hollow and robotic to new comers, but this is exactly why his character is so beloved.  The film makers do a great service to the character, and Karl Urban's performance helps to solidify this.  I can only smile when reading irate reviews hammering the lack of character development and robotic acting.  The reviewers obviously don't understand.  There is a reason why JD never takes his helmet off.  He is meant to be faceless.  He is the one solid and reliable rock in the sea of crazy that is the far future.<br /><br />The one drawback is that this film is very violent, and if you aren't prepared for it you will be turned off fairly quickly.  It also makes great use of slow motion to capture and juxtapose the action from different viewpoints.  This gives the action scenes a strange pace, but I felt it to be perfectly suited to the plot.  It only felt overdone during a couple of sequences.<br /><br />Speaking of plot, this film has taken some knocks because of a thin plot.  I find this funny considering how paper thin most movie plots are when compared to novels and comics.  The Hobbit is a movie about a long journey, and is great because of what happens along the way and what obstacles they have to overcome.  This movie is essentially a day in the life of Judge Dredd, and is about his journey to stop and apprehend a gang leader.  It is great because of what happens along the way and what obstacles he must overcome.  A simple, clearly stated plot with great story telling wrapped around it is what you will find in this film if you give it a chance.  I did, even with my fear of past failures, and I loved it.<br /><br />I don't like the Ultraviolet service, but this disc also has an iTunes compatible download.  If there is a drawback, then it is that all of these are crammed onto a single disc instead of giving us a separate disc for the Blu Ray and the digital download. Also, having no DVD version available in the set was a bit of a downer since I like to loan mine out to friends to get them hooked.  The digital download worked fine for me, though, and the BR ran perfectly in my 1st generation PS3.ed plot with great story telling wrapped around it is what you will find in this film if you give it a chance.

0345803485|5.0|I bought this thru Amazon for my daughter as when it came out was unavailable in stores nowhere, sold out, so popular first in the series.As for the book itself, ask her, I am not an avid reader unless its a tech manual.Amazon always comes through even on hard to find items.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|My daughters read &#34;Still Alice&#34; and raved about it.  Since they often don't have the same taste in books that I have, I was leery about purchasing this book.  But they were absolutely right.  It is beautifully written and emotionally involving.  Lisa Genova, the author, is an alzheimer's researcher and constructed the story based on her extensive first-hand knowledge of the disease.<br /><br />As the book moves through the progression of Alice's disease, the reader feels the terror and loss of self that alzheimer's inflicts. Another reviewer commented that we could see the &#34;bones&#34; of the research sticking out in places, but, for me, this added credibility to the story.  I laughed and I cried and was humbled by Alice's grace and heroism and that of her children.<br /><br />This powerful book will stay with you for a long time after reading it.

B00AQMQBKK|5.0|Elder Sign Omens is based on the cooperative roleplaying board game by Fantasy Flight Games of the same name (itself adapted from the more-complex Arkham Horror board game), and features the same art and gameplay from the board game, although some of the rules have been simplified. See the product description for a list of the differences between the app and the original board game.<br /><br />The art is worth the purchase price alone, and there is a fair amount of strategy, but most of the game comes down to luck as the gameplay involves using icons taken from the dice of the board game in order to match symbols and \\"solve\\" challenges. You have no control over which icons you get, although certain investigators have special abilities that can change the icons in some situations, and there are items (like clues and spells) that let you manipulate the icons. If you don't get the right icons to solve all the challenges in an area, you lose them one by one, and once you run out you take damage and likely cause some other bad thing to happen.<br /><br />Your goal is to lead a team of up to four investigators and collect a certain number of elder signs (magical symbols of protection) in order to keep a specific Great Old One (or Outer God in the case of Azathoth) from destroying the world. The base game comes with three campaigns (Yig, Tsathoggua, and Azathoth). You can buy 2 additional campaigns for $2.99 each that include new Great Old Ones, new gameplay mechanics, and new investigators. The Cthulhu campaign departs from the museum and has you exploring islands in the south Pacific in order to uncover R'lyeh and keep Cthulhu from awakening, while the Ithaqua campaign has you facing both the influence of the Great Old One, and the power of the weather as you trek across a frozen wasteland with finite supplies.<br /><br />Be warned that this is a hard game. There are several tutorial videos that show you the mechanics of the game, but even when you master the mechanics, gather a competent team of investigators, and use your items wisely, you're still going to die horribly more often than anything else. This will mostly be due to the high element of luck that's involved in the game due to its dice-based resolution mechanic. If you don't have the icons you need to resolve the challenge, you lose. It can be incredibly frustrating when you're doing everything you can, and the game is simply denying you the icons you need and causing you to fail over and over again. However, if you're patient, you'll eventually win.<br /><br />If you're a fan of the Cthulhu Mythos, H.P. Lovecraft, the Arkham Horror or Elder Sign games, or cooperative roleplaying board games in general, I would highly recommend this game. It's very difficult to find a group of people to play a complicated game like Arkham Horror or Elder Sign, not to mention that those board games (especially if you buy the expansions) are really expensive. This game allows you to challenge the Mythos solo whenever and wherever you want. I wish there were more campaigns, especially a \\"King in Yellow\\" or Nyarlathotep campaign, but those could be added later as expansions.<br /><br />The difficulty may turn some people off, so here are some tips for new players...<br />- Don't be afraid to use your starting items early. You get more items when you complete tasks<br />- Consider using 1 or 2 prime investigators to do the actual heavy lifting and using your other investigator slots for support characters (who can heal your prime(s)). This allows you to concentrate your items with 1 or 2 investigators, meaning that those investigators have access to more resources to tackle individual tasks.<br />- Remember your investigator's special abilities, and use the right investigator for the right task.<br /><br />Lastly, play the Yig campaign until you get the hang of the mechanics, and get better at planning and investigator management. Don't get frustrated when you lose (which you will ... a lot),and enjoy the wonderful artwork as you battle for your soul and sanity.and enjoy the wonderful artwork as you battle for your soul and sanity.

B0025KVLS8|5.0|\\"Now, with this album in your library, you have a collection of Beatles recordings which is comprehensive and up-to-date. At the same time it is interesting to remember that this is the first-ever album release to be made up entirely of self-composed and self-performed Beatle compositions.\\" ~ Tony Barrow ~<br /><br />This album is the original soundtrack of the enjoyable film \\"A Hard Day's Night.\\"<br /><br />Stroll down memory lane as you listen to The Beatles singing thirteen of their hit songs starting off with the title track \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" down to a fitting closer \\"I'll Be Back.\\" All the songs are from the creative pens of two of the most remarkable and prolific songwriting team of John Lennon and Paul McCartney.<br /><br />My all-time favorites and highlights from this album include \\"If I Fell\\" where John Lennon and Paul McCartney share an equal billing with the lead vocals. Paul shines alone as he sings \\"And I Love Her\\" in a beautiful setting without the vocal support of his group.<br /><br />\\"Anytime At All\\" is my topmost choice that showcases the matchless songwriting skills of Lennon and McCartney. This is the song that defines their writing style as brilliant, pronounced and well-crafted.<br /><br />\\"If you're feeling sorry and sad<br />I really sympathize<br />If the sun has faded away<br />I'll try to make it shine<br />There is nothing I won't do<br />When you need a shoulder to cry on<br />I hope it will be mine\\"<br /><br />This is one of the Beatles very best classic recordings of all-time.

Their music is wild, pungent, hard-hitting, uninhibited...and personal. The do-it-yourself angle ensures complete originality at all stages of the process.\\" ~ Tony Barrow ~<br /><br />At one point in my life, I admired George Harrison, Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr and John Lennon collectively known as The Beatles or The Fab Four. I consider them as the most fabulous, the most interesting and the very best Pop group the music world has ever known.<br /><br />This album, \\"Please Please Me,\\" will take you back in time when The Beatles were dominating not only the airwaves, but the Billboard charts with their bestselling records. All the songs they created and recorded became instant hits and bestsellers that eventually gained them worldwide recognition and have built a fan base that consisted of millions in numbers mostly women, both young and old alike who swooned over them and their songs. I myself loved the group but I had a huge crush on George Harrison. I thought he was the \\"cutest\\" among the group and I liked the way he sang and played his guitar.<br /><br />You'll be delighted with fourteen of their greatest hits such as \\"Please Please Me,\\" \\"Love Me Do,\\" \\"Baby It's You\\" and my all-time favorite McCartney/Lennon composition, \\"P.S.

Still, the game, overall, is easy to learn but difficult to master, and gets harder as you progress.<br /><br />You can play the same levels over again with totally different results, just as long as the end goal of &quot;human extinction&quot; is achieved.  My son and I have both progressed far in the game, but have different techniques to achieve our goals, and use different genetic modifiers for our strategy.<br /><br />I recommend this game highly, and this is what game apps should be about: creative, puzzling, and even educational.  In a world inundated by Angry Birds and Fruit Ninja's, I will continue to enjoy games of this type, and hopefully the company that made this game will upgrade it for more fun and enjoyment.<br /><br />Did I mention how addicting Plague is?  Wow, I'm not one to get hooked on an app for any length of time, but this one did it.<br /><br />It's worth .99&cent;, and it's also worth it to buy an upgrade or two to expand your gaming experience.<br /><br />Watch out, it's the Plague!  Are you ready for it?
B005LAII12|5.0|The movie was so cute and humorous but beware of Ted's language and behavior as he matures throughout<br />the movie.
B008476HBM|4.0|Starts off very slow, but comes into its own near the last 100 pages. Great read. I'll definitely be looking into more Jane Austen books.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|With the kindle app you can take as many books as you want on vacation!  So far I ran on a Blackberry, Droid X and now a Droid Razor.  Flawless installation, updating and easy to use.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|I really like the main character Jack Reacher. This is a convoluted story but Jack finally figures it out after a lot of blood is spilled.  Read it and I'm sure you will want to continue to read Lee Child.
0345803485|5.0|Awesome ! Quick to get to my home !!! Perfect condition !! I highly recommend this seller buy all books from the,
B0058A119G|5.0|Streisand has a beautiful voice and I'm always amazed at her singing talents. This album contains some of the songs not as often sung and she sings them all wonderfully. I especially like the a Capella beginning of Windmills of Your Mind sung in perfect pitch as only she can do. The songwriters are also very talented. Loved the album !
B004R13U6Y|5.0|...adds more features to pdf on the Kindle.  Allows highlighting and notes, among others (haven't really tried them all yet).  Gives an alternative choice in opening and using pdf's on the kindle fire.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Wow! An excellent investment of 99 cents. I read this book on a whim and am I ever glad that I did. I have seen some reviewers who have complained about some of the language in this narrative, along with others who complained about excessive technical details,blah, blah, blah. All I can say is that this story just wouldn't have been near as much fun without both.<br /><br />I don't want to have any spoilers in this review, so I will simply say that I was drawn in from the very first sentence (and OMG it had profanity in it, which I'm pretty sure I would have used in a similar circumstance). The protagonist in this little epic was absolutely awesome in his never give up attitude no matter what went wrong in his efforts to survive until rescue could be undertaken and his irreverent take on things both good and bad just made this book that much harder to put down (ya gotta love a guy who can find humor when things go so wrong as to seem totally insurmountable).<br /><br />Kudos to author, Andy Weir. This book should be selling for far more than 99 cents. Some reviewers have said that this book would make a great movie and I wholeheartedly agree, I just wish I had connection to get in on producing it!<br /><br />I said I wanted to avoid spoilers but dang it I just can't help it...look boobs (.Y.)  Buy the book, you'll understand, haha!
B008YU0AOE|5.0|This calculator works great (installed on Kindle Fire and Kindle Fire HD).  Changes from basic to more complicated when screen is rotated from portrait to landscape.  Small ad never seems to get in the way.
B000FVNX2Q|4.0|As a finance student, I have to get a finance calculator, and my professor told me this one is good. It helped me a lot during the last semester.
B005CRQ4GU|2.0|It wasn't fun to read.  I could even feel my 8yr old son's anticipation dissipate as I read on, hoping that the next chapter (day) would be a funny one.  My 13yr old wasn't interested enough to finish it.  If the previous books were a Diary, then this one was merely a chronicled journal of a boy that couldn't get a date no matter what he tried...and it was as boring as that just sounded.  The author just really lost touch with what made the other books worth while...the ability to relate to kids of almost any age.  Gone is the sibling rivalry  and interactions of the older and younger brothers that made it interesting for the different age groups.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|The author does a good job of making what should be a dull book interesting.  It is well written, but could use some editing.  I felt the book when off on some unnecessary tangents toward the end.  The story deals with an older couple dealing with their relationship in old age, their hidden secrets and creating a new life going forward.  Their epiphany is triggered by the impending death of a long lost friend
B00AYB0SX4|3.0|It was good but not great. I like Jennifer Lawrence and think she is one of the most up and comming female stars today. I thought she was great in the hunter games and look forward to the next sequail.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Missed this one on live tv so I got it from Amazon.  Great to be able to catch up without waiting a whole week!
B009CPJHY4|4.0|this movie was better than I expected so I gave it for stars. I thank you need to be an older person to enjoy this film. I do not think younger people would like this movie. I just thought it was entertaining and enjoyed watching this film.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|DeMille does his research almost too well. This book is pretty scary in the context of current events. But, it's totally captivating in it's unique characters and John Corey's monologues and dialogues.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|All I can say is WOW!...Great book! It's one of those books that you can't really talk about without giving anything away...If you like Science Fiction that takes place in an apocalyptic or dystopian future (or even if you don't), then just go read it!!!
B008469DGY|5.0|Hands down the most fun I've had with any video game. Self challenging and a truly fun way to pass a few minutes or an hour!!
B004KRWQLU|5.0|The first of the king of shock-rock following his Greatest Hits, the songs here have a way of dancing in your head after hearing them. The songs, as always have a rather graven image. &#34;Only Women Bleed&#34;, &#34;Escape&#34; and &#34;The Black Widow&#34; ( with a guest appearance from Vincent Price! ), are the most popular. The others too ( &#34;Steven&#34; and &#34;Here Again&#34; are 2 songs combined about a man who cant escape his youth ) are also great. Once you hear it it is indeed yet another masterpiece you can play time and time again.
B008B68J2G|5.0|Super-cute play set! I bought it for my 9 year old niece for Christmas, she loved it, I loved it. The design (as with most Monster High items) is really fun and creative, and this set seemed to have a lot of extra fun little details and pieces. She'll probably lose those little pieces, but even so, the furniture on its own is charming and a great setting for her dolls to meet and hang out in.
B000I9U9A4|4.0|great movie watched it 3 times catch more evey time  m m m m m m m m  m m
B004ZNA7WY|5.0|Already had my own copy and bought this one as a Christmas present.  All Pink Floyd CDs are great.  It arrived within 3 days of ordering without any special shipping cost.
0930289234|5.0|Sublime Cultural Commentary blended with artful storytelling. A defining light of the potential of the graphic art medium. Deserves to be read and re-read every few years as a measurement of hust how demented society is.
B0015DROBO|3.0|I arrived late to the party with this saga of books.  The first 70 pages were a slow go even with Salander to bring me along.  Here I thought Zaydee from the book That Girl Started Her Own Country was my only love, but now I have a serious love affair on my hands.  Will I purse further or will I remain faithful...my heart remains with my first....both equally exciting but my arousal seems unquenched....I foresee more to come, but must remain true, ugghhhh!  What do I do :)!
1609611543|3.0|This book interested me because of digestive issues I've had all my life, so I'm going to give up just wheat and see what happens.  I agree the book is a rehash of the Atkins diet that I tried 30 years ago.  10 years ago I lost 97#s on the Weight Watchers program, and lost nearly every ounce of fat including that at my waistline.  I went from a tight 44\\" pant to a comfortable 34\\".  Over the years I've gained back 15#s or so, but it's because I'm less active and not as careful with with the number of points I'm consuming.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|one of the best movies of the year it had action, drama, and even some comedy so sit back relax and get sucked into looper ladies and gentlemen
B0053O89YM|5.0|The item was just as it was advertized...new and wrapped in its original cellophane.  It arrived earlier than promised, to my pleasant surprise.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This is a great game. I really love it. The graphics are great. Love the storyline.<br />This is a must buy.
B0077ATSSQ|3.0|There is an old adage that tells us that a recipe can only be as good as the ingredients that are used.  If that is true, consider the Oscar-nominated Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close. It begins with director Stephen Daldry, a man so narratively gifted that all three of his previous films have gone on to earn \\"Best Picture\\" nominations.  To that, you add the two-time, Academy Award-winning actor, Tom Hanks, in the role of a saintly father who may be the only person on earth who understands his uniquely challenged son.  Now mix in Sandra Bullock, just two years removed from her own Oscar-winning performance, as a bereaved mother left to deal with her own grief, even as she struggles to help her son come to grips with his loss.  Finally, take all these ingredients and set them in the context of the \\"jumpers\\" leaping from the burning towers on September 11th.  What should emerge from the oven is a scintillating film that finally gives voice to our collective grief and rage.  But, unfortunately, this is not the case.  Indeed, there are two critical weaknesses that take the legs right out from underneath this film and ultimately prevent it from becoming anything more than an overly-saccharine sympathy card that leaves nothing but a bad aftertaste in your mouth.<br /><br />So what are the issues?  Well, the first problem has to do with the adaptation of the source material itself.  In fairness to Eric Roth, anytime a screenwriter has to distill the content of a novel down to a script that can be filmed in two hours, material is going to be sacrificed.  But in this case, many of Jonathan Safran Foer's most insightful musings on the nature of war and terror have been left on the editing room floor.  In the novel, the only reason the grandfather re-emerges into the life of this scarred young boy is because he, too, knows what it means to lose a parent to the ever-turning gears of war.  But here, in the film, the fire-bombings of Dresden during World War II are used only as a set up to explain the grandfather's selectively mute nature.  Thus, the larger theme of war and its impact on the lives of the innocent is almost completely absent.  And that is a very real problem when you are attempting to say something of value on the subject of 9/11. If you do ultimately decide to see this film, ask yourself this: how would the film have been substantially changed if Oskar's father did not die in the attacks of 9/11, but in a random car accident that left him with just enough time to place a few phone calls?  If you believe, as I do, that nothing would have functionally changed, than you will begin to see the central problem with the film.  To reduce the events of September 11th to nothing more than a plot device that allows a character to grow is to fundamentally disrespect the nearly 3000 people that lost their lives on that day in history.<br /><br />The second major issue with this film has to do with the casting of young Thomas Horn.  For some inexplicable reason, director Stephen Daldry made the decision to cast a complete unknown in the role of Oskar Schell.  Prior to this film, Horn had never acted either in film or in television; and that is a massive liability for a film in which the young actor is required to play an emotionally shattered boy who is likely suffering from the effects of Asperger's Syndrome as well as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.  Yes, every once in a while, a Haley Joel Osment in The Sixth Sense comes along to take us all by surprise.  But that is the exception and not the rule.<br /><br />So where does Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close sit in the pantheon of 9/11 films?  Probably somewhere beneath Oliver Stone's World Trade Center, and just above Adam Sandler's Reign Over Me.  At best, it's an adequate film that leaves the viewer wondering: is it just too soon to expect a film to really be able to handle the events of that day?<br /><br />Further reviews can be found at bloodstainedink.wordpress.com.s a set up to explain the grandfather's selectively mute nature.

B008JFUUQ2|5.0|Love Pitch Perfect!  I was a band geek, not a choir geek, but you still have to love the nerdy music experience in college.  And the outrageous oneliners were fantastic!  The extras on the Blue-Ray give you probably another half hour of enjoyment.  Just too funny!
B005LAIGPA|4.0|Sometimes, for reasons we cannot fully explain, a film succeeds in ways that neither we, nor the studio, honestly expect.  If you want a great example of just this sort of phenomena, look no further that the recently released and poorly named, Chronicle.  Shot on an almost ridiculously low budget by a director whose only previous experience was on cable television, it was released in the dead of winter - a time slot usually reserved for films that will soon be making their debut appearance in the remainder bins of your local Walmart.<br /><br />But Chronicle smartly rises above its humble budget and its inauspicious release date by offering something unusual: a nuanced psychological profile of a teenager struggling to rise above the ruins of his home life.  Mashing up the \\"found footage\\" and super-hero genres, it wisely avoids the rote stereotypes often found in films of this nature, and instead gives us a briskly paced meditation upon humiliation, empowerment, hubris, and naked aggression.<br /><br />By the time this pleasant little treat reaches its unexpected climax, the viewer is left wondering whether this might just be one of the more honest portraits of teenaged American life in the 21st century.  While the films are miles apart in tonality, one couldn't help but think back to Diablo Cody's Juno, an equally insightful look into the mind of modern adolescence.<br /><br />If you are a fan of the unusual and/or unexpected, I would strongly recommend seeing this film, in spite of its terrible title and its less-than-inspired marketing campaign.  This is the kind of film that heralds the arrival of a new talent, and I for one will be eagerly waiting in line when the creators of this film release their next work.<br /><br />Further reviews found at: bloodstainedink.wordpress.com
B0090X4GLW|2.0|I bought things out of order, the soundtrack before the movie.  The soundtrack is insanely short, especially for a music based movie.  Having now seen Pitch Perfect, I'm incredibly disappointed by the music that was left off the soudtrack, and you can tell many tracks were specifically re-recorded.<br /><br />The movie was great, the soundtrack is just a rip-off.
