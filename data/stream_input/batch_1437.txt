B007SGM084|5.0|Saw the 1st book reviewed on the today show and decided to download trilogy. I have finished 1st book and I agree with Kathy lee and Hoda saying it is \\"hot\\" is an understatement. Very intense but great story can't wait until I start second book.
0385736002|5.0|This book was AWESOME!  The Alchemyst is a book about two teenage twins who have parents traveling the world, so they are staying with their Aunt Agnes (not really their aunt). The boy twin(Josh) has a job at a book store. His boss is a man named Nick Fleming and his wife Perry. His sister(Josh's sister Sophie) works at a coffee shop across the street. Then one day Sophie see's something strange out the window in front of the book store... read more to learn more<br /> I love books where the main characters have no idea what's going on until like the second book which I have read (I've read the first five waiting for #6) READ THE ALCHEMYST NOW!!!!!!! (Written by my 11 year old son)
B004SEUJX2|5.0|I'll save an aesthetic analysis and historical discussion for another forum on this film. I would like to focus on this Blu-Ray edition which has been unfairly maligned by those unfamiliar with historical trends in cinematography, the basics of cinematography and DP Conrad Hall's strategies in this film. I almost did not get this blu-ray of one of my favorite films because of the negative remarks regarding the HD mastering.<br />I'm glad I ran across Robert Harris' discussion of this HD transfer, did anybody claim restoration? I think it looks and sounds great.
0345803485|1.0|If you must, borrow this book from a friend, don't waste your money. I was encouraged to read this book by several friends and I'm incredibly disappointed.  I enjoyed the Twilight saga, despite Meyer's sub-par literary skills, and can see the comparisons. However, this book is atrocious.  Ana makes me yawn, Christian is not the least bit intriguing, and the sex scenes are sophomoric attempts at BDSM.  And what is with the \\"inner goddess\\" talk throughout?? Lame.  I can usually read a book of this length in a few nights and this one took over two weeks.  I ended up approaching it as research, trying to figure out the hype while ignoring the repetitive vocabulary. The only conclusion I could come to is that the women who find this titillating and shocking just finished reading Judy Blume's \\"Forever\\" for the first time.
0345803485|5.0|My friend recommended this book to me and it sounded interesting.  Once I started reading, I couldn't put it down! I read it in two days! I can't wait to read the second one!

0143038583|3.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading omnivore's dilemma.<br />As an American who has attempted to eat conscientiously for the past 2 decades I naturally find the realities of our food system to be quite fascinating.<br />I won't go into all the details, as many other reviewers have that base covered, but I will remark that much of what Mr Pullman reveals isn't exactly surprising (if you pay any attention whatsoever to \\"food news\\" in the mainstream) but he puts the facts together in a way that is engaging and compelling.<br /><br />My major source of dissatisfaction is that Mr Pollan summarily dismissed vegetarianism as unworkable.  This is in stark contrast with the exhaustive (yet interesting) research that he put into all the other eating paradigms that he covered.<br />Based seemingly solely on his experiences at Polyface farms (where meat eating is the family's \\"bread and butter\\" in that they support themselves largely by selling meat)  the author essentially declares that eating animals is vital to the entire scheme of sustainable farming.  But that is an odd statement when it is only obvious in the context of the particular model used by Polyface.<br /><br />Speaking of Polyface, it was also a bit annoying and distracting that Mr Pollan seemed so enamored by Polyface farms.  It was a bit reminiscent of a new religious convert.  And it was annoying that he regarded his female friend's reaction to the farm family's Christianity as such a surprise or as being uncool.  Hello?  The book is about food, not religion, and not his female friend.  But if Mr Pollan wants to bring religion into it...  Don't be surprised when your non religious or atheist friends don't exhibit excitement upon entering a home with religious decorations and plaques up on the walls and where they will be expected to participate in saying grace at mealtimes.<br />Let them know ahead of time and let them choose if they want to go through that.  After all, how many Christians would be delighted to sit around saying grace to Ganesha without their consent?<br /><br />But really the summary dismissal of vegetarianism with no reasonable supportive evidence or even a thorough argument was a major disappointment to me because I have been predominantly vegetarian most of my life.<br />What exactly about vegetarianism makes it so unworkable?<br />Such a frustrating oversight in an otherwise decent and important work.

B004EPZ0BG|5.0|Yes, this is a rom-com but not your typical one. It has quick-witted snappy dialogue you can imagine you and your friends would actually say and not just a series of \\"oh, aren't we clever\\" one-liners. In other words, it takes place in an adult world where people have actual lives (and jobs!) and have actual conversations between all the sex.<br /><br />The chemistry between Mila Kunis and Justin Timberlake is perfect. The story also makes sense especially when you get the full picture of their family backgrounds. The supporting cast could have been gratuitous but isn't and Woody Harrelson steals the show as a foulmouthed gay sports editor at GQ. Richard \\"No Pants\\" Jenkins takes another turn as one of the most underrated actors around as Timberman's Alzheimery dad. Dharma Elfman plays Justin's sis. Kunis's mom is played by the always terrific Patricia Clarkson who nails the hippy dippy mom role to a tie-dye T. Gratuitous Emma Stone is classic in her lone scene. Gratuitous Andy Samberg as well in this.<br /><br />The extras are nothing to write home about but the movie stands well enough on its own to be worthy of viewing. Plus I have two words that send this movie over the top: flash mob. Watch and you'll see what I mean.
B000002MU3|5.0|This sludgy concept album is great and the lack of deviation from the general mood the album tries to portray only helps it. I am speechless this was their 9th album, because at that point creativity is lost in most bands, but R.E.M. proves why they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame here, they're the outlier.  One suggestion, if you're a fan of the \\"concept album\\" check out FAKEBOOK by Yo La Tengo, another great example of the \\"genre\\".

B006OB3K56|5.0|Shame is a difficult movie to rate or review because of the nature of the film. Many people may shy away from this great film due to the NC-17 rating and all the nudity. This movie is about a man (Michael Fassbender) who lives in NYC who appears to have a normal life to most, however he is a sex addict. He is the protagonist of our story, however throughout the film we are not sure if we really like this guy or not. He sees multiple women and retires to the bathroom at work daily to \\"relive some pressure\\". He has a very neat, scheduled, clean, organized life and has managed to control his urges the best he can.<br /><br />His life gets turned upside-down when his sister (Carey Mulligan) drops in on him and asks to live with him for a while. She causes a hiccup in his daily routine and his neat clean little world.<br /><br />The acting is brilliant. Fassbender is remarkable and gives a true deep performance. Mulligan also was outstanding, and in my opinion both actors are at the top of their game in this film. The interactions, dialogue and situations they are introduced to, are perfectly documented by the brilliant directing and classic, yet clean modern cinematography. Most of the scenes run very long with no cuts. It is a very raw film and wonderfully portrayed to the audience.<br /><br />The PQ & AQ are pristine and could not get any better. I blind bought this film after hearing so many good things about it. It is dark, it is sexual, however it is about the emptiness of a man who may seem he has it together, yet is very lost. I highly recommend this film to fans of underground, indie, or non-mainstream movies. It is not a movie I will watch very often, however the characters and the depth of the acting will bring me back for multiple viewings in the future.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|Very imaginative settings for playing. Nothing is really in a straight line so you really have to use imagination to get around and to your targets.
B0072PUC7W|4.0|I have to be honest, this compilation is very good.  I am a little unimpressed with CD 1.  CD 2 is great.  The tracks aren't as smooth and creamy as last year's 2011 ASOT.  Last year's was just on a different level than this year.  Overall I would buy again, but I'm not sure that it will turn into a classic.

0671027344|5.0|It's one of my favorite books. It's like every page has a one-liner that you can take out and write down somewhere to remind yourself that life is to be lived and enjoyed. My copy is highlighted and underlined and annotated because there are so many quotes that plucked on my heartstrings. The themes of drugs and sexuality are not for the naive reader, but if I had teenagers I think that it would be something I would read with them. Chbosky shows us the ugly of being a teenager and the dark of being a teenager with depression. I consider it to be The Catcher in the Rye for my generation. Charlie feels like a real person as you read--like he could be your neighbor or that quiet kid at the back of your high school history class. To me, he probably feels so real because I was Charlie and I am Charlie and everything he says seems to have passed through my mind at one point in time. Such a beautiful, poetic work. I'll be holding on to this one for a long, long time.

0061726834|5.0|I was expecting another lame future-dystopia romance. We're all going through Hunger Games withdrawals (even though, honestly, I'm not a huge fan of the books) and the dystopia thing seems to be replacing the paranormal romance trend.<br />The first thing that excited me was the fact that our main character was not a rebel. She was just a girl trying to be normal and fit in. She doesn't want to be a rebel, and is afraid of falling in love just as she has been taught. There's nothing particularly extraordinary about her, it's her friend that's the beautiful and strong-willed one.<br />Second, I liked the slower pace. I know most people didn't. I prefer to get to know the character and see their daily life before we get to the drama. Also, this leaves room for something that I think most people are forgetting about: character development.<br />Finally, the ending. Oh, the ending. I don't wan to give anything away. I thought it was fantastic. The final lines, where she remembers what her mother told her. It was exhilarating and wonderful. I put it down grinning and giggling and feeling romantic.<br />It's the kind of book that makes you want to fall in love.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|it helps time go by. I like the graphics. easy to play. helps me relax and unwind after a long day
006197806X|5.0|I'm going to be honest: I was really nervous about this one. I thought that the first had ended so flawlessly, that final paragraph where she's running and remembering what her mother said... Oh, my heart took flight. I have to say that I can't decide now which book I like better! I was shocked and delighted with the second installment.<br />I felt that she didn't really mourn (spoiler alert if you haven't read Delirium) her lost love. I would have liked to have heard some of those beautiful descriptions that Lauren Oliver does on teenage heartbreak and woe.<br />I loved seeing the daily life. It's like everyone wants a get-in-get-out-constant-action-novel. I want someplace where I can go and escape, somewhere I can picture people living day-to-day. She really shows us the Wilds and its way of life.<br />I loved the second half of the book. Life goes on! Thank you! He may be gone but that doesn't mean your young life is over! There are others!<br />And the ending. I won't give anything away but I saw that cliche coming and I just didn't care. It was odd, I usually roll my eyes at books like these but I think that the way the world is opened up and given to us in such a beautiful way just... makes it.<br />This is my kind of book.

B001R4MEUM|4.0|Recently got reacquainted with this gem in anticipation of seeing The Musical Box' recreation of The Lamb. Trying to explain the psychedelic and rambling story to friends, I went back to the original liner notes and got the gist of the episodic tale of Rael's death and rebirth, or at least this is my take on it;<br /><br />The story is about a young Puerto Rican graffiti punk in Manhattan named Rael, (Gab-rael, REAL as opposed to unreal?) who is sucked into an alternate dimension and goes through rebirth.<br /><br />One early morning  a lamb mysteriously appears in the middle of Time Square. As it lays down a dark cloud descends, covering everything in a woolly dust cloud.<br />Rael emerges from the subway, having spent the night tagging. The dust cloud appears before him like a wall, reflecting images of Broadway's glorious past as junkies and prostitutes are swallowed by it. The dust catches up with Rael like a windshield hitting a fly and covers him like a crust. He loses consciousness.<br /><br />He wakes up in a cocoon, feeling safe, but outside it is a cage made of stalactites and stalagmites. His brother John appears outside the cage, and walks away silently. The cage dissolves and Rael begins to spin. He wakes up in the factory of Lifeless Packaging, where humans are mass produced, numbered and packaged.<br />Rael sees members of his old gang on the production line, along with his brother John. Rael runs away, up the stairs to a staged version of New York. He starts to remember his past as a juvenile delinquent and his awkward early adventures with girls involving a book on erogenous zones.<br /><br />He cuddles a \\"prickly porcupine\\", a metaphor for his heart, as the next instrumental piece is called hairless heart and the notes says he shaves the porcupine. Or he spanks his monkey, which makes sense if you go with my interpretation of the carpet crawlers.<br /><br />Going down a red corridor with lambswool floor he encounters the Carpet Crawlers, a group of slow moving people (clinging like fleas to the golden fleece) wandering aimlessly around a big room, unable to ascend a spiral staircase leading to the Chamber. They mutter \\"We've got to get in to get out\\" These are representatives of sperm looking to reach the egg in order to be born.<br />Rael climbs the staircase and reaches the Chamber of 32 Doors. Only one leads out, but which?<br />There are advisors, politicians, rich men, farmers, his parents even giving advice on which to choose, but each try brings him back.<br /><br />A pale blind woman named Lilith (the first wife of Adam) takes Rael by the hand and leads him through the right door, through tunnels to a vestibule with a stone throne. She leaves him there and a bright light fills the cave. The walls come crumbling down and buries him. Over the rubble, an personification of death appears, the \\"Supernatural Anaesthetist.\\"<br />in the guise of an embalmer. He does a dance and leaves as Rael crawls out from under the rocks.<br /><br />He follows the scent of perfume down a passage until he reaches a pink watered pool of water shrouded in mist. The perfume grows stronger as three snakelike creatures are swimming towards Rael.<br />Each reptilian creature has the diminutive head and breasts of a beautiful woman. They are the Lamia. (in Greek and Roman mythology they were female demons that preyed on children)His horror gives way to infatuation as their soft green eyes show their welcome. Rael enters the pool and gives in to their caresses, which turn to bites. As the Lamia ingest his blood they start convulsing in pain and die. Rael then proceeds to eat their flesh.<br /><br />Leaving by the same door from which he had come in, Rael  comes upon the freakish Colony if Slippermen, groteque figures covered in ugly lumps and slimy stumps . One of the colony approaches him.<br />Rael is a little disillusioned, when the Slipperman reveals that the entire colony have one-by-one been through the same glorious romantictragedy with the same three Lamia, who regenerate themselves every time, and that now Rael shares their physical appearance and shadowy fate. Amongst the contorted faces of the Slippermen, Rael recognises what is left of his brother John.<br /><br />John bitterly explains that the entire life of the Slipperman is devoted to satisfying the never-ending hunger of the senses, which has been inherited from the Lamia. There is only one escape route; a dreaded visit to the notorious Doktor Dyper who will remove the source of the problems, or to put it less politely, castrate. They decide to go together to visit the Doktor.<br /><br />After the procedure, they wear their severed members in yellow tubes hung around their necks. Suddenly a raven swoops down and carries off Rael's tube. Rael gives pursuit, but John refuses to join in the chase.<br />The raven flies down a tunnel and drops the precious package into a ravine, where a river carries it off. Up above, through a skylight comes the familiar smells and sounds of Manhattan.<br /><br />Forgetting his lost member, Rael rushes for the exit, but stops when he hears a cry for help. Below, in the raging rapids he sees his brother John. As the skylight closes Rael jumps into the river to save him.<br /><br />Pulling John out of the waters, he discovers it's not his brother, it's himself that he rescued. The two bodies dissolve to become part of everything.tragedy with the same three Lamia, who regenerate themselves every time, and that now Rael shares their physical appearance and shadowy fate.

0553814826|5.0|I just finished reading, and working through the exercises in, this book. I still have a long road ahead of me, but I have a solid foundation to build on in my healing.<br /><br /> About the review entitled : Blame mommy and daddy-- Guess what? Abusive and neglectful parents do have a huge impact on their children that lasts; it changes who the child is at a deep level, and, without help, taints everything in the child's life, right up through adulthood. Parent's ARE responsible for the abuse/neglect of their children, and the impact it has on their children's lives. These children were innocent. The adult child has the responsibility to have the courage to see the truth, do what it takes to heal, and make sure they don't reenact the same patterns with their own children, partners, and other loved ones.

B005FISC52|5.0|First, I would like to say that I live in the UK where episode 7 of season 9 has just shown. I couldn't wait to watch it on regular tv so I pre-ordered this before it was released. The DVDs arrived this morning...3 weeks before they were due to be arrive. So kudos to Amazon.com for that quick delivery.<br />Second, I HAVE to say that One Tree Hill is incredible. I first watched the show when it started. I was 11 and not being a teenager didn't connect and stopped watching. However when I turned 16 I started watching again and couldn't believe how much I loved it. Now I'm 18 and have collected the series and still love it.<br />Congrats to Mark Schwahn, the cast and the crew for creating a tv show that really connects with it's audience, teens and adults.<br />If you haven't seen this, I recommend that you buy season 1 and I have no doubt that you won't enjoy it. And then you can buy the rest of this truly incredible series :)

B000JMLKCG|4.0|This book is difficult to read at first as it is written in a dialect we are not used to, however once that is established the story moves right along and the characters become familiar.  I felt many of the characters were flat and not fleshed out enough.  Elizabeth lacked \\"backbone\\"  I wanted her to have a bit more of the spunk of her \\"friend\\". I really liked the mayor and wished that he could have just thought before he opened his mouth.  Mr Hardys descriptions of the English countryside put me right there with him.  A good read.
1400069289|5.0|I began reading this book for my book club and was totally enthralled with it.  If anyone cannot find something applicable regarding habits and regulation of the self in the book, then they are not trying, or do not understand the material.  The main discussion of habits and will power occur in Chapters 1-4.  The remainder of the book is basically examples from business and life that expound upon what was learned earlier.  Some believe these chapters do not teach much, but I found these real life examples further illustrations of what was learned earlier.<br /><br />A few of the examples provided by the author Duhigg I unwittingly had been doing in particular areas of my life, and upon reflection, I now understand better why they worked (or in some cases did not work).  Duhigg wrote for the NY Times and its not surprising the writing is exemplary and well researched.  If you are a person who looks to improve yourself, this is a great book to read and add to your library.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I bought the first Wool on my Kindle and fell hard for both the writing and characters. But what impressed me the most was the ending. (Don't worry, no spoilers). Too often I read books that have an interesting premise and start strong, but have disappointing endings. Mostly I think those writers are the ones who start writing with no clear vision of where or how the story will end, and it shows.<br />But each of the Wool installments has an ending that was obviously crafted with care. Each one leaves me fulfilled, but also hungry for more. The endings aren't always happy, but they are nearly perfect. Thank you, Hugh Howey, for making stories that hook me from the first sentence and stay compelling through the last word.

B0025KVLUQ|5.0|I can't tell you how many copies of Abbey Road I have owned since 1970. From vinyl to vinyl master recordings and CD's. The sound is amazingly rich and clear from the opening notes of Come Together to The End. Stylishly packaged with several of the iconic Abbey Road photos as well as several photo sessions the Beatles did in 1969. Good narrative as to what was going on during the recording sessions. Overall a must for everyone's collection.

B0062OCNAI|5.0|Afterwards<br />By<br />Rosamund Lupton<br /><br />Speedy Summary...<br /><br />A fire at a school leaves devastation in its aftermath...cause of the fire?  It is believed to be arson.<br /><br />My Thoughts After Reading...<br /><br />This book begins so sweetly and then suddenly there is smoke, a fire, and devastation.  Jenny and her mum and one other student are the seriously injured.  It was a bit confusing in the beginning...I have to say...because although Jenny and her mum were injured...they were having sort of out of body experiences watching what was happening to them.  I didn't like this approach until I became used to it and I knew what was happening  but it runs through most of the novel...Jenny and Gracie follow all the key players throughout the hospital.  They try to remember what happened and who might have caused the fire.<br /><br />The suspense builds and builds in Afterwards...the half truths and lies and secrets permeate the story.  Sarah...sister in law to Gracie is a police detective and slowly begins digging to find out what really happened...it is so engrossing and so maddening and so intriguing that I could not stop reading.  The twists and turns and surprises...just kept me reading far into the night...I had about a hundred pages left...probably the best part of the book.<br /><br />This book touched me in many ways...it was beautifully written...precisely done...heartwarming and tragic and uplifting and sad.<br /><br />It is not a book I will soon forget.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this Bible. its the best thing to have other than the physical Bible. I suggest everyone download this app.
B0016MOWP0|2.0|Not impressed with the picture quality at all. Unfocused, grainy, just not what I expected. I have a lot of old movies on blu-ray so I know what a good one should look like. Better than DVD quality but not by much. Disappointing.
B007PTJOV0|3.0|it was ok but really hard to get far in the game. only because it always made you get a &quot;game over&quot; and I think it should make you do levels over and over until you get it. but that's my opinion.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is surprisingly a lot more entertaining than I thought it would be. Very addicting I keep wanting to play it all the time, even thought it does kinda suck when you run out of coins and or acorns.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This is a great book! very well written! Lots of imagination went into many of the characters in this book. Chapters always end where you must keep reading to see what is going to happen next! Cant wait to read the next one!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|good time consumer can be a little monotonous but still fun none the less. not much to do aside from collscting money and acorns but fun! ;)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is so fun and I play it all the time. it is good for 7 and up and you will want to play it all day cause it's addictive
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|awesome game :) its like pioneer trail on zynga... you have missions to complete for exp, and an energy limit that refreshes with time.

B002QE3CTY|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, but it wasn't very well written. It seemed as if it was written by  middle schooler (though that was't the case). I read this book after reading the Hunger Games (and loving them!). I recommend this book to all Hunger Games fans.

B001EAWMGA|4.0|I'm not sure why this fine film didn't get a wide theatrical release; it could be that industry execs are still thinking that Jim Caviezal is typecast from his portrayal of Jesus in \\"The Passion Of The Christ\\".<br /><br />Typecast or not, Jim Caviezal is a first-rate actor.  \\"Outlander\\" is a well-written film, but it's the kind of sci-fi adventure story that no actor goes into thinking that he'll get an oscar nod for his knock-your-socks-off great interpretation of his character ... because the characters, as written, really aren't anyone you haven't encountered before in similar films.<br /><br />Paul Newman said, \\"Give an actor a good script, and he can move the earth.\\"  Caviezal is living proof of this; what puts this particular film over the top, so to speak, is that Caviezal take a reasonably good script and adds a tremendous amount of depth to it.  Without any great monologues to work with, he creates the heart and soul of this script through his interactions with the other characters in the story, as a man from the future, learning to inhabit the past.  He is that rare actor who can successfully portray a quality of indomitability, whilst all the while seeming quite human, with no pretensions towards perfection.  Caviezal is fierce without being boorish or arrogant; and he's a man of flesh and blood, seemingly quite three-dimensional, without relying upon a \\"tragic flaw\\" to convince his audience that he's just as human as they are.<br /><br />In this, as well as other films he's done, Jim Caviezal inhabits not just his character, but also has the dramatic ability to allow his character's culture to inhabit him.  Films like \\"The Stoning of Soraya M.\\" and \\"Frequency\\" show clearly Caviezal's commitment to not just create the person, but to also give the audience an excellent sense of that person's era and culture, particularly in the way both of these express themselves in that person's speech, demeanor, and perspective.<br /><br />Well, that gets tricky here, because Caviezal's character is from the future, and he must acclimate himself to a place in the distant past.  He becomes a hybrid of both worlds; there's just something in the way he behaves that portrays the influences of his own future culture, along with this new (to him anyway) environment of the past in which he should be a fish out of water, but instead he soon becomes a leader.<br /><br />I won't bore you with a re-hash of the plot; read the synopsis if you're curious about that.  What I will tell you is that this is a good screenplay rendered into a fine film by the dramatic gifts of its star.<br /><br />If you're either a sci-fi fan, or, just a Jim Caviezal fan, you'll like this.  What you'll also like is this:  As I'm writing this in April of 2012, principle photography is being shot on \\"The Tomb\\", in which Caviezal will star with Stallone and Schwarzeneggar; he'll play a prison warden.  If successful, hopefully the studio execs will be convinced that Caviezal can open films on his own; an actor with this kind of ability shouldn't be typecast or denied his just and due success.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|E-book came without a hitch.  Read the trilogy in a couple of days, just in time for the movie.  Good story plot.  Can't wait for the other movie episodes.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This was a great buy. SO GLAD to be done with Twilight!!! I have 2 daughters, we often will buy books of movies we have or want to see. If your kids are into series books this will keep them reading. Perfect for teens and great for kid/parent time. My kids have read so many books- sometimes several times over - and constantly talk about them, which is great for thought and imagination. This is the second series book/movie we have enjoyed together. Hope you like it, too.
B004SIP9MY|5.0|one of the best horror films ever made. i own it & watch it all the time. id recommend it to anyone. itll make you really \\"scream\\"
B001ILFUDM|3.0|FYI...This a cut copy and Disney for some absurd reason will not Restore the original version. I Have seen the original back in the early sixties when I was just a kid, They cut the whole scene out where he ditches school and they start singing the song...\\"If you don't go to school you'll grow up to be a mule like all the monkey's in the zoo.<br />Also They cut the whole scene out where Geppetto goes to look for Pinocchio and goes out to sea and gets swallowed by the whale. They just show you the scene where he's already inside the belly of the whale.<br /><br />They really just butchered the whole film. I've been told by other people that Disney did it to shorten the film because it was too long.<br />However, In the corporate World the mentally is to get you to buy this version and then later on down the road they'll come out with a statement like...Newly found footage and now for the first time ever the complete newly restored version of Pinocchio. It's quite possible that it's all about money again. How Sad.<br /><br />\\"You can fool some of the people some of the time, But you can't fool all of the people all of the time.\\"<br /><br />We who love The old Disney films will have to wait a long time for \\"Song of The South\\" Disney says it too Racial and the people here in America can't handle it, But they released it on Laser Disc back in the late seventies early eighties in Japan. They can handle it over in Japan but we here in America can not. Let's face it Japan's more advanced then we are or maybe they paid Disney a good chunk of Monies for it? Absurd. This another film I had seen when it first came out and was one of my favorite of Disney films, There really was some good Philosophy in it.<br />\\"Yesumm There's a whole lot to be learning about the behind feet of a mule.\\"<br /><br />Disney needs to wake up and see what their shoveling!!!<br />\\"IAM\\" Jaime Galati

B006IDG2T6|5.0|A great thought-provoking book about whether we really have free will. Brings up a lot of questions about our current justice system and the possibility of reform as we learn more about how the brain works. My only complaint is that the book is so short! Not truly having free will has so many implications in so many areas and the book has almost an infinite number of topics it could explore. Still a great read!
B00785P2QC|5.0|plays great on my kindle fire. totally awesome game. glad I got it. keep it up. awesome job. what's left to say.
B007MU85D0|5.0|Before listening to these guys some of my favorite bands were the Arcade Fire, Avett Brothers, Mumford & Sons, etc. and Of Monsters and Men is worthy of such company. An absolutely outstanding debut, can't wait to see what they have in store for us in the future. Huge fan!!!

B001KX50BK|5.0|My prime reason for this review is to recommend the Blu-ray edition of this movie. Pretty Woman is a great romantic film and it has made the transition to Blu-ray flawlessly. It is well worth the cost.

1594203334|3.0|I just finished reading this book, and took away some clever French parenting tips such as saying to my children: \\"It's me who decides,\\" or \\"You don't have the right\\" to hit your brother...and the idea of giving children \\"framed\\" autonomy. Those were the high points. And I wish that schools in America had the same focus on delicious menus, but alas, we don't!<br /><br />What disappointed me was how the author characterized American children as rude (not saying hello when greeting adults), whiny (kicking their parents in public), argumentative (rather than complying with adults' instructions) and being overly-reliant on their parents (not going to sleep-away camp at a young age). While those traits may characterize a particular cohort of American parents engulfed in modern parenting angst, I would argue that there are plenty of parents in America who raise polite, autonomous, respectful children with broad culinary palates who go away to camp at age 5. Perhaps they are not the stereotypical bratty American children one sees on TV, but I know lots who are just like the ones the author describes as uniquely French, my own children included.<br /><br />So, for that reason, and because the author is an experienced fact-based journalist, I'm disappointed that so much of the premise of the book is founded upon faulty data--using as comparison, Americans she's encountered and who she presumes to be representative of the American way of parenting. It seems too anecdotal--her evidence too spotty and suited toward her argument. (The book seems like it could have benefited from a healthy editing, with a dominant focus on what's good about French parenting, rather than so much comparison with America.) In some places she does insert the inevitable caveat (\\"while not all are like this...\\") but too often she attributes Frenchness to what most people would consider regular 'ole good parenting, regardless of nationality.
B004QZ9PLU|3.0|\\"The Best of Me\\" was a beautifully written story similar to other Nicholas Sparks' unrequited love stories. I am a huge Sparks fan, but was disapointed, yet not surprised, with the ending.
0345803485|4.0|The \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" trilogy is a classic romance and a sex primer.<br /><br />E L James follows one of romance's most beloved character arcs: hard-core bad boy redeemed by innocence and love. In this case, the hero (I don't think this is a spoiler anymore) likes to tie up his sexual partners, partly because he can't bear to be touched. (Anne Stuart had such a hero in \\"Ruthless.\\")<br /><br />What's different about this romance is that the writing is relatively straightforward, not lush but certainly repetitive. If you had a shot of booze every time the author uses the word \\"smirk,\\" you would be dead and toe-tagged within 15 minutes--30 at the outside. And the sex is rarely romantic--it's in-your-face uninhibited and panty-soaking hot.<br /><br />Beyond the unrelenting sex (she bites her bottom lip and he must have her!), I'm in awe of E L James's creating a hero who wields his \\"sexpertise\\" like a weapon, yet is in many ways still a virgin, and a beautiful 21-year-old heroine who is virtually untouched--until she falls for the hero.<br /><br />If you accept the premise, \\"Fifty Shades\\" is intense; it's all angst, anger and sex. James delivers what every romance promises: an emotional journey in which the hero and heroine triumph over seemingly impossible odds to find happiness.<br /><br />Add kinky and stir.
0307346617|5.0|I am very impressed with how detailed each individual story is written. This book really opened my mind to what could happen in the event of a total global meltdown. It's so very creative.
0345803485|1.0|I don't even know what to say!  I am so amazed at how bad this book was. I am even more amazed that it is so popular.  For all of those people who wrote reviews that said something to the effect \\"i read three chapters and I gave up\\" - don't worry, you missed nothing!!!  There was no plot to this story. I kept reading it to the end thinking \\"something has to happen other than all this sadomasochism nonsense.\\" But nope, that was all it was!  I have no intention of reading the sequels.
0307956350|2.0|I had high hopes for this book but it was pretty bad. None of the characters were sympathetic and the only thing that was clear was that everyone lied. The author jumped around so much that it was hard to know where you were in the story. I normally don't pan books but it was a waste of money at $12.99.
B0018QQQK8|4.0|This book was enjoyable. Nothing super heavy or intense.  Very light reading but it held my interest until the last page.  I liked it.

B007MDB71O|4.0|When a company known for creating franchising opportunities fails to create a toy line for a family-oriented action film, you know something's not right. Not being an insider, I don't know what was going on at Disney, but I do know someone decided this film should be a box-office fail.<br /><br />No toy line? Even \\"Avatar\\" had a toy line, and it wasn't a kids' flick.<br /><br />This movie had so much to offer, but it was set up to fail. Then the hyenas piled on, whooping and jeering about how they wouldn't ever have to hear about this movie again. You know the ones-- hipsters who LIVE online, to whom the \\"sword and planet\\" genre is unconscionable, who don't like anything unless there's an app for it. To understand what I'm talking about, all you have to do is visit the message boards over at IMDB.<br /><br />It is a good movie. I saw it twice in theaters-- once by myself, and once with my 7-year-old boy. He loved it. I mean LOVED it. Are you listening, Disney? I'm talking about your target demographic, here. He walked out of the theater explaining why certain things happened at the end of the movie so they could have a sequel. He wants a Thark. He wants all the toys.<br /><br />Oh wait, yeah. There ARE no toys. NO TOYS, for a $250 million DISNEY film? What's up with that? There aren't even t-shirts. And now Disney is short one executive, and I can't help wondering if the forced-fail of John Carter in the marketplace wasn't an inside maneuver...<br /><br />Oh well. I apologize for my conspiracy theory. I can say of the movie itself that, in the theater the CGI was so seamless you probably won't realize how much of what you are watching came out of a computer. If you're even remotely of the \\"steam punk\\" bent, you owe it to yourself to see \\"John Carter\\".<br /><br />If you like science fiction that is expansive and enveloping, you owe it to yourself to see \\"John Carter\\". And if you were a fan of the books, I can't imagine why you would stay away. \\"John Carter\\" defied the odds and made it to the big screen after 70 years of development hell. Respect that, if nothing else.<br /><br />When it comes out on Blu-ray, it's coming to my house, where my son and I can watch it again.
B007BVOF8E|3.0|While I loved the movie, even without having read the book to know the full story, it felt like the plot was overly compressed to fit within 2 hours. I watched it intently, but there were still a couple of developments in the plot, as done in the movie, that seemed like huge leaps, where the book must surely set it out better. So I'm now off to get the book and the BBC series, as it is such a great story, I want to get the full picture.

0802798225|5.0|See original post and much more on my blog!<br />[...]<br /><br />Oh man, Oh man. Honestly, at first I didn't know what I would get out of this book. While I love me some romance books, I also love a well laid out background on characters and a story line that flows - not bounces. Well I got all of that and more with this book. The characters were actually believable. Not this - \\"OMG that kind of stuff never happens in real life\\", kind of characters, but ones you can actually relate to because either you yourself have been through what they are going through, or you know someone who does. It makes feeling the emotions and understanding the issues that much more vivid when you are reading.<br /><br />Brittany - who doesn't want the \\"perfect\\" life? Although, we shouldn't have to pretend we have it, like Brittany does. Just like in her case, this just leads to a miserable person and a ton of issues. So what happens when that perfect life starts to fall apart? Here you have an amazing girl who is pretending to be this perfect person her parents want her to be, all while playing the hero to her disabled sister that gets no attention what.so.ever from parental figures. She has the perfect quarterback boyfriend, shes captain of the cheer squad and has a life everyone wants.. Or so they think.<br /><br />Alex - Lives on the \\"other side\\" of town. You know, the one where all the gang bangers and such live. Except, he's not what everyone makes him out to be. Yes, he is in a gang, yet, not for the reasons everyone things. He also isn't into drug selling, killing or any of the usual stuff that makes you this oh so feared person. Then fate, or whatever good thing was at work here, pairs Alex with Brittany in their Chemistry class - and the sparks begin to fly.<br /><br />Although watching Brittany fight this for as long as she did made me want to throw the book across the room sometimes, I see why she did it. The conflict she had within herself was epic. I can say this, because at one point in our lives, we have all been there - so I knew exactly how she felt. The heart wants what the heart wants, even when you head and the rest of the world thinks it's wrong.<br /><br />I loved the journey they went on. Watching Brittany let Alex into her life in a way she's let no one else in before, really helped you see just what was hiding behind the \\"Perfect Brittany.\\" You will fall in love with this story just as I did! I found myself rooting for these two over and over. Every obstacle that came their way proved to be nothing when it came to love. I just simply loved it.l been there - so I knew exactly how she felt.

I bulked at the price of owning a SIGNED copy if this amazing work of sci-fi fiction but am now adding it to the top of my Mother's Day list. Thank you Mr. Howey for the great read, you've made a fan for life!! I'm dying to read more of this series!
B006R6ZP6U|1.0|We only made it through about an hour of this. If you are expecting anything interesting or in depth about the brothers Grimm, forget it. This presentation, full of top notch actors, high budget scenes and effects, is nothing more than a child level cartoon. The \\"brothers\\" are buffoons, yet unworthy of any laughter. The famous stories of Hansel and Gretel, Red Riding Hood, Rapunzel etc are trotted out briefly in magic laden scenes that simply serve as opportunities for more buffoonery by the brothers. Skip it.
B007UXSDYU|1.0|I should have listened to the other reviews. According to IMDB it only made over $20,000, how is that possible? Well if you watch this movie you will understand why. Watch it on HBO or paid cable. I don't recommned this movie to anyone.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I read this series because I want to keep an eye on what my kids are reading. I really enjoyed most of it, but as a 41 year old dad, didn't connect much with the \\"who should she choose\\" stuff. I really liked the way the author created the confict of personal choice within the extremes of the districts and the Capitol. People in both settings had to make decisions around moral/ethical subjects and there were examples of good and bad choices in both settings.<br /><br />I recommend reading this series.

Lets try to break down the facts:<br /><br />1.  This is a pure rip off of Twilight.  No one needed to point out to me that this was at one point free garbage online for women obsessed with the Twilight series.  If you read the book, you notice it right away.  Christian is Edward, if Edward was human, an abuser, and even more stalkerish than the original.  Ana is Bella, a character who needs a backbone.  The plot, the characters, everything is based off of Twilight.  If you want to publish original work- MAKE YOUR OWN CHARACTERS.<br /><br />2.  NO ONE has this much sex.  Give me a break, do you really need 2,3,4 scences a chapter.  I get the point.  I'm not a hot and horny teenager.  I am a mom.  Who enjoys a little action, but I would also like A STORY!<br /><br />3.  THIS IS A BOOK BASED ON ROMANTICISING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE!  Christian is abusive.  Their love is based off of abuse.  This book does nothing but tell young woman that don't worry about your STALKER boyfriend, it's really his way of showing you that he loves you.  RUN GIRLS!  RUN!  If you are reading this book and it starts to make you think about your current boyfriend...  RUN!<br /><br />4.  She's a horrible writer.  Obviously she took more than just the characters from Stephanie Meyers.<br /><br />Off to go read \\"I am NOT your victim\\" from Beth Sipe.

0393327345|4.0|This is one of those very, very rare occasions wherein the movie was actually better than the book (in my opinion). Not to say that FIGHT CLUB isn't an artful and skillfully crafted novel, it is. Mostly I think it came down to the simple fact that the movie just flat out had more meat to it...Or maybe I'm just biased because I loved the movie so much; that the small differences in the book caused it to fall slightly short in comparison, and yes I'm aware the book came first, but the film definitely improved on the books genius.<br /><br />So, would I reread the book again?... probably not, this was more of a quick one time read, but I've seen the movie more times than I can count.  In the end I'd say I thoroughly enjoyed FIGHT CLUB, the creative and fast paced novel, but was blown away by the action packed twisted mind screw that is FIGHT CLUB the movie.<br />FIGHT CLUB = Great book... Outstanding film.<br />\\"This is your life and its ending one moment at a time.\\"~Chuck Palahniuk
1451648537|1.0|This is one of the worst books I have ever read. Even made for TV movies have a better narrative. I pre-ordered the book. Read it during the weekend after it arrived.    Half of the stories read like a rip-off from Andy Hertzfield's blog <[...]>. The other half are  anecdotes few and far between. You never get a sense of who Steve Jobs was, other than stories about him from a third person who knew him. I read that Steve gave extensive interviews to Walter Isaacson before his untimely passing, hoping that Isaacson would do some justice to his story. If this is supposed to be Steve's legacy, the book has failed terribly.    To put into perspective, this is more like MobileMe than iCloud.
B004TSXUWY|3.0|Very interesting read and well written. Great ending although pretty easy to work out the twist! All in all definitely kept me turning the pages!!
B005IQZB14|5.0|I highly recommend this book! Loved how Cheryl is brutally honest about herself, and how she brought you along her journey, just as if you were back-packing with her along the PCT. Yet, this isn't just a story about a 1,200 mile hike. It's a person's pursuit of digging deeper than you ever thought possible, and having something to prove to your toughest critic: yourself. How often can any one of us say that just putting one foot in front of the other seems like an insurmountable task? Yet what choice do you make? You keep moving forward and trust that eventually you'll find the trail again.<br />Cheryl used humor in places it didn't seem possible to find any, and was quick to point out how unprepared she was. What a great metaphor for life where we all have our own \\"trail\\" we have to walk!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|hours of fun!!!!!! a little weird how.the.point system.works though. I'm sure everyone will find lots of fun in this game
0439023491|4.0|This book is action packed!  The twist of Katniss once again having to enter the arena was captivating.  This arena wasn't quite as good as the representation in the last one since there was almost to much intricacy and detail.  But the book is still amazing and I definitely recommend reading it!
0345803485|4.0|I am a nosy person by nature, I can't help myself. When people are talking I have to know what they are talking about. If someone has a secret I have to find out what it is. It's in my blood I can't change it (not that I've tried). So when everyone was talking about Fifty Shades of Grey I had to know what the fuss was all about. I have never been a fan of Erotica but I couldn't be the only kid at the playground that hasn't read this series. So I picked up my copy with full intentions of hating it. Eh, ya, I was wrong.<br /><br />Let's start off with the leading man Christian Grey; he is hansom, charming, rich, and a complete control freak. Everything about Christian screams head case, he is controlling possessive and everything I would hate in a guy, and yet I am completely in love with him. I would go so far to say Christian Grey can control me any day. Christian has a ton of baggage and I loved learning about him, his world, and his secrets, it captivated me. I was like a crack head and Christian Grey was my drug of choice, I couldn't get enough of him.<br /><br />Anastasia Steele the leading lady is innocent, smart, and anything but submissive. I honestly had moments in the story where I was yelling at her, and wishing she would just give into Mr. Grey's request. I couldn't tell you why I wanted Ana to become submissive, I am normally all about female empowerment, but Fifty Shades has cast a spell on me causing me to cheer for the wrong side. Ana's character is slightly immature and that did get under my skin a little bit. Ana has a bad habit of over analyzing, and making a mountain out of a mole hill, or a beating out of a spanking but who am I to judge.<br /><br />This book did have a few things I didn't care for but over all I couldn't put it down. I didn't really like how the author embellished her words; at some points in the story I had to break out that old book with Webster written on the front, wipe off the dust, and look up the words. With that said Overall the storyline is addicting, and I love watching the chemistry between the characters build. I found myself lost in the world of Christian and Ana, searching for other addicts to talk to about the story.<br /><br />I did notice the Twilight comparison everyone was talking about but only with a few things, the storyline is nothing like Twilight. Ana is a klutz like Bella, and she bites her lip constantly like Bella did. Christian is a controlling father like figure in the same way Edward was. None of the comparisons took away from the story for me, in fact I would have never noticed had a million people not told me.<br /><br />I recommend this novel for adult readers only. Keep an open mind it is only a story.rall the storyline is addicting, and I love watching the chemistry between the characters build.

0439023513|5.0|After I finished the first book in the hunger game series I was tempted to read some reviews on the next 2 books in the sires which I never do, do to the ever present spoiler content. To say that I was very concerned with all the negative reviews I saw and more than a little worried about my expectations of the trilogy would be putting it simply but let's leave it there. When I proceeded to read the 2nd book and consequently devoured the 3rd I understood yet wildly disagreed with most if not all negative reviews.<br /><br />In the 2nd book the writer shows us that the capital has caught itself in its own trap, while trying to squash the rebellion katniss has started, every move it makes pushes the rebels into action. Then the twist with the hunger games this year being past victors is like the icing on the cake for most districts and it lunches them in to action. It's the straw that breaks the camel's back a back already cracked by katniss in the first book. This time around the game if it's possible is even crueler. In the end it leaves katniss and the reader in limbo and you really don't know where anybody's loyalties lie.<br /><br />The 3nd book which must reviewers take as slow to me was a necessary bridge in the trilogy, one that shows us Katniss's weaknesses and her disturbed feelings. We have to take into account that this is a 16 year old that was first forced and expected to kill others, after this when she thinks she's out of the frying pan she's tossed into the fire in the second games, then she's ripped apart from the boy she is trying to give her life for and is expected to lend her voices to a war she does not fully understand and is not in charge of at any point. She is simply the face others turn to for inspiration. If readers thought for a second that she was going to come out of this ware they were only fooling themselves there's no possible way for any self respecting author to end this book with they lived happy ever after. War is hard on soldiers they come back changed and not usually for the better I think in the end katniss was able to salvage a lot of what was left of her life even after * Spoiler* seeing her baby sister (the one she was basically giving her life for in book one) blown to bits with a boom designed by her bestfriend.* END Spoiler*  I think anybody in her shoes would be shell shocked if not traumatized. And poor Peeta had to go throw brain washing to the point of not knowing what's real and what's fake.  And still readers expected it to be all roses. This trilogy accomplished a lot for a teen novel it has good characters a good story line.  It does not sugar coat life or war it is what it is, all you can do in the end after all the dead are gone is try to put your life back together as much as possible and I think this book got that point across very well.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|50 Shades of Grey is a tamer version of The Story of O.  In 50, our heroine is bright and although torn by the circumstances in which she finds herself, she presents a persona in which she clearly takes time to consider the ramifications of her actions.  Written on the level of a young teen, the author uses the word \\"clambered\\" so often it becomes a distraction.  Enjoyable but certainly not worthy of distinction.

B004S3X9ZS|5.0|It was my new cousin Pip from England who introduced me to Metronomy. They are the type of band where you can honestly say they create a musical atmosphere you can really fall under the spell of. Sadly,especially in America,a lot of cultural negativity has somewhat kept the progress of pop music stilted for over a decade. Even during very anti dance music eras such as the early 80's (post disco years) and early 90's (alternative rock years) bands in Europe were still innovating in the dance,electronic and funk music other elements of the culture were rejected. With the advent of indie pop,they actually got what you might call a fighting chance to be...sometimes next to incredible. This multi sexual,multi racial band from Devon England are led by singer/songwriter/multi instrumentalist Joseph Mount. From the get go it's clear their sound was based in electronica. But one look into their history Mount has remixed songs for many people from the Gorillaz to Lady Gaga. So it's only appropriate on this,their debut album that something special was bound to happen.<br /><br />  The overall sound of this album is imaginative and dreamy. It's by no means slow and trippy either. The title track,something of an intro is a moody string based orchestral piece before going into \\"We Broke Free\\",a simple pop number with some...less than simple 80's new wave style synthesizer washes and \\"Everything Goes My Way\\". This song,sung by female singer/drummer AnnaPrior reminds me of a band called Papa's Frita's,a much earlier indie band who made some music that might've helped influenced Metronomy from the sound of things. \\"The Look\\" has this organ powered,spare rock and soul sound that is very poppy and somehow unique as well. \\"She Wants\\" adds a bit of a slow ska/funk flavor to it. Very much from the early Talking Heads/Police school but again more stripped down than either. \\"Trouble\\" brings a doo-wop type rhythm into play while \\"The Bay\\" showcases the disco/funk influence that is in the shadow somewhere on a lot of this album. \\"Loving Arm\\" has a sound where bubbling electronics combine to form different rhythmic patterns. A very compelling sound.<br /><br />  After the somewhat more pop/rock oritened \\"Corrine\\" the closers \\"Some Written and \\"Love Underlines\\" use the same idea of electronic sounds blended together to create spare,rhythmic epics that are less instrumentally theatrical than the Gorillaz but less musically dense. Joseph Mount is really onto something with Metronomy on this album. I haven't heard any of their older albums yet. On the other hand,speaking from this alone they have the potential to be musical innovators. I understand that in this day and age most music made primarily for the purposes of art is somewhat lodged in the underground. Where much commercial music is again encouraged to be very non experimental. This is not by any means universal law. But with Mount's connections to the pop world Metronomy are a band of a type that could easily be both musically potent and commercially successful. Anyway for a band I knew nothing about until a few weeks ago,they have my interest. And they also present a jumping off point (via Wikipedia and YouTube) for the musically curious to seek out others either involved or on a similar creative path. Something worth looking into.adow somewhere on a lot of this album. \\"Loving Arm\\" has a sound where bubbling electronics combine to form different rhythmic patterns.

B003L77G6A|5.0|Hilarious! each episode is funnier than the next! This is a must-have series. Consider buying season 1, 2, & 3 also.
B0052RE4MQ|1.0|Matched was such an exciting novel(I recommended it to everyone i know) that i couldn't wait to get my hands on Crossed! Then i got it.....and it was horrible, I couldn't finish it. I didn't like how the author flip flopped back and forth between characters. She wrote both of them in the same way I couldn't tell who was who. I had to flip back to the beginning of the chapter just to remember.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|Fun game. It does unfortunately have some pay to play characteristics, but not nearly as many as other glu developed games. Enjoying it for now.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|it was a very good product kind of like frontierville for the kindle fire without the need for facebook games
B007SYWFRM|4.0|love it however after shutting game down next time I open it is locked up and I have to always turn kindle fire off then back on for game to work properly. which really is a pain to do.
140053271X|5.0|I like my Nook. No, I love it. I'm sure Kindle is good too but this was in my price range and can read PDF and epub. I've read so  much on this thing since I bought it and I can't stress enough how much I don't miss hardback books. Those things were heavy! I suppose if I wanted to look at lovely color illustrations I go back to my paper books but as far as I'm concerned, most of my reading is done on this now.<br />No, you can't play games on it but you can read on it and that's what an ereader is for. :)

B0009S4IHY|5.0|This is an outrageously funny parody of every martial arts movie you've ever seen (though none in particular).  If you thought Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon was a bit over the top, you'll love this movie.
B00753MBHA|4.0|Accept's latest album, Stalingrad, continues the German metal band's amazing comeback. There's more emphasis on raging tempos and anthems this time and less on longer dramatic epics. Wolf Hoffman's guitar work is his best since the band's mid-80's glory years and Mark Tornillo's commanding vocals are now so distinct that you no longer think of him as just Udo Dirkschneider's replacement. \\"Hung Drawn and Quartered\\" is a wicked opener for a band that has a lot of them while the title track is a grower with a few changes in tempo and mood and an excellent solo from Hoffman. \\"Hellfire\\" is a solid mid-tempo rocker while \\"Flash to Bang Time\\" may be their heaviest track since \\"Fast as a Shark\\". \\"Shadow Soldiers\\" is a good anthem with a march beat and a memorable chorus. At this point, Stalingrad is a solid but not spectacular disc. Then \\"Revolution\\" kicks in and takes the album to another level. Providing an excellent balance between its furious pace and the band's trademark warlike backing vocals, this is the finest song on the album. \\"Against The World\\", \\"Never Forget\\", and \\"Twist of Fate\\" are all strong anthems with memorable choruses while \\"The Quick and the Dead\\" is super heavy and like \\"Flash to Bang Time\\" is more speed metal. \\"The Galley\\" is a good dramatic closer that has a long and quieter outro.  Since this doesn't contain a knockout track or two, I wouldn't put this on the level of their best work (on the last album, the knockouts were \\"Teutonic Terror\\" and the title song). Still, this is a strong release from Accept and I'd highly recommend it.
B007R41E8O|5.0|With the amount of people who had no issue downloading the game, you would think others would first look for a problem on their end--you know, crappy wi-fi, device timeouts, and so on--before trashing a company and its product. But nope. One-star reviews it is!<br /><br />My rule of thumb is to take any one-star review as a review not of the product itself but of the reviewer's intelligence.<br /><br />Anyway, Twisted Lands is an excellent game. A standard point-and-click mystery, very much like Fire Maple's [[ASIN:B0073LWEXK The Lost City]] and [[ASIN:B004FOA84A The Secret of Grisly Manor]], though much longer and with a good dose of hidden-object gaming. So a bit of a hybrid.<br /><br />The storyline is interesting but rather shallow as it's not really necessary for a game like this to have depth. The graphics are great, though the human rendering is a bit too 90s CGI at times. But again, it doesn't matter much for a game like this. There is also some animation, which is different.<br /><br />Some puzzles were a bit tricky, but overall it wasn't too difficult. The puzzle solutions were logical, though the reason they even exist is not. That seems standard for this sort of game as well. Focus on the how, not the why, you know.<br /><br />Either way, I have no complaints at all. For the price, you could do a hell of a lot worse. Great game!<br /><br />FYI: There are ads when you first start the game, but if you click the little icon in the upper left-hand corner they go away.
B00000JBFW|4.0|Deep Purple made a big comeback with Perfect Strangers and this album has aged well over the years. No, it's not on par with classics like Made in Japan or Machine Head but it's still very good and there's not a bad song in the bunch. The singles/videos from this album are killer as \\"Knocking at Your Back Door\\" has a great hook with Jon Lord's organ line and Ian Gillan's kooky yet clever lyric. The mid-tempo title track is perhaps the most known song here and has another great hook in the organ/guitar line. \\"Nobody's Home\\" was also a video and features a memorable chorus and great organ lines from Lord. Not to be overlooked is guitar whiz Ritchie Blackmore whose guitar work is excellent throughout, particularly on \\"Under the Gun\\" and the slower paced \\"Wasted Sunsets\\" and \\"Son of Alerik\\". Other strong tracks include the fast paced \\"A Gypsy's Kiss\\", the hard hitting \\"Not Responsible\\", and the cool story song that is \\"Mean Streak\\". Perfect Strangers was a welcome addition to the Deep Purple catalog and only enhanced their legend.

B004LUHQ1G|4.0|I owned the Foo Fighters' first two albums (Foo Fighters and The Colour and the Shape, respectively) but the radio tracks from their last few albums didn't grab me enough to go out and purchase them. However, between all the positive reviews and hearing the singles \\"Walk\\", \\"These Days\\", and \\"Rope\\" nearly every day on the radio, I broke down and picked up Wasting Light. I'm glad I did. This is a great modern rock album with a strong production. As for the singles, \\"Rope\\" is one of a few tunes that you can call both catchy and brutal. The staccato riff is a killer as is the band's performance. \\"Walk\\" and \\"These Days\\" are more melodic and really grow on you both lyrically and musically over repeated listens. The songs \\"Arlandria\\" and \\"Dear Rosemary\\" are excellent tracks and are on the same level (maybe better) than the singles as the former has the best chorus on the album and the latter is a hard rock track with a great hook in the guitar line and a touch of sadness in the lyrics. Other highlights include the wicked \\"White Limo\\", the chugging opener \\"Bridge Burning\\", and the catchy tunes \\"A Matter of Time\\" and \\"Back & Forth\\".  The only misstep on the album is the dramatic \\"I Should Have Known\\" which comes off as repetitive and draggy even if it has some fine moments. Take this song off and it's an easy 5-star album. All told, Wasting Light is great and worth the purchase.

B002MQYOFW|3.0|I really did want to like this book, but I can't help but feel the marketing machine and the popularity of the book tricked me and thousands of others.<br /><br />It takes quite a bit of skill to pull off a first-person narrative, and Collins struggled to create the suspense necessary to carry the book because of being locked into voice of the lead character, Katniss. The book plods along slowly as its sets the stage for this showdown in the arena, which is largely uninteresting and rushed. The plot had so much potential but just fell flat with a wooden lead and a writing style that made me want to just hurry up and end it all. If I could've found some nightlock berries, I might would have eaten them to end it all more quickly.<br /><br />I am giving this book 3 stars (an average rating) because perhaps my expectations were so high due to the way this book has been hyped, but if I had never heard of this book before, it would've received 1-2 stars. I'm definitely not reading the next books in the series as finding out what might happen Katniss' droll life just doesn't interest me. Keep your money. Save your time.

The power of experience to heal. The suggestion that thought is critical in maintaining health.  The existance of parallel lives rather than a linear concept of reincarnation. The question of the local of awareness when the body is in a coma state yet still aware.  Wonderful opportunities to expand our view of who we are, what we are, and what are we doing here anyway.

B0014BY72Q|3.0|I first saw \\"Logan's Run\\" (1976) when I was a hippy in my twenties and thought the film was so mind-boggling, man! I have remembered that movie all these years and was delighted when its title popped up as a movie choice recently. \\"Logan's Run\\" was a shocking disappointment, but it does have redeeming features.<br /><br />First, an overview:<br /><br />Michael York plays hedonistic Logan, a \\"Sandman\\" who puts people to \\"sleep,\\" or euphenism for regulated, national policeman whose job is to kill \\"runners.\\" The story takes place way in the future where life is simple except for those who want to live beyond 30. Population is controlled: one death equals one new life.<br /><br />When a group reaches 30, they become required candidates for \\"renewing,\\" a process never explained. Basically, they are eliminated in a laser-operated carousel of sorts. They dress in white like Greeks but wear masks reminiscent or prescient of Scream masks. The audience cheers when each one is \\"renewed\\" or zapped out of existence.<br /><br />During one of Logan's routine returns of things taken from runners, one item is an ankh, a symbol for Sanctuary or Afterlife, where runners go. At this point they re-assign him to run so that he can send word to other Sandman to come eliminate those runners. Each person has a crystal inserted in his hand at birth. When that horrible 30 arrive, the crystal turns red. Sandman won't agree unless they give him back the four years he has left before he really becomes 30. He is never guaranteed anything, but he goes.<br /><br />He takes Jessica with him, a supposed prostitute who just came on the \\"circuit.\\" but she is reluctant to participate. Later they meet again and their attraction develops. She agrees to help him find Sanctuary only if she can come with him. What they find is so shocking to them--the truth!<br /><br />Positive aspects:<br />1. One device Logan carries resembles an iPhone! Most impressive for 1976. Do you think Steve Jobs found his idea there?<br />2. Other special effects were amazing for the time!<br />3. The central idea of the story--running to prevent termination<br />4. By film's end Logan and Jessica have established themselves as Beloved Husband and Beloved Wife, unknown terms or the relationship behind the terms heretofore.<br /><br />Problems:<br />1. Logan and Jessica were gone from the dome for several days. Not once did they eat or complain of hunger.<br />2. The haircuts, especially Logan's, were ghastly.

At the end of their domed world, all these young people have to make their way in this wild, untamed world and seem to have no skills except hedonistic ones.<br />7.

B0072OFM28|5.0|I have to say that after reviewing  season 2, I loved it!! I think that given the weight of what is obviously a daunting task, Liam stepped up and did a fine job.  Granted, Andy gave us a different feel for Spartacus and will never be forgotten for the wonderful job that he did, but I am glad that the show has continued and overall, this cast did a great job.  It took me a little time to get used to the new Naevia, but I think that Cynthia Addai-Robinson was able to really capture the necessary growth that the character had to deal with and rise to become her own person. I especially enjoyed when she was able to grab her own bit of vengeance. She stood as tall as a giant when she did what she had to do and really got the respect of the whole group and showed that she was not helpless. I was watching the replay of episode 10 at 1:30 in the morning and was literally screaming for her as she got some get back.  GREAT JOB!! Don't get me wrong, I thought that Lesley-Ann Brandt really did a wonderful job as Naevia in the first couple of seasons and really brought to life the love story between her and Crixus (which by the way, is one of the main reasons why I tune in, because I love them as a couple).But I wholeheartedly appreciate what Cynthia did for this season as Naevia grew as a woman.  And then, of course,there are my two favorite ladies, Ilythia and Lucretia.  It just would not be as fun  without the machinations of these two, who make doing bad things very interesting to watch, especially since the two of them have absolutely no moral compass and are literally slaves to their own desires, whatever they might be.  I also enjoyed Crixus' evolution.  Crixus has always been one of my favorites on the show and to watch the depth of this man unfold on so many different levels.....Bravo Manu Bennett.  All in all, my recommendation is to purchase this Season of Spartacus Vengeance.  You will DEFINATELY be entertained!!

0545265355|5.0|i wanted to read the book before going to see the movie...the package arrived quickly after placing my order, and then got into the business of reading the three books...hard to put down when you get started! ...had a couple of nights in a row staying up after 3 am just to find out what happened next! ...great packaging as well!
B007ONSLLQ|5.0|The songs included on The Strange Case Of... are excellent from beginning to end.  When the band mentioned in interviews leading up to the release of the album that the album was different, the heavier songs heavier and the softer songs softer, I was slightly skeptical, in most cases that's code for a band trying to find a more mainstream sound and radio success.  However, that's not the case here, the hard songs have even more edge than their debut album, the ballads are beautifully written (though I wish they had included one with a haunting \\"Familiar Taste Of Poison\\" type sound), and there's enough songs to fill the space in between to keep the album from feeling too bipolar.  The song writing shows growth in my opinion, musically and vocally the album sounds like a step up compared to their debut album.  There really isn't a bad song on the album, but the two songs that stand out to me the most are \\"I Miss The Misery\\" and \\"Here's To Us\\".  If you liked Halestorm's debut album you'll definitely enjoy this album, the band has definitely evolved but hasn't changed too much.  Haven't had a chance to see the new songs live yet but they sound like they'll translate very well to being performed live.<br /><br />I have two complaints about the album, neither of which say anything about the quality of the songs included.  The first is that the deluxe version of the album at this time is only available if you buy the physical disc.  Like many, I gave up on buying physical CDs a few years ago.  Why not make the deluxe version available for everyone, not just the people willing to still buying physical CDs?  Luckily Amazon had the album on sale right after it came out so it was a good deal and I'll probably pick up the extra tracks once they're available for download but it's still annoying.  Second complaint, I'm not a fan of the order of the songs on the album.  Three slow songs in a row is too much, they should have saved one of them for the second to last song (\\"Here's To Us is a great closer) and put a heavier song after the other two, after slowing it down I think it works best for albums to bring it right back to something heavy and \\"Rock Show\\" is a little too mid-tempo in my opinion.<br /><br />Other than the lack of digital deluxe version and order of songs, no complaints about the album.  Halestorm is one of the best \\"new\\" bands out there and this album is a great addition to the music they have already released.o Us is a great closer) and put a heavier song after the other two, after slowing it down I think it works best for albums to bring it right back to something heavy and \\"Rock Show\\" is a little too mid-tempo in my opinion.<br /><br />Other than the lack of digital deluxe version and order of songs, no complaints about the album.

0399159029|5.0|Kerr has written another compelling Gunther story.  The plot was wickedly tight and twisted, the characters came out of history with the stench of Nazism on them.<br /><br />These novels are horrifying and impossible to put down.  One of the most striking element is the plausibility and realism in the way that Kerr intertwines history with his story.  His research efforts show in the way he sets the stage.<br /><br />I'm now waiting impatiently for the next episode in Bernie's life.<br /><br />Thanks Mr Kerr.
B0045EJY90|3.0|My fault, I guess. I should have looked more closely. I was looking for a replacement for my Sony 500C (yes, the doors jam after a while)to record CD's from cassette tape. This wasn't it. It records only USB devices. Not what I needed.

B007NPLHUW|5.0|Hi everyone that loves Lost Girl!<br />I'd just like to point out that it's bloody absurd to offer Reg 4 DVDs on the US website when Reg 1 is avaliable through Amazon.ca (Canada).<br />Ridiculous!<br />I think it's reasonable to wait until the first season has run it's course on SyFy before they release it in the US.<br />Do NOT get stuck with non Reg 1!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is very addicting and my kids love to play it as well but would rather me play it
B006XIR9KM|3.0|this game is okay at times but after playing for just a couple min you start to get tired of doing the same thing over again. the only sufferance of each level is that it adds a new kind of block
B005RUV0NY|5.0|I was skeptical when my brother told me about this show, because he has been very wrong in the past, but after watching the first episode, I was hooked. I bought each episode, one after another, realizing it ws 3:00am in the morning, I decided to buy season 2 the next day. I am not a fan of scary movies, because you always expect when something is going to jump out at you, but this had me curled up in a ball, like a school girl, jumping at every moment. Soo awesome and somewhat realistic. Best Zombie spin off I have ever seen.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I am not usually a King fan but I found this book to be a fun ride and hard to put down. It makes we aware of how my everyday actions affect all around me.
B004LWZW88|5.0|One word.. FUNNY! I could not stop laughing from the moment this movie started all the way to the end. Nice for kids to enjoy, and great for parents to have to sit through.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|I got this app when it was free.  But would have definitely paid for it!  Easy to set up but still cant get it to work when I'm not on my network.  I admittedly have not contracted support.
B000J10KTQ|5.0|I can't believe i let this movie slip under my radar!<br /><br />I never watched this movie when it originally came out in '06, i was busy being interested in anime and foreign flicks. One day last year i saw part of this movie on FX in standard definition, and it was quite well done, enthralling to say the least. So when i was going through the list of HD DVDs for sale (for dirt cheap), i noticed this jewel of a bargain. HD DVD format combo with a DVD on the flip side is great if u don't have the super rare optical drive or Toshiba player, and if u have the HD DVD player like me then prepared to be wowed with 1080p Full HD picture, 5.1 dolby TRUE HD surround sound, 10 deleted scenes, featurettes and joke takes. This is one of the best examples of HD DVD i've seen since King Kong!<br /><br />Visual effects are state of the art, beginning with the supernova of Krypton's sun, and later with the Superman hero effects. By far the best superhero movie i have ever seen, and i don't even care. Musical score is a combo of classic Superman homage, and a new theme scored for the Man of Steel make this flick credible and a real pleasure to watch. Brandon Routh is a worthy successor to Christopher Reeve (+Rest In Peace+). Lex Luthor played by Kevin Spacey could have been a little more actively criminal. Homage to Marlon Brando was decent. Hope Bryan Singer can be involved in a sequel if they ever get around to it...<br /><br />Well worth the $10 if you've got the player.<br /><br />UPDATE! (05/20/14)<br />Just bought and watched the 3D version of MAN OF STEEL (2013).<br />I must say, even though Superman Returns makes u feel good to watch, Man of Steel tops it as far as making Superman credible, i had to pick my jaw up off the floor when i finished watching that spectacle...

B000E41MS6|5.0|I saw some of the shows on tv from different seasons and decided to watch it from the first \\"new doctor\\". I have to say I was so glad that I bought the series, I get to watch them whenever I want to. The stories are so good this is what family entertainment is all about. There is no season I don't like.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I have never felt compelled to write a book review and certainly not a review for a book that doesn't deserve even one star, but for this book, I must.  The author of this book has forgotten the basic elements to any book, namely good characters and an intriguing plot.  Instead, this author simply wrote for the shock value with scenes that could only be sold in a porn shop had this book been a movie.  I am all for a Romance novel, I love a good love story with a dashing hero or a witty heroine.  This book has characters so shallow and debase that you simply don't care at all what happens to them.  As for writing a trilogy with these characters, I wouldn't waste my money or time.  It's too bad too, it's a GREAT title, and the cover even draws the male crowd in, but you know what they say about judging a book by it's cover.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it the best game I have or should i say best 101 gamed I have beat the whole first page
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Just one word.... Awesome.... Well maybe two words, Awesome and Unexpected!<br />Can't wait for the next installment... Reminds me of the anticipation I felt waiting for the next Dark Tower novel.......
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This book was the most erotic book I have ever read!I was shocked! I almost stopped reading it!  However, there was also an intriguing mystery to it that drew in my interest!  I had to purchase the last two books to find out what happened to make \\"Grey\\" who he is. I think the author could have eliminated a lot of the explicit S & M sex. I found that I skimmed over some sections after awhile. I was sick of yet another graphically written sexual part! However,  the mystery to the character \\"Grey\\" made me want to keep reading.  I admit it, I couldn't put it down!
B003HV0TN2|5.0|This is one of the best books! I just couldn't put it down.<br /><br />I read at night before I got to bed and every day I looked forward to going to bed and reading!<br /><br />It was such a joy and such a page turner - an edge of seat experience!<br /><br />Can't wait to read book 2 and 3 =D
B006CS7UXO|5.0|Format picks up where the previous B sides compilation Alternative left off. Starting with 1996's Bilingual and closing after 2009's Yes, Format again showcases the wealth and depth of material not included in official albums.<br /><br />If you are looking for variety, you'll be greatly rewarded for buying this:<br /><br />Signature Pet Shop Boys dance tracks like Delusions Of Grandeur and Sexy Northerner.<br /><br />Garage disco includes Disco Potential and The Truck Driver And His Mate performed in the Somewhere Pet Shop Boys In Concert DVD.<br /><br />Girls Don't Cry. A witty reply to The Cure's Boys Don't Cry.<br /><br />Betrayed, a Bossa Novish piece mixed with a little trance.<br /><br />I Didn't Get Where I Am Today. A sunny cheery drive away song.<br /><br />Confidential, originally intended for Tina Turner, is an easy listening piece that grows on you.<br /><br />Hit And Miss is a melancholic mid tempo ditty with an uncharacteristic guitar. The result is fantastic.<br /><br />In Private, originally sung with Dusty Springfield in the 80s, turned into a soaring Elton John collaboration.<br /><br />The Calm Before The Storm. A little gem that will fit very well as a theatre piece.<br /><br />Beautiful ballads such as Friendly Fire and Between Two Islands really got to me.<br /><br />One thing to note. On disc one, tracks one to 12 (minus Confidential) can be found on Bilingual Further Listening.<br /><br />If you are into design, don't download this. Format comes beautifully packaged in a box set with separate envelopes for the discs and a booklet featuring the Boys' commentary on all tracks.<br /><br />The above are just some worthy mentions. Format contains a total of 38 songs, making this a must have item for fans. As for me, I'm completely enamoured!
B007MDB71O|4.0|I have seen this movie three times, still trying to find what the heck the so-called movie critics are complaining about.  All I could see at fault was the omission of \\"Of Mars\\" for the ad campaign (or lack of). Actually, they added this at the end of the movie, which make more sense in referring to Carter's preference.<br />So, without repeating comments from people who actually saw the movie, I highly recommend this.  Looking forward to a longer theatrical re-release with deleted scenes, and sequels.  Good job Andrew Stanton, cast and crew!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Im Evelyn and Im ten years of age. When I first heard of the Hunger Games I had no idea what is was about...just the fact that it is extremely famous.<br />  I have read all 3 books and I loved them to death. The way Collins writes its astounding..she makes you care for the characters.<br />  This serious belongs on the same line as Harry Potter..in my case the best series ever made. I am a writer and you need to realize how hard it is to find an idea as brilliant. Thats why I love it so much.<br />  I wish I could comment alot on the characters..like The Star Crossed Lovers From District 12. Peeta and Katniss seem like a great couple..but surprises happen.<br />  .SPOILER.<br />Sort of how Peeta strangled Katniss in the 3rd book. No one could of expected that.
0393080269|5.0|I cannot remember ever reading a book about the global economy and markets written with such clarity and perspective.  I couldn't put this book down.  Ruchir Sharma cuts through with elegance and simplicity to the underpinnings of what makes the major emerging markets tick, but the real treat here is that he does it in such a clear and entertaining fashion.  He is superbly nuanced in his presentation of the interesting but different dynamics of each emerging market economy, with very clear, well-researched and persuasive arguments.  And he is unafraid to stand conventional wisdom on its head in the process.  An absolute must-read.

B001NLKT60|5.0|This is another Stieg Larsson at his best.  Just like with his first book, I couldn't put it down.  After reading \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\",  I already knew the characters and how they related.  Intense yet enjoyable.  Wish there were a dozen more.
B007SSDDWE|4.0|A unique film set entirely in Russia.<br />The special effects were very good and once the movie got past the basic premise, the action was non-stop.<br />The movie was much better than I expected.

B005IQZB14|5.0|\\"Wild\\" by Cheryl Strayed is a book that I had a hard time putting down once I started reading. At the age of 26, Ms. Strayed has just moved through a very difficult time in her life. Her mother has recently died at the age of 45, her siblings have scattered, her step-father has remarried, and her marriage has fallen apart largely due to the choices she has made. At this point in her life, she seems like a ping pong ball just bouncing from one thing to another - multiple moves, multiple jobs - and does things without planning or considering the consequences. She reacts without thinking through things most of the time. She sees a book on the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) and decides this long hike is just what she needs. Needless to say, as with most things in her life, she doesn't adequately plan or prepare for the journey. As just one example, she packs everything in her backpack for the first time right before leaving and finds she can't even lift it due to its weight. Not a guide to the trail or a \\"how to\\" on long distance hiking, this book is a memoir of her life leading up to the trip as well as the hike itself. In the closing pages, she reveals what her life is like now so there is closure to the story.<br /><br />Being a planner myself and very organized, there were many times I found myself frustrated with the immaturity and lack of planning on her part. She created many of her own messes and many of her problems were preventable. I am also fairly conservative and had difficulty understanding the drug use and promiscuity evident throughout. You would think based upon what I just said that I would hate the book when just the opposite is true. While I couldn't relate to much of what she did, I still have to give her huge kudos for courage and sheer guts. Many of her decisions along the way were a direct result of immaturity and emotional pain. While I personally doubt I would have handled things the way she did, I can still respect her experience and the inner strength she possessed to get through what she did. This is an honest, open look at one woman's life with nothing held back.<br /><br />A journal of personal pain and the growth that comes from that along with an incredibly told story of a huge physical challenge - this is one book I enjoyed reading from beginning to end.ngth she possessed to get through what she did.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|This was a great series.  I got so wrapped up in the story that I couldn't put the book down! I would be laughing one minute, almost embarassed to keep reading another, and then crying like a baby the next. Your emotions get so wrapped up in this story, great series!!!<br /><br />Can't wait to see if it comes out in a movie like they are talking.
0761169253|5.0|I am not a creative person. I want to be. I think like most people I want to create something. I want to write something. Create something. While searching for something new in the books section of  Amazon.com I hit on this title. I knew nothing about Austin Kleon. I am not a poetry fan so I did not know about the Newspaper Blackout book. I actually judged this book by it's cover (and the description to be honest). I read it in an hour (you can too - it is a short book). Then I read it again much more slowly and with a highlighter. Most of what he writes about may be trite to those \\"in the know\\" but for me this book said I could go into the world, find something I love and tweak it bit to make it mine. And in doing that I could show the creator that his work inspired me to create something. This book also told me that I already possessed the tools to be creative. Since I know that I like Kleon suggest that I study why I like it. Find out what makes it work for me and then use that as a jumping off point. But even these words do not convey accurately enough how inspired I was - I read it again - I added his blog and tumblr feeds to my daily readings - I follow him on twitter and bought some books he recommended. Finally - rather than sending him an email telling him how wonderful this book is - I am following his advice and putting those same thoughts in a review. A small book awakened a bit of passion for being creative. Not a small feat. A small book but a big heart. Hope all these words add up to this - I love this book.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|This version is way beyond awesome...over 90+ levels. I have few freezes every now and then but in sure this will be corrected in the future.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love the MSG version of the Holy Bible.  Nice for church and Bible study work.  Happy that I downloaded it...:)
0439023513|5.0|I know there were a lot of split reviews about this final book in The Hunger Games trilogy so let me start of by saying I loved it to death and thought it was the perfect ending to a perfect trilogy. I sat up late at night ferociously reading this book because it kept me anticipating what would happen next at the end of every page.<br /><br />I would always say \\"I'm going to put it down at the end of this chapter\\" and never could. Because every chapter had its own tiny cliffhanger that kept me starving for more. While the events of the story were so engaging and unpredictable I found them to flow naturally and progress in a very pure manner without leaving you with too many questions. I love Katniss in every way; to me she is the ideal female heroine the YA genre needed in every-way. She's flawed but still so strong and likeable. I was surprised by the way the love triangle ended but pleased with it. I was really reluctant in starting this trilogy but am so glad I did. It was 100% worth the hype and more.<br /><br />During this book I laughed, almost cried and felt my blood pressure rise a few times lol. The only thing I didn't like about it is that it ended. This is definitely one of my favorite books that I've read this year and this last book made it one of my favorite series. If you haven't read this series yet, I could not recommend it enough.<br /><br />Rating- R- even though it is YA read it has extremely graphic violence but is not something a teenager 13+ hasn't seen in a movie before.<br /><br />Rated-5/5 (couldn't have been anymore perfect)<br /><br />Janiera @ This is From My Heart
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I loved the first book.  I eagerly read the second book and it was good.  I was not happy with the third book in the series.  It seemed the author was taking the charaters in many directions.  The ending seemed like the author was just done and wanted to wrap things up somehow...It left me thinking \\"thats it...okay\\".  Kind of a let down from the first book.

It is an amazing story full of excitement and love.  I am a very shy person and never would have thought of reading an erotica book, however, once you start you just cant stop.  As I said I have read it at least 12 times and I loved the author back when she was just Icy a regular person, now she is a millionaire.  Congratulations Girl, You did it.

B0069JBKHI|5.0|The Withings Baby Monitor is an excellent product, I originally purchased the ibaby, and when i opened the box, i found wires upon wires that needed to be attached to the monitor.  I'm sorry but I'm not connecting a power cord, speaker wires and an ethernet cable all hanging off my crib so i returnd it the following day.  I read a lot of mixed reviews and was skeptical with the Withings monitor that I just purchased.  At first the setup was pretty simple and went along with the instruction manual.  The only problems I found was on the technical side of the house when attaching the monitor to \\"MY\\" wireless network, but with the excellent customer service contacts and mathieu, you shouldn't have any problems.  Just remember when turning monitor off and on, you have to reconnect the monitor to your wireless network, doesn't take long at all.  My wife's family all live abroad and this monitor plays a big part in our lives because of the time zone difference.  We have it set up, and we can hear her parents and mine talking to our daughter or playing her a lullaby with a nightlight all while she's in her playpen or crib, because did i mention it's portable, Bwahhhh...Again, Thank You Withings for an excellent product.<br /><br />Mahalo Nui Loa from Hawaii
1433524619|3.0|I knew better then order on-line. The print is very small, and the pages are thin, making the text hard to read, even at a desk. Not the type of bible I would haul in for a mid-week study. Otherwise there are lots of references and study clues.
B0071XO8RA|3.0|Sorry to all of you 5 stars. I found the book just OK. It was actually kind of depressing so see how life could be in the future. It reminded me of an ant colony where everyone has a specific job with no chance of a choice of careers. There was no type of recreation except running up and down stairs. To me this was a very dark and dreary book and was glad when I finally finished it. I will not be reading anymore from this author!

B004EPZ03Y|4.0|It kept me chuckling throughout and kept my 4 year old's attention so I guess its a pretty swell family flick.
B0050AV5MW|3.0|I bought Series One of the TV Series and loved it, I then bought the book Vol 1-4 which was good until book 3.  I found that book 1 and 2 were good but book 3 the author was starting to get predictable. I also felt that with each book, there was no defined finale. David Eddings does this very well, he has many books in a series, yet each one has a lead up and grand finale. Apart from book 1, all the other books lacked this finish.  Also, book 1 makes the Starks the people you want to see finish on top, however they all randomly get killed off which takes away that support for the Under-dog feeling. I have stopped reading Book 4 and have decided to go onto other books as it has introduced too many new characters and I have lost interest in the series.
B00664AM5C|2.0|Jude Law's profiteering web journalist was actually a pretty clever plot device. Beyond that, Contagion is as crammed with the cliches as one would expect from a disaster movie. The acting is strong, but the predictability was just too much for me.

B006ISJQBM|4.0|Let's face it, the \\"Rum Diary\\" film is no more likely to have mass appeal than the novel version.  The acting and ambiance were spot on. Depp and associates really \\"get\\" Thompson and I quite enjoyed it. My wife fell asleep half way through...
B007V2UGPE|2.0|It's  a great game! Fairly simple. It's not a tower defense like I thought it would be, but that's a good thing because I'm not really a td fan. Works well. Good graphics.
B0064NTZJO|3.0|I wasn't expecting the world with \\"Drive\\" - basically thought it would be an American version of \\"The Transporter\\". They are not the same beyond the very highest level of plot.<br /><br />\\"Drive\\" seems driven to be different through art and style, but ends up delivering unintentional camp. From the opening credits, I was not sure about the faux Eighties motif - it was pointless.  The dialog seemed as though they lost the first 25 pages of script or something - stark beyond utility or art, in my opinion.  The occasional and sudden ultraviolence made me chuckle while my it disgusted my wife.  The lack of backstory of Driver makes his change less impactful.<br /><br />I didn't hate the movie but there are enough holes in every aspect of film making that it is a B movie for sure.

I remember viewing the first fight scene and thinking \\"Oh, so that's what kind of movie this is...\\" and then they totally pulled the whole thing off. I need to rent this again on blu-ray.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|it would be nice if there were more mini games like the scratch game that you could play while u have to wait forever to gather acorns and coins to advance.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Overall this is a good game. There is a lot of variety and it is a good &quot;killing time&quot; game.
B005TQAI6G|3.0|I am a hardcore fan since Baby One More Time back in 1998.  I have loved her since.  The first concert I went to of hers was the Circus.  It was amazing, although I could tell it wasn't really live.  I've seen her Live from Las Vegas and Onyx Hotel tours.  Both were pretty amazing.  I went to the Femme Fatale tour last summer.  My friends and I didn't have great seats so I was hoping for Britney to run around the stage more and do more.  I may as well have just watched this DVD at home.  It seems she did more during the Circus tour.  I'm questioning whether to go to her next show, whenever it may be.  I went to Gaga's concert and she did a heck of a lot more.  I've also seen Adam Lambert on a tiny stage but his presence and voice just rocked the house.  Britney is not all about the voice but she is about dancing.  I don't like that she lip syncs; I'd rather her sing bad and dance her butt off.  At least you know it's live.  Also the \\"what's up Toronto? I love you Toronto!\\" seemed a bit fake; possibly pre-recorded.  Even calling the fan up on stage for Lace and Leather seemed off.  Britney just sat on the prop onstage while her dancers/back up singers did all the work picking.  Maybe it's just me but I would be so embarrassed hiding behind a recording track and lip syncing.  I would walk off the stage with my tail between my legs and I'm surprised Britney didn't.  I didn't give it a 1 star rating because I liked the show, it's just Britney seemed to be in the way or prevented the show from being 5 stars.  I love Britney but I wonder what is going on with her.  Supposedly she had 2 knee surgeries and that may be why she doesn't dance like she used to.  She also had 2 kids.  Madonna has been through a lot.  Heck, Mariah Carey had 2 kids and is still kicking onstage.  Beyonce was pregnant and doing shows.  So was Gwen Stefani.  Something else is going on here because of other performers can still kick butt while pregnant, after pregnant, surgeries, etc... then she can too.  Heck Michael Jackson went through hell and back and his last concert was better than ever!  Oh and he was dancing and it was live.  Britney I hope you fix whatever is wrong and can come back \\"stronger than yesterday\\" :)
B007SYWFRM|5.0|it's. a different. kind of virtual game that keeps evolving. it's never boring. be warned; this game is itvery addictive.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|love it<br />so much fun catch the scrat<br />cant put it down so addicting. better than the games on facebook
B002BWP49C|1.0|this dvd is a complete wreck, i cant see a damn thing on it.. im so upset i wasted my money on such poor quality. i am returning to get my money back. im so disappointed i love amazon but this really pissed me off.
B0002IQAN6|5.0|this is a great sacd.I have the older dts cd as well. you can hear differences. the bass is less boomy and the vocals are clearer.a earlier review said the sacd's came in a regular jewel case, one on top of another. mine was in a double slim line case.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|addicted. I absolutely love this game. at first I thought I wasted money but then I kept playing and became addicted.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Very Very nice. I cannot say anything bad about this watch. I have purchased many watches so far this one being the best for the money.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|Wonderfully written, great reading. The story in the book was very good, I have always loved stories of murder mystery and having them in London just makes them more interesting. Gives you the real doom and gloom of mystery.
B000NY12LO|5.0|Couldn't put it down! Read this shortly after the high school killings in Ohio - had many similarities.... Definitely reccomend it!
0545265355|5.0|Purchased the boxed set.  The price was very competitive with the big box warehouse retailers.  The stories were great.  Truly a study in human behavior and how societal norms guide what we perceive as good and bad.  I would definitely recommend this series.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|love this game! very very fun. but it says it needs an update to see others village and there's no update... ???
B007V2UGPE|3.0|The game is easy to control.  it is also very simple.  I have only been playing for little bit but am wondering if there is any challenge at all.
0375869026|5.0|This is an uplifting and moving children's novel with a gigantic heart.  It should be on the reading list for every student moving from grade school to middle school, as it teaches important lessons about middle-schoolers' obsession with \\"fitting in,\\" how we treat social outcasts, perserverence, courage and the incredible value of kindness and empathy.  Plenty of role models to go around here, including inspiring classmates, the lead character, great teachers and a wonderful head of the school.  If you don't cry at \\"graduation,\\" your heart needs some work.  The writing is modern and catchy, making it an easy read for children and adults.
B007549YM4|5.0|The Divide is a dark emotion packed movie. Not much on sets but heavy on good acting. I thought this movie<br />was much more realistic than allot of other post-apocolyptic movies. No happy ending and no ray of hopeful<br />son shine. A would call it a groups journey into madness. I recommend this to someone who likes a dark edgy<br />story that doesnt mind a sad hopeless ending.
B005OCFHHK|4.0|I had requested the American version when searching for Harry Potter, but received the European version instead.  Overall good experience, just not the version I expected.
B000AARKOO|5.0|This is a great movie.  A good action adventure.  Its also a plus with the extra disc.  I would say its a good buy for any movie collector.
B0063GORYU|4.0|classic game the fun last way longer than the other fancy games. however the control is not very precise. it may be a problem of kindle not the game itself
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I read the book via kindle. I initially had a problem with lending library as I am a prime member. So Amazon customer service accomodated me and gave me the book for free. It was a good book, the movie did a good job replicating the book but as with most cases the book is better.
B005T87QCI|3.0|you will love this game for a month so if you pay a doller for one month of fun ok but I think I made a mistake
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is totally addicting. I played for the first time until I was level 10. You only have to go to Stuff and press options and the Kindle arrow comes up.
B006N0YWGY|5.0|I have a cracking up blast with this game. great clarity with the graphics on the kindle fire. fun game!
B0078N2MTE|4.0|A five-star movie, for me, is a movie I would like to see more than once. This is a four-star, which means it's very good, and I did not waste my time watching it, and would recommend it to anyone else.
B007P3TMW2|4.0|I read the positive and the negative reviews on this forum. I'm never dogmatic in my opinions because everyone is entitled to their own artistic expression or ...a review of others' artistic expressions.<br /><br />All of the actors in this movie gave compelling performances. You know a movie is good when you are so engrossed that you forget you are watching a movie (until the phone rings, etc.). The young man's acting abilities weren't up to the standards of his adult counterparts but he played a convincing performance of a quirky young boy dealing with the tragedy of losing his father underscored by his \\"maybe\\" Asperger's Syndrome.<br /><br />I think that the negative reviews are harsh but we are all bringing our own experiences to the theatre in this case. I have a son about this boy's age and I could relate to many of the things this mom and her son were going through. Based upon my own experiences, I could emotionally connect with these characters which is what a movie is all about - drawing you in so that you feel you are apart of what you are watching.<br /><br />I think it's a good movie and worthy of at least 4 stars.
B005MW68RK|5.0|I LOVE this album and Beth Hart.  Beth can sing anything - but she sings the hell out of the Blues.  Great material, and fantastic guitar work.  I highly recommend this CD
B007V2UGPE|3.0|Takes way to much space on kindle. And its not worth it. So don't get. If you want to get another APP
B006OCM0G0|5.0|this game offers a lot of fun and will keep you coming back to play. you wont regret downloading this game.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I just finished this book and the first two in the triology after about 3 weeks or so. Out of all of them, I thought the first book was the best.  Although there is a ridiculous and I do mean ridiculous amount of murmuring, blushing, gasping, lip biting, hissing, pouting and so on, the first book gets you hooked even with the simplistic adjectives.  That being said, I read the whole triology because, like others, I had to to know how it all ends.<br /><br />I think these books could have been outstanding with a bit more character development and alot more discriptive language!  How often can one murmur in one chapter?  Well, I will tell you, in these books there is an obscene amount of murmuring going on.  It gets to the point of really, really annoying.<br /><br />As far as the sex, that also gets to be a bit much.  It's just the same language over and over, the same scene over and over.<br /><br />I give these books 3 stars because I did enjoy them (as long as I ignored the blushing and murmuring and squirming)and I will say the end from Christian's POV was possibly the best part of this book.  The rest is annoyingly predictible and silly.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Helped pass a few nights of work haha.  Didnt run very well on my Pantech but that was to be expected.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|It interesting and fun.  EASY controls but still gets progressively more challenging.  Not a big fan of microtransactions and it pushed alot for me to spend real money on stupid stuff. 4 stars.
B0052REUW0|1.0|Steven Pinker is, perhaps, one of the most flawed thinkers of recent history, drawing far reaching conclusions from limited examples. Very limited. I'd not recommend his work at any price, but what is the deal with electronic books being offered at such high prices? Publishers in music and books are eejits.
B0012GTZC0|4.0|I love this author, this book is by far one of my favorites of his.  Constant action, great character development, and amazing story-line details.  If anyone is considering reading this Nazi Germany Espionage thriller you should also check out \\"The Diaries\\" by Chuck Driskell. (ebook only)
0876391277|5.0|This is an excellent book for any saxophonist who wants to express themselves on an entirely new level. The book is filled with exercises to further your expressive palette in an easy and comprehensive manner. It also includes a CD that is also very helpful. I have been playing and teaching saxophone for quite a few years and I cannot recommend this book enough to anyone who wants to further their playing.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|play it and find out how much fun u can have do ur best and keep the food going and the
B000NA2BEU|4.0|I love this series, and wish that it would have gone on past 3 seasons! I'm glad to own it so that I can revisit it whenever I want.
1400164990|5.0|If history had been presented in such an understandable, relevant manner in school I might have actually learned something.  I did not expect to like this book but once I started I could not put it down.  Ferguson presents strong arguments for why civilization developed so unevenly backed up by undeniable facts.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|Good an see the man and her I went to see the fish get out old car free user tend one.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app. There are so many translations to choose from and you can have it read the text to you.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|have enjoyed playing a game that I can share with my kids.  like the idea that I can put much or little thought into playing and still have fun.
B007SGM084|1.0|I agree with other comments.  It shouldn't cost as much or more to download books for the Kindle.  One of the reasons I purchased it was the ease and convenience of not packing a lot of different books all the time but your pricing is really making me start to rethink this whole thing. It was cheaper for me to order the 50 trilogy in paperback instead of for the Kindle.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|don't like how you cant go to visit other neighbors during the game. its one thing when neighbors are not included in the game but when you are required to go to neighbors and you cant its fustrating
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I thought Ms. Collins ended the series in the best way. If you're expecting a \\"Happily Ever After\\" ending, maybe you should skip this book. But if you're expecting an ending that stays true to the characters.....read on! I was not disappointed.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I hats having the ads pop up out of no where and when it looks like a good game its hard to get and the controls are hard to handle
0345803485|1.0|I am so glad I read this book on my Kindle for it enabled me to flip quickly by all the disgusting sex which I did not find to be erotic at all.  Curiousity is what got me to read this book in the first place, seeing it #1 on the Best Seller list.  Why is this book called mommy porn, porn is porn,  I am not a prude but can't understand why anyone would consider this book #1.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|fun but a little difficult to drive.  it would be more cool if the hero turned automatically to face the opponent.  other than that it is cool but you can really only play a few levels before you start having to buy things.
1586487981|5.0|Over the last couple of years I have read books by Sachs, Easterly, Collier, Moyo, Yunus and others on economic theories and the world's poor (I'm currently a political science major). All were great in their own right, but each author of those books certainly had a lens he or she was looking through that colors their insights in regards to poverty and its solutions. The great thing about Poor Economics is that the authors do not have a lens, they are not trying to apply an overarching theory to all the worlds poor or looking for a \\"magic bullet.\\" What they do is teach us that each problem the world's poor face, big and small, deserves its own theory, and that this case-by-case strategy is the only way the international community can really help global poverty. Banerjee and Duflo do a great job of this, and because of it I found Poor Economics to be the most informative book on the subject that I have read so far.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|fun and cute.  a little difficult to get the menu bar up from the base of it but if you pull up options the kindle menu is available
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is probably like my 2nd favorite game. It is really fun. My favorite mini game on it is Serpent. Whoever crated it did a really good job.This game is awesome.
B0055SWM08|4.0|fun but I got to the point I was just using hints Lol.  very cool and low key for a relaxing day
0345803485|5.0|I'm not a big reader but I could not put this down!!! I want to re-read all three books again.
0345803485|5.0|I have never read an Erotic novel before. In fact, I have very little time to read, but after hearing the publicity of this book being \\"Mommy Porn\\", it did spark my interest. I read the sample and was really interested to find out more. I bought the book and I couldn't put it down! Sure there are things I didn't like about the book like her constant talk about \\"My inner goddess\\" and always referring to her vagina as her \\"sex\\", but it wasn't something was going to make me toss the book aside.<br /><br />The sex in the book was not as bad as I thought it would be; there are few times when it's a little too graphic (for my taste), but the majority of the time it was not bad at all. Like I said, I have never read an erotic novel before, but I know I don't want to read about some guy's massive girth with protruding veins literally throbbing with desire (lol), that's just too much for me.<br /><br />The characters were not that bad either. Although, I would've like to read more about Christian's past. In the next 2 books you get a little insight in what Christian's life was like before being adopted by the Greys, but I would've like to heard more. In the third book, he briefly talks about his affair with the \\"Bitch troll\\", but it would've been nice to hear more about his other \\"relationships\\", just to get more insight on him.<br /><br />All together, the book is not bad at all or the series, but like with any book it does have its flaws (that I mentioned above). It did have an ending that I really enjoyed (3rd book) and now I just gotta sit back and wait for the movie(s) to see if it/they can live up to the book.
1400052181|1.0|I have never weighed in on a book, figuring that everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but this book is so horrible that I feel compelled to share my point of view. First, as a scientist, with HeLa cells growing in my laboratory, I can confidently say that nobody ever made a cent on these cells. The cost of obtaining the cells covers the suppliers expense of propagating them. There is no profit. In addition, all you ever need is one vial of cells; since HeLa cells grow forever, the expense is a one time deal. The fact that there are so many HeLa cells around is a testament to their aggressive growth characteristics- not huge purchasing. To paint the incorrect picture that somebody is getting rich on HeLa cells while the Lacks family isn't is untruthful. This author should have explicitly corrected this misconception and she didn't. Second, I can not imagine how the portrait of the Lacks family as poorly educated, immoral, hysterical, violent, irrational helps anyone. Knowing more about this family doesn't enrich the world one bit. I think this book hurts the African American community.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|I think this movie was way under rated. I am not sure why there is so much negativity about this movie. I totally enjoyed it at the theater, saw it twice is a matter of fact. The story was great, the action was top notch, the special effects and costumes blew away many past movies in a minute. This movie is one of the best i've seen. Coming from me that means allot, i am a movie buff. I actually grew up in a theater and watching movies over and over is part of what i do. This movie is far better then so much out at the moment. I suggest you watch it and enjoy it. A perfect 10 !
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I've heard mixed reviews from readers of this finale.  Some absolutely loved it while others felt that it didn't allow for a proper conclusion to each character's developed story line.  I can definitely understand where both perspectives would come from.<br /><br />I loved the final book.  I kept finding myself being surprised over and over (especially in the last half of the book).  Some story lines do end without a proper conclusion; however, it's completely appropriate.  The series has evolved from a book about children in an arena fighting to survive, to books about children coming of age, fighting to survive politics, and now to children waging a war and fighting to survive.<br /><br />The books would be far too neat and tidy if the gore of war didn't bleed into the experience.  Character plot lines end abruptly and without conclusion, because, in war, people's lives end abruptly and without conclusion.  Not every character experiences a happy ending.  Some characters don't even have an expressed ending.  Still, Mockingjay is driven to a conclusion, and it does not disappoint.  It sees the characters through to completion, and does so in a way that preserves a reader's desire to continue involvement in the characters' lives.<br /><br />Excellent book.  Excellent conclusion.
B004XISI4A|5.0|As with the first four novels this maintains an excellent style. Can't wait for the last two. The characters continue to grow and the plot thickens with every chapter. the dramatisation of this on television has added to the lure.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The Hunger Games set an excellent stage for Catching Fire.  To enjoy the first book of the series, you have to do what every author, director, or performer asks of an audience:  Suspend your disbelief.  If you can achieve that in The Hunger Games, and immerse yourself in a world where impoverished children are forced to fight to the death, then you have successfully set yourself up for the mind games that occur in Catching Fire.<br /><br />Viewing the book through Katniss's eyes allows the reader to experience the mistrust and betrayal inflicted upon the character.  Multi-natured characters, situations and plot developments create too much suspicion to allow for any stability.  The perspective shifts from a surviving young woman to one who is struggling to become acutely aware of the surroundings in which she finds herself.  It begins to explore the question of who she wants to be, and who she's expected to be in this new-found position of influence.<br /><br />It's an excellent continuation and excitation of a wonderful storyline.
B0050AV5MW|5.0|Fascinating. Well constructed and certainly full of unexpected twists. Refreshing to find an author who is not afraid to kill off characters who you expect to be a major part of the story. can't wait for the final two novels to be written.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I must admit, when there is a movie/book combination, I must watch the movie first to retain any kind of affection for it.  If I read a book first, the movie inevitably falls terribly short for me.  That having been said, this is one instance where I did, in fact, watch the movie first, and it is under that circumstance that I write the review.<br /><br />This was definitely not my favorite book in the series.  I read it over the span of a couple of weeks, and while it was entertaining, it didn't add any critical information that the movie left out.  The book enhanced the experience and the storyline.  It gave nuance, context and internal dialogue to the situations presented, but it was not one of those situations where I read the book and was blown away by how stark the differences were.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend the book to anyone.  The context, nuance and introduction to Katniss as a narrator were enough to warrant the read, especially since I felt definite tone shifts in Catching Fire and Mockingjay.  Still, the book is as many introductions to a series:  Excellent as a piece, but even better as an introduction to the series itself.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|This is an explanation of the catastrophe that has taken place. It uncovers the crooks and gives warnings about misplaced trust and the times.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love using my phone for books.  It's convenient, it's just great. I'm at an appointment, work, travel, I have a minute or longer wait,I pull out my phone and there's my book. Using my phone as my kindle is great because it is so small, no bulk, smaller than a paperback.  In using the Kindle, it takes a minute to coordinate it with the library e books, but, there is a great support group between the library people and kindle people. Purchasing takes a second and<br />transfer of reading material is also fast. This is all done on a phone, how great.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Lots of great games to keep me busy on a long night at work :) Played until my fingers cramped on the first night lol
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved the book and would recommend it to anyone. I just finished the last book of the trilogy. If I was to buy the book again I would have bought the trilogy, instead of each book separately to save a couple of dollars.
B005USZYDU|5.0|This is a different book from John Grisham - unlike all his other books, short and humorous, delightful reading.  I enjoyed it very much, and read it in one sitting.
0385342039|4.0|I have read several of Kinsella's books including her Shopaholic series.  I enjoy reading her novels because of the lighthearted humor and romance.  Moreover, the protagonist usually encounters/overcomes a life altering experience.  This book surely did not disappoint.  Twenties Girl tells the tale of Lara Lington, a young woman who is not content with the current status of her life.  When she least expects it, someone appears and changes her outlook.<br /><br />Early in the book, Lara attends the funeral of Great Aunt Sadie whom she never even knew.  Sadie lived in a nursing home and passed away at the age of 105.  During the funeral, her great aunt appears as a ghost of her younger self and begs Lara to stop the ceremony.  Sadie does not want to be buried without a cherished necklace and harasses Lara into helping her find it.  The search for the necklace leads Lara on an interesting journey that includes mystery, intrigue, betrayal and love.  Throughout the book, Sadie urges Lara to enjoy the moment and not be so serious about her life.  Initially, Lara is annoyed by Sadie but slowly becomes accustomed to and even dependent on her.  Sadie's life story demonstrates the importance of appreciating the time you have with the ones you love.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|There was so much hype about how the movie didn't match up to the book.  Decided to read the book 1st and it's true!  The 1st and 2nd book is much better than the 3rd book.  It could be because I read them all in 2 days but by the time I started to read the 3rd book, I was hoping it would end quickly.
B003YNFAWI|5.0|I wanted to see this based on the actor, but when I finally got around to seeing it, I found it to be a masterpiece. I do not want to spoil it, but this movie touches on everything right and wrong in America, with race relations, religious relations, and touches on much, much more. Do not just see this movie, do not just rent it, but BUY IT!    This was my Facebook review: If there is one movie that I urge all of my friends to see, not only to rent, but to own, it would be this. Please just trust me on this, I do not want to spoil anything, but this is a must-own movie! [...]
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I felt this was the best Stephen King book I have read so far.  Unlike all other books I have read from King this was not so wordy that you lose the main story line.  The story was very interesting and thought provoking especially for someone who wasn't alive during the Kennedy assination.
B006LQQ1GE|4.0|this is a great CD....reminds me of the<br />Police in 1970.....Sting would be proud.I love the song \\"Somebody that I<br /> use to know\\" - It is a breakup song with both sides talking about the other. Very cool.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|This game needs fixing to much glitches in it. I reach to level 31 twice. And it keeps sending me back.<br />Other than the glitches its a nice game I had it on my phone also and I remove it.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Ok....First off. For those of you who don't know how to get out of the game. Simply press the shop Icon and select settings. Once done; an arrow should appear at the bottom of your screen. press it and select the home Icon......Now for the game. I was highly addicted when I first started to play. I like that you don't have to wait forever for every thing you do. and there are things to do to tide over to the next upgrade is available. it reminds me of those facebook apps like farmvil and such. Overall you should get this FREE game. graphics and gameplay are a plus.
B000SM7QUC|5.0|I love love love this album. You can hear the pain and work the Nikki went through in every song. Such powerful songs.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|good for free, although I doubt I would pay more than two dollars for it . can get a bit repetitive
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|great game I would recommend this game to everyone.  it is a fun simulation game to play.  there is a lot to do and it keeps you busy.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it is an ok game it is hard to beet but it is fun I wish it was esay the end
0486284735|5.0|When I started this book, I must say, it was with dragging feet. It was assigned to me for school and I was prepared for a sappy romance story, probably with big words, like most classics. The first half seemed to be living up to my expectations, minus the big words. In fact, it was so simply written that I began to wonder why it was called a classic at all. I know I may be speaking blasphemy according to some people, but all I could think in the beginning was that this was some twaddle about a bunch of giggly girls from the Victorian era! Then the middle came. At just about the exact middle of the book, things got interesting. Tension was rising; emotions were running like a river through rapids, and I was hooked. I suddenly found myself reading more chapters than I was assigned to that week, and of all the books I had to read in a week, that was the first one I picked up. I can't tell you any more specifically what grabbed me for fear of giving too much away, but I will tell you this: it may take awhile to get there, but it's well worth the wait. Once I had finished it I had to go back and read all my favorite parts! Now I, who sneered at Austen at the first, am planning on reading \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" over the summer. Austen, you have me converted!
B00008PW3Q|5.0|I know that, in some ways, this album is kind of jarring.  But inspired genius is seldom safe and sane.  If you don't love this album, you don't love this band. If there is one thing wrong, and it would be the only thing, is that the music misses Christine.  But I also think there is a kind of hidden restraint in the album that pays homage to her.  It is a beautiful and thought-provoking record.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|lots of classic games but the game resets when you update it. my son loves most of the games. good for long car rides.

B00000JY1X|5.0|The audacity of an artist that  thinks they can release a 3 disc set of originals and make it work. Well , work it does. This release is legendary and deservedly so. I made a 'best of' cd of this set and came up with over 30. Songs. In rock/pop history, very few bands have released double albums, let alone a triple set. Even more amazing-in the vinyl era, generally 40 minutes would fit on a disc, so Stephen Merritt pretty much released a 4 album set all at once. Although over ten yrs old, this set still gets heavy playing- which is saying something considering  I have over 5000 CDs.<br />Don't walk, run to get this one.
B007WPM4V4|2.0|I love, love, love Mad Men but this episode was the biggest disappointment ever in their five year history!  I can't believe the producers of this top notch show allowed such an episode go on the air.  I sat there watching it and wondering the whole time...am I really watching Man Men?  Earth to Mad Men....come back please.  Give us what we watch you for...and this isn't it.
B003Y5H5HO|3.0|** Spoilers, SPOILERS** IF You haven't Viewed STOP READING!<br /><br />HUGE Daniel Craig and this is One of The Hottest Directors in Film but IMO this Film was just not up to par with The Book or Swedish Version. Acting was Good as was Directing but I just didn't feel \\"pulled in\\". Lisbeth had a RUTHLESS \\"GUARDIAN\\" and this One was not as Brutal making You Feel even more for Her and Less for Him even Hating Him in the Swedish Version. In this Film He was much more \\"Humanized\\" and Far less of a Sociopath as in Swedish Film. Ending in Original Was Captivating AND Touching and ALL seemed to be explained much more Clearly I felt in Swedish Film. I did like that they kept at least the Swedish Accents and Filming/Scenary were Beautiful as well. ****I would NOT by any means say this was a Bad Film in any manner only that I personally preferred the Swedish Version**** My point is I am NOT \\"BASHING\\" this Film whatsoever. Cheers :)

B007WPM4V4|5.0|In this episode, the character of Ginsberg finally came into his own. He reveals to Peggy that he was born in a concentration camp and that his father is not his father. This gives his character a depth and a realism that the show had been recently lacking. He can be the moral voice of the 1960s on the show as the Don era of the empty suits from suburbia running things comes to an end along with their cheating, racism, macho attitudes and cigarettes.<br /><br />Don and Roger remain the same macho women-haters they have always been in the episode. But they start to pay the price as strong women finally stand up to them. As has been building all season, the influence of drugs and violence on the world of these people is ever growing. Roger has his first acid trip, but I dont think it will be his last. Peggy leaves her inhibitions and deference to men behind as well.<br /><br />At the end of the show, they finally say whats been obvious for a while. Don has lost whatever talent (if any) he had and, like Roger, he is holding on to a position that he no longer deserves. As the show counts down to 1968, I really wonder how many of these characters will survive the changing of the times.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|good game but after a while it stopped  working other wise its a great game love it. gonna try it again
B007PTJOV0|5.0|great game just got it and I'm already addicted. hope the freebee continues and the levels get better. I recommend this game to anyone who likes Mario bros.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|game was awesome at first few days and after not playing it for about 10 hrs a glitch occurred and reset the timers to make it unplayable for like 130 hours.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME DOWNLOADING, it will only disappoint u
B004SUWR2C|4.0|Unlike others, I experienced no gameplay issues with this game.  I had no computer cheating, no rules broken, etc. that other people have described.  The game itself runs excellently and all the rules are followed by both player and computer.<br /><br />That aside, the UI is awful.  It looks nice, but that's about it.  It is unresponsive, fidgetty, and often bugs out.  Selecting something from the menu is a hassle because you have to time taps absolutely perfectly or nothing happens.  The help menu scrolls stupidly fast, and if you accidentally scroll the text down too far it is lost.  Your cards in your hand often flip out between zoomed in and out.<br /><br />The game itself is great.  The UI needs a lot of work.  4 stars for playing like Uno, and overall being a great app.  Everything about the app is excellent until you have to deal with the UI.  It's not really a big deal once you're playing but getting to that point is a lot more work than it should be.
B004MC8CA2|3.0|the only problem is u cant do it without internet and you have to make an account just to write down notes and things like that
B006OB3K56|3.0|This film is visually good, many scenes in Manhattan, especially those shot outside, in the streets and subway, are very powerful and charged with emotion because of masterful use of color and scenery. On the other hand, sexual scenes are dull and somewhat boring (maybe this is intentional, I'm not sure).<br /><br />Sometimes, though, visual effects are overdone, as in the scene of Sissy's suicide attempt: all this bright red blood on bright white walls and floor looks artificial, shown just to make strong impression on the viewer.<br /><br />Otherwise this is a rather average movie, the plot isn't too convincing, Brandon's \\"sexual addiction\\" doesn't seem to be getting that much in the way of his life, and his failure to help his sister should be attributed more to his general callousness; to be fair, her situation requires more support and effort than an average person can easily provide.<br /><br />The Fassbender's performance in this film I find rather wooden (maybe this is intentional too though). I liked Carey Mulligan very much in An Education, but in this movie I don't find her as good. I attribute this mostly to the character she plays, which is not developed enough to be convincing. The best performed role, to my taste, is that played by Mari-Ange Ramirez. Yes, it's a secondary role, one episode, really, but somehow her play is very convincing and appealing.<br /><br />I'd like to repeat: McQueen, to my perception, failed to show (or I failed to see) convincingly Brandon's sex addiction. Prostitutes? Pornography? Masturbation? Homoerotic acts? But, sorry for asking, is there anybody left who's not doing this, and that, and that - full time including his time in the [Oval] office? Senators, governors, any and every public figure is involved in adultery, exhibitionism, just name it. President's security detail - being on duty - are involved in prostitution scandal in Colombia.<br /><br />So why is an average guy supposed to be any different? Why Brandon's \\"addiction\\" is any worse than what's shown in Sex and the City, or the Babysitters - I fail to understand. The media is so saturated with sexually suggestive imagery that Brandon's lifestyle looks fairly innocent.<br /><br />All in all, this movie is rather average. I watched it to the very end though - meaning it's not that bad.<br /><br />One last note: being a Steve McQueen The Second, maybe you could pick some nice nom de plume.diction\\" is any worse than what's shown in Sex and the City, or the Babysitters - I fail to understand.

B007MJSQSK|2.0|This had a good review by Roger Ebert, so I was optomistic.  The animation is very well done, production is good, pacing is good, but it just didn't engage me.

B000BKDOB6|5.0|I did not come across this album until several years after it had been released and was thrilled to find it. The remastered version of the \\"Horses\\" album was a pleasure in itself, but the true gem here is the live 2005 Lonodon concert at which Smith and her band performed that magnificent 1975 work in its entirety. The sound engineering here is superlative, especially for a live performance - the sound is crisp and clear; there are only a few points at which the mix is a bit off. I find these performances astounding, perhaps definitive. I've never heard a more compelling rendition of \\"Gloria.\\" The band is tight, Smith's articulation and phrasing, joined to driving energy make this perfromance unforgettable. Likewise, the haunting poetic dimension of \\"Birdland\\" really comes through, and the frenetic force behind \\"Free Money\\" makes this rendition very compelling. \\"Land\\" is unsurprisingly, a tour de force. I find nothing self-indulgent in the live disc, as another reviewer complained. This concert performance of a ground-breaking album is a testament to Smith's talents as an artist and performer of enduring significance.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|Got the movie for my ex and her son (it's her favorite movie, he loves it and quotes it a lot too).  She used to rent it from Red Box every 2-3 weeks, probably spent more money renting it than she would've on just buying it.  If you like all the Pixar movies, you'll probably love this one.<br /><br />I love the little evil mad scientist man forced to endure the horrors of children being cute/sweet to him.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|like most of these games u can play for free but buying coins and acorns speedsthings along.  not as expensive as tiny village or tiny monsters but<br />u must log in via facebook or some other social network to complete at least one quest. the game wants very much for u to get ur friends playing.
B001AEF6D6|5.0|While not for everyone, Big Lebowski is amazing and worth quoting randomly with friends for years.  The actors are good, music is great, and the plot is... about a soiled rug more or less.<br /><br />The first time I saw the movie was years ago and my reaction was: \\"What.... was that?  That was a movie about almost nothing!\\"  And I've always enjoyed rewatching it with friends since.  I ordered a copy of the movie for me and one to give a friend for Christmas as well, he'd never seen it and loved it.
0439023513|3.0|As much as I love the Hunger Games and Catching Fire, Mockingjay left me wanting something better than the end. I know it's hard to live up to the previous books and authors tend to lose motivation as the series goes on, but this disappointed me. You can live your life without reading this book. I do have to say the plot was twisty, and sometimes confusing and it isn't the worst book out there, just not what you'd think it'd be.<br />Well...Happy Hunger Games and may the odds be ever in your favor.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|i like so many love playing the game but there is still a glitch that resets all the timers .
1585104205|5.0|Folks, you can stop your search for a Latin textbook.  This is one that really, really works.  A true work of genius.  Honestly, I wish that teachers of modern languages could use this guy's method.  Arabic, for example, sorely needs a Hans Orberg-style textbook writer to remove all the accumulation of grammatical trappings and put them where they belong:  at the end.  Master each chapter completely before moving forward.  And I mean master.  Memorize all the vocabulary, and then re-read each chapter 3 times.  You will then be well on your way to sight reading.  You also need to get the supplemental reader Colloquia Personarum, AND Luigi Miraglia's Fabulae Syrae.  Both of these readers complement Familia Romana and reinforce it.  (Miraglia's Fabulae Syrae is a great condensation of Ovid's stories, and his Latin style is beautiful).  If you are diligent and work hard, you will learn Latin to a degree you never thought possible.  By the end of the book, for example, you are already being exposed to Catullus.<br /><br />However, the first time user does need some guidance on how best to use this book.  There are a lot of supplemental materials offered from Focus Publishing, a publisher which distributes the Lingua Latina series in the US.  They are very nice people, by the way.  Some of these books you need, some you do not.  I got the exercise workbooks, but never used them.  They may work for some people, but I found them not necessary.  So, I am going to go against the conventional wisdom here and say that Exercitia Latina I and II are optional, not mandatory.  BUT this statement comes with a BIG caveat.  Instead of doing the exercise books, you need to READ and RE-READ (aloud at least once) each chapter.  Only in this way will the constructions sink into your head.<br /><br />You want to learn Latin to read Latin, and the more reading the better.  Doing the \\"pensum\\" exercises at the end of each chapter is also optional, in my view (However, you should read thoroughly and digest the grammar explanations at the end of each chapter.  These are models of concision and clarity, even though written entirely in Latin).  Do not get too hung up on inflectional endings and grammar.  This is important!  This has been the punji trap of many a Latin student.  Latin is a language, not a cipher.  Yes, you need to know the grammar, of course.  Native speakers of Latin (other than rhetoricians) never got overly obsessive on inflectional endings, and neither should you.  This will only slow you down.  Far more important is to be able to sight read each chapter fluently.  We are dealing with a language like any other, not a parlor-game cryptogram.  Such an approach does injustice to the language and will inhibit your growth.<br /><br />You should also buy the audio CD Rom for this book, which can be installed on your computer and you can hear the author read the texts aloud.  This is critical to developing your command of the language.  To do this, you have to re-read each chapter multiple times.  Tedious? Yes.  But learning a language, any language, is not for wimps.  So deal with it.  This is a serious project, and if you are would rather fool around, then don't get this book.<br /><br />You should also buy the book \\"Lingua Latina:  A College Companion\\".  Once you have read a lesson the first time, then read the explanations here.  Do NOT read it until you have worked through the lesson first.  This book explains (in English) the grammar that you need to know to progress.  You do need some clear explanations of grammar to fully comprehend what is being thrown at you.<br /><br />You should also get the vocabulary booklet that accompanies this book.  You are going to forget words, and you need to be able to look them up quickly.  When you work though a lesson, write down ALL the words you don't know in a portable notebook and refer to it during the day even when you are not studying.  Then they'll sink in.  You will look like a geek, but who cares.  This is the level of commitment you need.<br /><br />I am now well into part II of this series, which is Roma Aeterna.  Unlike the first volume, Familia Romana, it's more of a reader, and very challenging.  Lots of new vocabulary thrown at you.  But that's what you need!  But I never imagined I'd be able to read Virgil and Ovid after only one year of study.  And it can be done, if you are disciplined and use the right methods.  Be prepared to work on Latin every day for at least 30 minutes with this series for at least 2 years.  If you are dedicated, you can experience the true joy of being connected to the whole of European history.  So, get this book and get cracking.<br /><br />So, in sum, let me be clear about this.  If you really want to learn Latin, use this book and the others in the Lingua Latina series.  If you would rather fool around, look elsewhere.

0143120530|4.0|Think Twice about Upgrading that Iphone ©<br /><br />Born in Washington D.C. in 1982 and brought up by a public relations firm and a think- tank president, it was only natural for Joshua Foer to pursue new ideas as a journalist.  After graduating from Yale, Joshua Foer was published in National Geographic, The New York Times, and other publications.  The story that inspired his first book, Moonwalking with Einstein began accidently while writing a report on the Hall of Fame for weight-lifters. It made him wonder if there was a Hall of Fame for intelligence.  The closest Hall of Fame for intelligence Foer could find was the Memory Championships. A quote by one memory champion, Ben Pridmore, stating that anyone can maximize their memory inspired Joshua to personally experience maximizing his memory and report about it in Moonwalking with Einstein.  In writing his book, Foer is successful in connecting to the reader by not only reporting critical events and technical explanations but by narrating them in a personal relatable fashion.  His composition and style is fairly casual and simple making his book an easy read about a potentially dry topic.  However, at some points, Foer deducts from the topic of memory by expanding too much on his personal life rather than the science and actual techniques that influenced him.  Overall, Moonwalking with Einstein is a 4 star read for its reliability and intriguing topic of maximizing memory, even though more scientific and technical explanations should have been expanded.<br />  Moonwalking with Einstein begins with Joshua Foer's curiosity for the Memory Championship influencing him to ask his boss if he could cover the championship as his next assignment.  After persuading his boss to let him report on the 2005 Memory Championships for Slate, Foer began by interviewing the source of his inspiration, Ben Pridmore.  This led him to meet a more influential memory champion Ed Cooke who explained that with a year's training Foer could be the next memory champion. Intrigued, Foer agreed to take up Cooke's offer.  The introduction to Foer's official training to maximize his memory began with Cooke's explanation of a basic mnemonic memory technique called the \\"Memory Palace.\\"<br />Before starting his training, however, Cooke wanted Foer to learn about the importance of memory in the past.  Through Cooke, Foer learned that memory used to be crucial in ancient times where everything was stored in the mind and not on paper.  Cooke explained that when writing was finally founded, it first was created as a memory aid, but over the years it began to take over memory's place lowering its importance.  Cooke continued explaining that memory shapes people by passing on human values, virtues, character, behavior, and culture.  Foer learns that all new ideas come from new dendrite connections within the web of neurons inside the brain. Cooke defines this act as internalizing new external material.  After understanding the importance of memory, Cooke explained that the next step was for Foer to understand memory through scientific empirical tests, the evolution of the human mind, and by pushing his memory's ability with the new knowledge.<br />Following Cooke's advice, Foer studied the extremes of memory with corresponding empirical data.  He started with the extreme of memory retention in a man called S who had the ability to memorize anything and never forget it due to a disorder of overlapping senses called Synesthesia.  According to S, every word and number had an associated image and feeling which made everything stick in his mind in an organized linear manner.  From S, Foer learned the power of senses in memorizing.  To maximize his memory, Foer knew he had to start creating his own linear sense machine like S's.  To continue learning about extreme memorizers, Foer went to The Human Performance Lab where Ericsson, a psychology professor, tested memories of experts.  According to Ericsson's research, experts had expanded long-term memories associated with their field which novices lacked.  Here, Foer offered himself as a non-experienced participant in the process of memory training.  From Ericsson, Foer became familiar with empirical evidence that grouping and adding meaning to words was key in memorization.<br />After learning about the best memories, Foer met with individuals with amnesia to study memory deficiencies.  Here, Foer learned that memories always corresponded to time in relation to other memories.  Scientific evidence revealed to Foer that the hippocampus and medial temporal lobes of the brain are crucial in memory; the hippocampus transfers short term memories into long term ones stored in the neocortex.  He also learned that conscious declarative memories had to have a known place and time.<br />Finally after meeting with the extremes, Foer learned about the specific evolution of the brain and memory.  Cooke explained that understanding how the mind evolved can guide Foer.  He began with an explanation about ancestral essential memories with links to survival.  According to Cooke's research, our ancestral survival depended on remembering locations and images which is why the technique of the \\"Memory Palace\\" was so effective.  From this moment on, Foer began formally learning and practicing the Memory Palace tricks for the Memory Championship by changing everything from random words to numbers, to elaborate images with specific locations.  He improved his memory by sensing each image completely and shutting out external distractions.  Then, during the final months of training, Foer experienced an improving barrier called the \\"OK Plateau.  Foer successfully overcame this moment by refocusing his goals, staying determined, and trying to beat his old memorization record times.<br />Right before the Championships, Foer met with two savants, individuals who are partially psychologically disabled but extremely gifted in memory, Kim Peek and Daniel Tammet.He found out that the commonality in savants was that they had extreme abilities in their right hemisphere (spatial and image) which supported that memories work best with images associated with locations.  With suspicion that Tammet was just an extreme mnemonist, Foer wondered whether we could all be rainmen with the ability to memorize everything.<br />When the Memory Championships finally came, Foer was ready to compete.  He made it through all the rounds and became the final U.S. Champion after just one year of training.  His progress was retested by Ericsson at the Human Performance Lab where his ability to memorize did improve with training.  Foer ends the book with his realizations from his entire journey.  After the whole experience, Foer realized that memory should be deliberatively nourished and continually maintained, because it is what keeps life memorable.<br />From a reader's view, Moonwalking with Einstein is an easy and interesting read for a broad audience due to Foer's casual style and production of multiple attractions for audiences.  Since Foer writes about his own experience and connections with his parents, job, feeling, and new friends throughout the book, he entertains readers even if they are not interested in the real topic of memory.  For instance, he takes a lot of time to explain small insignificant yet entertaining events such as the specificity of Ed's parents, party planning, and celebrating.  These expanded ordinary events allow for the reader to connect to similar discussions and events that occur in a typical person's life making the story more relative for most readers.  However, for readers who are more interested in the science behind the story, this can be a little frustrating, because it distracts from the main attraction of memory.  This issue is expanded, because there are only a few technically scientific explanations provided by Foer regarding memory.  In the few points in the book that Joshua Foer's actually acknowledgesthe science behind memory, he either shallowly defines activities such as neural activity with associated sections of the brain or streams a lot of information without any definition of terms.  The streaming issue can be seen when he simply reports about the amnesia patient S's condition and then states psychological events without much scientific explanation.  This lack of scientific description concerning memory clashes with how well he describes his personal life throughout the book.  Thus, Foer's imbalance to specifics between personal occurrences and scientific findings divide up his audience favoring less scientific readers.  Another audience made up of the individuals who want to learn the secrets to maximizing memory is also attracted to this book. However, if the tricks are the motive behind reading the book, a reader may be partially peeved if he or she is not patient.  It isn't until one third of the book that Foer actually begins to explain the Memory Palace trick which initially catches readers' attention within the first chapter. However in this case, Foer explains the Memory Palace very well with an activity for the readers to try and learn the technique themselves which is very interesting.  One issue with this is that even though he does a thorough job explaining this trick, his explanation of the number and card tricks are not as thorough and therefore less successful.<br />Overall, even though it is not as scientific and in depth as some would like, Joshua Foer's Moonwalking with Einstein is a very relatable read for many audiences due to its focus on personal events, simple explanations for complex topics and interactive Memory Palace trick,.  Due to the fact that it explains the importance of memory and how understanding the brain can help improve our lives during a time when human memory is replaced by handheld technological devices, Moonwalking with Einstein should be considered a 4 star book for its influential ability.
B0061S0A64|3.0|Had it for several days now and I like it ok but I think I could like it a bunch more if there was a user guide available to show you how to get the most out of it.

0345803485|3.0|The headline sums up my opinion.<br /><br />Now, as to the question of why FIFTY SHADES and its offspring have broken out of the erotic romance genre:  pure sexual fantasy.<br /><br />Begin with the characters.  Beauty reigns supreme, especially the Adonis that is Christian Grey, who is perfect in every physical way, but who suffers obvious psychological problems.  The heroine disparages her looks; however, we know she's a beauty as reflected in Christian's demanding grey eyes.<br /><br />Everybody's wealthy, though none approach Christian, who commands a telecommunications empire and all the benefits therewith.  Who wouldn't want to cruise around in expensive cars, hop off to local spots in a helicopter or more distant locations in a jet, or be chauffeured?  The exception to wealth, of course, is heroine Anastasia.  No doubt, though, she will be, as soon as she straightens out Christian.<br /><br />Then there's the lovemaking.  The old 80-20 rule applies here:  80% foreplay entirely directed at Anastasia and 20% intercourse.  And can the guy go at it:  he cannot satiate himself and can go multiple times in succession.  Naturally, he's blessed with supernatural potency, but a reader certainly would like to project herself into the Anastasia role as one who can make a man as virile as a Greek god.<br /><br />As for the sadism, which is mild stuff, well, a girl must have a challenge, as in making him normal.<br /><br />Finally, you might think Christian is in control.  You'd be wrong.  Anastasia and her inner goddess control Christian, who breaks each of his whacky rules one after the other for her.<br /><br />Money, mind-blowing sex, and control:  the trifecta of female imagination.<br /><br />Three stars for no other reason than the author brilliantly tapped into the mother lode of female desire, and even got film control for what no doubt will be a blockbuster along the lines of the Twilight series.

I can't do the running portion or the jumping jacks yet due to my foot not being completely healed, but it was effective, fun and I found Jillian the personal coach different (in a good way)than what I had percieved.  I plan on trying more of here DVDs.
B005EGXTEE|5.0|Best series I've read in 3 years. Couldn't put my Kindle down! So much food for thought so many questions as you read. Ask yourself, would you survive if this was your future? How much of the world's population would make it through? Broaden your horizons and read it!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|not quite what I was expecting but fun. I do wish you could do more stuff without paying actual money.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is awesome! I decided I wanted to read the book before I go see the movie, and I'm so glad I did. I have my own imagination of the story which I can definitely say the book is so much better. If I hadn't read it, I wouldn't have known what the Hungar Games were about. I recommend even if you have seen the movie, do read the book. You won't regret it!
B002MQYOFW|1.0|Heard the book was better than the movie---I couldn't put any of the books down...read the whole series in 2 weeks
B007MNV5WU|2.0|only two worlds? I bought this at 1 pm and won every level before the evening news. Disappointing to say the least
B003OF3R0S|5.0|This Band never disappoints us and the Album Rocks, I wish Jimmy were here to have seen it through.  Thanks for pushing on!
B000FCKGPC|4.0|another great book just wish he did not kill off so many good characters.. the mysterious of who is doing what to whom, is great..
B004EPZ03Y|1.0|The bluray disc never worked. I would return it if i felt I had a chance of having it remedied.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Downloaded the book to my Android phone to read while on vacation to Nepal. Fun reading, and the book content was complete and easy to read.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|pretty awesome app would recommend it if you're bored and looking for fun. great graphics and game play<br />play it!!!
0345803485|1.0|Dud. Finished 50 Shades of Gray and well, it's as far from BDSM erotica as a Harlequin Romance is from serious literature. Many of my literary friends have asked me to categorize it and the best I have been able to come up with is that it a mediocre romance tied into a pseudo-BDSM theme. Anyone familiar with true BDSM literature will find this book utterly pathetic and even as a romance, it's only so-so. The deflowering scene is unbelievable in the heroine's reaction and after that plus the minute few exposures she has to Christian's \\"Dark Side\\" she freaks and leaves over the tamest thing he could have done (BDSM-wise, that is).<br />Instead of being some new BDSM novel, it's looking more like a Redemption Romance where the heroine saves the hero by being a source of light/change. Nice but not all in the BDSM life are 'dark' and I cannot believe that someone who has a playroom like Christian's is going to just do a 180 for such an insipid heroine like Ana.<br />I'm halfway through 50 Shades Darker and it's getting sappier. Hardly, the \\"naughty novel\\" hyped by the news media. It's Harlequin Romance does bondage. :(<br /><br />Anyone who finds the sex 'hot' in these stories has obviously never read bondage erotica.  Try A.N. Roquelare's (nom de plume of Anne Rice) Sleeping Beauty Trilogy. It is far better than this tripe.
0345803485|1.0|Gack! Bad writing. Bad plot. Stupid, simpering characters. I cancelled my pre-order for book 2.  To write any more would simply waste even more of my time than I already have.
B007MJKOY4|3.0|I tried, I really tried to like this film, even watching it a second time with the subtitles, but the slow pace was just dialed down a little too much for my taste. Well crafted, well acted, but the dial just needed to turned up a notch or two.
B004X75RCW|5.0|I don't particularly care for the male lead actor, but only because he started off in \\"Waiting\\" and that's the only role I can visualize him playing.  Obviously, he is doing quite well for himself these days, given the movies he is now doing.<br /><br />Good movie, worth the purchase.
B007MLDC2I|5.0|Dubbed beats subtitles by a bunch!  What a great movie!  Much better than the recent US version.  Not for the squeemish, however.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love how the animals match the characters of the movie. The mini game is neat! The size of the map is great and the scenary is cool.
1469984202|5.0|One of the best books I have read in a long time.  The universe is fascinating and the story will keep you guessing throughout the entire book.
B00729GQ0A|5.0|Forever Girl is a fun, engaging read with an interesting supernatural storyline. The writing is top-notch and flows so easily that I had a difficult time putting it down at bedtime. When morning came, it was my date for breakfast. There were some scenes that took place during the time of the witch hunts and the writing was utterly superb when describing the past.<br /><br />Ms. Hamilton created a sympathetic protagonist that I easily identified with. At times, Sophia is enigmatic, shy, or hesitant, like a real person would be. Many times, I felt like crying for her. The situation with her mother was heartbreaking. When she needs her mother the most and could use advice and understanding, her mother's zealotry and concern for appearances stops her from helping her daughter. Sophia is like a chair in a ballroom that is easily pushed to the edges of the room, where her mother is concerned. Unfortunately, I have seen this situation in real life and Ms. Hamilton described it perfectly.<br /><br />It was refreshing to have a Wiccan main character. I would have liked more information about the religion and the significance of the particular herbs used and why Sophia chose them. I also spent some time wondering about the minutiae of Sophia's life and wanted to know a bit more about her. Trivial things.<br /><br />Sophia behaved like a thoughtful and prudent young lady when it came to her romance with Charles. Many times, authors take advantage of the term \\"witch\\" and rely on ignorant and outdated notions and stereotypes. Not so here! I was very glad to see a witch I could relate to and respect as a person.<br /><br />My only regret about Forever Girl is that I wasn't able to resist the temptation to read it at once, after downloading it. For surely, this is the type of book I could curl up in bed with during a stormy weekend.
B007NYODBS|4.0|I enjoyed this movie very much. How refreshing to watch a movie meant for adults and that does not stoop to the lowest common denominator. No dying spouses or  dying animals, just wonderful acting and an amazing script.  I wish more movies like this would be made, but in the age of Nicholas Sparks and Terminator I don't  think that will happen.
B003EV6DBW|5.0|This series just takes my breath away.  On top of what is just becoming the best Doctor ever, the HD video quality is excellent.  This is a keeper.
0307454568|5.0|So well written that you feel as if you are part of the action. Impossible to let the book go until you are done reading it.
B003Y5HWJU|5.0|As I do not have HBO on cable TV, I was thrilled to be able to purchase the first season of Boardwalk Empire and will purchase the succeeding seasons as well.  Steve Buscemi was MADE for this part and he was absolutely fabulous!  This is not to take away from the rest of the cast.  Thank you!
B003G4W49C|5.0|Orson Scott Card's \\"Ender's Game\\" is one of the defining books of science fiction.  It's well-written, intense, and both intellectually and emotionally satisfying to read.  I've read it at least half a dozen times over the last several decades and I still find it to be a wonderful book.  I highly recommend it and rate it at an Excellent 5 stars out of 5.
B00466HN72|5.0|If you like children's/animated videos you'll love this!  A great mix of live person and animation.  Good story line without being overly dramatic.  Fills in those gaps that children (and adults) have been wondering about the Easter Bunny.  Colorful, action filled.  Really a fantastic movie!
B00536OCZA|5.0|If you need to read a review about this album, you have major issues. I can't add anything about the content of this album. This review is about the 2011 remaster on vinyl and if it's worth it. The reasoning to investigate is since it was an analog recording, it should be heard on analog equipment. The album arrived in Amazon's cardboard packaging, minimal but effective. I eagerly unwrapped it, and was thrilled to see the 180 gram vinyl was in a static resistant sleeve to resist pops and scratches, a big plus. The new poster is nice and the code for the digital download was included, but the obvious reason for all this was the vinyl. I put the record on, and have to say the sound is just unbelievable. The heartbeats in the beginning are clearer, deeper to where I could feel it. After the crescendo to where the band dives in to Breathe, it's like a sonic curtain coming off a masterpiece. Unlike many remasters where they generally just sound louder, Dark Side is cleaner and has a warmth that simply has to be heard to be believed. This may sound cliche, but seriously, this is like hearing the album for the first time all over again. If there was ever a reason to buy a turntable, this version of Dark Side would be it. An absolute must!!!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|A real page turner had a hard time putting it down. Although the ending wasn't what I expected It still was very good. I wished it was longer.
1455803197|4.0|Not quite in the top tier of audio books, but done very well; well enough to be engaging on a long road trip, at 4am...<br /><br />  The two main characters are portrayed as being 12 & 14.  Having worked extensively with that age group, those ages simply not believable given the diaglog the author puts in their mouths.  Other than that disconnect it's a fun, lively and light hearted story that pulls you in and bounces around on (and off ;-) the edges of credulity.
B0079R8IYW|4.0|I've had my Fire since first day of release, but I've held off on getting a case for it. Frankly I haven't liked the price points, with cases costing almost 25% the price of the Fire itself.<br /><br />Therefore, I jumped at the chance to preview this case, and I'm not disappointed. The Kindle Fire fits perfectly within the slip-in enclosure ... not too snug nor too loose. The enclosure has a back flap to tuck in around the Fire to keep it from slipping out.<br /><br />The edges of the enclosure area are cut out perfectly to match the areas of the top and bottom of your Fire which you need access to.<br /><br />The top flap of the case acts as a pocket for papers, money, or possibly storing a microfiber cloth. It also has four card slots in which you could carry credit cards or business cards.<br /><br />The back folds over and slips into a tab on the back of the cover to stand it up in landscape mode. I found this arrangement to fit and work well.<br /><br />While the \\"synthetic leather\\" is soft and looks durable, it certainly isn't as plush feeling as real leather covers. However, it seems well made and I think will bear up unless abused. The stitching around the edges is even and tight.<br /><br />The supposed magnets to keep the cover closed don't work well as far as I'm concerned. If I hold the Fire face down, it falls open easily. You can get it to stay closed in that situation if you carefully align the cover so the corners match exactly after you close it, but I'm not going to do anything like that every time I close this cover.<br /><br />This case looks to be a good value, and will serve well to protect the device and its screen. I recommend it.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|I got this app for my son. Very dissapointed because it allows the player to buy coins which automatically are charged to your amazon account. I
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Very Very well written story. Highly engaging! I couldn't put it down, and the differences between each short story is what makes this series Amazing!
B006X08FDA|5.0|I totally love this cd! My preference is folk, bluegrass, a little acoustic blues never hurts, and these guys have it all. Good vocals, innovative banjo and definitely unique percussion. The only thing I hate is that it took me so long to learn about this band - will always appreciate Amazon for sending me those incessant sales pitches, because this album was one of them. I'm downloading more!
0316098337|3.0|Because the first half of ROOM by Emma Donoghue is both maddening and irritating, I would not have read the much better second half if I had not felt guilty about it. I won the book from butterybooks.com and would have felt bad about abandoning it because I know many other people wanted to win that book.<br /><br />The story begins with a mother and her son imprisoned in the backyard shed of a madman. The child is 5 years old and has never known anything outside that one small room. That, for me, was maddening and difficult to read.<br /><br />Irritating, though, is the constant baby talk. Constant because the story is narrated by the 5-year-old.Everything the boy says in the first half of the book made me sad as well as irritated. But in the second half of the book, I often enjoyed his view because it's laugh-out-loud funny.<br /><br />Although I appreciated the child's perspective, again, the constant baby talk irritated me. The book loses points for that reason.
B0071DJZZA|4.0|Love the book.  Very exciting!  The story is well written.  Can't wait to read the next 2 in the series!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|this book is great..soo well written..it is very salacious..but..at the same time is in good taste..I have purchased all three trilogies..and am on # 2 I don't normally read fiction but..there was soo much fanfare about the book before it was available to purchase it piqued my interest..soo I went the \\"kindle\\" route with Amazon..and \\"jumped the gun\\"
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Fun to play. Somewhat addictive. It's like a cross between Sims and the original Oregon trail. Overall it's entertaining. I'll keep playing.
0679805273|5.0|This book arrived super fast and in great condition.  I purchased this book as a gift for my son to give to him at his High School graduation...in 13 years.  He started Montessori school last year as a 2 year old.  That teacher is retiring and this week I will have her and his teacher from this year sign the book.  I will have every teacher through H.S. sign the book for him and I will give it to him for graduation.  I want this to be a surprise, but it would be nice if he had memories of us reading this book to him as well, so I am trying to figure out how to do that.  I might have to check it out of the library for reading...hmmmm.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This series was terrific- and I actually enjoyed books two and three almost as much or even more than the first one- once you got used to the writing and story line, it was great to actually have a bit more of a plot to follow.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I love the game until like all customer that got this game had the same problem. it glitches after lvl 15 if they fix that glitches then the game would be great. until then only 1 star and removing it from kindle.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved it- read it in about 24 hours...now all of my friends are reading it...they say they are making a movie of this (but I am not sure how they could do it justice and be true to the story) but worth reading- really enjoyed this series- and glad I have my Kindle Fire so I could download Part 2 and 3 straight away.... yeah for instant gratification!
B003VANOFY|3.0|This is one of my favorite products. I've had two sets, however, and after beween 6 monts and 1 year, they sort of 'die'. I had replacement batteries sent, that helped for a while, but just not the same.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|if you are looking for a game where you build your city and town at first glimpse this looks like a game called smurf village (a game my sister likes to play but when you start playing it it becomes slightly more complicated unfortunately I think the energy runs out too fast this is a must get for all ages.
B006JXW2BC|3.0|Maybe I got my expectations up too high after reading reviews from both  the industry critics and the rest of us, but this album has left me feeling a bit sort of, well, no different to how I was before I'd heard it.<br /><br />A long time fan, I too love the raw, primal energy that Sinead O'Connor imbues into all her work. Whether it be her claustrophobic breathy whispering, or piercing pitch perfect angst/despair/rage, her voice has the ability to jettison you completely out of whoever or whatever else you are, and land you slap bang on your knees at the feet of her world.<br /><br />Melodically speaking this album is suberb, and the voice; deeper, more controlled and resonating with maturity, is absolutely breath taking.<br /><br />The problem is the lyrics.<br /><br />Her cover of the Queen of Denmark is brilliant though.
B007V2UGPE|3.0|I was playing the game and it was awesome but it crashes a lot :/ so I had to keep uninstalling then installing again and again so I finnaly gave up and just deleted the game so I think that the creators need to find a way where this game doesn't crash or make it more reliable and better
B001POX73C|2.0|I was excited to read this book after reading all of the positive reviews. However, I couldn't even get half way through it. I didn't captivate my attention(in fact I found it rather boring), and I had no desire to continue reading it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think that this game is awesome because there is so many games.  Also you can keep on getting more points.  And now I don't want to type more because there is so much to say.
B006Z7Z3S6|5.0|This movie, like many of Ti West's films, is a slower paced movie, but continues building suspense until the very last scene. I don't mind slower movies at all, assuming it has an intriguing story that keeps my attention, and this definitely does. The story is solid, the ghosts look creepy as hell, and the ending to the film is just straight up intense, which makes it worth every minute. Highly recommend to horror fans.
0345803485|2.0|I'm sad to say that for me the book did not live up to its hype. I understand the entire premise of it, I just... I dunno... it's definitely NOT at all what I was expecting. The minor parallels to the Twilight Saga were incredibly evident, but a bunch of things I had read, and what others had been telling me, was that it's like \\"The Story of O\\" for this generation. Again... no. LoL!<br /><br />I heard what people were saying about it and that's what I was expecting. I certainly was not expecting a sexual fantasy book where the sweet little innocent \\"virgin\\" attempts to usurp the big, bad Dom's power and turn him back to \\"sexual normalcy\\" all because he has emotional trauma from his childhood that has \\"made\\" him this way, with this whole wishful thinking aspect of \\"if I can love him enough and show him he's good enough, then maybe he'll finally learn to love\\".<br /><br />I don't know... I just found that aspect of the story kind of childish and just REALLY ridiculous after hearing all of these WONDERFUL things about this book. I guess I'm just disappointed because this book soooooooooooooooooooooo did not turn out how I was expecting. If I had missed the media circus surrounding these books and had picked them up before the American media got a hold of them, I'm sure I would've enjoyed them because I wouldn't have had any preconceived notions about them.<br /><br />But when you hear it's Twilight fanfic/based on Twilight, I'm expecting a preternatural element of some kind. Did I get that? No. Then I read somewhere, \\"It's 'The Story of O for this' generation\\". Did I get that? No. Instead, what I got was a non-preternatural Twilight inspired romance series with sex that in no way, shape, or form resembled \\"The Story of O\\".<br /><br />I'm sure I would have still been rolling my eyes at a lot of sections, and would still hate the comparisons of Christian and Edward (I loathe Edward... sorry... LoL), but without the media hoopla to lie to me about what it was about, I would've ignored all that and just focused on the story with what was given to me. But I still wouldn't have liked the \\"let's change Christian and make him 'normal'\\" aspect, and I think that was another big problem for me. Certain aspects of his character development worked for me, and were predicable with what HAD to happen to give the series a \\"happily-ever-after\\", but there were a LOT of things that could have been different and still have accomplished the same thing and left some aspects of the \\"old Christian\\" somewhat intact.<br /><br />I've read worse of this genre, but I've read MUCH better. Like I said before, for me personally, it just did not live up to its hype. I hope others had/have a better experience with it! LoL!
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Fascinating person and story.  Very well written. We are all the lucky beneficiaries of his life passion!  I am now an \\"Apple junkie.\\"
B002MQYOFW|3.0|This is an easy read, and mostly interesting, but definitely fantasy. Would recommend for younger readers who enjoy sci-fi, etc.

0143121006|5.0|The mutilated corpse of a foreigner found at the base of Fox Tower on January 8, 1937 posed a special problem for Peking police.  The victim was a free-spirited young woman named Pamela Werner.  When Pamela wasn't attending school in Tientsin, she lived in Peking with her adoptive father, Edward Werner, a scholar and former British consul.  She had been beaten to death and then dumped at Fox Tower.  Multiple wounds were inflicted post-mortem in an apparent attempt to dismember the body.  Sections of her skin and some of her organs had been removed.<br /><br />The task of investigating the crime fell to Han Shih-ching, with the assistance of Detective Chief Inspector Richard Dennis, who headed the police in the British Concession in Tientsin.  Dennis delved into Edward Werner's troubled past, learning of the problems he caused in his various diplomatic postings before he got sacked, a history suggestive of mental instability.  Gossip -- the favorite sport of the expat community -- suggested that death and tragedy were Werner's constant companions, including the suspicious death of his wife.<br /><br />A little more than a third of the narrative has passed by before a promising suspect emerges, but if solving the crime were that easy there would be no story to tell -- at least not a story filled with drama and intrigue.  Fortunately for the reader (less so for Han and Dennis), the British government increased its efforts to impede Dennis' investigation, suggesting that a cover-up, if not a full-blown conspiracy, was afoot.  Brits Behaving Badly becomes a subtext, as does the concept of \\"saving face,\\" a characteristic often associated with Asians but quite applicable to the British living and working in China.  Racial bigotry also played a role in the British government's insistence that the investigation should focus on Chinese rather than foreign residents.<br /><br />The investigation took place as Peking prepared for invasion by the Japanese.  As in any complex investigation, Dennis and Han pursued a number of false leads.  The investigation brought them into contact with foreign residents of Peking who indulged in (to put it delicately) unusual recreational activities, suspicious but not necessarily related to Pamela's murder.<br /><br />A little more than halfway through the narrative, Dennis finally receives information that provides a credible solution to the mystery while pointing to a suspect who is beyond the law's reach.  At that point, however, Peking is virtually under siege by the Japanese and Pamela's disappearance is all but forgotten.  Dennis is recalled to Tientsin, the official investigation is closed, and it falls to Werner to use his own resources to discover the truth about his daughter's death.  He pursues that goal relentlessly over the course of several years.<br /><br />Midnight in Peking reads like a well-paced murder mystery, but it is ultimately a tale of corruption, not just within the Peking police but, more startlingly, within the British government, whose officials valued the façade of British civility more than the truth.  The narrative proceeds at a steady pace and is enlivened by insightful examinations of the principle players.  Paul French provides the reader with enough background facts to add flavor but not so many as to bog down the narrative in needless detail.  The text is well-documented in a series of endnotes.  It seems likely that, for the sake of good story telling, French re-creates some scenes and conversations in greater detail than the historical record allows, but the book suggests no reason to believe that he has plays fast and loose with historical fact.  His attempt to tie the \\"fox spirit\\" into the story -- representing a woman who beguiles and betrays -- is colorful but a bit weak.  Still, Midnight in Peking is a fascinating look at a forgotten moment in a distant land, an unsolved murder that \\"slipped from history\\" despite the compelling evidence of guilt that Werner finally assembled, and that French faithfully reproduces.ally assembled, and that French faithfully reproduces.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I have tried this game and although I really liked it at first it became very boring because there was no way for me to connect to the community people to play.  You need neighbors in the game or you can't advance.  I don't have friends that have a Kindle Fire to play some of these games so I rely on the community.  Just didn't work out for me I guess.  Cute game though if you have neighbors.
B006XIR9KM|5.0|Sounds and music remind me of lumines.  Very fun app.  I'd even pay for it.  Kudos to Retro Dreamer.  Keep it up.
0345803485|5.0|Why all the negative reviews for such a compelling book?  Sure, it's not a literary triumph: the writing and the characters have flaws, the characters are somewhat unrealistic, and the dialogue is totally repetitive to the point of annoyance, BUT...this book is every woman's fantasy (with icing on it)!  I don't really see this as a BDSM book, but more of a heavy romance novel with some erotic and interesting sex scenes built in.  The romance is really what drives the novel...the all-consuming \\"I can't live without you\\" type stuff that most woman never really get to experience in life.<br /><br />This is how I judge how good a book is:  how many days did it take me to read it (two days!  And that's saying something for a how busy I am!)?  How much of a page-turner is it (very much so!)?  Do I care about what happens to the characters and how it ends (YES!)?<br /><br />With all its flaws, this book kicks major butt and deserves all the hype it has been getting.  I sort of classify it as 'fantasy romance' - which is just fine with me.  Books are supposed to take you away into a different world - but still allow you to relate and picture yourself in such an unlikely scenario.  And, would I love to be Ana...lemme tell you!  Does it matter that it's not technically the best constructed novel?  Not to me...but it looks like it does matter to a lot of people!  It's just not the way I value books, I guess.<br /><br />In my head, I compared the character of Ana to the character I read in the Marriage Plot.  Both are pretty, smart yet bland gals graduating college, like their English literature, and have boys pining after them that they don't give the time of day.  The Marriage Plot had an interesting concept, was well-written (technically), but it was an effin' bore.  I didn't care about the lead characters, nor did I give a hoot how it ended.  It took me about 3 weeks to read 1/3 of the book.  Yawn....<br /><br />So...what I am trying to say, is that with all its flaws, thisbook still manages to do what some of the best writers out there fail to do:  suck you in, let you go on a great ride, and satisfy the need to live in an unrealistic world for a while.<br /><br />I am currently reading the second book and it's more of the same juicy (yet flawed) read that the first book is - with some added tidbits.<br /><br />I am curious to see how they are going to bring this book to the big screen - they are either going to have to tone the sex down or give it an NC-17 rating.  Whatever the case, I will be happy to see these characters come to life!

The writing is so good it shames other people who call themselves authors.<br /><br />Last night I turned to a random page and was laughing within thirty seconds. What else can I possibly say. Read this book. You'll see...

B007WBRL48|2.0|We finally get to see Bobby again and he's neutered down to saying his catch phrase. \\"Balls! Balls! Balls!\\" It made no sense either. He spends the whole episode bitching about going through things, not being able to move anything, and at the end, suddenly he looses the ability to go through things and we spend ridiculously tense minutes while he searches the room to find the switch. I'm glad he learned how to move things but really! This could've been an awesome way emphasize being a ghost but they lost that. I was watching it, thinking, go through the freakin' wall, you idiot. That's all you've been doing all episode.
B007JRU2UK|2.0|Not a \\"feel good\\" movie, for sure. The ending isn't worth the agony of watching the rest of the film. If you feel like being depressed, watch this.
0345803485|1.0|I have never read an erotic novel, nor have I read anything about BDSM. I have not researched it at all either to determine the similarities/differences to this book. Obviously, my comments later in this review need to be taken with that in mind.<br /><br />I agree with nearly every negative post on here about the blandness of the characters and writing. I'm halfway through this book and I will attempt to finish it for my book club. But I'm just saddened that this is a best seller. I can see the Twilight references throughout, with Ana's similarities to Bella, and the male character doing whatever they think needs to be done (ie: Christian tracking Ana's phone to find her when she's at a bar with her friends) without a care for the female's opinion.<br /><br />More than all of the bad writing though, I have an issue with the contract set forth between Christian & Ana. Don't get me wrong, I vaguely understand the roles of the dominant/submissive IN THE BEDROOM. I can see this contract being utilized during sexual play and time spent together. But the contract basically makes her a sex slave. And I think that is frightening and disturbing. He controls her ENTIRE life. He dictates where she goes and what she wears and how she lives. And then, after all that, if at any time he wishes to sever the contract he may do so. She however, has to ask permission and he can then choose to grant her permission to sever the contract.<br /><br />So if Ana wakes up one day and decides she no longer likes this lifestyle, she has to ask his permission to leave. And then if he says no...won't she then a victim of kidnapping or rape or something else horrific?<br /><br />I'm alarmed that women find this kind of control of their life something worth fantasizing about.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is the best App on my Kindle Fire! It is very easy to use and I love the plans that are available with this app. I use this on my Kindle in church every Sunday!!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This was not worth reading, couldn't even finish it!  Billed as a Twilight type story, but not even close, poorly written and terrible characters.  Not worth spending money on this book and not worthy of New York Times Best Seller.  When you download the sample it really seems like an ok read.  Once you buy the book you realize it is poorly written, no depth to the characters, and just overall not worth the time to read.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game so much! it is so addictive and fun to play and 100% free! you got to get this game!!!! I love this game so much! I would regimens it to all ages boys, girls, men, and women.

B003Y5HWMW|5.0|... I would do it with this one. From the extra features to the show itself, this was one of the best values I've ever gotten on Blu-Ray. If you read the books, this will help ease your mind for the things that have to either be left out (for brevity) or added in (for explanation), because really it's all there when you dig into the special features. If you are watching with someone who hasn't read the books, you don't have to explain the whole world of the Seven Kingdoms (and beyond) to them ... they can learn as much as they want to from these features.<br /><br />This is one of my top-3-ever fantasy series, and the show has stayed quite true to the book. This season covers roughly the first book (_A Game of Thrones_) plus a couple of chapters, while the 2nd season will cover roughly the 2nd book (_A Clash of Kings_). If you liked the books, if you like fantasy, or if you flat-out just like a good story of intrigue, betrayal, plotting, etc. (with a heavy dose of sexuality), you will love this series.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|This is the first book of this genre that I have ever read and I enjoyed it. As a commuter, it's ideal because you can read it quickly and it's quite exciting from beginning to end. It also nicely develops your anticipation for the sequel. I would recommend it for sure.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|I had the older model that was IR and it was great until you left the room or line of sight was interupted.  But this one's got RF so now I never miss a sound.<br /><br />I lived in a townhouse at the time and shared a wall with a neighbor.  This provided a solution to that while still offering some semblence of surround sound without the wires.<br /><br />But, most importantly - the gaming!  I wanted to hear my games in BOTH ears AND be able to chat with friends.  This changes late night gaming for everyone who may have others in the house that don't want to be disturbed while allowing you to hear which direction bullets are coming from, explosions, DIAGLOG, etc...<br /><br />People have mentioned the underlying wireless buzz, and although I believe that's a caveat of most (if not all) wireless headsets...<br /><br />1) it truly is hardly noticeable during silence (no sound or dialog on screen)<br />2) it's a moot point as soon as there's any sound to play - it's drowned out by anything from soft wind to crickets ;)<br /><br />These headphones are comfortable and with rechargeable AA (2) batteries you'll thank yourself for it almost immediately.<br /><br />NOTE:  I can't say that I find myself fully appreciating the 7.1 surround sound as I do not consider myself an audiophile, but direction and left/right are definitely discernable.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I, too, wanted to see what all the ruckus was about.  I tried very hard to read this book but it was so awful that I gave up about about 25%.  The characters are one dimensional and the dialogue made me cringe.  I can't understand how anything written this badly can be a best seller.  Save your money.
B0063IH60K|2.0|You are annoyed by too many popup adds. Otherwise it is a good game. I would pay if I could get rid of ads.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|One of the best TV series ever produced.  The entire cast including those whose characters have been discontinued are the best matches I have ever seen.  The writing, direction, scene selections, editing, photography, costuming, and pacing are unmatched.  I sincerely hope J. F. will be able to keep this ensemble together for at least one more season.

B0043ISH6O|3.0|As with Ghosts I-IV, Trent and team have generated a lot of throbbing, layered, slightly paranoid and forboding sound effects.  I suspect they fit the movie well (I haven't seen it).<br /><br />Nice mix of paces and sounds, I still don't know how he comes up with some of the synthesized or captured sounds he layers into his music.  It's a continual wonder to me.  This one isn't going to wake you up and kick you in the tail to get you moving...but it is a good listen nonetheless.  I find it good music to concentrate to (e.g. headphones at work), it gives me just a little bit of a diversionary or distracting edge, but not enough to really derail my train of thought unless I choose to let it.
0345803485|5.0|I found this book to be thoroughly entertaining.  Not the best written book out there & not erotica (nor does it claim to be). It's a love story with a lil BDSM! Not a thing wrong with that!!!!! Christian Grey is yummy, albeit a lil unbelievable, but that is why it is called fiction people!!  Have read the whole trilogy and they were a nice escape, as all good books should be.

REALLY????), this was pretty fun. It's not Saving Private Ryan. It's not Black Hawk Down. It's not Alien, Aliens, Predator, Independence Day...for that matter it's not even \\"The Arrival\\". But it's still fun and a great excuse to pound some popcorn and a beer or two. Looks great in full HD on the Blu-Ray version too.<br /><br />Retreat? Heck no!

B006G2NVCA|4.0|The cover of 'Immigrant Song' on this album is fantastic.  Otherwise, a lot of atmospherics (as you'd expect from a movie soundtrack).  I enjoy it, but there's not much on this album that is standing out hugely to me like some of the tracks on Ghosts I - IV (which I'm starting to think was an extended \\"we can do movie soundtracks too!\\" audition. ;-)<br /><br />Long time NIN fans who collect every \\"Halo\\" possible will likely not be disappointing.  For me, its a good alternative to the yapping heads on Fox when driving in to work, if I'm not quite caffeinated and need the first track to kick my butt into gear and the rest to nudge me a bit more gently into awareness.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|After seeing the movie Hunger Games and hearing from others that the books should really be read as well - I purchased the triology.  They were a great read at a great price - better than purchasing them individually in hardcover.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this is the best game ever I love it. it is so fun. you will want to play it everyday.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|When I first got this app I loved it. It was fun, but a little time consuming. You have to play it all the time to really earn points. It also requires lots if acorn points to complete certain things. You don't earn those as fast as gold coin points. So they give you the option to buy acorn points with real money. I don't think so. I never bought any. I liked the game but not that much. I became bored with it and uninstalled it. Bummer. ):
B0079R8IYW|4.0|I use my Fire at meetings to review the minutes of the last meeting and follow the agenda of the current.  I have a Navitech cover for the Fire, however it does not have the ability to hold it upright unless you open it like a book and let it stand in the vertical.  Horizontal is much better for my use.  The Marware Exchange was made to stand up in the horizontal, much easier to use now.  The angle of the display is just right.<br /><br />Watched a movie on the Fire last night and was able to set it on a table by my chair without holding it.  Much, much better and leaves me free to use my hands for more important things like eating popcorn! It is well designed and works well for me.  It has a magnetic closure instead of a snap and small pockets to store notes etc.  Overall I prefer this type of cover now that I have been able to use it for awhile.  Seems well made, the material is quite soft and of good quality.  Being able to put on a pair of ear-buds, move into my own world and watch a movie without holding it is just great!  For reading both are probably about equal.  Hope this helps a bit if you are trying to decide which type of cover is right for you.

B00756GKBA|1.0|all the songs (if i can call them song) sound like her others, being boring, unlistenable and so commercial. She sounds like lady gaga, and lady gaga sounds like her, with their orrible and foreseen songs. I've tried to heard this cd 5 times: it has ruined my days making me sad. Luckly I've sold it. As far as I'm concerned this isn't music.<br />I can't understand why she has to be esplicit: does she think that is the only way to like her?<br />This album is terrible: save your money!

B00005N6KG|3.0|I find these headphones perfect for running. Sound quality is pretty decent, they are lightweight and comfortable, great price; they get the job done. However, my one complaint is durability. I have just ordered my third pair as the circuitry eventually fails and sound in one ear eventually dies. I'm not abusing the headphones too much when I work out, but I seem to only be able to get a few months of use out of them. But hey you get what you pay for, and truthfully at this price and considering the pro's, I'll probably buy a fourth pair if need be should the next set fail. But who knows maybe third times a charm! 4.5 stars had the previous two sets not died.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I have completed the 30 day Shred, and while I wouldn't say that I am shredded, I definitely have become more solid and toned, and I can see ab muscles that I have never seen before in my life.  Not a six-pack by any means, but a good start.  Now, I am 47 years old and have had intermittent problems with my knees as time goes on.  I had to ease my way into this workout for that reason, and usually did 3 days in a row with a day off in-between, combining the workout with some walking on the treadmill until my knees got stronger.  Now, after completing the series, my knees seem to be stronger than before because the muscles in my legs that support them are much stronger and more stable.  Because of the high impact moves, this is a tough workout for some of us older folks, but if you exercise patience, I think it is a great stability builder.  Level 1 kicked my butt for the first few days, and I am already used to doing cardio 4-5 days a week.  Level 2 got me for a couple of days but I adjusted to it easier than level 1.  Level 3 forced me to yell at the DVD and on the 10th day I was glad it was over for awhile.  I found level 3 much more difficult, as it started incorporating some jump training.  I have moved on to No More Trouble Zones now, but plan to go back through the Shred again at some point, alternating between levels each time instead of doing 10 days straight of each level.<br /><br />I was not overweight when I began, just a little jiggly in those places we don't like.  I do not follow Jillian's diet plan, but I do follow my own low carb / lower calorie plan. I consider myself to be somewhat metabolically challenged, so I combined my Shred workout with 30-40 minutes of walking or light treadmill jogging.  I have not weighed or measured because I want to focus on being healthy and strong, but my well-developed muffin top has diminished significantly, and I have experienced noticeable changes in my arms, back, abs, glutes, and ankles (last year's sandal straps are too big).  If you're middle-aged like me, be patient and ease into it to avoid injuries, and it will shape you up and do wonders for your strength and endurance, even if it doesn't \\"shred\\" you.

0307949486|4.0|In all honesty I was a fan of the Swedish renditions of the movies so I figured I should read the book to compare it. As in most cases the book was better than the movie just because there are details in the books that you can't get in the movies.<br />The story essentially has 2 different story lines that mingle together during the telling. You have Mikael Blomkvist, the investigative journalist that becomes a crime investigator to appease an old man. Then you have Lizbeth Salander, the intelligence gatherer that assists Mikael in his hunt for the killer from a 40 year old mystery.<br />I really enjoyed the book and plan to read the rest of the trilogy. I understand that some people are repulsed by the graphic nature of these books and I feel sorry for you that you can't look past that to the story that's being told. The violence is crucial to the story and unfortunately these are things can and do occur outside in reality. So fore warning for anyone weak of heart or stomach, these books are not for you.

B004UXUUJE|4.0|This overlooked gem of a film begins with American journalist Julia Jarmond (the always impeccable Kristin Scott Thomas) searching for information about French Jews captured during WW II.  She is married to a career focused Frenchman.  They are about to move into a new apartment in Paris.  She learns that there is a history with the apartment which was given to the couple by Julia's father-in-law.<br /><br />Through internet information, visits to encampment sites and personal interviews she begins to uncover secrets of what was known as the Vel d'Hiv round-up.  This was not a Nazi orchestrated maneuver but one instituted by the French.  Many Frenchmen believed that imprisoning Jews would save their own hides.  The French would like to ignore this terrible event.  Julia begins to focus on one 10 year old girl named Sarah.  In a haunting performance by Melusine Mayance, Sarah is the lone survivor of her family that was rousted from the apartment 60 years earlier. The apartment that Julia will soon occupy.<br /><br />The film flashes back and forth between the current day investigation and 1942 when the horrible incident occurred.  Sarah carries with her a tremendous burden involving her 4 year old brother as the film moves into the 1960's.  The final act does moves away from the mystery and horror as Julia locates descendents of Sarah and her family.  A bit melodramatic toward the end?  Sure, but it felt somewhat earned as release from the pit-in-stomach feeling that had been built up.  A very good movie.<br /><br />Scott Thomas not only performs the film with her accomplished French but a damn good American accent as well.  The movie is in French and English with subtitles.  The Blu ray disc has a beautiful 1080p transfer and captures the original aspect ratio of 2.35:1.  There is very little guessing as to which time period you're seeing as the look is much different.  The more somber greyish and browns play during the 1942 period.  The current period involves more color and brightness.  The Blu ray is excellent in highlighting the differences.  The lossless DTS-HD Master Audio is superb as well.  Clear in both languages.  Well executed disc.color and brightness.  The Blu ray is excellent in highlighting the differences.

0345803485|1.0|I knew from the beginning, this book was going to be a dud.  It's poorly written, and the same descriptive phrases and wording are used repetitively.  The multiple sex scenes might as well have been copied and pasted over and over again.  They are completely uninspired. Honestly, the sex is not hot at all.  The clumsy, mousy virginal character of Anastasia is an unlikely match for billionaire dom Christian.  I can envision her in sore need of a pedicure and haircut, slopping around the billionaire's digs. She's a dope.  This book is flat and uninteresting.  Don't download it.  You'll be sorry.

B004LROUNG|4.0|To date I have read 22 John Grisham books, beginning with \\"A Time to Kill\\". Humor was added throughout \\"The Litigators\\". Grisham never disappoints.
0345803485|1.0|1. Christian is a hot, classical piano-playing, plane-flying, art-collecting, young, self-made billionaire (and yet he has plenty of time for stalking), who also fights to end world hunger in his spare time. Right-o. And he is &#34;bewitched&#34; by Ana....why exactly? Was it the vomiting, drunk dialing, utter lack of life experience, or constant badgering about his painful past that made him &#34;beguiled&#34; by her?  2. The repetition made me want to stab a pen in my eye. Ana does nothing but flush, stare at her hands, bite her lip, roll her eyes, &#34;hitch&#34; her breath, &#34;quirk&#34; her lips and think, &#34;Oh my!&#34; and &#34;Holy Crap!&#34; Halfway through the book, you'll want to punch her subconscious and inner goddess. And then punch yourself for wasting time on this.  3. No twenty-something American girl says, &#34;I shall miss his boyish charm.&#34; Ever. And she never orders a cup of tea &#34;bag out.&#34; This is just silly.  4. Christian has bronze highlights and long fingers. In case you missed that, he has bronze highlights and long fingers. Get used to hearing about those. He cocks his head to the side A LOT. He also says goofy things like, &#34;You look mighty fine, Miss Steele&#34; and &#34;I feel mighty fine, Miss Steele.&#34; Um, ok.  5. Phrases like, &#34;His voice is warm and husky like dark melted chocolate fudge caramel...or something&#34; will make you roll your eyes and think, &#34;Holy Crap, this book is terrible!&#34; Or perhaps you'll cock your head to the side and say, &#34;This book does not please me. I shall throw it away now.&#34;  6. Ana is an English literature-loving college graduate who outwardly uses words like &#34;profligate&#34; and &#34;gamine&#34; and yet her inner thoughts are complete idiocy  (&#34;Holy Crap!&#34; &#34;Double Crap!&#34; &#34;Triple Crap!&#34; &#34;Crap!&#34; &#34;Jeez!&#34;). Which one is it? Because it can't be both ways.  7. Ana made it to her senior year of college without ever having an email address. Not buying it.  These are just a few of my problems with the book. By the end, I was hoping Ana (without a doubt the most annoying literary character I've ever encountered, with no redeeming qualities whatsoever) would accidentally fall off of Christian's 30th floor balcony.

At first, I thought the songs were very simplistic because of the use of very few different notes per song. Plus, some of them sound like previous Madonna songs; one even sounds a bit like her song from EVITA- You Must Love Me. However, these are really wonderful, exciting, bold tunes. Be forewarned that if you choose this CD version, you WILL be exposed to some pretty foul language, including several gigantic \\"f-bombs\\". Madonna, as usual, went for the shock value. I am SO glad I bought this CD! Now, excuse me while I go for a drive!!!
0385534639|5.0|I don't have much useful to add to the existing reviews, but want to put in my 2 cents that this is one of the most well written books I have read in a long time. The author uses words and descriptions to transport you to a fantastical world and fill you with all the wonder that a visitor to the Night Circus would feel. Reading this book was like going on vacation every time I sat down to read it. A little bit like a grown up Narnia if that makes sense - it generates the same feelings in me now that reading about Narnia did when I was a child. If you're on the fence, just read it. Or read the first chapter. I think you'll know in the first couple of pages if it's something you'll like, although I think it was a couple chapters in before it really sucked me under.
0743486285|5.0|Nikki Sixx has written about part of his life, no holds barred. He is lucky to be alive today, and so are we, his fans. His story pulls at my heart strings. He should be dead and somehow he survived the horrible path in life he chose. Thank God he is now leading a better life. I love you Nikki!

B007BLEKPM|2.0|This was a pretty dull movie and certainly not worth the $4.95 it cost to rent it. Leo really bombed in this one.
B006C45MRE|3.0|It was ok, glad for the rental instead of the movies, family enjoy it more than I did. They said they would watch again.
B0068C9W44|1.0|I like Rhiana for a while now.  However, releasing this many albums is bound to create repetition.  It's a very boring album.  She pretty much sings about how she is gonna have sex with someone in every single song.  Rhiana is hot, so this sounds like a good thing at first, but it gets old after one listen through.<br /><br />Don't bother, just buy the good hits.
B003EYVXT6|4.0|I found Splice to be much more than the 'Species' 'clone' some folk have dubbed it. At least in this film, we can empathize with the poor creature, Dren. I will agree that the acting of the scientist couple is a bit melodramatic and over-the-top... but in the film's defense, genius is often earmarked with strange behavior. In this light, the film shines as a modern day Frankenstein. And believe me when I say that coming from me, that is very high praise indeed.<br /><br />But I can simply wax on the praise when it comes to these reviews. Often, I get slammed for being objective. But there's no objectivity needed in the second half of a BD review: the special features. Specifically, the lack thereof. There is a 35 minute 'spliced' together behind the scenes that doesn't follow any sort of index for contents - it's just kinda there. There first couple of minutes is actually filming the filming, an artsy-feeling thing that you pray isn't the whole feature. And it isn't. The highlights are Adrien Brody cutting up between takes and the girls who actually do the performance of Dren, especially the little girl that plays baby-Dren. Surprisingly, none of the Dren footage is 100% CGI. If we had more special features or even just a commentary track, this review would be a five-star opinion.<br /><br />But as the director states - this is the monster movie he's never seen. And that is a spot-on synopsis, and it is at the end of the day the reason I enjoyed the film as much as I did.
B0001E7LMU|4.0|It's always fun when you're not sure if you should be suspicious of your friends or not. This is one of the few games that can be played with up to 10 players so it's a great game for a large group with high replayability.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this story - well-written, gripping and highly entertaining.  The author creates believable characters, complete with talents and flaws.  An excellent read!
B0050XFY4O|5.0|From Beginning to End,is a very loving story of two brothers. This story is taboo and not many can understand that there is always a love for a sibling and some times it happens to be very intimate. Rafael,Lucas and Joao show this intimate story and the acting is done with love and tenderness for one and other. I recommend this story if one can understand that there are all kinds of love. A caring and loving story and a very well directed film. I would see it again.
B0055V6EZE|5.0|I can't stay still listening to this! I'm sure I look crazy in my car, but who cares? The passion displayed in his music is so easy to hear. I would love to see him do some of these songs in person!

B0038N9WPA|5.0|Compré esta edición de Beat The Devil's Tattoo y superó todas mis expectativas, viene en dos fundas personalizadas muy bonitas, el troquelado de las iniciales B.R.M.C. es un tremendo detalle y el vinyl lado A y B es verde lima, de verdad una de las mejores ediciones que poseo en vinyl, totalmente recomendable y claro a parte de todos los detalles del diseño del disco, el álbum es excelente!
B005L38QK2|4.0|After having it for 4 months the rubberized part of the mouse surface is starting to wear away there my hand touches it. It's rather upsetting.<br /><br />When I first got it, like several other people, there was an issue with the firmware update, rendering the mouse useless.  I contacted their customer service, and they got back to me a week later, but I already had it fixed by then.  You can fix it by simply going to the SteelSeries folder and run the SSEFix.exe file and it will automatically fix it. Problem solved.<br /><br />After playing with it in the Diablo 3 open beta weekend (the game it was meant for) it is really handy.  Especially for playing on Normal where it is really easy and you can get away with just using your one hand on the mouse and don't need to worry about tapping keys for skills and such.<br /><br />For my hand at least, it's extremely comfortable and easy to click, except for the 2 side buttons on the right side, without having my hand awkwardly positioned I can't really get to them.  But being that it's meant to be right and left hand compatible, it's understandable why it doesn't  fit so well.<br /><br />The ability to change the glow patterns and intensity is an added plus, as well as the option to change the buttons and set up profiles to work better with other games.<br /><br />Overall it's a pretty nice mouse, and I'd recommend it for any Diablo fans.
B007VGXS8M|3.0|This app is okay.It should be free and is suited for younger kids.I enjoy the books more because they are more interactive and challenging.

0307891372|2.0|The book almost reads like one of the old D&D manuals, and looks really nice. It weighs in quite heavy and while it does contain useful information, it's nothing that can't be found online. Not only found online, but found easier.

B002RKSZWG|4.0|It feels a bit silly to write a review of one of Jane Austen's last published and perhaps lesser known novels.  Anyone looking at Persuasion has certainly read Pride and Prejudice or Sense and Sensibility, and has a good idea what to expect.  But I'd like to get a few impressions down.<br /><br />Persuasion focuses on Anne Elliot, middle daughter of Sir Walter Elliot and the only person in her family who isn't completely proud and self absorbed.  In her youth, Anne was persuaded to break off a relationship with a naval officer that her family felt was beneath her station.  Eight years later her former beau, Captain Wentworth, is thrown back into her life, much to her discomfort.  She is forced to navigate a passel of family issues and potential suitors in order to find a happy match.<br /><br />There are all the usual elements you can expect in an Austen novel.  It is a wry, incisive look at the foibles of human nature; in this case, a contrast between those who value a person purely on their birth or station, versus those who look to personality and character.  It has various changes of scenery, from the Elliots' traditional home of Kellynch, to the seaside town of Lyme, to Bath, and draws in a host of well drawn characters.  The plot is relationship centered, with one good crisis to drive things forward, and, as I've come to expect, much of it hinges on misunderstanding or deception by characters that aren't all they appear to be on the surface.<br /><br />I liked the book, but I can't say I liked it as much as Austen's more popular novels.  Elsewhere she seems to have written even her foolish characters with a sympathetic hand; we laugh at them, perhaps we pity them, but nowhere else to they come off as so one-sidedly unpleasant as in Anne's father and sisters.  And, by contrast, Anne is almost the perfect heroine from the start, with little room to grow and few mistakes to learn from.  I'm happy I finally read Persuasion--it was the one Austen novel I hadn't read--but it's not the first one I'd recommend.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|the game system is simply exciting yet simple. like it after playing but I end up scratching my to decide what to upgrade. would have more enjoy it if I buy some credit. is there a one time Beginner's. pack that people like me consider paying as gratitute of supporting?
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|This little microphone is wonderful at a fabulous price! I am using with a Canon HFM40 video-cam. Very clear. The only con is not remembering to turn it off(no light to remind me) and I don't know the life of the battery so I will get an extra to have on hand.<br />I had purchased a wireless for about $150 and it was horrible. Returned it for this little gem. I do not move around when recording so the cord is fine for me... it is quite long though.<br />Excellent product for the price.
B0068RHGJM|4.0|It seems like since they kicked Tarja out the guys have been hell bent on proving that they were the creative force all along.  Well, there certainly is enough here to convince anyone that they are VERY competent musicians.  This album is impressive as anything else, but...  It's just not as much fun to listen to.  All the other albums had a couple songs that were just a blast.  There isn't a great track on this album that stands out (to me, anyway).  Sure, it's all good, but it's just not nearly as much fun as thier other stuff.  It reminds me of Symphony X...  Sure, they are justified in calling this thier masterpiece... but I'm probably going to listen to Once & Wishmaster a lot more than this one.  And no, it's not a Tarja v. Annette thing, it's just that the band isn't writing the kinds of songs that I liked them for anymore.  I like Annette fine, but I actually like Tarja's last solo album better than this one. I guess it's just that this album feels a little bloated to me.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The third installment of this series is by far my favorite of all three.  To see Christian evolve into the man that he does and be \\"freed\\" of most of his demons made it a true love story.  Through out the series Christian is always trying to protect Ana, but in the end she protected him and his family.  I wish there was a 4th book because there is so much more that you can expand on.  I have never read a series of books in a such a small amount of time as I did with these.  I enjoyed these books so much that I want to read them again.
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|I cried when i heard this album. just watched the documentary showing how this album was recorded in grohl's garage on analog tape as well. in this day and age, this rock album's authenticity is rare, but this quality of rock music is rarer (if that's a word).
B003719G40|4.0|I thought it was a good book, worth the read. Gives good insight into how people respond to different forms of praise and love.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|No issues...Not sure what the update was for, but its still great! Moto Xoom, Droid 4 and Droid Razr. Will consume hours of ur time!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a great Bible app because it is easy to search and find what you need. It has lots of versions too. I have it on my kindle and my smart phone.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games is a great book I never read books unless they are scary, like by Dean Koontz and my son told me to read this one, I had it finished in two days. Now I have read all three and they are great, just make sure you watch and make sure that your child is the right age before they read it. The movie was tamed down a lot for the big screen to make a PG13 rating. Overall It is a great book and I say read it.. and if your child is the right age have them read it too it is a great read!
B005KP7EK4|1.0|So... you're telling me that Blackthorn can shoot out oil lanterns at 20+ paces, in a dark mine shaft, but he can't shoot a fat, black rabbit from three feet away? And, when he misses, he picks up a rock?<br /><br />And... you're also telling me that his horse would run off, never to be seen again?<br /><br />I got 30 minutes into this melodrama and had to shut it off. You'd have to be a simpleton to appreciate this flick.
0439023491|5.0|The beginning of the book is really slow and just builds the story in the middle and end of the book. This book was not as great as the first one, but it still was a good book.
B007MNV5WU|4.0|Thr game is good. Highly polished, etc. At present, Im not sure though if the Kindle Fire version's price is warranted. The price is 2.99 and yet for that much you get astonishingly little. The level design doesn't seem as good compared to that in Seasons. The new gravity features seem gimmicky after a while.<br /><br />Still, if you're looking for something to eat time with, this'll do you just fine.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Loved the books! Much more convenient to buy the trilogy on my kindle than the books seperately.  Read the books after watching the movie and can't wait for the second installment!
0385342063|5.0|Originally reviewed at: [...]<br />Rating: 5 out of 5 biscuits<br /><br />I had no doubts about whether I would like this book or not since Kinsella has been one of my favourite authors for many years, but she managed to WOW me once again. You think you've seen it all before? Well, brace yourself - you're in for another treat!<br /><br />There's literally nothing Sophie Kinsella cannot do. I picked up I've Got Your Number the other night, thinking I'd read a few pages before going to bed. Three hours and 130 pages later I was still clutching my Kindle, not wanting to let go. I swear I say this every time I finish one of her books but this has to be my favourite novel of hers so far. Well, maybe it's a tie between this one and Twenties Girl, I don't know. All I know is, it's unputdownable.<br /><br />I'm trying not to sound like an obsessed fangirl here (and failing miserably) but it really is that good. There's a bit of a similarity between her books in terms of characters and plot but do you know what? I don't even care. Poppy is an entertaining protagonist who, along with Sam, makes this book as good as it is. If you've read Kinsella's novels before then you know what to expect: a laugh-out-loud plot, witty and funny characters, laughter, and some tears along the way. There's only a few authors who manage to make me smile and cry at the same time and Kinsella is one of them.<br /><br />Character-wise, I would say Poppy and Sam were my two favourites. Poppy is a bit clumsy, someone who tends to feel inferior to others and rarely dares to stand up for herself and confront other people, even if she's right. I loved how much she changed by the end of the novel. Sam is your typical businessman who has confidence, power, but at the same time, some of his comments just made me laugh out loud - and as it turns out, there's a more vulnerable side to him as well.<br /><br />As for the plot, all I'm going to say is that it's brilliant. It's full of twists and turns and I almost never say this but I wouldn't mind if there was a sequel to this book. You know that feeling when you find a really good book and by the time you finish it, it's as if you had to say goodbye to your best friends? That's how I feel about Poppy and Sam, and Kinsella's characters in general. I just didn't want the story to end.<br /><br />I would strongly recommend this book to anyone who's looking for an entertaining read or a swoon-worthy romance - I guarantee you won't be disappointed. It's another masterpiece from the `Queen of Chick Lit' - simply perfect. I just can't praise this enough. Do pick it up and you'll see I'm right.ost never say this but I wouldn't mind if there was a sequel to this book.

B001H1WXWO|3.0|This had a lot of terrible violence, which was an actual recreation of something tragic that happened, yet it was morbid and unhappy and left me with a bad feeling. There was not one thing I could hang onto that was hopeful or uplifting. Had I known it was full of scenes of someone getting brutally raped and beaten over and over again I wouldn't have watched it.<br />It is not my kind of movie.<br /><br />I do admire Hillary Swank and no one could have pulled off this transformation into a male better. Unfortunately there were far too many gratuitous scenes of her naked, bleeding, bruised and beaten, alternating with scenes of her naked, and having other people's hands all over her face and body and hair alternating with scenes of people pulling her clothes off. Did I say gratuitous?<br /><br />Spoiler alert, stop reading if you don't want to know the story...<br /><br />A certain Texas impoverished redneck trailer park mood was created and it was easy to see from the time we saw the two disgusting backwoods thugs that something horrible would happen to Brandon when they found out he was really a she. The rapes and beatings toward the end came as no surprise.<br /><br />Violence, drinking, stints in jail, self destructive urges and acts, and a slightly built young woman running around pretending to be a boy and having sex with the girls is a recipe for disaster in this sorry town.<br /><br />Brandon had a winning grin and very warm smile which rarely left his face, and huge ultrawhite teeth and very full lips that I have not seen on any men,<br />along with a tiny neck and no adam's apple, but these people were a little dim and didn't notice anything amiss with Mr. Brandon as long as he partied and got drunk with them every night. If Brandon were in most towns he would be regarded with deep suspicion I think.<br /><br />Brandon was very clevor about the sex act with his girlfriend. She couldn't even tell it wasn't the real McCoy. And when she finally saw Brandon in the women's jail and he/she admitted to being a \\"hermaphrodite\\" she couldn't care less what Brandon was, she was just so in love. The brutes who killed him probably would have found another victim to kill at some point. Brandon was a convenient excuse to exercise some pent up aggression.<br /><br />I gave it three stars for the acting, particularly Miss Swank's, but left off two stars for the horrific scenes and constant pawing at the nude body of the transgendered girl. Clearly she would never leave this hellaceous town alive. This movie was well done yet very predictable and as gratuitous as they come at the same time. I could have done without seeing it personally.<br />The rapes and violence turned my stomach.the women's jail and he/she admitted to being a \\"hermaphrodite\\" she couldn't care less what Brandon was, she was just so in love.

0312117337|5.0|I own several Tarot/Oracle Decks but The Osho Zen Tarot has captured my heart. I think this is a deck that anyone can relate to.<br /><br />You don't have to be a psychic, lightworker, and etc to use these cards. Each card deals with a different aspect of your life. The artwork is extraordinary.. I really enjoy working these cards.<br /><br />I have done reading for my friends with these cards and every message that was given was a message they needed.<br /><br />I have to admit when I first used them, I felt the cards didn't \\"know\\" me.. but in hindsight it was a message I needed.

B0079XNWQA|4.0|In reading other reviews of \\"Love is a Four Letter Word,\\" I have noticed two main threads: those who criticize Mraz for more fully embracing the peace-and-love vibes that made him popular with the release of \\"I'm Yours\\" ca. 2008, and those who admire his willingness to take a new direction and still be playful and creative with the music. In either case, I think we can all agree that \\"Love\\" is a far cry from Mraz's days a curbside prophet, a geek in the pink, or a dynamo of volition. Then again, in reminiscing on his old albums, I see that a lot of those tracks in isolation could make Mraz seem just as flat and over-produced as many accuse him of being now. The truth about Mr. A-Z is that you really do have to be a dedicated fan to understand what he is capable of and to overlook some of the indiscretions that happen in the studio. Because I believe Jason to be a true musician, he is most definitely better in a live setting, where the creativity and spontaneity that make him so lovable are given freer expression. There is no doubt that he is talented, but I will admit that I had my doubts about whether or not I would like this album. In the words of a friend who dislikes \\"I'm Yours\\" just as much as I do, the world does not need another Jack Johnson. While I love the idea of a man and his acoustic guitar, it is easy for that kind of music to slide into the realm of the utterly uninspired.<br /><br />All that having been said, I do not regret purchasing this album. Per the usual, Mraz is ultimately successful in delivering songs that are lovely and worth the listen, even if some are less memorable. I agree with other reviewers that songs like \\"Living in the Moment\\" remind us that Jason is still trying to meet the expectations of younger fans who were converted to his style in the wake of \\"I'm Yours\\" and its startling popularity. I know there are a lot of \\"I Won't Give Up\\" fans out there as well, but I write that off as the perfunctory popular hit single that I normally don't appreciate as much anyway.<br /><br />If there is one reason I can recommend this album to you, it's as simple as this: it speaks to me. While it's true that the lyrics of \\"Love\\" are far less playful and quick-witted than we've seen on previous albums, they are still very rich in their simplicity and, in typical Mraz fashion, self-aware. While a lot of the topics he takes up (love, peace, freedom, family) could be deemed worn-out or cliche, he finds a way to deliver the message in a way that is refreshingly sincere. Really. I believe him when he says something as simple as \\"It's not hard for me to love you,\\" and I realize how comfortably that line made its way into my heart. I really have internalized several of the songs on the album, as much for the message as for the music. For example, I probably listened to \\"93 Million Miles\\" at least two dozen times on the very evening that I bought the album; it was a powerful reminder that even when our sources of light seem so far away, home is always close at hand. The whole tenor of the album has to do with the art of living abundantly, which we come to learn is almost indistinguishable from the gift of loving abundantly. There is nothing trite about that, at least not in regards to Mraz's delivery.<br /><br />Other favorites of mine: \\"The World As I See It,\\" which has what a YouTube commenter refers to as a \\"kind of 70's earnestness to it.\\" I love the vibe and the texture. Similarly, \\"Be Honest\\" (feat. Inara George) was a treat for me; I would take this over the Colbie Caillat duet any day. It almost has a bossa nova feel to it, which makes it perfect for shooting the breeze out on the porch. \\"5/6\\" is another good track for those interested in Jason's jazzy side, and it is one of the more musically complex offerings on the album. I love the horns on \\"The Freedom Song\\" (they were my first smile of the album, maybe because they reminded me of \\"Make it Mine\\").<br /><br />All in all, a good album to remind us that \\"we've got some joy in this thing\\" and that \\"the world... is a remarkable place.\\" For anyone still on the fence about it, I would implore you to \\"Hear just what your heart has to say\\" because this album really will speak to your heart if you let it. It may or may not meet your standards of sophistication if you're a music snob, but it is honest, and that means worlds to me as a music-lover, a twentysomething, and someone who believes in feeding the soul. Jason will do right by you.
B007MNV5WU|4.0|Game is great, got through it really quick. But maybe it should of been $0.99 or maybe have more levels. I do recommend that if you don't mind adds you try the free version first.

B007SYWFRM|3.0|I figured out how to get around the problem of not being able to leave the game, although I understand that's a valid complaint for many. My issues are the inability to visit or add friends, and the constant admonitions to restart the game and install an update that doesn't appear to exist. now the challenges are starting to try to force me to purchase acorns in order to complete, which I refuse to do. Im not sure how much longer I'll be playing. It's too bad, too, since the game has so much potential that it isn't living up to.

I got 2 separate emails, the first saying 17 April, the second saying 7 May so that was confusing. However, they did arrive on my door step on the 17 April so only just under a 4 week wait.

B0043U98RY|5.0|Spartacus Season 1 arrived promptly and was exactly what I was seeking since I started into the series in Season 2 and liked it so much I wanted to get the history from the beginning. This is a great series...
B004EPYZV2|4.0|This review may contain some spoilers about the movie.<br /><br />After a bombing of the Kremlin brands the IMF agency as terrorists, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his team of operatives (Jeremy Renner, Simon Pegg, and Paula Patton)go on a secret mission to clear their agency's name, by attempting to thwart a plot to start a nuclear war. During the mission, Ethan will have to escape a prison, chase down a villain during a sandstorm, scale the Burj Khalifa, and fight a crazy Russian guy inside of an epic parking garage.<br /><br />This is definitely my favorite MI movie. It's loaded with amazing action sequences, but still has a gripping story. The visuals will leave you breathless, I mean, the scene where Tom Cruise is climbing up the Burj Khalifa makes you feel like you are there. When the camera looks down, and you see how far up he is, you get butterflies in your stomach. I especially liked the fight in the parking garage; it was definitely a great location for an action flick like this.<br /><br />Yet again, the cars are awesome. In Mission Impossible 3, it was the Lamborghini Gallardo, in this movie it's the 2014 BMW i8, which is insanely nice. There is also a good amount of comedy in this movie. Most of it provided by the always hilarious Simon Pegg. And as I mentioned before, even though there is a lot of action, it isn't mindless; there's a good story to it. It's thrilling and will have you at the edge of your seat the whole time. And if you thought they had forgotten all about Ethan Hunt's wife from the last movie, then you would be wrong, very wrong. They don't make up a stupid story to leave her out at all. Just watch :)<br /><br />The only part I didn't really like because I guess it made no sense at all was when (WARNING MAJOR SPOILERS) the Russian guy jumps off of the ramp in the garage, smashes his face into the windshield of a car, and then proceeds to plummet like 30 feet into the ground. And he is still stinking alive! I know most of the things in this movie aren't things that would ever happen, but, come on. The guy would be almost dead after crashing into the windshield of a car that far up, and then when he reaches the point of hitting the ground he would REALLY be dead. (END OF MAJOR SPOILERS) That's obviously not plausible, but I'm willing to overlook it being that the rest of the movie was fantastic.<br /><br />Now the DVD and case itself. The case is obviously just like any other Blu-ray cases. But the one I purchased comes with the Blu-ray version of the movie with special features, the regular DVD version, and a digital copy for download. Special features include some nice deleted scenes and an alternate opening. All of that is great and I suggest getting this version.<br /><br />Overall, almost everything about this movie is awesome, and the two-disc Blu-ray version is the way to go.  This is the best mission yet!<br /><br />Pros: Great action, but not mindless. Good comedy, gripping story. Nice special features. Best MI ever.<br /><br />Cons: An unrealistic scene that made no sense because of the outcome. That's just a personal gripe of mine that I'll overlook.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|The author does a remarable job of placing you in north Korea and inside the lived of the people there. Her writing of this story is lovely and brings the harsh realities to life.

B000P0J0G0|5.0|Two of the best comedians joined forces and the resulting shows are brilliant!  Hugh Laurie is known best for \\"House\\" in the US, however, his earlier work in the UK is outstanding.  His portrayal of Bertie Wooster to Stephen Fry's Jeeves in the series Jeeves and Wooster [P.G. Wodehouse's books]is another gem.<br /><br />I feel I am getting \\"two for one\\" in A Bit of Fry and Laurie. If what you are looking for is good writing, great acting and wonderful laughs, this is the collection for you.

B0071R43MG|5.0|UPDATE 4/25/2012 - All is right with the world again and I'm bumping this disc up to it's rightful 5 stars - apparently I had Dynamic Range Control (DRC) turned on several weeks ago within my OPPO BDP-80's menu settings and I forgot to turn it off. By turning off DRC, both the DD 5.1 and TrueHD 7.1 opened up and equaled the volume level of the PCM stereo. Now that the empty pit in my stomach has subsided I can finally enjoy this Blu-Ray in all it's glory! Thank you Joe and the Lamoureux brothers for putting this together for us hardcore fans!<br /><br />PREVIOUS REVIEW 4/24/2012 - First off, regarding Amazon, I pre-ordered this last month via Prime shipping and received it today on release date (I was hoping to get it earlier since Amazon is often good about that). Aside from the fact that Amazon needs to correct certain details (it is, in fact, a single disc), they did at least deliver on release date and their price beats everyone else out there. Thank you, Amazon.<br /><br />Now, with regards to the Blu-Ray itself...<br /><br />* Sound - while stereo listeners won't have much to complain about - PCM 2.0 48/24 sound is \\"constant, accurate and intense\\", the surround fans, like myself, will be disappointed - in comparison to the stereo playback, the Dolby Digital 5.1 (yes, you read that right) volume is reduced by about 50% while the Dolby TruHD 7.1 is reduced about 60% with a very weak surround mix to boot, especially during the first 30 minutes of the show. I cannot comment on the 3D portion of the disc, unfortunately, as my OPPO BDP-80 is not equipped for that, but I had just viewed segments of The Police' 'Certifiable' and Joe Bonamassa' 'Live At Beacon Theatre' the night before and the 5.1 was glorious as always. Perhaps my copy is from a bad batch, but dare I suggest that a replacement disc swap is needed to remedy this issue as many home theatre enthusiasts are not shelling out their hard earned cash to upgrade to 3D Blu-Ray and 7.1 surround so they can enjoytheir favorite artists performing live through two friggin' speakers!<br /><br />* Video - incredible resolution, great camera work with only a few questionable moments, no choppy editing or horrendous special effects a la Joe's Live In Paris DVD (coincidentally, this release was also plagued with sound issues and a low-profile disc swap offer was announced on satriani.com when they had supposedly fixed the audio - I sincerely hope this doesn't become a pattern with Joe's future live releases!) In short, Joe and Co. have never looked better on film - speaking of which, Joe, if you're reading this review, PLEASE consider giving your fans a Blu-Ray of Live In SF and the 1st G3!<br /><br />* Extras - two tracks filmed in B/W during sound check and a 43 minute segment surrounding the \\"Black Swans...\\" recording and tour - PQ again is wonderful here and audio is fine during these sections, but playback is limited to DD 5.1 and/or stereo. Entertaining and informative nonetheless.<br /><br />* Packaging/menu - typical BD case, non-digipak. Menu is easy enough to navigate but a little generic for 2012 - what's with the X's in the corners? I guess you could say this makes it PC for a PC ... ?<br /><br />Well, there you have it. To sum up, excellent PQ, nice set list and performance from Joe and the band (Mike Keneally on keys makes an awesome contribution to the sound), disappointing 5.1 and 7.1 SQ in 2D, decent extras, all in a single disc package. Four stars rather than five due to the surround sound issues I experienced.
B005ZMUZDU|5.0|I accidentally purchased this movie by downloading it.  I have NO idea how to view it.  So my advice to all of you is to make sure if its a DVD you want and not a download, proofread your order!!

1433503794|4.0|I found this study Bible rich with notes that are not usually found in other studt Bibles. One could almost use it as an additional resource if he or she were completing an Old Testament or New Testament course in seminary. I usually read from the New King James Version  when I preach or teach in a church or seminary. I had noticed that many of the young conservative students seems to prefer the ESV translation. I recently purchased the ESV study Bible to see what all the fuss was about. I was impress with the translation. My only negatve concerning this study Bible is that the print is too small. This created some difficulty when reading. I noticed that I do not read from this Bible as much as my other translations because of this. If you want a great translation with awsome study notes and have an above average eyesight, then I highly recommend this study Bible.

0380730405|5.0|The tagline of this book, \\"the classic tale of romantic suspense\\", is rather misleading. False advertisement, if you will. It's not a romance novel. Perhaps, some readers see it that way, but I most certainly do not. Yes, there is a love interest, but there isn't much romance. It's really a mysterious and intense ghost story without a ghost, as told through the eyes of a psychologically flawed young woman.<br /><br />I am told that the opening line of this novel is quite famous. \\"Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley again.\\" Maybe that line ropes in some readers, but not me. I found the first couple of chapters confusing and disorienting. Perhaps that is the author's intention -- to disorient the reader before placing her in a surreal time and place. I don't know. But, after five chapters, I found my footing and really got into the book.<br /><br />At the beginning of the story, the narrator accompanies an older American woman who is traveling in Monte Carlo. There, the narrator meets a gentleman, who eventually asks her to marry him. She accepts and then moves into Manderley, the home haunted by the ghost of the gentleman's late wife. Except that there isn't really a ghost, and that makes the book even creepier.<br /><br />Du Maurier masterfully creates an intensely eerie atmosphere full of mystery that verges on horror. The driveway to Manderley isn't just a driveway, it's a serpent. The grounds of Manderley don't just have some flowers, they are rhododendrons of a slaughterous red. Mrs. Danvers isn't introduced simply as the head of the household staff. She is \\"someone tall and gaunt, dressed in deep black, whose prominent cheek-bones and great, hollow eyes gave her a skull's face, parchment-white, set on a skeleton's frame.\\"<br /><br />The words simmer slowly in your mind and insidiously place you in the mind of the highly anxious and frightened narrator. The characterization is spot on. Our young female narrator begins as a typical youth, anxious to please, uncertain, and self-conscious - traits that are somewhat relatable. But then, du Maurier inches the characterization outside the realm of normal so slowly that you almost don't notice it until you've been inside the head of a psychologically disturbed woman for the past hundred pages.<br /><br />I highly recommend this well-written novel. The mystery and tension are layered so thickly that reading about a ringing telephone actually made me jump just as much as in a horror movie. Crafting that level of intensity is no easy feat, and du Maurier has done so masterfully.ncertain, and self-conscious - traits that are somewhat relatable.

1433503794|5.0|Heavy, thick, and full of information.  You won't want to read this while lying in bed, your chest and stomach will be bruised.  Plan on reading this thing at your desk or kitchen table.<br /><br />The verse notes are comprehensive. Much of the difficult theology is addressed unlike in my NIV Life Application Study Bible which often glosses over tough topics.  The maps and diagrams do a great job giving you a true visualization of the stories making them easier to fully understand.  The articles are wonderful and really set this study bible apart from the others.  They offer a ton of info on theology, the reliability of scripture, how to read the bible, etc.<br /><br />The quality of the materials are very nice, too.  The bible lays flat as it claims, and the binding appears very strong.  I purchased the Trutone in Brown/Cordovan ISBN 978-1433503795 and am very pleased with the look.  I've used it daily for over 7 months and it still looks new.<br /><br />Highly recommended for anyone seeking a daily study bible that will hold up to the use and enrich your biblical understanding.  I'm very thankful for the people at Crossway for the release, and the scholars who placed such high demands on their final product.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|Im not a not a big reader but when i started reading this book i could not put it down! I finished it in 3 days. It takes alot for a book to keep me interested but this one was amazing. Now im on the 5th book in the series and im still addicted. I would definitly recommend this book! Amazing book series!
B005K17RU0|5.0|Accurate when I have needed it to be.  Love the 15 day outlook. Wish the radar loop was longer.  The lifestyle aspect is a great treat as well.
B0036T1RMM|3.0|This is classic Paul Thomas Anderson. He offers an interplay of interesting characters and you just stand back and enjoy the spectacle as their lives clash and intertwine. I couldn't help be fascinated by their stories. I'd recommend this movie as a rental. It was interesting but it's not a film I'm anxious to see again and again.
0439023513|5.0|I was so excited when this finally arrived. It looked brand new and arrived so soon!! And it was cheaper than most stores! Very happy
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|this app glitches out all the time which is super annoying when you're making something that takes lots of resources like a brick and then you don't get it because the game freezes when you go to collect. will stop playing if not updated soon.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|some games are fun... some are not. kept me entertained for awhile. I had fun playing it and I guess that was what I wanted
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|It was hard not to read these books.  I picked up my Kindle at every available time I could.  The story moved in such amazing twists and turns that I never imagined.  I was sorry when it ended.
B0034KZE9U|1.0|I ordered these to replace a pair of old KLOGS brand chef shoes.  I loved my KLOGS, but they were old and a few poeple at work suggested I try CROCS.  I am very sad to say, they are very hot, offer little to no support(amd the foot space is so tight you can't add inserts), and after only owning them a short while the non-slip bottoms are already coming off.  Wish I could get my money back and go buy a pair of KLOGS.
0061992860|5.0|Ordered this version because I wanted a compact version for my kit. Its perfect for the use easy to read and very useful.
0345803485|4.0|I read the first book and swore i wouldn't read the 2nd much less the 3rd, but you really have to read the 2nd then the 3rd........I liked it, but still not sure why, she keeps repeating certain phrases over and over again, not the greatest writing, but, obviously there is something about these books that make so many people read them .....it's a mystery, but totally easy, light reading.
0345803485|5.0|Where to begin...I, like the rest of the planet, loved these books. I loved the dynamic between clumsy unsure Ana and cool and confident Christian. As the books go on Ana becomes more confident and as Christian's past is revealed he is much more vulnerable. The characters have depth and personality. I highly enjoyed this trilogy (the first book was my fav). I can't wait to see what this author comes up with next. I loved the flashback to Christian's childhood at the end of the third book and would be very interested to read a book from Christian's POV from childhood through Mrs. Robinson and how he became who he is. I highly recommend.
B005DC68NI|5.0|I downloaded the book expecting it to be like many others of its kind. Half fluff and pep-talk, half stuff I already know or could easily learn by following the Kindle publishing guide, and half interesting and useful. ... That's 150%, but you know what I'm saying. Instead, Let's Get Digital took out the fluff and included everything I wanted to read.<br /><br />In fact, it was a page turner. I'm in the middle of reading two epic novels in series that I love, but I couldn't put down (electronically speaking) Let's Get Digital to return to them. It both sparked my desire to do more for my self-publishing and gave me information I needed to do better. Okay, a third of it was pep-talks, that is, success stories from other authors in self-publishing, but instead of fluff, it was interesting and helpful to see that I could do it and things to watch out for.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Excellent game online & offline!! What else can a person ask for!? I hope to find other such great deals. Play it on my kindle fire.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I am in much pain from my current health condition. Sometimes the pain is so severe that it won't even let me pray.<br />That's when I turn to my Angry Birds and  most of the time they manage to distract me from my misery.<br />I don't care for the music they chose, so I play it almost always in silent mode, if not for that I would rate 5 stars.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Bought it, loved it, can't wait for more.  Why is this not on the top 10 in Amazon Books?  Could have waited to \\"BORROW\\" it but I'm glad I didn't....GREAT story, well written...couldn't stop reading.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|This app is a great app. I play it before I go to bed.. Wish I as faster at it but that's not the games fault.
0345803485|1.0|Years of buying books from Amazon...never once have I wanted my money back, until now . This book was such childish claptrap that I could hardly believe my eyes. Has this author ever read a book ? Anais Nin, Erica Jong ? These women know how to write erotic literature for grown ups.<br />Hard believe there are four more of these books. The author can NOT write  a lick ; but boy howdy, does she have a great marketing plan.

B0043RSJ8G|5.0|Zoe and Max Baxter want nothing more to in the world than to have a child. Both have fertility issues and have been unable to conceive on their own. Modern medicine appears to be their only hope but even with that, luck has not been on their side. They've already gone through the heartbreak of two miscarriages. Finally though, it seems that their wish may come true....Zoe is pregnant again, everything has gone well and they are just a few months away from the anticipated birth of their son.<br /><br />This is how this book starts. I really don't want to say another word about what happens from here because to do so would not only constitute potential \\"spoiling\\" but more importantly would take away from the pleasure of potential readers who might want to experience this book for themselves.<br /><br />This explores a wide gamut of emotional topics including (but not limited to) marriage, parenthood, sibling relationships, sexual orientation, religion, depression, addiction....really, I could go on and on.<br /><br />Jodi Picoult is a shining star among current popular authors. I've read several of her works and each one has been a masterpiece. She is able to take a controversial and emotional situation and put her reader right into the middle of it. She makes me feel as if I am a part of the story...as if I have an investment in the outcome. She never hesitates to \\"go there.\\" I don't feel as if I'm reading a fictional account...I feel like I'm living through a set of circumstances that could happen to anyone.<br /><br />Every time I finish another of her books, I think it's the best one she's ever written and this was no exception.

B0055SWM08|5.0|With all those positive reviews, it was a no-brainer to download this game when it was the FAOTD.  I couldn't be more pleased.  Simple concept, simply fantastic execution.  This game is easily worth the price.  Droid RAZR Maxx

B005D646RE|5.0|I am relatively new to Breaking Bad, always heard about the show and figured it wasnt my cup of tea.<br />I decided to give it a try after much talk.<br />Started with Season 1 and am now almost finished with season 4.<br /><br />This series is without a doubt simply the BEST show on TV. period.<br /><br />I can remember watching The Sopranos and dreading the day that the final episode ended. That is exactly how I feel<br />about Breaking Bad...they dont make shows anymore with a plot, characters, and all around great entertainment<br />like this anymore. Hats off to Vince Gilligan and all the superior actors in the series!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book is something that interested me. This is where he whole story starts to unravil & gets you wanting more. Histories of the characters  come into play and really get you waning more. In his book you reall feel for all the characters
B0079R8IYW|4.0|This cover is a sleek black design for the Kindle Fire. The cover easily fits in to the tab to prop it up for movie viewing. I like the magnetic closure plus soft suede inside. Although the pocket for money or receipts, etc, is a nice addition. I don't think the slots for credit cards would be of good use for me personally. All in all--a very nice cover.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book downstreamed to my Kindle immediately.  Plan to order the other 2 in the series, and also see the movie.

B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Amazon delivered the trilogy to my kindle within seconds.  I was planning to read it on a upcoming cruise.  Problem I had was that the three books was delivered as one large book.  I could not tell how close I was to ending book one and starting book two.  They should really seperate the books.
B0050AV5MW|1.0|I've bought this because it was cheaper then buying all of the 4 books separately. But as I was taking a look through the book(s) I noticed it was very poorly designed. Not just compared to individual editions of Song of Ice & Fire books, but to most of the books in Kindle edition.<br /><br />I'd recommend buying separate books instead of this one, even if you will pay a bit more.
B007JRU2UK|3.0|i thought the plot moved along slow, reaction to the premus unrealistic. we really don't get to know the character this movie is about. not georges best effort

B0067QPVD2|5.0|I know there are a lot of people who did not like this movie and gave it a poor review.  I am not one of those people.  I liked it and enjoyed the upgrades to the 1982 version as well as the story enhancement in the form of a prequel.  The subject matter of not trusting the person standing next to you was at the core of the Carpenter version and was what made it great.  You get that same feeling here, as you expect, and the acting across the board is solid.  There is not a lot of character development explored but there was not much in the 82 version either.  That is probably a good thing because there are not a lot of people left standing in the end so the less you care about them the easier it is to see their fates played out.<br /><br />You do not have to see the Carpenter version to enjoy this film but for me it helped.  This is especially the case at the end as the filmmakers did a great job of tying this story to the 82 version.  It is such a great transition that watching this movie then the 82 film right after makes a lot of sense and was the first thing I wanted to do.  So if you have not seen the 82 film then watch it right after this one.  Not everything between the two movies syncs perfectly but there is more then enough to make the connection.  There are also a lot of things the two films have in common, again as you would expect.  The sets look the same, many of the scenes feel identical, the creature look is the same although much better with modern special effects.  All of these things make for a smooth transition between the two films going from this prequel to Carpenter's version.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray itself has very good video quality, not the best I have seen but far from the worst.  The audio is good when it needs to be but this is not an audio track that will match up with a disc like Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol but then again the filmmakers never intended it to be.  Basically the movie plays on Blu-Ray as the filmmakers intended it toand if there is any fault it would be in the way it was made as opposed to any issue with the product.  I love director's commentaries and I really enjoyed the one on this disc.  Not all commentaries are interesting but this one was and I love to hear about the creative process behind what you see on screen.<br /><br />Overall I really enjoyed this movie and like all films the best way to watch them is on Blu-Ray. I would recommend this one for sure but realize that not everyone will enjoy it as much as I did.
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|Often books written for young adults still resonate for me, but hunger games, although containing some novel ideas, was a disappointment. Plot was thin, and really didn't vary much in the three books. Maybe the films will be better

B00634GHJA|5.0|Picasa doesn't recognize my Galaxy Nexus, and I've had trouble connecting with Bluetooth. I had months worth of photos on my phone. This app solved my problem! Within a few minutes, it transferred 286 photos to my computer! Great job, folks.
B003MC5N28|1.0|This book to me was frusterating.  i didn`t like how the people were called males and females.  I thought that the book had a GREAT concept and plot but something about the book was just frusterating.  I recommend this book just for the experience of reading it, but I warn you that it is very different.  l guess that l just had higher expectations than it could fulfill.
0802473156|5.0|This book is incredible. It's eye opening. It explains why it's so hard to connect with someone even though you know you love them and that they love you. Learning to identify which \\"language\\" I need to feel loved and to express my love to someone in their language is like unlocking the secret to romantic expression. I read a copy of this book from a friend, then the next day bought two copies for myself and my wife.

0439023521|3.0|I am amused at the critiques on the book; the one stars.  Folks, it's not that serious. Someone actually picked the book apart with about 21 points of contention.  Really?<br />Any book that gets a young person to read is okay by me.  I'd rather them READ a book than sit around playing video games.  By the way, I liked it. Was it the best storyline, the best well written book I've ever read?  No.  But who cares.  It was entertaining.

0553801473|4.0|Hated this book. Hated this book!! But that was only the first time I read it.  I thought the editing was heinous where it was present, but mostly absent.  The plot was s-t-r-e-t-c-h-e-d over a thousand pages of cheesy travelogue & I hated what had transpired (mostly nothing) to all my favorite characters. I hated the steps backwards in maturity that many of my favorites seemed to have taken, & was straight-out bored by others that had kept me intrigued in the series up to now. I frequently wanted to slap GRRM (in the same way Joffrey is sometimes--but not often enough--slapped silly in the HBO series) for his over-use of the ludicrous term \\"morrow\\", as in \\"on the morrow\\", \\"good morrow\\", etc... I detested the late introduction of Aegon & Connington, as well.<br />  But THEN I re-read the book.  Line for line and paragraph by paragraph, skipping nothing and taking me days and days longer....& I found not only much to appreciate but much to celebrate that I had either skimmed thru, overlooked or even ignored the first time through. Jewels like these: (MANY SPOILERS!)<br />  1) Janos Slynt's deserved beheading--I think I actually cheered out loud!<br />  2) Ser Selmy's hand-to-hand combat in Hizdahr's chambers with Hizdahr's guard...who knew the old dude had it in him? Again, found myself huzzah-ing out loud!<br />  3) Tormund's easy banter with Jon Snow & his shining native intelligence, virtually unmatched by most of the pretentious \\"lords\\" south of the Wall<br />  4) Cersei's \\"Jane Shore\\"-type Walk of Shame, especially when paralleled with her grandfather's mistress's \\"Madame Du Barry\\"-type Stripping of Worldly Goods Bestowed & Proper Booting off the Lannister Property, once the old man died---2 events straight from the history books & borrowed to great effect here<br />  5) Moquorro's fortuitous rescue from the mast of the sinking ship (a great visual there), and his healing by fire of Victarion's arm, potentially foreshadowing yet another way Jon could be \\"healed\\", as opposed to dying/warging/wighting/pulling a Dondarion?<br />  6) The \\"Ugly Little Girl's\\" poisoned coin assasination...in addition to the novel, excruciatingly descriptive way a selected face \\"adheres\\" to one's own.  Enthralling!<br />  7) The Freys/Manderlys/Boltons getting cabin fever in the Great Hall at Winterfell & constantly at one another's throats, especially when the off-stage murders start in thick & nasty<br />  8) \\"Pork Pie\\" served Ser Manderly-style....might have put me off pot pies forever!<br />  9) Missandei hearing, when no one else does, the dragon Viserion scratching himself a cave out of the pyramid wall<br />  10) Bran \\"possibly\\" calling to Theon in the Godswood?<br />  11) Val walking out of the north wood, her task for Jon complete, Ghost by her side, regal & glorious as hell!<br />  12) Pycelle finally biting the dust, after 5 long books wherein he was a constant cringing worm---even excusing his age<br />  13) The vivid battle in the Deepmotte woods between the Ironborn & Stannis's hill tribes...for a few minutes, I wasn't sure whose side I was actually on, & I'm still sure it was Asha's!<br />  14) Davos Seaworth off in search of Rickon, on his way to a very bad place<br /><br />  And much, much more!  I almost forgot Dany's annoying regressive characterization (THIS was the woman who fired life into the dragons?), Tyrion's mostly pointless adventures which went nowhere (the female dwarf is eye-rolling in the extreme!), Jon's constant wrongness when he is trying to make \\"noble\\" decisions (& his tasteless \\"demise\\"---how can someone rewrite the \\"Jane Shore\\" history so elegantly and yet fail so miserably at the \\"Ides of March\\" retelling?), the hugely-missed near-absent Jaime, the abysmal drama & death of Quentyn Martell, & most of all, I nearly forgot the too-convenient plot device of Aegon the Actually-Alive-&-Breathing!<br />  I give this book 4 stars for being HUGELY entertaining & original regarding almost all the side characters, butmust skip a 5th star for the lack of forward progression (& unnecessary regression) of the main characters. I am NOT one of you who waited so ungodsly long for this book. however, so I understand where you may be particularly disappointed in plot movement...particularly after Book 4 also went nowhere fast.  That may be worth a star's difference right there.<br />  Still, GRRM can write, decidedly well, & for the above shining moments & others, especially when thinking of the fantasy genre as a whole, I come away favorably inclined---after my 2nd reading!

0545101417|5.0|With the second book in the series, Suzanne Collins did a great job of keeping our attention for every minute of the audiobook.  The reader, same artist as Hunger Games, has an outstanding ability to voice the different characters in the book.  My wife liked Catching Fire better than Hunger Games.  And just like Hunger Games, there are some big surprises which you will enjoy I am sure.<br /><br />Get it!

B004SBQGHS|5.0|I got hooked on this game on my iPhone, so I had to have it for my Kindle Fire.<br />I LOVE having the bigger screen. I Love this game.
0756407125|5.0|First and foremost please excuse spelling, punctuation, and grammatical errors. My Fire,  bless its heart, tries to compensate as much as it can for them!  I do not make a habit of reviewing books. I read and then harass my friends until they do as well -when I find one worthwhile. I got a friend absolutely hooked on Kingkiller Chronicles.<br /><br />Sorry, I digress.  I have read and reread Wise Mans Fear numerous times since I picked up my reserved hardback the day it was released. While checking Kindle prices I noticed it received only four stars, was surprised, and started parusing the reviews. I noticed some complains in the negative reviews I felt compelled to address. The book has been called a hot mess, boring, lacking in character and plot development. The chandarin and scrael go virtually unaddressed. Kvothe has become a nymphomaniac. It's. Rediculous someone so poor can afford herbal birth control.<br /><br />Life is a hot mess. The only truly leniar aspect of life is we are born and we move 'forward' to death. Everything in our lives is subject to being disrupted, forgotten, or completely derailed. Kingkiller is a first person tail of the protagonists life told by the protagonist. While its retrospective from where the protagonist is in his life with the ocassional commentary, it is happening 'in real time' for the reader. We are getting the unedited or embellished sequence of events from the source. So, yes it is going to be a red hot mess. No, everything is not going to neatly line up, fall into place or go how we think it should. Real life is not like that. Understanding that, Fear is a well written, thought out red hot mess. The fact that the ways Kvothes life gets derailed makes sense, is plausable takes true mastery. So, we will learn about all the things people are griping about ( ie the Chandarin and Scrael) as Kvothe does as we move forward through the tail of his life. If you as a reader can not handle the journey through the good, bad, derailed, boring, etc that is Kvothes life go fine a third person tail with a Mary Sue character. Don't knock a masterfully crafted and told tail like Fear because you can't hack it.<br /><br />Finally, if you are one of those negative people who have to find something wrong with everything and rail at the world about it do the rest of us the curtisy of picking something logical. The concept of people suddenly becoming obsessed with fornicating due to mythological creatures is not new. Look up sucubus and incubus, saytrs and nymphs. Also, it is not uncommon for individals recently introduced to carnal pleasures to over indulge. Know any American college students you could ask about the subject? Kvothe has spent time alone in forests and is familure with medicines and herbs. Therefore it is logical he could know and be able to find and or make an herbal birth control. He would not have to buy it, rendering the 'its implausable because he's poor' argument illogical.
0385342063|4.0|This is a fun light read and if you are a fan of the author I don't think you will be disappointed.

To say more might ruin it for you - so go ahead, indulge!

0142420891|3.0|Spoilers:<br /><br />Everything in the book seemed to happen at extremes. However, I have to confess I liked the over-the-top emotionality of Adam. I also felt that the resolution was overly simplified, as some others have commented. I think that there would definitely be some lingering emotional issues for both of these characters in the relationship, but especially Adam. I don't see how things can turn around so completely for him so quickly. In summary, seems like chick-lit for teenagers. I enjoyed it, but I also feel a little dirty for doing so... :)

0062183591|5.0|Cheating is stealing.<br /><br />It's a polite social fiction for when we do something that doesn't seem that bad or dishonest.<br /><br />It's so widespread and accepted that we use it even when there's nothing bad involved - (\\"That store is always so busy during the day that I cheated and went first thing in the morning\\").<br /><br />And the way we justify it is to say that we're not cheating individuals, but more the system, or some \\"thing\\" like the IRS where cheating is widespread. Of course, in that case, you're not cheating other taxpayers, you're just cheating the IRS.<br /><br />And one of the best people to write a book about it (cheating and the IRS), is Dan Ariely. I've really enjoyed his other two books on irrational thinking, and this one doesn't disappoint. He has a knack of showing us how we ignore any signs that might make us feel uncomfortable, and we can rationalize our thinking processes, even if they are irrational. But cheating is a way of doing something clearly wrong, as opposed to sloppy decision-making.<br /><br />Dan has his usual range of test sessions. He analyzes people working under closely controlled circumstance, where cheating is next to impossible. This gives him a baseline, and it's reasonable to assume that if a similar bunch of people are allowed to work unsupervised, or can report their own scores, any increase must be due to cheating. And cheating shows up in just about every situation where it's possible. He changes his experiments to mirror real-world situations, such as having an \\"outsider\\" appear to cheat, or having a set-up similar to people working in groups at businesses.<br /><br />The inspiration for the book was a consultant for Enron (and a Grateful Dead lyricist - John Perry Barlow) who, right up until the collapse of the company, thought nothing was wrong. But when Enron went under he realized that the signs were easy to see and had been around for a long time. As Dan points out, \\"We lie to everyone - especially ourselves.\\" I've been in businesses where the company was in a precarious position, but we all fooled ourselves into pretending all was well - because we wanted to.<br /><br />Dan's sense of humor is well-evident. After admitting in his last book that there was a guy in the experiment who would come on to female subjects to affect the results of the tests, he admitted that he was that guy, and he did it \\"for the good of the experiments.\\" This time around he discovers that creative people are more likely to cheat. And he ends that chapter by saying \\"By the way, I'm not sure if I mentioned it, but I think that I am incredibly creative and highly honest.\\"<br /><br />But the high spot of the humor in this book (and there is lots of it) is when he discovers that people are noticeably more honest when they sign a notice at the top of a sheet, saying they affirm that the information they give is honest. He decided to give that information to the IRS, and there's hilarious interchange where the IRS seems disinterested in changing a form that might have netted them millions, if not billions.<br /><br />There's much much more in this book. It never drags and amazes you with the depths he plunges to get experiments that reflect everyday life. In fact, the only kind of cheating he doesn't investigate is having affairs.<br /><br />So, a great book whether you've read the other two or are just starting reading Dan's books. And he gives good credits to his research assistants, unlike many writers who just mention their name in the Acknowledgements.rselves.\\" I've been in businesses where the company was in a precarious position, but we all fooled ourselves into pretending all was well - because we wanted to.<br /><br />Dan's sense of humor is well-evident.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The product was fabulous.  Not only were the books amazing, but it actually costs less to buy the trilogy together than to buy individually. I read this of course on my Kindle Fire, it was separated just like the normal books and had each book in its own sections. I recommend this to everyone, not only did it work well on my device but it was was an incredible read.

B0079R8IYW|3.0|I like to soften-up the utilitarian appearance of my electronic devices by carrying, storing, and protecting, them in cases made from natural, or at least \\"natural-looking\\" materials instead of synthetic ones.  Also, as a dude, I don't want anything that looks flowery and I just prefer a more traditional design over something that appears neo-modern or new wave. The leather finish of the Exchange Case does meet that preference to a point. I'm also a guy that can never have enough compartments or pockets. In fact, I already had a similar Kindle Fire case made by a competitor, but that one didn't have a stand. The Marware Exchange Case has a stand which can be folded two different ways, one for vertical viewing, the other for easy typing.<br /><br />However, while the card pockets and cash slot is a really cool idea, if they're used, the case will not close very well, if at all.  The magnet that holds the top-flap in the closed position is not strong enough to keep it secure (at least not on mine which could possibly be defective). I put just one card in a pocket and a very small cleaning cloth in the cash slot and it will barely close. So I don't see how those features can be of any practical use. That said; my previous case had the same issues with its pockets.<br /><br />I'm not overly disappointed with this Kindle Fire case. The Marware case looks pretty good and I like how the stand has two different uses. Compared to how much one can pay; the Marware Exchange Case for Kindle Fire is good buy for the money.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Well done and most important to me is that this was one of the better rated Solitaire games where the permissions were the least intrusive.  This is the only game I have.  I would like certain other games but won't download because of permissions. Thx MobiltyWare for this Solitaire.<br /><br />Update 2012-11-03:  I have found that I must always shut the wi-fi off before playing this game, which I still like very much, because the extremely intrusive ads that materialize before I start a game can be distressing and annoying.  By shutting off the wi-fi, I can merely click on \\"skip\\" ad and go right back to playing.  After a number of times playing with wi-fi off, the ads and necessity to click \\"skip\\" disappear until I start the wi-fi again.  If it didn't shut off at some point, I would have deleted this game regardless of the fact that I like it.

1442337966|5.0|When I read The Secret, I was changed dramatically by its lessons and words of wisdom and connection.  I have already listened to The Power 5-cd set at least a dozen times.  Each time through there is something else that stands out and you realize another valuable perspective.  The Power holds something for everyone to gain from.  The value in the simplicity of the lessons or \\"points of power\\" is limitless.  I highly recommend this book, whether you get it on audio or text.  If you want to bring clarity and focus to what you think and the way you feel about what you think, that process alone will change everything. The Power will be a tremendous asset to you and a tool you'll want to refer to over and over again.  It is an essential addition to your library and a fantastic follow-up to the Secret.

0345803485|1.0|3 words describe this book:  1. boring 2. dirty 3. ridiculous.  I feel like a fool for falling for all the hype and picking up the book in the first place.  I haven't read such bad writing since I struggled through the first 3 chapters of Twilight, which could have been written by a not-so-bright 14 year old girl.  The writing is stunningly bad, the characters are so cliche its almost comical (a 21 yr old virginal waife with \\"eyes too big for her face\\" who doesn't own a computer???  Please),  and don't get your hopes up for a plot - there isn't one.  Even the sex is boring and cliche, not to mention stupidly improbable.  And this is NOT a romance novel, there is no romance whatsoever!! The poor character development of Christian Grey leaves him as just a controlling, perverted, cold shell of a character. The author feels the need to convince the reader that he's sexy by repeating it ad nauseam.  I'm sorry, but I'm just not buying it. There is nothing to him.  The female character is even worse.<br /><br />I read a book last week in which the main characters are actually capable of performing real acts of magic, and those people were quite a bit more human and believable than any single character in this book.<br /><br />I am stunned by the positive reviews of this book, and can only draw the conclusion that the people who like this book either never read, or never read anything of quality.  If you think the Twilight series was life-changing and you read them each 3 times, you will probably like this book.  If you scan the Pulitzer Prize or Man Booker Prize lists for your next good read (like I do) skip this one!  Even if you need an \\"easy\\" read,  look elsewhere.

0385534639|4.0|This book was very different from what I have been reading for the past few years, and I'm so glad I picked it up.  I was carried away by the end of the first chapter. The author is very talented in descriptive writing, the type that makes you feel like you've been transported to the place she describes.  I gave it only 4 stars because I felt it bogged down a little in the middle of the book, but then it did pick back up again.  Definitely one of the best books I've read this year.  Its also a book I feel comfortable recommending to my teenage daughter.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This is nice I love it its really like mario bros so that's cool I would recommend it! but if you have small hands I don't really recommend.
B005EGXTEE|5.0|I hate using clichéd terms.  I very much want to find something more imaginative sounding than \\"gripping\\" or \\"thrilling\\" or even \\"compelling\\", but either my brain isn't working properly (highly likely) or those words genuinely do it justice.  I've had trouble putting this book down, and in fact, am probably at least 1/3 of the way through the second book of the trilogy.  This book was also my first ebook experience, having read it on my kindle.  But lets get back to the book.    The Hunger Games takes place in what remains of North America, now called Panem.  Panem is divided up into the Capitol and 13 Districts.  There was an uprising in the Districts about 74 years earlier that was put down by the Capitol.  In the process of this, District 13 was completely annihilated and the rest of the Districts left to eke out their lives in service to the Capitol, whilst annually supplying a lottery-chosen boy and girl between 12 and 18 years of age to take part in the Hunger Games. These Games are required viewing by all and are designed to remind the greater population that they are subject to the Capitol, with the victor being the last \\"tribute\\" left alive.  It's a fight to the death.  The main character Katniss finds herself thrust into the Games after she volunteers to take the place of her 12 year old sister Primrose as the District 12 tribute.  And so the Games begin.    The Hunger Games presents such a bleak picture of life in Panem.  I found myself hoping from the start that they would rise up and overthrow the Capitol.  So many people in the Districts are left to starve to death under the horribly sadistic government, that just surviving ordinary life is no mean feat.  The story is told in first person present tense, which took me a little getting used to, having never read a book in this tense before.  I think it adds to the pacing of the book though.    Collins apparently came up with the premise of the book while watching the television one night and channel surfing between reality shows where young people were competing for money and stories of actual war, where young people were fighting each other to the death.  Whilst it is set in a very bleak world, I really enjoyed this book.  In fact, I found myself getting quite emotionally invested in it and feeling a genuinely concerned about whether I could handle the stress of the story when reading the second book. That's got to be saying something about the skill of the writer, if you find yourself that involved in their literary world!  I  give it an 8 out of 10.    Review first appearing at [...]
0061726834|4.0|'Delirium' is my first dystopian novel in so long. I'm not a fan of the dystopian genre and except for this series I don't see myself picking up a dystopian book anytime soon (well, except if it somehow wins me over like 'Delirium' astonishingly did). I read Oliver's 'Before I Fall' and just like 'Delirium' it's one of those books you'll either really like or really dislike. I really liked 'Before I Fall' and naturally wanted to read more books by Oliver.<br /><br />Firstly, I have to address that most negative reviews of 'Delirium' seem to surround the speed of the story (slow.) I can see that, I was past the 100th page before finding that things started to happen. But that didn't mean it was a drag until then. I enjoyed Oliver's raw, poetic, and descriptive writing style.<br /><br />I wasn't sure about the storyline - that love is a disease that humans need to be cured of - in a way it's simple, but most of all, it's such a challenge to actually be convinced of it. That the book started off with Lena's evaluation helped me get in the right state of mind. The society Lena lives in is clinical and cruel and it comes across.<br /><br />Lena was brainwashed, and I'm sure that's how Oliver intended for her to be. She religiously believed in everything the government had succeeded programming into the community - it's all she knows and have ever known.<br /><br />I didn't like the voice of Lena - even when she was happy and in love, she thought she'd been infected; it bothered me she would still view her and Alex's relationship as the outcome of an illness. She wasn't strong, she didn't stand as her own person. I wonder how the story would've turned out having the protagonist be more adventurous and risky to begin with.<br /><br />I loved Alex, Hana, and even Grace - as in genuinely cared for them. Alex and Hana were good; too good for Lena. Maybe that's unfair to state but considering the amount of trouble they were willing to go through for her, I couldn't help but feel this way. Certain moments with the three taking risks for her really touched me, even brought tears to my eyes.<br /><br />I can't put my finger on exactly why I like this book. It's well-written. Oliver has the ability to write about something you're not supposed to agree with, character you're not necessarily supposed to like, and still make an impact. 'Delirium' is a lonely, trapped, and unsafe journey - and that's how I felt when reading it.<br /><br />The end should've been heartbreaking or devastasting, but I just found it awfully unfair. I was even a little mad at Lena, I felt she'd been lucky rather than deserving. It was just unfair, probably not the best note to leave off on but enough to have me purchase the second installment, 'Pandemonium'.<br /><br />Will I read the sequel? Yes<br />Will I read more from the author? Yesree taking risks for her really touched me, even brought tears to my eyes.    I can't put my finger on exactly why I like this book. It's well-written.

B005JABSB6|5.0|I purchased several of these glasses from Amazon for a few reasons.  Number one is the price.  The price I paid for each of them were very competitive with most companies and even when shipping and handling was included it made it worth while to purchase through Amazon.  Love the product.  I have children ranging in ages from 10 to 15 and thanks to the extra nose pieces (small) which are included , we were able to accommodate everyone in the family.  They were also very easy to charge and each comes with a soft bag case.  Great value and easy to use.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|In this final book of the Hunger Games trilogy, the Mockingjay has become the symbol of  rebellion.  I am so glad my friend lend me both Catching Fire and Mockingjay together or I'll be left hanging.<br /><br />People of Panem are now at war against the Capitol.  After the events of Catching Fire Katniss wants to personally kill President Snow.  Peeta is now mentally unstable.  District 13 actually existed and was not totally annihilated.<br /><br />  Some people don't like some of the final events.  But this is war.  Katniss will also have her feelings for both Peeta and Gale resolved.  I don't want to spoil the last book by writing any more.
B003YUC9JI|2.0|Yeah, I know it's called showBUSINESS, but there's taking liberties with a license (Scorpion King 3, those multiple American Pie spin-offs) but this pushes it too far. This is NOT the Karate Kid, it's the Kung-Fu Kid, and it was made because Will Smith pulled some strings behind the scenes to force his untalented offspring into the movie business, he even attempts to rap over the end credits (with Justin Beiber!). Did Daddy Smith not learn enough from his own attempts at hip-hop?<br /><br />The story lifts wholesale from Robert Mark Kamen's 1984 screenplay, only it transplants the action from California to China. Baby Smith is Dre, who is bullied at his new school. Maintenance man Mr. Han (Jackie Chan, the only good thing about this movie) teaches him Kung-Fu and forces him into a tournament to face his arch rival bully.<br /><br />Baby Smith is just way too small and young for this role (I do realize that Ralph Macchio was in his 20s when he was the Karate Kid, but Daniel-san was a stronger character and he wasn't only in the movie because his dad is Wa-Wa-Wicky-Wicky Will Smith). This unwanted movie is an example of nepotism at its worst.<br /><br />The movie itself is very drab-looking with lots of grey, muted colors and dull environments. Director Harald Zwart (double Oscar-winner for Agent Cody Banks 2 and Pink Panther 2) uses a safe, pedestrian approach to keep the movie bloodless and inoffensive. Any parent who took their children to see this really should have just stayed at home and put on the 1984 movie. Even the 1994 sequel The Next Karate Kid was better than this shameless exercise in money-making.<br /><br />The Blu Ray looks and sound good with a 2.40:1 1080p picture and a DTS HD-MA soundtrack. There are extras, but I honestly could not care less about them.
B003O86FMW|4.0|The second book in the trilogy started  right where The Hunger Games ends.  A friend lend me her hardbound copy and when I started the book,  there was no stopping me from finishing it.  Katniss and Peeta are now back home in District 12 at the Victors Village.  Their win gave the people of Panem the courage to defy the capitol.  Now there is more unrest and rebellion.  President Snow is not happy with Katniss and will do anything to gain back his control over Panem.<br /><br />The idea of reading a book about kids killing kids is not appealing to some people.  But that is not all there is to this trilogy.  The twists and turns of events, the stories of the lives of the main characters are so captivating, you will not want to stop reading until you finish the whole trilogy.<br /><br />Catching Fire ends leaving you on the edge.  If you decide to read this, make sure you have the Mockingjay within your reach.
0345803485|1.0|Right now I am really mad at everyone who has been hyping this book for no earthly reason and at myself for giving into the peer pressure and reading it to see what all the fuss was about. It's not about anything people! The sex is only mildly more \\"shocking\\" than a typical romance novel and the writing is abominable, even by the more loose standards of the genre. And I say this as someone who likes well-written romance novels. If I hadn't agreed to review the book for podcast I wouldn't have been able to finish. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.
B006Z7Z3S6|4.0|By Jim Clark, publisher, Lee County Courier, Tupelo, MS<br /><br />The Innkeepers is not a typical horror film, and I've got to believe that's the reason it's got a 76% rating at Rotten Tomatoes.<br />Two employees, Claire (Sara Paxton) and Luke (Pat Healy) remain at the Yankee Pedlar Inn. The quaint hotel has fallen on hard times and is about to close. The two spend their remaining time making fun of any last minute guests and work to uncover proof that the old inn is haunted.<br />The ghost is Madeline O'Malley. The story is supposedly true. Philadelphian businessman Thaddeus O'Malley courted her, and they were soon wed. The Yankee Pedlar was to be the location of their honeymoon.<br />Just after the wedding, Thaddeus got word that there was a problem with the sale of a coal mine in upstate Pennsylvania and that he must come immediately. He sends Madeline, alone, ahead of him to The Yankee Pedlar. There's an accident at the mine which claims Thaddeus' life. He didn't change his will, so Madeline would go from rich to penniless. She hung herself. Thus a haunted inn where Madeline roams the halls, plays the piano, etc.<br />What makes The Innkeepers different, is there is little gore. It lumbers along telling the story while introducing the two other guests, Leanne Rease-Jones (Kelly McGillis) a television has-been turned psychic, and an old man (George Riddle) who says he's come back to stay in the room where he and his late wife celebrated their honeymoon.<br />Slow moving but worth a look.

B007549W62|4.0|By Jim Clark, publisher, Lee County Courier, Tupelo, MS<br /><br />It's the end of the world as we know it ... World War III and we've been hit by a nuclear attack.<br />Eight residents of New York City clammer into the basement of their appartment building. The appartment superintendent seals the solid metal door. Our survivers are Eva and her boyfriend Sam, Josh and his brother Adrien, Josh's friend Bobby, Marilyn and her daughter Wendi, Devlin and Mickey.<br />The basement, besides being Mickey's residence, is a bomb shelter. Mickey has canned goods put back, mainly beans. The bathroom is like an old fashioned out-house and instructions are given to scoop lime through the hold after use.<br />In The Divide we feel like our survivors are within the three or four miles of the blast and therefore would suffer from radiation poisoning if they stepped outside.<br />After several days, the shelter's door is broken from the outside and armed soldiers in biohazard suits enter. We're not privy to why but they take Marilyn's daughter. The rest of the survivors are able to kill two of the men and get a machine gun.<br />More days pass. It's decided someone should go outside, wearing the untorn biohazard suit, to see how bad it is and to see if they can find the girl. They pick Josh, figuring he would come back because of his brother.<br />Josh finds tunnels attached to the basement entrance, a lab, with several children sedated in containment units. He's recognized, so rushes back to the cellar losing the machine gun.<br />The Divide is not for the faint of heart - they must chop up the dead, drop them in the outhouse and dust with lime.<br />It's probably a fairly realistic picture of humanity lost.

B007LPSLO4|4.0|Okay, so if you are living under a rock and unfamiliar with this trilogy, I'll give you a little background.  Fifty Shades of Grey started out as Twilight fan fiction--very naughty Twilight fan fiction.  As the author developed and revised, the characters became much more than Edward & Bella and the story became something completely different.  The result is that even though there are no vampires and a heck of a lot more \\"adult\\" behavior, the adult fans of Twilight are getting their knickers in a twist over these books.  :)<br /><br />Okay, history lesson over. The truth is, when I heard that an indie published, BDSM erotic romance series scored a $5 million movie deal--I had to see what the fuss was about.<br /><br />You can see the echo of Edward & Bella in Christian & Ana, but C&A were much more developed and (for the most part) realistic.  Christian was the more interesting of the two by far.  His psychological issues were fascinating.  He could be ruthless and controlling one minute and completely vulnerable the next, but it was done is such a realistic and believable way.  Watching him grow and evolve throughout the three books was a joy.<br /><br />Ana was stronger and more likable than Bella, but I had a few issues with her character.  First, she starts off as a 21 year old virgin who is completely innocent and within a very short time, she is begging to be trussed up and spanked.  It was too radical of a shift, too quickly.  Secondly, Ana kept talking about her \\"inner goddess\\" and her \\"subconscious self\\" like separate personalities inside her.  Not only was in incredibly annoying, but each time the author mentioned these, it pulled out of the story.<br /><br />Another thing that was a little off was the dialog.  The author is British, so there was a tendency for some of the characters to use words or terms that didn't fit people born and raised in the U.S.  The result was I kept reading them with British accents in my head.<br /><br />But even these couple of issues didn't ruin the story for me.  I really did enjoy reading these books.  There is action, danger, suspense, lots and lots of sex and a total escape into a fantasy world that we will never live in.  And in the end, isn't that what reading is all about?<br /><br />Overall, I give the Fifty Shades Trilogy...<br /><br />Plot - 3 1/2 bookmarks<br />Character development - 4 1/2 bookmarks (Absolutely loved Christian.  There is a scene in book two where he just slayed me!)<br />Love story - 4 bookmarks<br />Sex scenes - 4 bookmarks (For the most part, they added to the story)<br />Dream cast (otherwise known as who I pictured while reading) - I don't think it's possible to read these books without picturing Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart as Christian and Ana.  I just saw the Cosmopolis movie trailer with Rob and his character is totally Christian.  I'd die a happy woman if they could cast him in the Fifty Shades movies.  Actually, all the characters were sort of echoes of who they were in Twilight, just older and more mature.  Anna Kendrick (Kate), Kellan Lutz (Elliot), Ashley Green (Mia), etc.of issues didn't ruin the story for me.  I really did enjoy reading these books.

0718157834|5.0|Ok, I'm not the blubbering type and did not need a box of tissues to read this book but this does not mean I didn't love enjoy every single part of it.  Have never read Jojo Moyes but stumbled across a brilliant review and thought might give it a go.  It didn't take me very long at all to like both Louisa and Will and frankly, as I made my way through the book, I too fell in love with their characters.  Couldn't read it all in one sitting (I have kids!) but in between reads, desparately wanted to get back to my book.  It's a lovely story, every character is human and real, the story entirely believable and the ending is as it should be.  And now that I've finished the book, I wish I hadn't!  Already I miss the characters!

B0067RQYNW|3.0|This is third word based app I have tried since buying my ASUS transformer at the end of last year. This is the best so far but still has problems I don't know how to fix. The lag between typing and text appearing whether using the tablet or the keyboard is ridiculous. I have had to slow down my typing speed and even then the end of the sentence is usually garbled and I have to re-write. I have found out the hard way that time limited information supplied by email attachment in either gmail or outlook either does not open or when does open is completely blank. Often when in the middle of something the document crashes - especially true when filling in a form recently and I had to give up. There is no way to tell which page you are on in a document or to edit the document to include page numbers (and searches online can only find enthusiastic endorsements, not fixes). Is there anybody out there who writes thousands of words a day for their living and uses ASUS Transformer? If yes then please let me know an app that is usable for creating and editing really long documents in Android. (I don't actually believe a lot of the reviews I have read since my attempts to use this have been so unsuccessful).

B0006AAS5G|1.0|I must say I was not very pleased with the looks of this one when I opened the box. I instantly thought it was a fake.<br />I've read a lot of positive reviews on this one and loved the way it looked by the photos I've seen of it. Apparently I've only seen old photos of it..<br />The lovely texture on the dial's face gives it an expensive look, so based on this, and the positive reviews, I purchased this one from Amazon UK.<br />So I was very disappointed to see how different this one looks in reality, the dial's face is quite different than how it's presented in the photos here on Amazon (both .com and .co.uk), if you give it a close look.<br />The dial's face looks in reality like a plastic sticker has been put on it, and the nice texture is almost not visible. If I finally get the \\"right\\" lighting on it, so I can barely see the hint of texture on it, it just enchances the \\"plastic look\\" of the dial`s face. The rest of the watch, the case and the bracelet, looks and feels solid though, and it definately has some weight to it.<br />I googled a bit to see if this was a fake I have recieved..<br />What I found is that Invicta apparently made some changes to this watch, as photos I've seen in other forums of recent date (from 2011), looks like mine, and that photos earlier than 2010-2011 has the more \\"authentic\\"/ expensive and solid look that I expected.<br />If you look close to it, you'll see that the new version (2011?) has not the very visible texture (and actually less visible in reality), the markers at 3, 6 and 9 o'clock is missing, the circles of the chronograph is at a bit more distance from each other, this does not look good at all in my opinion and gives it a less authentic look, and the frame around the date is more rounded.<br />I could live with the changes of the markers, and date frame, but absolutely not with the plastic look and absence of the visible texture on the dial`s face. After all, in my opinion it is the nice look of the texture combined with the more centered chronograph circles that adds the solid and expensive look to it and made me buy this one.<br />So the photos Amazon present of this watch, as of today, (they'll probably and should change it soon), they show the old and nicer looking version.<br />So beware of that.<br />If you don't mind about this, this is probably a good watch. I will never know as I'm returning it..<br />(Thanks Amazon for great customer service)!<br /><br />You can take a look here: http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/product-gallery/B0006AAS5G/ref=cm_ciu_pdp_images_0?ie=UTF8&index=0<br />Pay attention to the markers at 3, 6 and 9 o'clock, then you'll be able to see which one is the new or old version.<br />You should then be able to see the distinctive differences between them and see that the old version is much nicer looking..<br />BUT, as I haven´t seen the \\"older\\" version in person, I really wouldn´t know if it really does look better in reality or has the same plastic look as the newer version, but based on all the great reviews (and photos) of the old version, my guess is that the old version really does look better.<br />Please feel free to comment on this if you happens to have both the old and new one and could provide a comparison.<br /><br />Invicta should also have named their model different after the changes so that it's possible to find out about the differences before one buy it..<br />Most websites and sellers presents the old version photos of it, unfortunately.<br /><br />So reviews of recent date saying like \\"it looks even better in person\\" and so on, I just don´t get.. Rolex lookalike? Are you joking? Yes, the OLDER version could probably pass (again, based on photos I´ve seen, and where it was compared next to a Rolex), but absolutely NOT this new one..<br /><br />I rated it 2 star on .co.uk but I have changed my mind now and therefor gives it only 1 as my first reaction was that I thought it was fake.<br />But I would probably have loved itif it had met my expectations.
1577314808|5.0|I'm almost through with the book (audio version), and while Eckhart's teachings do raise many questions, it offers some positive things to the reader. This is not unlike any spiritual teacher. The choice you make is whether to understand the essence of his teachings. If you do make the choice to read the book, and if you haven't read the great spiritual texts, it will offer you a greatly new perspective on life. IMO, its beauty lies in its simplicity. Several negative comments have focused on how ET sounds extremely authoritative and almost disdainful in his delivery in the audio version. If you don't sound sure about what you are saying, most people won't want to understand/accept what you are saying. This is true of any person in any profession. Would you rather go to a doctor who sounds sure of his/her diagnosis or one who tells you that he is going to try 5 different treatments on you in sequence to see which one works best? Right now, I choose to accept what ET distills for me from the great spiritual texts.

B00756GKBA|2.0|I've been a Madonna fan ever since her debut, but after her last effort 'Hard Candy' she just seems....hard. And jaded. And lacking in innocence. Is seems disingenuous of her to suggest the title of this new album (and it's inclusion in the song 'Addicted') is not a reference to the drug MDMA when it so obviously is. And the lyric 'I'm a sinner, I like it that way' along with the catchy-but-hateful song 'Gang Bang' only leave me feeling sad about the space she appears to inhabit these days. As is often the case, Madonna offers up a few good songs here on an otherwise C-minus album. 'Some Girls' auto-tunes her voice to its most generic sound. And the 'B-Day Song' (on the 'deluxe' album) is annoying as heck - pure filler. I was left feeling, \\"That's it?\\"

It'd be nice if they'd add the ability to move the app to external memory for those of us who don't have a lot of internal memory on our phone and don't wish to root.
B004JN1D2I|3.0|The Game of Thrones series is GREAT. I have no complaints about the actual content of the series, as I have found it absolutely riveting and a page-\\"clicker\\".<br /><br />That said, I do not recommend getting the bundle for the Kindle. I had not realized it, but all four books are crammed into a single Kindle file, meaning it is even harder than normal to tell how far into a book you are. This is frustrating, particularly when it comes to maps or wanting to go back and re-read something for clarity. Kindle is not necessarily reader friendly anyway when it comes to going back to read something. 4000 pages crammed into one file makes that pretty much impossible.<br /><br />Sure, you can use the table of contents to go to a particular chapter, but then you have to know which chapter corresponds with which; the chapter headings within the book are by name, not by number.<br /><br />So, even though you save money by having all the Kindle files in one, it can be difficult to navigate through, and with as many characters Martin has in his books, being able to go through and re-read is kinda necessary at times.<br /><br />So, five stars for the actual content of the series. I'm so very riveted that I have read through all of these within a couple of weeks. But two stars for the difficulty of four books in one.

I mean, Fifty Shades came around awfully fast for being, well, Fifty Shades of F***ed up!  But, that being said, I still LOVED the books.  Great writing.  I haven't enjoyed a book as much in quite some time.  Steamy, touching, funny ... this book has it all.  I hope EL James writes more from Christian's point of view. I loved the \\"Meet Fifty Shades\\" section at the end \\"Freed\\" ... Would love to see more of that.  Highly recommend!
B0000C3I6U|5.0|If you are working out and you are looking for something to make you want to go to the gym, watch this movie.  It is well worth the price, especially if you like AANOLD.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved this book (the entire trilogy!).  It's been quite awhile since I've been kept up half the night by a book :). I loved the characters; the story of Ana and Christian.  What a great love story!  I knew immediately that Christian had fallen in love with Ana...before it was \\"revealed\\".  I thought the story line was great, the writing fantastic, and the sex ... well, that was great, too!  Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not in S&M, but, WOW ... that's all I can say.  The book was also laugh out loud funny, which I thought was awesome!  I finished all three books in a matter of days.  Was up until 3:00 am reading!  Loved that EL James ended the trilogy with a little insight into Christian with his point of view upon meeting Ana.  I hope she writes more in the series from Christian's point of view. Excellent ... would highly recommend!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I have not gone to the movie but wanted to read it before I was influenced.The book was completely consuming.From the beginning of selecting the tributes to the hunger games to the interference of the President Snow after winning the games,and on into the revolt the book held my complete interest.I recommend this for everyone to read.
B0071MQBX0|5.0|I've seen Phantom in the Theatre 3 times and of course the movie but I think that this performance is the best I've seen yet. I think that this Christine and Phantom were the best yet and the extra 25th Anniversary stuff at the end of the performance was a nice touch. It was nice to see Crawford and Brightman back together though not singing with each other. Though the 4 Phantom's at the end singing were terrific too. This DVD is definitely worth it and at least for me, much better then the movie.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I try not to read reviews before i read a book, and that was a mistake with this book because it is about abuse and BDSM. I wasn't happy at all that I paid 10 dollars for a book about abuse. I'm not trying to knock the sexual lifestyle of other people, what they do behind closed doors is their own business. What ticked me off about this book (and I did finish it, though had to skim some stuff, but I knew I'd review) is the fact that she doesn't want to be spanked, beaten, or terrorized. She wants him to love her, because she's so attracted to him, and she thinks she'll change him. Her excuse is that if she deals with the beatings that she doesn't like nor want, then maybe he'll love her. He gives her little pieces of himself, by actually holding her as she's sobbing herself to sleep because she's so humiliated and in pain from the major spanking he did on her. She thinks that's sweet. Maybe had he not spanked her in the first place when she didn't want him to, she wouldn't have been sobbing herself to the point she was ill. She makes a comment to him in an email and he threatens to beat her, then she begs him to not be mad at her. She timidly walks in his door, afraid he may be upset. She's terrified of the beatings, but waits it out, hoping he'll change and love her. He won't let her touch him, he takes what he wants.<br /><br />The thing that bothers me the most about this book is it sends the wrong message. It's telling women its okay to be beaten by a man if you really love him, because there's a chance you can get him to change. he gives her just enough that all the romantics out there buy into this scenario. I can't believe this is number one, it blows me away.<br /><br />I want to stress again that I'm not dissing anyone's sexual preferences. If she was into the spankings, and tying up, that would be another matter, but she's not. She's terrified of it. The author justifies this by having her \\"inner goddace\\" speak out and be excited to go into his red room of pain, though she's making herself ill she's so terrified.<br /><br />This book should come with a WARNING, I'm beyond ticked it didn't. If my 17 year old daughter stumbled upon it, I'd be furious. Obviously I wouldn't recommend this book.<br /><br />Addition: Its been a couple days since I finished this and a day since I reviewed, and something else I've found is that every time I run across stuff about how amazing this book is, I get angry. I've never ever had that reaction over a book. But even days later, I can't shake this book. It's the fact that she's being abused and people are okay with it. I never say Don't read a book, in my reviews, but beware that this stuff sticks in your head, and is emotionally upsetting, and won't leave you because people are singing it's praises, making abuse seem okay, sexy even.pain, though she's making herself ill she's so terrified.<br /><br />This book should come with a WARNING, I'm beyond ticked it didn't.

B0058VW36U|5.0|I love it so much I just want to play it all day and night untill I fall asleep everyday
B007CKNX28|4.0|This album is a solid effort and py favorite three track combo is 4, 5, and 6.<br /><br />For those buying in cd format and listening in it you will be rewarded with sonics that push the capabilities of the cd format where resolution is concerned.  Show the potential mastery of the artist in my eyes
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Its really cool. Lots of Games, some harder than others. Great for those who have fun with challenges. I love it. Later.
B006RUJST6|5.0|This book was awesome.  I loved the slammed poetry and the romance and the friendships and how close everyone was great read one of my favs for the year.
1433502410|5.0|One of my friends recommended me to buy this study bible. It is really wonderful. The content is so amazing, and also the print is very nice! I guess this is the best book I have, and also the very important book for my life. Thanks those authors of this book! Praise the LORD!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love this game I got about a week or two ago and ive played it nonstop since then I am addicted!!&iexcl;!!!!!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|The games are minds fun; simple but addicting.  Some controls could be tweaked a bit, but overall it's not that bad.  Like that you play to unlock games, although the cost in tokens is a little steep. All in all, a good app for the price.
B005EGXTEE|3.0|I have read the book and seen the movie both interesting but also lacking that sence that something bad is going to happen to the characture that authors like john marsden capture and make you want to stay up late in bed just to find out what happens next. It was also a bit violate for me but it was an interseting read
0312641893|5.0|I loved this highly creative re-telling of a fairytale!  The characters were endearing, the plot well paced, and the writing complex and interesting.  I can't wait for the sequels to be written!  After reading a lot of entertaining yet forgettable books, this is the first that has become a favorite since the Hunger Games and Harry Potter.<br /><br />Note:  I saw that you can read the first five chapters for free either here on Amazon or on your Kindle.  Try it out! :)
B00634GHJA|5.0|easy to use and convenient for getting pics home when not near home and you can't email the videos/ pics.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is a lot of fun and addicting. awesome game. ice age is a great movie and this game is a lot of fun.
0062082353|1.0|I honestly found this book alarming. The constant reference to \\"savages\\" from the first page. His boasting of the number of \\"kills\\" is disgusting. The writer comes across as a red neck small minded clueless bigot. He doesn't seem to understand that the people he was killing had their country invaded based on a BS pack of lies - yet he can't understand why they want to fight a foreign invader? Really, if our country was in the same situation theirs is would he not take up arms.<br /><br />At one point he writes, \\"I told the Army colonel, \\"I don't shoot people with Korans--I'd like to, but I don't\\". This is just vile.<br /><br />I really had the impression that Navy Seals were the cream of the crop, intelligent as well as the bravest of the brave. This clown makes them seem like a bunch of high school quarter back frat boys who love hurting people from bar fights to literally killing for the sake of killing.<br /><br />I also agree with the many other reviewers in that this guy just seems to blow his own trumpet constantly throughout the book.
1594202842|5.0|many people who are giving this a bad review probably havent finished reading the whole book or are extremely sensitive bad parents who are furious because their kids suck at life. Not all kids are special so dont be offeneded. I wish my parents were as motivating as this author and as I am having a child this gave me a great perspective<br /><br />Now to the book review.<br /><br />It was fascinating how Chua wrote this memoir.  I can feel the emotion pour through the words used to describe the moments of parent child drama.  Well worth the read!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game is like a Mario for the Kindle Fire. It's great quality and a ton of fun. Definitely a must download.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Very good app fun to play!!! will give u hours of a good time!!!hope they come out with another game soon!!!!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|Very fun game.  I enjoy it very much.  Try it..... you'll get hooked.  I guarantee it!  It will keep you busy.
B0063IH60K|4.0|My favorite game is now being played on the Kindle Fire and I am thoroughly enjoying it!  The only small issue is zero scoring at times when cards are played on card stacks on the right...but are scored when played on the left.  I'm not bothered enough to rate the game below a four.
B005EZJ3MW|5.0|Hello,today I am acting very formal.lol i mean ...........anyways.<br />I love this soundtrack because these songs get to me there very powerful.like the song skyscraper,\\"like a sky scraper as the smoke clears I awaken and untangle you from me would it make you feel better to watch me while I bleed\\" you see its SOOOOO powerful. I love Demi cause she's full of GIRLpower. GO GIRLS!!!!! TTYLXOX
B005CA4SJW|5.0|This isn't your average sci-fi zombie apocalypse to start off. It's realistic and has a great story line. It doesn't have phony weapons and they're not always prepared like in the movies. It does have awesome make-up and special effects, story line, suspense and very good actors! This season will keep you on the edge of your seat! A must buy for zombie lovers!
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I really enjoyed The Hunger Games books one and two... could not wait to read book three.  Now I almost wish I had stopped at the second book.  Book three totally fizzled and left me with a bad taste in my mouth.  Very dissapointed. Would have gave just one star but gave an extra for the fact I enjoyed the first two books so much.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|First off... real money is not needed!! You can purchase items, but it is not necessary to play the game. Design your own restaurant&hellip;have fun with it! I play it every night. Very addicting.

B007V2UGPE|4.0|well made game. I have a newfound respect and admiration for most CGI and this is very impressive for a game that could potentially have several dozens of units at once.
B005C6HGSG|5.0|I can SO imagine Jim Beaver reading this book aloud (ya idjits!). It's just a fun read. Lots of background lore, too, which is just what you'd imagine Bobby providing.<br />To be honest, I haven't finished the book yet--but even if it falls apart in the final quarter, I'll still feel I more than got my money's worth.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|the game itself is a lot of fun.  can expand pretty fast and lots of cool things to add.  my one concern on the Kindle Fire is that I don't see the parental controls to add a password or something else to prevent my 4 year old from accidentally purchasing stuff.<br /><br />Before I get the &quot;don't let your kid use it. its not a toy.&quot; let me add that one of the reasons I got the Fire was because of all the great interactive books and apps for kids.  In Color I might add.  We love to read them together or use the apps together.<br /><br />All that being said if anyone knows where the setting are (and they are not under &quot;settings&quot; on my Fire version of the game) I would truly appreciate a reply.<br /><br />did I already mention what a great little game it is? :)<br /><br />4 Stars until I can figure out how to make it &quot;toddler safe&quot;
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I'm not sure why other people complain about the hints. It is a little harder because most of the hints and the map only show up after you have discovered a clue or new area. I thought the game was beautiful and entertaining. If you really want or need to cheat just look the game up on the Internet. You can find anything on the Internet. I didn't mind having to think or backtrack. It all started to look familiar the more I got lost. I loved this game!&quot;
0307939693|1.0|The book may be a bestseller, but I could not get past the 2nd. disc in this VERY expensive audio version.  The story is narrated in American English.  The dialog ia conducted in very heavily Asian accented English, which after a few tracks becomes a very annoying distraction. It is sometimes difficult to understand. I wish this detail had been posted in the description.  If this is not a feature of the written work, why did someone decide it would make a good feature for the CD? I purchased the audio version of this book to listen to on a long distance driving trip.  What a waste. So, do not bother with the CD.  The cost of the set is outrageous to start with and the narration quelched any desire I may have had to read this bestseller.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|another great game from glu mobile. freemium but so far it doesn't seem like one where you have to buy coins to get into it. but only time will tell when you'll uninstall this one
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Excellent read, a prime example of what our Military is all about, the unsefishness and their willingness to make this a better world while sacrificing their family life and security for US, GOD BLESS CHRIS KYLE and every member of the armed forces
386521584X|3.0|Loving photography, studying it in university, winning some awards in photo contests & working as a freelance photojournalist; I've heard much about this supposedly seminal photography book.  I never saw it when it was first published, because I was a very young child.  Later, after I became a huge fan of Kerouac's oeuvre; I also heard about his legendary introduction to these photos.  For many years, I have meant to get this book.  I have perused selections from it, in magazines & elsewhere; but have never held the book between my hands.<br />Finally I held this book in my hands.  Kerouac's five-page introduction is indeed fantastic!  It's a true representative sample of his stream of consciousness, grammatically challenged, writing style.  I loved this short sample of his work.  However, his opinion of these photos is much more generous than mine.<br />These are all black & white photos.  There is no text, except for a few descriptive words.  We are given no technical information as to how these photos were taken or reproduced.  The year each photo was taken is not even mentioned.  Most of these photos seem unposed.  Were they?  I'm not thrilled with the quality of these photos.  Many have too much shadow.  Many just seem so drab.  Kerouac's writing seems so uplifting.  These photos don't mirror his enthusiasm.<br />I thought this was supposed to be one of THE greatest of photography books.  Sorry, but I don't see it.
0345803485|1.0|I usually finish books I start, especially if I've bought them.  But this was bad. I read about half, read the last page and decided I'd never buy 2 more of these books and won't finish this one.  Not at all sexy and what kind of woman would agree to this treatment?  Not one I want to read about. I'm really annoyed I wasted my money.  Wish I knew how the author turned garbage into cash.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I have to say - I'm shaking my head a bit at some of these reviews.  I read the 3 books in a short amount of time also, because Christian and Anna were very interesting characters and the author really wrote them to pull you from book 1, to 2 to 3.  There was just such a draw to find out what happens next.  Yes, they both got on my nerves from time to time, but that's what makes a good book - you start to develope a vested interest in the main characters. Which brings me back to some of the other reviews - PEOPLE, this is fiction, these are NOT real people - don't take it so seriously.  This trilogy was written for adults to enjoy a little wishful thinking and a journey into fantasyland.  This isn't a true life story.  And please let's just get off the Twilight reference.  I've never read or seen any of the books/movies, and I'm guessing I'm not the only one, so the comparison is lost. I truly enjoyed the look into 2014, the happy ending and the fact that they were still enjoying their kinky f**ery, even though they were happily married with 1 1/2 children. I guess the playroom did make it to the \\"big house\\". I just found these 3 books a very enjoyable \\"calgon\\" moment - it just \\"took me away\\" (reference for all the over 50 year olds :-).<br /><br />The only real problem I had that held me back from 5 stars was that I wanted to know more about the side characters, his parents, Elliot, Mia.  His relationship with Taylor and Jane, that was more than just employer/employee and why Christian was so messed up even after growing up in what appeared to be a nurturing family.  There were references made like chopper vs helicopter, Lelliot and a brief glimps into their home life.  There could have been more development on that end.
B0033KR5XY|5.0|This is a whole lot of Bach organ music. If you are reading this, you know that. I have only listened to about half of the CDs - it will take me awhile to finish - but I can say for sure that Preston is wonderful at Bach. I've heard some of these pieces done by local organists and loved them, but hearing Preston play them reveals the vast gap between organists who are very good - and work hard - and an organist (Preston) who is brilliant - and works hard at it as a full-time job. The tempos are rock solid and the fluidity - wonderful. Bach was an organ virtuoso and it takes a virtuoso to properly play this music: Preston is certainly one. He tours, so if he is playing near you - go hear him!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I always intended on reading the bible, and even would bring it with me to work. I would maybe get through geniuses and that would be it for my effort. Now I'm ahead of my &quot;read the bible in a year&quot; schedule thanks to this app. Great app worth every.........oh wait it was free.
B0055SWM08|5.0|A Very fun game. It is definitely worth 99 cents. The graphics and the score fits perfectly with the game.
B004UXUX7S|5.0|I went to see this film in a theatre, on the big screen. I also saw The Artist on the same day. I don't know what the Academy was thinking. Although this film received the Oscar for Best Screenplay, it was robbed of Best Director, Best Actor and Best Film. This movie follows the book very closely, at times, word for word. It is skillfully directed, and blended into what is easily George Clooney's finest performance of his career. The cinematography is crisp and has great lighting, unlike other films that are too light or overly dark. Having the story take place in Hawaii helps too.<br /><br />The scenery is fresh and tells the story with unique twists. The performances of all the main characters is first rate. It is a contemporary film of the present day so language can be explicit and it is geared for adult audiences, not for young children. There has been enough written about the plot from the book. The film does alter certain aspects of the novel, but it is skillfully accomplished without damaging the overall theme. The Blu-ray delivers a crisp and clear product, you will be pleased with the visual energy. You may want to bring a hanky, it touches the emotions on several different levels. Shailene Woodley and Amara Miller, who play Clooney's daughters turn in some top-notch performances. The character of Sid is also noteworthy.<br /><br />See the movie when everyone is asleep or at least turn off the cell phone. This movie is the must-see of 2012.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|greatness a game for all ages lots of fun to play<br />. . . . . . . . . .

B0055SWM08|5.0|Like no other game I have played. Each level is different. Speed is not a factor.  A real thinking game and help if you need it.

B007PT3QOQ|5.0|tons of fun and addictive!!!!<br />when I downloaded it I expected the game I played in elementary school,  its not but its still a great game.
1250004217|3.0|I agree with most of the other reviewers that the story was an important one to be told.  I did not know anything about the round-up of French jews by the French police during the war.  I liked the back and forth in time of the telling of the story, but found Julia's character to be a little melodramatic about the whole thing.  Yes, it was a horrible time in France's history and the world's, for that matter, but her complete over-the top obsessive investment in this was somewhat unbelievable.  It was certainly a heartbreaking story and I believe for most people would be a little disturbing, but more likely interesting (it was 60 years ago and we can't change history)to find out that the apartment you were moving into had been \\"confiscated\\" because the Jewish family who lived in it 60 years ago were sent to the concentration camps and that a small child had accidentally died there, but, really?  Julia's reaction and obsession was unbelievable and the writing was first year creative writing.  People really just don't talk like that or get that melodramatic about something that happened 60 years ago that they had nothing to do with.  The holocaust, the people who perished because of it, the people who perpetrated it and the people who survived should never be forgotten.  It was mankind's darkest hour.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I wish there were more games to start. I don't like the fact that u have to pay coins for everything.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|some people say dh2 was better. I don't know. I play apps that are free and I find some pretty good ones. this downloaded smoothly on my kindle fire even though it was a long download cuz its gameloft and its a great game. you can choose from four different classes for your character and there's a wide variety of levels getting harder as it goes. the graphics are wonderfully and there's no lag. if you have played dungeon deffenders and liked it you will love this game.
B003R4ZMJU|3.0|I bought this for a gift for my girlfriend. Great buy for people that love this show. Came fast and great buy.
B005KTZ05G|5.0|i was just amazed about everything when i first saw this figure. it has very nice detail and it will basically go into any pose you would like. When i got it though, the right hidden blade broke immediately. It was not a big deal i actually just put some super glue on it and now it is better than ever. I highly recomend this figure but i also recommend to put a lot of super glue on the skinny parts of both the hidden blades. in the long run it will just make having this figure more enjoyable.
B0070UFMOW|5.0|This is one nice device and is definitely an improvement over the E7 and is more refined than the E11. I don't think it's appropriate to try and compare this product to the E9 or E10. I started with an E6. I enjoyed the amplified sound, but I hated the battery life. The E7 was an obvious improvement in battery life, but it was surprisingly lacking in the power category so I started looking to upgrade. I've had the E11 for about 2 months and didn't like the overwhelming bass and distorted levels in the EQ. It's hard to explain, but the E11 just didn't sound right to me and I could never find the right leveling for my type of music (mostly Nu Jazz, with a little R&B, Hip Hop, and soft Rock). The DAC function does what it is designed to do (helps fine tune lossy radio files).<br /><br />Quality = 9; FiiO did a nice job with this headphone amp. There's some kind of brushed metal surface going on here that is solid and can take some drops. Unlike previous models you will not have to worry about finger smudges. I'm a little puzzled as to why the LCD screen is smaller than the E7 model. I'm also a little disappointed that the battery life (claimed 15 hours) is less than the 80 hours for the E7.<br /><br />Sound = 10; As I stated the E17 is an improvement over the E7 in every way (minus battery life) and is more refined than the E11. I consider myself an audiophile so the addition of a true EQ with treble, bass, and balance control is very beneficial in finding the right amplified sound. Where the E11 in my opinion focused too much on overall power and bass, the E17 hits the spot just right with decent highs, unbelievable mids, and just the right amount of lows. The power is on par with the E11, but some reviewers will notice that it's not as loud by a small margin. I come across poorly converted audio all the time and the E17 makes those files come to life via the PC DAC function.<br /><br />Price = 8; Audiophiles will pay just about any price for the right sound, but other potential buyers may be hesitant for a device that's roughly twice the price of the E7. I've also noticed that the price of the E17 fluctuates often so you may have to be patient if you're looking for a deal.<br /><br />Please note: My audio setup is Klipsch Image One headphones, iPod Classic 5th gen., and FiiO L9 LOD. I set the power level to 12 dB with the volume in the 40's. You must select the appropriate input on the E17 to get sound. That seems obvious, but it took me awhile to figure that out.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|A real page turner.  I couldn't put it down! Books 2 and 3 were not as exciting as book one but still worth the read.
B003UESJ9M|5.0|the dvd was in very good shape plus the movie if you have not seen it you need to its a very good movie.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Spirited Away is one of the best children's movies out there. Other reviewers have compared the film to other great animated children's films such as Pinocchio and Snow White, but I would argue that Spirited Away blows away the competition. Yes, it can be slightly scary and intense, and it deals with maturity and coming of age, but these themes really only scratch the surface of what Spirited Away has to offer the viewer.<br /><br />Firstly, every single major character (with the exception, perhaps, of Chihiro's parents) is extremely dynamic. Characters develop, change, and fall victim to mood swings, propriety and other personality-modifying factors. This both makes Spirited Away unique and realistic. In the real world there isn't a black-and-white picture of good and evil, and Spirited Away makes sure to challenge the viewer's first impression of every character. Seemingly evil or mean characters turn out to be less heartless than they initially seemed. Such character development shows the viewer that there are different perspectives on each issue.<br /><br />Spirited Away also deals with important themes/lessons, especially for children. I won't get into the specifics, but time and time again, the characters learn that love and friendship are far more valuable than material goods. Additionally, one theme of the film is environmental conservation/ending pollution--as evidenced by the cleansing of the river spirit as well as Haku's story. This is just a sampling of some of the important themes in Spirited Away.<br /><br />Finally, Spirited Away does, like other children's films, ultimately present a coming of age story. Chihiro learns the importance of standing and speaking up for herself. She also realizes both her privilege and the value of her identity.<br /><br />I would recommend this film for ALL children age 7+; it's at that age that you can really start to appreciate everything it has to offer. Please don't deprive your child of this wonderful movie, and, as an adult, don't deprive yourself either. I'm grown and I can appreciate it on SO many levels.
B0063IH60K|4.0|great free app. needs to be more challenging deals but for free can't complain.  maybe some deck options like different backs on the cards.
0345803485|5.0|First, I am a 35 year old woman who DOES NOT like to read.  Not many books catch my attention enough to get past the first chapter.  This is one of fewer than 5 books in my life that I am completely enthralled with.  There is a deep, emotional pull with this book.  As each page turns beneath my fingers I am sucked in deeper and find myself wanting more.  I don't want this series/story to end!!
B005HP2JAM|5.0|I live in North Carolina and I took a trip to NYC to see this film. Why? Aside from the obvious (3D is better in theaters, and it wasn't playing in my hometown, and I'm a dork), I went because:<br /><br />1) Listening to Herzog's interviews about the film got me excited. It's clear that he intensively researched this subject. For him this wasn't just a neat little history lesson about some quaint cave paintings; he was fascinated and in awe at the beauty of these paintings, and like any good art appreciation, he wanted to understand the context around which they were created. He wanted to understand and empathize with the painters' values, fears, and struggles. He went out of his way (to the point of obsession?) to understand these things.<br /><br />2) This was Herzog's most ambitious project since Fitzcarraldo (and there may be no more ambitious project than that one). It was an incredible technical challenge to do this film. Because the cave is a hazard to humans (toxic gasses) and because humans are a hazard to the cave (toxic gasses), Herzog could take only a very small crew into the cave and for only a very brief time. To do 3D filming under these circumstances was a remarkable challenge requiring militaristic-like planning.<br /><br />3) I love Herzog's films. This film is essentially art appreciation, but knowing Herzog, I knew this would be a work of art itself. Most non-Herzog documentaries either want to inform you or persuade you: they deal in a medium of facts or arguments. Herzog, on the other hand, deals in a medium of metaphor, sound, and imagery. Rather than trying to tell you everything there is to know about the cave and its painters, he just wants to move you. He wants you to see/hear/feel why this matters. And he knows that words are instruments far too blunt for that task. He culls his words to the bare minimum; there are often 5+ minute stretches where there are no words at all.<br /><br />---<br /><br />I walked into the theater at the corner of a busy Manhattan block. When I walked out 90 minutes later, everything looked a little different. It was still the same busy Manhattan block, but now somehow it looked slower, more interesting, more incredible. I had the dizzying feeling of having just been psychospiritually rocked.<br /><br />Writing about this makes me near-desperate to see it again. I loved it. I put it right there with Encounters at the End of the World as my favorite Herzog doc. But Herzog docs are made to be seen in theaters. As badly as I want to see it again, I just can't do it. I have too much respect for Herzog to do it.of a busy Manhattan block. When I walked out 90 minutes later, everything looked a little different.

B005CGI4EG|5.0|These DVD's are great. I have loved the Bundy's for a long time and I can't believe I have waited this long to get this series. What a great price for the entire 11 year series of the Bundy's. Cable TV is so lame these days, now I just pop in a Bundy's and it cheers me up.

B006OOHYIC|5.0|this is a great game and a great thinking game for all ages. it is a little tough at times on certain levels
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I started using this on my kindle for personal use and have expanded it to my use as a teacher.  I have it on my kindle fire, my personal hp, and my school mac. It's a great way to sync all of my notes and a great way to go paperless.

B005UT29Z0|3.0|Stanley Tucci is SO good in this. It's a shame he isn't in it more. Kevin Spacey is terrific, and Jeremy Irons and Demi Moore performed well with what they were given.<br /><br />I don't know why Penn Badgley was in this movie. For as much screen time as he had, he looked perpetually lost - and not in a good way. Zachary Quinto was just okay. Though he's the same guy who plays Spock, I had a hard time believing that he could be a rocket scientist here. I spent more time admiring his hair than his performance. Paul Bettany was surprisingly good, I thought. He had an interesting monologue toward the end, and I thought he nailed it.<br /><br />I love the idea of this movie. I should've been blown away by the sheer gravitas of the acting talent involved. Unfortunately, the performances only served to elevate the thinly written story.<br /><br />Margin Call succeeds as a topical, mature, and well-made film - Oliver Stone wishes he could say as much for Wall Street 2. But for a film dealing with such an engrossing subject, I felt like Mr. Chandor didn't get much mileage out of it. He caught himself a good-sized fish - but the bigger ones are still out there, eluding the reach of his net.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Great game. Play is engauging and much more complex than it appears. A few levels so far are very surprising.
B00783NWB6|5.0|Watched the 3D Bluray its has one of the best effects very similar to Resident Evil 3D, the overall depth & the night(dark) shots are very clear,(not many pop outs) the 7.1 DTS-HD sound is also excellent the movie is as usual horror/action type, I personally enjoyed the movie very much particularly because of the fantastic 3d video & awesome 7.1 audio.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|great game.. fun for all ages and the whole family. graphics are great; and like your in the movie. bane fun and enjoy.  plus its free!!

B007R41E8O|4.0|A great challenge with great graphics. I have a hard time putting the game down. There is enough of a challenge to keep you interested.
0439023513|4.0|I'm glad I'm not the only one who felt very sad and unsatisfied about how Mockingjay ended.  It was emotionally hard to read the majority of the book because of all the details about the violent deaths and brutal treatment the main charactors suffered. I wish that S. Collins was more elaborate about how Katniss and Peeta's relationship was renewed & somewhat restored at the end of the book, including a description of their feelings for each other. I just want to know if Peeta's love for Katniss was still just as strong for her at the end of the book, Mockingjay, as it was during the first Hunger games. I think it would give me closure. Collins spent time and detail on examples of how strongly Peeta loved Katniss, even during times of great trial & stressful moments in the previous 2 books. I think Mockingjay could've used 1 more chapter on Peeta/Katniss's relationship.
B001KQEE0U|5.0|2Pac was a Lyrical Genius, with a grand style, and much talent.<br />I saw the FEW 1 star rater-haters and started laughing at their criticisms and non-sense,<br />First thing, most of the 1 star reviews were written by cowards that hide their identity as \\"Customer\\". or they are all done by 1 Coward posting multiple reviews.<br />If you can't be MAN enough to put your name over your review, then your review holds NO basis.<br /><br />My review of this album is 5 star. my favorite song is \\"Life Goes On\\" ..... wow what a great song and performance. and though there are many other songs on the album that deserve praise, I just let them speak for themselves.<br /><br />RIP 2Pac.. I'll pour 1 out for ya.
0439023521|5.0|This is a great book.  I read it on my Kindle and was glad I was able to make the print larger, because I finished it in two nights.  The story line was superb.  The characters were very real and came to life as I was reading them.  It's a love story--as no other I have read or recall reading.  It's gruesome in parts and soft and sad in others.  Makes you wonder if our heroine will ever be happy in such a future world. And what an imagination the author has with the ability to write about it.  I haven't seen the movie, but I think I will read the next two books, before seeing the movie.
B0045XKJBI|5.0|Great movie!  No problems with downloading or viewing! I would use Amazon Prime again to watch movies.  Ed is totally hot!
B0012E6R3W|5.0|Where do I start how about the fact that I'm kicking myself for not checking these guys out sooner, I'd always heard the name through high school but never strayed past Metallica which given the state of my apathy towards them I wish I would have left them behind and delved into the other bay area thrashers. Anyways I happend upon that metal evolution documentary in specific the thrash episode, Watching it as well as the other episodes I realized I was not as much a metalhead as I previously thought. So I went to the ole Music store and found a used copy of this album so I snagged it brought it home and popped it in, Let me tell you I don't remember the last time I heard something that had me air guitaring while simultaneously head banging right off the bat and all the way through. Now on to my actual review this bad doggy has 11 tracks the 1st one being an instrumental intro but leads seemlessls striaght into riff central, Everyone of the riffs on this album is solid the drums are awesome and the vocals are harsh (In A Good Way). Lyrically Theres nothing award winning but are well enough written so as to not render it unlistenable like some thrash bands out, Reguardless, for my first taste of this band it was completely satisfing and will ensure my further purchases of more of there catalouge. So in summation if you feel like your metal heart is about to flatline pick this up and give it a nice dose of adrenaline.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|What a creative story line! Due to it being a \\"young adult\\" book, it was a very fast read. This book and the rest of the trilogy grabs you from the get go and is highly entertaining, even for not so young adults.
0345803485|4.0|I'm reading the first installment of this series, as suggested by a friend. I'm at about chapter 13, and I have thoroughly enjoyed the dialogue between the characters. However, the narration is hard to get through. The narration is in the 1st person and in the immediate present tense, which can come across a little confusing and just doesn't sound/read right. But, over all, I'm enjoying the story very much. I like Ana and Christian. I will continue this series until the end, and then post an over-all review. Great job E.L. James. Keep developing your writing, and don't worry so much about the bad reviews. Lots of people love your books.:)<br />~April J., Louisiana
B0054JZC6E|5.0|the fame is really fun but the points are dealt hard to get aftef a while but the game is dealt fun and all my friends like
140053271X|5.0|This Nook came extremely fast - I was so excited.  I demolished my first Nook, so I was ready to reload all the wonderful novels and start reading. Thanks for the great customer service!
6305657947|5.0|I remember seeing the original movie back at the movie theater so I couldn't wait to see this release.  Well, this one is even better than the original in my estimation.  The story centers around a very, very rich man who - out of boredom - decides to commit a theft.  An insurance investigator (Rene Russo) gets assigned to this case and winds up falling in love with the guy (like you didn't see that coming....).  For those who have seen the original, this version has some twists-and-turns and an unusual ending.  The tone that this movie wants to imbibe is one of sophistication, smartness, coolness, jazzy, and hip.  The music is just SO perfect and what a fabulous soundtrack it is.  Rene Russo's wardrobe is possibly the best reason to see this movie.  Designed by Michael Kors, the clothes reek of being rich, classy, and sophisticated.  Pierce Brosnan is also a sight for sore eyes.  The two of them have wonderful chemistry and the locale of New York City adds to the tone of the film.  I loved it!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|If you haven't read the series, get it now.  The story is a very unusual one, but the author sure makes it flow flawlessly and in a very engaging way.  I could not put the book down and have re-read them 3 times already.<br />Highly recommend it, unless you are not comfortable with graphic and intense intimate scenes.  The book could not do without them, as it is what the relationship is partially about.  If you are okay, you will be glad to read them.  ;-)
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app.  The best one out there.  Helps me study the word in a interesting way.  You can decide how much or little you want to read, just do something  to increase your walk with God  everyday.  This is a must have for me.  Highly recommend.

B0017SWPXY|5.0|I am not an animal lover, but definitely did a re-think in a positive way.  Couldn't get it out of my mind. \\"The Art Of Racing\\" really hit a homerun.  It made so much sense, furthermore, lessons could be used in everyday living.
0545265355|5.0|My kids loved the books.  Some violent story lines so you decide if they are age appropriate.  I was okay with my 4th and 6th grader reading them so to each his own.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|While reading \\"Fifty Shades\\", kept hoping for a great plot, never got it.  If one is looking for a porno-read, this is your book. I understand there will be sequels, I won't buy.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|it got stuck on wave 13 idk must be a bug otherwise a fun game! hope to be able to play it soon as its fixed
B007V2UGPE|4.0|Standard Glu sidescroller.  Didn't think I'd like the gameplay at first, standard attack is automatic, but once you get further in the game it helps.  One thing I like is that unlike other glu titles I've played, this one is not completely impossible without purchasing upgrades, it gets really difficult when you get into double digits, but it is possible to earn enough in game to survive.  At least so far....
B007SYWFRM|5.0|ice and fire<br />I love this because its funny lol and its fun because I rate it a 1000000000 lol
B0077PBPJ6|4.0|I watched this miniseries and then bought the book and read it. I found the whole story a powerful exploration of love and war. I have one question though, does anyone know if this is the version that aired on BBC? Honestly, I want to buy it, but the PBS version cut some stuff out and I want the original version.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|This app works great!! You can choose what color you want and the level of brightness. Although the Kindle Fire has no LED light, the white colored light works just as well and lights up the room.
B0042J6VUS|4.0|This tripod works good with my iphone 4.<br /><br />You can move it around but its not tall enough.<br /><br />Other than that, its a good buy for the price ;-)
B005VT42BS|5.0|I had been looking for a tool that would just scan my network and give me  all of the  MAC addresses.  This app does it in spades!  It is a whole tool kit with all of my favorite network utilities in one place.  Highly recommended.
B005SDMDRW|3.0|The download only had 75% of the book so didnt get to read the end so was a little unhappy
B007SYWFRM|3.0|this game is a touch buggy.  very cool graphics though.  going to visit friends is where it gets buggy.  if you didn't have to do that it would be a 5 star game. played this on kindle fire.
B0028RXXE8|5.0|I own it and have given it to others but try to wait until a really good sale. If you don't have, get it, oh you will enjoy.
B004DI7HZ6|1.0|This book was picked for our book club.  I wasn't excited about the pick and shouldn't have wasted the $10.  I read about 75 pages and just couldn't get into it.  There are 10 people in our book club and the only person who liked it was the person who picked it!
B00514HDNW|5.0|It was a great book. I read a lot and I was getting tired of reading all this monotonous stories. I could not put the book down. It was eerie,exciting and intense for such a short story. I LOVE this book.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Several kids in children's church use it on the Kindle Fires.  They follow along with the lesson and enjoy their Bibles.
B005GYGCOI|5.0|Maybe I'm more forgiving than others but I recognize the Kindle format doesn't allow me to do as much as I'd like with ebooks. It's one reason why I like reading some ebooks via my Kindle app on my ipad as I find I get some add'l functionality than I would have with my second generation Kindle...that preamble aside, this has some great features that I haven't seen in other ebooks: love the map/text linking -- so, I click on a point of interest on a map and it takes me straight to the review. That's cool and much easier  than constant bookmarking. And the Notes features is a BIG PLUS--adding my Notes of things I want to see and do and referring back to them while traveling was great and made the on-the-road travel work really well.<br /><br />The content was what I would expect from Lonely Planet: Excellent, as always. I bought another brand guidebook (in print, not ebook) and the Lonely Planet ebook won hands down. I don't' know why I would ever travel with a physical book again as this was spot on what I needed when I was in India.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|There are things to like about this book - the story telling from the perspective of someone in law was outstanding and gave you a real flavor of what this scenario would look like in the real world - but the story drags a bit and left me wanting more.  It had great potential but was a bit anti-climatic.  And while I appreciated the twist at the end, I just found it completely unrealistic and unbelievable.  Sorry, but as a mom, I just can't see that happening. This is my first book by this author - I would probably look at other books by him but would be hesitant about purchasing.
B005KJJ4F8|3.0|I'm going to mirror a lot of what has been said, but I don't think I take as harsh a view as some.  I have read horrible books before.  Books that were painful to read.  Books that I didn't even finish.  \\"Cinder\\" was not as bad as those books.<br /><br />That having been said, I will point out that it has some issues.<br /><br />1. As is stated in many reviews, the plot is ridiculously simple to figure out.  I'm not sure I was even a quarter of the way through the book before I knew exactly where this story was going.<br />2. Because of the ridiculously obvious plot, when nearing the end of the book, that's where it starts to get a bit painful.  I wanted to literally yell at the screen (as I was reading the Kindle version) for the characters to hurry up and get on with it all.  I knew what was going to happen, so it seemed to take forever to get there.<br />3. The characters were fine.  In my opinion not as static as some would say, but not as in depth as they could have been.  I was almost hoping that since the plot was so obvious right off from the beginning, that maybe there was some hidden plot that would allow these characters to grow in a way I had not yet foreseen.  Alas, I was wrong.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the book as a whole does not match up to the very interesting premise set forth by the author.  It was very middle of the road.  Not horrible, but not that great either.  That's why I gave it 3 stars.  (If I could have I would have split the rating right down the middle at a 2.5, honestly.)<br /><br />All in all, I might recommend this book if:<br />1. You can borrow it.  Don't spend any money.<br />2. You aren't looking for a really in depth, compelling story; perhaps just a fun, easy read.<br /><br />This one needs to stick with the younger readers.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is so fun. I really like the movie clips. I like how you build the family so cutel!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|cool I really really like all this games keep doing a good job cool cool. cool good job I am having fun with all this gamed
B002VECMAE|5.0|I've talked to friends who didn't care for this, but I think it's one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time. I'm a big fan of George Clooney and I've seen the range of his talents many times...he's another Denzel Washington or Morgan Freeman in my book...but this is hilarious. And all the very famous supporting actors were great also....especially Kevin Spacey... and the narrator, Mr. Jedi himself, is, as always, unbelievably great and believable. Excellent value...
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game brings me back to when I was a kid I love it!  Leps world is like classic Mario but with a twist because you get to shoot things with certain items you collect.  I am new to apps and this was super easy to learn how to play
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|Products was just as ordered. Grateful for the quick delivery. The movies was loved by family of all ages. The beginning is a little sad so we do skip some of it.
B000ID37KO|5.0|My girls were throughly enthralled with this movie. They sat unmoving with the exception of the suspenseful musical buildup of the attack scenes. We all totally enjoyed this old classic. Who knew that my teen girls would sit so till during an old classic!!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|It is cool although a lot of adds pop up when I try to open the game. I thought it was really fun over all.
B005OLF6BI|4.0|cd received in good condition, considering distance it had travelled, was advertised as a live act in nz, im too old to travel to hear her , so the cd will do. good cd . listen to it every week por so
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I took my kid to see the movie and thought the concept was good.  I checked the books out from the library for him and then read them after he was done.<br /><br />Katniss wasn't all that likable or memorable.  But her supporting cast in the book were fantastic.<br /><br />I recommend this ready for mature 11-12 year olds, and for 13 and up.  Its a good book to read with your kids and talk about the subject with them.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|very similar game play just more simple compared to its famous Nintendo counterpart. Great graphics and for the most part, great game play as well. I experienced a few minor glitching of the characters but nothing terrible.<br /><br />I love this game! Found a leprechaun to be a bit random but overall I really like this app
B007J4T2G8|3.0|The book was a little lame but oh so addicting.  I thought about these two characters alot when I wasn't reading the book and really found myself caring about them. I really wanted him to find happiness with her.  I ended up reading all 3 novels with in one week.<br /><br />The books are long, filled with moments that maybe should of been edited out, and they span only a few months.<br /><br />I recommend this as a light quick, kinky and somewhat sad read.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved all three books. Book two was my favorite. The first one excited me, the second one kept me wanting more and book three added the sweetness to everything prior. The author may have repeated certain words but i thought they were great!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book, kept me on the edge of my seat. Looking forward to seeing the movie to see if it lives up to the book!  Go ahead and purchase the trilogy, you will want to read all 3!!!!
B007N5YIUS|5.0|I haven't had this much fun playing any game....ever! It's amazing the tricks you can do....even when you miss.  I love it!
B0064NTZJO|5.0|Drive is one of those movies that sneaks up on you, but it does so quickly.  Before you know it you sincerely care about the characters who, in the classic cinema style, draw you into their world with subtle actions and quirks that express the emotions they have broiling under the surface.<br /><br />Not enough good can be said about Ryan Gosling's performance as an individual whose life really contains nothing of value, until he meets the 'girl next door', and her beautiful, innocent son.<br /><br />What follows is not a romance exactly, but a growing exposure of the vulnerability of both characters.  Gosling's character is not driven by money, fame or lust, just the feeling of comfort he experiences around the first individual in the film who does not seek to exploit him.<br /><br />Gosling is a master of his craft, conveying through subtle expressions the torrent of emotion his character feels.  Carey Mulligan is equally astonishing, playing the role of a woman torn between someone who brings a sliver of light into her dreary existence, and the father of her son.<br /><br />Heck, everyone involved in the film from Oscar Issac, who takes what could have been a character we should have hated, and infuses him with a desperate charm, to Albert Brooks, the reluctant criminal, forced to deal with a rapidly escalating situation, makes this film a delight for anyone with a serious interest in movies.<br /><br />As stated in other reviews, this is either a film you love or hate, but my opinion is that those who value unparalleled acting and a tight, moving story will love this!
0985114606|5.0|If you fell in love with Christian & Ana in Fifty Shades, you're going to fall in love with Gideon and Eva's story. Easy read, HOT HOT HOT sex and great story line. Any fans of Fifity Shades need to read this new series!! I can't wait for the next one!!

B007PT3QOQ|5.0|cool game<br /> cool game though I wish there was a better or faster way to get energy rather than waiting on time to pass or to pay cash for a free game.
B005LAIGLO|5.0|Considering the fact that there are not many reviews about this movie yet, I was surprised that there have been no 5 stars yet. Now I am a picky person and have watched my share of movies so very rarely will I give a movie a 5 star unless it grabs me and I am on the edge of my seat. This one grabbed my attention from start to finish.  It reminds me a lot of the Italian Job.  Just when you think you know what is going on in the movie, it slaps you in the face and takes you in a different direction.  The movie kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time and part of liking a movie is how the movie ends.  Some movies are great all the way through until the ending.  Some end the way it should, while some end in the way it shouldn't.  I thought this ending fit well and I was pleased.  So my advice to you, is if you like Italian  Job you will like this.  It's just hard for me to understand why someone would give this movie anything less than a 4 star.
B006DHASYM|5.0|This is a feel good predictable romantic comedy.  Even though it follows the typical rom-com plot lines the characters and actors bring some life to it.  I found it to be a nice and fun movie to enjoy.

B003ZSJ212|5.0|I have the set I was abit leery after reading some of the revievs that have been posted. Bought the set watched... All of the movies amd I can honestly say they are the best out. Now would I like to have a set that has to orginal unaltered movies yes. P.S all the negatives are written mostly before the release date!!! Watch then review wine on a blog somewhere.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I've been typing letters of recommendation a lot lately as deadlines for the upcoming award season is just down the road.<br /><br />I have 5 different office Suite and to be honest this and Quick Office Pro are the only ones I use.<br /><br />If you have access to an update word processing Ste like MS Office or Corel WordPerfect, then you'll love this.<br /><br />From creating documents to spreadsheets or open picture files, this is a handy suite to have.  And, although I'd rate this equal to Quick Office, it is FAR superior to everything else out there including Kingsoft Office (with its tacky powder puff blue interface, what were they thinking anyway?).<br /><br />As with any office Suite or art program, the bigger the screen, the better and you should have a good stylus to boot.<br /><br />If you read or need to respond to word or Excel files that come as attachments to an email, then you'll definitely need a suite like this.<br /><br />OfficeSuite Pro 6---- 5 stars.
1440503257|2.0|Obviously, the pitch of this book to Harry Potter fans will account for the majority of its sales. Having said that, I have a lot of questions about this book.<br />1. The early ad copy about this book, including some on Amazon, includes the term \\"Muggles,\\" yet the edition I have in hand avoids that word on the cover.<br />2. The relationship to the Rowling franchise is almost null. In the descriptions of the recipes, the book mentions what part of the Harry Potter series features the foods. That seems fair enough. However, the legal matter and the front cover explicitly state that this book has no official, sanctioned association with the Harry Potter franchise. I just wonder how far someone can go in saying that a product is an \\"unofficial Harry Potter\\" item, riding on Rowling's coattails, and profit from the good will she has earned with her creation.<br />3. This cookbook has no illustrations of the foods, which would be helpful for the younger people likely to tackle these recipes.<br />4. Some of these recipes are embarrassingly basic. There is a recipe for french fries that essentially says to cut potatoes into french fry shapes and boil those pieces in oil. Another recipe explains how to boil oatmeal.<br /><br />I am just not certain about the value of the book. It includes some useful trivia, it explains, briefly, how some foods indicate cultural differences between Brits and Americans, and it offers a faithful documentation of when these foods appear in the books. It might inspire some younger people to learn to cook. And, frankly, it made me pay attention to what a key role eating plays in the Potter novels.<br /><br />It nevertheless offers a suggestion of incompleteness. One wonders just why some deal could not have been or had not been reached so that this book would have had a more complete presentation. However, even the list of acknowledgments, with its thirty-plus recipients of the author's appreciation, omits Rowling, whose work provides the foundation for this uneven publication.ation for this uneven publication.
1619492911|5.0|For those who have read F. Scott Fitzgerald's famous 1931 short story \\"Babylon Revisited,\\" this 1922 novel reads like a prequel, detailing the descent of a couple too beautiful for their own good. It's a mesmerizing, brilliantly written book that still leaves a mark.<br /><br />The Pagan Harleman introduction to my excellent Barnes & Noble edition notes \\"The Beautiful And Damned\\" is \\"Fitzgerald's least-known novel,\\" but it could also be his most intrinsic. Fitzgerald will, and should, always be known as the man who wrote \\"The Great Gatsby,\\" but this lines up more with what we think of when we think of him, of rich and bright young people throwing their lives away in search of elusive pleasures and verities.<br /><br />\\"Things are sweeter when they're lost,\\" observes the novel's main protagonist, Anthony Patch. \\"I know - because once I wanted something and got it. It was the only thing I ever wanted badly, Dot. And when I got it it turned to dust in my hands.\\"<br /><br />Patch is speaking here of the novel's other main character, his partner in dissolution, Gloria. If his first novel, \\"This Side Of Paradise,\\" serves as F. Scott Fitzgerald's literary introduction, \\"Beautiful And Damned\\" is when he unveiled the other half of his legacy, Zelda. As he writes of Gloria Gilbert, he might have written for Zelda Fitzgerald, \\"whose radiant fire and freshness was the living material of which the dead beauty of books was made.\\"<br /><br />Gloria doesn't exactly line up with the former Miss Sayre; at one point in the novel she brags about not reading books whereas Zelda was quite a literary-minded person. But as a Southern belle of decided caprice and high temper, Gloria clearly is based on Scott's then-new bride to a great degree, and that knowledge adds to the experience of reading this book. How did the bedroom conversations go while Zelda read this over his shoulder?<br /><br />Not too terribly, I think. Gloria is presented as a bit of a headcase and the butt of some comedy in the book's earlier, lightest third. As the novel develops, however, our sympathies move from Anthony to her. She's stronger, and despite her words, more reliable in action. Her worst fault may be in sticking with Anthony as long as she does.<br /><br />Anthony is the novel's problematic center, a shiftless layabout at the mercy of whatever wind catches him, content to await the inheritance of his grandfather's Midas-like legacy. Fitzgerald's great achievement here, other than his constant amazing flows of descriptive prose and his deft shifts from comedy to tragedy, is his ability to keep us sympathetic to Anthony despite his many failings. His plight is fully self-made, yet you feel for him like you might a moth at a candle.<br /><br />Are there flaws here? Yes, but they work in the context of the novel. Minor storylines regarding such things as the religious leanings of Gloria's mother disappear unresolved, while others like the interest in Gloria of a moviemaker mutate strangely into relative dead ends. These feel less like missteps while you are reading, though, and more like the rushing flow of life one experiences when young. Fitzgerald's racial and social biases are on stark display at times, but they reflect the thinking of his characters and the narrowness of their world, and so work, too.<br /><br />Most amazing to me was that Fitzgerald was only 25 and at the height of his fortune when he wrote this mature and prescient tale of trouble ahead. It's a fine companion to \\"Babylon Revisited\\" that way, too; a worried look forward rather than a wan look back.in the book's earlier, lightest third.

B004A8EI9M|1.0|How is this thing getting so many good reviews? - It's basically a predictable and uninteresting extended version of Resident Evil, just without any of the fun high tech stuff. Running around the southern countryside randomly stumbling into zombies....really? Plus you know exactly whats gonna happen, no surprise, no anything. The characters are soo forgettable, bland without any deep personality...was actually rooting for the zombies to eat them to put this mediocre series out of its misery - ugh, so bad, CSPAN is more exciting....STAY AWAY!!
B0034G4P80|4.0|I don't like super heroes/comic book characters movies but I was surprised that I actually thought Thor was decent.Chris Hemsworth is perfect as Thor.He is so charming in this movie.I think I liked it because it had to do with mythology and Thor was a God so it was a little different than your typical super hero movies.I thought the actor that played Loki was good also.I thought it had some funny scenes wich I liked because it wasn't serious the whole time.I liked the parts when he was on earth better than the Asgard scenes so I didn't like the first 35 minutes or so of the movie that much until he landed on earth and then the movie really picked up.I now am looking forward to seeing part 2 when it comes out.I recommend seeing this movie even if your not a fan of comic book/super hero movies,like me.You just might enjoy it.
0385344228|4.0|This book definitely left me shocked. There were both good and bad with the book. I love the fact that Landay has the background in law so he knows what he is talking about, there fore it makes the story more realistic for the reader. I was shocked when Ben gets killed and the leading lawyers own son is found in the mix of the murder. With out giving anything away for those who have not read yet I would say this whole part of the book was definitely shocking and left me not knowing how I felt about jacob. There were some down falls for me. I felt that we didn't hear enough about Ben and Jacob, why did Ben hate Jacob so much? I would have liked to have seen more from the character Jacob, he never gave the reader anything. In the end I felt I made my final decision on Jacob, but still felt he should have been more developed through out the story. I would have liked to know how he was feeling through out the story. The ending was definitely a shocker and left me asking myself how I would handle this situation if I had a child and was in the position this family was in? Crazy story and definitely would recommend reading this book! I couldn't put it down and I am definitely looking forward to reading more books written by Landay.
0345803485|1.0|I normally like romance, chick lit, and racy stuff but I found Fifty Shades of Grey to be too unbelievable - even for fiction. This uber successful, smoking hot, powerful executive falls for a clumsy, plain looking, 20-something year old virgin who doesn't even seem to have an understanding of basic business etiquette; really? Then flash forward to the same 20 something virgin considering a BDSM contract that includes anal fisting? I just found it laughable. I tried to roll with it, but instead found myself rolling my eyes numerous times throughout the book.<br /><br />I was disappointed with how the first book ended and felt like it was too lengthy for the little amount that had actually developed between the two main characters. There was a lot of he's so beautiful moments and internal waffling from the main character about whether or not she was going to participate in the BDSM activities. I also found the main character's desire for a serious relationship with the male character annoying - he was extremely direct about the fact that he was looking for a sexual relationship (a contract is about as impersonal as you can get!), and yet the female character was wanting more. I feel perpetuating this fairy tale of being able to \\"tame\\" a man really does a disservice to women and makes them think it is okay to stick in relationships with unavailable and damaged men who have no desire or capacity to be in a loving relationship.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was skeptical about reading this book because I never got into those types of books (twilight, Harry potter,etc) that are aimed at teens but are enjoyed by many adults. However, this book was terrific. I could not put it down and read it on my phone every time I had a free moment. Absolute page turner and would recommend 100%.
B007O6R1MI|5.0|I am not a huge Cas Fan but LOVE the show and well am a Sam Girl so this episode was fantastic.  **spoiler**  I loved the fact that they showed what Sam was going through and although Cas took away Sam's main story-line in that in absorbed his \\"craziness\\" I really enjoyed that the episode was mostly focused on Jared rather than completely taken over by Misha.  Don't get me wrong Misha's a great actor but I watch the show for Sam and Dean and was happy about every portion of the episode, I thought it was done very VERY well.

B006XF5BTG|5.0|I have been involved in bodybuilding since the 50s.  I have trained with weights consecutively since the late 60s. I have had the pleasure of training with someone who won the Mr. America contest in the early 70s.  I have tried everything from multi-hour, multi-day workouts, workouts found in the \\"muscle\\" magazines and probably everything that has come down the pike.  Some of the best gains I ever made was on a program written by Perry Rader, the founder of \\"Ironman\\" magazine.  He proposed a workout regimen he called \\"The Perry Rader Squat System.\\"  The workout was 5 compound exercises based around 20 rep \\"breathing squats.\\"  Perry Rader used to say, if you want big arms, do squats.  Although I made great gains, it just didn't intuitively make sense to me that less could possibly more.  With that in mind, and watching others at the gym, I reverted to years of excessive, non-gain producing workouts.<br /><br />Interestingly, I re-examined the \\"less is more\\" approach around the age of 60 and went back to working each body part only once a week utilizing only compound exercises.  Amazingly, I started not only making gains in size but strength and actually got to the point that I was lifting weights equivalent to the weight I was utilizing in my 30s!  I'm always interested in adding to my voluminous body building library and recently purchased this book.  Mr. Matthews, the author, has obviously broken the code regarding the methodology to make progress.  His approach is a total approach with a thorough discussion of proper nutrition, mental attitude, and most importantly, a bodybuilding regimen that will actually work for you.  Interestingly, I have watch many alleged personal trainers in action at various gyms.  Many seemingly don't have a clue and I think often complicate workout routines seemingly to justify their usual rather high fees for their alleged services.<br /><br />Successful bodybuilding need not, as a matter of fact is not a complicated thing.  If you follow the nutritional and workout regimens outlined in this book and you do not make gains, I would suggest checking your heartbeat in that you might no longer be with us!<br /><br />I have been on the same routine for years and part of my motivation for purchasing this book was that I was seeking something new.  I have already laid out my new routine from the suggestions in this book and I eagerly anticipate utilizing this well thought out and conceived work out plan.

B001QWBM62|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo1X1X70SVR3993]]Excellent audio makes for great video and that's why I bought the H4n. In my video review, I will show you the H4n in action as I use it to record the sound of a steam train among other things. I wanted to record my own sound effects on location as well as have another option for dialog. (Many DSLR videographers are using the H4n for this purpose because the onboard sound of a DSLR isn't the best.) There are too many features to list here, many of them are described on the Amazon page. However, I can say for my purposes, the H4n is exceeding all expectations.<br /><br />First and foremost, let me say the user manual is EXCELLENT. The manual contains step-by-step instructions complete with images of the menu screen so you can use the H4n with confidence. There are also real-world examples of how you will use it, each one detailed with diagrams and CLEARLY written instructions. Take a few minutes to look over the manual and you'll get the most out of the recorder. (You'll see a few pages of the manual in my video that is part of this review.)<br /><br />A few key things that were important for me:<br />Recording to SD cards is economical and the formats supported are compatible with all my software, including Final Cut Pro X.<br />WAV and MP3 files in various resolutions give lots of options as to the quality of the recording.<br />Powered XLR ports enable me to use my XLR mics (two at a time) to record an interview that can be synched to my camera's footage.<br />Built-in limiters allow for the recording of loud machinery without blowing out, something I do frequently.<br />The built-in mics offer decent sound that seems slightly biased toward the higher end. In my video, the first part in the studio, you'll hear how it records my voice.<br />The size of the H4n makes it handy without being too big or too small. The transport buttons are large enough for big fingers. Critical buttons illuminate, indicating which mics are employed and when recording is taking place.<br />It's easy to switch between memory folders so if you're going from one job to the next between downloads you can keep the files separate.<br />Also included are a foam wind screen, a mic stand adapter, AC adapter, and a plastic case. Nice little accessories that are useful. (If you're going to use it outside, it's best to buy a fuzzy wind suppressor.) The AC adapter means you can make long recordings in the studio or on location without fear of running out of battery power.<br /><br />The Zoom H4n is now a critical part of my audio/video rig. Already my musician friends want to borrow it to make demo recordings, but at this price point, I think they can afford to buy their own. By the way, an HD version of my video review is available on my YouTube channel, lenswork4. Much better resolution than the one here. At the end of the video you'll hear the sound of a few horse-drawn buggies crossing the tracks, another example of the recording quality of this device, although some credit needs to be given to the Rode NTG-2 microphone.ecording is taking place.<br />It's easy to switch between memory folders so if you're going from one job to the next between downloads you can keep the files separate.<br />Also included are a foam wind screen, a mic stand adapter, AC adapter, and a plastic case.

B004L3AR0K|4.0|The alluring and delicate features of Anne Hathaway are aptly on display in LOVE & OTHER DRUGS, a rom-com not suited for your Aunt Mildred.  As a matter of fact, this romantic \\"comedy\\" is much more than that; it is a multi-dimensional story that portrays passion, fear, angst, denial, ambition, humor, and love--to name but a few components.  It's a tender love story centering around Jamie (Jake Gyllenhaal), a pharmaceutical rep about to ride the crest of the Viagra wave, and Maggie (Hathaway), a devout free spirit experiencing Stage 1 Parkinson's.  Their relationship begins as bedroom buds (with plenty of sizzle), with both pledging physicality and nothing more; of course nothing of the sort happens, as Jamie falls head over heels, and Maggie, smitten herself, does her best to run him off as she becomes sicker.  The subsequent bittersweet story has its decided ups and downs, culminating in an ending predictable yet satisfying.<br /><br />Gyllenhall and Hathaway sport great chemistry and deliver solid, believable performances, but real props belong to the second tier of the cast, including Josh Gad as Jamie's nerdy, unlucky-at-love kid brother, and Olvier Platt as Jamie's supervisor.  The comedic energy both bring to their roles is hysterical, especially Gad as he surprises a scantily clad Maggie who has come over to Jamie's apartment for some carnal delight.  The two augment the plot very nicely, and deliver constant comic relief.  And that's a plus, because LOVE & OTHER DRUGS is much more than your run-of-the-mill romantic comedy.<br />--D. Mikels, Esq.

B00005UDYA|4.0|I found this movie by mistake while I was reading reviews about the film, \\"The Hunger Games.\\"  One reviewer claims the author of the book of the same name loosely adapted the story from, \\"Battle Royale.\\"  Having yet to go see, \\"The Hunger Games\\" I cannot provide any information regarding any similarities between the two films.<br />Researching more, rumors about a re-make is in the works in Hollywood. Can't wait to see that one.  Anyway, back to this version.  I can't say its the greatest movie in the world, nor can I say it is the worst movie ever made, nevertheless the theme of the movie is  disturbing, which is why I gave the movie four stars.  I found it plausible for society today to implement a plan to discipline, not just kids, but anyone who is unruly in society.  If you have a chance, watch this one.  Also would like to recommend, \\"The Running Man\\" 1987, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger.

His team's assignment landed them in a near-hopeless situation, yet they called on every bit of their training, intelligence, stamina, and determination to keep going.  Lone Survivor is a portrait of bravery, toughness, loyalty, and unwaivering faith in the face of almost insurmountable odds.<br /><br />We owe our servicemen and women a huge debt of gratitude for what we ask them to endure in our name.

B002XTBEDI|5.0|With lots of material left over from the original \\"Cranford\\", it was always a given that we'd get to see more delightful stories from the rural Cheshire village and it's endearing inhabitants.  These two 90-minute episodes finally tie up the stories of Miss Matty, Harry, Miss Galindo, Lady Ludlow and Cranford's irrepressible \\"Amazons\\" Miss Pole (Imelda Staunton), Mrs Forrester (Julia McKenzie), Mrs Jamieson (Barbara Flynn), and Miss Tomkinson (Deborah Findlay).<br /><br />It's been a year since the events of the last series of \\"Cranford\\", and much has changed in the community.  Dr Harrison and Sophy have left the district, and so have Jessie and Major Gordon.  Widower Mr Buxton (Jonathan Pryce), an old resident of Cranford, returns with his now-grown son William (Tom Hiddleston) and spirited ward Erminia (Michelle Dockery).  On the other side of the social divide is the lovely Peggy Bell (Jodie Whittaker).  Cranford's newest romance has a lot riding against it, though, with Buxton very vocal in his displeasure at Peggy eventually becoming William's wife.  Mrs Jamieson's sister-in-law Lady Glenmire (Celia Imrie) is another enchanting newcomer.<br /><br />After closing down her enterprising parlour tea shop, Miss Matty (Dame Judi Dench) has settled into the joyful role of being a second mother to Tilly, the little daughter of Martha and Jem (Claudie Blakley and Andrew Buchan), whilst her brother Peter (Nicholas Le Prevost) provides the necessary money to keep the Jenkyns household going.  To her joy, Miss Matty once again has an extended visit from Mary Smith (Lisa Dillon), who reveals that she has firmly resolved to call an end to her engagement in order to set forth on a career as a novelist.<br /><br />At Hanbury Court, Lady Ludlow (Francesca Annis) is dying, but still firmly clinging to her land, which is constantly threatened by the ever-encroaching railway.  Miss Galindo (Emma Fielding) finally manages to secure Lady Ludlow's son Lord Septimus (Rory Kinnear) to return during a brief trip from his villa at Lake Lugano, but Lady Ludlow passes away before he arrives.  When Septimus unravels the bleak financial condition of the estate and realises that he'll have to eventually pay back Lady Ludlow's mortgage into the inheritance of young Harry Gregson (Alex Etel), he attempts to manipulate the boy into accepting a smaller immediate payment in lieu of the larger amount owed, underestimating the powerful ally that Harry has in Miss Galindo, and her fervent quest to see Mr Carter's last wishes carried out.<br /><br />The central dilemma in town remains the prospect of the railway \\"invading\\" the peace and calm of Cranford itself.  It's an argument which is pitting father against son, neighbour against neighbour, and driving away many valued workers, including Jem, who has become one of the local craftsmen drawn to the higher wages offered by the railroad company.  Despite her own fears and reservations, Miss Matty organises for her closest friends to experience rail travel first-hand, and unwittingly triggers a series of dramas with wide-reaching consequences for several Cranford residents...<br /><br />As in the original CRANFORD miniseries, there is much to love and savour in this all-too-brief sequel.  Screenwriter Heidi Thomas is one of my personal favourites and she is a great practitioner in the art of how to write for period drama.  She has a particular knack for immersing herself in the period and creating a true dialogue, with great feeling and affection for her characters, and quite frequently hilarious.  I know of no other costume drama writer who can write such brilliant comedy - and with the antics of Miss Pole, Mrs Forrester and Mrs Jamieson, Heidi Thomas is in her element.<br /><br />The performances remain utterly delightful.  Only a top-drawer series like CRANFORD could attract the likes of Dame Judi Dench, Imelda Staunton, Julia McKenzie, Jonathan Pryce, Francesca Annis and Nicholas Le Prevost; in addition to bright young costume drama stars like Michelle Dockery (\\"Downton Abbey\\") and Matthew McNulty (\\"Lark Rise to Candleford\\"). It's like a Theatre Rep company from the good old days.<br /><br />You'll never want to leave this town...ght young costume drama stars like Michelle Dockery (\\"Downton Abbey\\") and Matthew McNulty (\\"Lark Rise to Candleford\\").

I was dead wrong.<br /><br />The script and dialogue put me to sleep. Not even Sam Worthington nor Liam Neeson (He did fine as Zeus) could save the movie. The directions and pace of the movie was a lullaby. Me and a few friends actually fell asleep half way through the movie.<br /><br />The monsters and giants were well done. But, they had no character and died off far too easily. There was no challenge. No obstacle. It felt like a walk in the park.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and skip this movie.

Joe, Transformers, Thundercats, etc) so when I heard there would be a live-action Transformers film in 2007 I was totally cought up in the hype. Still, I knew all about Michael Bay's style of directing from his previous films (The Rock, Pearl Harbor, The Island). He shoots WAY TOO FAST, he makes sure the dialogue is spewed out so that no one can understand half of it, and he always makes sure the action scenes are so sloppy that no one can see whats happening.<br />  When I saw the first Transformers movie on opening day I expected that it would be like any previous Michael Bay film: loud, messy, and barely coherent...and he did not disappoint! Still, I found it to be an enjoyable movie despite its obvious flaws (I did buy it after all). Of course, since Hollywood can't leave well-enough alone, especially if they think they can make a buck or two, we all knew there would be multiple sequels and they wouldn't waste any time to crank them out. Since my views of the first film's flaws were shared by so many of the TRUE fans, I had hoped Bay would take them into consideration and correct them for the next films...oh how wrong I was!<br />  Transformers; Revenge of the Fallen was an unnecessary action trainwreck with annoying characters (the stereotyped Twins, anyone?), an uninspired story that no one could remember, and scenes that made no sense. Case in point: Sam and Mikaela are in the National Air and Space Museum in WASHINGTON DC when they find Jetfire, then they leave the building and suddenly they're in the middle of a DESERT? Can anyone explain that to me??? It was literally a non-stop action sequence that only appealed to pre-teens suffering from A.D.D. Needless to say, I did not add it to my DVD collection.<br />  With the disapointment of the 2nd film, I lost all faith in Michael Bay as a director, sketchy as it was to begin with. But you know what? I STILL went to see Darkof the Moon on opening day without any expectations that I would actually be sitting down to enjoy a GOOD movie. Two and a half hours later I left the theater with a splitting HEADACHE! You know you saw a terrible movie when it leaves you in physical pain caused by its stupidity. The visuals were good (as is always the case with Industrial Light and Magic), but it doesn't matter how real the effects look if you can't even see them! Every shot literally lasts less than 2 seconds. The only logical conclusion is that the film makers DID NOT want anyone to see what was happening. Really, would it hurt Michael Bay to slow things down even a little? Not at all. In fact, people would thank him for it!<br />  The new female lead played by Rose Huntington-Whitley (SP?) was only there for the eye-candy factor. Don't get me wrong, I love sexy ladies, but she literally added nothing else to the stoy. Why was she included at all? Because the film makers decided Shia needed a hot girlfriend. That's it. She's also always 'pristine'. She can be in the middle of a battle with smoke and debris everywhere, but she's still magazine-cover perfect. Get real. The only thing I was truly blown away by was finding out that Sentinal Prime was a bad guy ---- did not see that coming.<br />  Writing out all the GOOD things about the movie makes for a much shorter list, but it's in my nature to point out flaws that should be corrected instead of what needs no attention. Therefore, like Revenge of the Fallen, Transformers; Dark of the Moon was a never-ending action TRAINWRECK with total destruction in every shot; it only appeals to people with an I.Q. below 85. The effects were a sloppy mess, the plot was forgettable (but when was \\"story\\" ever a priority to Michael Bay?), every line of dialogue was SHOUTED, incoherent, or said so fast you could not understand it. This movie wouldn't even find a place of honor at a yard sale. Avoid it at all costs.

B001LV5OOY|5.0|With a manic energy driven by busy keyboard dance themes and heavy deep double-bass rolling kicks White Lies bursts onto the scene with a pack of songs that keep an almost macabre, haunted tone shimmering in the air.  If I had to describe this in four words?  Gothic synth pop bliss.  Thank goodness I'm not limited to those four words though.  There is a strong coherence between the 10 songs on this album; they sound like they are coming from the same artist off the same album while many, if not most, of them manage to maintain their own identity.  The White Lies' approach to music is to make it with big, obvious, swelling sounds that are very theatrical in musical, lyrical, and vocal approaches.  And now that I have gotten a basic, objective description out of the way let me move to a more subjective description...<br /><br />Oh! My! Gosh!  I love this!  The return of 80's gothic synth pop?  It's like Robert Smith and Ian McCulloch had a love child (Harry McVeigh).  McVeigh's voice works at being both booming deep and rich in it's highs and is suited to creating a suspenseful dread and longing.  Musically you can throw in a dash of Depeche Mode, a twist of early Tears For Fears, and even the smallest pinch of The Dream Academy!  Most of the songs tell some little story such as the opener using the idea that the narrarator is about to die in an airplane crash or the duplicitous betrayed lover ransom scheme of the final song.  My point is that the lyrics generate a strong interest and make you want to explore them; they are often solid enough to give you the framework of a story and what is going on and yet vague enough to make you wonder about the specifics.  Conceptually the ablum often deals with the thought of what has been or is about to be taken away or lost (death seems more obvious but that is missing the point).<br /><br />Because I am enjoying this release so much both because of the music, McVeigh's rich voice, and the story-songs I wanted to end this review with a lyrical excerpt from each song (for those who actually pay attention to lyrical content) and by noting which songs that, for me, are stellar 5 star songs:<br /><br />1) Death: \\"Floating neither up or down I wonder when I will hit the ground\\"  About a passenger on an airliner falling out of the sky.<br />2) To Lose My Life: \\"Let's grow old together and die at the same time\\"  About missed opportunities to be with the one you love.<br />3) A Place To Hide: \\"And if judgment day started tonight at least I'd know I was right/ And I'd be laughing at the end of the world\\"  About the breaking out of war and the feeling of loss of security that that can create.  Wind-blown; apocalyptic.  5 stars.<br />4) Fifty On Our Foreheads: \\"We were a dozen to the project/ With a galaxy of questions/ And all we heard was lies about the truth\\"  A very poetic and enigmatic song but I'm not sure what it is referencing though the subject is the separation from a loved one, seeing from the future a leaving in the past that was going to turn into a separation that the lovers did not realize or see at that time.  5 stars.<br />5) Unfinished Business: \\"So get off your low and let's kiss like we used to\\"  Funeral dance music coming out of the scars of a relationship touched by a mental or emotional breakdown.  5 stars.<br />6) E.S.T.: \\"I leave my memories in blood on the floor/ And my ffears with the nurse on the stairs\\"  Another that I having been able to penetrate but the scene conjures up a person being either experimented or operated on with the concern of one's dreams being lost but never taken.<br />7) From the Stars: \\"He catches raindrops from his window/ It reminds him how we fall\\"  About a well-to-do but ultimately empty and lonely friend who attended a youthful friend's funeral and follows him as he ponders the past afterward.  An extremely affecting and moving song.  My favorite on the album.  5 stars.<br />8) Farewell To the Fairground: \\"I feel like I'm casting off my clothes/And I'm running through the snow towards the sunset/ And I'm always with you\\"  A zombie dirge shambling back toward the loss of youth as we march toward the end of life.<br />9) Nothing To Give: \\"I wish I could say/ That I've got no regrets/ But saying that would be one more/ To pile on my desk\\"  Some of the best vocals on the album, just soaring, are on this song about regret over opportunities missed between persons.  5 stars.<br />10) The Price of Love: \\"Don't lay a finger\\" I said but he held her with five\\"  The last song is a theatrical, almost cinematic experience of a man trying to save his abducted wife (lover?) by paying out a ransom that he can't quite make; we're treated to the understanding, though, that the wife/ lover is in cahoots with the abductor  who leaves her when he can't get his money.  Crazy!  5 stars.<br /><br />I haven't gotten around to their follow-up but I am looking forward to it.  Hope you will enjoy this as much as I do.And I'm running through the snow towards the sunset/ And I'm always with you\\"  A zombie dirge shambling back toward the loss of youth as we march toward the end of life.<br />9) Nothing To Give: \\"I wish I could say/ That I've got no regrets/ But saying that would be one more/ To pile on my desk\\"  Some of the best vocals on the album, just soaring, are on this song about regret over opportunities missed between persons.  5 stars.<br />10) The Price of Love: \\"Don't lay a finger\\" I said but he held her with five\\"  The last song is a theatrical, almost cinematic experience of a man trying to save his abducted wife (lover?) by paying out a ransom that he can't quite make; we're treated to the understanding, though, that the wife/ lover is in cahoots with the abductor  who leaves her when he can't get his money.

B001E45XT4|5.0|I have gone through many headsets in my CPU gaming days, and this is the best headset I have come across, and for about $20 (Amazon has it on sale right now), who can beat that? Not only is it made really well, but the chord doesn't twist up like the Fatal1ty headset I had (which I went through 2 of in one year due to the mic not working).<br /><br />The sound is so loud that I usually only use half the volume; and I do have the advanced settings on for the headset (in control panel>sound>headset>properties>enhancement). I can't use the Bass Boost with Skyrim, though, because it just picks up the bass in the music.<br /><br />The comfort is absolutely amazing. I have always had issues with several of my gaming headsets hurting the tops of my ears during long gaming sessions. Since Plantronics features a box-shaped headset, it goes around my ear comfortably and I can game however long I want.<br /><br />I'm not sure how others can give this headset a bad review. It doesn't put too much pressure on your head at all, has plenty of cushioning, an amazing make and awesome sound. What more could you ask for?<br /><br />I wish I had known about Plantronics before and bought them. It would have saved me a lot of time searching for a good gaming headset.

B003Y5H5BA|3.0|There is a moment in 21 Jump Street when Tatum and Hill's adult cops posing as kids arrive at the high school for the first time where you know things are shortly going to go very, very bad for them.  The surprise isn't that it goes bad but how it goes bad: Tatum's character, \\"Jenko\\", is the typical dumb cool kid jock who seemingly had everything that all the nerds wanted in HS while Hill's character, \\"Schmidt\\", was the smart fat loser kid.  As the two get out of their car and re-enter the world of HS almost 7 years afterward, posing as brothers, Jenko rides Schmidt for wearing his backpack using both straps instead of just one slung over the side a la the cool kids.  \\"I don't want to be seen with you, man, you don't wear your bag like that!\\"  But as they walk along the camera shows you all of the cool kids, the jocks and preppies and rich kids and clubbers, are all wearing their backpacks with both straps on.  Jenko, bewildered, scratches his head, \\"What is this, man?\\"  As they walk past more groups that aren't cool (the goths, the stoners, and even a small chirp of Japanese girls dressed in cosplay whom Jenko acknowledges, \\"I don't even know what they are!\\") Jenko drops his jaw as they are all single-slinging it.  Schmidt, with a big grin, is avenged.  As with much of this movie everything for the partners is turned inside-out, upside down.<br /><br />It is moments like this that make this film an enjoyable comedy.  It is the updated, fish-out-of-water notions that are well and wisely played here that offer up the biggest laughs.  The preoccupation with jokes concerning male genitalia and some of the more routine odd-couple buddy cop comedies are nicely played if nothing new.  The cameos of our heroes from the original television series (but where was Aoki? and Fuller?) are fun and even surprising (DeLuise is almost unrecognizable and I completely missed Richard Grieco) and will only add to the enjoyment of those of us who remember the original series with some fondness.  I'd recommend this movie for the teens for a few laughs.  Hardcore fans of the original series might have wanted something a bit more serious out of this.ndness.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|In the final installment of E L James' Fifty Shades trilogy, the main characters settle into playing house, albeit unconventionally, while facing the past and present obstacles that prevent them from living happily ever after.<br /><br />Fifty Shades Freed begins with Anastasia Steele Grey and Christian Grey on their honeymoon after a short engagement and even shorter courtship. Even though they are obviously in love and manage to positively affect each other, life is far from a perfect paradise.<br /><br />Ana continues to adjust to her new life as the wife a gazillionaire. At the same time, she wants to make a name for herself professionally, but finds that difficult with her newly-acquired fame. It's a struggle many woman face. We want to be independent. We want to rely on ourselves. But then again, it is also nice to have someone take care of you. Is it possible to have it both ways without compromising your values? That is Ana's quest.<br /><br />Though making strides to heal the deep wounds from his past, Christian still defaults to his controlling and bristled manner when he feels threatened. Unfortunately, though falling madly in love with Ana has brought him out of his shell in many ways, it also makes him vulnerable. Sometimes, his control appears with him showing up unexpected in Ana's office to lay down the law and others in the bedroom (or playroom... or car... or yacht... or...)<br /><br />While in the first novel, Christian's control was basically incomprehensible and seemed cruel, now it's different. Building on the last book, this installment further explains Christian's past, making his actions more understandable and less freaky. He controls, because he after years of no control, he needs something to hold onto. For the most part, his actions have mellowed, because of Ana's influence. He genuinely loves her and does not want to hurt her.<br /><br />That is what makes these books so interesting. It is not the S&M or sex that makes these books appealing. It is about finding out what brought Christian to this point. It is about the journey of watching Ana bring him out of his shell. It is about watching them fall in love, accept responsibility for the past and build a fresh life together with the lessons they learned.<br /><br />This final piece also contains a bonus short story titled Fifty Shades of Christian. In it, we see Christian's first Christmas with the Grey's and his point of view during his initial meeting with Ana. After reading the books, this was a welcome addition and gave even greater insight into a complicated man.<br /><br />Overall, the characters are fascinating. The story is compelling. The words are well-written. It was definitely worth the hours I spent reading, and it went by quickly. Plus, it was super hot.

It stands up fairly well. Sometimes it falls if you do have the right angle or placement but for the most part the case is well worth the money. I got the pink and it is a great color.

B000PMFS2I|4.0|I remember how America particularly lost their minds hearing Elizabeth Berkley would be in this sexy and racy film, especially coming off a very successful pop-culture series in Saved by the Bell.  Like most I had to see this movie, however, I was much too young to watch. A year later, I got to see it and I was crying laughing at this movie.  Woah, it has everything in a bad picture: mediocre acting, campy lines, a recycled storyline and cue the nudity and guess what -- I loved it!  I can't help it, it's simply a guilty pleasure and thanks to Elizabeth stamp tagging her name to this, it will give me fond memories.  I was also introduced to Gina Gershon, mercy, was she smoking hot!  I still watch Gina's work since Showgirls.  Say this picture is awful all you like and be disgusted by its content(it isn't for everyone).  Yet this is a cult classic for those who remember the hype and excitement surrounding Showgirls and still lives on for older and newer viewers!
0345803485|4.0|E L James' debut novel \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" had me blushing fifty shades of pink before I was halfway through the story.<br /><br />Ana Steele is about to graduate college, but first she volunteers to interview Christian Grey, the university's elusive eligible bachelor benefactor. Sparks fly instantly between the pair, and Ana soon finds herself the object of Mr. Grey's interest.<br /><br />Innocent to relationships and sex, Christian catches her off guard with an indecent proposal to be the submissive to his dominant self -- in and out of the bedroom. In return, Christian agrees to delve into a side of relationships he has never before embarked on: intimacy and romance. What follows is a journey filled with confusion and turmoil as each tries to make it work without compromising who they are.<br /><br />For me the book was a D, but only if D stands for dirty, delightful and definitely delicious. No stranger to romance, but a relative innocent to erotica, the book's sexiest moments had me muffling my giggles in a pillow so as not to disturb my roommates. Paired with the sexy came equally sentimental, funny and intriguing moments, which made the story whole.<br /><br />Fast-paced and entertaining, with well-developed characters with history too deep to divulge in one book, Fifty Shades had me turning the pages furiously in my race to the end. Beyond the suspense and steam, the book was written and paced well, making it an enjoyable and easy read.<br /><br />The widely popular eBook is now available in mass print, gaining notoriety as \\"mommy porn.\\" But beyond the steamy sex and tension lies even greater issues, which the author handles beautifully. More than a story about sexual preferences and a virtuous woman versus a libertine, the book delves into complex issues about adoption, abandonment and feminism.<br /><br />With a surprise twist to the conclusion, the novel successfully made me care about the characters and the story enough to start the second book within minutes of finishing the book.<br /><br />(Rating: 4.5 of 5 -- originally published at [...])of 5 -- originally published at [...])

0307279189|5.0|Let me make this clear, I am not a runner by any stretch of the imagination, but this book made me want to be.  I first saw reviews of this book a couple years ago but never got around to buying it, so when I got it as a birthday present I dug in.  Less than a week later I had turned the last page and my view on running was changed forever, I hadn't absorbed a book that fast since the last Harry Potter book years ago.  Others have commented about the author's excessive use of hyperbole and BAM! in-your-face style of writing, but it appealed to me.  Lets face it, in this world of nonstop action packed doses of information we're trained to want the next big BANG, and McDougall delivers at every turn.  Sure the characters might be slightly exaggerated and certain parts more bias ridden than others but those are parts of story telling, just because it's non fiction doesn't mean it has to be as dry and mundane as a textbook.  The book fundamentally switched my way of thinking from connecting running with exercise to, instead, looking at it as a way of life.<br /><br />  I was especially interested in the parts about the Running Man Theory as a recent graduate with a degree in Biology and interests in biomechanics (I am no expert, for all those politically correct pundits out there), and the relatively recent emergence of running shoes claiming to fix a problem that we may not have.  I dug up all the articles that McDougall mentioned and was stunned by some of the research and insight pointing towards the benefits of barefoot/minimalist running.  After hundreds of thousands of years of adaptation the idea that we would need a piece of bouncy plastic on our feet to do something as natural as running is just obscene.<br /><br />  Although I understand that more long term research needs to be done in order to find better evidence for the barefoot theory I decided I couldn't wait.  The day after I finished the book I went out and got myself a pair of those toe shoes (I won'tname the company because don't want everyone thinking I'm endorsing something), bare feet just doesn't work outdoors when all you have to work with is pavement and asphalt. And after years of trying to run and being miserable I finally think I found that something extra to keep me wanting to do it day in and day out.  I actually look forward to running rather than dreading it night and day.  If you want to make a running a part of your life buy this book, from all the rave reviews I don't think you'll be disappointed.<br /><br />  And finally, the vivid description of the Tarahumara culture and people really brought home the whole message of using our bodies to discover some kind of peace and harmony.  Again, as some of the reviewers pointed out, some of McDougall's statistics of no crime within the tribe may not be entirely true, nevertheless I am still hopeful that there can only benefits from harnessing our abilities to run, in both heart and mind.  Here's to one day being part of the Copper Canyon Ultramarathon and RIP Caballo Blanco (wish I could've met you)!!!

Although I enjoyed(even being a little difficult to read)this book, the preface should have been left out or should be over looked. The preface does raise valid points, but the author tries to convert you to Christianity. It seemed a tad out of place, but over all a very informational read.

0345803493|4.0|After leaving us hanging at the end of Fifty Shades of Grey, E L James brings Ana Steele and Christian Grey back together in Fifty Shades Darker.<br /><br />Vowing to find middle ground and compromise, Ana and Christian throw themselves into their relationship to make it work. What started as an instant attraction between the couple in book one manifests itself into deep commitment and love throughout the romantic story.<br /><br />While building intimacy, Ana helps Christian come out of his emotional cave better than 20 years of therapy and a happy life with his adopted family. Christian also opens up old wounds and divulges never-before shared secrets from his past. At the same time, he must deal with his urges to be controlling and jealous where Ana is concerned. Watching him open and share his soul is enjoyable.<br /><br />Who doesn't like to watch a bad boy go good?<br /><br />Even as they follow in love, outside forces interfere causing trouble in their personal and professional lives. Finally on the same path, Ana and Christian fight to keep their love growing as they go up against adversity.<br /><br />We also come face-to-face with women from Christian's past, who bring forward more of his back story. His family and therapist, who are mentioned and sometimes present in book one, play a much bigger role in the second book. As the cast grows, so do the complications involved with each of them.<br /><br />Perhaps my favorite in the trilogy, Fifty Shades Darker succeeds at painting a better picture of Christian as a man and human. In book one, he is mysterious and little is known about why he is who he is. In the second book, it becomes obvious that the man is not a sexual deviant with an overpowering fetish, but a person fighting the emotional wounds endured in his earliest years.<br /><br />Though the sex loses some of its edge from the first book, it is replaced by welcome emotion and a deeper connection between Ana and Christian. Through this story, we see that it is possible to overcome terrible pasts when you have the right people to support you.<br /><br />A solid second book, Fifty Shades Darker pushes forward the important elements of the first book while setting up the intrigue and mystery to be resolved in the third.<br /><br />(originally published at [...])that it is possible to overcome terrible pasts when you have the right people to support you.<br /><br />A solid second book, Fifty Shades Darker pushes forward the important elements of the first book while setting up the intrigue and mystery to be resolved in the third.<br /><br />(originally published at [...])

013168728X|1.0|I didn't buy this book, frankly, for one reason, enough already with Leena.  We all know the female is a head shot from a playboy spread.  Really?  I'm a female engineer and yes, I'm offended.  I actually brought this up to my professor and yes, the picture is cropped and yes, I still find it offensive.  There you go.  I dont pay thousands of dollars for a course, in a professional field, and have a book assigned to me that I am forced to purchase for a hundred dollars that installs this tongue in cheek good old perverted boys cropped image of a playboy spread.  Unless you want to add some male porn stars, you might want to rethink the cover image.  Enough already.  Yes, at one time all engineers were men. Lovely. At one time slavery was socially acceptable too, so shall we mix in a photo of one in a field as well.  How dense is this publisher?  You might want to try to pick a cover that isn't offensive to half the population.<br /><br />Thankfully the professor was more than apologetic, the book is ok, he said, nothing terribly special.  He offered me a substitute that would do just as well.  He will look into a substitute for this book for the entire class for next semester.<br /><br />I'm glad I may have been instrumental to making this image go obsolete for my university.<br /><br />So you know.....
B001DLQFG8|5.0|En español<br /><br />Las películas surrealistas de la guerra tienen su propia belleza demente mucho más allá del grito de batalla, como completamente demostrado en la obra maestra cinemática de Francis Ford Coppola \\"Apocalpyse Ahora\\". El crédito inmediato es dado a la novela de Joseph Conrad & el juego de la moral \\"Corazón De la Oscuridad\\", como la inspiración para el 'busca y mata su objetivo' guión militar por John Milius, por Coppola, y por Michael Herr. Esto es importante, como uno fechó clásico (escrito por Conrad en 1899) ahora ha sido adaptado (reparó como una M-14 rifle en 1979) en un cuento moderno de hazañas Especiales de Fuerzas. Una vez más nosotros somos dejados caer en la selva, al igual que con sus mejores películas del comando. Ponemos nuestro engranaje de batalla, cargamos nuestra munición & armas, y se embarcamos 'dondequiera nuestras órdenes nos toman', viene el infierno o la pleamar. No hay devolviéndose.

1439192812|5.0|Richard Dawkins, bestselling author of The Selfish Gene and The God Delusion, needs little introduction; and neither does illustrator Dave McKean, who has worked with a number of well-known authors, including Neil Gaiman, and was the creator behind the movie MirrorMask.  Now the two have joined together to bring you a unique book of science and evolution called The Magic of Reality.    In the first chapter of The Magic of Reality, Richard Dawkins sets the stage with an important explanation of the differences between reality and how incredible it can be, and the impressiveness of magic and miracles and how they are just illusions and not real.  The book explores a number of astonishing things about our world and universe, and how we have come to know it, such as: who the first person was, what things are made of, what is the sun, what is a rainbow, and what is an earthquake, to name a few.  The last two chapters are perhaps the most important, as Dawkins talks about why bad things happen to people, and what exactly a miracle is.    The Magic of Reality is an important read for anyone who is uncertain about the world we live and how it came to be the way it is.  Dawkins puts thoughts and sayings, extreme coincidences, good and bad luck in perspective, saying you may think it an incredible series of incidents to lead to a specific point that it may seem like there is some power or force behind it, but when you study each of those incidents on a scientific level, it all makes perfect sense to be just that: an incredible coincidence.  Coupled with Dave McKean's captivating and mind-blowing illustrations to help illustrate points and reveal the complexity of seemingly ordinary things, The Magic of Reality is an important book to have, whether you're looking to help an adult make up their minds about something, or constructively and efficiently educating a youngster who is learning about science and the way of life.

B005HSL626|3.0|I wanted the fruit to be cut the way I sliced them but the fruit only cut in the same places everytime (always cut horizontally in the middle), which took away from the fun of the game for me. I played on kindle fire with my wifi off so I never had ads. The arcade mode is fun, zen mode is slow and boring for the lack of music, and classic mode starts out extremely slow and slicing one bomb ends the mode. I played for a while but got bored quickly, would not reccomend. Still deserves atleast 3/5 for decent graphics and smooth gameplay.

Hope she writes more books in the very near future.
B004ZISVWC|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It was very unique and having never been to any Scandinavian countries, I very much enjoyed the scenery. There are some wonderful shots sprinkled throughout of the landscape and it made me want to take a trip! For how involved trolls are in the culture over there, I'm very surprised that there aren't more movies that make it to the USA like this. The CGI is also pretty good - there are a few scenes where I felt like they didn't even need to show a troll, but when they make their way on screen, you're not let down.<br /><br />Although this movie may be compared to Cloverfield, in my opinion the similarities end with the filming style. There are only a few scenes that have the same sort of claustrophobic feeling, and I have to say only once was there the same sort of \\"horror\\" feel. What you think will be the plot of the entire movie is resolved in the first half, which was a twist in itself. This movie was not predictable like most horror/scary movies are.<br /><br />This movie was a great change of pace and although I don't think it would be necessary to watch it again, I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a unique thriller that cannot be closely compared to any other movies in recent memory. Sorry for the rambling, I tried to write this as I watched the movie so it may not be too coherent. Hope this helps someone out there!
1401233066|4.0|This new volume in the award-winning and fabulous Fables series features the familiar, amazing artists Mark Buckingham and Steve Leialoha, and some well known guest artists with Eric Shanower and Terry Moore.  Shanower pencils an interesting introductory tale from fableland, while Terry Moore does the art of the moving final tale of \\"Waking Beauty.\\"    At the heart of the volume is the story of the \\"super team.\\"  Mr. Dark has Fabletown bowing to his whim, wreaking his evil and darkness, and must be stopped at all costs.  He is now growing his dominance in the land of fable, blocked by a protective force field by Flycatcher.  They're going to need a crack team of really strong fables, the F-Men, to stop this Mr. Dark.  They're going to need the likes of Werewolf Man, and The Golden Knight, and maybe the Green Witch.  They'll need training and simulations to be ready, but ultimately someone much stronger will be needed to take down this master of darkness and fear.    Super Team does what every volume since the start has done: furthered the compelling story, as well as introducing new material and new fables, to keep the readers hooked.  The fresh art styles of Shanower and Moore add to the magic, making this volume a requirement for any fan.    Originally written on December 30, 2011 ©Alex C. Telander.

1401310672|4.0|In this incredible and wonderful period of Smartphones, it is all very likely that humanity will look back on this time as the remarkable invention of the iPhone and the power and ability that was unleashed with this invention.  And with this marvelous invention there was texting; and with this fantastic ability to text, there was . . . autocorrect.  For those who aren't in possession of an iPhone, or may not be familiar with it, one \\"perk\\" of the texting application is the autocorrect feature that facilitates one's typing using the touch screen to automatically complete words and make (supposedly) it much quicker and easier to text.    Of course, the adage: \\"With great power, comes great responsibility\\" is powerfully true in this case, as this feature has led to innumerable errors, faux pas, and hilarious results that have now become infamous on the internets, dutifully and thankfully collected at the brilliant autocorrect website, Damn You Autocorrect.  And now the cream of the crop of entertaining autocorrects are collected in this perfect book to just have hanging around anywhere in the house or at work, or just about anywhere in the world, Damn You, Autocorrect!  And here are some highlights from this must have book:    Texter #1: \\"I just fell off the chair at work.\\"  Texter #2: \\"Are you OK?\\"  Texter #1: \\"Yes.

B00275EGWY|1.0|Having persuaded myself that America under President Obama is becoming more sophisticated in its approach to the Middle East -- opening its eyes to the complications of Afghanistan and Iraq, questioning its blanket support for Israel, renouncing the legacy of the neocons -- watching the film `The Hurt Locker' was an unexpected reality check of how slowly some things change.<br /><br />Within minutes, I was believing nothing that I was seeing. By half way, I was wondering why some intelligent friends could like a movie that seemed so absurd to me, and why there was such unanimity among top film critics to love it. By the time the credits started rolling, I was furiously puzzling about why Hollywood granted six Oscars to what seemed to be a screenplay more suited for retooling as a clever parody of B movie war films. `The Hurt Locker' clashes with almost all aspects of my experiences of Iraq, war zones and American soldiers, and, I believe, has an insidiously militarist subtext.<br /><br />Take the opening sequence: it is unthinkable that an Iraqi would casually come up to an American unit engaged in high-tension bomb disposal to exchange peculiar pleasantries about California. A middle-aged man appears at a butcher's shop fiddling clumsily with a cellphone. If he's deliberately triggering the bomb, why does he come outside where he will be seen and is in direct range of the blast? Or if he is an idiotic butcher trying to make a call, which coincidentally triggers the bomb, then any cellphone could set off an explosion. Every house in that street would have had people busily phoning each other. It gets worse: Sgt. James drags up seven booby-trapped 155mm shells with one hand (wish I could do that - that's about 300kg, the weight of three big men), a mad bomb disposal, insurgents who can hit moving targets with Kalashnikov rifles at absurd distances, and a truly bizarre solo mission into the back streets of Baghdad. I've gone on long enough: real veterans of the Iraq War have already taken issue with such details many times.<br /><br />Of course the film is fiction. But it does everything to make us believe it is representing reality. The script, the film's hype often boasts, resulted from work by an embedded freelancer who wanted to show the soldiers' war. The shaky camerawork is supposed to make us feel that we are watching an edgy documentary. The extras are real Iraqi refugees, being filmed in Jordan, sometimes as close as possible to the Iraqi border.<br /><br />That's because in documentary journalism, having the audience believe in the reality of a story is critical to triggering a strong emotional response. It's the same whether telling stories round a camp fire or writing for the New York Times. And this is where the `The Hurt Locker' does a real disservice to Americans. Although the film is shot with no overt politics or discussion among the soldiers about why they are in Iraq, there is a clear agenda behind all those brilliantly filmed slo-mo pressure waves, sinister improvised explosive devices and the jaunty, hips-thrust-forward gait of Sgt. James as he cockily lopes into action in his bomb suit.<br /><br />Take the film's portrayal of Iraqis, for instance. I can accept that ordinary American soldiers don't have the access to ordinary people that I was lucky to have as an Arabic-speaking civilian, and I too witnessed some of the soldiers' frustrated interactions with the `hajjis'. But nothing justifies the film's total negativity towards the inhabitants of the country, and it does not match my experience of the overall U.S. military work with Iraqis. One by one, `The Hurt Locker' portrays Iraqis as cowardly, poor, inadequate, base, stupid, treacherous, dangerous, wild, wily, living in filthy cities or most commonly just blank-faced and threatening. The only half-positive character is a cheeky DVD-selling boy on the base who is befriended by Sgt. James (note to casting director: when developing world kids pick up perfect jive-talk, they pick up perfectly fluent accents too). But other Iraqis, those inhuman nihilists, murder the boy or someone like him and then booby-trap his body.<br /><br />Having thoroughly transferred this most primitive view of Iraqis to the audience, the film also trashes the idea that they understand anything other than the language of force. The vehicle for this is the unit psychiatrist, portrayed as an other-worldly ivy-league man who means oh-so-well but is utterly out of his depth. This `doc' rides along with the disposal squad on a mission and is somehow left in the wasteland outside, mocked by the locals and the scriptwriter as he says absurdly `I love it here. This is a beautiful place.' (Another military disconnect: never would four lone soldiers take on a vast, newly discovered insurgent base and bomb-making factory.) His naïve and wimpish approach no doubt represents the ideas of silly liberals like me who believe that engagement is better than the use of force. It earns him the right, immediately granted by the director, to be blown away by the very people he's been foolish enough to try to be friendly to.<br /><br />For any who think I've been touched by too much of the real Middle Eastern sun, read on. The scene with the suicide bomber clinches it. Here, the forces of jihadi darkness have encased an man in a bomb jacket and he's begging to be defused, since, as he says, he's a decent family man with children and just wants to go home. The good American, Sgt. James, decides to risk his own life to free him from his fate. For those uninitiated in the doctrines of American Middle East militarists, this is the gloss: at great cost to ourselves, we are ready to liberate you from Saddam Hussein, we are idealistically struggling to bring you democracy, we want to free you from the cage of your tyrannical and/or Islamofascist regimes. But here's the problem: this Iraqi is locked into his bomb, and even Sgt. James's miracles can't release him. So on to the next step of the doctrine: ultimately, it's all the Middle East's fault. America has done its best to help, but the region is incurable. The bomb obliterates the Iraqi.<br /><br />To ram home the point that violence is the only way to deal with the Middle Eastern labyrinth, the film then sacrifices the only credible main character, the African-American Sgt. Sanborn. Having rightly resisted and criticized Sgt. James's antics for most of the film, Sgt. James's act of lunatic bravery with the suicide bomber inexplicably flips Sgt. Sanborn from being the common-sense foil into the accomplice. The subtext here is the shared ground between war-hungry Republican neocons and Democrat hawks -- the conceit that they are liberals \\"mugged by reality\\". It's the Bernard Lewis doctrine again: `hit those Muslims hard and they'll soon obey'. This message also lies behind by the early scene where Sgt. James's willpower and readiness to fire his pistol is all that forces a supposedly stubborn Iraqi to back down from a confrontation.<br /><br />It's possible that the film-makers have no agenda and were just mugged by common American prejudices about the Middle East's troubles. But I find an innocent explanation of `The Hurt Locker' hard to accept, since the reality that is doing the mugging here is so artificial. I have rarely seen a more undignified and unbelievable character progression as when the sensible Sgt. Sanborn suddenly salutes Sgt. James's lethally mad \\"courage\\". To add insult to injury, the director forces the face of the previously focused, four-square Sgt. Sanborn into an expression of dog-like devotion.<br /><br />This is of course a film told from the point of view of the ordinary soldier, to whom the situation in Iraq did seem pretty baffling. There are moments where the film does ring a faint bell, when we see the hesitant team specialist's terrors, or Sgt. James's sudden kindnesses to his companions under extreme pressure. But that doesn't go anywhere near justifying all the other distortions. And the film fails utterly as a story: the crazy and mostly repetitive events of the film work no change in the hero, his family's needs do not melt him and he just goes back to the war. So the film ends more or less where it started, with Sgt. James doing his trademark I'm-the-king-of-the-hill walk, somewhere between keep on truckin' and nuke-them-all.<br /><br />That's because the film's principal theme is that \\"war is a drug\\", as journalist Chris Hedges put it in a compelling and self-critical book on his addiction to war reporting. Almost as if the director suspects that viewers won't get the point, the quote is spelled out not once but twice right after the opening credits. Friends whose views I respect say that this exciting representation of a war junkie is what keeps them thrilled to the end. They dismiss as unimportant the idea that the Middle Eastern context is distractingly misrepresented, and wave away my argument that a similar dice-with-death film could never have won such praise if it was filmed against an unrealistic American backdrop. But even on these narrow terms, I question the artistic value of a continuum of unchanging illustrations of Sgt. James's recklessness. There's no subtlety about it. The director seems to feel this weakness towards the end. When the film's quiet, nervous third main person is injured due to Sgt. James's folly, the film suddenly has him scream super-sophisticated blame of the danger-seeker's motives: \\"Looking for trouble to get your ****ing adrenaline fix, you ****?!\\" That's character development?<br /><br />If this film is really going to be studied in 20 years time as \\"a classic of tension, fear and bravery\\", as the New Yorker suggests, I hope the emphasis will be on finding out why film-directors, movie-goers and war-makers all seem to fall for such nonsense so easily.o the next step of the doctrine: ultimately, it's all the Middle East's fault.

0062060562|4.0|It's been done before but I love the whole Groundhog Day movie/book scenarios. This book takes a different slant on it though and tells the story of a woman who has no recollection of anything over the past twenty years, since she was in her early 20's. Therefore, each morning, she wakes up with no idea who the man is lying next to her (her husband, Ben) nor why her hair is grey, her face wrinkled and her clothes 'fuddy duddy-ish.' I look in the mirror every morning and wonder where the 'creases' have come from so can barely imagine what a shock it must be to look in the mirror at a face 20 years older than it should be in your head.<br /><br />Through the means of a journal, she learns a little more about herself each day as she begins the day reading about what she has learnt the previous day before she fell asleep and forgot it all. The first line she reads every morning is 'Don't Trust Ben.' Doesn't bode well for the rest of her day, does it? As a reader, you are made suspicious of Ben through the use of those 3 words alone. However, through the journal and the story itself, you are aware of other characters and to the reader, they are equally as innocent and perversely, untrustworthy, as Ben is (who comes across as a patient, honest man.) All of this leave little chills through the little hairs at the back of your neck. Definitely my type of book!<br /><br />Towards the end, I figured out what was going on (others of you will no doubt suss it all out much sooner but I'm a 'lazy' reader and never try to guess who the murderer is in a crime book, for example, as I like the author to just tell me what's going on and I like to just let the story pour slowly over me.) The book did leave me with a couple of unanswered questions at the end , which was a little annoying but not frustrating enough to stop my enjoyment of the book, which I really did enjoy.
B0070UFMOW|5.0|The Fiio E17 was something far better than the Fiio E11.<br /><br />I connected it to my Ultrasone Pro 900, and noticed some immediate difference between the E11.<br /><br />1. The base boost no longer destroyed, or crumbled my music.<br />It was so natural while significantly adding some 'boom'.<br />I felt the vocal getting pushed back without any awkwardness.<br /><br />2. The Treble adjuster was impressive as well.<br />Although a lot more harder to actually use it right, the right setting made some of my songs sound crystal clear.<br />After the E17 I finally started to appreciate the sound quality of Ultrasone Pro900.<br />However, any music with lower-than-320 kbps would rather sound better without any alterations.<br /><br />3. Other options like RL balance and impedance controls were fabulous as well<br /><br />Along with a pouch and a lot of 'cool stuff' to use along with the E17 itself, I once again was impressed with the Fiio.<br />I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a budget wise portable amp.<br /><br />I wish I could give it a 6 out of 5.

0385534639|5.0|As soon as I heard about this book, I knew I had to get my hands on it as I have loved circus books since reading and loving `Water for Elephants.' Unlike `WFE', Night Circus has a surreal and magical element to it. The magical `element' is actually a major part of the book as it centers around a Magician's daughter and a Sorcerer's apprentice.<br /><br />The aforementioned Magician and Sorcerer have been rivals for a very long time. When the Magician learns that he has a daughter who is unceremoniously dumped in his hands and who has inherited his magical powers, he seeks out the Sorcerer and challenges him to a magical duel featuring his daughter and a student of the Sorcere's choosing. A circus is created as the arena where the battle will take place, unbeknownst to the two `duellers' and all the folk employed in the circus. `The Night Circus arrives without warning. No announcements proceed it... It is simply there, when yesterday it was not.'<br /><br />I love this book.  It is beautiful and the characters and story are intriguing and very likeable.  The circus seems so real, despite having tents that contain some weird and wonderful displays from Wishing Trees to bottles that open to reveal stories that you experience by smell alone.  A clock at the main gate has `...a silver dragon that curls around the visible clockwork, a tiny princess in a carved tower who paces in distress; Teapots that pour into teacups and miniscule curls of steam that rise from them as the seconds tick.'  Somewhat predictably, the daughter and apprentice fall in love with each other but only one is aware that they are pawns in a lifelong battle between their respective father and tutor.  Other select characters are also aware, and it is fun and also nerve-racking to watch as they interact with each other not knowing what each character is privy to.

B002KSPKRS|2.0|After a small amount of research, The Ear Force x41s seemed to be the go-to for xbox gaming headphones. Im regretting buying them now though. There are two primary reasons for this: The first is sound quality; While the surround sound is very good, the sound quality is pretty terrible. Even with the bass boost enabled, the sound is very tinny. The second issue is battery life and how the headphones behave when the batteries start to die. I've been getting maybe 8 hours of play time on a pair of AAA batteries. When they start to go, the headphones will hiss and pop and then just cut out. Also, they can wreak havoc on in-game chats. Other players will sound like they echo to you AND to themselves and the others in the chat.
1401937268|3.0|I love this angel tarot deck. It very gentle and the artwork is fantastic. You can just feel the positive vibe from it when giving readings. The only down side to it is that it not for beginners. It not for people with small hands. The deck is  big and the texture is solid not cheap. The readings are all spot on.<br /><br /> 05/08/12Update i loved this deck at first because of the artwork but as time goes by i am coming to a conclusion that i can not work with this deck. It is too big to shuffle and not accurate at all. I really thought i can work with this deck but naw it only good as a daily drawing card. It not the kind of deck you can use to give readings to your clients.

The plot arcs stretch through family relations, loss, dystopian politics, war and warriors, coming-of-age, and so much more.<br /><br />It saddens me that so many took this series for a pulp romance and are disturbed that it did not follow a romance driven structure.<br /><br />This is an excellent series of books and I am delighted that I found them.
B00634GHJA|5.0|I have exact same app for iphone/ipad. I can transfer photos from to and from those two devices to my kindle fire with ease.
B007UMLE5Q|5.0|If you have been hearing a big sigh of satisfaction at work over a work place fracas, it is because the fans of Mad Men finally got something they've all wanted to do themselves: beat up Pete Campbell for being an all around jerk. It's taken five years but it was worth it. There is a marvelous scene with the kitchen faucet which precedes this and I think that kitchen faucet has more to do with Pete's behavior than anything else in the week following.<br /><br />We also get to see our band of mad men use a brothel when they are trying to land an automobile account from the UK. Naturally Roger Sterling knows where to find one.<br /><br />Surprisingly we get to see more dimensions to Blake, our UK mad man, in this episode.  I liked him a lot more in this episode than I've ever liked him before.  He is the one who trusted his fellow mad men to handle his UK client with discretion, not take him to a brothel. Ha!<br /><br />Great stuff, as usual.<br /><br />note: the episode mentions Whitman killing over twenty people in Austin, Texas from the clock tower with a rifle. I predict these violence mentions are going to continue and build to prepare us for the anti war violence just around the corner.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

0812992792|4.0|[...]    Close your eyes. Imagine, if you will, a country whose only law is the whim of its leader, a leader so self-aggrandizing and delusional that he would ask his people to believe that even the country's doves are patriotic enough to take a bullet for him.  A country that has installed mandatory loudspeakers in every home, loudspeakers that provide a constant barrage of propaganda and lies.  A country where anyone can be picked up off the street at end time and sent into the fields to perform hard labor.  A country where parents' fear can overshadow the love they feel for a child.    Welcome to Adam Johnson's North Korea.    In an interview with Richard Powers, Johnson says the following:    \\"...North Korea is real.  And to read the agonizing accounts of its victims is like swallowing stones.  One of the striking things about these accounts is how much is missing--there's often little emotion, reflection, or expressions of personal desire.  Which brings us back to trauma narratives, a hallmark of which is the way their narrators can get stuck in a kind of survival mode that takes precedence over voice, memory, and insight.  When life is about survival, rather than being human, people are less able to speak in terms of yearning, growth, discovery, change and so on.  How do you gain a deeper understanding of a person who's been taught that expression is dangerous and that emotions can get you killed?  What do you do when the only person who can tell a story is the least able to do so? This is where the limits of nonfiction become visible.  And it's where we must turn to fiction, which focuses on what deprivation does to identity, memory and basic humanity.\\"    The Orphan Master's Son tells the story of the role of identity and memory and it's affect on an individual's humanity, as well as the collective humanity and identity of a nation.  Johnson weaves the tale of the incredible life Pak Jun Do and his trials as pseudo-orphan, kidnapper, soldier, state spy and later, master impersonator.    Love story, thriller, coming of age story, this book was EVERYTHING and has all the elements I look for in my literature:      lyrical prose    compelling and dynamic characters    strong narrative voice    inspiring plot and electric actions    The world Johnson creates is so bizarre, so cruel, so dangerous that it's hard to look away.  I especially loved the second half of the book, where Johnson drops a giant talent bomb on the reader and demonstrates his absolute command of narrative and voice.  Each character, each moment WORKS in a way I haven't experienced in a piece in a long time.  When it comes out in January, move The Orphan Master's Son to the top of your \\"to read\\" pile!    Rubric rating: 8.  I will definitely be checking out Johnson's other works: Emporium, a short story collection, and his novel, Parasites Like Us.
1593157134|5.0|This book is kind of small and easy to read quickly; yet, the contents are<br />extremely valuable!

1594630844|5.0|I picked this book up at the library. It was hard to put down. Puts life in great perspective. Provides wisdom that only those who have lived a long full life can provide. How often have we wished we had realized some essential life lesson sooner. Well now you can learn sooner and benefit by making wiser life decisions. Highly recommended.
B007WPM4V4|5.0|Can you picture driving off while leaving your wife behind and she gets picked up by strangers and makes it home safely? We see that in this episode and I predict this is the calm before the violent storm brewing in Mad Men.  It would be unthinkable to do any of that today what with serial killers abounding on interstate highways.<br /><br />Can you picture your psychiatrist giving you LSD at a party while saying it is good for you and will open your mind?  Today not only would that be illegal but also malpractice.  But this was the mid 60s when Cary Grant was getting LSD from his psychiatrist and the neurotically affluent followed suit.<br /><br />Can you imagine giving a brilliant presentation to a client and he turns you down cold and wants you to start over?  Well, yes, we all can because that one, the dissatisfaction of one's clients and customers, is a universal which remains true to this day.<br /><br />Roger Sterling verges on being likable in this episode.  It can't last but it was interesting to see him in that mode for a change.<br /><br />Once again, great stuff.

0316926345|4.0|[...]    GENERAL SPOILER ALERT:  If you've never read Brideshead Revisited, and would like to discover it with no previous knowledge of the plot, I suggest you stop here.  Since it was published in 1944, I'm writing with the assumption that I'm the one late to the party and many of you lovers of literary fiction have probably either read it already or are super familiar with the plot.  So, if not, stop.  Now.  You've been warned.    Confession time:  Until a few years ago, I thought Evelyn Waugh's name was pronounced Eh-vah-lynn Wow, and that he was a she.  I wish I were kidding.  One of the great epic fails in book snobbery.  Regardless, every time I passed the \\"W\\" section at the bookstore or library, I'd see her his titles with their gorgeous cover art...but upon reading the back summary and coming to the words \\"set against the backdrop of World War II,\\" I usually put the book back on the shelf.  With few exceptions, I love historical fiction...as long as the book doesn't take place entirely in the trenches. Before you yell, please note that I'm sure my bias has kept me from discovering a great many tomes. I just have a hard time getting into several hundred pages of war and destruction and blood and death and politics and guns and moral turmoil and brotherly bonding/bromance, etc.  I know full well that there are many notable works of literature (mostly by dead white dudes) with fabulous plot lines and gorgeous prose (A Farewell to Arms, For Whom the Bell Tolls...well, just Hemingway in general, War and Peace,  All Quiet on the Western Front), and I'm sure I'll slug through a few of them for the general-betterment-of-self/expansion-of-overall-cultural-literacy at some point...it's just not my favorite.    BUT a few months ago, I DVR'd (yes, I still DVR) Brideshead Revisited when it aired on Ovation and fell in love with the story.  And when Waugh's name came up again in the Mitford biography I'm reading (he was friends with Nancy Mitford and is said to have takeninspiration from the Mitford kids among other Bright Young Things of the era), I read up on him and decided to add this and Vile Bodies to my 30-before-30 literary bucket list.    Brideshead Revisited is, in fact, set in the 1920s, 30s and 40s, the years leading up to World War II, though only the prologue takes us anywhere near the trenches (phew!).  Charles Ryder, our narrator, and his unit are stationed at Brideshead, which serves as catalyst for Charles to reflect on how he came to know the house and to tell the story of his two great loves who grew up there: Sebastian and Julia Flyte.    I know there's debate as to whether the nature of the deep relationship between Charles and Sebastian had a sexual aspect....in my opinion, Charles' love for Sebastian (and vice versa) was absolutely romantic (see the definition), in terms of their relationship being imbued with their desire for adventure and their idealization of and total dependence on the other, often steeped in a reality exclusively their own.  Also, I think they probably had sex at one point. Or at more than one point.  Or at least fooled around.  It was an era of experimentation (booze!  jazz!), and it wasn't super uncommon for young men to experiment that way in boarding school or when away at college, or because they were, in fact, gay or bisexual, etc.  (n.b. Tom Mitford, brother of Nancy Mitford et al, for example, is thought to have had at least one homosexual relationship in his youth and according to this Telegraph UK article, Waugh may or may not have been involved at one point with a gentlemen who has been said to have inspired Sebastian). I loved the contrast Waugh was able to strike between the love shared by Charles and Sebastian and the love shared by Charles and Julia.  Charles and Sebastian's relationship imploded because, in a way, they preferred to cling to the idealized version of the other (it's hard to live in the reality where the person you feel closest to is an alcoholic with somefairly deep emotional problems.  I think, in many ways, Sebastian's flight to Morocco, etc. occurred out of love for Charles, to protect Charles from destructive force he knew he had become.  Maybe on some level, Charles understood it as the gift of a unmarred, idyllic past, as he says on page 203 \\"These memories, which are my life--for we possess nothing certainly except the past--were always with me.\\").  Charles and Julia's romance imploded because they failed to move beyond the reality of their situation (i.e. Julia's deeply entrenched Catholic belief system was a tad restrictive, and then there was her nagging insistence upon avoiding eternal damnation...a bit prohibitive to a divorce/second marriage to another divorcee who also happens to be an agnostic).  It's a book as much about denial as it is about desire, and how both can be acts of love.    My favorite character by far was Cordelia, Sebastian Flyte's young sister, and I died laughing at scene where she talks Catholicism with Charles upon their first meeting:    \\"[Cordelia says] 'D'you know, if you weren't an agnostic, I should ask you for five shillings to buy a black god-daughter.'  [Charles] 'Nothing will surprise me about your religion.'  [Cordelia] 'It's a new thing a missionary priest started last term.  You send five bob to some nuns in Africa and they christen a baby and name her after you.  I've got six black Cordelias already.  Isn't it lovely?' \\"(p. 82)    She's so precocious, and fancies herself to be so forward thinking, yet she acts almost as a mirror against which Waugh is able to reflect back everything he saw wrong with the Catholic church at the time (and possibly with religion in general, but given that he and I never discussed the matter, this is purely conjecture), but she's also such a likable character due to her youth and wit.  Through Cordelia especially, Waugh shows us how no person is only one thing; that no thing is either solely good or bad.    Waugh was such a dynamic and flexible writer.  He possessed such a gift for characterization and voice! I wish I had even a fraction of his stylistic dexterity!  (Just a fraction! I'm not greedy!)  Even at the most tragic moments, Waugh's wit (I can't help noting these observational zingers as evocative of Oscar Wilde at his best in The Picture of Dorian Gray) shines through.  For example, when Lord Marchmain is dying, his mistress Cara says this of his condition:  \\"His heart; some long word at the heart.  He is dying of a long word.\\"  (p. 288)    Rubric rating: 8.5.  I need to read a few more titles by him before I definitively and officially induct him into the personal pantheon, but DAMN was he talented!
B004HUE57S|5.0|This is an excellent mouse. I have the small version and have been using it for several months. I thought there was no mouse that could get rid of pain caused by all day computer usage, until I found this mouse. Besides price, the only complaint I have is Evoluent not creating software for Mac OS. This problem has been rectified by using Steermouse.

B003ES61EE|2.0|I have the Nikon branded lenspen and now the cheap amazon knock-off. The Amazon version is poorly made, the cap doesn't stay on, and some of the bristles of the brush have been falling out. Overall this is a cheaply made imitation of the original. I haven't tried using it on an actual lens and I doubt if I ever will. Might use it to clean the screen on my phone, but that's about it. Spend the extra couple of dollars and get the better unit.
B000ZECQ08|4.0|The movies did not have English subtitles only French.  I have a hearing loss so I could not hear much of what was being said.  The odd part is the extra disk had English & French subtitles.  Go figure!

B004289ZW0|1.0|The touch sensor seems neat, but it stopped working after the first day.  Reset it but still no joy.  It's basically dead, and Support is nonexistent.<br />Nice idea, but bad implementation and no support
0790729407|2.0|This is a great movie, make no mistake!  However, Warner Brothers has cut corners in reproducing it. Instead of offering the movie on a single side of the disk, they split it into Side A and Side B.  They didn't have enough integrity to put the movie onto a single side.  In my opinion, this constitutes shoddy production.<br /><br />The movie is 133 minutes in length.  Compare this with \\"A Woman Called Moses\\" of 200 minutes with the entire movie contained on a single side.  Compare it with \\"Elizabeth,\\" a movie of 124 minutes contained on a single side.  Compare it with \\"The Scarlet and the Black,\\" a movie of 156 minutes contained on a single side.  And finally, compare it with \\"Yentl,\\" a movie which contains both the extended cut of the film and the theatrical version of the film, both on a single side.<br /><br />Amazon is most negligent in not providing accurate information about the deficiencies of the Warner Brothers product.  Shame on you.  While this is a GREAT FILM, the Warner Brothers reproduction is woefully inadequate - Caveat Emptor!!!!
0345803485|1.0|A number of my friends loved this book, I heard about it over and over, everywhere I went.  So much so, that I picked it up, despite the fact that it's not my usual type of book. (I love fiction, but generally don't buy books where sex is the main focus of the plot.  That said, I've found a lot of really amazing books by venturing outside my usual, so I was open to it.)<br /><br />One friend, a very bright woman who happens to be a doctor, RAVED about the sex scenes. RAVED.  Like, for ten minutes straight.<br /><br />So I expected to like it a lot, but I just didn't.  The problem for me, was that I just couldn't get over the writing -- so much so that I was distracted and irritated through the first 30 pages pf the book, after which, I just gave up.  A number of other writers I know felt the same way.  That said, I have some very bright, well-read friends who absolutely adored this book.<br /><br />Here's my advice, if you're in it for the steamy sex scenes and clunky writing doesn't irritate you, give it a go. But if bad writing generally prevents you from enjoying an otherwise interesting book, this probably isn't a good pick for you.
B006WPSQVC|5.0|We watched Couragous again, saw it first at a large screen, great movie, great content and enjoyed the drama. Looking forward to watching again.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|really cute game with great graphics and good story line like the movie please consider fixing the downlaod time it is super slow
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love this app because it is like Mario and Mario is my favorite game I hop that every body likes this game and will get the app
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I'm in my mid 50's and I could not put this book down once I started reading it.<br />After reading the free preview, I knew I wanted the Trilogy option. What a great price! I actually read the complete trilogy edition and saw the first movie in less than one week!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Better than I thought it would be. Not as fun as the original but it will do for a free to play game.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game reminds me of the old Mario game. so, its a plus in my book. I really enjoy it and plus its great to play when your bored.
B007HJ84WS|3.0|it was ok, my son liked it much more than I.  It is definitely a guys movie more.  But not upset over purchasing for an evening...
B00466HN6S|3.0|For me as a 21 year old it was a so-so movie but since I'm a babysitter my kids thoroughly enjoyed it and it kept them entertained. Maybe I wasn't such a big fan of it because they showed a lot of things in the previews. Now don't think I'm just a typical 21 year old who only watches dirty movies and that's about it. I still have my inner child I enjoy cartoons and Disney movies but I just thought the movie lacked several things. Personally I think 7 and under will love it but older than that may not like it as much.
1433514818|5.0|Purchased hardcover version for a friend.  According to my friend, the item was delivered on time in new condition. He says it's the best bible, he has ever owned. Everyone that sees the bible has commented on how nice it looks and ask where they could get one.  He said it's easy to read and  format easily understood. He said should have a five star rating.
B004EPZ06G|3.0|I bought this movie without seeing it in the theaters. It was alright. It had some funny parts, but thats about it. It sure isn't a classic like the first one was. And the ending was totally predictable!
0345803485|5.0|Loved the book. Read it in 3 days. It draws you in, much like the Twilight books. I did get tired of the redundancy of some of the words she used, but was able to look past them as I enjoyed the story so much. She herself has said that she isn't the best writer. I would have to agree, in the technical sense, she isn't. Albeit, the story is wonderful. I would recommend to those who like a great romance novel that can read it without analyzing it.
B004LWZW88|5.0|Cute movie! Not really for little ones, a lot of adult humor! It did have a lot of laughs. Not related to Shrek, just had Puss in Boots in it.
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|there is an auto save option. it changes when you change screens. scroll down past the fifth save slot and you'll find it there. great game. love the clear data usage!
B006BG7RI0|5.0|Es una gran película y este es un gran producto. El transfer es espectacular, todos los extras vienen subtitulados y la caja es igual de grande a la versión 70 aniversario de LO QUE EL VIENTO SE LLEVÓ. Estoy muy satisfecho y a riesgo de parecerme al Profesor Hubert Farnsworth de Futurama debo decir: YA NO HACEN PELÍCULAS ASÍ.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Loved the series so I started the books. Thank God, because though the first season was faithful to the book, I am very glad I read the second series before I began to watch the show. The book is endless amounts of suspense and fun. It begins a bit convoluted and hard to follow, but soon the plot falls into place and it is difficult to stop reading.<br /><br />Great character development is GRRM's strength in this series, and he proves that each character has a story and different perspectives to take into account for their behavior. Just when you think you can't hate a character any more, he throws in a twist to make you feel completely different.<br /><br />Can't wait to read the rest!
0596805527|5.0|I simply wanted to say how much David's book has meant to my learning and understanding of Javascript, and programming in general. I had initially tried learning through many free sources online, and while most were very good in tackling specific issues or illustrating solutions to esoteric problems, none gave me the confidence that I was getting a solid foundation in the language, or programming in general.<br /><br />In search of something better, I looked to stackoverflow which constantly recommended David's book. To be honest, I pirated it first. But after the first 3 chapters I went straight to Amazon and bought it, as well as Javascript Patters from Stoyan and Douglas's Crockford book Javascript: the good parts (another big hit on the stackoverflow forums). I was dumbfounded at how easy and clear his book made the language. For the first time, ideas were presented in a logical order, with concepts obviously introduced to build on previous ones.  Concepts I've been told are essential (hoisting, closures, etc) but were intimidating because I'd never seen them in a cohesive narrative, shocked me in how intuitive they actually were when written well and paired with succinct examples.<br /><br />I know this all seems overzealous enough to border on the insincere, but for someone who always had a passion for technology and wanted to create his own, but was beginning to be deterred from it all because I thought it was simply above my grasp, I want to say thank you to David and O'Reilly.<br /><br />They very may well have single-handedly created a new developer, and have dramatically changed my life in the process.<br /><br />Thanks again.
B005EXA8LY|5.0|This is the best CD of the year..... simple as that... Steven Wilson created one of the best progressive rock album in history

B007MJT13E|5.0|Loved the Hunger Games series (books), so naturally since there is so much comparison I had to read/watch Battle Royale before making any assumptions.<br /><br />The movie, though sickening and violent, somehow manages to draw in the audience with the interesting story lines of each character. Sometimes funny and always outrageous, Battle Royale will not be a movie that the viewer soon forgets. You get to know the children as they are taken down one by one, in an emotionally draining effort to understand the psychology of each other.<br /><br />For anyone who loves cinema, Battle Royale is a necessary watch. The mix of suspense, violence, comedy, and drama is utilized to its full extent by the director, who uses perfect timing in each of these categories. Together it creates a cinematic gem, a movie that is disturbing, creepy, sad and even at times a bit funny. It is easy to see why Tarantino loves this movie, as it is obvious he has taken much inspiration from this film.<br /><br />I highly recommend it to any viewer who enjoys the psychological thriller type movie, so long as they can withstand the violence and the basic notion of children in a death match.
B00003CXA2|5.0|Thijs is a fun sad happy uplifting movie that you will never get tired of watching. Do yourself a favor and see this one again. Bought this  for my sixteen year old and she loves it.
0345803485|5.0|I was hesitant at first to begin reading this book.  One of my closest friend had me read a few pages on ibooks, and it did not seem so interesting to me.<br />After hearing it on the radio and pretty much everywhere i decided to give in.<br />Maybe it is because i feel that i can relate/connect with Anastasia because i am only 23 and she is in her early 20's too, but from the moment i began to read, the book was extremely intriguing.  I felt everything that Anastasia felt (except some of the erotic parts), but the point is that the book is so much more than an erotic novel.  It has such a great story behind it.  Book two and three just get even better.  The end of book one just leaves you wanting to read book two, and book three.  This book is mostly about their beginning of the relationship, but in the next books you are truly able to see the characters develop more as certain events occur.<br /><br />I can advise the people that have not enjjoyed it to give it a chance and look at it from a different perspective of just reading an erotic novel, and perhaps you wont regret it.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I honestly think team lava is a really bad company, they always make you buy things with real money.but! however, on this. it's much easier to collect revanue, you don't even have to bug your neghbors and better picture quality, plus on scrat's game you can earn animals that cost acorns! so.  . . by team lava! go gameloft!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love to sit back and play this game. its really fun to watch your town grow into a city.
B0000DZEE3|5.0|I'm not much for words I go by feeling and the chili peppers can pull all of that hidden stuff out of me, and help to release it, thanks guy's for doing what you do.
0439023483|5.0|At first I was a little skeptical about this book, unsure of what it was really about. After reading it though I can honestly say this is one of the best books I have ever read!<br /><br />In he beginning the book was a little slow but once things started to piece together I was completely wrapped up in the story. Katniss Everdeen is more of a role model people should look up to over Brittany Spears, shaving heads is not cool.<br /><br />The book also gives a sort of Twilight kind of love story with Gale and Peeta.  Two men completely wrapped in the girl that is Katniss Everdeen. Both care deeply about her but neither has truly won her heart.<br /><br />The Games tear friends and family apart and the fights go from quick and painless to cruel and heartless. Inside the arena everybody is tested and put on the brink of death, and only the best of the best can survive.
B005GUQIDC|5.0|This artist is a must have for those who like to listen to different styles and are open to giving it some time to grow on you. I also recommend Gotye who she works with also.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|fun fun like samurai and zombies together. just great<br />easy to play don't have to buy any thing to get stronger.
B005EGXTEE|5.0|Read it after I saw all the hype for the film. Absolutely loved it, couldn't put it down. Doesn't feel like a young adult novel, it's mature and thoughtful.
B00006AW63|4.0|The video is in great condition, and delivery was good. I only was taken back by it not being a video of region 1 our region, and either had to send it back or get a multi regional player. As my wifes player had a lot of background noise I chose the latter. However i reccomend asking vendor the region of the video unless you have a multi regional player.
B00004XQ83|5.0|If you loved the movie- O Brother Where Art Thou- then you should get the soundtrack.<br />It will bring all those hilarious moments from the movie right back to mind.
B0034G4P7G|5.0|This is an inspiring movie for anyone interested in entrepreneurship or technology. I highly recommend it because it is both entertaining and insightful.
B003WE9TU8|2.0|I'm fascinated with the idea of Zombie's and usually enjoy Zombie apocolypse fiction but I really couldn't get into this book a all. It was long winded with alot of jargon that I found really hard to follow. There were a couple of good accounts but they were few and far between. Too many real life references that the average person doesn't know about, I found I had to keep flipping to the reference list to get through every second sentence.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|I loved this movie, probably because it is a true story, and so heartwarming..so refeshing..it is one I will watch over and over again..
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|loved the trilogy, cant wait to see the movies couldnt put it down read all 3 in 7 days. kindel is so convinient when on the go.
B007RFJ4QM|3.0|Perhaps confusing changing plans are part of the heist crimes - who would know - but when those rapid sequences changes in plans and personnel are transferred to a film that is supposed to make sense it rarely works. Perhaps this flimsy film made sense in the original film from Iceland called `Reykjav&iacute;k Rotterdam' which starred the director of this film, Baltasar Korm&aacute;kur, in the main role, but Aaron Guzikowski's adaptation of that film written by Arnaldur Indriðason and &Oacute;skar J&oacute;nasson leaves so many holes and covers information with fast talking and loud visual and audio effects that the audience is pretty much let to its own concludions about whether or not to care about anyone or any thing in CONTRABAND. As the main character Chris Farrady (Mark Wahlberg) states `I've got to try and fix this. Trust me, I know what I'm doing.'  Well, that didn't work....<br /><br />As the condensed plot summary goes, `Chris Faraday (Wahlberg) once smuggled illegal items or contraband into the country on freighters. He left that life behind, got married has a wife (Kate Bekinsale) family and went legit. But when his brother-in-law Andy (Caleb Landry Jones) got involved with Briggs (a tattooed and smarmy Giovanni Ribisi), a drug dealer and when he blew a deal, Briggs demands restitution which he can't deliver. So Chris offers to find a way to pay him but the he threatens Chris' family if he doesn't deliver. So he gets on a freighter destined for Panama with his friend Danny (Lukas Haas) and he sets out to bring back some counterfeit currency. Briggs \\"goes to see\\" Chris' family. When Chris learns of this he asks his friend Sebastian (Ben Foster) to take care of them - big mistake.... He tells Chris that it would be better to bring drugs instead of the cash. The captain of the freighter (J.K. Simmons) is on the take and the strange weirdo dealer in Panama is Gonzalo (Diego Luna). Every other minute plans change and the bulk of the film is devoted to hide and seek and violence.<br /><br />With all the writers and scripts available it I always amazing how such fine actors as Kate Bekinsale, Ben Foster, Giovanni Ribisi, JK Simmons, Diego Luna and Mark Wahlberg can sign on to be a part of a film such as this.  Completely forgettable movie despite some very fine actors. Maybe the Icelandic version was better.

0399536108|5.0|I absolutely loved the book.  The recession has really caused me take a step back and figure out what I want in life.  I'm tired of possessions owning me.  I'm tire of my job owning me.  I want a different life than what I've had.  I want a 'quality' life that brings me happiness.  This book totally motivated me to go get that life.  His blog is great as well.  I bought ten copies of this book and gave them to my friends.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|My little boy absolutely loves this movie. There was a few (rainy) weeks where he watched it everyday. Even after all that repetition, I actually wasn't sick of it...and I usually can't stand anything animated. For those parents who want a great kid's movie that won't drive you nuts, it's priceless!
B007X15DBK|5.0|Just when you think that Bones can't get better, it does. Booth's son Parker returns and misunderstandings ensue. Hodgins madcap escapades (a must see for all fans of Hodgins!!!) All the usual LYAO fun and mischief all while solving an intriguing murder case...Enjoy!
B004W2UBYW|5.0|A well researched piece about one of the greatest entrepreneurs in American history. It is a comprhensive non-sugar coated objective insight into Steve Jobs life and career. A must read!
B0050DIWFC|1.0|Bought this based on reader reviews. Overall I found this book to be tedious and amateurish. Number of errors indicating the author didn't do his homework, eg. 'clamming' on the South shore of Lake Superior? Oh, yeah like that ever happened.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I had bought the hardcover trilogy for my wife a couple months before the movie came out but never really had any intentions of reading them myself.  I just couldn't get over the Young Adult category that these books are thrown into.  I wasn't about to waste my time on kids stuff.  But after I took her to see the first movie I decided to give it a try because the story was pretty intriguing and the movie definitely put to rest the notion of this material being kids stuff.  I quickly caught up to her and ended up purchasing the Kindle edition just to keep going.  I can't remember the last time I was so hooked on a story.  I finished all 3 books in less than 3 weeks which is pretty impressive given my busy schedule this past month.  The only thing \\"Young Adult\\" about these books is probably the writing style.  It's well written but in a simple and easy to understand sort of way.
B004UXUX4Q|5.0|I purchase the DVD as a gift...I cannot believe the turnaround time on the purchase. The only way to get a product faster than this would be to reach through the computer screen
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|its fun and I love it. its easy to do and don't have to wait all day for more energy refill.
1416914285|5.0|I absolutely loved this book and the whole series. Loved the characters, the plot, the language, the whole thing. In fact, I've loved everything I've ever read so far by Cassandra Clare and hope she keeps writing. Not many authors can write like her. Excellent read.
B0077PBPJ6|5.0|I watched the first half of this two part series on television on Sunday night in HD (it was beautiful) and the second half after I rented the dvd.  The first part is now available through 5/22 on the PBS website.<br />I also watched all 3 short extra feature documentaries.<br />This is a wonderful film, however it should be noted that there are several fairly graphic war scenes and several scenes with sexuality.<br /><br />The three short documentary featurettes are also worth watching.  One addresses the love story, one addresses the war story and the third featurette discusses the behind the scenes filming.  The movie was filmed in part in Budapest, Hungary.  The actors, director, producer and costume designer all speak warmly and intensely of their involvement in the production.<br /><br />This film is a not-to-be-missed Masterpiece theatre two-part series.  If you have read the book, you will find some differences.  I won't go into detail, since I have not read the book as of yet (I have skimmed through it), but one major difference is that the 1970's part of the novel is not included in the film.  That is probably no great loss, since many readers felt that this part of the book was not necessary.<br /><br />Clemence Poesy (Isabelle Azaire) is stunning and Eddie Redmayne (Stephen) is also captivating.  The juxtaposition of a love story and the historically realistic gut-wrenching story of the loyalty and comraderie among soldiers in the tunnels of France in WWI makes for a very solid plot.<br /><br />The second half of this series will be presented on many PBS Stations on Sunday evening, April 29th.  It's well worth a look!<br /><br />I will add more to this review at a later date.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|graphics<br />characters<br /><br />5 stars!!!!!!<br /><br />sweet zombies lol enjoying stab them.<br /><br />the best game on kf so far. well done glu guys
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|Loved this book.  It was different than other King books I've read. Have heard JFK conspiracy theories and thought this would just be another one but since it was King I thought I'd give it a chance.  It was extremely enjoyable and I couldn't put it down.
0545265355|5.0|I purchased the trilogy for our family because the waiting list at our local library was too long.  They arrived quickly, and were as advertised.  This set is excellent reading for anyone, not just for teenagers.  The readers at our house range from teenage to 66, & we all enjoyed the books.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|It's so wonderful to have all these resources on my tablet! I refer to it often and it's so easy to use.
0743454537|1.0|It is a mediocre book, at best.  The plot lines are not credible.  The characters one dimensional.  The only thing this book has going for it is an interesting ethical dilemma.  And then at the end, there is a plot twist that completely takes the dilemma away.  I feel like I was tricked into wasting part of my life on this stupid book.  Don't waste your time.
B00340ESIS|5.0|A friend of mine recommended the Save The Cat books to me and at first I thought that they wouldn't interest me since I write books/stories and not screenplays.  How wrong I was.  Since reading the first one I've now gone on to buy the rest of Snyder's books.  They have become my Holy Grail of writing books for the way he helps you construct a story and I refer to them over and over again.<br /><br />I used to think I was strictly a panster (write by the seat of your pants) when it came to writing, but now I know that a good story needs that structure to take it to the next level.<br /><br />I don't think I could ever write another story now without checking my beats to make sure it flows well.<br /><br />Thank you Blake Snyder (and God Bless).

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Fast download of the best trilogy written. Read all three in record time. Exciting energetic thrilling. This author captured the ability to bring you into the story.  Can't wait for the movies to hit the theaters.
B007R41E8O|5.0|it was the best mystery and puzzle game yet and ever played it had way more steps to finishing than the others
B000002H70|5.0|My friend recommended Disintegration to me a few months back. I didn't like it at first - I thought it was boring orchestral/rock music for 60 minutes. With every listen however, it has come to grow on me. This is now one of my most listened-to albums. My friend had the same exact experience too. So don't worry if Disintegration sits in the backburner of your to-listen. Just give it several more go's and I guarantee you will be hooked.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Simple controls with plenty of options. I would say it contains the minimum features a successful game is required to. Play!!
B000083E79|5.0|\\"The Very Best of Cher\\" contains some classic songs that have been popular radio staples.  \\"The Shoop Shoop Song\\", \\"Half Breed\\", and \\"I Got You Babe\\" are some of the hits featured on this cd.  I was surprised that \\"Love and Understanding\\" was missing from this collection.  Nonetheless, \\"The Very Best of Cher\\" is great to get for anyone who enjoys at least one of Cher's songs.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|i literally cant put this game down it is that addictive im glued to my kindle screen. GET THIS GAME!
0439023521|4.0|Suzanne Collins' \\"The Hunger Games\\" is unique in that is equally enjoyable to all age groups.  My son, niece, nephew, and mother all read their copies as I read mine, and I'm planning to go see the movie as soon as my 16-year-old finishes the last page.<br /><br />Set in the future in the South, The Hunger Games are a scarey take on reality shows.  The twelve districts all draw two names of children (between the ages of 9 and 18, if I remember correctly) to fight to death against one another.  There are no rules.  Though there is obviously much death involved, I didn't find the descriptions to be overly gory.  The strategies the players came up with were very interesting and ranged from all out warfare to passive aggressive hide-and-sneak.<br /><br />As these 24 kids fight it out in the wilderness, every move is televised, just like the fanfare that preceeded the start of the event.<br /><br />I would recommend this book for anyone looking for a new take on an unpredictable action-adventure/fantasy.  The only thing I wasn't fond of was the last few paragraphs, which were a bit contrived to build interest in Book 2.  I did really like the way the story ended, other than that.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|I started playing when I was 5 and stopped playing at 14 it is really fun. you have to play it
B0076HN4G2|5.0|If you like this Broadway show, you will totally enjoy this special 25 year commemoration at the Royal Albert.  Almost as good as actually being at the original performance.  Equally as awesome as the anniversary one done there for Les Miserables!!!  Everyone who likes Broadway shows should have both of these on Blu-Ray.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I enjoy playing this game. the only thing I don't like is the random things that come up that you have to pay real money for or have your town damaged
1250008409|4.0|\\"Get Some Headspace:  Ten Minutes to Calm Through Meditation\\" by Andy Puddicombe teaches simple techniques to introduce the reader to meditation.  The author is a Buddist monk, so who better to write on the subject.  He explains the principles along with what to and not to expect, as well as the benefical outcome of practicing meditation every day.  It's written as if the author is speaking directly to the reader, and dashes of humor make even more fun.<br /><br />His website includes 10 free audio mediation sessions which I'm finding very helpful as I try to get into the 10 minute habit.
0812550757|4.0|The first chapter had me glued, and then it was a roller coaster of not wanting t put the book down.  Overall, it wasn't as good as Ender's Game but was a pretty good book.  Hoping the rest of the series doesn't go down hill from here.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|really liked this game until it stopped working. all my businesses animals and crops timers have reset to 480 hours and continues to reset every time I open the game. I have no way of making money or harvesting food now which is the whole idea of the game. not to mention my energy no longer accumulates while I'm not actively playing so now the game is totally unplayable and worthless.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like it very very very very very very very much much much much much much much much a lot lot
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This book was very captivating from the beginning to the end! I would recommend this to anyone looking for a little excitement, surprise, and romance!!
0812550706|5.0|This book had me glued to it.  Stayed up many a nights just to try and find a spot where I could put it down, but just couldn't.  Everything about this book is awesome.  Hopefully the movie doesn't ruin it.
B007V5CF5K|5.0|I enjoyed this game so far and I am only 1/3 through it. The download time was long, but that's expected with some of the better games. I give 5 stars, keep these type of games coming! Remember, Thou Shalt Not Whine!!!
1575666286|5.0|Interesting information and very useful. My husband has cancer and this book has made him feel as if he had control.
0345803485|1.0|Stay away!  This is a soap opera, not erotica.<br /><br />SPOILERS FOLLOW........<br /><br />Is book was, to me, the opposite of BDSM fantasy. By the end of the trilogy, the couple is married, Ana is pregnant, and Christian has all but given up BDSM. It is revealed that the only reason he originally entered the scene was because he was an abused, abandoned child who was adopted, then at the age of fifteen, drafted into a D/s relationship with a much older woman (interpreted by me, and thankfully Ana, as molestation and statutory rape). Ana never seems to dig the scene outside of very mild bondage and a couple of spanks. The longer the book drags on, the less exciting the couple's sex becomes as Ana vanillas Christian down with the enchanting power of her boring but somehow life-changing love.<br /><br />The book teases hardcore BDSM fans by presenting Christian's room of toys and gear, then almost never uses it. Ana is scared of everything, and not adventurous-scared. Just scared-scared. She says she likes being spanked, but then usually tries to avoid it. She's naive to the point of being unbelieveable, but somehow also instantly transforms from a virgin who has never touched herself to a multi-orgasm-having sex goddess. Christian has a nasty temper outside the bedroom and Ana is always afraid he is going to yell at her. At one point, she seems to fear that Christian will not respect her use of their safe word. The one time she really should use the safe word, she \\"forgets\\" and ends up getting beaten with a belt when she doesn't want to be. Not sexy. It doesn't feel like a trusting relationship.<br /><br />Overall, the message of the books seems to be that you can change a man to be exactly what you want just by loving him enough. I picked this up expecting some breezy erotica and instead ended up with some romantic drivel, an ill-conceived kidnapping plot (really!), and a happily-ever-after marriage and pregnancy. A few of the encounters are sexy, but in all, thisbook does not earn a spot in the fiddle folder.<br /><br />From a technical standpoint, the writing is incredibly repetitive. Ana uses \\"holy crap\\" to the point that it's just irritating. For someone supposedly interested in literature, she doesn't have a very varied vocabulary. The sex scenes start to feel repetitive, and that's never a good thing in erotica.
B004EPYZV2|1.0|Nothing will ever make me believe that Tom can do the impossible. He should have been in a wheel chair by now paralyzed.  This movie is unbelievably foolish at best and that's putting it nicely. The only interesting character in the film was the woman assassin. And even she didn't have along enough time to save this cliche'. This is a perfect example of what American cinema has been reduced to. To watch someone walk through everything untouched takes suspension of disbelief. The whole car scene was just ridiculous at the end and how he walked out of it. If you want to see a good movie that's unique watch \\"DRIVE\\".
B007CKNX28|5.0|Right from the start, Blunderbuss grabbed this listener & sucked me into each of the 13 musical stories, presented on it. The production & recording quality - brilliant, courtesy of Jack's Nashville, Third Man Studio (pictured on the back cover of the CD) & in your face, but incredibly warm & rich, reminding me of the well recorded classic rock records, from the sixties & seventies, all the while capturing a totally modern American Rock singer/songwriter. I love the keyboards tastefully flowing through so many tracks & Jack's guitar playing rips. There is an incredible depth to the songs here, with so many of his influences showing, from sixties surf guitar rock & soul, classic country (not today's pop crap), through early British rock'n'roll, to gritty down south blues. Immediate standout tracks for this listener, included the rockin' \\"Sixteen Saltines\\" with some great scorching guitar, the old Nashville country waltz of \\"Blunderbuss\\" with it's wonderful pedal steel work, the Beatlesque vocal harmonies floating through: \\"On & On & On\\", to the smokin' blues of the classifc \\"I'm Shakin'\\", there is something to grab everyone here. If I have one complaint, it's that the songs are a bit short, with only two clocking in at slightly over 4 minutes, the rest being between 2 to 3. This listener wanted them to go - on & on & on. :)<br />Needless to say, this record is getting alot of repeat play & should be in all Rock collections.<br />I look forward to more solo releases from Jack White, this one is a brilliant way to start!
