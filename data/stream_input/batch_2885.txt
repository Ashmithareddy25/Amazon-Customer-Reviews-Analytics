B004DM1ZQY|5.0|If you enjoy backgammon you will enjoy this app.  I find that even though I have many games installed I always return to this game.  It doesn't have any glitches that need to be updated, it runs smoothly and is very easy to use.  I definitely recommend this app.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|This is a good cd that needs to be in everyone's collection. Adele is going to be one of my favorites.

B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Always kept me guessing what would happen next.  Very entertaining.  I liked the way kept moving and never seemed to stall.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|My husband and I enjoyed watching this movie.  It was Very entertaining.  The special effects were also good,  Sammuel L. Jackson was so good, he was almost believable.
B005LAIIJY|4.0|I really liked how Tarantino created a modern day western with roots in the spaghetti westerns of the 70's.  Everything was cool and hip; Foxx and DiCaprio were stellar in their performances, but the supporting actor, Christopher Waltz pretty much stole the show.  Plenty of gratuitous violence and blood splattering, but somehow not &#34;over the top&#34; as in many of Tarantino's other works.  This is one worth watching again.
B000063V8T|5.0|This is a must have for a real Star Trek fan. It's HD and has extras as well. Nothing more needed.

B00DHSK3RM|5.0|If you dont want to keep playing a game then stay away from Candy Crush because once you start you can't stop yourself.  I hate gaming but this game has me now wanting to play it 24/7...........Yikes and I am well past 55yrs old...

B00D8HNR2K|5.0|This is hands down one of NIN's best albums. Simply put it's stellar. All the albums since the fragile have been of lesser quality in my opinion. Trent really has grown as a song writer and it shows on this album. There isnt a bad track here which is rare for a NIN album. The sonic mastery on this album is unrivaled. What trent has done with sonic layers and atmosphere on this album is masterful. I wasnt expecting this album to be as good as it is. Fantastic work Trent. My respect for you as an artist is now greater.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|great amazing movie must see. expecially in 3d. this was one of my favorite movies. seeing it in2d doesnt to it justcie you have to see it in 3d.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|My kids love this version of Temple Run.  I tend to stick with the original, but they love this one.  It is really funny to watch them play.  And I think it helps their hand eye coordination with how you have to turn and jump/duck.  Good game!

B004MC8CA2|5.0|One of the best things I love about this, is how easy it is to switch to a different book in the Bible.  I also love how you can switch translations in seconds- whereas I only have 1 version in a physical edition.  This is a wonderful resource, and the free studies are awesome!  Highly recommend!!

B0067Q42BY|5.0|Great for killing time. It is actually a little challenging but more than anything it is just good when you are looking to kill time.
B002VX3RCW|5.0|I have yet to have my child play with it but it is totally adorable and can't wait to have my baby.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|All too often these days, movies are a disappointment. Thid one had me glued to the chair the whole time, like I knew it would.

B00EEDJM2Q|4.0|I really like this game. Challenges my brain .  Love it. I would recommend this to others for a fun game to play.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so much fun. It's way better than subway surfers and temple run. I like how you can buy outfits for the minions.
B001KL0WJW|5.0|An Awesome story of gangs from the 70's in New York! Very entertaining! Leaves you rooting for the BAD GUYS for a change! Highly recommended!

B005LLSZNM|5.0|The MC world is not always blood and death! Kurt Sutter has brought the voyeur in us all the inside of what sometimes happens in the MC world and life style! Check it out you know you want to!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|The good:  Start with the low price.  Next, it does a great job with Netflix and You Tube.  Fills the TV screen with clear video and audio.  If that's all you want, buy this instead of the more costly Apple TV.  Finally, set up was a breeze via my iPad.  Set up via PC requires Chrome browser (see below).<br /><br />The bad:  Chrome browser is a disaster.  Can't hold a candle to Firefox or Internet Explorer.  That is why you are well advised to use your iPhone or iPad for Chromecast setup.  But you need to use Chrome browser to get anything beyond Netflix and You Tube to stream to your TV.  Even without streaming Chrome is unstable, some of the time simply won't open without a reboot, and when it plays Amazon Prime Instant Video it takes several tries to get the video to play and when it does the picture is only in a corner of the screen when you go to full screen view.  That carries over to your TV screen when you stream it.  And because by default Amazon Instant Video uses Silverlight, which is not supported by Chromecast, I could not stream Amazon videos at all until I changed to the Flash plug-in in the Chrome browser, which is supported to a degree.<br /><br />The future:  Streaming via the Chrome browser is a beta function.  Hopefully Google will improve this in the future, which will extend the capacity of Chromecast beyond Netflix and You Tube.
0345525558|5.0|I know it will be interesting as my bookclub recommended it. I haven't read it yet.Thank you for asking for my input.
B00E8B1P9M|1.0|This has got to be the worst movie of the decade. They just signed a bunch of big names, added CGI, and slapped an iconic 80's brand name on it .... I guess that's how stupid Hollywood thinks people are nowadays. I didn't care who won or lost, I didn't care about any of the characters, story line is weak with holes big enough to drive a Mack truck through. What's sad is this was a sequel to an already bad movie, but this time around they spent more money to bungle it up even more. Just disgusting.
B00B52FDXQ|4.0|Great series too bad it had to end.  Starz could have continued the story with Crassus or Caesar or even Pompey.  They could have followed the surviving members of the rebellion.  INSTEAD they went to a total flop Devinci's Demons...  Might as well not even watch Starz now.
B0095P31L6|2.0|The cute demeanor of the idea behind this movie was enticing, but IN NO WAY should've been viewed with a 5 year old.  Some foul language and menacing threat sequences really made it too rough for young audiences.  It would be better as an acid-trippy wrag-tag, wanna-be hero that Depp normally plays.  Not in cartoon mode tho.  Really contemplated making this a 1 Star.
1401233791|5.0|This book contains the back story for Bane, which is amazing. I definitely recommend for any batman fans or new comers to the series.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|Very addicting. I got all the way through the 100 levels. It was maddening, frustrating, infuriating, and exhilarating. Can't wait to do it all again!
B00B4FU6KE|5.0|As I said in my review title, this book makes you think about what it means to be human, in more ways than one. The most obvious way it does so is by inviting comparison between chimpanzees and humans, because the main human character was raised with a chimp during her early developmental years. Now an adult, we hear her story in retrospect, and her contemporary family and friend drama invites more exploration of what it means to be human - how we connect, how we don't, and how social constructs and expectations shape both. Of course, there is also the theme of animal abuse, and what responsibility we have as caretakers of other species. But to say that makes this novel sound too pedantic, which it's not. It's a good read, and beautifully written. When you put all that together, you definitely get 5 stars!!
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Great cinematography, in a spaghetti western way. Kept me interested throughout! Hope you enjoy it as much as I did
B00DHHWYAW|4.0|Based on the mostly poor critical reviews I had read of this film, I was expecting to really dislike it. However, once I allowed myself to simply let go of any of my own images I had from having the read the book long ago, I really came to like it. The sets and style are completely over the top, as in Baz Luhrman's Moulin Rouge, but I felt it worked in this film, to display the excess of pre-depression New York. I loved Leo Dicaprio as Gatsby and Joel Edgarton as Buchanon, and everyone else is strong too (these were just the two standouts for me.) I didn't love all of the artistic choices Luhrman made - I felt the contemporary music didn't always work - but I was mostly enthralled, and the choices engendered discussion between my husband and I. And I certainly appreciated that it was something different and definitive - that it had a definite viewpoint. In that sense, it certainly stayed true to Fitzgerald, even if not in every detail. Watch it as a unique artistic expression, and not as a novel come to life, and you will appreciate it more.
0345803485|1.0|there are more interesting and well written harlequin books... decided to give book a try to see what the fuss was all about. can't understand the hype...
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|My husband and I enjoy sci-fi, and so we enjoyed this post-apocalyptic film, in which Tom Cruise plays a pilot assigned to earth - along with his companion/flight operator/wife - to maintain drones and eradicate any remaining rebels, as the few real survivors of the earth's destruction are now living off-planet. His discovery of a sleeping survivor in a pod crash who, once awakened, claims to have been asleep for 60 years and to have known him before, causes him to question all he once believed. Tom Cruise is excellent - he is best in these intense end-is-near kind of roles - and the images of the destroyed earth are absolutely enthralling in a can't-look-away kind of way. However, the story twists and turns a lot, and we weren't always sure we were exactly following every twist. But it's a good action sci-fi if that's what you are after.
B000FC130E|4.0|Great vision and expertly written supernatural fantasy - - Super characters and superb story line - - not up to the extraordinary quality of &#34;American Gods&#34; - in my opinion - - but every Gaiman novel is worth waiting for!!!
159448385X|4.0|The description of the area and the contrast in the way the rich and the poor lived is interesting. I found the jump from past to present to past for the different characters very difficult to follow. I was happy that the sister was reunited with her brother but sad that he coouldn't remember her due to Alsheimers.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|Wonderfully done supernatural techno-thriller with some great history interwoven into the story.  Rollins' Sigma Force novels and characters are first class!!
B009IF8CH6|5.0|i love this show, i missed this season when it was on tv. it was great being able to watch it on my ipad
B00003CWRX|4.0|I like the movie because for the most part it stuck together (coherent). It's was not like a lot of today's movie that go out of the way to shock you.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I have loved my little pony for a long time and this game is just addicting its so fun. the mini games are awsome but the price of some pony with crystals are a bit much I mean 50$ for some crystals to get the princes is over kill. ut still love the game
B004TTZHBK|5.0|Great book and excellent recipes. Don't care for the Cover. Could be a little more informational. Well worth the price.
B003Z0BWR2|4.0|This is a series of books which rival that of twilight.  3 way love interest with Simon and jace.  Who will Clary end up with and is Valentine really dead??  I am glad to see we may meet Clary's mum in the next book and hear her story.  Will Luke tell her how he really feels?<br />All questions hopefully to be answered in the next book.
B00DRPVE3M|1.0|hope they find out what's wrong I'm losing coins and . Points I don't buy any thing but I had 75 level now I have none everything was erase

B0064TVQ5E|3.0|love the game, but not enough room on my phone. When I switch to another phone-I plan on downloading the app. again .
B00D6QU6RW|5.0|It's been a while since the last real BSB sounding album has come out. I bought this album a week before seeing them in concert to get familiar with the new music. I haven't stopped playing it since and that was a month ago! I definitely didnt realize how much I missed the BSB sound until getting this album. The single, In A World Like This, is exactly what you want from BSB. Amazing harmonies! I'm also a fan of Madeleine, Trust Me, and Soldier. Their music is a little old and a little new. Love it!
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|Wonderful film about a famous recording studio in Van Nuys, CA that became famous (and infamous) for the many amazing recordings done there and for being a very, very messy and &#34;casual&#34; place of business. Great interviews, great memorabilia, and some super recording sessions, ending up with Paul McCartney creating a new song in the studio. Fabulous film.
0553801473|5.0|I got into it because of the tv show and decided to read them all.  I am so happy I did.  People like to compare to Lord of the Rings but I think it is a more realistic approach to fantasy worlds.  Not for kids just like the show.  Love this book and am ready for the next.
B003UESJEM|4.0|This movie wasn't too bad.  It had good actors, a decent plot, etc.  I'd definitely be willing to watch it again.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I Finished this in two days on Aruba bc I couldn't put it down...and I'm not usually an avid reader
B004H83IM8|5.0|We already have the first 2 Austin Powers movies on VHS and we thought we had all 3, but somehow the 3rd one disappeared.  We like to have complete sets of movies with sequels.  When I saw this collection, I had to get it.  Somehow it's harder to lose a movie that's in a set.  These movies are funny, sick and downright right gross at times, but the humor is what keeps us watching them.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|This is going to come in very handy with our Wisconsin winters.  I love the features that come with it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. What I enjoyed the most was the suspense at the end of each chapter, luring you into the next. I will recommend this book to anyone who is into action/drama/romance books
014241543X|2.0|I found a review for this book in an article, and the context piqued my interest. As another reviewer pointed out efficiently, the characters fall flat in this tale with an ending that collapses upon itself. It wasn't until after I had wasted several hours that I could have spent shredding old income tax papers or buttering toast that I turned the book back to it's cover and read, ominously above the title, \\"Will appeal to fans of Stephanie Miller's TWILIGHT\\" - USA Today.<br /><br />I was hit by a boulder, and it's marking was \\"WHY?!\\" One of the positive reviews I encountered raved about the overwhelming sadness evoked by this book. Clearly, this individual has been raised by kittens.<br /><br />Please, do not waste your time. Sew buttons on that old army coat, make waffles from scratch, or read something of sustenance.<br /><br />Footnote: The ending? As much as we all love to see Bambi emerge from the forest fire unscathed, I work in the ICU, and the grasp reflex is primitive, exhibited by individuals with severe brain injuries that are generally fatal. If only such were the case for Mia.
B00846REIS|3.0|I didn't really like it. I read it because I had enjoyed fifty shades of grey, but it didn't have the same magic.
B005PK1G76|5.0|great quality for the price, attaches with velcro easily to a stroller, fabric sturdy, hold a bottle, keys and room for other items
B0009ZHJ7S|5.0|Robots is a uper cute movie.  My two years loves to watch it over and over. I enjoy watching it as well so bonus!
B007EC27QM|5.0|Easy to use.  Many features.  Great layout and user interface.  I had tried several other calculator apps and my search is over.  This is the calculator for me!
B009XHAM8G|5.0|This is by far my 3yr olds favorite book! I recommend this for young children of all ages. Truly shows a mother's love is long lasting.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Awesome movie, great soundtrack, love it all! Love that this had the digital copy as well. Boyfriend gift that I will be watching with him:).
B0014NDXGA|4.0|I like this product but you have to have a pretty steady hand.  It has definitely improved my game knowing exactly how far I need to hit the ball.  The first one that I received had no battery and was obviously a used unit.  Amazon was quick to send me a new one and overnighted it to me.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|This app has been very accurate for me, it's the only weather app I like to use on my kindle for
B00BGIBVRG|2.0|I was SO excited when I saw the previews for this movie and I love the cast. However, my husband and I didn't even finish watching it as it was so.....blah!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Loved it! Well written. Great characters. Good story. Even a few unexpected twists and surprises. Laughed, cried and stayed up way past my bedtime to read just a few more pages. This is one book deserving of it's high ratings and positive reviews. Recommend with complete confidence.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Good scifi. Somewhat predictable at points. I had read a review about how it is like several scifi plots all rolled into one. And yeah it was but still enjoyed it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I liked everything about this book; the setting, the characters, the story written beautifully all wanted me to ignore anything else I had to do and just keep reading.<br />Well done-:)
B005V5WBFG|5.0|Works well for my needs on my tablet no complaints so far I will continue to explore the aspects of the product
B0049P1N3K|5.0|Awesome book!  More detail for what was in the first book The Secret!  Love it!  My life is changing for the better!
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|If you are trying to teach how a person can work for months and lose it all in an instant, this the game for you.  I'm on my second game (had to delete my first one) and start from scratch.  Now when I purchase pearls the charge comes out of my bank account but doesn't get credited to my game.  Good luck getting Desney to get back to you to solve the problem.
B001BANK32|4.0|After watching the classic movie I knew I needed to read the book and see how it REALLY went down at the Overlook. I must say it was so much more thrilling and full of depth. I hated being there, with Jack, as the hotel took over. He held on as long as he could but the forces at work were far too strong. I really enjoyed reading The Shining. It dragged sometimes and Kings imagination is...something else. Sometimes too far out there. Or not far enough? Either way I will definitely be reading Doctor Sleep soon.
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|I love BBC America... and so trusted that this was going to be good. It is fabulous, and I blew through the whole first season in 3 watchings.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|I needed something for my Kindle.  I didn't need anything fancy, mostly adding and subtracting with a little division and multiplication sprinkled in. It functions perfectly.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|It was an exeptional movie, well worth the cost, but it wasn't the greatest movie that I have seen. Perhaps I will watch it some time on a better television with a better sound system.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I think the word he's searching for is EVIDENCE, not PROOF.  But NDE stories always are intriguing, as evidence of an afterlife calms our fears about this transition we call death.<br /><br />For actual, physical evidence (but still not proof) of an afterlife, read a new Native American classic called CRAZY HORSE APPEARING.  It's a bio of his life, with an authentic photo (so they say) of Crazy Horse.  The Introduction provides the evidence I am talking about.  People who find themselves moved by this book should definitely read that one. Crazy Horse Appearing is available as an ebook for $3.99.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0989143635 Crazy Horse Appearing]]
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Quality of broadcast was great.  Wish I could have watched it on my Android tablet.  But my widescreen PC monitor worked great.
B002FQOI0A|5.0|It was not at all like I thought it was going to be like but it was amazing. It was a great book
B001KVZ6G6|4.0|I purchased this as a gift having seen the movie on cable.  I had fairly low expectations but was pleasantly surprised.  The movie starts a bit slow, but the characters develop nicely.  The humor and story fall along the lines of &#34;Grumpy Old Men,&#34; a comparison meant as a compliment rather than a criticism.  The story lapses into silliness at times, but the overall work is solid enough to hold an adult's interest.
140006922X|4.0|It was Freud who stated, \\"Every religion bears the imprint of the times in which it arose.\\" With the same understanding Aslan sets out to make the case that the orthodox Christian religion as we know it was mostly developed by Hellenized (Rome-assimilated) Jews who had radically reinterpreted and revised the words and stories told about Jesus of Nazareth to fit a spiritualized ideology that would give the disenfranchised and crushed Jews hope, while being more palatable to a Roman world-audience. The way Aslan sees it, Jesus was a man, a Jew, who began a resistance against Rome, but ultimately failed and was crucified; but his noble deeds, along with a grain of scandal about his resurrection, renewed the Jewish confidence in their religion enough to convince others like Paul that there was enough unrealized potential in the old ideas, assuming some editorial work, to inspire new generations.  It doesn't matter how you piece the Bible puzzle together...there are plenty of extra/missing pieces either way. Aslan breaks apart the orthodox Christian jigsaw, reshuffles the pieces, and then reassembles following his new picture-on-the-box of Jesus as man and Jewish revolutionary. And he doesn't do a bad job at all. There still seem to be pieces left over (like Jesus stating \\"my kingdom is not of this world\\", Jn 18:36), which Aslan does his level-best at explaining away, but not nearly so many leftover pieces as would completely and utterly allay the concerns of evangelical Christians. The apologist William Lane Craig's brazen flippancy may have betrayed more concern than he'd like to admit when he said that there was nothing new in Aslan's work that hasn't already been disproven long ago. Looks like someone told Craig one too many times that the other kids are `just jealous'.    The Author's Note and Introduction in the book does a fantastic job of laying out the author's basic claims, and will probably be satisfying to a person wondering what the big deal about this bookis (of course, you have to see the video to really understand the author's recent rise in notoriety:[...]. If a person is mildly open to his thesis, or insanely opposed enough to slurp his errors like blood, the rest of the book delivers the goods as well. At the end of his introduction Aslan even throws a bone to people of faith who can't swallow his premise, \\"The quest for the historical Jesus is ultimately an internal quest.\\" That would have been nice, but then he goes on to say, somewhat contradictorily, \\"But in the end, [Jesus as man and revolutionary] is the only Jesus that we can access by historical means. Everything else is a matter of faith.\\" Sounds pretty, but it's mildly patronizing when you really look at it. It's tantamount to a `too-bad-so-sad' sort of concession for his believing critics. I guess he figured they don't like him anyway.    As a whole, it was good. I liked it. The first sentence of the book was killer. No, really. \\"The war with Rome begins not with a clang of swords but with the lick of a dagger drawn from an assassin's cloak.\\" Yesssssss. Throughout the work Aslan employs compelling historical analysis, but he really drives his best points home with good storytelling. Here, in history, was a people faced with impossible odds, who courageously managed to keep their noses above water to survive the brutal conditions of human oppression at the hands of the `civilized' Romans. In Aslan's view, this brave struggle is too often eclipsed by Christianity's concept of a Divine Messiah who can't `really' die and is actually God himself. He believes it dilutes the story of frail and mortal people bravely taking risks and hazarding their families, life, and welfare for principles like freedom and faith. Jesus as God is not a hero. He is, well, God. He can't quite feel the despair that humans feel, no matter how theology tries to `save' his humanity from his all-invading divinity. He can't quite be overpowered as humans can, can't experience self-doubt, can't wrestle with personal guilt, and can't quite waver on the fence between good and evil. Granted, by billions, the story of Jesus as God is important for its own obvious reasons, or how could it have swallowed whole this other failed Jewish messiah that was part of the end of an age? But you have to admit, Aslan has a point. No matter where you stand on the religious/irreligious spectrum, we all can admit that narratives of the painful groping of humankind to find the light, resist evil, act bravely, and love deeply need to be told out from under the shadow of a \\"God-fixes-all-our-problems\\" sort of a bully-theology (`bully-ology'?).    One of the most important keys to understanding Aslan's premise is really securing in your mind the chronology of events and zeitgeist as he presents them. Here they are, having been regurgitated by my brain with the most significant events and ideas as I understood them.    Regarding the political history of the Jews:    1. There were a lot of people claiming to be messiah back in the day. Jesus was only one of many. Palestine was awash in apocalyptic expectation and messianic fervor.  2. Rome was constantly suppressing rebellions, and crucifying the movement's leaders as an example. Jesus was a zealot who had admirable political aspirations, but whose courageous strategy to free Rome ultimately failed. He was known as a miracle worker (as were others), made himself out to be a political deliverer (the Messiah), but was crucified as state criminal in 30-33 CE.  Something happened (which the author doesn't scrutinize) which caused the disciples to believe he had resurrected.  3. In 66 A.D. the Jews, under the command of the temple captain Eleazar, revolted against Rome, and actually won Jerusalem back for a time (4 years!).  4. Rome dispatched a band of soldiers, but it wasn't large enough, so they were quickly defeated, which boosted Jewish morale.  5. Nero sent Vespasian and his son Titus in 68 CE to overthrow the revolt once and for all. He quickly subdued surrounding areas and they surrounded Jerusalem with 60,000 men.  6. News of Nero's suicide reached Vespasian, who forthwith left with his army to lay claim to the throne.  7. With Vespasian as the new emperor, he sent his son Titus to take Jerusalem.  8. Jerusalem had been fighting amongst itself in a series of small civil wars with several leaders claiming to be the new messiah.  9. Titus took his time, re-conquered surrounding areas that unhinged during the confusion between Roman emperors. He laid siege to Jerusalem and waited. People weakened and starved, died in the streets, and many resorted to cannibalism.  10. Titus finally came in swiftly and burned Jerusalem to the bloody ground. Temple and everything. 3 years later the nearby fortress of Masada was finally taken. The Jews were made an example of for other cultures that contemplated rebellion. The point was not a victory of the Empire over a people, but a `victory over a god'. Jews were now the eternal enemy of Rome. By the year 135 CE, Jerusalem ceased to exist in all official Roman documents.  11. The Jews did not blame God for their downfall, but they blamed their selfish leaders, the Zealots, Sicarii, so-called prophets and messiahs. \\"They were the ones responsible for the Roman onslaught. They were the ones God had abandoned. In the years to come, the Jews would begin to distance themselves as much as possible from the revolutionary idealism that had led to the war with Rome. They would not altogether abandon their apocalyptic expectations...[but they] would be compelled by circumstance and by fear of Roman reprisal to develop an interpretation of Judaism that eschewed nationalism. They would come to view the Holy Land in more transcendental terms, fostering a messianic theology that rejected overt political ambitions, as acts of piety and the study of the law took the place of Temple sacrifices in the life of the observant Jew\\" (69).    Regarding the first centurydevelopment of Christian theology:    1. After the death of Jesus the zealot, James and Paul had been busy at work building up the story of Jesus resurrection and establishing Christianity. James stayed closely to a high valuation of Jewish custom with the new ideas, while Paul preferred to leave behind most Jewish custom. James and the Jewish leaders/apostles butted heads with Paul, and seemed to dominate church growth...until the destruction of Jerusalem.  2. Paul writes his first epistle, 48 CE.  3. Stories of Jesus circulated until about 50 CE, when some may have been written down in what is referred to as `Q' (German Quelle= \\"source\\"). There is no literal Q source, but it is a hypothetical document assembled in the minds of modern scholars who have gathered what they think are similar sounding passages in Matthew and Luke.  4. First Gospel (Mark) isn't actually written until 70-71 CE, after the deflating defeat of the Jewish revolt. Matthew and Luke written around 90-100 CE. Gospel of John isn't written until 100-120 CE and is heavily influenced by St. Paul. All gospels scrub their stories of any notion of Jesus as political messiah. They reinterpret Jesus as spiritual messiah to make it more palatable for surviving, Hellenized Jews, and for the Roman Empire.  5. The Council of Nicaea in 313 CE sanctions/declares orthodox Christian doctrines.  6. Council of bishops in Hippo Regius (modern-day Algeria) declare in 398 CE what documents comprise the Christian New Testament cannon.    The message Aslan hammers into the reader's skull: Jesus was a man. He was a Jewish freedom-fighter. The Jesus-as-God story came later as a survival tactic of many Jews trying to preserve and reinterpret their national identity for their new situation, and it thrived because it blended with Greek philosophical ideas. \\"It was only natural for the Gospel writers to distance themselves from the Jewish independence movement by erasing, as much as possible, any hint of radicalism or violence, revolution or zealotry, from the story of Jesus, and to adapt Jesus' words and actions to the new political situation in which they found themselves.\\"    Aslan may have been right after all, though little he knew, in his throw-out at the end of the introduction. What a person chooses to believe is a matter of faith. Aslan may not have quite succeeded in banishing all doubt from the believers mind regarding the Pauline Christ, yet it was a landslide victory in terms of MAKING the believer use his faith. The Christian apologists who assert that their ideas are completely reasonable and `believe-easy', thinking to make fools of their detractors and those who wrestle with intellectual difficulties regarding Biblical doctrines, have been served. Have they not read their own Bible? \\"The righteous shall live by their faith.\\"
B004W1GCQO|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this series. The characters are believable and engaging. I am excited about season 2 starting...it is a fun series!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I am as obsessed with GEORGE R R MARTIN'S as I was with Steven King back in the 70's and 80's. I am so absorbed with all his books I go back and read passages in his other books in the series.  Of all his characters. I like the DRAGONS best.  No, I really love them.  So I currently am downloading all of Martin's. Books.  DRAGONS was a FIVE all the way.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This is a really fun game. And I hope that others enjoy it too. there's a lot of challenges and upgrades. And the creators did a lot of good pictures and drawings. I thank the creators of the game of making a great game.<br /><br />Thank You Sincerely Maddisan.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend. I thought that it was not very imaginative and in fact<br />was rather a snooze! I do not plan to read anything else this author writes.
B00D8OHPF8|5.0|Joe, never disappoints when he brings out the new music and this CD says it all.<br />This is true R&B if you love some really good music and a beautiful voice.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Loved it, and couldn't wait to get to the third in the trilogy. Would read it again if I had the time.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This was a hard book to start because there were so many characters and it took quite a while you bring it all together. Once it did, it was hard to put down. Also this had the best epilogue ever!!!
B001NLKT60|5.0|I got book 2 mixed up with book 3 of the trilogy; so, I couldn't wait to finish this on to get to the last one. Wish he had wrote more like these before the author's  death. Loved the book, the quirky characters.
B00EQUP3Q6|3.0|It's been four years since Nine Inch Nails vanished from the limelight, and the band that returns bears considerable differences to the one we saw before. Frontman Trent Reznor has gone through an undeniable maturation process since the initial disbanding of the band, which includes the birth of two sons. Has becoming a family man mellowed out the former rage filled industrial/goth rocker? Hard to say, but one thing's clear: Hesitation Mark, is a significant departure from the band's previous offerings.<br /><br />Whereas 2005's With Teeth, and 2007's Year Zero, in particular, leaned heavily on familiar formula of contrasting downbeat verses with powerhouse choruses, Hesitation Marks is a much more all-around subdued affair, working its magic in much quieter and subtle ways. There are nods to the band's industrial influences here and there, and even some experimental tracks introducing elements never before heard in Nine Inch Nails's music. And of course, Trent still finds time for his trademark sense of angst and pessimism. He's just found new, more grown up ways to do it now.<br /><br />\\"Disappointed\\" is the keynote example of this. Whereas in his youth Trent might have opened up with a volley of screaming guitars and a torrent of anguish, here the damage is done by fuzz covered vocals, coupled with an anxious tremolo riff to create a suffocating sense of despair. Nor does he offer any sliver lining from the lyrics, as Trent spells out how nothing ever seems to go right: \\"Do you ever want to just get outta here/ So disappointed; just disappear.\\"<br /><br />The two advance singles win the award for best in show. \\"Came Back Haunted\\" is the most obvious homage to The Downward Spiral glory days, complete with a lurching mechanical keyboard riff that sounds as threatening as it does infectious. \\"Copy of A,\\" meanwhile, is a case study in how to slowly build over the course of a song, letting all the effects simmer in the background until reaching a big finish complete with overlapping vocals and plenty of buzzyworthy keyboard effects.<br /><br />Also of note are a couple of experimentations Reznor has whipped up. Those weary of the dreary old Nine Inch Nails should be most interested to hear \\"Everything,\\" a new wave tinged piece drawing inspiration from The Cure, with 80s-esque backing vocals and Adrian Belew's chugging guitar. This song is the biggest departure in the band's career, and easily one of the most upbeat songs in their catalog.<br /><br />\\"All Time Low,\\" on the other hand, takes its cues from Trent's buddy Josh Homme. Reznor made a guest appearance on Queens of the Stone Age's newest album ...Like Clockwork, in June. Perhaps not coincidentally, that album bore a song called \\"Smooth Sailing,\\" a significant departure for that band which sounded much more like a Nine Inch Nails song than the sludge rock they had been known for. Perhaps also not coincidentally, \\"All Time Low\\" is the closest that any Nine Inch Nails tune has come to sounding like a Queens of the Stone Age song. The funky guitar licks that back the verses and chorus sound like it could have fit in seamlessly on ...Like Clockwork. However, it does morph into its own piece as it advances, finishing with a spaced out, starry eyed twinkling coda.<br /><br />There's no question that Reznor deserves credit for changing up a formula that had been Nine Inch Nails's go to game plan throughout the 2000s. Yet in spite of all that, Hesitation Marks is an album that sorely misses that big punch and can't seem to recover from it. Everything is so restrained, mellow, and withdrawn that it all becomes monotonous well before the end of the album's one hour run time. There's a few songs here and there with somewhat big, punchy choruses (Various Methods of Escape, I Would For You) that also benefit from sleek, high tech production, but it still can't seem to shake the fact that Trent feels too afraid to let his hair down. It's reminiscent of what Bjork did with Vespertine --releasing a downtempo, after hours record as a followup to a pair of albums on which kicking her heels up was never an issue.<br /><br />Average pop rocker \\"Satellite\\" and wandering, dreary mope fest \\"Find My Way\\" presses that point and lets the album down as well as any song here. There is some variety to be found, and some musical ideas worth exploring, but Hesitation Marks can't seem to break past an inherent sense of self restraint that keeps these songs from developing into than they ultimately became. The return of Nine Inch Nails in any capacity is always a welcome development, but Hesitation Marks is merely an admirable effort rather than the home run many of us were hoping for.
B0015DROBO|5.0|The book is better than either movie, the English speaking one or the Swedish? one. I just wish the author wasn't deceased, so he could write more like this.
B005V2S7FW|5.0|Upgraded to Premium version so that I could use it on my mobile platforms too. This nifty tool is very reliable, always available and up to date. I highly recommend it to anyone needing to work on a computer and other platforms.
B00CZF8B68|5.0|Great upbeat, happy song!...At first i thought it was going to be another childrens kitchey type song but it wasnt ...its wonderfully snappy and i play it all the time!
B002QYSZBO|4.0|This was a movie I've heard about for a while, but just recently got around to viewing -- it did not disappoint. Robert Downey Jr. is at his best, and Val Kilmer portrayed one of the more memorable characters I can remember seeing. A few of the comments about Val's character being gay struck me as a little out-dated despite the movie being less than ten years old, but they're not terrible. The rest of the movie is very self-aware and entertaining, and a good play off the older detective noir of decades past.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This was a great game just wish it lasted longer!<br />Awesome graphics &amp; great story with a twisty plot.<br />I enjoyed the maze like feel of town also, the map help but the hint bottom get you thru!<br />the
B00EQ0CKRQ|1.0|This app is garbage , took my money instantly , but the app won't even try to download either on my kindle fire hd or on cloud. Thanks a lot Amazon, this experience does not encourage me to try another game. Must be nice for these jerks to collect the money and then give nothing in return. I'm thinking I'm going to look at an iPad.
B000SEIDR0|5.0|I could learn a lot of new and interesting things about food.<br />Very nice point of view.<br />Michael really can explain things in a very crystal clear way.<br />I recommend this book and others from him.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Beast the best game made I will play for hours and u can't summon herobrine or go to the nether or the ender so I hope to see that in the update<br />I will play any day went time minecraft is the best I would buy it if u want to learn geocentric shapes and how to build with nothing
B00CO4KGYA|5.0|Are we all reviewing the same app? I am addicted to this game! The purpose of the game is to aim the ball so that it knocks out all the characters in as few hits/balls as possible. Simple rules, yet fun and challenging game!<br /><br />The graphics are fine to me. A ball looks like a ball and a clown looks like a clown, etc. Wherever I aim the ball, that is where the ball goes. It is very exciting to figure out the right way to aim the ball to knock out everything at once. The story line is very funny too. I've had no problems running the game or playing the game. I never played Angry Birds so I cannot compare that game to this game like the other reviews. This was the free app of the day, but I would most definitely recommend this game to everyone. I don't know about kids but it's great fun for me as an adult!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Good game to play but will not go on facebook don't like facebook because I get flustered when I try .
B004EWFV9K|4.0|I would have given this book five stars, but Mankell gave me the impression that the series are about to end, with Wallander's memory waning.  It would be difficult for Wallander to continue being a good police officer with limited mental capacity.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|the best game ever, very active,it's better than the first one, more power-ups more levels & twice the fun! Love It!
B00B22ASUM|5.0|It was a really inspirational book. I loved it! I highly recommend that everyone should read it. I can't wait to read his next book.
1609984331|5.0|The recipient of my gift enjoyed the audio book thoroughly. I read the book years ago and loved it - very entertaining
B000TEREMY|5.0|Guru passed away to early but his music is still around.  This is the best mix of hip hop and jazz anywhere.  Pick it up.
B007PFD90G|3.0|There were parts of this tale that demanded my attention, but they were separated by segments that seemed quite mundane. Mundanity, however, is a part of life, and this is the story of a man's life. SO, I suppose it's to be expected.<br /><br />This wasn't my favorite Rushdie book, but it was good to learn about the man behind the novels I adore - I'm not sad I took the time to read this.
B00EDF43MY|3.0|Doesn't hold little one's attention very long as it is so repetitive. He's five and I guess needs more of a challenge.
B005BGBPBG|4.0|My wife and I watched it together and enjoyed it. It is a good chick flick and the language is clean.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I loved the book<br />I hope I get the next one soon<br />And I hope you will love the series too
B008RA3X5E|5.0|My son uses this app to get himself and his brother up  for school. They use music they like to get up and get ready. They set the sleep timer to play a song long enough to get dressed and cleaned up.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very nice game with great graphics. I'm guite impressed with what the creator has come up with. Only thing is low feedback from horse.
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|Awesome. Just the kind of good 'bad' movie for a guys night in the man cave. Casting is great, and screenplay mostly good. It gets a little much with slow motion effects, but its a plot element, so I guess that's okay...
B000035Z1Z|5.0|If you are looking for a feel good, hilarious, &#34;did they really just say that? omg, that's awesome&#34; type of movie, you are reading the review for one that has all of that in spades. Kevin Kline, who embraces his character's devilish personality, truly balances out the type A personality of Meg Ryan's character. It's a movie about how you expect to love someone, how you envision one scenario for your life... and how all of that can change when you step out of your boundaries and allow life to happen. (This is not very specific summary of this movie. However, I showed this to a boyfriend, and then to his parents, and then to the rest of his family. They absolutely adored the film, each and every one of them.)
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|its a fun game but it constantly has glitches. :( I also cant get past el Machos lair for some reason. I beat him once but now it doesn't show.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Love it. Keeps you on edge and never lets you down. Anyone who likes to be scared, thrilled and tested needs to check it out.

B00992CF6W|5.0|I un istalled it a few months ago and now i dont know how to reinstall minecraft pocket edition, please help me thank you.
B00957T6X6|5.0|As a train conductor, there are many opportunities to crack open a book while sitting and waiting.  I happened upon a hard copy of the fifth book and ended up downloading the five book series.  HOOKED!!  Have since downloaded the 1st and 2nd tv seasons and subscribed to HBO to watch the third.  My husband is now HOOKED, and now I can't wait for the sixth book to come out.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|The Art of Racing in the Rain is a wonderful, unique perspective in the \\"I love my dog\\" genre.  It's a sweet, easy read and I would recommend it for anyone who has a pup as a true companion!

B003G4W49C|5.0|Great story, interesting and multidimensional characters. Made me want to pick up the sequel immediately. I definitely recommend you get it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Addictive fun with challenging trails and obstacles.  Definitely worth downloading and playing.  Good time waster but keep an eye on the clock because you may find yourself not getting anything done because you're playing this too much.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|The book got me thinking of true to life trails and the workings of our legal system.  A good vacation read.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Third is a great memory game for numbers, colors and location of items. Challenging and fun. Very addictive. Awesome game.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I do love the story that Mrs. James presents. Anastasia and Christian work well together.  I love the action and the romance. The only complaint I have is that sometimes, the story dragged but the rest of the story more than made up for it. This story is not just about sex.  Thank goodness.  There is a wonderful story line about a tortured man who is frightened when he falls in love.  He is forced to face his past and fix his emotional problems. It is a lovely story.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|ilove this game i will never leave it i play it almost 24/7 i love the girl minion she is fun to play LOVE THISNFRICKIN GAME
B005IQZB14|1.0|I thought I would like this book since I enjoy stories with a 'spirit of adventure,' but after reading several chapters I could not get past the continual use of the \\"f\\" word! I'd like to think people had a larger descriptive vocabulary than that!! Add to that her atheistic<br /> views, adultery, abortion, & use of drugs....and I had had enough. I wasn't going to waste any more time reading trash. It was an easy decision to delete from my kindle.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loved this book. It was very interesting. Christin and Anna were a good pair. Couldn't wait to read book two.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book was full of action. Was glad to see they got married. It made me laugh and made me cry. It was realy good.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was just as good as the first book. It was good to see Anna and Christin move on to the next leval of their relationship. Was glad to see Cristin want more.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|I love this movie and it's great to watch as a family.  The kids may get a little bored during some of the parts but it's a great movie.
B000LN7HUC|5.0|It's small. It's lightweight. There's room inside for utensils and even a little food. Runs on any kind of alcohol.
B001FD5KJM|5.0|This is a super great film that makes you remember why we all love Robert Downey Jr.  This film is so much fun.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This just made things harder.  I need the next episode now but have to wait until 2014.  It's not fair!
B0040Z9H5K|5.0|Another great outing by Robert.  He is so fun to watch. Great characters and a lot of action.  Highly recommend!
B000VDUWMC|5.0|Chose this book from many on Bill Gates web site [...] Great place to find a huge diversity of topics in books. Recommend both the book and the web site.

B00EEXPDTM|3.0|Loved all the actors. Could of been a better story. The book was crazy. Amanda is a great actress of our time
B00E5C3AJM|5.0|this is a great app. I'm a fan of the former version ( Star girl ) So naturally i'd like this one just as much._
B009AMANBA|5.0|Well done!  Close to actual history - which is pretty impressive for hollywood!  Good purchase and you will watch it again and again.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I loved it! Can't wait for the new season to start!! Looking forward to seeing what new characters will be added.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Loved it!  Watched season 1 and 2 in a week.  Have recommended it to many in my family.  Waiting on season 3.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|The point of view of the story is told from a seven year old so I understand why the book is fast paced and poorly detailed, but I feel like the story was extremely hard to picture in my head.  I couldn't help but feeling that if a different author had portrayed the same ideas it could have been much better.  Frustrating read.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|It was a little slow getting started, but once it picked up, the story lined moved quickly.  Ultimately, it was a fun ride.
B002R27J1W|4.0|Great movie adaptation of a stage play . . Very suspenseful.  If you are a fan of Audrey,  you will love it.
B004ODLUGM|4.0|My kids love this story. We even bought the book. The kids watched the video over and over again. May consider buying other set as well.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I just finished reading this book last night and immediately had to download the next. This is my first historical fiction novel that I have ever read. It really brings the war to life in a way history books just didn't in school. The book allows you to see the war thru the eyes of different characters in all different settings. Both before and during the war, you see how war transforms and alters lives. Perfect blend of history and fiction.
B00005B4GT|5.0|An amazing album... it is an essential album for any Radiohead fan. And it sounds so much deeper on vinyl.
B00A285OOW|5.0|I love all of the Phillippa Gregory Books so far. I am interested in the 15th century and the Kings and Queens, so her books appeal to me,
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I saw this series in the Kindle store but passed it over more than once. I like science fiction to a point, but I am not an avid reader of the genre. But finally I decided to give this series a try. I am really glad I did. The premise of the story was original, and the characters were very well developed. I cared about them, and was eager to find out what they would do next. Personally I like long books because I get more time enjoying the story. With books 1-5 all together, I definitely got to sink my teeth into a great read. It went pretty quickly as I kept turning the page just to see what came next. Again, original story line that was revealed at just the right pace. I am going to buy another book by this author right now!
B000OLRH10|5.0|With fantastic performances by Leonardo DiCaprio and Djimon Hounsou as well as a riveting adventure and heartbreaking setting, Blood Diamond brings very real issues to the table and presents them masterfully. I absolutely love this movie and highly recommend it.
B000BJ7BCK|5.0|I love disney movies and this is no different. Great family movie teaching values of friendship and trust. Plot and cast are high disney quality.
B002ZG99TA|5.0|Loved this movie since I first saw it. Plenty of good action. Got the movie so I can watch it when ever I want.
B00DU74U74|2.0|Like others I recommend reading the book first because the movie had cut out some important detail that explained why the rebels trusted Wanda, why Ian fell in love with her, and why she wanted to give Melanie back her body.  The cast, animation, and world was beautiful but the movie's story fell short.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|It makes me think a lot this app is awesome and It is a very addicting game I really like this app
0312944926|5.0|I STRONGLY RECOMMEND OTHERS TO READ IT. IT WAS VERY EXCITING ANG A &#34;PAGE TURNED&#34; FILLED WITH EXCITEMENT!!! DAN DROWN WRITES (FOR THE MOST PART) VERYEXCITING BOOKS!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|awesome show and it is only getting better. Highly recommend watching this show. Can not wait till season four come out.
B003U0I9U0|5.0|This is an excellent collection of songs, and the booklet has beautiful photos. Only disappointment was that no lyrics were included.
B00005RDRO|5.0|From the stellar cast to the hilarious lines, this movie had me hooked like a fish to a delicious looking bait. I was a bit skeptical of it when I first purchased it (the sole reason of purchasing it was because I'm a collector of the incomparable Dame Maggie Smith's works) but I found myself watching it over and over again. The Charlestons were my favourite characters along with Mr Sidney Wang. And of course, the blind butler!<br /><br />I didn't regret getting this. The item arrived in perfect shape. A must-have for Dame Maggie's fans!
B0040UAYI4|3.0|Soon as you figure it out it works really good wish there was more games to use it on though
B00D6B4PUG|2.0|Takes too long to load. IMO, doesn't improve standard email app. Works only in wide screen format. Not worth paying for.
B00EPC2ZOI|5.0|This show has the goods through and through.  Beautiful and haunting cinematography, excellent acting, intelligent writing and plot.  Every episode has kept me watching with rapt attention, and every ending makes me groan aloud at the thought of having to wait a whole week to find out what happens next.  Very suspenseful!
B008RA606S|5.0|I've been a fan of these &#34;boys&#34; ever since they came to San Diego for a brief appearance at a music festival concert. It was great to watch them grow as artists, watching each chapter unfold. All of their DVD's have shown a depth into their lives that faraway fans like me appreciate.  Their lady concert was no different.
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|I'm surprised how much I like this series. Great plot and characters. I appreciate watching it on Amazon so I can turn on the script text. Keeps me from missing any clues in the dialogue.<br /><br />Really worth your time if you are considering a series.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|It's very useful as an alarm clock. I like how it can be dimmed when I sleep at night. Alarm settings can be saved and reused. This is a must have for Kindle fire hd owners.
B00C27LB20|5.0|I just recently heard one Jake Bugg song, &#34;Lightning Bolt,&#34; on TV from an English concert and liked it. This album is absolutely wonderful. Can't recommend it enough.
B004EF6632|5.0|I loved it! Richard Armitage plays a great, emotionally controlled, but in love, hero. Fans of the 1995 Pride and Prejudice and the 1999 Persuasion will fall in love with this mini series.
B00EC7GRS6|1.0|This dock has a permanently attached cable and it is short I mean really short....not worth the purchase...DO Not BUY! apart from that NO AC Adapter. I did read the other review on this item but was unsure about the length of the cable now i know :(
6305428387|5.0|One of my all time favs!  One of John Candy's last movies made. And problem the best one in my opinion!
1439153663|5.0|I read this book in 3 days. I could not wait to see what happened at The Kitchen House. The writing is wonderful and you get so attached to the characters in the book. One of the best books I have read in a long time!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Love this game. It is so much better than the first one. It is exciting and so much fun to play.
B008469DGY|5.0|Gameplay is great, game is a lot of fun! Would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a fun game to play on their smartphone.
B00CL0J99K|4.0|I have to say that this was one of my favorite movies to view this year.  I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it.  Robert Downy Jr, Don Cheadle and Gwyneth Paltrow were all great.  I thought that the movie really played to the strengths of the characters and told a great story.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT:  I thought that the way they used Ben Kingsley as the fake Mandarin was brilliant and definately out of left field.  I thought it was so humorous in the way it was presented and definately surprised me.  They could have stayed with the comic origins and had the rings of power and maybe even Fin Fang Foom, but this was great all the same.  I know this really irritated some of the die hard fans out there, but you cannot follow the comics line for line.  Why watch a movie based on the exact material you just read?  Do you not want to be surprised and fear for the characters?  If you know every aspect of the story, then what is the enjoyment of it.<br /><br />Definately understand why this made so much money.  Best movie of the year.  Definate buy.
B00DZ8GLDO|4.0|Story line has holes and the daughter has too much makeup considering what she's been through, but entertaining enough for an action flick.
B008JFUPK8|3.0|My family just went to see this this past weekend and while it was a decent movie, I could not get into it.  Special effects were good, but I felt that the story was not nearly a well written as the original film.  I had always enjoyed the Superman movies with Christopher Reeves (exception of Superman 4: The quest for Peace), but this was not for me.  Even my two boys asked about half way through the film if it was going to be over soon.  I asked why and both of them said that they were bored with it.  I definately think that the movie has a more serious tone and good acting, but I wasn't thoroughly entertained as when I watched the earlier incarnations.  My wife and daughters felt the same.  One viewing was enough for our family and it will definately not become part of our home collection.
B00006LLJ4|5.0|I gave this item as a gift, and the recipient was delighted to receive the item. It was in great condition, and the whole buying experience was a good one!
0143124544|5.0|I went into this story thinking to be entertained instead I came away thoughtful and sadden by the events that cause some people to be in the position that they are only enduring life not living it. Well Done.  This is going to my book club. What an incredible discussion that will be.
B001FB55YE|4.0|Another great Guy Ritchie flick with some twists, spins and deception.  Top notch actors throughout with G. Butler, T. WIlkerson, T. Hardy, J. Pivens, & M. Strong to name a few.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Not as good as the first and second. It is slow and dragging. Not very much excitement. Hard to follow.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I myself don't play it or even understand it but my boy loves it and that works for me.! Thanks
B00DUL3VFM|4.0|Always have enjoyed this movie. Just on of those fun to sit and watch on a rainy afternoon movies. Looking for a deep movie this is not it. Good action and interesting story line.
B007ZXK08C|2.0|Although I do love Giliian Flynns way of describing the characters and making me feel that I've really got to know them - I just think her stories takes turns that are not credible and that I don't agree with. the story would benefit from having been half as long, I found it long winding.
B005QYKD4I|4.0|As a PRIME member i should be able to view this movie in HD when i stream thee HD version, right? Wrong! There was one bar on the quality! It got so annoying -- i couldn't continue watching the movie.  I love Transformers (80's child, what can u do) so this was just wrong.<br /><br />FIXXIT PLEASE!
B00BWWS81S|5.0|If, like me, your previously favorite KT Tunstall album was Acoustic Extravaganza, then, like me, you'll have a new favorite in this album. I've always wished for a KT Tunstall album that wasn't overproduced, one which showcases her songwriting talents without studio gimmicks, and this is it.<br /><br />After her last album, Tiger Suit, I was ready to give up on her. That album seemed to me to be a sell-out, something that her record company forced on her, making her into another cookie-cutter pop dance diva. This album is a welcome return to her roots, of intelligent songs sung wistfully and soulfully. It's far better than I expected, has already been played often, although not often enough, and will continue to be enjoyed by me for a long time to come.<br /><br />KT Tunstall may well be this generation's Joni Mitchell, a folk-based songstress who explores modern facets of female angst, emoting universal feelings. Her singing has never been better, and this album is a major step to establishing her as one of the best songwriters of this day and age.
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|Love the insights into the immigrant experience - which i have also experienced. I look forward to reading it again.
B005544V6A|5.0|Witty writing and a fun story (albeit out of the realm of reality) but I love law shows and this hits the mark.  Very entertaining and gets better as it goes.  In the middle of season 2 now and its been great so far.  Do not hesitate to watch!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this is the best game ever! my little brother can play this! i taught my little cousin and my grandma how to play!
B0064T6LV8|3.0|This game is an average Pinball game. nothing extremely special, but also nothing bad. You can't go wrong for free.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|I really enjoyed this book even though I kept thinking I shouldn't.  I made me laugh and cry (which is very hard to do, trust me).  Well written, good charactor development..... all in all a really great book.
B008469DGY|4.0|This game is a fantastic way to kill time with minimal effort. Being able to control the spin of the ball in mid air is fun. The courses are pretty. Mostly this game wants me to get out and play a role uhh nd of golf. I would install it again.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This was a wonderful story.  I had a hard time putting it down.  I highly recommend this book to everyone.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|The first chapter rocked with a fantastic tale of mystery and fantasy. But, then the story totally changed. It became somewhat convoluted. And, ultimately I lost interest. Khaled Hosseini is perhaps one of my favorite authors. He put out two back-to-back award winning novels that I absolutely loved. But, it seems the momentum has waned. This one didn't seem to have the same intensity and raw grit as Hosseini's previous works. Unfortunately, I simply could not get into this story and couldn't finish it. I am hopeful that Hosseini will put out better novels, fashioned similarly as his previous works, that will be much better than this one.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Spider is great fun. I use to have it on my old computer. But my new one didn't have it. Now I can take it any where  I want. Thanks
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Absolutely love this game. Very addictive though lol. Love the games although can't seem to complete a set in any room. Have fun.
B005DNO7MQ|4.0|The first part of the movie is merely okay, but once Maximus enters the arena, the real fun begins. Fantastic, imaginative fight scenes which even got my adrenaline going, and I'm a nerd who wears bows on her shoes.  Crow was a stoic pillar of strength as a deposed general turned gladiator around whom Rome's disaffected republican  elements rally. Great recreations of Rome and the Colosseum, in addition to lovely costuming and a decent supporting cast, some of whom chomp at the scenery.  Highly enjoyable, nevertheless.
B00406O7YK|5.0|This is one of my all time  favorite movies. Barbara Streisand has a voice that is impossible to praise enough and the music was so very well suited for her and the movie. Walter Mauthau (SP) was an excellent choice for Horace, we truly lost a legend  he passed away.<br /><br />I have seen this movie a number of times and always enjoy it more each time. I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys good music, song and dance.<br /><br />  Joanne Harries
B00130EVSS|4.0|Loved the cool as a Siberian winter Luzhin, whose emotionless exterior  belies his true nature in this story of Russian mob activity in London. Mortensen is wonderful here, inhabiting his character so completely, that this viewer wanted back story in seeking to explain his motivation. Naomi Watts is lovely as the kindhearted midwife, who nurtures the baby of a young Russian immigrant forced into prostitution, and Vincent Cassell, the thuggish scion of a particularly nasty family, has an amazing scene while talking to a little girl where his true nature and regrets is revealed. The only thing that drove me crazy was the heavy German accent of Armin Muller Stahl, otherwise a good actor and fine in this role playing a reptilian mob boss. Very well done and, of course,  the now famous nude fight scene is terrific.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Right along the same lines of season 1&2.  Excellent series and would highly recommend.  Bought off of amazon prime-very fast and easy.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love this! I have a Nook and just recently bought myself an Android tablet - I now have both on my tablet and am reading more than I have in the past few years and loving it!
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I love this game so far!  I have played it for a week now and love everything about it. I hope I continue to like it &lt;3
B001ANSS5K|1.0|Uh, John Green did you for real write a sequel to this? Say it ain't so. At least in the ending the main character didn't ruin his life and be an idiot. I enjoyed this book at times, but the ending fell flat. Overall disappointing. But hey reading, food, music...everybody has their own palette. It just wasn't for meh. Meh meh meh. Meh. Mmmmmmmeh.
B00EEDJM2Q|4.0|love this game.  I have no issues. best game I ever downloaded! I am so addicted. I cant wait till the next one comes out.
B008Y1YK9Y|4.0|This should be the last of the Men in Black series. Definitely not as good as Nos. 1 or 2.
0765334798|5.0|Loved the premise and John Scalzi as always delivers the story with his own twist of humor.  Made me laugh out loud several times and I couldn't put it down
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. If Sherlock Holmes had really lived, I have no doubt that he'd be as Robert Downey, JR.  Potrayed him.
B004SH40BQ|5.0|I was a little skeptical to buy this product because I have never heard of Kokkia, but immediately after removing the transmitter from the packaging I inserted it into my ipod classic and within seconds it was paired with the bluetooth headset that I've had for 6 years. My intention is to use it with wireless beats, but until I get them this will suffice because it works seamlessly.
B007LGPSX0|5.0|We always watch it when we where younger; We are still in love with some of the caracters and it's a good piece of drama
B008469DGY|5.0|Addictive app. Good graphics. Similar to nfl kicker 13 in terms of control interface. Golf is relaxing. I like this app.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|Dinos are are great looking on this game.  You can use coins to get the advantage.  Once you have money producing dinos and buildings you will have fun.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I love the Hunger Games series but this book was my least favorite. There's a lack of action. Its okay but if your a person who needs alot of action DO NOT BUY THIS!!!
B00005JNS0|5.0|It is my boy's all time favorite.  We got the Cars II and came back to get the Cars I.  Love every minute of it.
B009YN2M7S|3.0|This book is different from the movie! It is good but should be considered as a separate entity just saying
B005NS0VNU|3.0|Understand that these songs all have been re-recorded.  Although they're okay, they are NOT the original versions...  Which was a TREMENDOUS disappointment to me. You may be better off purchasing original CDs.
B00CEB5QU2|4.0|I've only had this item a few days but have been impressed so far. I was most impressed when I tested a 1 TB Western Digital external hard drive and realized the MLW was able to power the hard drive. The battery light turned red so I figured the use time would be cut significantly if I tried to use the WD hard drive for a longer period of time than just a few minutes.<br /><br />I gave 4 stars because of the lack of instructions and the constant back and forth required when setting up the MLW on a new WiFi. Also, if you are using the MLW while it is charging, it turns off when it has reached a full charge causing you to have to set it all back up. Luckily, the back and forth between the app settings and your device settings isn't as bad as when you are setting it up on a new WiFi.<br /><br />Overall this is a great device to have if you are someone always finding yourself maxing out the memory on your device. The 3 major memory hogs - pictures, movies and music - no longer have to be stored on your device. And it makes the decision to leave your computer at home when you travel that much easier. A final plus is that it allows you the opportunity to use multiple data storage devices (i.e. SD card, USB drive) that can grow with you at a more reasonable cost vs being locked into one storage device (a single WiDrive) and having to purchase another when you need more memory.
B0054SMID0|5.0|This was a really great movie! Followed the book well. The actors did a great job and kept me on the edge of my seat.
B0055D3EFU|5.0|This was an excellent movie!  If you want to be scared out of your seat then I recommend this movie 100%.
B0090SI4OC|4.0|I am a fan of the book who had low expectations for the movie. I was pleasantly surprised by the movie.
B000FBJHT4|4.0|The author gave many &#34;facts&#34; that he claims was accurate, would be interested to know just how much was really accurate .
B00B5HQL50|5.0|I thought it was the best movie of 2012.  The opening action scene was the best 10 minutes I saw in ANY movie last year.  Lots of tension, a very well acted.  The movie dwells a great deal on the pathos of James Bond, and how he feels about being the way he is.  I found it fascinating but if you are looking for a dumb popcorn movie than you will be bored.<br /><br />Cons- The third act is so much different than the first two acts.  I loved that but I can see how it will turn some viewers off.
B000YAYIXQ|5.0|The download has many many songs on it. And was such a good price. She was such a talented artist. Such a waste. R.I.P. dear Amy.
B000SEGUDE|4.0|I read this book after seeing the movie... Generally the way I do things giving limited time available for reading fiction. There were things that I liked better in the book -- such as much more of Somni's story, education and enlightenment -- however I was truly blown away by the movie and feel that it did represent the book well. I had hoped that the book would help clarify the distinction between unique characters as they inhabit various bodies through time, but I still struggled to follow who was who. The comet birthmark helped me to keep track of one, however I struggled to understand how injustices committed by one against another were reversed in subsequent lifetimes. In spite of this, I consider both the book and movie among my favorites.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I installed this App because I was looking for more information.  This App gives more info than the other weather Apps I have tried.  Its all I need.  Great App!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I loved this book. I did not want to put it down  this books keeps your interest with the story of the characters
B006S08RLU|4.0|Like going to the theatre , no more else to say. No violence or anytnhing stressing for the viewer, just a nice and magical story.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|...but works great overall, a lot smoother UI now that its out of beta. Keep up the good work guys.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is very addicting, and its one of my favorite movies. My son also loves this game. Great game when there's nothing else to do.
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|Funny and sad , sometimes overwrought with emotion. Learned the difference between being black in USA and being black in Africa.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I really like all types of Mahjong and this is no exception.  I would recommend this and a lot of other games that I have on my Kindle.  They are great for travelling
B009KS4XRO|2.0|It is hard to figure out how to use the darn thing!!!!!  I haven't been able to so I am frustrated.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I love Christopher Eccleston.  The best NEW Dr. Who.  Watching on my Roku and Amazon Instant Prime worked out well although not so much on my iPad due to buffering issues (DSL, sigh).  FANTASTIC!
B003Y5USF0|5.0|I love the movie and I could watch it all day long and never get tired of it. To me, that is the best movie that Helen Hunt has ever been in. More movies like that should be made.
B0041CGP02|2.0|There's a few good/great songs on the albums, but not enough.  I should have read the album cover better before I purchased it.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I got this game knowing it was cool but I didn't know it was this good!<br />You should get it definitely
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so cool. I like to play it all the time. It's so addicting. The app is free and its even better
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I used my alarm clock on my Kindle this am and I loved it. Great sounds to wake up by!
B001NLKZUA|4.0|This book was very well written. I only gave it four stars though because I thought it dragged on a lot through it. The book held a lot of interesting twists though that Madeline want to finish it quick so I can get to the next one. So I hope you enjoy it!
140006922X|3.0|I found this book a disappointment.  I was really interested in factual information about the real Jesus and even his family.  I thought the author jumped to conclusions a little too easily.  (example: The fact that Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist and shortly thereafter went out into the desert made Mr. Aslan conclude that Jesus became a disciple of John the Baptist yet he never offered any proof for this.  For the rest of the book this unproven fact was presented as factual information.)  I had been told that the Koran actually has a good deal of information about Jesus and also his mother Mary.  Though Mr. Aslan is, he states, now a Muslim, unfortunately none of that information from the Koran is included.  I learned little I hadn't already heard one time or another except for how violent Rome's repression of Israel actually was.  Joan Schonbeck
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love horses but can't have any of my own so this is a great game to have. It seems like you actually have horses and all
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Cool movie to watch, and gives you a good laugh when down, awesome music to listen to and great cast.
0545265355|5.0|The Hunger Games Trilogy boxed set was purchased as a gift for my Daughter. She was over the moon to own these books, as a keep sake.  She is reading them again.
B006TLFPKO|5.0|It's really good and entertain to watch. Keeps you into the movie, has an awesome cast who keep every movie wroth it too watch.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|honestly who's Idea was this new version of the update? sorry, but it sucks. its way harder to navigate now and really glitchy. when Im on the strongest Wifi signal available it still takes an incredibly long time to load. on the previous version it would load in a second. if you can, go back to the version before this one and make the map and radar feature a bit more understandable.
B005ES0Y0Y|5.0|my wife enjoyed these crocs. she uses them for work and she says they are very comfortable when standing on your feet
B004EPZ03Y|2.0|Before the release of this movie the last time the Muppets had a theatrical release was way back in 1998 with [[ASIN:B0052LE7A6 Muppets From Space]]. Since then they have mostly stagnated with straight-to-DVD and TV movies. Someone at Disney reckoned a reboot was in order so now we have the unimaginatively-titled \\"The Muppets\\". I was surprised to see Jason Segal's name as a writer in the opening credits, and I had hopes that it would feel original and inspired rather than something made by a Disney committee.<br /><br />With the gang disbanded and pursuing their own paths their theatre is at risk of falling into the hands of a greedy oil magnate. A young misfit Muppet decides to get them together and save their legacy. Sound familiar? It's virtually the exact same plot from [[ASIN:B004G8SW9I It's a Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie]], by way of many repeated scenes from [[ASIN:B00CUDD0KW the original Muppet Movie]]. I have to say I wasn't smitten, despite really wanting to like it. The human interaction with the mop-puppets didn't seem natural (you know what I mean) and felt stilted and difficult. They're just in the background with no decent story.<br /><br />There were too many songs, a couple being completely superfluous. Despite the numerous cameos I just didn't feel that this movie had any star power. I longed for Michael Caine to show up and add some credibility to it. Sadly it was just too TV-ish, with many TV actors filling out the various parts. This ranks somewhere towards the bottom of the Muppets long list of movies, even beneath The Muppets Go Medieval starring Troy McClure.<br /><br />The Blu-ray looks very good in 1.78:1 1080p with Jason Segel's many warts and moles offending my delicate eyes. The sound is in punchy DTS HD-MA 7.1 and there are a fair amount of extras.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Game of thrones book dance of dragons is fifth and it shows while the story line is great the text is long winded and it shows that. The author is getting tire of telling the store. I waited till this book came out before beginning with the first book. And the title and release date had been released but the date came and went two times two years and now we have yet a new release date that will he will miss too. I feel cheated do not start reading. I want my money back
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Doesn't perform as expected. No support. Good idea but Google let the ball drop. Don't waste your money. Better to try something else.
B004J4WN0I|2.0|Loved the creativity of this plot, connecting centuries past with the life of people on earth today.  Some of the language seemed a little childish and the characters not very real.  However, maybe that was the goal.  I enjoyed reading it but probably won't read another one.
B009AY04A8|5.0|A fun and interesting items to find. Of course the game gets harder as you progress however it remains fun.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Wonderful story writing. So much going on and can't wait to find out who will win.  Exciting tale! These books are long and fully detailed. Feels like you are a part of the story. It's a big game and you pick your winners.
B0084670FU|5.0|Unlike many folks I so enjoyed the story of different families and the events that shape the overall plot, You can easily see why Brad Pitt gained fame for his acting, now becoming a headliner. He drew me in as the character does everything possible to save his wife while engaging others along the way. Of course Cate Blanchett helps in this journey while supporting Brad buy his performance was stellar.With multiple stories taking place in Morocco, Japan, Mexico and the U.S.A. the film travels in several interesting but unexpected forms. All ending in a tragic story for some of the family involved to the story,<br />.<br />Try it
B0034G4P7G|5.0|I do not watch it all the time but this was a very well written, thought out and produced movie.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|We got this set knowing nothing about Minecraft other than our nephew loves the \\"game\\". His dad said he also really enjoys Legos now, so we took a chance. Boy! Was that a great idea! He opened the gift and played with \\"Stevie\\" all weekend long.<br />I will let you know that my older nephew and brother helped keep all the small pieces in baggies, etc so nothing would get lost - there seems to be quite a lot to this set.<br />We also teamed this set with a Minecraft Tshirt and the kid was simply overjoyed with both. Highly recommend as long as your kid is really into Minecraft.
B003L77GRO|5.0|I LOVE Dexter! The fifth season was a great addition to my collection. Series is just as addicting as Nip/Tuck.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I love this game. It's so addictive. It is very easy to play. It keeps me occupied without doing much thinking.
B002ZG98Z0|5.0|Great addition to my collection! You can never go wrong with this amazing cast and story lines. I am Carrie
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|I'm not a comic book fan and know next to nothing about the stories of these characters. I do like films though. I usually don't enjoy films like this, but I saw some good reviews so I thought I'd give it a shot.<br /><br />There is a lot to say about this film, it feels longer than it is, not because it's slow but because there are so many characters and micro-stories.<br /><br />I'll try to keep the review focused by pointing out a few things that make or break a movie for me:<br /><br />Win:<br /><br />There is a good attention to detail here. Effort was put into showing us the strengths and weaknesses of the heroes and you get a good sense of just how strong they are but well executed damage of various vehicles and machines we know something about in the real world. You will see the Hulk tear parts of aircraft apart for example and you will see just how powerful Thors hammer is.<br /><br />Thor is awesome. A demi-god who can control lightning. I like the actor who plays him too. I liked all the characters really except for the bow-man who I felt should have been taller and bigger. Iron man is very likable too. I've seen the original Iron man films. I don't know if I care to watch a whole movie about just one of these characters, but the strength here of course is that they are all here together. Actually I thought this could well turn out to be a mess. I expected cheesy one lines and jabs at each other but the hostility felt a bit more real than that. Not all that deep running, but real in the sense that it was a bit mindless and you know it will soon ware off, there is no real reason for these people to dislike each other.<br /><br />The main stand out to me for the first half of the movie is the Scarlett Johansson as Natasha though. She is the only character I felt showed real vulnerability. Her moves and combat style are somewhat unique too which is a nice change. She held the film together for me, until the second half where there is so much action there really isn't much character play involved. She is very pretty, very likable and they don't pull off the female-jerk character always trying to prove her worth cliche. She is also genuinely smart, not in one cheesy one liners, but in her actions.<br /><br />The dialogue was pretty good I felt, entertaining, witty and I actually cracked a smile a good few times this movie. I felt some of the one liners and short little gag scenes were actually funny, and that is rare for me with these big action type films.<br /><br />The action is fun and the CGI is good.<br /><br />Fail:<br /><br />I try to judge it fairly, it's a comic book movie so a lot of what takes place is going to be a bit silly I guess. I felt though that the main villain was not very intimidating. He looked quite stupid in his costume and didn't really command any fear or dread. He didn't dominate the screen like a good villain should, but there are aspects of the story that sort of allows for this. I shan't say anymore about that.<br /><br />One more cool thing, there is a nice back-story here between him and Thor, which was very neat and I could strongly relate to it. But It was really briefly played out and not very developed.<br /><br />Now to the lame things. The 2 main female characters are nice and not so pretty that you can't believe their roles. However they did clad them in these ultra tight \\"booty-shot\\" pants. That's lame in my book. I can understand the eye-candy that the comic books indulge in, but we really need to put this kind of thing in the past and start treating women with dignity rather than have them waive their asses around the screen. Shame on whoever made those decisions.<br /><br />Not really enough character development to really draw you in big time and as I hinted at earlier you don't really get a sense of anyone's vulnerability apart from Scarlett Johansson.<br /><br />Watch it if you like this kind of stuff, if not you might enjoy it just for a change of pace and a bit of pop-corn fun. My only regret is I watched it by myself. It's definitely a movie you enjoy with a buddy or spouse or what have you.<br /><br />Edit- I forgot to mention 2 things. 1 this movie made me want to see Thor, and I did and I enjoyed that a lot too, and I think Thor was a better and more enjoyable movie than this one though both suffer from a lack of great finale.<br /><br />2 this movie has very bad sound in my opinion, most of the time I had to strain to hear the dialogue. It's like it just wasn't important or something. It's not bad like a cheap movie might be bad, but it's muffled and quiet. They needed to add a little something to make the speech more intelligible.

B00BRUQ7ZY|2.0|The author is very well read and knows his history of the period of Jesus' life.  However, his conclusions of who Jesus was is very different from a Christian point of view.  He draws a characterization of Jesus as a revolutionary who wanted nothing more than to foment rebellion against Rome, the Chief Priests, Pilate, etc.  A very controversial theory!

0062080237|4.0|This republished version of Neil Gaiman's novel from 2001 is like a director's cut of a movie. Originally differently edited, Gaiman here releases the book he originally wrote, more or less.<br /><br />It is one of those shambling, rambling, picaresque Don Quixote type tall tales - except the landscape is remarkably dark, gothic, terrifying and bloody, as well as quirky, inventive and playful.<br /><br />A mysterious man, Shadow, whose rather mythic identity will eventually be revealed is released from his prison sentence early. And from then on, things go abysmally wrong. The symbolically named Shadow, who indeed, always seems to be in someone's, stumbles into a complex ancient battleground of mankind's yearning dreams, of the stories we told ourselves of gods and heroes, past and present, of what we worshipped and adored.<br /><br />Gaiman peoples America with the various gods brought from various parts of the globe, by those who landed on her shores, from history and from prehistory. Bellicose Norse Gods rub shoulders with matriarchal pagans from Africa, Egyptian animal headed gods accompany leprechauns and pixies. Savage humour and horrific zombies party together. Orpheus makes a different kind of journey into a different kind of Hades, and Eurydice is far from a pretty sight.<br /><br />Ancient gods like these have been forgotten, but linger on, and modern America worships new myths, creates new creatures of power - mass media, technology - paler but no less violent gods, and as demanding of human sacrifice.<br /><br />I'm not absolutely certain (not having read the original) whether the 'writer's cut' improves the no doubt rather less rambling version of 10 years ago. There were times, sure, when i felt - oh just get ON with the narrative and stop going round and round, and then another revelation would strike.<br /><br />Flabby it may be at times, not, I think, anywhere near as sure and crafted as Gaiman's latest,The Ocean at the End of the Lane but still, here is a writer who is populist, hugely inventive and with such brilliant imagination and generosity in the telling of tales, that occasional overindulgence must be acceptedre is a writer who is populist, hugely inventive and with such brilliant imagination and generosity in the telling of tales, that occasional overindulgence must be accepted

B001NEXEEG|5.0|This was the second to last western John Ford directed John Wayne in - &#34;How the West Was Won&#34; was the last. It was also the first film that Wayne and Jimmy Stewart appeared in together, at a time when each was at the peak of their career. According to Lee Marvin, Ford shot the film in black & white in order to enhance the shadows needed in certain key scenes. Ford also used Paramount Sound stages, his other recent films shot on location and in color. Despite this, the film is fine entertainment and the acting is very good with an especially fine performance by Jimmy Stewart.

B00BLCHYKU|5.0|You may have seen that nature show that tries to show you what it's like to 'Be the creature'. Well, this show might be called 'Be the Viking'. While it's got the battle scenes and rivalries you'd expect, it also tries to show what it was like to actually be a viking: what were their aspirations, beliefs, worries. How did they relate to the Christians who were their prey? What was their worldview? This is historical fiction in film format, perhaps not unlike the historical fiction that's been popular in book format for some time.<br /><br />Some say that it's not &#34;accurate&#34;,<br />* that the main character Ragnar Lothbrok wasn't a single guy (but an amalgamation of real people),<br />* that the geography is mixed up (he couldn't have hiked from Norway (west of Sweden) to Gamla Uppsala (on Sweden's east coast) in the time allotted in the show<br />* that it's untrue that the Vikings didn't know what lay to the west at the time of Ragnar Lothbrok.<br /><br />I'm no expert, so these may be strictly true. But what the makers have managed to do is shine a light into the mind of Vikings, and show them to be multi-dimensional real people, not just the marauding gold-hungry killers we learned about in school (that's what we learned in Ireland, at least!) And that's quite an achievement. Can't wait for season two!
B005S9ELY4|3.0|This is a quality show very much like the Untouchables of today. Has a very good cast and seems well acted, paced, and directed but honestly, I could have gone my whole life without seeing it and it wouldn't make a difference. The plot is nothing short of a cliche fest of gangster and action movies.<br /><br />1.  A secret team setup to take down an impossible enemy<br />2.  Protagonist's wife is pregnant and uses the \\"I need you to be a father, not a hero\\" on him<br />3.  One of the good guys is banging the bad guy's woman and \\"If he finds out we're dead\\" ensues<br />4.  Both guys from #1 and #2 do the \\"I'm sending you out of town\\" thing to their respective women<br />5.  The whole \\"secret team\\" are misfits<br />6.  Oh yeah, the good guy banging the bad guy's woman was warned by a friend not to but...he did anyway of course \\"Gotta die of something\\"<br />7.  The bad guy is super angry and does pretty much nothing but lose his temper the whole movie<br />8.  The \\"secret team\\" has a cowboy that can shoot anything and everything but only with his six gun<br />9.  The \\"secret team\\" is immediately tracked down by the cowboy's partner, who wasn't invited, and uses the line \\"Good enough to get the drop on you guys\\" and instantly is on the team.<br />10. A single team member dies igniting the teams collective passion<br />11. Protagonist is saved at the last second by dying member #2 before defeating the bad guy in fisticuffs<br />12. Of course there is the 5 minute part of how the team is recruited and they all got a tiny moment to be cool<br />13. Secret team's first mission is a disaster<br />14. Are rewarded by the chief after successful mission and...\\"I could tell you good job, but I was never here\\"<br />15. Goodest guy quits the force after bad guy is caught<br />16. Second goodest guy gets the hot girl that used to be the bad guy's<br /><br />I bought this Blu-ray DVD Ultraviolet copy on sale at Worst Buy for $10 as an alternative to going to the theater one Saturday.

I'm now on to the second season, and in the same way that it's interesting to see each new, &#34; Bond.  James Bond &#34; interpret the role, so it is with the new &#34; doctor &#34;.  He's a character you can LIKE, a hero (and we don't have many of those these days) who while saving the planet still manages to maintain charm, wit, humor and honesty!!
1451695195|5.0|This book is proof that God exists.  I did not need the proof, but I wanted to read his story and he uses a lot of<br />his teachings to prove that all the parts of his brain that were not working while he was on his death bed, could not have<br />created the experience he had with God.  He was sent back to his body and cured.  Before this happened he did not<br />believe in God, now he knows for a fact there is a God, our Creator.  Another proof he had is when he was in flight he<br />had a woman with him guiding him who he did not know at the time was his biological sister who he had not seen as he<br />was adopted, after he was cured, he found his biological family and was sent a picture of the deceased sister, age 36, and was astounded to see that she had been the woman guiding him up over the veil.  God wanted him to know that HE is real and sent him back totally cured from a deadly meningitis.  He wrote a book to show the world that God is real and that we all have to<br />obey the commandments and live good lives in order to obtain peace in the world and our place in heaven.  The book is<br />a testament to all people that God Almighty is there watching us each day.  Get back to church, repent and pray to the Lord!

B00002DE4E|5.0|This is one of the most chilling albums ever made, with droning guitars, icy bass lines and stentorian vocals. And that's not even considering the lyrics, about singer Ian Curtis' epilepsy and failing marriage. When Curtis hanged himself at 23 on May 18th, 1980, Closer officially became the stuff of rock legend.
B000FCKGPC|3.0|The series, as a whole, is a very strong one. However, I was least invested in this installment.  While we get the latest in &#34;how can we make the Stark family suffer&#34; - at times to good effect - as we have in previous books, the bulk of the book was around characters that I was least interested in - and it introduced new characters that failed to spark my interest.  The most interesting part of the book is the redemptive path that Jaime appears to be on - but even his sister's downfall was not as satisfying as it might have been.  In short, even on a bad day, Martin is an excellent writer - so this was not bad when compared to the bulk of the books out there. However, viewed in light of the other books in this series, it suffers by comparison.

1451626096|1.0|For someone with a degree in history, this author writes the most historically inaccurate books I have ever had the displeasure to read.  To be able to honestly critique her work, I have had to suffer through her abominations of the lives of the principles in The War of the Roses, the Tudors and the Stewarts.  Why, when the actual history is so full of drama and complexities, does she feel the need to re-write history?<br /><br />Yes, I know these are fictional novels but they are presented as being historically accurate.  Nothing could be further from the truth regarding this novel and indeed, all of Gregory's novels.  It is distressing to see those other reviewers stating in their review &#34;I didn't know that&#34; - you still don't know it because it isn't true!<br /><br />These are just a few of the major historical distortions in this book:<br />Henry VII raped Elizabeth before they married:  There is no indication anywhere that this is even remotely true.  In fact, all contemporary souces state that although the marriage was made for politically expedient reasons, Henry and Elizabeth grew to care for each other a great deal and had a happy marriage.<br />Perkin Warbeck: The majority of historians agree that he was NOT Richard, Duke of York and was a pretender.<br />Katherine Huntly:  While she was known to be extremely beautiful, there is no indication that Henry VII fell in love with her.  In fact, until her husband was executed she, too, was held prisoner.  She went on to marry two more times.<br />Elizabeth and Richard III: There is no evidence whatsoever that Elizabeth and Richard were lovers or that they planned to marry.<br /><br />As for the book itself, it seemed as though 90% of the book was either about Henry VII not trusting her or her keeping the secret that Perkin was indeed her brother.  *yawn*<br /><br />Some of Gregory's novels are at least entertaining to read despite the historical inaccuracies.  Not so with this one.  This book is one big, lying snooze fest.ze fest.
B007THA4FI|1.0|Having never read any of the Harry Potter books, I was looking forward to reading this book.  Our book club, the Novelettes, selected this for our August read.  When we met to discuss the book, no one had anything good to say, and some of the members stopped reading after a few 100 pages.  I continued to read it, because I kept expecting it to get better.  Having been an elected official on a council, I was amused by some of the antics when trying to fill a vacancy.  But it was not worth the time it took to read 503 pages.

This is a book I will re-read as I know I want to dwell in the scarry places I thought I had left behind.

159514188X|5.0|The first time I read this book, I did it in one day. No shocker there. It's pretty impossible to put down. Contemporary YAs generally aren't my thing, but this one was amazing. Hannah was so real, I could hear her voice as Clay listened to the tapes. I could imagine everything she was going through. It's angst leaked out of every page. I think everyone who's gone through high school can feel for her and relate to at least one of her thirteen reasons why. Most people could relate to more than one.<br /><br />The longer I read it, the more I hoped that somehow Hannah was still alive. That she'd walk in and her death would've been faked.  It would've all be a way to get back at them ... and Clay and her could live happily ever after. That's how good Asher is, he made me want to believe in the impossible. He made me more than willing to let him tease and taunt the reality of things.<br /><br />I felt for Clay, too. I'm also a sucker from any YA that is told from a male's POV. His pain, his world, his voice were all really enticing. The way Asher weaved Hannah and Clay's story together-at the same time-was brilliant. They each made the other's side more intense. It filled the book with suspense. One moment you had to know what Hannah was about to say, then Asher would let you know, but just as he made you want to know right now what was happening to Clay. It was so mean.<br /><br />Hannah fails to help someone who was assaulted and in her tape she tried to make amends ... and yet didn't. Everyone fell short in that regard. It really makes you stop to think what would I have done if I were Hannah? And hope that after everyone's heard the tapes, someone does something to help. Everyone failed Hannah, let's hope that everyone doesn't fail the other girl too.<br /><br />All it takes is someone speaking up and other supporting them.<br /><br />Poor, poor Hannah.

B00285K1KE|1.0|The Hulk isn't the most engaging of stories to begin with -- he's a guy who gets mad, turns green and breaks stuff. His internal conflict is really an external one so this is a difficult character to give depth. I don't know what happened to Ang Lee but he must have suffered a brain injury or something to make this (if I didn't know better I'd think that this was Joel Schumacher back to put unnecessary neon onto another comic universe) . I understand he was trying to recreate the comic book flow for this movie but it is cheesy and distracting. For some reason they thought that The Hulk should hop across landscapes instead of running and it is in a word: dumb. He looks more like a bouncy-ball than a monster. The acting is mediocre and the villain is made of cardboard.

B00BJA2VFW|5.0|I really enjoyed playing this game. The story line was entertaining and the game itself was more challenging at times. On the strength of the Big Fish name (and being from the Seattle area) I ordered more games from BF. Unfortunately, either they won't load or continually freeze my Kindle completely, which takes a full day to restore power. C'mon Big Fish . . .  I know you can do it right.

B0091REZMW|4.0|So far it's good. Just started playing tonight. Looks like its time consuming and has many levels and stages. I like it. Hope it stays that way. Not sure why it asked me to write a review so fast only been playing for a few minutes.
B0058VW36U|5.0|if I can't have candy crush, this will do. Fun and different with cute but simple graphics. also a non-violent game for younger kids to play
B00594XOZU|4.0|This app will let me talk to my friends any wear but it wont let me upgrade it and i have this on my kindle fire. The app is still great but i want to know how to upgrade it i have tried everything and i need help!! :)
B009KS4XRO|5.0|It's awesome and insanely addictive. Too much fun. Download it now if you dare. Easily consumes time out of your day.
B0017KIBAI|5.0|I got this controller because my dorm at OSU my suitemates and I have a 360, ( for Halo), a PS2, (for nostalgia sake), and a Wii where we basically  only play Super Smash Bros Brawl and Mario Kart Double Dash. I needed an official controller to match my friends who had logged hours in theirs. I also like getting high-quality controllers for mu Xbox, so why not get one for one of my childhood consoles?<br />This controller is straight from Japan, even keeping the original box it was sold in at the time. The controllers' color scheme is plain & simple; but almost elegant in a way. The cord is 3 meters long, which is longer than the older GCN controllers,  which is really nice. It plays just as the old ones did; the buttons and the analog sticks work well.<br />Overall, I would recommend this controller because it's from Nintendo and they're running out of stock of official controllers for a very reasonable price.
B001ECDVKE|5.0|This was a Christmas gift for my mom as she's always loved the movie. It's a good comedy! Easy to watch over and over.
B00DJLLO0M|3.0|Except for a few songs that the other reviewers also pointed out - Jupiter, X-ray, Pills - the album simply doesn't register even after multiple listens. Full of undeveloped ideas and half-baked lyrics, this is a disappointing album from fans that have come to expect a certain quality of output from Aviv Geffen and the incredibly talented musicians he had collaborated with to make this album.
0061438294|5.0|My purchase received was exactly as it was described in the advertisement on Amazon. Product was not expensive and in good condition.
B009E3EY38|2.0|The Zeppelin reunion was one of the most anticipated and most important events in the history of rock. So of course this is a must have for any fan. It is also performed well. I say \\"well,\\" but not great or excellent or mind-blowing or any higher superlative. Plant is singing an octave or two lower for the entire show, and the band isn't as tight as they were back in the day. If the song-writing wasn't so good, it would be a little (ahem) sleepy. Of course, I'm happy for the reunion, and I'll keep this in my collection. But I doubt I'll listen to it much. How the West was Won is miles above this as a live performance.
0060936223|5.0|Never been a huge Patti Smith  music fan, but always intrigued by her personality. This was a helluva love story...Two artists in love with each other and living the art life. Also, had no idea how Patti was prowling NYC during such great times. Encounters with Hendrix, The Factory contingent, Sam Shepard...the list goes on. Getting to know Mapplethorpe through her made me appreciate him even more.
B00BB8OHMW|5.0|There is humor, mystery, suspence and, of course, a beautiful love story!  It certainly made Shakespeare and his writing come alive and as someone who writes poetry, I understood the amazing power of the muse!  Each actor seemed perfect for the roles they played.  This was the 4th time I watched it and still love it!
B0088W6IMQ|4.0|This show is fun to watch because of the comic undertones with the drama....The story line is believable and enjoyable tell the end
B001F12J48|5.0|This is a beautiful light fixture. The crystal really shines. It was a little difficult to install, but it can be done by a novice. There were a few broken and missing pieces, but they were quickly replaced upon request.
0316201545|5.0|I loved the first book and Colfer's wonderful story-lines for the old beloved characters we all grew up on.  He knocked it out of the park once again with this wonderful sequel.  His writing is fantastic and how he keeps track of every storyline and is able to do them all justice is absolutely amazing, a skill every great author needs.  I can not wait for the third book in the series, I'll be anxious till then wanting to find out what happens to my two favorite twins!
B00846REIS|5.0|Reading it for the second time around! I love it!!! Much better than 50 shades, and I liked those. Sylvia Day is a much better writer. I felt so close to Eva, and cannot wait for the fourth book. It's killing me. Read all three books in a week.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|This isn't the greatest game but for the cost it is not bad. I would recommend to a person who likes this style
B003MOHX8S|5.0|&#34;Epic&#34; is a word that is sadly grossly overused along the lines of profanity to where its meaning and impact wither away to a banality equal to a soggy french fry.  TSFH music IS epic, stirring classical music that just evokes a ton of emotion and Invincible has alot of great cadence and build to it.  I find that it doesn't do so well as background music when i want to be in a focused or concentrated state of mind for intellectual projects (weaponry around my room starts purring at me).  However for playing video games or even just listening to its fantastic and several hours can go by as you hit the replay for just one more run through.  I love TSFH music for  working out especially if I'm a little low on motivation, having had several sluggish mornings with this pumping through the sound system snap me out of my sluggish state and get going.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Liane Moriarty has gotten my attention by the eye catching title, then sucks me in, trying to find out what is going on with this book!  Great Job!  Hopefully I can learn from your Secrets & Skill! Take Care! -M.W.W.
B0002BO05S|4.0|The movie is pretty good, but the actor that plays the role for Jesus is just okay.  you have to consider it is an old movie, but the story it well told.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|I downloaded this app to my Kindle Fire HD 7 a while ago.  It's a big game so you'll want to make sure you have space for it.  So far, I have mostly played campaign mode and have completed a dozen or so games.  It has worked flawlessly for me.  I noticed a lot of complaints from other Kindle Fire users.  Not sure what the issue is.  Maybe it just doesn't run well on the first gen Kindle Fire.<br /><br />In any case, I am a happy customer.  I also am a casual player of the MTG card game.  The app is a great way to play while on the go.  The graphics and sound are beautiful.
B002PZC8BM|5.0|Love this show,,, every season is better than the last , Always waiting for the next season to come out!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The Brits have ruined TV for me. I can't seem to watch anything without a British accent and enjoy it any longer.<br /><br />This season is fab just like the rest. Nothing more to be said.
B00DLKXF3A|4.0|WOW -  that's all I can say, wow!  Avenged Sevenfold's new endeavor is another triumph to savor and celebrate!  Somehow, these guys keep finding a way to give us new takes on the metal/hard rock genre that both entices and delights.... and the biggest wonder is that is doesn't sound old or like a repeat - the music all sounds new and unique.... great music to enjoy!<br /><br />For those of you who didn't buy the deluxe version of the CD, you definitely need to go out of your way to find a copy of the \\"Saint James\\" bonus track on that deluxe CD version - It's the crowning jewel of this album, and easily my favorite with a 5-star hook that satisfies to the very end - Enjoy folks!  *****
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great app to use on the kindle fire. Does what it says it does. I have had no problems with it.
B00E5Q1LTY|3.0|There is nothing wrong with a remake, but this movie was all over the place. The actors did their job well, but the plot had too many implausable twists. One minute the villian is knocked out by a single blast, then he takes 9 shots to the chest and still keeps coming. The plot holes kept pulling me out of the story to wonder why the writer's couldn't have put together a more cohesive effort.
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|Buy this album. It is sultry and sexy and dark and addictive. Buy it. Do it. Don't make me tell you again.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I first heard about this game many years ago when they released a free trial with the first level of the game.  It was such an addictive game, the moment I was able to afford the full game, I got it.  I've played this game on PC many, many times and recommend it to all my friends.  I'm really glad now I can play it on my phone, on the go!
0811879542|5.0|I purchased 5 of these for gifts after<br />seeing my 3 & 6 yr old grandchildren<br />repeatedly check it out of the library !<br />It is big fun to read for together! Skip the electronic version and enjoy your kids reactions together!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I have tried Swype, Google Keyboard and the Samsung stock keyboard and none of them can compare to SwiftKey.  Not only I can customize how it looks, I can add extra buttons for text navigation AND it allows me to have several languages installed at the same time.  No more having to switch between languages when I talk to my friends and family abroad!
B000FBJAEG|5.0|It's a great read! He builds suspense with his characters and storylines, draws you in to being addicted to the story.
B008469DGY|5.0|I'm relatively new to my Kindle Fire HD and am not a golf lover.  But this game is great for the average Joe and is quite addicting.  The graphics are wonderful and its much more fun than the many other apps I've downloaded.  Try it!!!
B004HWYTP4|5.0|rented and watched right before going to see 2nd one in theater. great idea! will watch again and again  for sure
B00ECU2RGY|3.0|Story was only ok, but effects were cool. The ending could have been better. Definately worth renting but not buying.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Dowton Abbey is a wonderful series. I watched it again because I like it so much and am looking forward to the next season. Love the characters, storyline and the actors.
B002QBS9KE|5.0|The Platronics Voyager is the PERFECT EARPIECE.  So when I lost the eartip I was devestated because I couldn't afford to buy an ENTIRE EAR PIECE.  I searched long and hard for these and I was only able to find them online.  The fact that they were so inexpensive was just another blessing.  Now I'm back in business!
B006ZB3V2C|2.0|I am not happy about this downloaded app. It has never worked in spite of the many things done in attempt to have success. I wasted a lot of time working on this.
6305428352|5.0|I have loved the movie since I saw it in middle school.  Knew I had to buy it since I really wanted to re-watch it.  Perhaps it's because I am a band geek at heart, but I find it to be so heart warming!
B000LXHK2C|5.0|Absolutely charming with beautiful scenery and a plausible story line.  What's not to like about spending some time in the French countryside in a charming, if not slightly delapitated, house and vineyard.
B0030V0PEW|5.0|If you need a method to install defenses in you organization to reduce error, this book will definitely show you the way.
B00DHSK3RM|5.0|This game is a lot of fun.  I normally don't like to have the sound on for games, but it really helps to have it on to understand what is going on.
B00915G6R6|3.0|I like The Good Wife. I've watched 3 1/2 seasons so far. It is good entertainment with a nice mix of legal wrangling and personal relationships. The only thing I'd wish for is a lot more stability in the firm and more focus on the legal.<br /><br />Seasons 2 and 4 both have a heavy emphasis on the shortcomings of the firm. There is way too much back stabbing, financial troubles, and the like. I want my TV shows to have strong characters and in this case strong firms. Whether it reflects reality or not I don't care. I just would prefer that the firm is rich, powerful, and wise.
0345803485|1.0|I can't finish this book. I was expecting so much more and am shocked to find such a boring, poorly written book. I guess this is a teenage thing. Boring, silly, unbelievable. The girl is weak, immature and helpless. The guy is a young girl's fantasy, but hard to take seriously since he is so over the top. The sex is silly and boring. I'm moving on. Not worth the time.<br /><br />Someone needs to start a Fifty Shades: We are Not Stupid Refund campaign!
B00AYB1RGG|5.0|Awesome!  Can't wait for DREDD 2!!  This is not your daddy's Judge Dredd.  Action from start to finish.  Special effects are amazing.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|I fell in love with Alice and wanted to climb into the book and help her. Lisa Genova is an amazing author.
B00DHHWYAW|1.0|My wife really wanted to see this movie on our HDTV in 3D.  We were not disappointed in the 3D disk however the Blu ray disk was not playing smoothly and took forever to load.  Wish I would have bought it through a local store to return for a better copy.
B008IJT0CE|4.0|Keeps asking me to rate it even though I said &quot;Don't ask again&quot;.  Other than that, great app. Love the timer.
B003K1EYM6|4.0|These are great.  Worth the money to buy the genuine thing.  They work every time and are built much better.  Tried two cheap knock-offs and would always recommend the original.<br /><br />This would easily be a 5 star product except for the fact that it is made by apple and isn't included with their iPad.  The idea they would make such a good tablet then limit its capability without the purchase of a third party kit is unfortunate.<br /><br />It would also be irritating if you upgraded to a new iPad and had to replace your connectors.  But that's apple for you.<br /><br />Seriously though, if you have an iPad 1-3 and take a lot of pictures this is extremely useful.  Great for vacations!
B008HK3XOU|5.0|Have gotten it for my grandson for christmas. This is what he wanted.  Did not open, just wrapped and put away for christmas.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game keeps your mind guessing.  Makes you think and keeps your mind sharp! Great game for any age or gender.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|The writing was fair but not great. I didn't like how the female body was referred to as &#34;my sex.&#34; Terrible ending.
B00C9G22R2|1.0|I went to the premier of this movie with my kung fu classmates and Sifu. The movie starts with Sifu Ip surrounded by a group of thugs in the middle of the night during a rainstorm. The fight begins, we are given no reason as to why this is happening its just ready GO. Right away I notice the scenes are very cinematic with lots of abrupt cuts and angles followed by, what I feel, an overuse of slow motion scenes. At one point a fighter and Sifu Ip takes turns kicking a carriage at each other kicking it so hard until they crunch it like a soda can. There's also a lot of punching you so hard i send you flying 50 feet and take out the 5 guys trying to catch you. The fight ends with Ip-Man as the victor. Its at this point that I start to worry about the film. Wing Chun is known for its great speed not crushing power so already the movie is inaccurate to the style.<br /><br />What follows are very disjointed scenes with very little exposition other than narration. If I had not seen both Ip-Man 1 and 2 I would have no idea what had happened given the small amount of exposition given. We jump from his family home, to a forced move to hong kong, to him opening his school, etc. Years pass in between these scenes leaving you with a lack of sense of whats going on. For some inexplicable reason the last third of the movie focuses on a different character all together and Ip doesnt even show up. The ending felt very abrubt and it felt like the director said \\"oh crap I didnt show Ip-man for the last thrid of the movie\\" so he procedes to smash clips from all of his very short fight scenes in the last minutes.<br /><br />The movie suffers from very poor execution in my view. Scenes feel very disjointed with little exposition as to where we are or why something is happening. As one reviewer has mention this is more Asian film art than it is an action martial arts movie. The film also for some reason focuses more heavily in the Baguazhang style than the Wing Chun style that Master Ip is known for.<br /><br />If you're looking for an action movie along the lines of the Donnie Yen's films you will be sorely disappointed. If on the other hand you are looking for a more historical cinematic experience then this may be more to your liking.
B005PK57NU|5.0|It caught my attention from the very first episode. And I was addicted. Couldn't stop watching. One episode would end and I had to watch the next right asay
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is fabulous game to play. Basically it's Temple Run bbut instead of tilting the device you do everything with your fingers. The only bad part about the game is that the whole theme of it; spray painting a train and run away from the guard. But over all it's very fun. You should get this app.<br /><br />  ~Karen Reynolds
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I started watching at the suggestion of my sister who lives in the UK.  I am hooked, can't wait for the next season.
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|Watch it; you won't be sorry.  Great story, acting and photography combine to make a movie you'll tell friends about and return to watch again.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Such a great show! Always keeps me wanting more..... Had one glitch with session 3 show 5. It stopped for 10 secs went black and then started again.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|This is a very inexpensive standing case.  It works fine for both videos and reading.  Very good priced  I even like the color..
B00278U1W0|5.0|This Blu-Ray is a must-have for classic rock lovers.  The really interesting thing about this concert is that Clapton and Winwood selected each other's songs to play.  There are some incredible classics and some great unexpected stuff as well.
B001QWBM62|5.0|Loved it. A powerful tool for recording anything. I use it to record lectures. A superior product by far! I used another recorder at the same time. When I compared the recordings the ZN4H was by far superior.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Couldnt let  it go , the story stick to you that you want to finish it recommend it..<br />Finish in one daay
B00BQ1D7BQ|5.0|Stephen Stills, Kenny Wayne Shepherd & Barry Goldberg have created a great band. I am a longtime Stills fan and knew next to nothing about the other 2 musicians. They are great on this recording as well. The chemistry between them is obvious and I love all the songs. The guitar interplay between the 2 is fabulous and Barry Goldberg ties it all together, along with Chris Layton on drums and Kevin McCormick on bass.<br /><br />The 4 new songs, written by all 3 and sung by Stephen are great. My favorite is Don't Want Lies. Word Game, originally acoustic on Stephen's second solo album is actually better in this version and still timely.<br /><br />The other 5 songs are covers. Kenny Wayne Shepherd sings 4 of them: That's A Pretty Good Love, Search And Destroy, Honey Bee and Talk To Me Baby. My favorite of these is Talk To Me Baby but he does a great job with all of them. I don't understand why he has not sung more with his primary band- he is good.<br /><br />The final song, Rockin In The Free World, a Neil Young cover, is fabulous and I love the way Stephen sings it. He always does a beautiful job with any song of Neil's that he has covered and this is no exception.<br /><br />Stephen's voice is perfect for the blues and he seems so revitalized and happy to be playing with these guys. I hope they keep going and and produce another soon.<br /><br />Finally, if you are a Stephen Stills fan, buy this because you will love it!
B008035H16|4.0|Good book tells you about zappo's story in a comic. Easy reading (7 hours).do recommend it . You cannot open in on web browser, you require an ipad or iphone .

B00ABKGG0C|4.0|I read Blood Song in the Kindle edition. I'd purchased it a couple months before actually reading it, having decided to purchase it on the basis of Amazon reviews alone and because so few books in the fantasy genre receive as overwhelmingly positive a set of reviews as this book had received. Then, after purchasing the book, I let it sit on my Kindle for a couple months before I made the time to read it.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed about the book when I began to read it was its incredibly long prologue written entirely in italics. On my Kindle, the prologue came to 14 pages. Prologues are always a dicey subject: usually unnecessary and almost always quickly forgotten as one reads, but seemingly pro forma for most authors of fantasy novels, especially those attempting epic sword-and-sorcery tales. (Similar to the pro forma inclusion of a map. This novel also includes a map. The map has few features--frustratingly few--and is probably unnecessary.) I've read many fantasy novels over the years, so I'm generally forgiving of the useless prologues in many of them. They are a habit for me as a reader; I've read and forgotten so many of them. However, the fact that this prologue was written entirely in italics, for so many pages, was an irritation. One expects italics to be used sparingly; as emphasis, they are used to emphasize something peculiar, making it stand out--and a prologue by its nature already stands out. Also, the fact that by the end of the prologue one learns that it's actually a framing device rather than a prologue, and that it pretty much reveals at the very outset the protagonist's final state after the next 600-or-so pages that will follow....Well, I was very suspicious of the remainder of the book after I realized that so much was being revealed so soon.<br /><br />The author seems to have been slightly confused about what kind of book he wanted.<br /><br />Normal epic fantasy should leave some doubt about its conclusion, which the framing device almost obliterates. Especially coming-of-age stories in which some abandoned youth gradually works his way up from nothingness to epic greatness: part of the tension is the question of \\"Will he make it?\\" and \\"What will he become?\\" which the framing device answers within the first 14 pages. The majority of the book, occurring in the past, is one huge flashback to the little bits written in italics and scattered throughout the book. I feel no fear of spoiling things for those who have not yet read the book when I say that, after the first 14 pages, you know this protagonist will live to his late twenties. Yes, the rest of the book occurs in the past, proceeding from the time he is ten years old; but the author will have spoiled the \\"great reveal\\" of his survival to his late twenties after the first 14 italicized pages. You will also know almost everything about what that 10-year-old will become. Not everything, however.<br /><br />On the other hand, the author seems to have taken some pages out of normal movie or television practices by weaving back and forth between the present (the \\"framed,\\" extremely lengthy sections all in italics at the beginning of the novel and each \\"part\\" of the novel) and that flashback past while also purposely and quite obviously withholding information in either account. Indeed, he leaps about when writing the past events, purposely leaving out some of that narrative in order to have gotcha moments later in which the missing episodes are revealed. In a 2-hour movie or a 1-hour television episode, this is forgivable because so much has to occur within a short time frame; but in a novel of 600+ pages, when one quite naturally reads the narrative as....well, a narrative development, one would be forgiven for feeling that the author has tipped his manipulative hand far too many times. He's not subtle about it. (I did have the impression while reading the novel, on several occasions, of being in the midst of a marathon of episodes of some television show.)<br /><br />He seems trapped between the desire to create a semi-mythical character via episodic flashbacks and to create an epic tale. I think he settled on the former, and I think that is unfortunate. He could have had his mythical, great character without sacrificing narrative cohesion with so many jarring chronological moves and none-too-subtle pulling of the rugs from under our feet.<br /><br />All-in-all however, the above criticisms do not detract much from the entertainment value of the novel. The imaginary lands he describes are intriguing, the cultures intriguing, the histories intriguing. The main protagonist is mostly interesting, although one quickly grows tired of the fact that he incessantly bemoans his own killer nature. The first 3/4 of the novel or thereabout reminded me of a blend of Ender's Game and the classic movie The 36th Chamber of Shaolin--with perhaps a little of the movie 300 thrown in, particularly when the protagonist undergoes one particular Test in his training. For those who enjoy the martial arts (by which I mean, the art of war and combat, not necessarily only the Eastern variety), this will be an engaging read. I tore through the book once I began reading it.<br /><br />The worst aspect of the book, by far, is the fact that the author seems to have never learned of the semicolon. I have never in my life read so many run-on sentences. Some are not so bad, but sometimes the grammar is so convoluted by run-on sentences combined with clauses that you have to exit the narrative and try to parse out what he is trying to say. These run-on sentences are not merely oversights or accidents but form a huge portion of the writing throughout the book. It is as if he used his word processor's find-and-replace function to find all the semicolons and replace them with commas. The rest of the writing is actually very arresting--at least, engaging, non-repetitive, descriptive--and I confess to being mystified that the lesson of thesemicolon and sentence construction never made a dent on his psyche or inner critic.

B005LAIGF0|4.0|[[ASIN:B00B6KKY1S The Allure of Nymphets]] has that nymphets do not want to be treated like children and they do not want ephebophiles to act like children. For example, in the film Margaret (2011), high school student Lisa (Anna Paquin) went to visit Mr. Aaron (Matt Damon), her high school teacher, at his Manhattan sublet to get advice, because she, \\"... didn't have anyone else to talk to.\\"<br /><br />However, Mr. Aaron became distraught after Lisa performed fellatio on him, but Lisa was unsympathetic. She said, \\"Don't worry. I'm not going to tell anybody. If that's what you're worried about. I totally initiated the whole thing. Anyway it's just sex. You're acting like a little kid. I'll see you in [high] school.\\" The portrayal of Lisa as a sexually aggressive high school student is an accurate one; thus, Mr. Aaron should have been just as aggressive in rejecting her advances.
B008TMA1LY|4.0|this is an ok game.  my kids liked it and they played it a lot.  then got bored with it.
0140177396|5.0|I read this book once in middle school in a Language Arts class (where we picked apart the language and grammar) and once in high school in an English class (where we talked about the symbolism and hidden meaning behind every single thing in the book). There are still notes in the margins of my copy from those classes and it was fun to read the notes as I was reading the book this time around. Overanalyzing usually makes me hate a book, but I remember still loving this book after we finished and even after we were forced to write multiple papers on subjects like \\"the significance of Curley's wife.\\"<br /><br />We also watched multiple movie versions of the book in those classes. The book translates well into a movie and it kind of reads like one too. Just as a bit of a side note, after watching the movie with John Malkovich as Lennie, I can no longer see Lennie as anyone other than John Malkovich while I'm imagining the characters in my head. It was interesting reading through the book this time while imagining John Malkovich as Lennie and knowing exactly what was going to happen.<br /><br />I feel awful for Curley's wife and I really like how Steinbeck allows her to tell her story right before she is killed. I know the men on the ranch call her a \\"tart,\\" which means that they think she is promiscuous, but I honestly believe that she's just lonely. She might be looking for a physical relationship with some of the men (like Slim), but I think she's the kind of person who thrives off of attention and compliments, which is why she hangs around wherever the workers are and why she is described as being heavily done-up with makeup. I know a lot of people are disputing this in their reviews, but I think that Curley abuses his wife in some way (either physically or mentally). Her death is tragic and it's one of the main things that I vividly remember from the book and have remembered ever since the first reading. In a way, Curley's wife is innocent, just like the animals that Lennie has accidentally killed over the years. Curley's wife's death is also one of the times that we see Lennie \\"lash\\" out and actually become angry. Right before Curley's wife is killed, we also see that Lennie becomes angry with the puppy. The puppy went to bite him, then he smacked it and he accidentally killed it. The way he tells the story to Curley's wife makes it seem like he might not be as innocent as George makes him out to be. While I don't think Lennie knows what he's doing and he doesn't really understand consequences, I do think that he had a bit of a mean streak, which is one of the things that George was seeing before he shot Lennie.<br /><br />I agree with what George did to Lennie and I'm so glad that it was George who shot him and not somebody else. There are a lot of comments on here saying that what George did was inhumane and just plain wrong. It's 100% wrong today, but back then? George knew that Lennie was dangerous and he didn't want him to rot in some cell, let alone be mentally and physically abused by people who hated him and didn't understand that the whole incident was an accident. No one else except for George, Slim and Candy really understood Lennie (George understood him the best, obviously). George didn't want to kill Lennie, but he had to, given the circumstances. The foreshadowing in this book is almost too overwhelming (but it's still absolutely perfect), what with Candy's dog getting put down and Candy saying that he wished he had been the one to put his old dog out of her misery.<br /><br />One thing that has stuck with me regarding this book is that damned vaseline hand of Curley's. I'm not the only person to have dwelled on this subject because I remember my classes discussing it and I see that there are discussions down below relating to the subject. Back in middle school, my teacher said that the gloved hand was sexual and Curley was keeping his hand soft for his wife (nice thing to tell middle schoolers, huh?). That thought stuck with me and now I can't look at vaseline without thinking about this book and Curley's gloved hand. Upon re-reading the book again just recently, that gloved hand has me thinking that the vaseline was just a rumor that one of the workers (or Curley himself) started. Obviously, Curley and his wife are unhappy in their marriage. Curley goes into town to the local whorehouse once a week and his wife appears to be lonely and completely unhappy in her relationship (as evidenced by the fact that she tells Lennie all about how she could have had a better life if she hadn't had married Curley). I think the gloved hand just creates distance between Curley and his wife in the story and it really doesn't serve any other purpose.<br /><br />The build-up to the end of this book is just incredible. My heart doesn't race often when I read a book, but after Lennie kills Curley's wife, you know exactly what is going to happen. If you want to learn how to write an absolutely amazing story, read this book and use it as your writing bible. Steinbeck's prose is also excellent. I love his use of dialect. This is the only book I have ever read where the dialect actually works and, within the first few pages, all of the characters are speaking in a Southern, uneducated way in your head.<br /><br />I'd like to add that the cover for the version of the book that I read (the Penguin classics cover) is just absolutely awful. Whoever designed that cover way back in the '90s should be fired (if they haven't already been fired). The cover of the book isn't appealing and it made me hesitant to re-read the book. The \\"clipart\\" style of the cover is just plain awful! I could think of so many other wonderful things to go on the cover of this book...<br /><br />I don't give five star ratings to books lightly. I reserve five stars for my absolute favorite books and one star for awful reads. I loved this book both times I read it in the past and I remember crying when I read Of Mice and Men the first time through; I remember crying after Carlson shot the old dog and I remember crying immediately after I closed the book. It's safe to say that I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book a third time just recently. Of course, I knew exactly what was going to happen during this most recent reading of the book, so I didn't cry this time around. Of Mice and Men is a favorite and I would gladly read it over and over again. It's a quick read, but it's a story that will stick with you long after you have forgotten the book is on your shelf.

B00DHNB5CY|4.0|I liked the original Evil Dead, so I had to see if the remake would be the same.  This movie surprised me because sometimes remakes don't be as good as the original ones. However, that is not the case with this one. Evil Dead is a good horror flick. It has a story line that makes sense, scary scenes that will jump you out of your seat and the blood gushing killings that real horror movies back in the day used to have. I'm glad I decided to see this movie because it did not disappoint.

B00001QEE8|4.0|Disney Studios 19th full length animated feature film from the Disney studios. The Jungle Book breathed new life into the Disney animated films after the so-so Sword in the Stone. By this time Walt was busy with other projects and had little Time to spend overseeing the animated films. The new Xerography process while being a cost saving achievement did not make these newer films better in my opinion, in fact they just don't have the Disney luster we've all become accustomed to.<br /><br />Fortunately, The Jungle Book is one of Disney's best from this time period and because of the luke warm reception of Sword in the Stone Walt had a lot more to do with this film than that one. The Jungle Book has extremely memorable characters and has some of the best songs to grace any Disney film. The animation process has been fleshed out more and the new process isn't as jarring as it seemed in Sword and the Stone. I can only imagine what this film would have looked like if it were done without the Xerography process. The artwork is beautiful in the film, but it is a totally different style. The rougher lines on the drawings being exposed just comes across like their unpolished. This process worked well with this film, Winnie the Pooh and 101 Dalmatians though, but after ending the traditional process with the fabulous looking Sleeping Beauty, (yes one scene used this process a sort of trial) these films looks very 2 dimensional and just don't seem to have the same magical look to them.<br /><br />OK, now about the film and video releases. I have owned both DVD releases and now the Blu Ray release and they all have their good points and bad points. the first release has no bonus features, but is in the superior full screen format. While the restoration isn't as impressive as the newer release, it looks very good and actually helps to soften the rough lines in the animation. The newer release has been restored and looks great, but the widescreen presentation is cramped chopping off heads and feet in some scenes. Also the rough lines are more exaggerated. The EASY solution (Disney I'm talking to YOU!) would have been to include BOTH formats.<br /><br />*****BLU RAY UPDATE******<br /><br />The new Blu Ray release looks fabulous, but it does not include the full screen version of the film.<br />This is disappointing news for purist.<br /><br />******END OF UPDATE*****<br /><br />If I had to choose one edition I would keep my Limited issue DVD as the Full Screen Film is really what's important here. I would like to see it sparkle like the new edition, but I prefer the presentation in full screen rather than widescreen. It was shown both ways in theaters so why not offer both? The film is short enough and the extras don't take up that much space.

B0023SDPS6|5.0|Rarely does one come across a novel that is not only stunningly written but so comfortable in its setting.  Mr. Johnson is entirely<br />synchronized with the grit of Wyoming--its moods, landscapes and weather are as much a part of the story as its surgically<br />drawn characters.  I fear I will get through the rest of the series far too quickly--can't remember a more enthralling read!

B00DGKQF2S|5.0|Consider the state of music as of 2013:  Bieber, Cyrus, and the tons of other image oriented so-called &#34;bands&#34;.  It's all garbage!!  If you strip away all the gloss, sheen, and prettiness all that is left should be the music, which for a lot of the mentioned &#34;Bozo's&#34;, is weak at best.  For me, keep all that image-oriented crap away, and give me bands like King's X or Winery Dogs!!  Why?  Because it's about the players, their skill, and their song writing.  Their music is a shot in the arm!!  You won't these find these guys dancing around, twerking, to pre-recorded tracks.  Instead you have three of the best world-class musicians coming together, writing very GOOD songs with lots of feeling, who know how to make their instruments sound incredible, and then play them in such a way that makes your jaw hit the floor.  I'll listening to this for a loooong time.  Do yourself a favor and OWN IT!!

B006MW3V6U|5.0|Family friendly series that is so popular no matter what gender or age.  Excellent acting and delightful script that just keeps the audience entertained and begging for more. Extremely popular show here in the USA and will no doubt be sought after for years to come.
B0055D3EFU|5.0|What an awesome movie!  Cant wait til the second one is out in the theaters.  We had never heard of this movie until we saw the advertisement for the 2nd.  Very scarey and good movie:)
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Yet another fantastic series that I simply could not stop watching all at once. Irresistible in its essence with the actors, script, costumes, furniture, etc.  I can hardly wait for season 4!
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|Not bad but not great either. It is a good time consumer. I prefer the later installments in the franchise.

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This show is so addictive! Better than having you know what!  Well, almost, I think. I will be sad when it ends.
1564148793|5.0|This book is very insightful.  I am so grateful to the author.  I used the instructions unto the Angel Micheal (pronounced Mi-ca-el  (el) meaning God).  The rituals gives protection and the book also gives clues as to the black magic that enemies can do to attack you.  It shows you how to protect and reverse but not attack (very good).  I would have liked to author to explain more about the goddess Hekate but I guess you can always buy a book concerning this goddess.  The book encourages requests to the Goddess Hekate rather early and a preliminary preview of who this goddess is would have been good.  However, as the book says, you do not have to ask this Goddess you can ask the four angels, Raphael, Gabriel, Micheal, Uriel for there help.
B009EDZGY4|5.0|I love these movies. I have a collection of cartoon movies and these are so cute. My nieces all have their favorite character within the movie and it gets so quiet when they are watching.

B00A8LRIEW|3.0|Leftover songs from Waiting for the Sirens Call that did not make the first cut.  All in all a good up tempo release for New Order.
B001FVV2X2|4.0|I like to pick up series that are a few years old so that there is a good library of material to keep me engaged for some time.  Fringe is one of the best ones I have found.  Its kind of like a modern X-files crossed with a good Cop procedural with a splash of a better executed Grimm.  I like the overarching plot line with a good dose of one off episodes.  The mad scientist character is brilliant with some pretty funny lines.
B00CTXBO9M|5.0|Highly addictive and simple game. The little doodle character starts out bouncing upward immediately, and it's your job to guide him through a myriad of platforms, traps, and other monsters...all the while trying for the best score. Easy to learn, difficult to master.
B0027YUK98|5.0|While I have long been a fan of the Beethoven symphonies/concertos, orchestral and sacred works, string quartets/trios, piano sonatas/variations and cello sonatas, I have never warmed up to the violin sonatas.  This duet has shown me why -- these sonatas are interior, delicate mediations that require a calm, inward performance style emanating from a well-rehearsed duet with a single mind.  Even when Faust/Meknikov play the spirited finale of the \\"Kreutzer\\", they play for each other, not for the public.  The clarity, alacrity, and inspired efficiency of their conceptions bring to life, paradoxically, the mystic and sacred beauty of Beethoven's genius thought.<br /><br />  Anne-Sophie Mutter and her pianist, Lambert Orkis are world-class, but they play these sonatas in a projected, exaggerated public fashion that, compared to Faust and Melnikov, come across as almost crude and show-boating; completely overrunning the fragile interior nature of these pieces. I have the utmost respect for Mutter, but her philosophical approach to these works, as with so many other violinists, unnecessarily intrudes on the music.  Faust uses a \\"less is more\\" performance style with little vibrato and no overt romantic overdrive compared to other violinists in these works.  The music seems to flow from her fingers with less noise, more content.  Melnikov's supportive pianism is all intricate grace and effortless precision. The two truly sing as one.<br /><br />  One thing I want to mention.  The Amazon Editorial Review as of this date states that the set comes with a \\"bonus DVD\\" of the duo performing the sonatas.  Perhaps that was the case in the first edition in 2009, but there is no DVD in the set I received and I find it unfair considering how much higher priced this is than other complete Beethoven violin sonatas. (I am actually planning to return the CDs and order the much less expensive Mp3s.)  Also, I have read numerous complaints about the unusual packaging, but it didn't bother me-- you can always put the CDs and booklet in a conventional 4-CD case.<br /><br />  If you love these sonatas, and especially if you don't, these entrancing Faust/Melnikov Beethoven violin sonata performances have an historic freshness and vitality to them that I think may well stand the test of time.

B0013TTLDE|5.0|I am reading my 3rd title by this author and I am enjoying her books very much.<br />An incredible 'sense of place', descriptive characters, a bit of mystery, a sense<br />of the gothic, suspense, emotion, multiple central characters, history and time travel<br />through different eras. I am very happy as a reader!
B005MMY9A8|4.0|I was really surprised to find out that this movie was directed by Kenneth Branagh. I quite enjoyed the result. I think the casting was good and the settings were beautifully done, particularly Asgard. I'm not a comic-book fan; so I have no idea how this jives with the Thor comic books. I just know that I enjoyed the movie in that light superhero action way. I think that the one thing I would have changed is Thor's banishment on Earth. It would have been more effective if it had lasted a little longer than two or three days. Still, I enjoyed the movie and I may even be willing to pay to see the sequel in the movie theater this fall.<br /><br />I watched this via streaming HD on my Kindle, and I was impressed with the picture quality and the smoothness of the playback. It works very well, and I'm glad that I had the chance to stream it as I may not have ever watched it otherwise.
B00ANDDBBE|5.0|Having seen the series on BBC America, I am thrilled to own the set.  I only own videos I intend to watch multiple times, over time.  Will be doing so with these disks. As a 45 year sci fi fan, this is a great treat.
B00CKJTOHO|4.0|Season 7 was good, and the story line was more believable and the writing more upbeat. It is terrible that will only be one more season left.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|This movie was put together by one of my favorites - Joss Whedon. He has managed to get many different characters into one cohesive movie that makes sense and is very entertaining to watch. I love the humor amid a story line that makes you wonder who is going to win. Great movie, would recommend it to all ages!
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|Not only was the plot tightly written, the characters believable and well formed  but most important for us - my husband is nearly blind and has a severe hearing loss.

B009KS4XRO|2.0|I havereally enjoyed this game until the last 4-6 weeks.  I've invested a lot in this game.  Then the purchases I made were charged to my credit card and I never received the goods.  I tried to contact customer support but I kept getting the message to try again later.  When I finally was able to get a note sent to them that was the end of it.  I have to force close the game a lot because it quits responding.  I lose credits, free games, power ups, coins etc. because the game quits responding.  I will not purchase anything from this game again.  This is sad because I really loved this game until the problems started.

140006922X|5.0|Reza Asian brings a remarkable perspective to an old discussion. Raised Muslim, an evangelical Christian convert as a teen, a Biblical scholar by avocation, he became a Muslim once again but has great respect for Jesus and his role in history.<br /><br />The reliable evidence, he argues, is that Jesus was executed by the Romans for sedition. He never claimed to have been God. He perceived himself as the &#34;messiah&#34; sent by God to redeem Jerusalem for the Jews from the Romans, during the lives of those who followed him. After the destruction of the Temple and eviction of the Hebrews, and after the execution of James, the brother of Jesus (who thought it heretical to claim Jesus was God while on earth) the faith shifted its focus entirely to the conversion of gentiles and ceased to be a Jewish cult.<br /><br />The means to achieve this were the canonization of the letters of Paul, who had been summoned to Jerusalem by James and forced to  seek forgiveness in the Temple for the same ideas latter rendered orthodox.<br /><br />The work is carefully researched, cogently argued, and respectful of both points of view. I would recommend the book to anyone interested in this era and these chronically debated historical and theological issues.

159413586X|5.0|Reading other reviews on here, I realize some are disappointed that we are introduced to new characters that die almost immediately. Isn't it important to remember, however that Katniss herself is just meeting these people for the first time as well? Not everything should go how we expect or would like because in Collins' reality of the Hunger Games, this is it - this is what happened. Katniss meets people in the rebellion that she's thrown in a squad with and, unfortunately, they're gone. That's how it is in war. Just when you get to know someone, they're taken from you.<br /><br />  I read the Hunger Games trilogy as a single story. To judge one against the other doesn't seem right since they all seem to flow with one another. That being said, I loved the conclusion to The Hunger Games. It wasn't what I expected, it's full of surprise and emotional ups and downs and it kept me turning pages until I closed the book pondering the future of Panem.<br /><br />  You can read my synopsis here.

B007K3JFUQ|5.0|Till Robert Downey jr. started Playing Sherlock Holmes, i was not a fan of his acting and now after This and the first Movie i have changed my mind (my Parents were British) so i can tell a North American attemping to do a British Accent and doing a crappy job but Robert Sounds very British in this Movie. i so enjoy this movie maybe it has to do with I love The Home of My Blood and Victorian times so this is Movie I so love was sad to see his Lady killed off.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|I bought this CD based on the glowing reviews...I'm very happy that I did! I *LOVE* the songs When The Man Comes Around & Hurt. I normally don't like remake songs (by anyone!), BUT...WOW!...Johnny sang these songs with such depth & emotion that he puts the &#34;originals&#34; to shame (sorry). Honestly, these songs touched my heart & soul...I can't stop listening to it. I searched online to hear HURT by Nine Inch Nails...they are just singing the words...Johnny lived the words & you can feel it when he sings it. I also like watching the video on You Tube. This CD includes &#34;pure&#34; Johnny songs too. This is a perfect CD. I used to quietly laugh at my mother when she listened to to this county &#34;stuff&#34; while I was listening to my &#34;top pop&#34; music & swore to myself that I would NEVER listen to classic county music...well...here I am...listening & buying it....WHY...because I now realize that these classic county singers are TRULY TALENTED & THE REAL DEAL!!! They are NATIONAL TREASURES!!!
B005544TRQ|1.0|I couldn't even make it through the first 30 minutes of the show. It is a bit silly; file away in bubble gum for the brain category.
B00CRWJ7VC|3.0|I liked the idea of the movie and I could follow. I thought the actors did a good job but it really didn't grab me .
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|Spielberg pull this one out of his hat. Actors are perfect for they're parts. Their voices and dances are amazing. Great storyline. Can't wait to watch season 2.
B007N8RULO|3.0|I play spidy on my desk top and notebook computers. I continue my enjoyment on kindle fire. How wonderful! A great way to spend time!<br /><br />.
B0094KT6T8|5.0|I saw this movie awhile back and couldn't remember if it was a good movie so I just went ahead and bought it and now I am very very happy that I did because it is an awesome movie!!
B00DH4BL8Q|5.0|Excellent book. Quite interesting. Maybe a little bit childish, but still very good. I totally loved the very end. Next series have to be good.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Keep you always wondering what would be next. Good characters with the villan and the hero battling for love. A classic story.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This absolutely fantastic book should be required reading for all 5th grade children, everywhere in the world.  It might just have the power to make this a better world if kids had to read and discuss this book. If only one child tried to be &#34;kinder than necessary&#34;, then that would change the lives that child touched.  I wish I had read this when I was a child, and I can think of some other people I wish had read it as well.
B009WHDE3C|3.0|The trailers for this film escalated my desire to purchase it.  The trailer make it seem like a comedy.  A comedy of errors, romance, etc.  It is more than that and less than that.  A good film but not really a comedy.  Just a film with some good one liners.
B008602KQI|5.0|The only problems I have with the move are small things like how the crown is given and other small moments like that, that would have taken no time to do right as to the books specifications but it seems like they just forgot and should have been looking in the book for those moments but other then things like that I can forgive say... how the pin is acquired as it is just a 2 and a half hour movie and thats the limit because of production costs and time it would take to get all those moments from the book in would result in a 8 hour movie or multiple parts and that would have taken to much time to do. So as long as you read the book I would wholeheartedly recommend this movie except for those small moments like I talked about but those are forgivable. 5/5
B00B9366VO|4.0|I'm being somewhat generous with the 4*. This is a quite good tribute documentary about the rise and fall of a great recording studio(and a parallel story of the demise of analog recording and the digital dumbing down of both recordings and music generally). You do get a very good sense of what it's like to work up musical arrangements in a studio, and Dave Grohl is a likeable guide to the studio that many fine artists in the 70's did some of their best work(Neil Young, Fleetwood Mac etc.) and Nirvana's legendary Nevermind.<br />  But the movie ran on too long, about 2/3rds of the way through it switched over into being a promo film for Grohl's latest recording project. The intent clearly morphed into a buildup for his next album, which felt a little like a commercial but overall for music junkies recommended.
B0054SMIH6|4.0|I tried to stream this movie through the Nintendo Wii and the video quality was horrible.  So pixelated I could not watch the movie so I had to pay more money to watch the movie through VUDU (much better quality and not problems).  Amazon instant video has a long way to go and it will be a while before I try it again.
B004GFN11A|3.0|If I can figure it out my blog would be some what enjoyable!<br />Maybe I can use some<br />Help please!
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|This was great animation!  I would recommend this movie as a fun night entertainment.  We will definitely watch it again!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|It kept my interest all the way through. It showed a regular family life that could have happen to anyone..
B00DBSZJRM|2.0|WOW this was a horribly bloody movie.  I thought it was going to be a little more amusing and a lot less gorry.  The actors are good, but this movie was plain gross.
B000EULJLU|5.0|I'm sure that many of the other Tool fans may disagree, but I think this is their best cd. I'm a fan as well and find all of their music to be wonderful, but this collection of songs impacts me.
B00E3UN44W|5.0|Not only was my little fangirl heart toyed with when I stumbled upon the pre order of Sherlock series three on my regular visit to the site, but now Amazon is making a point of sending me emails reminding me that we still have to wait months in agonizing wait for the first episode to air!!!!! Oh well, such is life.  There is a silver lining in the fact that the shooting of series three has just wrapped, and I get to enjoy the reviews by fellows fans with more clever and witty theories of what will eventually be on said DVD set. If the two previous series are any indication, it will be brilliant! Not only are Moffat and Gatiss fantastic writers, they're also huge Sherlock fanboys! Which is probaly why they make such exquisite programs we all enjoy.  Add to that the cast's phenomenal performances and it's no wonder we can get enough.  Just look at that teaser trailer, the emotion shown by the actors is sublime. Ok, I'll stop gushing now :)
B00EEDJM2Q|4.0|This game makes you think ahead and plan ahead for your next move.  Its deceiving in it's appearance and it looks like just a simple game, but you have to think about your move before doing it and I found it challenging and fun.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Loved the read but thought the ending went too fast!<br />Reacher is on the move again and I can't wait to read the next adventure !!
0060775858|5.0|I gave it to my granddaughter on her second Christmas.  Although she is now six and in first grade and can read, she still enjoys having it read to her at bedtime.
B0019IB26I|5.0|Good variety of John Mayer's music in a live format. Two discs included so there is also some of his blues along with other styles of music.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I waited a long time to watch and I wasn't disappointed until the end (no spoilers).  I can't wait to finish the whole series.
B006UIUJ2A|5.0|Even though this seemed unbelievable at times I found it gave a great insight into life in North Korea.<br />It was well written and page turning.
B008469DGY|4.0|To get the important note out of the way, I played this on a Kindle 8.9 HD and encountered no bugs or play issues.<br /><br />The graphics and physics of the game are nice. They feel right, including the in-flight flicks to change the ball's direction.<br /><br />I was a bit disappointed that as this was named \\"Golf\\" it doesn't really have anything to do with golf other than the name and the ostensible graphics. The \\"ball\\" could essentially be anything. You are trying to flick the screen at an appropriate length and direction to send the \\"ball\\" to a target area. A \\"hole in one\\" is really just a bull's eye. What you are doing is trying to hit a target area with progressively lower scores the further from the target your ball lands.<br /><br />Since the play is nothing like golf (only the one stroke per hole) and the scoring is nothing like golf, I can't really call this \\"golf\\".<br /><br />However, as a little hit the target game, it is OK. I seriously doubt you are going to spend a significant effort trying to master this. It's OK for an occasional way to waste time, but it didn't engage me in any manner of interest that would cause me to load it up very often.<br /><br />WARNING: The extended flicking motion partially separated the tip from my stylus. If this happened in the wrong way with some types of stylus, you could be in danger of scratching your screen. So I recommend flicking with your finger and not with a stylus. Luckily I was able to reattach my stylus tip.
B0056CUZRA|5.0|I found this well written and was amazed at the complexity of world politics. The characters are interesting and descriptions of the times is vivid.  I enjoyed this book very much even its description of the young men in battle. I have just started reading the second book in the trilogy and am already looking forward to the third.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|We watched this because it stars David Tennant & Arthur Darvill, not really knowing what it would be about.  We were on the edge of our seats more than once, and in tears as well.  Amazing writing and very fine acting.  The characters drew us in completely.  We watched the first 4 episodes of this 8-episode series in one sitting!  Looking forward to the back half.  Would recommend this to anyone who loves British shows and mystery/crime/drama.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|And I did enjoy this. Mind you, it is a sad book really because the protagonist seems to have such a sad life, both before and after the events in this book. Thinking about getting the next book in the series now!
B0031RAOVY|5.0|This is the saddest movie I have ever seen but I had to buy it! I recommend that everyone watch this movie!!!
B0064W67IM|3.0|I love Neil Gaimans work. I have the complete Sandman set in hardcopy. But liked the idea of having it on Kindle too. Well, sadly, it is not made for Kindle, unless you are using your Kindle on iPad. It is annoying to navigate the panels, and, of course, unless you have a Kindle Fire, it is all in shades of grey (No, nothing to do with 50 annoying shades of grey!).<br /><br />So, in hardcopy format, I would give Sandman a 6-star review. On Kindle, only 3 stars, and that also only because I am biased in favour of Gaiman.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|it was so crisp & clear and so easy to obtain/watch;definitely will do more. Cant wait for the time to watch more
0895260131|5.0|A whole lot of politically incorrect information. I loved it. The other side of Islam (Crusades and modern times) Muslims would rather you did not know about.
B007SGM084|5.0|I absolutely loved reading this trilogy!! I had heard many different people talk about these books, people were ranting and raving about the story but never giving anything away. I would recommend this trilogy to anyone who enjoys a little twist in their romance!! I will definitely read these again!!
B009H7SCMA|5.0|Gabriella by Alan Hardy is my type of romance humor—it's aggressive without being gawdy, it's funny without being ridiculous and it's sexy without being disgusting. It's a quick read, very well-written and makes you want to keep reading. I have never played or followed cricket before, but perhaps the sport is more interesting than I gave it credit for. Great read, looking forward to reading another by Mr. Hardy.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Fun read had suspense all around the corner. It had the action of Percy Jackson , the drama of the maximum ride(James Patterson), and (a bit of) the romance from most books. All in all, fun read for most Rick Riordan fans.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I ask my dad for minecraft and he will try and try to buy and well everyone has minecraft I LOVE MINECRAFT !
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|I like the chemistry of the actors. It seems like they really do like each other. I also like the writing, which I find smart and funny. I hate the theme song, but it is not that difficult to skip through it... :)
0425263908|5.0|I read 50 shades of gray & this book is on the tamer side. I love reading all three books!!!!!!!!1
B002WD4MLG|5.0|Great Travolta<br />Love this movie<br />Great dialogue - could watch this movie over and over again<br />one of my favorites
B0040HO01Y|5.0|The characters are well developed and most of them appealing. My one weakness is Lark Rise to Candleford. I wish there were more seasons to watch.
B002NN5F7A|4.0|Great cast - Depressing Movie<br />Mamet Dialogue pretty terfific although it seems a bit dated now - perhaps a bit too much Mamet over the year has resulted in his style of dialogue becoming cliched
B003JTHXN6|5.0|This is a great book for those who believe that an organization's culture and core values are the greatest forces to push it to next level. Read it if you're creating a new organization, dreaming of change on your current job, looking to improve your productivity, wanting to become a better teammate, building a new product or questioning if there are better ways to be happy through your work.<br /><br />This is not a management, neither a step-by-step \\"how-to\\" or a tradicional methods book. It requires you to believe that counter-intuitive solutions can lead to better results and that we work better when happy.<br /><br />Although it's interesting to get to know the author's path before joining Zappos, the book really catches on when it presents all the decisions behind the company's culture and values. Along with the authors perspectives, there are many e-mails and other member's insights that reflects the way Zappos created such a successful business.
B007THA4FI|5.0|Wonderful book filled with deep quirky characters who  repel the reader as well as mesmerize.  Exactly the well woven story we have come to expect from this author!
0500512159|5.0|pics pics pics pics pics and more pics. great for sneaker heads of any level, more shneakers than you can throw a cat at.
B000002TYX|4.0|I'm luckily finding these volumes used and cheap. In fact I picked up this one for one crisp dollar. The first of the series is, to me, the most interesting because I enjoy learning about the genesis of famous rock bands. Once they become rich and famous they also become boring.<br /><br />Anthology 1 contains key moments in the history of the Beatles. Recordings by The Quarrymen, the Decca demos, the Sheridan sessions, tracks that include Sutcliffe and Best, select live performances including the first Ed Sullivan appearance, along with brief interviews with Lennon, McCartney and Brian Epstein create an aural early history of the Beatles.<br /><br />The much bally-hooed \\"reunion\\" track, Free As A Bird, is only mildly interesting because of the studio trickery that was used to bring all four Beatles (Lennon via an old solo demo) into the studio again. It's a throwaway oddity.<br /><br />Some of disc 2 begins to wander a bit into early takes and \\"sequence\\" tracks that attempt to illustrate the creative process in the studio. These tracks are only mildly interesting, and are a foreshadow of tracks that fill volumes 2 and 3. Those volumes also dispense with interviews - a mistake in my opinion. I like the concept of an aural history, and that is lost on subsequent volumes.<br /><br />So I vote for this as the best Anthology disc of the three.
B00785P2QC|1.0|The game is advertised as free, but play is very limited unless you start buying the in-game offers. &#34;FREE&#34; is just a ruse to get you started in the game so they can sucker you into buying stuff to continue playing. I will never play another game by G5.
B00DHRLK84|4.0|I loved the fact that this movie, which came under intense scrutiny during its arduous production phase, emerged as a great popcorn summer horror movie.  By focusing on the humans in the story, and creating a few incredibly effective set pieces (the apartment building; the plane; the medical center), World War Z may not be the book, but it's a very fun, very scary movie that grabs hold from its first horrifying moments. Brad Pitt plays the everyman lead with expressive appeal, and the narrative, while sometimes ridiculous, never fails to provide some surprise that adds to the tension and thrills as it moves swiftly to a predictable conclusion.  Bravo!
0547884591|2.0|Admittedly, I've only read the first chapter and skimmed the rest, but find it difficult to become involved in this book.  It seems like the author has made an attempt at dumping rote procedures onto us and saving us from having to learn any skill or theory on anything that he presents.  In doing so, he insults all of us for being human beings who crave understanding and depth of experience.  Some, who prefer the checklist, flowchcart and procedure method to life may find this book useful.  In the future, I will stick to single-subject books that teach me the theory and leave the rest up to my own intuition and creativity.
B0042ESTQW|3.0|Maybe I'm used to heavy duty smartphone cases, like Otterbox.  This is pretty thin silicone rubber, and it surely can protect against scratches, but I don't see this as providing any protection from impact if the Edge flies off the bike and goes skittering across the asphalt.  I'll keep it, but am not showing it off to my cycling friends as a &#34;you gotta buy this&#34; item.
B006PYHYXG|5.0|the arm dose exactly what it is supposed to do.  If you are looking for an extension arm for your ergotron system this is it.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|I really enjoy this type of game the tasks are varied enough to keep you interested and the graphics are really detailed and well presented.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love this app get the app it is a good app it is the best ever vet the app get the app get the app get the app the app is so so so so  so cool  and awesome
B00AQMSJI2|4.0|I have been playing for a week now, I am addicted to the game. I love expand your island and the quest are simply enough to complete. only thing I do t think after buy so many workers, the price gets higher and higher from them. but I keep playing anyways.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is telly fun not too hard not to easy but a good app you should get this app . Iloce this app so much and you will too ,and if you want to get to ride on the hover borad tipe the screen twice
B0054JZC6E|4.0|as a family its fun to play. we take turns playing and sharing. my kids and myself have a lot of fun with these games
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|I bought this book because it was my bookclub's selection; the person who selected it had taken classes at Second City when Tina Fey was there.  She thought the book was hilarious.  I have a good sense of humor but this book just wasn't very funny.  There was one part where I did laugh out loud, but otherwise, it was just okay.  Not sure I understand what all the hoopa is about.  Did  Tina Fey really win the Mark Twain Prize BEFORE Carol Burnett?  How?
B007PTJOV0|5.0|No glitches no nothing! its perfect!!! love it love it love it!!!! i adore it. it is SO addicting! Please get it! I reccomend it for everyone!!
B001NHNG64|5.0|I so enjoyed this heart pounding thriller, racing through to see if Reacher would in fact foil his foes! My husband even commented on how absent I was reading it/ignoring him!
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|Its ok but on world 2 level 5, it kept screwing me over and making me run backwards.. other than that i really enjoy the app. it is really fun. please fix the glitch(es)
B00CH87HF4|5.0|This is an excellent role player game. It explains most of itself at the beginning and then you have a&nbsp;small learning curve after they leave you on your own. Great treasure hunting and even when you die you still get to keep items you collected.<br />It's a great game and I enjoy playing it.
B000ASATZ8|5.0|Since I was a kid, I have liked these movies. I got this set for my dad. I think the trilogy goes together well, so if you want all three films, this is good to get.
B003B02O7I|5.0|I,m fascinated with the range of subjects John Grisham writes about.  Each book has a legal theme but  still manages to have a completely absorbing story within it.  This is a wonderful book and I recommend it highly.
0380778556|1.0|If you like run on sentences with 25 adjectives per sentences you will love this book. Not my thing! Would not recommend.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Love having this option, but Facebook is not the same as viewing it on your laptop.  But all in all, I am glad that I have it.
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|Great movie with a great cast and great fun. If you liked the first one you should definitely check this out.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love having this app on my Kindle Fire.  Pinterest is so addictive!  Download was very easy and it was free!
B008Y2IU12|5.0|Love the actor/ the hunstman !! Can see it many times, definitelly will recommend it to buy or rent it better buy it
B00DU74U74|5.0|It was a great movie.  I started reading the book, then heard about the movie so I watched it. Still have not finished the book yet.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like the graphics for this game, but there are some problems with the tack showing up on the horse on my version. Maybe it didnt download properly or something because I have a kindle that I downloaded it onto and it works just fine.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Truly entertaining read...loved it! Very clever and read it in one day. Again Mr. Gaiman does not disappoint the reader.
B00EEDJM2Q|4.0|This is a fun and fast timed game...it makes me think....it helps me to concentrate and block out the background noise of life.....a great free diversion that hurts no one... a good replacement therapy.
B008469DGY|5.0|You play for points not strokes.  It only takes a couple of minutes to get the hang of \\"flicking\\".  It's a great FAOTD.<br /><br />I have the kindle fire hd 8.9. I found no problems.
B006IGZWB2|4.0|Hard to watch, but touching story of life in the south during that era. It was a good movie to watch.
B0011EU0NG|5.0|Very entertaining for all ages.  Great music and good story.  The actors are of the highest calibar.  Love Dick Van Dike.
0425263924|1.0|What an enormous waste of my time. I re read the first two to refresh my memory, and had forgotten how good they were. This one... Wow... Sylvia Day should write a retraction... For the entire book. From start to finish its very clear she had absolutely NO idea where to take this story. No plot, no point, no nothing. She hints to another in a letter to the reader at the end.. Almost like an apology for it being so awful. Tell me you have an idea for this one Sylvia... And not just an excuse to try to compete with FSoG and write some explicit sex scenes... AWFUL.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This was one of the best books I have ever read.  I've recommended it to friends of all ages and think everyone will learn something from this story.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I picked up the first book in 1994 in a used book store.  I continued to read until I caught up with the author and then waited sometimes years for the next book.  Some of the books got a little tedious but I stuck with it.  Then Robert Jordan passed away with out finishing the story.  I tought I would never find out what happened but Jordan's wife found someone to put the rest of the story into publication.  I was in my 40's when I started and am now in my early 60's but it was well worth the wait.  Today, you can read all 14 books without the wait but it is well worth the effort.  Enjoy!!!
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Very funny book. Was not disappointed by one of my favorite writers. Everything Tina Fey touches is gold in my opinion
1568363931|3.0|The recipes are a little too intense for us.  We need quick recipes.  However, the pictures provide lovely options for packing.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|So boring. No plot worthy of all the endless porn you have to read through. Bought this at the suggestion of several friends but I couldn't even finish it. I found it so boring. Besides, it's 2013, if porn is what you're looking for you certainly don't have to READ it lol
0064471837|5.0|Garth Nix is a fantastic author - Sabriel introduces the reader to Nix's incredibly imaginative world, the Old Kingdom. His descriptions really bring the world to life, and the story and great pace keep you drawn in, unable to put down the book (as if bound by Saraneth!)<br /><br />A must buy for any fans of the fantasy genre, and for anyone looking for a gripping and exciting read, not without subtle touches of humour.
B008NEVPCC|5.0|I initially purchased for my young nieces. Pleasantly surprised that the music is great and there are no profanities. Appropriate for pre teens. It is everyone's favorite CD now! The kids and mine too : )
B00ELD3MUW|1.0|It would not work on my kindle. I was still not able to watch any videos on the kindle and I kept getting errors telling me the Flash installer has stopped working
B009AJDDQU|4.0|Sorry but I am biased towards the sci-fi genre so I will just say it is good to me.  Excellently acted and also top notch special FX.
B001AQR3JY|5.0|This is my favorite disney movie. Perfect condition. No bent corners and DVD plays perfectly. Not a lot more to tell.
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|This movie was very well put together. Very good screenplay mixed with a script that is out of this world. combine those two with such an amazing cast, and you have a movie that is like candy for both the eyes and ears. I enjoyed the use of naration that came straight from the book. the only issue I have is with a small detail that was changed from the book to the movie. other than that i feel like they captured the book in a way no other director has been able to do thus far. the sound track was magical in many ways. though it did not fit with the era of the movie its self it was placed well enough to keep the audience of this day and age engaged and enjoying it. and the cinematography was hands down some of the best i have seen. mixed with great editing and scoring this movie was a masterpiece made from heaven. and is a must watch!
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Its a Pretty good clock but the sounds are too soft for me. I only use the loud noises. Fun...
B00AIUUXHC|2.0|I didn't like this spp very much. I only played 2 times and then I decided to delete it. Don't get it
B003O86FMW|5.0|The characters were developed with near perfection.  The new arena was quite a construction; the visuals that come to mind while reading quite vivid.
B004AKCME8|5.0|Great movie very prophetic! The whole family loves watching the owls over and over.  Wish they made a part two.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Enjoyed this book very much. It is a fairly quick read but ambitious too. There is a lot of action and an interesting and different premise. I plan on reading the next group of books in this series.
B002DOSBMK|5.0|I love this book! And typing out why I love it would take to long so just try it! Seriously
B005V20JKI|2.0|I unlocked the Castle level, but it won't let me play until I buy an upgrade.  I used to love this game.  Progress was deleted when I had to reset my phone, so I waited a bit and downloaded it again.  Now it is ridiculously short.  Used to be great.
B005EWDA9M|5.0|Murakami and seaside in autumn - perfect match! Thank You! This experience will haunt my life! Changed my perception, simplified questions!
B00005JMJ4|1.0|There are almost 2000 reviews of this movie here. With that kind of sample, the customer review graph of stars awarded is very telling.<br /><br />The media reviews and promotion for this movie defy reality in ways I've not previously seen. Peter Travers from Rolling Stone said, \\"Flat out hilarious!\\", but not about the movie as the DVD cover misleads you to believe, but about one mildly funny scene. The exclamation mark is a fabrication for the movie's promotion. But Travers does say \\"...Sophia Coppola's altogether remarkable .. class-act ...\\", which is just as flat out hilarious! And even funnier than that is that this almost completely improvised movie won Sofia Coppola a \\"Best Original Screenplay\\" Academy Award! If you ever doubted Hollywood was a suck-up kind of town, doubt no longer.<br /><br />In the final unscripted scene, Bill Murray says something to Scarlett Johansson that we don't hear because it wasn't in the script and the screenwriter couldn't come up with a line. She couldn't find a line because in her mind no line existed. As director she wanted the scene, but as screenwriter she had nothing. And for coming up with nothing in the most important scene in the movie, she got the Oscar, when every other writer would have got the sack. There's only one good explanation for that - Executive Producer : Francis Ford Coppola.
B006M4F67A|5.0|Entertaining, works brain cells, interesting, challenging, winnable(beatable)...but does take consentration, enjoyable...bottom line, this game provides FuN while helping maintain metal wellness
075669910X|5.0|This book is an amazing value. The information combined with fantastic photographs make it a favorite of mine and my seven year old son. Can't say enough.

B004GCPJDQ|2.0|The unit disconnects and reconnects itself all the time randomly. makes us not want to use it.<br /><br />Didnt meet expectations at all.
B00AW8UK0K|4.0|I've been doing the diet now for about 9 weeks.  My cholesterol has come down, I've lost weight which I was hoping wouldn't happen as I'm thin enough and I enjoy the rest from full on eating.  The book is well laid out, Michael Mosley's story is interesting and he explains the science of fasting well.  For someone who wants to lose weight with ease I'd definitely recommend this. There's much less of a feeling of deprivation than with other diets.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Amazing book kept me on the edge of my seat. I can't wait to read the next couple of books.
B00BHMF578|5.0|This is a a great film!  The story, cast, and production are all top notch.  What a home run performance by Ben Affleck.
B00A7KKPDK|5.0|Everything about this book is flawless. I can reread a chapter, and read it out loud to my friends and family and without fail every time tears of laughter are streaming down my face! It's definitely the best purchase I've made in the history of life. It's the best thing since sliced bread! Ellen outdid herself again!
B0047WJ12K|1.0|A completely ridiculous and completely unbelievable story that's impossible to follow.  A complete waste of Dicaprio's and Page's talents.  Don't waste your time on this one.
B009Z5BPZK|5.0|Buy it all you Gossip Girl fans out there. A must have for your Gossip Girl Collection!!! Do enjoy it!!!
B00D6B4PUG|5.0|This is one of those apps that help you quickly check your mail from a cell phone or a IPad. It get's you to the business end of the app so you can answer or compose without a lot of extra motion. Good Stuff.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|I love this game! But it has its pros and cons. Pro: the gameplay isn't repetitive and I love the powers that some of the characters have. Fabulous graphics and the one con: uses up too much space. Some of the other Angry Birds do use up a large amount of space, so the one thing that would make it better ia if it used less space. I still love this game anyway.
B003TH14H4|5.0|I like this show . The story line is an attention grabber . I'm looking forward to season 6 .I hope the writers have another successful season.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This best game I have ever played on my kindle love it love it love<br />Wish there were more games like it best strategy of played on my kindle hours and hours of non stop fun
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I absolutely enjoyed this book. The story centers around an envelope marked \\"To be opened only in the event of my death\\" that a husband left for his wife years earlier, forgot about, and while on a business trip, his wife accidentally discovers it.  The writing flows like everyday conversations, the story line is something we are able to relate to in our everyday lives. The secret impacts 3 other families directly and indirectly , without giving you too many details , the story rides a road thru life that you realize how different things may have been if you had turned left instead of right.  Great read. Believable characters. Flowing conversations. Twists you don't see coming.  The one thing I loved about this book was the epilogue , which others on this site have referenced also, it continues with the storyline showing how lives would have changed if one little thing here or there had been different, if one little tiny decision had been made differently , if the characters had chosen to say something different etc .... Highly recommend it and for the price it's a book you'll kick yourself for not reading.<br /><br />Short Review:<br />GREAT story + GREAT character development + Easy read + GREAT price = READ IT !
B000M341QO|5.0|The cast couldn't have been better suited for this movie with a lot of famous faces popping up that were not listed on the DVD! Top notch acting across the board with big props to DiCaprio and Damon! It's a fast paced non-typical Cops vs Mob movie that will have you wondering who the good and bad guys really are til the end and even after? Pretty bloody and moves fast so don't look away or you might get lost! Luckily for a girl I enjoy this type of movie or maybe it's just a Matt Damon thing! ***Grin***  I did have to squint at a few of the super bloody shooting scenes! :-)<br />Enjoy!!
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|This series of shows has great animation, has added new characters, and has more of all things about sheep  that get into everything--and do a lot of hilarious stuff. My entire family is hooked on watching an episode of this each evening. Blitz the dog does a lot of human like things--until you pickup a stick to toss or bone that needs burying.<br /><br />Again, one of the funniest shows about and clean family entertainment.<br /><br />The highest possible rating. Can't wait for season 3!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game! It gets challenging but I really do love it. The levels are fun and time consuming. It is really fun.
B00CLT31D6|5.0|Great information, well written. I enjoyed this very much! This is a real eye opener as to who you would think is a millionaire...we can all reach this status if we quit borrowing and pay for things in cash.
0061122416|5.0|Beautiful and very motivational.  Loved every page. One book I actually looked forward to reading every night. I definitely will be reading this book over and over and definitely read it to my son.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Love this series! It arrived early and in good condition. The price was excellent,low compared to many other sites. Now I am hooked!
B00DU73T08|5.0|I absolutely love Stephanie Meyers. I have read all of books. I actually did it the right way this time. I watched the movie first and then read her book. It is much better that way you are not disappointed. Thanks Stephanie!!
B00D8WM3MU|5.0|Musical Production, and lyrics are on point.  This is definitely Cole's best album, and you can see his maturity and skill on this album.
B00BUADSMQ|4.0|Not as good as the 3rd or 4th in series but entertaining action packed from start to finish. two words
B002GHIPYI|4.0|These head phones are doing the trick for me for an entry level pair of head phones.  Using them in a studio application.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I don't like how you can't change your skin but the game is awesome. Me and my cousin play it every time i come over. I really want 0.7.5 or 0.7.6. I wonder if they are going to come out with mods?
B00E6Z0THE|5.0|Let me begin. by saying I really did enjoy this point and click game but found it to be rather frustrating on a couple of points.  There is a map labled with references but these same references are not in the game.  You have to get well into the game before you get well acquainted with the different areas of the game.  There is also a hint guide that is sometimes confusing.  Again after you get into the game these become a bit easier to understand.  There is A LOT of back and forth between the different areas so be prepared for that.  Having said all that if you enjoy these types of games this is a must have.  Don't give up on it.  It is a lengthy game and more than worth the $$ you will pay for it.  A very clever search and seek experience.  Good Luck'
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|LOVE this game it very addictive great way to pass the time......pick up the tablet  and play for hours on hours ....always fun to play
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Easy but addictive fun. For the beginner or for someone who wants to just relax and zone out for a bit.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|One of the best kindle fire apps it works amazingly well without draining your battery. and the music is fantastic.
B00AFEX83C|5.0|Love this move!!! Wanted my 7 yr old to love it as much at my 15 yr old loved it back then.
0143124544|4.0|&#34;Before You&#34;  was surprisingly good.  It is one of those books that you just can't put down. I didn't give it 5 stars because it's not in the same league as &#34;The Grapes of Wrath&#34; or &#34;Exodus&#34; literature.  Still, it was one of my favorite reads so far this year.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|Book lagged in some places and dragged at the end.  Very easy reading with predictable outcome. Read for Book Club.
140006922X|5.0|Somehow I never learned much about the several hundred years either side of the beginning of the common era. In reading Zealot I was forced to go back in time and reaquaint myself with a slew of reference material that has been gathering dust on my book shelves for years. The history is there for anyone who is interested enough to read Zealot and make his or her own mind up, I Made my mind up long ago and see no reason to change it
B00124LYHQ|4.0|Fantastic acting by Leigh, Brando, Hunter and Malden. Although I enjoyed Blue Jasmine and Blanchett and Baldwin are good, They don't hold a candle to the cast of Streetcar. They just don't make them like they used to
B00ESY77LO|1.0|A lot of glitz with terrible acting and very little plot. Poor Fitzgerald. Stick to the original movie. The less said the better.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I play it on my kindle fire hd and i love it... its extreamly addictive and fun to play even if i had to pay for it i probably would
B008IJT0CE|5.0|The ease of use and almost infinite variations make this an awesome app. The sounds are realistic and so customable! It would be nice if it rotated its display with the Fire's orientation though...
0345803493|5.0|I couldn't wait to read this after reading the first book.  It got even better as I got further into it.
B008XG1X18|3.0|Still looking for a way to delete the things on the site I don't want. Theres' too much other stuff to wade through to get to what you actually want to look at.
B004LWZW7O|4.0|This movie was way better than expected, it is set in the future where people live in different timezones depending on their wealth, and currency has been replaced by how many years you can live, so for example one rich man has a safe containing a device that stores the first million years that he made ! A well acted plot with an interesting storyline. Woven in there is also an allegory of current society and how we give up part of our lives for money they just take it to the next level. Well worth spending the time !
B000FC1HBY|5.0|There is not much I can say bad about this book in general.  It is just as good as the first.
B000OCXIDK|4.0|Great book. As expected and quick. Seems to be a good vendor.  I would buy from them again. good luck.
B007GCY8FS|2.0|Read first third of the book with anticipation waiting for the kick-butt Reacher I'm used to and it never happened.  Then it started going downhill fast.  Not typical Lee Child and I can't seem to finish it, a few pages here and there.  Dissappointing but more than ready to give \\"Never Go Back\\" a chance.
B008JFC6F0|2.0|I bought this CD on the strength of \\"Elephant\\".  Having heard it via the commercial on TV, I was pretty floored by the tune.  I started to play it in my car and had forgotten for a moment who was blasting from my speakers.  I couldn't believe how bad it was! The only good song on the CD is \\"Elephant\\".  The rest of the CD sounds absolutely nothing like that song.  Very disappointed.  Not that I would expect every song to sound the same, but come on!  Anyone want to buy it from me?
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I had seen the movie and couldn't wait to read the book... it was great!! Even better than expected, it was  a great buy!!
B00DPKQ60A|5.0|It's really good even though it sounded a bit generic at times like I already hear enough of it from Chris Brown and from what I would hear on the radio. But I do hear some old school/mariah influences on it. Her voice also kinda reminds me of Paula Deanda. I really like Daydreamin, The Way, Baby I, and Honeymoon Avenue. Tattooed Heart reminds me of Mariah's Emotions album. Almost is Never Enough reminds me the days of Boyz II Men. Very nice and soothing, but a bit boring. Some noted that it's a carbon copy of Mariah's Never Forget You. Then again, Never Forget You sounds  like a carbon copy of like Boyz II Men's I'll Make Love To You/End of The Road combined. The only song I didn't really cared for was Popular Song, not really my cup of tea. Otherwise, go out, buy, and support this album! It totally beats Miley, Selena, and Demi in the dust. It's very refreshing to have a TV star with a great vocal talent and she's a very beautiful, sweet little girl with a cute speaking voice. She definitely offers something new to the table with that voice alone. I'll be looking forward to hear her second album if she ever decides to make one in the future.
B0040I09RM|2.0|Far too graphic for my tastes.  Scene where they burn a tattoo off a mans back with a blow torch immediately put an end to our viewing.
B0083EW97W|5.0|Liked pretty much all the music on this one.  Mayer continues to progress with his songwriting. Particularly liked the title track and Whiskey, Whiskey, Whiskey.
B00BB8OHMW|5.0|As an old college English major, I loved this movie! If you think that you are just going to watch a Shakespearean play, think again. The whole movie is set when Shakespeare about 30 years old and is in London as a young, struggling playwright. He spots a beautiful young girl who has come with Queen Elizabeth I's party of 20 courtiers to see a play produced by a rival playwright. Well, of course, the two of them end-up meeting and falling in love, but as luck would have it, the Queen herself offers a &#34;reward in gold coin&#34; to see a play that really portrays the good AND the bad sides of true love. As time runs out for our &#34;two star-crossed lovers&#34;, Shakespeare and his lady-love find themselves caught-up in a story as equally romantic and dangerous as Shakespeare's new play he is writing, called &#34;Romeo & Juliet&#34;, a play that Shakespeare has promised to write for the Queen's contest. Can this tale of &#34;love and woe&#34; end happily or not? It is fast paced, true to its time, and you can see for yourself what happens &#34;when two stars collide in love and war&#34;...
B00BEZTMQ8|4.0|The package arrived with a damaged case, but it is still functional, so I kept it.  I like the movie fine - typical Peter Jackson fare.  The main objection is him making a single book into multiple films, but I knew that before purchasing.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|I really like this Marware Vibe case.  Very classy looking, light-weight, and allows my Kindle to stay propped open on a table or my lap, exactly as the photo illustration shows.  I have my Kindle placed in it so that the charging ports are to the outside, so that I do not have to keep the cover/case open while recharging.  I am very pleased with this product.
0385528787|5.0|Five Stars<br />MaddAdam is exactly what the followers of this trilogy were looking for. This book ties all the ends together for us. It's masterful, and shows how well planned out this series was! I got the ARC on Netgalley and was planning to have my review up as soon as it was released but I'm so excited to finally have all my thoughts together.<br /><br />O&C really have us the basis to this story. We learn about Crake, and Jimmy and the whole world. Then we wait and wait, and finally Year of the Flood comes in and we meet more characters, the gardeners, a whole bigger world. We experience things more emotionally, it's stronger then O&C and it hurts more too.<br /><br />Finally, MaddAdam comes along, allow a final conclusion. It's a slow beginning but it picks right up where both books left off. Picks it up and starts tying it together. Each strand has been previously addressed and now we're hearing the stories. The stories of Zeb, the Stories of Adam, and the stories of Crake. We are finally getting all the little pieces to come to together and we start to have glimpses of what the whole picture really looks like. We've seen fragments, and some have been happy, others are sad, but we've been awaiting the full picture.<br /><br />MaddAdam is similar to Year of the flood in the way it's broken apart by stories like YotF was broken apart by the feast days in Toby's journal. I adore the idea of the folk tales, of the Crakes learning of themselves and of their world through these tales.<br /><br />Overall, this novel was wonderful, made me sob like a baby with Margaret Atwood's amazingly emotional storytelling and reminded me why I love her books so much. This is a stratifying conclusion to the whole trilogy, and though it's different, because it's told by different people and in a different section of time, it still resonates clearly with both of the previous books, and keeps the story arch strong and consistent! I really loved it, and am prepared to start all over again so it doesn't have to end.<br /><br />** I was given this book through NetGalley as a reviewer. **again so it doesn't have to end.<br /><br />** I was given this book through NetGalley as a reviewer. **
B00CLZ48FA|5.0|This was a great trip back to OZ. Very good 3D and the effects were excellent as well. Story was good and let us see what happened before Dorothy made her trip over the rainbow.
B00D23GXB2|4.0|***Review has been done in conjunction with Nerd Girl Official. For more information regarding our reviews please visit our Fansite: [...] ***<br /><br />Don't let the title or author name throw you, like it did for me at first. Using Greatest Poet Alive as a pen name is definitely a bold move and can throw some people off, but overall this is a very sensual, interesting collection of poetry. The author does write sensual, erotic poems in this collection but it's also made up of some smart poetry, with very emotional themes and complex prose. The author doesn't just put himself in the erotic genre and forget to include other things as well. It's a pretty well varied collection and prose and poetry. I'm not a very big fan of the erotica genre in the way of novels, I usually try to avoid them unless they really peak my interest. I try to keep an open mind though, and I'm glad I did. Though under normal circumstances, I wouldn't pick this book up at the bookstore, based soley on the cover, blurb and title, but reading it, I can appreciate a writer who has a solid grasp on prose and poetry and is able to weave his subject matter to interest and entertain the reader. GPA did that.<br />This book isn't offensive, unless the whole complete and total idea of sex offends you, then yes, you should probably move on, but for the rest of us, this well crafted collection offers just enough of the passion and sensuality, without beating you in the head with over explicit things put into poetry form. Everything the author puts into his poetry is needed, well thought out and helps deepen the meaning or enhance the imagery.<br />Overall, I enjoyed this collection of poetry for what it was. I'd say it's worth picking up if you are at all interested in things deal with passion, sensuality, sex, love, and the physical side of relationships.<br />** I was given a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review **
B00E3UN44W|5.0|Don't get me wrong, I will watch this show forever but I got really thrown for a loop when Lestrade got a sex change. It was for Mycroft and all, which is great, but I really missed Rupert Graves. Neve McIntosh does a great job though. I think she picked up Lestrade's character beautifully.
B00CXVX1OQ|1.0|Not a lot to do, it's just the same thing over and over again. Tap the button, soon the other side, tap some more. That's the gist.
B0019IB0II|4.0|It gets a little boring, but it's pretty amazing what Jill goes through. Encourages you to look at life in a whole new perspective.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is fun, challenging, full of surprises, frustrating.  We love the game except we have had difficulty finding direction for the different levels.  They may be there , we might not have found them yet.
B008469DGY|5.0|This game is so much fun. I LOVE playing it and it just keeps getting better with each course that is unlocked.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|This movie is a mess. First Tom Hanks movie I see that's is awful. I didn't like it at all.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I love that this is just like the original card game.  And that you can win without having to purchase anything.
B000J10ER4|5.0|Brandon Routh  was a great follow-up to the earlier movies.  He kept the same style and attitude in this movie as the previous Superman Movies portrayed Superman, without the need for all the \\"dark, goth, and sinister\\" elements that most of the directors nowadays feel that the \\"feel good\\" movies need to be transformed into.  Ultimately, I loved this movie.
B008OW1S3O|5.0|This album blows my mind. It's so creative, unique and definitely like nothing else out there right now. Alt J doesn't want to be labeled with a specific genre of music and that's how it should be, since they cross all kinds of musical boundaries. Joe Newman's voice is so incredible and haunting. The lyrics are deep but backed up by catchy beats and riffs. I had the luck of seeing them live in Seattle, and they're perfectly mesmerizing live as they are on their record. This album is on constant rotation with me and I can't get enough of it.
B000059XUI|5.0|What can I say?  I love Superman.  Christopher Reeves was great as usual and portrayed the man of steel just as he should have been.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I was skeptical because the narrator is death in Nazi Germany...but I balled my eyes out.  I was and am shocked at how much I loved this book.  Hats off to the author!
B000IJ79UW|5.0|I was still just as entertained re-watching this as I was the first time I saw it on the big screen.  The scenery and people looked a little dated but oh well...it was the late 70's.  I recommend the movie.
B00BJA2VFW|1.0|Have downloaded this game, already use my 199 coins, and it want let play or its completely have tried every day since I purchase it.<br /><br />I don't know whats going with it but now I don't want to delete it but can't get to work!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I read a lot of Hollacaust books. not that I like the subject, but because one must remember. and there are times when I just have had too much. like I feel I can't read another one...at least for now. but when this one came my way I reluctantly took it up and was great surprised. the write was one of the most original I have ever read on the subject and pace was amazing. Even when some phrases are reiterated they never slowed the good. It was an incredible wow of a read!
B0040I09RM|5.0|Never watched this when it first came out because thought it was going to be your normal stereotypycal type biker story.  Very addictive!  Characters that you can understand where they are coming from and twist in the plots that you would not normally anticipate.<br /><br />GOOD JOB!
B00E978FGQ|5.0|Now you see me in my opinion had a nice pace throught the movies that we can follow. The camera did not bounce around too fast and it wasn't slow so as to be boring. There was awesome characters, plot, special effects, action, twists. I was very satisfied after renting this film on demand. I always check amazon now to see what we the people will give a film out on dvd. I will simply not watch a movie if it gets lower than 4 stars. Trust me if you looking for a decent film that will not leave a bad taste in your mouth rent this! I actually wish there was a second one because after watching this I wanted more... Thanks for reading. Godbless<br /><br />~shauns movie review
B009LGO88E|5.0|got this piece of equipment for Monster Hunter mainly. its much better then using the virtual D pad or the new auto lock on in my opinion
B000IFQLBE|5.0|Got my CD right away, perfect condition. It is a must have while traveling in my car! I highly recommend
B0057UAE54|5.0|Frampton is the greatest. I love this album. It is a must have for any child of the '70s. Love it.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|haven't tried others but this is great.  estimates of remaining power are fairly accurate. the app is free, it's simple to use and you can quickly see with a glance the remaining time estimates.
B003SJ6W4I|5.0|My daughter loves this movie. It really is too funny. This is the second one we ordered, because the other is so scratched it wont play. Brendon Frazier is hilarious.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|There are so many ways to play this game that you never get bored with it.  It's amazing how your eyes play tricks on you trying to find a match. The blocks are so different,or so you think,yet it,s difficult to find the right one...Good luck!  Play until your eyes cross.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|And that is saying a lot! London was one of the most prolific writers in history. His fame was more due to his short stories (To Build A Fire) than novels, but The Call of the Wild is where most of his fame came from.<br /><br />Short stories, novels, poetry, autobiographical, plays and essays showed the depth and breadth of his talent.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|This made my Kindle that much better. It is hard to work off of but nice to make small updates on or to look at things. Works real well with the Cloud and my computer to Kindle items.
B008Y768XO|5.0|Great movie for the family movie night.  Kids loved it, althought very sad at times. Would recommend watching it thanks
B00CWY76CC|4.0|A couple of scenes were VERY challenging but for most part I enjoyed this one -- Am a sucker for hidden object games--- they are hard to find that work well on Kindle Fire..this worked fine.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|Shipped on time.  It is functional and meets the purpose for which it was intended.  Although a stylus is not needed, I thought I would get one for my Kindle Fire HD.  It would be nice if the future models would have a stylus holder.  Although, this may drive the cost of the product upward.  The low price was a consideration of my purchase. It protects my Kindle and that is important enough.
B00ECUX7HC|5.0|This could have have titled Susan Tedeschi and the Trucks Band, Susan is all over the the happiest blues you'll ever hear. and DT is without a doubt the best slide guitarist around... mix in the rest if the band you have a super super release.
B008P1EWIM|4.0|I just got this app, and like it a lot. It does all that it claims,and is easy to configure.  The app looks good on the screen,and I plan to leave it on and open,,as a source of time and weather. It is money well spent.
B00DF92E7U|5.0|Stills is in great form - great to hear him in the blues again. KWS - a perfect matchup he just keeps getting better and better, Barry Golberg, as bluesey as ever, this is just a great collection of blues!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Read reviews, seen it had lots and lots of good to excellent reviews. I have been playing almost non stop... Needless to say I found the reviews to be correct. Addicting comes to mind.
B008602KQI|5.0|This movie really lives up to the hype. I will watch again. It makes me want to read the book now.
B0053O89JM|3.0|The last season for me just isn't up to it's usual qualtity & the final eposide just didn't end the show that well, at least for me.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|I loved it until just as Matthew starts really developing deep chemistry with his wife, brother & sister in law, you have to kill him off.
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|Horrible piece of software. I would never recommend this to anyone. My ad-ware and virus software went crazy and even worse than that its and alarm and didn't do the one and only thing an alarm needs to do, Wake me up! Because of that alone I would give it one star.
B00COHIFQS|2.0|Started out promising, very creepy, but last 3rd goes straight downhill. (Jessica Chastain's terrible haircut is very distracting btw) The ending played like a bad children's movie,  and everyone will probably end up in jail, based on the terrible outcome.  Not worth watching
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I love the costumes, settings-everything is beautiful. The plots keep you involved sometimes predictable but nonetheless enjoyable. I always look forward to watching the next episode.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I have used this to choose, buy and ask for refund. It gives excellent choice of buying options, transparency and accountability.
B00821OX98|5.0|I started watching this show sporadically in the past and having the chance to catch the back stories and get caught-up is wonderful.
B004GFN11A|5.0|I use this from my android phone to post updates, delete trash comments quickly. It doesn't have the options of sharing posts though to the best of my knowledge.
B005LAII44|5.0|Myself and my sons loved this movie and were really looking forward to it coming.When we got it and tried to play it , it was blocked as it was for the American market not the Irish one. I kept it and played it on laptop which is not the same , so had to buy cable to connect to tv, all in all loved movie NOT happy with service.
1572816295|5.0|As a lover and collector of Tarot I find these cards just divine, Paulina brings the tarot to life with her magnificent artwork and delightful characters, a must for any Tarot user or collector.
B000MZHW40|5.0|Great educative true life experiences film.  I work in Compliance and my daily desk job  has to do with ensuring the 'bad' people of this world do not use our bank as a channel. Gave meaning to my job and the impact getting it right brings along.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This is my favorite game.  I play all the time and it's challenging.  Can't get enough!  It's never the same twice, and I try to bet my old scores.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|I love the Escape games, and this is one of the better ones.  The quality of the graphics is good, and it was hard enough to be interesting but not so hard that you'd get frustrated and give up.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I think this book was really fascinating, I like how she was stubborn and how she started to fall in love with Dean and how she could smile after what happened to her.<br /><br /> I think that this book deserves this rating because of the way it is plotted.
B00BQ1D7BQ|5.0|This is one of the better new CD's I have gotten in a long time, of course look at the lineup of musicians, all outstanding
B008469DGY|4.0|Fun little game but if it was a.whole course with putting it would have been great! Please make a full golf game.
B0012HF5NC|5.0|Loved it the first time I saw it and every time after that.  Kick butt movie. Lots of fun to see.
B003TNW044|5.0|I love this show! It never gets old! I will watch and re-watch these DVDs until they are worn out. That's pretty much it!
B003K15IF8|4.0|Very well written and told. A story of so many lost opportunities, but very engagung at the same time. The life of a small college prof, though still so much academic politics that he just was not up to.
B00EQUP3Q6|2.0|This is such a Meh album.<br /><br />Now I don't really have any problem with him doing an electronic-esque album, or whatever this thing is supposed to be, but this project doesn't really bring that much to the table. Its way too minimalist to even really keep my attention. Its just plodding and lacking substance. Its really hard to write a review for album, because there's not much to really say. Its just bleeps and bloops, almost like the direction Radiohead went in.<br /><br />I don't find really anything on this album to be impressive or inspired. It sounds like something I could crap out on my laptop, (which is NOT a good sign whatsoever). Now take something like Pretty Hate Machine. I am fascinated to this day with the arrangements Reznor came up with. With Hesitation Marks, nothing stands out as memorable, no emotional high points, it just plods along in a very boring manner.<br /><br />But the blandness of this album doesn't really surprise me. NIN really started going generic with Year Zero. I could argue With Teeth, but I kind of like that album, when in the right mood. Year Zero is just noise, and The Slip was a phoned-in freebie album and finally Hesitation Marks just screams \\"hey look, I'm a oscar winning provocative artist, look what I made\\", but sadly Hesitation Marks just does not deliver.<br /><br />For me, Pretty Hate machine, Hurt, Downward spiral and The Fragile are what Trent Reznor gave to the world. When I listen to those albums, my heart raises and I get goosebumps. Never once did I have any type of emotional response while listening to Hesitation Marks.<br /><br />So bottom line is, if you are a NIN fan, you probably won't like this album. If you aren't a NIN fan and were looking to get into them, stay far away from this album. and if you are a brown nosing Trent Reznor apologist, make sure to buy at least 10 copies.
B008Y7N7JW|1.0|I suppose my problem is that this is \\"young adult\\" fiction...didn't realize that when I picked up the book. Probably most young people nowadays would enjoy it. Certainly is nowhere near even \\"soft\\" science fiction; just a conglomeration of all the sf tropes found in post-apocalyptic dystopian stories, and I found it boring. But that's just me.
B008469DGY|4.0|I'm not a golfer and that doesn't matter at all.  This can entertain me as long or as briefly as I wish.
B008602KQI|4.0|I thought this was a great movie.  The casting was very good.  I just wish it could've contained more of the detail from the book...but then it would've been a much longer movie.  I would highly recommend BOTH the book AND the movie.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|I've been playing this version on UNO for weeks now and loved it, EXCEPT.  I cannot find any way within the app, nor online or at facebook to be able to change things in my \\"account\\", like adding picture, reviewing and adding friends.  NOW, for a couple of days, I didn't even manage to get connected to be able to play games against other \\"live\\" players, however, when I went to Gameloft's website I did find that they were aware of and working on the problem.  Now, everything is up and running and is just fine~!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Not one boring chapter. Kept me guessing as I couldn't turn the pages fast enough. Loved how it was written from both a male and female perspective. Very clever.
B001NFU5WE|5.0|After Batman Begins re-awoke the series after the campy films Joel Schumacher put out in the late 90s, this masterpiece was released.<br /><br />This film brings back the serious side of the dark knight that the first two films captured perfectly.<br /><br />Christian Bale does an oscar worthy job as Bruce Wayne, on par with Michael Keaton's perfect performance.<br /><br />Not to be missed.
B00004W50Z|5.0|Great CD, I always buy from Amazon.com for all of my movie and music purchases. They have the best sellers and everything always comes to me in great time and perfect condition, even if I had purchased a used one.  Thanks Amazon, for everything you have to offer  your customers.
B0013N7AD8|5.0|The first two films in the set are the Tim Burton directed Batman films & capture perfectly Gotham City & it's inhabitants right out of the comics.  Batman & Batman Returns are such masterpieces that they outweigh the other two films in this set which were more camp than film to such an extent that I still gave the box set 5 stars.<br /><br />The second two films directed by Joel Schumacher can be pretty funny if you don't take them seriously.  Great camp, but nowhere near the tour de force of the first two films.<br /><br />The fact that I'm giving it 5 stars is a testament to just how good the first two films are.
B00011KHTM|5.0|I don't know why I never thought of it, but having the second monitor increased my productivity.  This is plug and play, easy to use.
B0017HRCQU|5.0|Batman Begins is a re-awakening of the series after the campy films Joel Schumacher put out in the late 90s.<br /><br />This film brings back the serious side of the dark knight that the first two films captured perfectly.<br /><br />Christian Bale does an oscar worthy job as Bruce Wayne, on par with Michael Keaton's perfect performance.<br /><br />Not to be missed.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|After purchasing this, I realized how limited its functions are.  I was probably better of buying Apple TV or something else.
1936608898|5.0|I have read this book over and over and affectionately refer to it as my \\"bible.\\" It Starts with Food covers a seemingly simple topic and simple proposition. We should eat foods that make us healthier, and stay away from those that don't. However, just because something is simple does not necessarily mean it is easy!<br /><br />It Starts with Food outlines the principals of the Whole30 program and goes into great details in regards to the how's and the why's in a way that is factual, not emotional or evangelical. My first Whole30 was a year ago, but it the principals are ones that I keep going back to as I always feel optimal when I stick to them. To say it will change your life might be cliche, but if (and only if) you adhere to the Hartwig's recommendations you will see your life change in unexpected ways. Like, seriously.
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|I really wanted to like this book more than I did.  I loved the concept of the old pictures playing a part of the story, and the story's plot was good.  I found myself getting a little bored in parts where I shouldn't have been, and it took about 100 pages for it to really keep my interest.  The setting and the idea of the time loop were wonderful, I just kept waiting for it to get scarier or creepier than it was.  I felt like, at times, there was almost a stretch to reach the next photograph.
B006S01GH2|5.0|This movie touched a lot of emotions and was a dose of reality.<br />I am glad to see the ending it had.
B005FRF6PC|4.0|An honest and insightful account of a great athlete. Many a young athlete would derive a profit by reading and applying the lessons contained in it.
1451696191|5.0|I enjoyed this story of the young man and his friends, and I am passing the book on to my high school age acquaintances.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|I have loved this series since I streamed the first series on my computer.  Can't wait until Series 4 comes out in January.<br /><br />This is great viewing for anyone who enjoys seeing how life evolved from estste living to a more modern life style.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|This book was pretty good. I read the first Ender's Game book and got hooked. It was a little long, and the ending was strange, but the book as a whole was good and I'm glad I read it.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|I love this game it all fun but the hardest thing is gettin gold for the team's and charms also the multiplayer mode is also easy to play
B008Y7D4FY|5.0|I always enjoy movies that are scary as opposed to gorey, and this one fits the bill. Can't wait for the sequel!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Loved this game, the graphics are fantastic. The game was very intriguing and fascinating. My only complaint is I wish it was longer, and I don't want that statement to deter anyone from purchasing this app. It is well worth the $. Truth is its not the longest game in the world( it took me about a week or so playing daily on average about 2 hour's) but it was very enjoyable while it lasted. The clues were just easy enough to not be to complicated where you get stuck to often and loose interest which is good.  It said they were going to be releasing &quot;The Room 2&quot;, late 2013.... To the creators:I AM ANXIOUSLY WAITING! It's late 2013, let's have it... Haha. Can't wait for the second one to come out, and I hope that it's game #2 , of many more to come(and more frequently and if possible LONGER (more chapters) please. ;)
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|I love Suits, all of the seasons, but season two in particular. By season two you get to know each of the characters and love them-or hate them- even more. There's just enough suspense and drama. I would highly recommend. And Amazon instant video quality is fantastic.
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|I really enjoyed playing this game!! I have been looking for a new mahjong app for a while. The graphics are nice and the backgrounds are beautiful. Thank you for this app. I finally got the app I really love!!!<br />I glad their is so many figures in this game. I do like the shuffle button, I wish their was more tiles to choose from.
B00640UICA|4.0|fun game fun not for kids yougner than 4-5 probably. My 3 year old just can watch me play. Great graphics
B00ECU34ZM|2.0|Starts strong and then goes off the cliff...  How many of the Techs were they watching?  They can capture drones, but they cannot defend against them? tech maintaines Drones, but ship cannot supply spare parts?  what?  CLONES?  really???
B0018J2QB8|5.0|Season 2 was definitely NOT a disappointment. Now...on to season 3. Since I never got to see Dexter as it was showing, it is really fun to be able to sit down and watch as many episodes as I want at a time. I recommend watching all series this way!
B005OYKHSM|3.0|Plot is really weak and clumsy.  Delving into family was good, but .... The childhood friend comes in and out at odd times.  How did they even get to that location?  The racing scenes were cut short. Mia is pregnant, but jumps through a roof and keeps going with no adverse affects to the baby?  Just disappointing....
B00AFEXRME|1.0|I won't watch any thing with nudity and sexual incidents in it, but you can't get past the first 5 minutes without both in this film it made a fast exit into our burn barrel.
B002PMPTIO|4.0|Great action and younger forms of the originals is great as well.  Why was Spock living in a cave and not at the outpost?  Kid Kirk was a little over the top.  The rest was pretty great entertainment.
B004OC07F8|3.0|Good reading not a lot if new information.  It provides good examples and historical bacground, but no much new insight in the creation on new blue oceans.
B00499K9E0|5.0|Never really bothered to read any of Sir Conan Doyle's books and wasn't a fan of any previous adaptations until this one.  If you haven't watched this series, you don't know what your missing.
B001KT6JPA|1.0|I felt like I was watching a B movie.  Julianne Moore was a terrible replacement for Jodie Foster, and it just felt like the entire time they were just trying to show you something else to gross you out instead of creating a better story.
B00CY0JY88|4.0|I loved this series and was disappointed when i finished it.Im so pleased to hear there are going to be more books in the series.
B00ESY7QXI|2.0|it was not what I expected.  I did not like the movie.  I wish I could get my money back.
B005HED11Y|5.0|Although not in wide screen format the remastered episodes are very good quality.  Watching a fight scene with kirk (on a 23\\" screen) it was totally obvious that there was a stunt double in his place.  Something I never noticed on a 25\\" tube TV.  As a prime member you can stream all episodes for free so I will watch all the good episodes.
1451695195|5.0|After reading this book of course I had some questions...  and there is some negative feedback of course from other sources.  However, after reading the feedback in detail, I felt Dr. Alexander's critics were stretching hard to find ways to criticize him.  I went back to the question:  why would a successful medical professional with Dr. Alexander's credentials risk his reputation to write a book about NDE?  I couldn't come up with a satisfactory answer.  I am a long-time believer in NDE's and after death communication, as I have had several after death communications - with a family dog and my father.  I see no reason not to believe - and believing that we have the ability to return actually makes more sense to me than any other explanation.  Inspiring read.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|I thought this was a great sci-fi movie. The graphics were awesome, and the storyline was great. Acting was very decent also. One small beef I had with it was I found it a little slow at places, but that could really have been down to the minimal amount of characters and the emptiness of the stes - not a big issue at all, but the only reason it's getting 4 not 5 starts. Well worth a watch.
B00EY8A6BC|2.0|The entire movie could be cool based on the premise, but every plot point is a stretch to believe.  you would need about 5 hrs to make it make sense.  disappointing
B0014NDXGA|5.0|I purchased this rangefinder back in June and it has exceeded my expectations. This Bushnell rangefinder not only is easy to use, but very accurate. The best part is my golf game has improved by being able to make a more exact club selection. Thanks Busnell! Highly recommend![[ASIN:B00BLR484K BUSHNELL 201930 TOUR V2 LASER RANGEFINDER PINSEEKER]]
B000FCKIFU|5.0|i had only read baldacci's book The Winner prior to this and I just love this Camel Club series.  the characters are fun and well developed as well which is often rare in books of this genre.  Oliver Stone is a fun protagonist and his buddies are hillarious.  I raced through the whole series of Camel Club books in a a couple of weeks since I got so hooked.
B008HK3XKO|1.0|The information on fitting the kindle Fire that I own did not fit. It is too big by 1/4 inch which caused the kindle to slide, fall out.
B000UZNRS2|3.0|i love the characters of the camel club and the concept.  while this book is a good fast paced read, it seemed more like a lee childs reacher book than a camel club book.

B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love this Bingo game.  Keeps me entertained for hours.  I recommended to my eldery mother who loves Bingo but is no longer able to drive.
B00AYB1RGG|5.0|Seamy Blade-Runner-type vision of the future, not the bizarre caricature that Stallone had to work with. Karl Urban not to over-the-top with the smirk behind the mask...Olivia Thulrby (sp?) was a breath of fresh air visually and in her role.
B0085LMFAE|5.0|I always loved Graceland by Paul Simon since it first came out. But I had it on cassette and years ago no longer used cds and forgot about it until recently. Love it again! Great mixture of American and African sounds.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Love it it's the best game ever it was free it should be like $299 I recommend this game you can be the reef shark mako shark hammer head shark tigger shark great white shark last but not least a megalidon
B0031Q0XCA|3.0|The dance scene with the bluebird on Joseph Gordon-Levitt's shoulder Totally stands out...it could be a great movie made in the style :)  (Does JGL dance?) The whole rest of the movie I kept waiting for them to break out in song and dance. And smile!<br /><br />Unfortunately, This is a movie about a man obsessed with a certain woman who does not feel the same and how he cannot bring himself to accept this fact.  Though she will be friends with benefits he wants more. He also can't accept the fact that she does what she wants to, instead of molding to society's standards of how women should act.<br /><br />Boring...maybe too much like real life.  I had to surf the internet to stay entertained while watching this movie it was such a bore--but I almost Always give movies a chance.  I love both main actors, but they did not click or fit the roles in this movies.  I think the main problem was each one is so strong on their own that when you try to put them together, neither one shines.  (Gorden-Levitt and Deschanel)  I love JGL but he should not play sad boring roles like this. Same with Deschanel.<br /><br />Also, it begins and ends with a narrator who appears sporadically throughout and not often enough to make the movie flow.  It ended rather sudden and left me wondering what the point was. 3 stars really for the actors.
0062082353|5.0|Chris Kyle is a true American hero...spoken from a Viet Nam sniper USMC. I love what our snipers have available to them in this day

B00280LYIC|4.0|This book was a delight.  I am in my mid 30's but wanted a light reading while on bed rest.<br />It was a fun book full of adventure and imagination.<br />I truly enjoyed reading it and plan to read the rest of the series.
B008SAZHLQ|4.0|This book will make all your emotions surface. I laughed I cried. But, in the end it really made you feel better as a person. This is a great read for anyone I highly recommend it!
B00C6B9H46|5.0|I love this movie, the breakout role for Vin Diesel and a classic sci-fi monster movie IMHO.  Already bought this several times but the steelbook with comic art got me again.  LOVE some steelbook blu-rays.
B004PUG7MG|5.0|I've always loved Avril, and this album reminded me why. It's a bit different than what she's done it the past, but it's just as good!
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|This second installment of the Star Trek franchise reboot is phenomenal.  The acting is perfect, the dialogue witty and poignant (and sometimes just the right amount of cheesy), and the whole film is just plain fun, from start to finish.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B00DAXXO98|5.0|Simply stunning program that combines both brilliant acting (truly spectacular performances by Spacey, Wright, et al) with brilliant writing.  This show is not to be missed.  A new classic!
B009LA1QW6|4.0|The album is amazing, what i didn't like was that they sent me the wrong one. There's two versions to Paradise and I got the wrong one.
B00ABLJ5NQ|4.0|Enchanting, quirky and menacing in the right doses in the right places. I was quickly drawn into the story and comfortably bourne along as the plot unfolded.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Brilliant. So easy to use and brilliant results. Easily the best you tube downloader for android.Will definitey reccomend to others
B008NBEXZQ|5.0|i LOVE this french release from Celine. it features some great tracks plus Ne Me Quitte Pas from her new Celine show in Vegas. I love this album.
B00AECGQF2|1.0|I wish I knew what people meant by being able to shampoo and color the hair. The only things available to me (my grandson) is a comb, scissors, clippers and a razor. Also, no way to 'take a pictures of his end creations. Very disappointed in this app.
B00190OHD6|5.0|This is a really good movie and is perfect for a romantic evening.  It makes one laugh and cry, sometimes at the same time.  I would highly recommend it.<br /><br />Annie H.
0385536828|2.0|Almost put this one down 100 times in discuss.  I have to use 20 words so all I can say is the cover of the book I liked her raincoat.
B008469DGY|4.0|This is NOT a full course game. This is basically a driving range or hole-in-one game. Despite that, this game is loads of fun. You can control the ball in the air, which is a nice twist on a lot of other golf games. The tournaments are challenging.<br /><br />The only reason I gave it four instead of five stars is once you beat all the course, that's it. You're done. No more courses.
140006922X|5.0|I was astounded by so many misconceptions I had regarding the time line of when Jesus roamed the earth.  It is a must for education for all.

159463176X|5.0|The characters in this book were so compelling I wanted to know more than what was given of them.  He should have written three long novels instead of one.  Hosseini is a master of literature.  Get back at that computer and get going.  I can't wait for the next Hosseini novel.  You owe it to the world to enlighten it as you have been give the gift.
B005WUHAX8|3.0|It was a bit difficult to snap this on my device but it does work!  No water leakage.  When under water, I had a hard time taking pictures.  Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't.
1451629184|1.0|This was one of the worst books I have ever attempted to read.  I usually finish books no matter what but couldn't do it with this one.  Very bad in all ways.  Don't waste your money.
B0012909NQ|5.0|Loved this concert so much, bought the DVD. Will be playing it again and again. It's the only concert DVD I own.
B006SV2LWA|4.0|Good movie. Makes you think how quickly a virus can get out of hand. I like how they showed at the end how the virus began. I was wrong...
B001NB6IN8|5.0|Folie a Deux is Fall Out Boy's least popular album. HOWEVER, it is also my favorite from Fall Out Boy and #2 on my all time favorites from any band or artist.<br />This record was very closely involved with Patrick Stump, the singer/guitarist of the band. I hate calling some people better than others, but I think he is extremely talented.<br />&#34;Disloyal Order of Water Buffaloes&#34; starts the album off with a catchy, memorable chorus that makes me want to sing at the top of my lungs.<br />&#34;I Don't Care&#34; is like a little rebel song, as suggested by the title. With its blues guitar riff and a nice beat to clap along to, this song was the most popular song off the album, and I can really see why.<br />&#34;She's My Winoa&#34; is a sort of fast-drummed out song. It sort of carries a lot of the vibe that this record holds as a whole, and that vibe is really... different. That's probably why the album didn't really take off. However, I really like how Patrick tried out a completely different vibe than the public was used to.<br />&#34;America's Suitehearts&#34; is my favorite off this record. I don't know why, but I'd describe this song as the kind of song that wants to make a statement. It's about how the media can take what makes you YOU and throw it out of the window and destroy you.<br />In &#34;Headfirst Slide Into Cooperstown,&#34; Patrick gets to show off how deep his voice is. It has a sort of hard-rock-ish verse  and chorus. The part after the chorus (or is that the chorus and the part before it is the pre-chorus?) softens, with a piano playing the chords. Great song.<br />&#34;The (Shipped) Gold Standard&#34; is absolutely wonderful, in my opinion. I wish i could just say that for all of the songs and it would make sense, but sadly, I cannot. The message of the song is pretty clear in the chorus. &#34;You can only blame your problems on the world for so long/before it all becomes the same old song&#34;<br />&#34;(Coffee's For Closers)&#34;... can Ionce again say that this is one of my favorites? It has a really good beat to it. It's another one of those songs that makes you want to sing at the rest of the world as loudly as you can. &#34;I will never believe in anything again/I will never believe in anything again!/Oh change will come, oh/change will come/I will never believe in anything again!&#34;<br />&#34;What A Catch, Donnie&#34; is that one song off the album that makes you just cry your feels out. It's a piano song with recognizable lyrics - &#34;I've got troubled thoughts and the self esteem to match/what a catch&#34; - and... should I just explain my initial reaction to this song? When I first listened to it, my first thought was, &#34;well, I bet I'm going to be crying my eyes out by the end of this.&#34; The key changed for the chorus and I got goosebumps all over. I started freaking out a little bit at the sheer awesomeness of it. After the second chorus, I was reeling a little bit by the overwhelming amount of feelings. Then it referenced back to &#34;Headfirst Slide...&#34; and I mouthed the lyrics along in awe. Then the chorus came again and I felt my eyes wet. The ending of the song references back to all of Fall Out Boy's hit songs, and I was freaking out because I knew all of them. I couldn't stop the goosebumps (which were extremely strong now) and i think one or two tears came.<br />I was sitting in the back of my car and my parents didn't notice.<br />&#34;27&#34; is kind of different than the rest. It was one of my favorites the first time I heard the album. It's sort of a little bit dance-y. The guitar part is very repetitious, but it is also very catchy.<br />&#34;Tiffany Blews&#34; has one of my favorite Fall Out Boy lines starting it out. &#34;I'm not a crybaby/I'm THE crybaby.&#34; This song makes me forget how unpopular this record is. I'm really not sure how I like it so much, but the beat is sort of jazzy, so that might be a part of it.<br />&#34;W.A.M.S&#34; stands for &#34;Waiter Actor Model Singer.&#34; Pete Wentz, the bass player and lyrics writer of the band, came up with the title, so he's probably one of the only people on Earth that knows what that means. It sounds completely different from the rest of the album, sounding a lot more rock-ish with a much more distinctive guitar/bass line. Ooh, I love it so much.<br />&#34;20 Dollar Nose Bleed&#34; is a FOB fan favorite. Patrick Stump recorded the vocals with Brendon Urie from Panic! At The Disco. However, it's pretty hard to tell for someone who doesn't listen to those two bands as much as I do, since their voices are very similar. It's a very bright and happy song and it makes me want to dance. It's also very fun to sing to :)<br />&#34;West Coast Smoker&#34; is another one of the songs on the album that sounds rock-ish. Debby Harry is featured in this song. It's sort of sounds like a moshing song to me.<br />Wow I'm almost done.<br />Overall: FANTASTIC ALBUM!
B008JFUO36|3.0|This movie was flashy with futuristic effects but I expected more &#34;meat&#34; to the story line. I expected more from a Tom Cruise movie
B000059TFO|5.0|Another of Gene Hackman's great movies, and a raw and for real look into Civil Rights struggles of the 1960's. I am a 'Boomer' who lived through this era, and this is one of my Go To movies about these issues and turmoils of the time. This movie personifies the struggles and lawlessness of sections the South during this era of Civil Rights. Many may argue or be indignant about these times, but numerous News reel footage tells the tale, even if some may deny or tend to downplay what happened in our Country at this time in the late 1950's and in the 1960's.
B005LAII8A|5.0|Just what I expected from Bruce Willis and Joseph. What a superb concept and writing, not to mention first class acting. I wasn't expecting the ending! Wow.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book has become something of an eBook phenomenon. Author Huge Howey self published the first story via Kindle Direct Publishing a couple years ago with no fanfare and charging next to nothing for it. People simply found it and began reading it. And telling their friends about it, who told their friends, who told their friends... That first story then became 5 collected here as the Wool Omnibus.<br /><br />This has to be one of the best works of original science fiction I have ever read. The concept of a post apocalyptic world is certainly not new but Howey's setting takes it to a completely new level. Once I started it I could hardly put it down. And reading it was like peeling layers of an onion... New revelations with every chapter with plenty of \\"ah-ha\\" moments. This story had a way of grabbing me by the gut in the same way as The Matrix movie.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to any lover of good science fiction. The Omnibus still doesn't cost much on Kindle. Howey has also written a pre-quel series now collected in the Shift Omnibus and the final book Dust, was just released.  Also, WOOL is part of Kindle Worlds on Amazon and there is plenty of amazing fan fiction already available.

B00DGMVJAO|4.0|Always looking for family entertainment. My husband and I being of the older generation like clean movies but something with a<br />plot. This was a little different spin on Jack and The Beanstalk so we found it entertaining and fun :) It was fun to hear the voice of<br />the actor that played Davey Jones from Pirates of Caribbean movies coming out of the two headed giant. It made us laugh!

B00DYCBH4O|5.0|I read Jane Astin at least once a year. To have the novel illistrated added another joy to the process.
B00AYB1RGG|1.0|Makes the original look like an Oscar winner, and that it certainly was not.  Special effects do not take the place of acting.
0064409422|5.0|A book that can be enjoyed by all ages.  It has many profound messages, that can  be understood by all ages.

B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I will say that the beginning was what was drawing me in, but then as I got further into the book, I became disappointed in how I could tell she was stretching it out. It shouldn't become a trilogy, but a saga instead because now there'll be four to five books not just three. Don't waste your money. /:

B0034G4OYA|5.0|Wonderful storyline and great animation!  I would recommend this movie to anyone, kids and adults included.  The DVD quality was good, as well.
B000FBJHT4|4.0|Wow!  What an amazing citation of facts, figures, dates, and names to absolutely, without a doubt, support the contention that UFOs have been in our airspace and in some instances, crash landing, on our planet  for years.  Col. Cosmo knows what he's talking about.  As a former member of President Eisenhower's National Security Council and former head of the Foreign Technology Desk at the U.S. Army's Research & Development department,  the author tells what really went on behind the scenes- how UFO programs were disguised as other things, how artifacts from the 1947 Roswell crash were crucial in our development of lasar, Kevlar, missile systems, night vision, etc,  and how the huge UPO secrets were kept from the American people for so many years.  The politics involved were intriguing, from the suspicions and infighting of the various service branches, the infiltration of the CIA, and the &#34;sale&#34; to Americans to protect ourselves from the Russians when, in fact, we were linked arm in arm with them to protect the planet and our space programs from aliens.<br /><br />It does make you wonder what other secrets we have...
B008N1V11U|5.0|The ease of use on the tablet brings me back to this game nightly.  I am a big Batman fan and when I saw i could buy this with my Amazon coins I just had to get it.  It did not disappoint.  There were a few glicthes at first, but going through it again the second time the glicthes have dissapeared.  I would like to see Batman use the bat pod and bat more so you can practice on them and master those skills.  Love the gliding part of the game.
0143124544|5.0|when you read the back of the book,<br />it seems like an ordinary love story and you pretty much know how it is going to end.<br />BUT it is so well written, I laughed and I cried and will never forget this book.<br />it is one of those books you do not want to finish it because it is so good.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Easy to use.  All you need to know about the weather can be easily accessed.  Easy to swipe from screen to screen.
6304498969|5.0|Rolling Stone says today that a two disk, expanded and remastered version of this great disk and the MTV show will be released this fall. It is said to include \\"never before seen rehearsal footage\\" as well. Certainly something to look forward to, this recording is and has been a classic and one of the best of the MTV Unplugged series.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|No doubt one of the best in years. Great cast ( anything with Judi Dench  - is usually good). Not for your Rambo or Bruce Willis set, but for anyone with a brain, it is terrific.
B00ANDPGJE|5.0|This series nearly had me fooled with its slow start and initially confusing array of characters. I was really tempted to move on to something else after the initial episode. I am very glad I didn't as it quickly got down to business and I was soon watching multiple episodes per evening. I was completely blindsided by the outcome of the final episode in the first of the trilogy series, itself called House of Cards. The main character, whose initials are appropriately FU, is one you would hope to never find in politics. But, throughout the episodes you really stop to wonder whether many of his characteristics might actually be commonplace. My only complaint about the trilogy, which I purchased in Blu-ray, is that it is a mediocre Blu-ray transfer at best. Do no expect razor sharp images. It is soft, grainy and at 1:33x1, definitely not widescreen. That is a shame, as it takes place in some historic locations within London, and at several country homes, including Checquers. It would have benefited tremendously from  a true remastering, if this is in fact a remaster I would certainly not want to see the original DVD presentation. I have seen DVD's with better video than this supposed remastered Blu-ray.
B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|This game is a lot of fun but also a challenge. Just don't start playing if you have other things you need to be doing because it's hard to walk away once you start.

0064471837|5.0|As an avid reader of young adult fantasy, I find myself coming back to this book time and time again. It has everything I look for in a fantasy story: compelling and well-developed characters, exciting action and events, original world-building and ideas, and especially the beautiful reflections on the nature of death.<br /><br />I was first introduced to the series by Tim Curry's wonderful audio version, which on it's own one of the finest audiobooks I've experienced, and have since purchased the three books multiple times after wearing them out and passing them on to friends (I think it's time to upgrade to a hardcover edition for my permanent library).<br /><br />I truly can't recommend this book and its sequels enough.

B00CI5MYUY|5.0|This 2 CD plus DVD box set from shows in Tokyo on December 16 and 17 1996 is a jewel (and includes 3 filler songs that were recorded in studio - tracks 9, 10 and 11 on disc 2 - with a different lineup). The selection is diverse (lots of solo Hackett, some Genesis, some King Crimson, some solo Wetton, and a Dylan classic), and both the sound quality and performances are very good (clunkier and not as vibrant as the originals perhaps, but clean and polished nonetheless). John Wetton is no Gabriel for vocals, but his style fits in well with this material (as does his bass sound). The rest of the line up is (a solid but mostly unremarkable) Chester Thompson on drums, Ian McDonald on flute, sax, guitar, keys and vocals (delightful and a rare treat, especially for the KC songs) and Julian Colbeck on keys and vocals. Steve Hackett obviously loves returning to his roots and was probably pretty happy with this band, even if he often sounds the most lively of the group (other than McDonald). The DVD shows the same set of songs, and pretty much shows a well filmed no nonsense concert, with plenty of opportunity to see Hackett's consummate technique, - what a great bonus!<br /><br />This concert was the outgrowth of the first [[ASIN:B000086EOE Genesis Revisited]] sessions which had been recorded earlier in '96, and some of the interplay between these same accomplished musicians is extraordinary (\\"Court of the Crimson King\\"). It has a lot of cover tunes done as straight covers, but there is also enough reworking and improv to make it interesting (\\"Firth of Fifth\\", \\"Black Light\\"). Perhaps though, my favorite is just hearing the solo guitar on \\"Horizons\\", so gentle, so nostalgic! I'd have to say the main reason I got this set is because of the King Crimson material (and Ian McDonald), and those are surly worth it, but the rest of the material is good to excellent as well (of the extra studio material, while ok both \\"Firewall\\" and \\"The Dealer\\" would have benefited from real drumming, but \\"All Along the Watchtower\\" apparently recorded in 2013, is great - shred it Steve!). What is not to love about Hackett bringing his distinctive, lilting, sinuous guitar to any song!<br /><br />This is all great music and musicianship, but I want to add, I think it's remarkable that, if anything, Hackett has just gotten better in the 15+ years since this show, recording everything from serious classical guitar albums, to a second set of (even better) Genesis covers (2012), as well as some of the best material he's ever recorded in studio [[ASIN:B005H1SDQU Beyond the Shrouded Horizon]] (2011) and live [[ASIN:B004TF3HZ2 Live Rails]] (2009/2010). These Tokyo Tapes get a 4+ stars for an overall very nicely produced set.g, but \\"All Along the Watchtower\\" apparently recorded in 2013, is great - shred it Steve!).

B000AMPZF8|5.0|While it is one of my favourite albums of all time, I have a difficult time choosing which is my favourite Muse album. This is a great choice however. One of Muse's best. Also one of his earlier albums. There has been nothing like this album when it came out or ever since. A real unique listen. Bellamy's voice is also as sublime as it is unique. I get a great feeling form listening to this album that I don't get with any other band. The cover art is great too. I bought this as a gift for someone, I think it's great. Consider gifting this to one of the Muse fans in your life.

0374214913|5.0|With hundreds of rave reviews, you really don't need another rave from me to push you over the edge on this remarkably rewarding book.<br /><br />But, here's one additional thought. I've read a number of books, mainstream and indie, that have started strong and then sort of petered out in the middle and then just limped home to a weak and unsatisfactory finish. To the contrary here, this book picks up steam, focus, and narrative drive and then ends with a strong and convincing flourish.<br /><br />What a fine example of the best in modern literary fiction.

0792846303|4.0|This is an old time scare show from beginning to end;never mind what some critics said.Good special effects and soundtrack to boot.You know back in 1956 there was an episode on the tv drama Climax! that was titled \\"The Fog\\".In that episode a small town is held in the grip of a mysterious and poisonous fog vapor.Wonder if a videotape or kinescope of that episode still exists or is stashed away in some network vault somewhere.
B00D8HNR2K|4.0|I got into Nine Inch Nails in spring of 2012, when I bought The Downward Spiral, which quickly became one of my favorite albums ever (the only ones which rival it are AEnima and the Wall). I downloaded everything else in Reznor's catalogue and fell in love with all of the albums, each having a profoundly different feel from any of the other albums, each one realizing a different side of him, and showing a clear evolutionary pattern. I couldn't wait for another release, the next step in his career and art. Unfortunately, that was about the time NIN disappeared for a while, while Trent worked on other projects. But this spring, when the new album, new single, and new tour were announced, I was beyond overjoyed. I loved the song, I bought my ticket to the Spokane show the second it was posted for presale, and I counted down the days until Hesitation Marks came out, and bought it at Best Buy the same day.<br /><br />  After four listens so far, I am very impressed. It has a clear sound, differing from all other NIN releases, but also sounds very distinctly like a NIN release. It's clear that he is not the same person that he was when he recorded classics like The Downward Spiral, and The Fragile, as he now has a family and has kicked his drug habits. It's a very toned down album, and very electronic, kind of reminiscent of The Fragile and Year Zero, but much softer than either of them. I will not give a reason for not giving this album five stars, there are very few albums which I believe deserve a perfect score, and while this is a very good album, it is not quite as good as TDSotM, Led Zeppelin IV, or by NIN himself, The Downward Spiral. So without any further ado, let the review commence.<br /><br />1. The Eater of Dreams - A nice instrumental intro to the album, which gives a preview of the rest of the album, showcasing the interesting, high electronic patterns, and low, bass heavy drives.<br /><br />2. Copy of A - The second single of this album, and a very solid song, with a very catchy chorus. The soundscaoe of this song was well crafted, especially in the drums section. My only complaint is the clear \\"copy\\" of his former friend's, Marilyn Manson's song \\"Target Audience (Narcissus Narcosis).\\" \\"I'm just a copy of a copy of a copy of a...\\" sings Reznor, which is almost quoting Manson's \\"You're just a copy of an imitation.\\" This could be an oversight though, and won't hold it too hard against him.<br /><br />3. Came Back Haunted - Th first single of the album, released the day the album was announced. This song is pretty typical for a NIN song, featuring use of synth sequences, a guitar driven shouting chorus, and dark angsty lyrics. But despite all of this, these are the things we have come to love in Reznor and his work, and it worked very well as a teaser to the album.<br /><br />4. Find My Way - A very soft song, with electronic drums, and light piano harmonies. It could have come straight off The Fragile, and is also reminiscent of \\"Right Where it Belongs\\" from With Teeth. This song was performed live before the album was released, but not until the release did the studio release become available.<br /><br />5. All Time Low - Just when you thought you had this album figured this song plays and you realize that Reznor really is going to completely new areas on this album. This song has a clear rock-funk groove, almost similar to Red Hot Chili Peppers, and is one of the best songs on the album.<br /><br />6. Disappointed - Another song which was played live but not officially released until the album. This song features quite a lot of the noise that dominated The Downward Spiral, but not as aggressive.<br /><br />7. Everything - This is easily the happiest song ever recorded by NIN. In fact, the only other remotely positive song I can think of is \\"We;re in this Together,\\" and this is far more upbeat. It sounds a lot like a post punk tune from The Cure or Billy Idol.<br /><br />8. Satellite - This was the first song he recorded, at first intended for a new song to be featured on a greatest hits compilation. It's a very sexy, danceable song, and the beat is interesting, even by NIN standards.<br /><br />9.  Various Methods of Escape - One of my favorites on the album, this song features all of the best things about this album: driving processed guitars, delicate falsetto vocals, complex drum beats, and catchy choruses.<br /><br />10. Running - The title gives an idea of the beat of the song, which is very fast paced. The whole song is balanced balanced perfectly, with the subtle tones<br /><br />11. I Would For You - One of the most intense songs of the album, even during the laid-back verses, there are some awesome aggressive industrial sounds.<br /><br />12. In Two - This song is just awesome. This song sounds very much like him in his glory days. The chorus is one of my favorite parts of the whole album. It's one of the high points in his whole career.<br /><br />13. While I'm Still Here - A great closing song to the album, in combination to the final instrumental piece. A lot like \\"Find My Way,\\" in style and structure, and has a nice bassline in the chorus.<br /><br />14. Black Noise - \\"While I'm Still Here\\" fades into this piece of distorted guitar and noise source, to close the album in similar fashion to The Downward Spiral<br /><br />  I bought the deluxe edition, which features excellent remixes of \\"Find My Way,\\" \\"All Time Low,\\" and \\"While I'm Still Here,\\" but the main attraction of the deluxe version to me was the book layout of the case, the lyrics lie in actually pages of the album-sized book which is the packaging. It comes with great artwork as well.<br /><br />  To sum up this album, while this is not NIN's greatest work (*coughdownwardspiralcough*) everything he has released has been head and shoulders above nearly every other album coming out in recent memory, and this album is no exception. Every song is solid and has something unique to offer, and maintains the flow that marks this album. It has a very surreal, yet unsettling aura to it, and takes a couple of listens to fully grasp. So far this album has been doing very commercially well, and the critics are rating it very highly, and I couldn't be happier. It's about time some good music became popular again, when we are constantly affronted by atrocities by the names of Nikki Minaj, Katy Perry, Ke$ha and company. Nine inch Nails has given the the breath of fresh air I desperately needed in a dark, dark world where inspired music in the mainstream is more than scarce.
B0050OMJIW|5.0|A book that is horrific, hilarious, relevant, sinister, entertaining, cynical, fantastic and clever. It usually is doing several of these things at any one time. Still a thought provoking read - so glad it appeared on my kindle reading list via The Australian.
B001QFZADA|3.0|I preferred his first novel although this book did provide a very enlightening guide to sympathetic listening that was not in the first edition.  The rest of the book basically mirrored the Married Couples edition, and I felt that original version better resonated, as I've been in several serious relationships.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the author's tendency to delve more into religion and 'god's' role in a relationship was a bit of a turnoff.  But you can easily skip over those parts and still glean some helpful information from this book.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|First, I just have to say a technical word. Most of the good reviews of this film rave about the \\"3D\\" version, and frankly this makes me a little sick. Beautifully photographed, yes, but you don't need to see it in 3D, a passing fancy, to be impressed by the incedible visual impact of this film. It is a Lee masterpiece, and you can hear Louis Armstrong on an old 33/rd pressing of the song \\"It's a wonderful world\\", and be just as impressed, in fact more so, than hearing it on a modern CD. So let's let the technocrats go here! Those glasses stink.<br /><br />Second, this is clearly a \\"fable\\", in its most wonderous sort. The second story Pi tells to the Japanese insurance agents is the True Story, while the movie shows us the Fable. Now, the fable is not a figment of imagination for Pi, it is his only way of saving himself from insanity on an \\"Ocean of Loneliness\\" and desperation. He believes it to be true. This is the same way that Ennis in the wonderful \\"Brokeback Mountain\\", also protects himself in his own ocean storm, convincing himself that he visits Jack's room, in Jack's family home with the strange settings and the equally strange parents, and retrieves some of Jack's clothing. The visit is a dream, and it gives poor Ennis just a bit of closure with the loss of his only love. The same with Pi. Having lost everything, his closure is yes, indeed, to \\"become the Tiger\\". When he is finally beached and rescued, the Tiger leaving him, without a goodbye, is an essential part of his soul departing, and the complete realization of this change and his tragic loss, breaks Pi's heart.<br /><br />You see, Lee, is a master of the psyche and the heart. He knows how to adapt a novel or screenplay to wring every bit of the \\"real\\" reality of the story, and how through the most compelling of needs, the imagination of humanity must create its fables to save its \\"reality\\", to create \\"alternate realities\\", completely believeable, and to the \\"mind\\", the truest creation of them all. This goes to the utter sadness of this movie, since all Pi has loved had died,and only Pi, the great Tiger of the mind, the admirer of so many religions in his youth, must live on. As his Father suggests early on \\"get reason, first\\". Pi, on the otherhand, survives, while \\"reason\\" finds a horrible and unending death. Fables lead to myths, and then to legends, and these finally are what casts us adrift to ceasely keep navigating our \\"boats against the stream\\". \\"Reason\\", as the Bard said so aptly, \\"doth make cowards of us all\\". I prefer the first version.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I despise self-help books, but a girlfriend I trust recommended this.  While a lot of the advice seems like common sense once you read it, I certainly was unaware of most of it until I read The Five Love Languages.  I've always had a therapist and fully support working on yourself, but something about the way this author approaches the subject really resonated in a way that caused me to change some behaviors to the benefit of my relationships with everyone in my life.<br /><br />Its a quick read, and I felt I learned so much useful information that I've since bought copies for my friends and family.  In fact, I learned that many of them have also read this book...so apparently word is spreading.<br /><br />If you're looking for a way to improve an existing relationship (love, work, family, etc...), or if you're looking for a way to better prepare yourself for the next serious relationship, I highly recommend this book!!
B009XIXVU6|3.0|The story jumped back and forth, making it hard to follow.<br />I loved the previous books, so was very disappointed.
B009ZQJ1G4|5.0|How'd I miss this one before?  I cannot come up with any negatives ... except maybe the explosions  were too fake looking.  I would love to see the follow-up.  Excellent cast that is talented and effective, very fascinating hypothesis on which the story builds, well developed choreography, touching and suspenseful and keeps your attention throughout.  Don't miss this one, I'm glad to finally discover it!
B00004T0US|3.0|The last record Elvis saw released in his lifetime, \\"Moody Blue\\" is a wild and weird mish mash of leftovers from the 1976 Graceland sessions along with a few live tracks to fill out the remaining time. The result is rather uneventful end to Elvis's studio catalog, but there's still some salvagable moments.<br /><br />Let's get the bad out of the way first. Two of the live cuts, covers of Olivia Newton-John's \\"If You Love Me (Let Me Know)\\" and The Diamonds' 1950s' classic \\"Little Darlin',\\" are atrocious. Both are well below the standard an artist of Elvis's stature was worthy of recording, and are testaments to how far he'd fallen as an artist and performer. To say he doesn't do the songs the same justice as their originators is an understatent; \\"If You Love Me\\" isn't that great of a song to begin with, but Elvis fails to give it any attitude to elevate to at least passable. \\"Little Darlin'\\" is insulting, with Elvis trying poorly to emulate the Latin feel of the original with some horrible scatting and falsetto fills before bursting into a fit of laughter and losing all control. The band struggles to capture the proper feel and the whole thing quickly falls apart.<br /><br />With the absolute worst moments out of the way, it's safe to say the rest of the record is considerably stronger, though still far from a masterpiece. Aside from the banal MOR concoction \\"It's Easy for You,\\" the ballads are all very good, expertly arranged and played and Elvis gives commited performances on all of them; best of all would be the country standards \\"He'll Have to Go\\" and \\"She Thinks I Still Care,\\" where Elvis digs deep into the recesses of his lower range to give brooding, sensual and committed readings that do these two classics justice. He struggles a bit on Johnny Ray's \\"Pledging My Love,\\" but the effort is still there.<br /><br />The album's title track (a minor hit) is a surprisingly successful melding of country and disco that Elvis sings extremely well for the time period considering its relatively quick paced lyrical structure. \\"Way Down\\" is a smoking rocker with muscular guitar riffs that unfortunately doesn't quite reach its full potential due to Elvis's subdued vocals; had be been able to cut this tune using a more savage sound a la the 1968 comeback special, this would've ranked up there with \\"Jailhouse Rock,\\" \\"Promised Land,\\" and other classic rockers. Still, the band plays hard, and once again, Elvis is reasonably committed overall.<br /><br />Finally, there's his take on \\"Unchained Melody.\\" His version doesn't scale the heights of The Righteous Brothers, Roy Hamilton, Roy Orbison or the many other legendary vocalists who've tackled this song, but it's nonetheless a fascinating listen. Seated alone at the piano, it's almost to painful to listen as it is to watch (the footage of a puffy, bloated Elvis singing the song at one of his last concerts is widely available), but Elvis is giving all he (still) can here, slowly building the song to a grand finale, taking his time, digging into every word with consideration. A truly heartbreaking performance, but totally worth a listen.<br /><br />\\"Moody Blue\\" is a not a masterpiece, and certainly not what Elvis should've ended his career on, but it's not awful. If you're a fan, it's a worthy listen.sidering its relatively quick paced lyrical structure. \\"Way Down\\" is a smoking rocker with muscular guitar riffs that unfortunately doesn't quite reach its full potential due to Elvis's subdued vocals; had be been able to cut this tune using a more savage sound a la the 1968 comeback special, this would've ranked up there with \\"Jailhouse Rock,\\" \\"Promised Land,\\" and other classic rockers.

Seated alone at the piano, it's almost to painful to listen as it is to watch (the footage of a puffy, bloated Elvis singing the song at one of his last concerts is widely available), but Elvis is giving all he (still) can here, slowly building the song to a grand finale, taking his time, digging into every word with consideration. A truly heartbreaking performance, but totally worth a listen.<br /><br />\\"Moody Blue\\" is a not a masterpiece, and certainly not what Elvis should've ended his career on, but it's not awful. If you're a fan, it's a worthy listen.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is entertaining. Keeps the whole family guessing.  Been fun playing as a family working through the levels together.  Would reccomend to others
B00821OX98|4.0|A little slow to start and felt like its been done before...  Doesn't have that big Spielberg production feel.  Remember that series about aliens taking over several years back, Surface?  Felt a little like that except it has less stealthy aliens and more shoot-em-up.  Not really sure where its going long term and I'm just watching Season 2 now.  Now it's starting to introduce more agendas, spying, traps, ulterior motives, etc.  All in all worth the watch if you are a fan of the sci-fi genre.  Give it the first several episodes to grow on you.  Each season is around 10 episodes.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love this app.you can loose yourself on it for hours. Just make sure you've done your housework first. One of the best apps I've got and the fact it's free memes it better!!
B004XUMMFE|5.0|I didn't know about Firefly when it first aired, but after seeing the entire season and the &#34;wrap up&#34; movie, Serenity, I wish there were more episodes.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game literally is so much fun to play! It was the first game I downloaded on my new kindle!
B009AMAGXK|5.0|I really enjoyed this film, I went to see it with no prior expectations, I felt it was a little Twilight-esque but not quite as cheesy!<br /><br />Jeremy's southern accent gets a bit lost and if you have read the book its a little different, but nevertheless still quite a good film
B00D014E4Y|3.0|I bought this for the special superman mini figure. Felt so cheated when the figure was not included with the set. The information is clearly misleading. For those who wish to get the mini figure with this DVD.. Prepare to be a disappointed.<br /><br />The show was okay for my kids. That was the only consolation to this little transaction for me.
B00E8B1358|4.0|Really good popcorn flick. No deep dramatic message but has good character interaction. Humor in the right places and shows team loyalty.
B00CL68NOG|4.0|I thought the movie was slow at first but as it continued I was caught up in the &#34;Mother and Son&#34; relationship and I found it to be a wonderful movie.  The relationship seemed real and they both said things to each other that helped them both to move forward in their own lives.  Truly a wonderful ending!  Great performances as only Streisand and Rogen could do.  Watch this with your Mother!
B004FP1WX0|4.0|Not sure if this is really a true story. Some things don't add up, but for what it's worth it kept me entertained. I also enjoy the show on MTV.
B002BSHWUU|3.0|I will not write about the sound of this publication.<br />Packaging disgusting. I opened two new boxes and two boxes were scratched CD.<br />For such an ambitious project could do something better.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|Apparently this book is very different from the series which is playing.  Writer describes some wild characters, also achieves a level of self-awareness which is refreshing.
B00007KWHP|5.0|Since I've now reached Medicare age, I've been a bit nostalgic for the music I learned to love in my youth.  For that reason, I've bought a number of CDs first released in the 1960s and 1970s--the period when music became an important part of my every day living.  Oddly enough (or perhaps not so oddly), I have discovered quite a bit of the music I really liked when I was younger no longer seems relevant to me today.  However, some music never seems to get old despite the changes in musical styles that inevitably take place over a half century.  Prime example here is \\"Fragile\\" by Yes.<br /><br />I first heard this album at a friend's house one weekend and promptly fell in love with it.  From the first notes of \\"Roundabout\\" to the final note of \\"Heart of the Sunrise\\", I was mesmerized.  Since I was working at the time for the grand amount of $500 monthly and living as cheaply as possible, I borrowed his album and made a cassette recording of it so I could play it in my beat-up old car with the under-the-dash tape deck that always came loose from the mounting as the car bounced down the road on worn-out shocks and bald tires.  After a time, I managed to buy an LP of \\"Fragile\\" and I played the hell out of it.  Yes released several other albums that friends bought and I listened to them at their homes, however, none of them affected me like \\"Fragile\\".  I recently tried to listen to \\"Close To The Edge\\" again but never got through the whole recording.  That style of music doesn't really appeal to me, however, \\"Fragile\\" is the exception.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|I really enjoyed the story. I would love to find out more about the family at the end of the road. However, I would rather find out in a new book. I'm starting to hate sequels that never finish at least one story.  Great!
B00BI73CVI|4.0|I thought the actors really got into their roles.  I could feel the emotion even though the singing wasn't Broadway quality. I wish they would keep movies cleaner. They could have kept a couple things out.
B00DHHWYAW|4.0|The only thing that stops me from giving it 5 stars is that I've never been a fan of any version of The Great Gatsby, novel or movie.  With that being said, this is an excellent adaptation.  It is loud, vibrant, and over the top in every way it needed to be.  Leonardo DiCaprio was excellent as Gatsby, and i can't think of a single character who was poorly cast (Joseph Gordon Levitt would have made an excellent Nick, but then again I'm biased-i much prefer him as an actor over Tobey Maguire).  It's exactly what you would expect from a Baz Luhrmann production.  The soundtrack is also loud, vibrant and over the top.  It has a dated sound to, while still managing to sound current to 2013 music.
0307887448|5.0|I think John Scalzi called this book a \\"nerdgasm\\", and I really couldn't put it any better.  This book managed both to let me revel in my own 1980's trivia geekdom, while at the same time telling a great science fiction story.  I almost couldn't put it down, and I've recommended it to pretty much everybody older than 30.  Even my wife liked it.  You should get this book!
B00B769XB8|3.0|Not bad, but not good.  It's cheesy and campy, while trying to pass as anything but. It can get pretty graphic in some parts, but never over the top disgusting graphic.  The plot line is thin, and easy to guess, but still amusing.  It treads the wire between Good and Bad, while never fully tipping over to one side or the other.
B0084U0IEG|5.0|Ian Mcewan develops wonderful, flawed and fully-fleshed-out characters. This was a faster read than some of his others. He doesn't go into as much minute detail as in Saturday or Atonement. Loved it and couldn't put it down.
0451419243|4.0|WINTER OF THE WORLD is book two in the Century Trilogy, continuing the story that was begun in FALL OF GIANTS. It tells the story of several families spread about the globe who occasionally cross paths with each other and witness some of the significant historical events between 1933 and 1948. The rise of Hitler and Nazism. The Spanish Civil War. The rise of Communism. The doomed political attempts at avoiding World War II. The misery of the Russian front. Nazi and Communist atrocities. Pearl Harbor. Spies, Russian, German, American and English. The D Day invasion. The research into the atomic bomb.<br /><br /> It's all there, compressed into a highly readable novel.<br /><br /> But that is also the problem. Ken Follett is in a class by himself as a historical novelist and I can only compare him to himself. WINTER OF THE WORLD was not as gripping as its predecessor. To me, the problem was that, though the book is over 900 pages, it's not long enough. Many significant historical events are skipped or greatly compressed. I can understand that--it is, after all, a novel not a historical text--but significant events in the character's lives are also compressed. Emotional crux points, events that should lead to prolonged agonizing for the characters, are snapped through in a page or two. I was left wanting more, much more.<br /><br /> Mr. Follett is a terrific writer and the novel is an exciting and involving read. I would recommend it without hesitation. Again, I say that I can only compare him to himself. WINTER OF THE WORLD is a notch down from his best works.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|I love it - I ordered 3 for me and my family - very informative and music history for all those &#34;albums&#34; we love.
B004INNRFK|5.0|David Foster brings together a diverse group of musicians and singers who take us down his road of musical hits.  Every song in this CD/DVD is great and brings back so many memories.  It is fun to watch the interaction between David Foster and the performers singing the music.  I liked the entire CD/DVD and have just about worn it out watching it again and again.  This is well worth purchasing.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Bought this for my daughter and read it out of boredom.  Ended up loving it and the whole series.  Excellent book!
B006TF6WAM|5.0|What a lovely read. Not in the sense of &#34;can't put it down&#34; but it was an unlikely story, with a surprising turn of events which actually had something to teach you.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Excellent book - would read it again.  I recommend the whole series.  I got hooked when I read The Hunger Games.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I couldn't put it down (for 4 &sup1;/&sup2; hrs) til I completed it! I can't wait for more! Please hurry up with the next installment dev's... I'm in need of my &quot;the room&quot; fix! I'm totally addicted!
0399159347|5.0|Great book about what do really know about the people in our orbit?  Each character of the book is spinning in their own world of work, home life, and their own insecurities. They are all busy, so busy they are living life without really seeing what's going on around them or with the people they love. Parents don't know their own children- they have no idea if someone is bullying them, why they love the subjects they do, or even if they have someone special in their life.  Couples have secrets, as do each of the many different generations. They see each other as fixtures in their lives, accepting  what they choose to believe and being blind to everything else. Each character is a separate identity with hopes, dreams, issues, and lastly dangerous secrets that will affect how they are perceived as well as destroy the illusion they all create to protect themselves.  I read this book in one night, I simply could not put it down. Moiarty propels you into any neighborhood, in any country with relatable characters, all blind to everything except their own perceptions. I don't want to give to much away- but it was brilliant! The Husband's Secret is a box, much like Pandora's that once opened- the consequences are shattering.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Scripts are well written, acting is superb. Great entertainment once again from the BBC!  Can't wait for the next episode!
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|I had only seen average to bad reviews for the movie but it was actually pretty entertaining. Nothing groundbreaking or memorable but still a great movie to rent!
B008BQ8YHQ|4.0|Although I absolutely loved each episode.  I liked it better when they were dealing with outside problems. The problems within the company was getting tiresome. Bring back clients with big problems!  I love the relationships between the character, particularly Harvey and Mike
B0054LJGWS|5.0|I had heard of this book some years back, and happened upon it for Kindle. Imagine an 11 yr old boy having control  of end times, then mix in an angel and demon \\"buddies\\", and some unusual characters, along with a very confused dog!  All I can say is sit back and enjoy!
B00005YUPO|5.0|Had this CD ten years ago for first grandchild, who loved it. Passed down to #2 grandchild, who also loved it. Then, thinking the family was complete, we passed the CD on to friends.  Lo and behold, new grandson born in July!  He could not miss the simple joy of the music and  visuals. I was thrilled to be able to purchase Baby Bach again. It is definitely the best of the Baby Einstein series.
B00ESY77LO|4.0|I stayed awake almost all the way through it.  That makes it a winner in my mind.  It was a real improvement over the 1970's version.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|A must read, and it is life changing for sure.  I so glad that the book found me. AWESOME AWESOME
B00D6QU6RW|5.0|An excellent album by the Backstreet Boys, especially since it's their first indie effort. The songs are just beautiful and catchy and I'm impressed that they actually wrote over 80% of the entire album. This album is a huge milestone for them, being the first album with Kevin back, released on their 20th anniversary, and being their first independent release. I'm expecting more growth from this point onward.<br /><br />Now for the standouts:<br />-The title track is a very fun song, very catchy, and has mature lyrics. It's not a run of the mill love song. Very nice. I expect no less from a Max Martin/BSB collaboration though. And the song only gets better as it goes on, the best part of the song is actually the last part after the bridge. I just can't describe it wirh words it's just so good especially with the ad libs.<br /><br />-Breathe: A beautiful ballad with melancholic feels. Shows maturity.<br /><br />-Show 'Em What You're Made Of: Two group members wrote this song together and dedicated it for their kids. This is arguably the best song on the album. Really has a nice melody, epic chorus and a lovely message. Comparable to Show Me The Meaning Of Being Lonely from Millennium and Siberia from Never Gone.<br /><br />-Trust Me: A song you don't expect from the Backstreet Boys, or any boy band really. It has an organic feels with live instruments and raw vocals. The chorus is extremely fun to sing along with a bunch of friends.<br /><br />-Madeleine and Try: These two are definitely gems. If you're a bubblegum pop lover, these two might take a while to grow on you, but when they do, you won't be able to get these out of your head. Very beautiful, touching songs with nice guitars and raw vocals from McLean and Carter.<br /><br />-Make Believe: Amazing pop song. It has some other worldly feels but at the same time it's classic Backstreet. So catchy and I especially love how the song starts. AJ McLean definitely shines on this song.<br /><br />The other songs are really good too, honestly there's not one bad song on this album, but those 6 are the best in my opinion.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|Though well written and engaging in its way, I don't really like fantasy. Don't know whether this counts as fantasy or not. I like realistic fiction. If I had done more research into this book beforehand, I would never have purchased it or read it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Keeps me coming back over and over to solve.  What a time waster!  (in a good way)... when I am waiting for appointments, on the road, or just &#34;vegging out&#34; at home, this is a fun game...
B009D8RJR2|4.0|One of my favorite Connelly characters.  I try to read all of them.  Read this one really fast.  Read it.
0307279189|5.0|This book offers a suspenseful story, lots of fascinating biographical details of some of the best runners of all times, well researched scientific knowledge about the evolution of us humans and tons of insightful information about running. It is written in a lucid and funny style that makes it interesting even for people who don't run. For those who do or are considering to get into it this book is a rich source of inspiration and motivation.
B008469DGY|5.0|fun game and good graphics.  works great on my kindle fire 1st edition.  I highly recommend it.  download and install it now!
B00466H3DG|5.0|A great movie with a great story and wonderful actors. If you like stories that are a little off beat and original, then go and get this movie now, especially on blu ray.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great season if you want to bawl your eyes out!!! Idk how they can top it! Can't wait til season 4
B004S699K4|5.0|I loved it!!! It is one of my favorite movies out of all of them. It's the best of them all.
0061124958|5.0|The book arrived earlier than promised.  It was in excellent condition.  This book is to be used in my grandson's 3rd grade class.Unable to further comment.
B007K3JCAE|5.0|Usually I end up sorry that I bought a movie, thinking, after viewing it, that we will only watch it once. But this, not so.  We watched it twice and plan on at least once more to really get all of the details. Plus we enjoyed each viewing.  I was especailly happy that the sound was easy to &#34;catch&#34; for our older ears (sometimes in newer movies we have a devil of a time understanding English-Englishin a movie.)  I thought the sets, costumes, casting and score were perfect.  Four thumbs up (two from each of us) from our house!
B006VFLIYK|4.0|Entertaining and a good \\"escape\\" read.  Story has complex elements and engaging characters.  Some of the coincidences are a bit difficult to swallow completely and one really needs to suspend belief.  The abilities of the 14 year-old girl are also somewhat hard to accept.  Overall it was still intriguing.
B00AZKCU7G|5.0|The machinations of politics are nothing new to our time, and this film gave us a double wammy of information on that subject and characters delivered via some great performances.  i an not usualluy a Daniel Day-Lewis fan, but wow, did he ever get Lincoln right, at least to my mind! Give it a chance.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|It took me a while to get into Tina's comedy, because there is a stigma attached to Saturday Night Live for me, and I had to separate her from that in my head. However, once I got over that and started seeing who she was, which comes out in her book even more, I started to enjoy her geeky sense of comedy that fits right in with me.
B00AECGQF2|4.0|I absolutely love this app.  I was sooooooooooo happy when it was the free app of the day. It was free yesterday September 4 2013.
B004QX07G4|4.0|I love Ellen. She may not always make me laugh outright, but she always makes me smile and always makes me feel good.
B00ESY7QXI|3.0|Too much hype may have made this a little disappointing that it was so quirky, but it got better as it went on to a surprise ending!
B000XXTCF8|4.0|these songs were from my high school days, so If you are 55+ and like rock and roll, do the demo's or look up the songs on you tube. Moondance and Brown eyed girl, are a few of my favorities. I'm happy to hear these songs after so many years.
B004JMY312|5.0|I love this film as did my children when growing up. It is worth watching over and over and over again.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Jack Reacher is one of my favorite characters. Lee Child is one of my favorites. Have read this book many times and enjoy it every time. Have read all of his books and enjoyed everyone!!
B008N4XC2I|5.0|took a gamble on getting this album from an recommendation from a friend. The songs are good but the pressing quality is above standards. It has great bass and just demands the volume to be turned up! Surprisingly happy!
B00BT1XCOU|5.0|1st of all ill do my best not to write a review how much I love this show.truthfully started out not giving this show a chance at all .if you're single and need a uplifting inspiring . New way to lift your spirits please do watch this show. Its a group of friends that are family . And been through some turn of events that have you saying wow.it holds its own comedy with its own original ideas and even words.do your self one of the biggest favors you.could do for your self watch the seasons . And thank your self for doing it with a huge smile
B005ZB91KY|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie...great plot, great action, superb special effects, a super good hero and a perfectly evil villain,
1442421037|5.0|It was a tad slow at first, which usually makes me quit reading a book, but it picked up and turned out awesome. I am hooked. I just purchased the next 2 in the series.
B002JXK5VU|4.0|Just finished up this first season, It's a fun show. I plan on watching all that is available on prime.
6305128952|5.0|Great visual film. The sweeping countryside and mountains make for a great backdrop. Initially I thought that Scarlett Johannson's character was a brat but eventually she breaks down and we sympathize with her.<br /><br />I was definitely more of a fan of Kristin Scott Thomas's character - a lady who did what she had to do but discovered she still had a heart. Too bad she and Robert Redford did not do a love scene, like in the book. Robert Redford is still fairly good-looking in this one.
B000F5GNX8|5.0|One of the best movies I've ever seen...very enjoyable! I wish Val and RD Jr. would do another movie together.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|This is a very fun game. It's amazing how you can streak through levels with ease and then you get stuck on the simple things. Great game to pass the time.
B009LQKHIO|5.0|IT WAS A WONDERFUL BOOK.  I  LOVED IT SO MUCH  I BOUGHT ALL I COULD FIND. AND LOOK FORWARD TO MANY MORE.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|It's okay.  Didn't keep me real interested.  Only did the easier ones.  Maybe would be more interesting if I got to the harder ones.
B00AYR2FOI|4.0|What a treat to enjoy a new work by Boz Scaggs.  His works of the 70's and 80's never seemed to leave my head and it was a thrill to rediscover this great american talent.
0761129235|5.0|In today's culture, commercials and self-help advocates promote the concept of \\"just doing it\\" or in other words, making radical, instant change. Well, life doesn't work that way for the vast majority of people. Governments don't change overnight, culture and organizations don't change overnight, and neither do people. Dr. Maurer presents an option that does work and that has been proven again and again. Small, incremental changes do work. Even if they appear insignificant, they gain momentum and substance like a snowball going downhill. Change must start slowly and with intent, with the smallest of improvements so that the brain doesn't instantly reject them out of fear. I highly encourage everyone to read this book... to understand how to affect lasting change to themselves and all of society's institutions.
B007JZGIMS|5.0|This is my favorite app. I use it 24-7.when I download a song it downloads the video with it I can create playlists and manage my eq.<br />Verry satisfied
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|I was especially struck by how bloody some of the Jewish movements were in that era, much as Muslims and Christians would be in the following centuries. This is another book that demonstrates what a joke it is when a Christian, a Jew or a Muslim tries to tell you that those other guys are the bad boys.<br />When all is said and done, they have all been confused zealots in their conceited conviction that they are the good boys.
B009PNQUXO|5.0|love finding recording from old bands and remakes from artists. also love the funny stuff,. my favorite is american idol worst its way too funneeee
0783226845|5.0|a feel good movie for viewers of all ages<br />i purchased this as a gift for my aunt who just loves the young  chris o'donnell
B009JZSFUY|4.0|One of the better Star Trek movies, but time for some new characters and adventures.  The Borg are about worn out.
B0058YPL66|4.0|i love it , an up to date version of what happened to  those &#34;once upon a time&#34; stories i read as a kid
B005544TRQ|5.0|Smart, sexy fun. Don't watch much TV shows but thought this might be a good one. This series is totally enjoyable and very entertaining.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Great to rescue others in trouble, and monkeys are just right for the others. Good graphics and color, action is good. This one is best so far.
B00EEDJM2Q|4.0|Simple but addictive!  Only one complaint- scissors sometimes don't register that I've cut the buttons.  Irritating when focusing on time and points. But I still love it.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Need more puzzles to solve, otherwise good to relax to. Too bad they have so few to solve as it is good to do.
B008M721MS|1.0|The Kindle tablet version of skype is terrible!  I always have to check my phone first to see if friends are on.  Then I have to uninstall and reinstall on my tablet.  Please fix this!
B00BOUL9DM|5.0|Try to find word that describes all 4 pics, some easy, some thinking required, but fun and good to do for spelling too.
0385523394|5.0|It was a fantastic read. I loved the way she weaves the humanity of her fellow prisoners into her own story all while interegrating thought provoking details about the prison system in this country. The book was enjoyable and pushed me to really consider life outside my comfort zone. I am so glad I read this memoir. I will say it is different that the Netflix series. Jenji Kohan used Kerman's book as a jumping off point, not a script. So don't be surprised by he different of an experience they are.  That being said, I enjoyed both the series and book very much.
B005H9B2CE|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed the flick, very entertaining and good for a family night. Loki ? What is not to dislike ;)

B00C2IJJLO|5.0|Classic neo noir. Loved the story, direction, and performances. The transfer on the steel book blu ray is stunning. Great release.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I really enjoy this version of Spider solitaire.  It has so many different options you can use to customize your experience.  You can change background, card backs, card faces, congratulation screens, ect. . .  I love the abilitly to choose the number of suits, and the statistics pages.  It is just a lot of fun.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|i love this book it is an absolutely great book and i recommend it to anyone! read it and you wont be disappointed

B004TMPJP6|5.0|Gotta keep track of appointments and tasks?  This is a great app to do just that.  You even have the opportunity to create sublists!  Sublime!  I have tried most of the productivity apps out there and this one is simple, quick and actually helps me stay on track.  Yay!
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|I am having a lot of fun playing this game.  Although, I wish I didn't have to purchase packages to get the full effect.
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|The Kindle USB cable itself is fine, ( a house guest accidentally took my original away we think) , but I ended up paying over $36  for a $9.99 item due to postage to Australia. There were several used ones on  offer costing a few cents but none would ship here. I've since found out I could have gone to KMart or somewhere and got a generic one for few dollars, ....so silly me eh.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I am having a lot of fun playing this game.  I just don't like having to purchase other packages to get the optimal effect.
B00EAI9CSY|4.0|Like others who commented, was expecting to see people turn into crazy monsters with super strength, etc...  However what was given was actually a slow, but good story.
B000FC0OOU|5.0|If you like Hemmingway, you will like this book.  Classic tale of the Spanish Civil War prior to WWII.  Enjoy!
B003YL4KS0|4.0|This book has changed my life and has saved me tons of time getting ready every day.  It took a good 6 weeks to fully grasp my routine and I nearly went back to blow drying, hot irons, and curling irons.  So happy that I didn't.  I got ready in about 20 minutes this morning....including shower, makeup, and getting dressed.  I've learned to go two, three days using a refresher mist in the morning as opposed to full hair cleansing...four if I put my hair in a bun!  The time I've saved eliminating the daily blow dryer by itself has given me much more sleep time!  I've made several of the recipes in the book and use daily.  Spot cleaning with lavender mist, refreshing curls with conditioner/water mister, adding shine to dull hair with another very easy-to-use recipe that I can't recall the name.  Anyway, if you're thinking of doing this method, buy the book.  There is much more information in it than you can find online.  Also, give yourself time adjusting to the look.  I thought I had thick, course hair that I blow dried straight and then either curled or hot ironed.  I had no idea that I had ringlets and S waves throughout my hair.  Getting adjusted to the new &#34;ever changing&#34; look took time.  Now I love it and embrace it.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|this app is fabulous!  I highly recommend it!  I use it daily and enjoy the various options that it offers.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The only thing I don't like about this game is that my entire family keeps taking my kindle to play it.  We all love it.  Fast paced and addicting.
B000FC1MCS|4.0|I felt this was a very interesting story. I almost related to the main character. I highly recommend this book. The only down side is the amount of swearing in the text. Otherwise, the themes were great, and it was enjoyable!
B00CXAAG6I|5.0|This whole book is hysterical ... Grumpy Cat is so nasty and so negative that you can't help but love him!!!!
B007F5S1GS|5.0|what can't i say about them. the Smiths started a whole new sound with Marr on guitar and Morrissey at the mike.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Not bad reminds me of middle command...fun for a while but not so outstanding I am just ratings poo get more points
0515153656|2.0|Most reviewers here seem to have pretty low standards.  My 10 year old self would have been able to tell that this book is poorly written and researched. I'm still baffled as to how it got published and even more baffled that anyone would think it merits 5 stars.  A look at the one and two star reviews will reveal all that you need to know if you're considering buying this mess.  Maybe the writing improves as the series progresses, but this dog of a book left me with no desire to find out.  I'm giving it 2 stars because I actually finished it even though my heart tells me it deserves 1 star.
B00006EXDM|5.0|The Rolling Stones are in a class of their own and this two disc set includes most but not all of their best hits. Angie is not there and there are probably other missing favorites. But you get 21 great hits. Did they ever record even one song that was not a hit ?<br />  Grew up listening to this great band. Went to war listening to them. Came home and got laid plenty listening to this band. If you are a young person who wants a notion of what it was like to live in that era, this music will get you there. Gee I feel like a man again just listening to them.<br />  Every song on this set a great hit. I will stop now. I could blather on but choose not to.  ...Oscar
B002PE0HCU|4.0|Really liked this movie and wanted to share it with my daughter. Just watch alfred hitchcock about tippie hendren and the making of the birds.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I was not surprised by the twist in the plot, not that I heard about it before but they had to do something to spice things up.  Matthew and Mary's relationship was too perfect.
B0058D77S2|3.0|Wish they were easier to understand but love everything else. Love the characters and the modern day version of the movie.
B00CXVX1OQ|3.0|Yeah watching monkeys punch is fun for a minute but then it just becomes repetitive.  No real strategies or changes in style needed throughout.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|om my gosh dont even get me started this game is awesome omg i just love this game oh and everbody that reads this is awesome
0142421715|3.0|As Cassia journeys to the Outer Provinces in search of Ky she is able to unlock more of the secrets Society has kept from her. Ky on the other hand is looking for an escape, he has too much to hide and needs to get back to Cassia to figure everything out. As they each go on their separate journeys to find each other they end up finding more about themselves in the process.<br /><br />This series went from starting out as the first book being one of my favorites to just having a mediocre book. I am still going to read the third in the series but I was highly disappointed with the outcome of this book.<br /><br />I did like in this book how we got to hear from Ky and have his perspective on things but then again it was kind of needed since they were not even together for most of the book. Unlike within the first book I felt like the characters were more one-dimensional and lacked the intensity and emotion they did while they were actually in Society being watched. Cassia's role seemed more downplayed and she did not come off as a heroine or anyone that could remotely be able to help the Resistance.<br /><br />The introduction of Eli and Indie was a plus. Both of their characters shined through, especially Indie's. Although I still do not fully trust her or her intensions she made the parts with Cassia more enjoyable to read.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I haven't finished this novel as of yet as it is pretty long, but I am very impressed with this author's writing and story-telling skills.  The stories are amazing and I love reading them on my subway and ferry commutes to work each day.
0312360266|1.0|16-year-old Zoey Redbird is marked and her whole entire life as she knows it gets turned upside down. Now she has to go to the school, House of Night, where she will train to become an adult vampire, that is if she survives the Change.<br /><br />I pretty much never not continue on with a series (yeah I know how that sounds) but this one was just horrendous. I didn't like the characters, I didn't find the plot interesting, and I was overly annoyed by how the characters speak. I love vampires but there is not much (or anything I can think of) that is redeeming about this series. I am not going to continue on, it would be too painful, and I am not going to recommend this to anyone, even my worst enemy, in the fuure.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|It's Pink Floyd nothing else needs to be said.<br />If your a true FLOYD fan you have to own this to keep your memories alive!!!
B000F8O35U|5.0|The movie was awesome! The condition was Better than expected. Watched it last night and it played great! Love this movie!
B0091QSNEE|5.0|The Dr, Panda games are great! So many activites to keep little ones interested and are so much fun for them. This one is such a great learning experience for little girls...my little one loves to help cook.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Can always count on King to give us a different perspective.  He never disappoints.  Not like his regular fare, but very thought provoking.
B00CTKHXFO|5.0|The Metal Gear Solid Legacy Collection includes all the canon games in the Metal Gear series, and it is a perfect way for new fans to get into the series before Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain releases. Eight games, an art book, and two fully narrated graphic novels at the price of $50 makes this collection a value that can't be beat.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is fun and is a challenge to think outside the box so to speak.  You progress at your own speed and see your<br />accomplishments.
B00BLRXDTQ|5.0|...being hailed as ultraviolent.... max only fires his gun 5 times in the whole 3 film series.<br />didn't know that did you.
B008JFUR10|3.0|Someone forgot to tell Charlie that Pacific Rim is not a movie about thugs. Charlie's demeanor throughout the movie was one of a thug. The way he walks and the way he talks says total thug. He kept portraying himself as a tough thug guy when the character persona does not call for a thug. This was very distracting and could have killed the entire movie all together. What saved Charlie was the fantastic fighting scenes, the story line, and the lovely Rinko. I guess Charlie thought he was still acting on the Sons Of Anarchy set. Hopefully he will do better next time.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This App not only works great as an alarm clock, it tells the weather outside to help plan your wardrobe for the day.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Clare's writing depicts a beautiful world, one I would love to live in. One of my favorite books of all time.
B004GYY714|5.0|This app gives you all the music you are looking for.<br />You can go around the world with the stations available and the music style you can find in it!
B00BHMETKC|4.0|... the movie was not spoiled though he was the lead actor. One of the better movies of 2012 I saw, and definitely intrigued me enough to read about the actual events after watching the movie.
B008602KQI|2.0|the hunger games was 'average'---at best---<br />However, I am biased, because I generally dis-like most/all films I watch which fall within the genre/category of either (or both) Sci-Fi, and/or Fantasy movies.  I have yet to rate a film in the SciFi/Fantasy genre above a 2/5. And this movie gets a 2/5. So if u like Sci-Fi and Star Trek type of movies/shows....then you will definitely LOVE this movie!....even if you dont like Sci-Fi / Fantasy type of movies....you won't be totally wasting your money by renting this movie. It is somewhat entertaining....I would recommend this movie ONLY if you are a SCIENCE FICTION and/or FANTASY type of movie person. eithewr way...it is worth seeing if you have spare time on your hands and are bored. IT IS WORTH RENTING! MY RATING: C
B001DJ69E8|5.0|I absolutely love this CD. I will be looking for more music from this group and similar music from others in the near future.<br /><br />Thank you.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|It talks all the way through the book about a ending to a book that was unknown...then we get left with not knowing how her life turns out...loved it...can't wait for the next one
B0090X4GLW|4.0|If you obsessively love this movie like I do then you will find this soundtrack is a nice addition to your music stash...still more fun to watch the movie..
B001NLL93W|5.0|Had one of the best plots Ohio I have ever read. it was an amazing book to read can't wait for the next
B000009ROK|5.0|This is a CD of very romantic music. Great for an evening for just the two of you, little dancing and romancing. Would definitely recommend this CD!
B00571F26Y|5.0|Having had a hard time for so many years to loose and keep off weight I decided to get this book. I am on day three of wheat free. Feeling pretty good, I do have the withdrawals that he mentioned. I am going to keep it up for a month and see how I feel.
B002ZG9774|4.0|This movie was recommended to us by friends. It's cool, music awesome, and ladies are nice to look at. Story is pretty good. Would recommend to anyone liking this type of music flick!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I really Love this show. The only thing I hate is how long in between seasons. I highly recommend it.
B001QWBM62|5.0|The quality of the recording is almost unbelievable. It is professional quality and can be easily used to make you CD.
B0083DJWGO|1.0|I could not get past the first 5 pages.  It did not make any sense to me.  He jumps around a lot.
B00B4804KS|5.0|this is one of the best 3d movies i have seen and i have approx 20 of them BUY IT !!!!
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love playing Dragon story. It's a very fun game. I just downloaded Dragon story a few days ago. To night I was playing and I had a goal and it showed a picture of a dragon I don't remember the name of the Dragon but in the box is a picture of the Dragon the name of it and then on the right side of the box is 2 buttons a yellow button that says skip and a green button. Well I made a mistake and clicked on the yellow skip button. I had 23 gold bars and when I clicked on the skip button it took away all 23 of my gold bars. Can you please help me and give me back my 23 gold bars please. Thank you  My storm id. Is golden park .  Thank you
B00A8ECU24|1.0|My daughter has played this game for a few months. It has numerous glitches and if you want to get some of the more popular ponies it can cost quite a bit! While you can play for free it very disheartening at the ridiculous cost to get buy gems.  It would literally take you years of free play to earn enough gems for some of the more expensive ponies.  Not to mention that we've spent money to get gems & now since the most recent Gameloft update the game does not load at all anymore.  Not happy..would definitely not ever spend money on another Gameloft Game.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I have this on my phone &amp; my Kindle fire. It has helped me numerous times to free up some space that was needed. When my device starts to seem slow, I  let clean master do its thing and it always helps. Instead of me looking through the device one piece at a time, Clean Master scans it all and asks if you want to clean it before it gets rid of anything. I have found it very helpful. Besides that I got it for the best price...free Thanks Clean Master!
B00AECGQF2|5.0|it great i mean im 8 and i apsolutly love wery fun Try it its amazayn see what i did there u did (Ama Zayn Amazayn
B005544TRQ|5.0|I am hooked on this show and I can't decide which leading man is hotter! This one is worth every minute.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|Um it's really should be worth 200 dollars the graphics are amazing you will be surprised of how good they are
B00AECGQF2|4.0|The ability for this app's users to create different cartoon hair styles is a creative spin on a more traditional drawing or coloring book type of app. It's a great open-ended way to express oneself in a fashion-related digital interaction. That said, how the heck can we turn off the sounds when desired??? And it would be nice to have a brush to apply colors or highlights more precisely, and to be able to &quot;style&quot; the models' clothing somewhat to match a hairstyle that is created...  We do all watch Project Runway, afterall, and know that hair and makeup are key elements of a look along with the clothing the individual is wearing. ;)
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|An enjoyable movie for both kids and adults.  My seven year old son and I were laughing out loud at times.
B00EQUP3Q6|5.0|I like the new Nine Inch Nails album. It's different, controversial among NIN fans, with some jarring surprises, but I think it's his best since The Fragile.<br /><br />To some Hesitation Marks sounds like a follow up to Pretty Hate Machine. Actually it sounds like Pretty Hate Machine is a darker angrier follow up to this.<br /><br />I'm a long time NIN fan. They were my favorite band when I was 14 in high school until I really dived into Tool. This new album isn't on the same level as iconic classics like Pretty Hate Machine, Broken, The Downward Spiral, or The Fragile, but it's pretty good, and A LOT better than With Teeth or Survivalism or The Slip. So I'm glad to see that Trent has regained his footing here. I don't mind that Hesitation Marks is different, because it's creative cool music.<br /><br />There was a progression arc of getting angrier and darker after Pretty Hate Machine, and it feels like the ethos of this new album actually fits right into that arc, but placed BEFORE Pretty Hate Machine. Which is kind of cool actually, because I was a bit disappointed since With Teeth, and even though Hesitation Marks is so different in some ways, it also feels to me like the Nine Inch Nails I love is back!<br /><br />There are a couple low points (Everything and All Time Low). Satellite sounds like it's a song by Apparat on his [[ASIN:B004VW1PUM Walls]] album, but that's a good thing, Apparat is amazing. I really love Copy of A and In Two.<br /><br />Trent Reznor is pushing 50 and he still pushed himself to come up with something fresh and clever. Respect.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|Great book, very entertaining and easy to read. All my friends agree that this was an awesome book. I highly recommend it
B00AP9RQE4|4.0|I did like it.  It was light and entertaining.  It did a good job of playing on her older books history and personalities.
B001I45UFC|5.0|This is an excellent book! The thrills never stop! I recommend this book to anyone who can truly and fully enjoy a great work of literature!
B00847KFDS|5.0|Just two new tunes, but new arrangements and partners bring some good energies to the older material. Well worth the listen.
B00BOA9MVI|5.0|This is a fantastic story that grabbed my attention from the very first page. I read the book in under three days. The interviews on the web were inspiring.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|I love this series.  I am ery pleased with this product.  Would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes this show.
B005H0CBZ0|5.0|Loved it, as is usual for this series :-) The ending was a bit sudden but that just means that I want to go on to the next one!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Love how all the stories are interwoven beautifully.  This author is an amazing story teller.  I couldn't put it down.
B00AQMSJI2|5.0|This game is enjoyable.  The only thing that bothers me is the way it's more like a puzzle trying to find places for buildings.
