1611761565|5.0|I am so glad that I pre ordered this on CD.  It is an excellent first hand account of the life of one of the Seals that was on the mission to take down UBL as they called him.  I especially likes the last disk and the way he describes his feelings about the way the Seals were treated.  It is a must read in my book.
B003UV8TFE|5.0|After watching most of Professor Lewin's open courseware videos I decided to purchase his book.  His voice and excitement in the lectures permeates through his writing as well!  \\"For the Love of Physics\\" is a great read and only helped to motivate me to learn more about the wonders of this world.
B008JEJPSC|4.0|I have put off buying Annie on DVD for many years because of the lack of widescreen. With the newly released blu-ray, Annie is finally available in widescreen.<br /><br />The picture quality is not on par with the most newer movies, but I wasn't expecting Sony to invest heavily into giving us a pristine experience.<br /><br />The sing-along is a nice bonus feature.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|Eva and Gideon are so messed up, it's at times heart-wrenching and at other times heart-warming to read about them together. They admit to their own co-dependent obsession to one another, but that doesn't stop them from acting on every whim, feeling, and self-protective bone in their bodies.<br /><br />Oh, and they bone a lot.<br /><br />Reflected In You, Sylvia Day's follow-up book to the insanely popular, Bared To You, comes out on October 2nd. If you've read Bared, you've probably had the date circled in your calendar with puffy hearts decorating the day. If you haven't yet read Bared, you're so lucky to have these two books out together so you don't have to go through the agonizing wait for Reflected.<br /><br />Aside from the warm-in-my-bits sex scenes, the continuing story of Eva and Gideon made me want to throw my hands up in the air and demand they both get over their shit. I'm continuously thanking my lucky stars that my craziness doesn't make me as high-maintenance as these two sexpots. There's no way I could survive an obsession with another person like Eva or Gideon. But at least they have one another.<br /><br /> - [My love] was fragile. It needed to be nurtured in order to thrive and grow.<br /><br />Reading the following line summed up the entire book for me, and when you read it, you'll totally get it. )Or maybe you'll get it just from having read Bared. Or maybe you just get Gideon enough to get this meaning.):<br /><br /> - \\"He said it has to be this way. I don't even know what that means.\\"<br /><br />Reflected In You will take over the top spot on the bestsellers lists. Sayonara, 50 Shades Of Grey. There's a new smut series that's done topping from the bottom; Crossfire is taking over Dominance.<br /><br />Get it. Read it. Obsess over it.

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game. I am do addicted and so is my family. I play for hours. This is the best game I have ever played.
0316228532|1.0|Not worth reading. Dull, cheap, vulgar, low, obscene, unrealistic, boring, humorless.<br /><br />Story line was non-existent, not a single character is worth empathizing with. Reads like a cheap fan fiction.<br /><br />If JKR actually wrote this then she has some serious serious issues. If anyone else had written this book it would never have been published. Even online websites would have been forced to filter the content.<br /><br />Throwing in obscene material doesn't make it an adult's book. Characters with the intellect of a dull penny doesn't make it a young adult's book.<br /><br />In hindsight, what would one expect when the same author ends the HP series by coldly snuffing half the characters.<br /><br />Deserves NEGATIVE infinity stars.<br /><br />Suffice to stay, it's worth PAYING for overnight shipping to return this garbage.

0240815807|5.0|I rarely take the time to write reviews but this fantastic book definitely deserves a review!  I have a whole library of acoustics and audio recording books and Mixing Secrets is one of my favorites!

If you only have one book on audio production, make it this one!!!  Thank you Mike Senior!!!

Sprinkles in some more classics to keep me interested and watching the full DVD. I had hopes when I bought this DVD that Gilmour would play the songs he is noted for but was mildly disappointed, it's the least of my viewed DVD'S not happy I bought it.

B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I bought Chris Kyle's book American Sniper for my husband.  Being curious, I immediately got hooked on the operations of the Navy Seals which lead me to read Fearless.  After reading this book several months ago, I still can't forget the details.  It was and is the best book I've ever read.  His faith in God and his story has the ability to touch so many, and I feel this book can change a life.  It must be hard for his family to have lost such a remarkable person.  However, that loss resulted in one of the greatest stories and is shared with us as readers and I know that Adam would be proud to know that the Lord is still using him to touch so many. You laugh, get angry, laugh, and cry.  It's a good book in so many ways for both men and women.
B004UID2LC|1.0|This app worked for a couple weeks now everytime I'm trying to download or even view a video, it says connection error when my connection is full bars. I tried re-installing it a couple times, but it says the same error. Either fix this app or take it off the market.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I typically like this app, but some days it just won't load, and that gets super frustrating. I still love pinterest, and it's super nice to have it so handy.

B008G12ERC|5.0|The new Muse album is fantastic.  In typical Muse fashion, they incorporate different musical styles with lots of energy overall, but with enough variation to avoid tedium.  Some of it reminds me of the electronic stuff that U2 did in the 1990s.  There is an orchestral interludes that borrows from Rachmaninoff.  Other parts sound like Queen, complete with those silly operatic voices.  Some tracks remind me of the hard-pop-rock sound of Evanescence.  They started this experimental style on their last album, but they've taken it to the next level and it's completely mind-blowingly awesome album.
B000FC1KBG|4.0|This book is very helpful for new moms trying to learn how to understand and help their baby through early infancy. Although not exhaustive or fool-proof, it gives many helpful hints, tips and suggestions, many of which were very helpful to me as I tried to learn how to keep my new baby on a schedule. Before I had my own, I considered myself to be pretty good with babies, but you're never completely prepared for having one of your own! This book helped me feel more empowered and prepared as a new mother.
B008RV5K5E|4.0|Very well told story.  The action/animation is prime and the music score is perfect.<br />The thing I have to point out there are too many news cut scenes which kind of took away from the story and was somewhat annoying.
B003O86FMW|5.0|By far one of the best book series i have ever encountered. Suzanne Collins has you obsessed from the first book. I didn't know what to do when i was done

B00136RYXG|5.0|M!ssundaztood is the second studio album by recording artist Alicia Moore (aka Pink, preferred name: P!nk). Here's the TBT (track-by-track):<br />1. M!ssundaztood. P-I-N-K is back with some sass in this song! It's an awesome opening song (especially considering that she wasn't AT ALL popular when this album was first out.) She did good with what she had! 5 out of 5.<br />2. Don't Let Me Get Me. P!nk should never be \\"compared to damn Brittany Spears\\" (as she says in the song), because P!nk is ten times better than Brittany spears. And, of course, she proves that she can sing better than Brittany in this album! Wonderful song, and it made her Greatest Hits album! 5 out of 5.<br />3. Just Like A Pill. One of the first P!nk songs I remember ever hearing on the radio. It's fun, and catchy as frig! I enjoyed it very much every time I heard it! 5 out of 5.<br />4. Get The Party Started. Hailed as being P!nk's first \\"song\\" (and, if memory serves correctly, this is the first song to receive a music video), and it certainly deserves the high praise it got.  4 out of 5, for memory purposes.<br />5. Respect. I don't really remember this song, but I'll give it 4 out of 5.<br />6. 18 Wheeler. I have this CD, but I never heard the song from this album. I heard it from her Live from Wembley concert. I love the song! 5 out of 5.<br />7. Family Portrait. All the hurt many people endure every day, put into a song about family struggles. I adore it, and am therefore giving it 5 out of 5 stars.<br />8. Misery. Another underrated P!nk song. 4 out of 5.<br />9. Dear Diary. This is the first album in which P!nk pours her heart out about her family. I didn't get any family discussion from Can't Take Me Home, but this album is partially her autobiography. It is empowering and will help other struggling families.<br />10. Eventually. I was hoping it would eventually come to an end! 3 out of 5.<br />11. Lonely Girl. Linda Perry was one of the main people to make P!nk popular, and I thank her for that! She sang really good in this album with P!nk as well! 5 out of 5.<br />12. Numb. No other words. 5 out of 5.<br />13. Gone To California. I don't remember ever hearing this song before, but I know I did. So, it gets 4 out of 5.<br />14. My Vietnam. She talks about her life as being a major war-ground. Beautiful! 5 out of 5.<br />Overall, it gets 5 out of 5 stars from me! IGNORE THE HATERS, IGNORE THE LOVERS... BUY THE ALBUM YOURSELF!
B008QE9VJI|4.0|I avoided seeing this in theaters because 1) it got terrible reviews and 2) none of my friends would go with me because of said terrible reviews. By the time I got around to seeing it by myself, it was already gone. Lucky me though: it was available to watch on a flight a couple of weeks ago. I like Tim Burton well enough and I love Johnny Depp so I was expecting to be \\"meh\\" about it. I was most certainly *not* expecting to love it as much as I did.<br /><br />For starters, it's beautiful. The costumes by the fabulous Colleen Atwood are gorgeous. The people - Johnny Depp, Eva Green, Michelle Pfeiffer, Chloe Grace Moretz, Bella Heathcote, et al. - are gorgeous, as are the hair and make-ups. The sets are gorgeous. Secondly, the humor is awesomely stupid and deadpan (\\"I'm pretty sure he called me a hooker.\\" \\"This is a very silly play.\\" \\"Ugliest woman I've ever seen.\\" - hahaha!!) And I thought Johnny Depp was terrifically silly. I adored Barnabas. And the music. And all the Brits playing Americans. Of Burton's films, I'd say this is the most like the fabulous Sleepy Hollow, which I also loved.<br /><br />It's not in the least bit deep and doesn't take itself seriously in the least. Clearly it's not for everyone, and I wonder if people would have given it more of a chance if it had NOT been a Tim Burton film!
1416562605|2.0|Pity the gullible intellectual of the West who is so stunned by the tales of misery and malfeasance in the other world--the world of five billion people who drift along the waves of crime and corruption everyday only to stay afloat. This is India--one of a hundred or so nations whose inhabitants maze through decadence and debauchery everyday as a way of going around. To them, what's so spectacular in passing a politician a few lakhs to get income tax \\"adjusted?\\" To them, what's so special about \\"serving\\" an employer with the last remaining fiber in your body, and yet offer your ribs whenever he feels like kicking them? They see nothing wrong cherishing killer \\"entrepreneur\\" dispositions, when the only way left to move forward is off the cliff. These references quoted here are not in jest. They simply employ alternative definitions in the local vernacular. This is just how the society is set up, irrespective of the statutes of morality or common law. Displaying a flabbergast for such commonplace matters amounts to, either living the life of solitary confinement, or at best, a sheer disregard for the plight of the two thirds of the world population. Stupefied must have been the judges of The Man Booker Prize, when pondering Aravind Adiga's `The White Tiger' for this ultimate prize in literary fiction. The Man Booker Prize is venerated for appreciating eonian themes and unequalled literary value of the submitted manuscripts. Little did they know in 2008 that the theme of class warfare, recounted through the fictional letters of Blaram Halwai to the Chinese Premier, is antiquated and banal in the other world, unworthy of any special mention, the least of which would be by an entity, as august as The Man Booker. For the literary device, Aravind borrows clich&eacute;d ciphers of cages and coops for the serving classes, and mongoose and snakes for the served; the metaphors so overused, they are not heard any more.  For the occasional odd one in the society, who somehow unshackles himself from the manacles of status quo, the author uses the worn-out reference to a tiger, only white though--hence the title, The White Tiger. Notwithstanding a truer depiction of the appalling socio-economic milieu of the twenty-first century India, and for that matter, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and almost every other underdeveloped society, the turbidity of this book has palled the brilliance of the award. It's not the first time that an author of Indian descent has ranked among the likes of Ian McEwan, Howard Jacobson, Hillary Mantel, or Salman Rushdie; it's just the first time perhaps in the award's history that mediocrity has been mistaken for excellence. Neither the motifs of simmering revulsion to the status quo in the corrupt societies, nor the maneuverings of the rich and powerful to maintain it would stir the torpor of a common man. At best, they might earn a shrug and a laugh, topped with an expletive. That's the real value of the subject matter in this novel. Nonetheless, I did enjoy the entertaining Tamil accented English of the narrator in the audio version of the book. This alone must have helped me get through the entire book, without losing myself into the surrounding scenery on my usual long commute. Were it only for the insipid subject mater, I would have ranked it by `The Finkler Question' of Howard Jacobson, but it failed to meet even the language standard that is a hallmark of all such noteworthy publications. The text complexity should measure for a sixth grade reader by the literacy standards of Indian education, which is pretty high among the English-speaking countries. There is hardly any humor worthy of a chuckle, which the author occasionally takes pain to extract from his readers. It's an old Bollywood movie rewritten in the early 21st century India. Aravind should go read Life of Pi by Yann Martel to learn how to tell a good Indian story.<br /><br />(Two Stars Out of Five)s himself from the manacles of status quo, the author uses the worn-out reference to a tiger, only white though--hence the title, The White Tiger.

B006DZYM0A|5.0|Do you want to see the best American acting of actress since Portman in Swan?  Do you want to see a movie that challenges what you thought you knew?  Do you want moral choices and also mortal ones?  What about what horrible things parents do to they're kids after divorce?  Also sexual choices that are in shades of grey?  Then watch Margaret.  As Lisa PAquin will break your heart and make you root, yes ROOT for her quest even though she yells a lot, but what 18 year old rich girl doesnt.  This  is about how her world changes.  The title comes from a poem by Gerald Manley Thomkins it is about greivinga dn there is a lot of it in this movie dont listen to teh haters.  And that cast Broderick, Reno, Damon--yes peo-ple DAMON and also the mom was good but no one would recognize her name.If you dont want to be challenged and think and cry then dont watch Margaret starring Paquin, watch Taken instead.
B000JMKTLO|3.0|I bought this after reading \\"Gone Girl\\" and hearing from friends that Flynn's other books were good. It's an interesting read but just know that it's far more violent (and grotesque) than \\"Gone Girl.\\" But still, not a bad read at all, just more like a standard mystery/horror book than \\"Gone Girl,\\" which I thought was a really smart psychological thriller. NOTE: I started Flynn's second novel, \\"Dark Places,\\" right after finishing this one and I like it *much* better. One thing is for sure: Flynn is great at writing about (or from the perspective of) seriously damaged female characters.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I'm retired military.<br />I read the book looking for inappropriate disclosures of classified material.<br />I didn't find any; particularly after reading the forward/intro to the book which discusses the review of all material by military authority, prior to publishing.<br /><br />Good review of a particular SEAL's career.<br />Thank you for your service.

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|No doubt that the movie is amazing. 3D effects are awesome and look neat (not in-your-face 3D) on TV. For a $20 package (4disc combo), I am very satisfied with the product. Not to mention the extras that come with the combo. Looking forward to more such 3D combo deals (<$20) for commercial movies.
0345803485|1.0|This book is complete trash. It is very poorly written and it is a sign of the times that it made the best seller list. It is trying to romanticize pedophilia and sexual abuse to make it more acceptable in society.<br />The author is immature and the writing is boring. But it shows how thin the veneer of society has become. I read two chapters and then tossed it into to the woodstove so no one else would be subjected to this sick, disgusting book. Don't waste you money. Why is Amazon selling this since it is \\"distasteful, objectionable...\\"? The reviews of books can't be distasteful or objectionable but the book itself can be?
B005DNPKSQ|5.0|Ill be watching this movie over and over again, it makes me feel calm and submersed in a truely amazing plot that just cant be described with words

0316044938|4.0|It's Banned Book Week 2012! Time to discuss another banned ghost novel, The Lovely Bones by Alice Sebold.<br /><br />A true ghost book, the novel is narrated by an apparition named Suzie Salmon. It's not a mystery. You know within the first few pages the identity of Suzie's sexual predator-murderer. Rather The Lovely Bones is an examination of loved ones in crisis. Suzie becomes a kind of omniscient observer of the machinations grief wields on family dynamics-parent to parent, child to child, parent to child. Everything in Suzie's family changes, including Suzie who must come to terms both with what she observes and with her own loss.<br /><br />I actually met Alice Sebold at the Squaw Valley Writers Conference; I was fortunate to be in her workshop session. She's a lovely person, completely devoid of that upturned nose arrogance you sometimes find in successful authors.<br /><br />What some people may not understand is that, like the protagonist of The Lovely Bones, Sebold herself experienced a violent sex crime. Talk about writing what you know! She told us about her recovery journey that she first traveled while writing the nonfiction account, Lucky. It was after writing Lucky that Sebold was able to complete The Lovely Bones.<br /><br />When describing The Lovely Bones, Sebold explained it began with voice, as Suzie Salmon's voice was in Sebold's head from the beginning. You can tell, too, and the novel remains voice-rich throughout. A near perfect novel, The Lovely Bones is a moving, suspenseful (brainiac sister Lindsey stalks the murderer), even at times, comic, exploration of remembrance, recovery and rebirth.
0316228532|3.0|I bought it half price (no tax). For $18.50 I figured I would read it and pass it along to family and friends. I'm not down with all the JK hype, I just wanted a decent read, and I knew she was a good writer having consumed four HP books.<br /><br />\\"Casual\\" is easy to read fast with lots of dialogue and short sentences. (It would be a good plane read.) She really does know how to write.  The \\"but\\" is that every social issue is thrown into the blender in this one without much build to it. Another reviewer described it as a hot mess. She's taken her pen and injected it with vaccines (a disease causing agent) of all kinds, that is, all of the vices in middle Britain (and middle America).  It's like the story is full of grinches and you're wondering whether there is a Mary Lou Who to save the day.  Unlike good vs. evil though, she's constructed evil vs. evil (or slimy vs. slimmier) in a Darwinian sort of warfare. It quickly shapes up to, \\"who will win out\\". It's worth reading, but it tries too hard to do too much. It's like a smash up of Zadie Smith meets Jonathan Frazen meets Wally Lamb. Reading along it seems like I've read a similar but better, more palpable storyline before.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved Bared to You and was waiting on pins and needles for book two.  Sylvia outdid herself.  Her character development sucks you right and doesn't let you go until the last sentence.  In a word, this book was INTENSE. In the first book we learn about the attraction between Gideon and Eva, in this book we learn about their obsessions and addictions to one another.  You can't help but root for them throughout the book when they keeps running into obstacles and Gideon shuts her out by not telling her about himself.  The drama that centers around Nathan is sometimes better than the sex and believe me, there is ALOT of sex.  It's good to see Cary again and see how his life is progressing. It would be great to see all of the broken/troubled individuals get their happy ending.<br /><br />Sylvia dangles just enough of the carrot to keep loyal readers coming back for more.  Looking forward to Entwined with You and I have no doubt that it will be better than this one.  Keep them coming Sylvia!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book kept me engaged from the start. The ending left me wanting more, so I'm hoping there is a sequel. I highly recommend this book!

B007GCY8FS|5.0|If you think Lee Child can't  bring back the whole ten yards of excitment with Jack Reacher again you will be wrong!<br />From beggining to end you will get close to Reacher, laugh about his way of analizing situations or been awaiting for the next problem that he has infront of him. When you think is getting better it can just get worse.<br />You can not stop reading, highly addicted like all the series.<br />This is not a collection of books that you read one and you read all but warranty that after you read the first one you will want more of Jack Reacher!
0525953728|5.0|I don't normally read any book on this subject matter.  However, I really wanted to find out what really happened on this mission and I appreciate the fact that we were given this book as a first hand account.  It is interesting and informative.  I liked understanding why the author would chose to do something like be a SEAL and I thought the book related that backstory well.  Once I got started it was very hard to put this book down.  It is regrettable that the author has taken so much criticism on publishing his own account, but I for one really appreciate the fact that he did.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book is full of emotion and turbulence. The story takes you on quite a ride with drastic highs and lows. The reader is not just reading the words, but living them too.  The characters have real problems that will resonate with the audience.. The happily ever after is not just a given-as with real life-there is a lot of hard work involved. Thank you, Sylvia Day, for writing a saga that is passionate and engrossing.
B000001FY5|5.0|One could never say Bob Marley wasn't charismatic. By the time the 70's was drawing to it's concluding years,the music he was making with the Wailers were not only a rallying cry and inspiration to every from Stevie Wonder to The Clash but his devotion to his cause was even beginning to have the power to affect political change in his native country. However badly needed that was Marley's position as a cultural icon began to have an effect on his life,as violence and death threats loomed on a man whose stance was primarily about peace. So he did what he always did-reached out with his music to bring in a yet larger audience in some surprising ways.<br /><br />  In many ways this album found it's huge commercial success by representing reggae achieving it's most fullest flower. If that's what one is looking for \\"Natural Mystic\\",\\"So Much Things To Say\\",\\"Guiltiness\\" and \\"The Heathen\\" sure have a lot of that. Bob's recent experiencing with the continual political corruption in Jamaica  were spoken very loudly here and by the time we get to the monsterously  churning,funky title song he's yearning yet more for Rastafarian redemption yet again. On the next half there are concessions towards the more commercial.\\"Jamming\\" might be Bob's most popular and one of the poppiest reggae numbers but a great one. And one of my favorite Bob Marley tunes.<br /><br />  \\"Turn The Lights Down Low\\" add some light electronics to the sensual flavor of the tune and the albums ends with two more unforgettable Marley anthems in \\"Three Little Birds\\" (another of my favorites by Marley) and a medley of \\"One Love/People Get Ready\\".  This self produced effort had the strong effect of both remaining true to the music Bob Marley popularized but also using some contemporary production and musical elements to add extra musical seasoning to his sound. I've heard some hardcore Bob Marley fans say that they feel this album is a little too commercial for their tastes. From what I've heard I don't think Marley had anything to do with being commercial. Popular?For sure. But commercial no. And because of his willingness to expand musically to get his message across,I think albums like this actually play a good part in helping the audience understand that difference.ley had anything to do with being commercial.

B00005KB9X|5.0|While the first two Bob Marley & The Wailers full length albums [[ASIN:B00005KB9T Catch a Fire]] and [[ASIN:B00005KB9R Burnin]]' did extremely well as the first records produced with Chris Blackwell,something clicked with them around the mid 70's. With the rise of punk and funk (no irony that those two genres have rhyming names),there was a sense of a number of different people making music that was not only different but socially rebellious from the mainstream. In in native Jamaica,Marley's Rastafarian spirituality and determined political stance reflected that to a point where reggae,the music he helped innovate and champion with the help of producer Lee Scratch Perry was becoming part of this new world of what I've often called people music. And considering the fact that three key members of the Wailers,including Peter Tosh,had left before the making of this album it showcased Marley's ability to rebound all the strong from just about any changes he would deal with.<br /><br />  Hard for me to review reggae in a way since the very genre itself it defined by rhythms that don't generally change. But everything here definitely comes from two basic roots: the music of Africa and of African America. \\"Lively Up Yourself\\",\\"No Woman,No Cry\\",\\"Rebel Music\\" and the title song are all reggae and Bob Marley standards and represent an almost textbook example of the spiritual unity,Afrocentrism  and anti authoritarianism of classic reggae in every sense of the word. On other songs such as \\"Them Belly Full (But We Hungry)\\",\\"So Jah Seh\\",Bend Down Low\\",Talkin' Blues and the closing \\"Revolution\\" that message is bought even further to live by the inclusion of heavy gospel inspired organs and some slick rhythm guitar licks. All a potent reminder of how much reggae brings into it's nucleus from American soul and funk.<br /><br />  The career of Bob Marley and the Wailers would change a bit after the release of this album. During this time even American acts such as The Jackson 5 were seeking Marley out (check out their \\"It's Too Late To Change The Time\\" to see how much of an influence Bob Marley had on the group and their songwriters). At the same time this was coming out of this band very organically. Of course as time would go on,some of the trappings of fame would have personal effects on Bob Marley's life. But he never changed his spiritual convictions or the musical mission he had started earlier. His overall intention was to use his growing fame to a broader audience to spread his message. And that's why it didn't matter if reggae didn't always seem very musically diverse: the rhythms were supposed to drive their messages home with a certain force. So melodically,rhythmically and most importantly lyrically this album is one of the most important for Marley and reggae in general.seeking Marley out (check out their \\"It's Too Late To Change The Time\\" to see how much of an influence Bob Marley had on the group and their songwriters).

B005LAII6W|1.0|I'm a huge fan of the original RE games as they were revolutionary in their day while zombies just made them all the more sweeter. I had hoped that we could have got some good movies out of this concept but all hope was lost the second the production company hired that complete and utter HACK Anderson who has screwed this franchise right in the pooper. Mainly just to keep his Eurotrash wife employed. I can't believe that FIVE of these movies have been made over the last ten years and there's not a single one that I can say was any good!?! Even more amazing is that each of them have cost tens of millions and yet they STILL suck. Now, FYI, I'm not hard to please when it comes to Horror and there are DOZENS of cheesy low budget Horror sequels from the 80's that I love from various franchises (Nightmare on Elm Street, Friday the 13th, Phantasm, Hellraiser, Halloween etc....) but the one thing that the best of them have is charm which is completely lacking in every single RE movie. They're cynically stupid and even worse is that considering they're based on a series of Horror games there's no actual, you know, HORROR in them beyond whatever make-up effects and gore is splattered on the screen. No mood, atmosphere, suspense, nothing, just Anderson indulging in his delusion that people want to see a 100 pound model running around, shooting stuff and spinning in the air while he pilfers from the Matrix films and even wholesale rips off the opening of the terrible 2004 Dawn of the Dead remake.<br /><br />I wish someone would buy back the rights and put out some proper RE movies that hark back to Survival Horror which is what made them memorable in the first place while Anderson's drivel will soon be forgotten at the bottom of the cinematic landfill where the rest of his celluloid resume belongs.

You also get access to his tutorial videos online to view as many times as you want, for free...<br /><br />I bought this book when it first came out and just found it under a stack of books and remembered how much it helped me so decided to leave a feedback which is something I should've done a long time ago.

B007THA4FI|1.0|Man down<br />In little town<br />Council seat<br />Incomplete<br />Nothing more<br />What a bore<br /><br />This tedious, overstuffed, character-heavy story takes you through the machinations of finding someone to fill a vacant council seat in a little town.  After countless repetitive chapters about the lives of the unlikable characters, each stuck in their own personal imbroglio yet linked in one way or another, you may feel the need to take a break to watch the grass grow on your front lawn.<br /><br />The main problem with this book is that the most interesting character physically leaves the scene in the first chapter, and by the time you finish dragging yourself through the painful ordeal of completing the book, you'll feel that he's the luckiest one of all.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, October 2, 2012

B008966SIU|4.0|When Grizzly Bear released \\"Veckatimest\\" in 2009, the band deserved the critical and commercial breakthrough it brought them. I personally loved that album and had it in my Top 10 of Albums of the Year then. The band took to the road with that album like never before, and then took time off for various side projects (including the \\"Blue Valentine\\" soundtrack). Now a long three years later comes Grizzly Bear's 4th studio album (not counting \\"Blue Valentine\\").<br /><br />\\"Shields\\" (10 tracks; 48 min.) starts off with the acoustic guitar-heavy \\"Sleeping Ute\\" and then dives into \\"Speak In Rounds\\", which I believe is the hardest rocking track Grizzly Bear has ever done. After a 1 min. instrumental interlude, we then get \\"Yet Again\\", which yet again shows the band at its hardest rocking, wow. The album's first half closes with a pensive \\"The Hunt\\". I rate the first half of the album 4.5 stars. The second half starts off with the gently trotting \\"A Simple Answer\\", which is followed buy an abstract sounding \\"What's Wrong?\\". The songs on Side B are all quite long, and not as immediately attention-grabbing as earlier in the album. \\"Gun-Shy\\" reminded me of 1970s Steely Dan, for some reason! It all leads to the closing track, a 7 min. \\"Sun In Your Eyes\\", which feels like it could and should go epic, and then finally does. I rate the album's second half 3.5 stars.<br /><br />In all, while not as impressive as \\"Veckatimest\\", \\"Shields\\" is still a very good album, and certainly worth the long wait. I've seen the band in concert a number of times over the years, including most recently at the MidPoint Music Festival here in Cincinnati, where they headlined and brought a fantastic 80 min. set that relied heavily on songs from \\"Shields\\" (I think they all-but-one from the album), confirming once again that any song Grizzly Bear plays live, rocks much harder in concert than on the studio albums. If you have a chance to see these guys in concert, do not miss them! Meanwhile, \\"Shields\\" is highly recommended!highly recommended!
0307269981|2.0|I guess I did not realize that this book was listed as \\"acceptable\\" condition when I purchased it.  But to me, acceptable would be not written in, no torn pages, with slip cover on outside and hardcover in ok shape.  So let me say, the book that I received was written in, no slip cover on the outside, the hardcover stained and the corners bent and torn.  I will definitely be more careful when choosing my books from now on. This one even cost more than the other one in this trilogy I bought that was in better shape. It won't happen again.<br /><br />On the other hand, they did send the book out to me earlier than I thought I was going to get it.

B0085Z8F4A|1.0|Rather then write a whole review, I realized I'd already done pretty much that while replying to a shameful post glorifying this film as legitimate \\"genius\\". So out of little more then sheer laziness, I'll just copy the reply. Ridley, you made me do this! (and your inept untalented writers)<br /><br />The aged Mr. Scott has indeed lost his cool. This is one of the biggest insults he's even inflicted upon his fans, and this is coming from someone who adored him earlier in his career.<br /><br />Tragic, what this film could-have been.<br /><br />But, don't despair. The true value of this film almost completely makes up for how disappointed we are in Sir Scott, and his overwhelmingly pathetic/lazy writers. Prometheus is a brilliant barometer!<br /><br />Not until now has there been a more exceptional method for differentiating those who are easily enthused and manipulated by (stereotypical and tired) eye-candy, mediocrity (masquerading as brilliance), and generic/wooden acting/storyline/conclusions. This film is, to date, the single best film for accessing the stylistic ignorance or awareness of anyone you have questions about.<br /><br />Does it mean anyone who likes this film is an idiot? Of course not. That, is the pitfall of anyone who is hyper-enthusiastic, yet ignorant, when damning anyone who doesn't share his/her highly biased views.<br /><br />Which again, is why I LOVE this film. It clearly separates those who, until now, had only a thin veil between them, to most observers, at least. Seeing the difference between a full-blown dullard, and someone who isn't, is simple. Do people really think that takes a keen eye? But this film helps identify less easily-discernible types. Those being:<br /><br />A: Those who are fairly aware, fairly intelligent, yet stylistically sheeplike and prone to eating what they are fed, adore overly melodramatic music telling them how to feel at any given moment, and who invariably pat themselves on the back when not-so-cleverly hidden clues, foreshadowing, or subplot devices (which completely baffle the truly ignorant) arise. Oh the joy they feel!<br /><br />B: Those who aren't so easily overjoyed by mediocrity, (Especially when it comes from directors who not only lack mediocrity, but who literally changed the overall environment of cinema earlier in their careers), like to stay as aware as their craniums will allow, and understand that there are many levels above them on the ladder of art/wisdom/intellect/awareness/empathy/principles, and they aren't even remotely that high up. (buffoons usually think they are pretty high on that hypothetical ladder, bless their hearts)<br /><br />Type A and B, usually, are harder to tell apart. At least, prior to being invited to their homes and seeing what their Kmart-inspired ideas of \\"art\\" really are.<br /><br />[said a previous reviewer who loved it]<br /><br />\\"Charlize Theron plays the ice-cold bitch perfectly\\"<br /><br />Sure, if by \\"perfectly\\" you mean laughably stereotypical and villainous on the level of a Disney film. If she had a mustache, she certainly would have been twirling it. Charlize phoned-in that silly over-the-top performance, yet this person applauds it? What does this say? Quite a bit, actually. This film didn't have characters, it had caricatures and stereotypes. Didn't notice it? Then sadly, you might be part of group A. But hey, don't hate the messenger. The truth is a bitter-tasting and nasty pill. Who likes medicine? Not me! But, I'll take it every day of the week rather then the sweet sweet candy of ignorance, the delicious flavors of conformity, and the beautiful tones from the flute of complacency.<br />(Group A members, can leave it anytime they want, BTW.)<br /><br />[and again from the same reviewer]<br /><br />\\"In closing, \\"Prometheus\\" is a genius piece of science fiction art\\"<br /><br />(Yikes! This is unintentional comedy, I am sorry to say. Once again I implore you all to use this film as the perfect barometer which Istrongly suspect it is.)<br /><br />Well in my own closing, I say, learn to recognize the signs. There are plenty more quotes I could use from the previous review, but why? This film, and this individuals review, teaches many lessons FAR more important then simply reviewing a current film. But, to get back to the point of a film review, this film is childish, lazy, pathetic, generic, and much much MUCH more. Unlike nearly all of his films from his better days, I couldn't even watch it twice, though I tried.<br /><br />Don't be so manipulated, kiddies. It's easy, I know, \\"Path of least resistance, blah blah blah\\", and all that. But take away a valuable lesson from this persons review, which is simply: enthusiasm and awareness don't play very well together. Don't be sheep, be people. Appreciate true genius. There is nothing more unfortunate then when someone calls the utterly mundane, \\"genius\\".<br /><br />It hurts to admit Ridley has lost it, but his last several films suggested as much, and now this one shouts it loudly. And those writers? Oh geeze. Deus ex machina's ALL OVER the damn place. I especially love the Lucas-esque past, which is MORE advanced then the future? Well done, lads! Wouldn't a less-is-more, lower-tech, gritty approach have benefited this film better, while adding an addition layer of legitimacy within the world which Ridley himself created? Nope.<br /><br />And dear super-motivated reviewer, I don't know exactly how many times a term as extreme as \\"genius\\" could be applied to a film, it certainly hasn't happened too damn much, and even less lately. You diminish the term by using it on this mass-appeal, CGI-fest, forgettable prequel. Save your massive enthusiasm for a film which deserves it, instead of one which panders to the lemmings.<br /><br />Now get out there people, and use the barometer! It works!<br /><br />[and motivated by the reviewers glowing and astonishing praise of how legendary and timeless the \\"squid\\" scene was going to be]<br /><br />(I just can't help myself:  No, the baby-squid-stupidity doesn't even barely come close to rivaling anything, much less the original chest-burster scene.

B008G12ERC|5.0|For anyone who is counting, that means I would consider all of their albums other than their first (which is still very good) to be 5 star masterpieces.  Yes, Muse sounds quite different here, but they evolve as all great bands do and have been changing pretty drastically since Black Holes and Revelations in 2006.  If you want the fuzz bass driven, guitar pyrotechnics of old, just listen to Origin of Symmetry or Absolution.<br /><br />The songs on 2nd Law are extremely varied and the first half in particular is pretty much flawless.<br /><br />The opening Supremacy merges Led Zeppelin and James Bond in a way that only Muse would conceive.  Sounds fresh but still very Musey.<br /><br />First proper single Madness has a great Electro Soul vibe with some of Matt's most heartfelt lyrics.  It is a surprise to hear him be so personal on an album, and not just talk about aliens and conspiracies.<br /><br />Panic Station is definitely the catchiest song on the album, with its unholy mix of INXS, Queen and even Michael Jackson.  Plus the horn players from Stevie Wonder's Superstition show up.<br /><br />Prelude/Survival is Muse on crack, and this from a band that I used to call Radiohead on crack.  Of course, most of the Radiohead comparisons disappeared a long time ago, as this is full blown operatic Muse.  Obviously Queen-like.  This was the early promotional single tied to the Olympics and made some think Muse had completely lost their minds, but it works on the album very well.<br /><br />Follow Me is one of the dreaded dub step songs that people were so worried about.  Not only that, it is a heartfelt dub step rock anthem about his son.  Surprisingly works.<br /><br />Animals does have a Radiohead sound, with the minor key chords that that other English band employs so well.  The solo and end of the song are all Muse.  Brilliant.<br /><br />Explorers is a little too meandering and is the first time on the album that the quality dips at all.<br /><br />Big Freeze is verymuch akin to a U2 anthem, and as a result many Muse fans hate it.  I like U2 so I like it.<br /><br />The next songs are sung and written by bassist Chris, and not sure they really fit.  Save Me is simply too ballad like for Muse (sounds like Doves), and while Liquid State has a nasty guitar riff I would like on many albums, it still doesn't fit Muse.<br /><br />The last two tracks (both titled The 2nd Law) are dub step influenced instrumentals with news reel voiceovers.  The first, subtitled Unsustainable, is driven by loud guitars and offsetting techno flourishes.  The second, subtitled Isolated Systems, is piano driven and musically complex and brilliant.<br /><br />Overall, this is definitely a five star album, even if I personally feel the quality dips a little on tracks 7 through 10, but these are still good songs as well.
B009B2U73I|2.0|I don't know why krall is doing it to herself.Why can't she stay with her beautiful style that her fans love.She waited 3 years since \\"Quiet Nights\\" to come  back to another \\"strange\\" Cd.
B007CKNX28|5.0|I am so happy that Jack White is back.  Yes, the Raconteurs and Dead Weather projects were fun, but just does not stand up to the entirely Jack controlled albums. Yes, I know Meg had veto power in the The White Stripes, but otherwise they were pretty much Jack White solo albums.<br /><br />The highlights on this album are numerous:<br /><br />- The re-imaging of Dead Leaves and the Dirty Ground on Missing Pieces, albeit with Rhodes Piano<br />- The nasty, raging Sixteen Saltines, where the venom makes up for any musical simplicity<br />- The pseudo rap of Freedom at 21<br />- The re-imaging of Son of a Preacher Man on Love Interrupted<br />- The wordplay of Hypocritical Kiss, where I can't tell when Jack is taking about others or himself.  Makes sense given the title<br />- The borderline epic piano-driven Weep Themselves to Sleep<br />- The full blown voodoo blues of I'm Shakin<br />- The $&@! off attitude toward Meg on Hip Eponymous Poor Boy<br /><br />While the album is often piano driven (and what wonderful piano it is), this album easily rivals Elephant.  Essential 2012 album.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|I'm enjoying this game very much.  The puzzles range from brain relaxingly easy to a little more challenging.  However I am getting pretty frustrated with the robot puzzle. No problem with download which is important to me as I live in the sticks.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|got the app a while ago but after a couple months stopped working and I uninstalled it. then tried to reinstall and I typed in the location but it wouldn't load.I would not reccomend this app.
B0072GPQ72|4.0|it is a alright movie, even though i was some what disappointed. I was worried about to much violence against animals. There was some, but for a war movie it was controlled. The story line wandered a bit.
B005K17RU0|5.0|The first weather app I got for my kindle fire was the Weather Channel one, but it pales in comparison to AccuWeather. Accuweather has a better interface and is more responsonsive. I like the radar feature on accuweather better as well. Also it doesn't run in the background when you're done with it, so it uses less processing power. Overall I am very satisfied with this app.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|This one kept my attention more than the second one. More to the plot with interaction from the other characters. Sex scenes were still basically the same with same word content which to me became very boring in the second book. For the hype that these books received I expected more, and would recommend borrowing the books before buying them. Make sure it's something you would want to add to your collection.
0525953728|4.0|This is a truly well written book. It was great that the book wasn't just about the Osama raid. Owens explains the training and the type of strategies that the SEAL's use by going through missions since 9/11. He also delves into the history of American Special Forces. So by the end of the book when the raid begins I felt completely emersed in the moment, I felt like I was on the ground. It's also truly inspirational, I highly recommend this book.
B0070XFNDE|5.0|Love the book. Just as good as Shadow of the wind. I enjoyed it all the way and the caraters are just as I remembered it
B00785P2QC|4.0|good game but slightly lacking in that it keeps giving challenges for things you don't have access to yet. challenges should coorespond to your place in the game play. otherwise fun time waster for those that like city games.
0525953728|5.0|Seeing that there are 1851 reviews already published it is doubtful I will add anything about  this great book that hasn't been said already.  I could not do what Matt did physically,  mentally, or emotionally, but I - - and every American citizen - - am forever indebted to him for his courage and patriotism, and thank G-d that there are those like him who are willing to sacrifice everything  so that we may live free.
B008QE9VJI|5.0|People are taking this movie way too seriously. Everybody needs to watch this movie as it's meant to be watched. It's sheer entertainment. It's more of a homage to the TV series ( which was really bad. You can see booms and cameras in shots, actors would bump their heads in doorways, they'd forget their lines, etc.). LIGHTEN UP!!
B004DLPXAO|4.0|Originally got this for my knock-off IPad (called YourPad) and it worked fine for a while, then got glitchy and wouldn't open the book.  Tried removing & reinstalling, however that didn't work.  Got out the CHEAPER knock-off (iBridge), installed Kindle for Android and it has worked PERFECTLY ever since (knock on wood).  I love that I can take my current reading material ANYWHERE and read while I'm waiting at the Drs office or whereever.  Not my favorite app, but probably the most used one.
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|I dont have enough words to describe how AWESOME this item is. If youre a diehard Walking Dead fan, you absolutely MUST own this. This zombie head sitting on my display shelf in my living room is an immediate conversation starter, and the blu ray features are great to begin with.
B005RUUUAI|3.0|I have to say that the editing for these seemed a bit choppy. I was also upset with the length, they average around 32 min. which is below an average show length of 44 min. I do not think they will be running a season 3 on this franchise. I had a feeling they were punching the clock with writing and production values. The lower writing standard was evident in the cursory exploration of societal and community issues. The whole abortion timeline could have been a lot more controversial. The issues of security within a community and the para militarization of the police or loss of freedom as a result were topical at best. The writing just didn't help provoke thoughtful introspection.
B000VM9Z8K|4.0|I loved this book!  I find it so hard to find \\"chick-lit\\" that isn't whiny and boring. This was such a fun book! I wish there were more like this.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Simply put, this sharpener works. And whats great about this one is that its compact and fits easily with most gear. If you want a simple, compact, and sharpener for field use, this is it!
B0090P98Z4|5.0|very fun to play. looks nice too. earn in game money through achievements. easy controls. levels aren't too long making it a good break type game. can turn off sounds which can be loud.
B008M9PHWM|5.0|This is good stuff! I've been a Dylan fan since the beginning....yes, I'm that old....but one big difference from the Dylan of the sixties and the Dylan of today is the voice...it's SHOT! So, although I love the songs on this new album, and I love the melodies, and I can understand most of the lyrics, I feel I'm missing a lot of what's going on because I can't understand ALL of the lyrics.<br /><br />It would have been nice if a lyric sheet would have been included. I purchased both the vinyl edition and the CD edition. A lyric sheet with the CD might have been tough but it would have been easy with the vinyl.<br /><br />But still, a damned good album nevertheless!
B005J2UM9S|3.0|I heard about this movie about a month ago and finally found it and was glad I did. I love scary movies so I had to see this. It was a little predictable moreover it was not one that I could not watch alone in the dark, cause I did and had no problem with it. I would give it more stars if I had to watch it with the hubby.<br /><br />It is a great rental not a owner though.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Fantastic.  In a way, I have always thought that the best parts of super hero movies are the origins of the character.  In this film you get, if not complete origins, numerous little origin-like vignettes for each member of the Avengers.  The plot is not particularly complex but it turns out to be a great action adventure.  Better than all of the individual movies that were made about the particular members of the avengers, including original Iron Man, which was pretty good.<br /><br />Now, if there is anyone out there who knows who cut Tony Stark's blazer that looked like it was made out of windbreaker material, with a zipper on the collar and over the pockets, please add a comment to this review.  That was the coolest garment ever in a super hero movie.  I realize that most people were not looking at the clothes Tony Stark(Robert Downey JR) was wearing but that leaped off the screen and into my consciousness.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I have read all of Lee Child Jack Reacher books, and have been very pleased about the story, how Lee pays attention to detail. I am always satisfied after reading a Jack Reacher story.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I really like what this app has to offer. I enjoy seeing everyone's cool pictures. I always love posting stuff.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|A quick read, very personal and fast paced. The timing of delivery was good--the day it came out, I got mine instantly.
B001O6W9QC|5.0|Ben Stiller, Jack Black and Robert Downey how can you go wrong?  Very funny movie. If you can't laugh at this story line you must be dead.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|The journey is more intense than the last book.  Couldn't put this book down! The ups and downs had me at the edge of me seat.  I love them and I can't wait to see what book 3 brings.  Hopefully not as much drama and a happy ending :)  Great book Sylvia!
B008ER9QLK|4.0|I just received my Blu ray set of this Ring cycle and saw that the box set included the excellent \\"Wagner's Dream\\" documentary!!  The Amazon site does NOT make this clear.<br /><br />So, an extra bonus for the money.  Well done.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|great book soo far i hope that annabeth doenst die at the end  spoiler alert  hazel has crush on leo
B008OTTRXU|3.0|The four extra tracks on the deluxe edition (Drive, Wrong Feels So Right, Sweetie, and I Know You Have a Girlfriend) are great songs that should have been on the album in the first place! If not for those songs this album gets two stars. I tried so hard to like this album; I own both versions of the album and have listened to them many times but I only like a few songs. Carly is very very talented at singing and I truly believe in her and I think this was a good step forward in her young music career. Moveover, I do hope she doesn't fall for the 'pop' style forever,I think she should keep trying new kinds of music to express her feelings. I much prefer her amazing work on her first album \\"Tug of War\\" (released in 2008) which is way more creative and memorable than \\"Kiss\\".<br /><br />Track by Track (w/ extra songs)<br /><br />1.)Tiny Little Bows - Not a bad song it's just good enough. 5/10<br />2.)This Kiss - Great pop song with a little heat! 9/10<br />3.)Call Me Maybe - Oh no it's this song .....no comment 1/10 (Disclaimer: the cookie monster's version is better =D *Wink*)<br />4.)Curiosity - ok here we go I nice original pop song 8/10<br />5.)Good Time (with Owl City)- Great summer song!! 10/10<br />6.)More Than a Memory - For me here is were it goes down hill 6-9 11-12 - generic as heck 3/10<br />7.)Turn Me Up - Well, this song is horrifyingly terrible to be kind 0/10<br />8.)Hurt So Good - a pop song....do I need to say more? 4/10<br />9.)Beautiful (with Justin Bieber)- I like it 6/10<br />10.)Tonight I'm Getting Over You - Powerful song I ownly song that is memorable!  above 10/10<br />11.)Guitar String / Wedding Ring - Carly let Taylor Swift sing this not you! 1/10<br />12.)Your Heart Is a Muscle\\" -  This song is just weird 0/10<br /><br />Extra Bonus Tracks<br />13.) Drive - Buy is Song! - Above 10/10<br />14.) Wrong Feels so Right - 10/10<br />15.) Sweetie - Cute Song Loving it! Above 10/10<br />16.) I Know You Have a Girlfriend - Good Song overall.7.5/10
B00114RKT8|5.0|One of the best historical dramas of all time.  The actors, time depection and story are the best I have ever seen.  I think the title may be confused with low budget, sweet stories of love and romance.  But this is based on HISTORY and how through the faith of one man the save trade in Great Britan was peacfully ended. The United States had the Civil War.  There are so many values and lessons in the film that I find myself watching it over and over again.  This is real history and real heros.  You don't see this on your typical movies.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved this book, i have to read the next one right away. i may have to start the series again
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|Was OK, reminds me of the old movie Logan's run. Could have been better. At least they have a chance to improve with a sequel.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|this book was the best book ever!! i love the hunger games its so good!!! :) i fell in love with this book! you HAVE to read the series!!!!!!!! :D
B006LSZECO|3.0|I've read about 3/4 of the book.  I continue to read, but I find the book quite depressing.  I don't think there is a happy thought in the entire book.  It drags on and on, but I keep thinking it is going to hook me, until I can't stop reading.  Not yet.  It has it's moments, but when \\"who took Amy\\" finally is revealed, I had already had the same idea.  I will finish it, of course,  and may have to re-write this review but thinking not.
B009B50QOU|5.0|As a life long Green Day fan this album takes me back to the Dookie/Insomniac days.  I can't wait for Dos!
0807014273|5.0|Despite being an inmate in a Nazi death camp, Frankl realizes meaning in his life. He also invents the theory of logotherapy, an existentialist analysis/psychotherapy based upon finding meaning in one'(tm)s life. I recommend this book to anyone who feels that life has dealt them a bad hand or anyone interested in finding their place in the universe.
B00999VI0Y|1.0|I strongly suggest not buying this item. Once I plugged it into my iHome the item worked, but the volume barely gets loud enough for me to hear anything coming through my iHome. My iPhone speakers play louder music then what is transmitted. Very disappointed.
B006VGGAC4|5.0|almost every person who rated this book 1 star did not actually read the book. they dont like that he had an affair and decided to judge this book on the fact without reading a single word. thats really not fair so having not read the entire book yet im going to also make a review without reading the book to balance this out. (i read a few chaps so far and enjoyed every page so far) dont judge a book on what you heard about arnold from the media..
B003B5M0PO|5.0|Loved it, Loved it, Loved it. What more can I say. You may need the tissues close by though - Enjoy!
0385343175|5.0|I love all of Danielle Steels books and this one is just a good as all the rest of her books.  I think you will enjoy this one and it's a nice book to add to your collection.  When I finish reading these books I send them to my Grand Daughter and when she is done she sends them to her Mom. so you know they must be good books.
B0098VYCCE|2.0|If you are going to redo a redone.. Do it right. While the Queen was pretty evil, everyone else was so so. Even the effects got watered down by the dry acting. Can we do a another princess please? Maybe a Mandarin, Botswanian,  or even of Punjabi origin.  The Euro thing is getting mundane for even Hollywood. Yawn. Stretch.
B0083GQKQG|1.0|Dark movie without much of a point, message or conclusion. Loose ends. Skips around too much. Waste of my time.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I must admit....I started reading reflected in you and was glad it picked up right where bared to you left off....but I was a bit \\"not impressed\\" for about the first five pages......and them BAM, I was hooked! It took all of about 7 hours and I had read it cover to cover..if Anyone has ever read my reviews before or knows me personally, I used to hate to read! Well, if I continue to read books like this....I guess I will become the next \\"bookworm!\\" Eva and Gideon are just as yummy, sensual, broken, screwed up, etc as in BTY, but at a more intense level! On every page, I was either getting frustrated with him or her....and yet, I was constantly on the edge of my seat hoping they would find their way through all of the heartache and the twists and turns that seem to want to pull them apart! It was good finding out more about the good Dr Terry (pun intended)....great to see Eva become more feisty and put a lot of the people \\"in their place!\\"<br />Now we get to wait....yet again....to see where this story takes us....but as I said before (in every review!)....there better be a HEA!!!<br />Enjoyed Reflected very much.....great must read!
B003EI2EH2|5.0|Book had a lot of good info and provides good plans. Wish the parts were a little more clear sometimes ie do x, y, and z to lose weight but overall loved it!
B005K17RU0|5.0|great app. works awesome.  love how accurate it is and up to the minute updates.  i can deal with the ads dont want to pay 2.99
B0091REZMW|4.0|this game is lots of fun.  good graphics. I would recommend this game.  addicting but annoying to rate so early in play.
B004G5ZY7E|3.0|Surprisingly good writing, lots of intelligent comments, characters reasonably well defined, although the plot often seems a bit strange, designed to be filmed. This is the first book by the author I've written, I've liked the previews Amazon sends, I'll read the others.<br />But I must say, Harry Hole as a name for a character is really asking for snide comments. Perhaps in Norwegian it doesn't sound quite so bad...
B008XX6J4C|5.0|First, for those who have never listened to The Piano Guys or seen their videos, imagine a mix of Pop/Rock, New Age, and Classical music. Most of the music they play has an accompanying video that adds to the feel and atmosphere of each song in a way only 5 guys from Utah have been able to do. All their music is meant to be positive, uplifting, beautiful, and above all, family friendly. Fans of The Piano Guys span all age groups and are found in all corners of the world. If you are looking for something with passion that won't overwhelm the senses like so much media today, look no further than The Piano Guys.<br />This album comes shortly after The Piano Guys signed with Sony Masterworks. If you have heard or own their first album under their own label, then you will recognize a few of the songs on this new album, but they are welcome additions to a very well rounded track list. Not a single song feels out of place or \\"forgotten\\". The two previously unreleased songs: Titanium/Pavane and Arwen's Vigil, don't disappoint. Vigil starts soft and romantic like the title suggests, and then picks up momentum about half-way through and finishes again on a slow note. For fans of the movies, the song reflects the various ups and downs of the fantastic story in fine style. Titanium/Pavane was heard once before this release during the taping of their PBS special in mid September and the quality of the performance is certainly heard in both versions. It's obvious why this song is said to be The Piano Guys' favorite. This is the second time David Guetta was covered by The Piano Guys and I hope they plan on using more of that style of music because it translates so well onto classical instruments (with the flair that The Piano Guys are famous for). A video should, hopefully, follow the album release closely and, as always, The Piano Guys experience is not complete without the videos to go with the songs. So, if you haven't seen their youtube page, go to: [...] and check out all the great videos available. And subscribe to The Piano Guys for all their future releases.great videos available.

B000024YDV|5.0|This album is very good, featuring amazing guitar arrangement! the bass is very audible and the drum is tight and precise with a natural and fresh sound. To me is one of Satriani's best for sure! i've heard of Crystal Planet in 1999, but it didn't matter to me because i was more into heavy/thrash metal only (i still love them) and i didn't even knew who Joe Satriani was. But a couple of years later someone brought me a bunch of mp3 files and one of the folders contained Crystal Planet and decided to give it a try..then i give it another try, and another over and over again, and definitively a was kind of in love, impresed and haunted with this album, it totally blowed my mind and senses away, the melody, the riffs, the soloing, the groove, the speed, everything! Not a single weak moment in this cd, the music flows throughout the cd and you never get tired or bored.<br /><br />I couldn't afford a cd n 1999 - 2000 so i posponed this purchase for years and as the times passes by, the musical priority changes a bit too, but never forget the music of this incredible artist and this particular cd.<br /><br />Crystal Planet was a goal to me and i was commited to get a copy sooner or later, no mp3, so, finally put a CP cd in the cart and checked out. Once it arrives i sat down, and totally relaxed i began to hear this masterpiece again and the sensations and emotions or feelings, whatever, where exactly the same, like those felt more than a decade ago.<br /><br />Conclusion, let the music be part of yourself and buy this album. Totally recomended!
B005RUUUAI|5.0|This show is so great because it is about the way the cast lives their lives around the zombies, not just about the zombies..Can't wait for october 14 on AMC.
B0092SPYQG|5.0|P-Roach's best album since Getting Away With Murder. You can feel every emotion and pain in the lyrics and Shaddix' vocals. It's been awhile since I've loved a P-roach album as much as this one. As far as I remember, Won't let up and Not that beautiful are my faves. Keep on rockin', guys!!
B008JEJPSC|3.0|Ugh.<br /><br />So the only good things I can say about the Blu-Ray version of \\"Annie\\" is that it's widescreen and has better picture quality than the previous version of the DVD, and it's not expensive.<br /><br />I bought this one because our daughter loves the movie, but the DVD version looks so bad on a HD HDMI TV. The DVD picture is god-awful really.<br /><br />I was hoping the Blu-Ray would solve that. Well it doesn't really. While the video is now 16:9, the quality is just still not up to Blu-Ray standards. You know when you've gotten a classic, and they go back to the film and remaster it and it looks awesome on Blu-Ray? Well they didn't do that here. But to be fair it is much, much better than the DVD version.<br /><br />And for a \\"30th Anniversary Edition!\\" they added 2 things- \\"Sing-Along with Annie\\" which consists of, you guessed it, the portion of the movie with the song with subtitles. Lame. And the Ultraviolet version.<br /><br />Other than that, you still get the Aileen Quinn look-back from the regular DVD, as well as the laughably terrible \\"Hard-Knock Life\\" remake by \\"Play\\". Terrible.<br /><br />So, if you want widescreen and better picture quality, then buy it, but if you're expecting the stops pulled out, especially in light of the Broadway revival, don't.
B003O86FMW|4.0|If you enjoyed the first book of this series you will likely enjoy this also. Principal characters in the previous book show up here and continue to be developed with a few twists and turns along the way. One tends to be less surprised by the turns of events here although the precise ways in which they occur may not be anticipated. Still a recommended book for those liking this genre.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this is a really good app. the buttons are easy to press and are big. the display is nice too.
0345803485|1.0|I wasted hours reading this piece of dreck waiting for the 'aha moment'. That moment when you discover there is a reason some publisher thought it was worth killing trees for. It never came.  \\"50 Shades...\\" is pretty much a bunch of poorly written sex scenes with a plot to tie them together. My \\"inner goddess\\" rolled her eyes so many times they're stuck in \\"roll\\" mode. She's going to need surgery to make them stop. One other major problem, now that I've read it, it's in my brain, forever.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved it! It was so great with all of the fighting  and action that made it awesome! The Hunger Games Rocks.
B004LWZW6K|1.0|A very strange movie, it claims to be a comedy but it has the patchwork feel of something made by a committee who couldn't agree on anything.  Some of the scenes are shot and edited like a frenzied music video; some scenes are dead slow with few edits looking like castoffs they didn't know how to fit in.  Either they didn't know what they wanted to achieve in the first place, or the filmmakers were so inept that this was the best they could come up with.  It's scattershot to say the least; with humor ranging from lame to massive displays of appallingly bad taste (the decapitation of a child for laughs).  Most of it just felt sleazy and desperate, the work of puerile minds.  Things only got worse once David Hasselhoff showed up and just wouldn't go away (I thought he'd never leave).  As a Jaws spoof, this was a subpar retread offering nothing new.  As a sequel to Piranha 3D, it failed on every level.  If they were hoping to start a franchise, they definitely picked the wrong team to helm the second in what looks like a very short series.<br /><br />There's no way I'd ever want to watch this movie again; not a keeper.

B002BD9DTS|5.0|I didn't know what to expect from this seller,but rest assure, the product along with the shipping package was excellent. To also top this off, Shaolin Soccer on bluray easily exceeded my expectation in the video transfer, and the sound was about the same compared to DVD...I'm looking foward to buy again with this seller in the future...Thankyou!

B005CFWKY2|4.0|Crocs are the only footwear in which I'm totally comfortable and without pain. But there are only a limited number of styles I can wear. Patricia NOT Patricia II. The Carliana are great but the heeel is not as high as I had hoped. Similar fit to the Patricia with a slightly more refined look.

159420411X|5.0|Modernly, there seems to be two schools of thought,those who dismiss prediction and data driven analysis and those who embrace it. In this book Nate Silver bridges that divide. He illustrates the power of prediction, but also the importance of the human element. A great book for anyone who wants to understand more about the World, about statistics, about prediction, and about themselves.
B00899E5B4|5.0|I've always loved the dry wit Joe Walsh displays on stage, in life, and in his music. This musical effort eclipses everything he's done to this point, though. I defy anyone to listen to \\"One Day at a Time\\" and not profoundly respect the man that Joe Walsh is today. He's hardly an ordinary average guy.<br /><br />Love the Jeff Lynne pressence as well.<br /><br />From this digital guy, my hat's off to you, Joe![[ASIN:B008DZF874 Road Trip]]
B00866JL96|4.0|Too bad Zac doesn't smile more.  He's got that sultry, smoldering look that makes the heart melt and his acting is pretty good.  I thought the chemistry between the main couple was decent but could have been better.  That sort of sums up the movie.  It was good but could have been better.
B001RLJ26Y|2.0|This series sounded similar to X-Files so I've been giving it a try. The core characters have decent chemistry and are enjoyable but the science and story lines are not believable even for scifi (unless you are 17 years old).  Oh amazing, the Dr. found another cure in 8 hours... I am often bored to death as each episode unfolds hoping it will eventually grab me. I have 5 more to watch to finish the first season.  Is it worth my time?  We will see how disparate I get.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|*authors note this is for the one disc dvd version of this movie*<br />hello all<br /> i have been a marvel fan for a long time and this movie is the reason why. This movie proves that superhero team up are possible and when you got the right crew, are incredible. This movie is the movie DC comics wish it could make with superman(although the dark knight series comes close) if they make a justice league movie they need to get the entire phase one line up including this movie and make every director, actor, and crew men watch them all to know how a incredible movie should be made. first of we get the hulk all of the marvel fans especially fans o the incredible hulk have been wanting or soooooooooo long. Mark ruffalo does and excellent job of portraying the hulk as he should be a doctor trying to help people as payment for what the other guy does. He truly shines in this movie.<br /><br />The rest of the avengers also are incredible and take the characters that they portrayed in the other phase one movies and with joss whedon's help make them more incredible. however there is one minor gripe. And that comes from hawkeye played by Jeremy Renner. I believe he should have been also given a little more background in the movie and if allowed too would have also shines as well. But this is a minor gripe. This movie is one of those once in a generation movies that will be remembered and i can not wait for the next round of movies. Still this is a movie that should be seen by all and while there was not much in the way of extras on this dvd version the assembling the ultimate team feature was a nice little add on and i liked it alot. SO if you are movie fan get this movie, if you are a comic fan you should have already own this movie and if you are a Avengers fan you should preorder this movie or buy it as soon as you can.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I enjoyed this book. It is a continuation of the first which I really enjoyed. I am going to get the third one. This book has opened a door to a different life for me. While it is mild when compared to things I have recently discovered, it has shed light on a different culture. I have never been into romance novels so I don't know if this is considered one of those.  It has directly affected my responses to sensations that I had been unaware of.  I must admit that I really enjoyed it on the kindle because I did not feel anyone could tell what I was reading and I was able to read other books at the same time giving me the ability to disclose this reading to whom I chose while being able to claim reading a more vanilla, (acceptable) book to my more critical friends.  Guess I like my privacy.

B000KX0IOA|4.0|The film begins in the early part of the 20th century, when Mohandas K. Gandhi (Ben Kingsley), a British-trained lawyer, forsakes all worldly possessions to take up the cause of Indian independence. Faced with armed resistance from the British government, Gandhi adopts a policy of \\"passive resistance,\\" endeavoring to win freedom for his people. He attempts to do this without resorting to bloodshed and violence. In the horrendous \\"slaughter\\" sequence, more gore and blood and just altogether repulsiveness than Ive seen in any other film. Though Gandhi is long, more than three hours long it is full of scenes that caught my emotions by surprise. Among them are the entertaining part in which Gandhi is booted out of his first-class railroad seat in South Africa, a suddenly angry encounter with his wife when she refuses to clean the toilets at an ashram, and a scene in which Gandhi exposes himself in the beauty of Margaret Bourke. Also a part that moved me is an early scene in South Africa when Gandhi, long before he adopted the loincloth as his only dress, beams proudly at his small, perfectly dressed sons. \\"I'm so proud of them,\\" he says. \\"Perfect little English gentlemen.\\" Of overall importance is the possibility that the film will bring Gandhi to the attention of a lot of people including me around the world for the first time, not as a saint but as a self-searching, sometimes fallible human like anyone else and that he had a sense of humor as well as a sense of history. Gandhi won eight Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Actor, and Best Director you know it had to be good.
0307592731|5.0|I am not a hiker or a very 'outdoorsy' person but I still enjoyed this book A LOT!  It's funny and sad and just a great story especially since it's all true!  The author's hardscrabble upbringing is reminiscent of the authors of 'blood, bones, and butter' and \\"the glass castle'.  if you liked those books, you will also like ''wild'.  ms. strayed is a wonderful writer - her descriptions of carrying her monster backpack will have you also aching and rubbing your shoulders.  i read part of this book while getting a pedicure and a reflexology massage - quite interesting since i was reading about the state of her ruined feet at the time...i also enjoyed her joyful reverie of getting off the trail and treating herself to food such as cheeseburgers, chips,  and snapple...you can just imagine how it felt to eat that stuff after days of nuts, freeze dried packets, and energy bars.  In some ways this book was sort of one long 'just do it' commercial - but not in an annoying way.<br />it was also amazing to think about her financial situation as she did this hike - she literally had NOTHING but what was on her back and a few relief packages along the way containing a pittance of $20 and some socks and some hiker food.<br />i almost didn't read 'wild' because it's an oprah book and i find most of her picks just not my taste.  i am so glad i chose to spend some time on the trail with ms. strayed...she did not leave me annoyed the way the author of 'eat pray love' did...

B00408MS5S|5.0|Listen to it all the time since 1980. Never get sick of it. Great in concert too. Wish they could get back together just one more time for the road. Roger included.
0440246008|1.0|If you have never read anything about Jack Reacher, you might like this book. I had read them all prior to \\"The Hard Way\\" and would have read it just to keep pace. This book ranks right up there with The Gold Coast by Nelson Demille. Boring! You keep reading and reading waiting for the action to begin and it never happens. The last 50 pages are indicative of the way Lee Child usually writes but getting there is agonizing slow. Skip this one and read all the rest. You will have missed nothing.
B008PNBU30|5.0|Three Days Grace is one top favorite bands and every album has been great.. I almost gave this 4 stars but since I'm a fan 5 felt right. It's really different from the other albums which was a curveball to me. I give these guys props for creating a very diverse cd with alot of musical changes. As always the lyrics are great but I guess One-X is still stuck on me out of all their releases. In time this album will grow on me. You can't go wrong with Three Days Grace. I'm not great at reviews so check the album out and hear it for yourself. 3DG!!
B002DW92SE|3.0|I love Nick Hornby books! But this one is just fine... the melancholic tone, from beginning to end didn't help, is as if everyone is living a life they rate.<br />And I specially didn't like the ending. Maybe because I prefer endings that end, I don't like the insinuations and the thoughts that you have to figure out for yourself what really happened.<br />Anyway, definitely not one of my favorites, Nick. But I am looking forward for the next one.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|After reading Bared To You, I fell in love with Gideon and Eva and became a HUGE fan of Sylvia Day. I could not wait for Reflected In You and I was so not disappointed!! This is such an AWESOME book and it might even be my favorite of the two so far and that is saying something because I have some mad crazy love for Bared To You!! After finishing Reflected In You, all I want to do is go back and reread the series. I am not ready to leave Gideon and Eva. I just can't get enough of them and December is way to long of a wait to get my fix!! LOL ;)<br />Reflected In You definitely has a place in my keeper pile.<br /><br />This book wore me out!! I was emotionally spent after reading. I had forgot not only what a messed-up relationship Eva and Gideon had, but also how much baggage weighed each of them down. They were just such lovable damaged characters that my heart ached reading this story. It was hard to read them struggle to hold on to each other while battling their insecurities. I just wanted to shake them and then hug them!! LOL<br /><br />\\"But here I was, constantly awed by the gorgeousness of the complicated, frustrating, messed-up, sexy-as-sin man I was falling deeper in love with every day.\\"<br /><br />\\"You hit me the instant I saw you,\\" he said gruffly. \\"I couldn't look away. I wanted you immediately. Excessively. Almost violently.\\"<br /><br />\\"Looking at you for the first time made me think about sex. Screaming, sheet clawing sex.\\" (Eva to Gideon)<br /><br />\\"I saw that.\\" His hands slid up either side of my spine. \\"And I knew you saw me, too. Saw what I am...what I have inside me. You saw right through me.\\" (Gideon to Eva)<br /><br />\\"No one's ever seen before, Eva. You're the only one.\\"<br /><br />\\"The simple fact was, Gideon and I were the best and worst things that had ever happened to each other.\\"<br /><br />Both Eva and Gideon had some scenes that surprised me and left me talking to my Kindle. This was when my heart ached the most and I wanted to just shake them because if they would have just opened up to each other, especially Gideon, and trusted each other, these things could have been avoided. But I guess that really is the whole basis of Reflected In You. Gideon and Eva struggling to trust each other with their secrets and insecurities to build a stronger healthier relationship. I loved how Eva stood up for Gideon against the people who had wronged him in his life. So good!!!<br /><br />\\"Are you hurt anywhere else?\\" I asked, feeling so emotionally raw after the long night we'd had. He caught my wrist and pulled my hand down to press flat over his heart. \\"Here.\\" *sigh* *cries*<br /><br />\\"Look what it's doing to me! I hurt you last might. On purpose. Without even realizing it, because the resentment is eating at me even while I'm convincing myself that I can live with everything you're not telling me.\\" (Eva to Gideon)<br /><br />\\"Don't you have enough to look past as it is? How much shit can I pile on you before you run like hell?\\"(Gideon to Eva)<br /><br />I absolutely love Gideon. I love his crazy-sexy-hot-possessive-sweet-caring-controlling-arrogant-jealous ways. And I love Eva and all her fun-sweet-loving-caring-insecure-jealous ways. They really are the perfect match for each other. I have to say that I am not a huge fan of Cary and especially not after the concert incident, in which if he had just warned Eva, that whole situation could have been avoided!!! UGH!!<br /><br />Reflected In You had some really funny moments between Gideon and Eva. The incident at the pool in Vegas and how Eva got back at Gideon for it and how Gideon reacted to what she did in return, was so funny~loved it!! They also had some really sweet, tender, heartwarming moments that left me a puddle of goo!! LOL<br /><br />\\"I'd rather argue with you, angel, than laugh with anyone else.\\"*sigh*<br /><br />\\"You're the greatest risk I've ever taken.\\" He pressed his lips gently to mine. \\"And the greatest reward.\\" (Gideon to Eva)<br /><br />\\"I was his safe place, which made me rare and invaluable to him.\\"<br /><br />Of course I couldn't end my review without talking about the sex. One of the things that I love about Gideon is that he is a dirty-talker and likes to take control in the bedroom or limo or shower or plane(you get the picture);) Wow...Sylvia Day can definitely write some SMOKIN-HOT, DIRTY, SEXY, PANTY-MELTING, DROOL-WORTHY, SIGH-INDUCING SEX scenes. The scenes in the shower, limo, concert, and on the plane nearly set my Kindle on fire!!! ;) (trust me you want to read these scenes~maybe even highlight them!!) LOL ;)<br /><br />\\"You on your period?\\" I nodded. \\"Then I'll just have to come in your mouth.\\" (Gideon to Eva~That's Gideon for you!!) LOL ;0<br /><br />There isn't really anymore to say after that!! LOL ;)<br /><br />BEST OF THE BEST rating!!!<br /><br />***ARC provided by NetGalley and Penguin Group(USA)~Thank you so much!!\\"I was his safe place, which made me rare and invaluable to him.\\"<br /><br />Of course I couldn't end my review without talking about the sex.

1780891261|5.0|I think the book was dynamic.  After all it is fiction.  We can dream can't we?  Aside from the eroticism, (which that was interesting) the love story was divine.  I wished I could meet a real man like that.  Maybe not with all that money etc., but a take charge type of man.  He might be a little overbearing, but she tamed him down  pretty good.  It's possible for a woman to meet a man that can be tamed and trained, within reason.  So to me, its a five star.  I hope the next book will be about Ana and Christian and their children.  Thanks Ms.James, I appreciate the book.
B00005N6KG|4.0|They are light, and sound awesome when used with Polaroid 2GB Shuffle MP3 Player. They do feel little flimsy but not a deal breaker at all.
B0086700CM|5.0|Very addictive. I started playing the game one night before going to bed and next thing I knew it was two hours later and after midnight. From that point I knew I was hooked.
B003K5ZQGU|5.0|If every woman had a man like Victoria's husband, the world would be another place. I loved the dynamic of the two and even Victoria's flaws as a person were well portrayed. It was realistic and also a powerful story.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|Best golf game yet.  I have played them all.  Superior dynamics and use of physics.  The beginning courses are sufficiently challenging and varied.

B0028MBKVG|5.0|Occasionally I will adventure away from my favorite genre of fantasy/fiction and into non-fiction. \\"Born to Run\\" was certainly a worthy detour. It will challenge your knowledge of aerobic running.<br /><br />  Ultra Marathoning: I had heard bits and pieces about this form of running, but not in any kind of detail like \\"Born to Run\\" covers it. From it's beginnings in the horse races of the American West to the shoe-melting Badwater, the history is engrossing.<br />  People: you can't help but laugh and have \\"wow\\" moments at the real folks described within. It's hard to pick a favorite.<br />  Story Telling: ultimately \\"Born to Run\\" is a fun to read & true to life story that you will want to share with your friends.<br /><br />I am barely considered a runner, but \\"Born to Run\\" will leave you itching for the trail with the knowledge that running was humanity's foundation, and our destiny.
B0098VYCCE|5.0|Very different twist to what I am use to. Captivating plot and story that keeps your attention. Gloom and despair is overcome by good.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|If Sylvia Day's Crossfire series were a drug it would be categorized under the same shelf as some of the worlds most potent drugs. My Kindle was nearly glued to my face while reading this book and I could not put it down from the moment I started. Like Gideon Cross, I went hard and fast with this book and needed to read it like I need air to breathe. REFLECTED IN YOU had me completely enthralled and Sylvia Day left me transfixed on Eva Trammel and Gideon Cross' turbulent and passionate love story.<br /><br />REFLECTED IN YOU picks up the day after the events of Bared to You. Eva and Gideon are working on establishing the foundations of their relationship and in order to do that they must tackle their individual histories plus deal with bouts of jealousy, possessiveness, and insecurities. As if there wasn't enough on their plate, they also have to deal with friends, family and individuals from their past who are set on making their life a little more difficult.<br /><br />To say that REFLECTED IN YOU was high in drama would be an understatement. The emotional highs and lows in this book made me want to reach for that bottle of TUMS and start popping them like Tic-Tacs. Eva and Gideon's relationship has been one major train wreck that I have not been able to tear myself away from. In essence, Eva and Gideon are two people who have no business in being in a relationship, especially with each other. But even when there are so many odds against them, Eva and Gideon fight tooth and nail to hold on to a love and relationship they're addicted to and desperately need.<br /><br />Even with all the drama that unravels in this book, I still believe that Eva and Gideon really do belong to each other. Some say that two wrongs don't make a right but in Eva and Gideons case, they absolutely do. Yes, their relationship is  dysfunctional and stressful but their undying love for each other is undeniable. As flawed as they are, their union only makes sense and honestly there aren't many people in the world who would be able to  put up with all of their issues. As per the usual, Eva played the jealous and feisty girlfriend which only made me like her more. I  give her props for wanting to claim her man and I really admired her for having balls of steel for confronting Gideon's mother, Corinne and Dr. Lucas. As for Gideon...well y'all already know how much I love this man but after reading Reflected in You my love for him even went deeper. He's protective, commanding, and over-bearing as ever and the depths he will go to for Eva will leave some of you quite shocked.  Without giving away any spoilers, I was shocked to find out Sylvia Day took the path that she did with Gideon. I had my feelings about it and wouldn't have doubted it but HOT DANG, Miss Day went \\"there\\" and left me with my jaw dropped.<br /><br />While REFLECTED IN YOU might leave you emotionally exhausted, the roller coaster ride that is Eva and Gideon's relationship is completely worth the pain and suffering. For a popular series like Crossfire with fans who are so engrossed with the characters, Sylvia Day definitely had her work cut out for her follow up to Bared to You. With Reflected in You as one of my mostly anticipated reads for 2012 I am more than happy to state that Sylvia Day more than delivered in this sequel. The emotional highs and lows, intense, passionate and explosive love scenes, and that jaw dropping ending are just a few reasons why this book is one of my favorites from this year (along with Bared to You, of course). If you were a fan of Bared to You, Reflected in You is definitely one book you'll want to get as soon as it hits shelves.<br /><br />I know that Entwined with You will be released in November but I am already dying to find out what the conclusion of Eva and Gideon's relationship will be. Crossfire is definitely my drug of choice and after reading each book, Sylvia Day leaves me on the most amazing book high that I've ever experienced.<br /><br />*ARC received from publisher for an honest reviewceived from publisher for an honest review

B003VXOFEU|4.0|What can I say, the book was well thought up. it seemed so real that is how wounderfuly written it was. i hope for a second book. the book is based on a time why after all of our genirations. were there is no war, color  animals what so ever no pain or true feelings. That is all Jonas has ever known that is intell his twelvth year. when he is chossen to be the next reciver of every memory of time, color war love, loss, true emotions.

B009B2U73I|5.0|I have been a fan of Diana Krall since When I Look Into Your Eyes, and I was worried that she had started to decline (raspy, airy vocals) with Quiet Nights.  If you shared my concerns, cheer up.  Diana Krall is back in a big (although maybe unexpected) way.  Glad Rag Doll finds her taking a page from her husband Elvis Costello's book by teaming up with producing genius T-Bone Burnett.  I think Glad Rag Doll is every bit as good as Secret, Profane & Sugarcane (see my review).<br /><br />While this album is a stylistic departure for Krall, it is so good to hear her voice as it was prior to Quiet Nights.  With Burnett, you can expect more of a roots than jazz sound, but it really works.  Although there are a few funky, up-tempo songs such as \\"There Ain't No Sweet Man That's Worth The Salt Of My Tears\\" and \\"I'm A Little Mixed Up\\", Krall's vocals shine through on the earnest, slower songs such as \\"Here Lies Love\\" and \\"Let It Rain\\" - I'm torn between these two as my favorites from this album.  If you are looking for the traditional Diana Krall sound, give \\"I Used To Love You But It's All Over Now\\" a try.  It has the most jazz elements to it other than the 4 additional tracks on the Deluxe Edition of the album.  The two alternate versions are piano based rather than Burnett's normal guitar arrangements.<br /><br />Overall, this is a nice change of pace for Diana Krall.  Working with Burnett implies making something different, and I think this is a great bounce back CD.  While I would love to hear something that rivals When I Look Into Your Eyes, I am more than satisfied with Glad Rag Doll.  I highly recommend this album to old and new fans alike.  Krall and Burnett make a winning duo.<br /><br />Download this:  Here Lies Love

B009G8GRX6|4.0|If you are like me, your only prior reference for Muse is \\"Uprising\\".  If you are like I was, you have no idea how limited your point of view is.  The 2nd Law is a rare album that manages to both sound great and capture my imagination/intellect.  If you are wondering what the title of the album refers to, it is the second law of thermodynamics which in short states that in an isolated system entropy (or disorder) increases over time.  Muse attempts to apply this to technological and economic growth over the course of the album.  Whether you buy into their position or argument, it shows a level of thought that is uncommon.  The sounds are big with a competing balance between rock instruments and electronics.  The vocal delivery is elongated with a fair amount of falsetto punctuation - no more so that at the end of the chorus on \\"Supremacy\\".  Everything fits into the some creative plain.  Most of the songs are loosely structured and avoid the radio hit formula of verse/chorus/verse/chorus/solo/chorus.  On \\"Madness\\" a digitized line of \\"M-m-m-m-m-mad-mad-mad\\" as a recurring undercurrent lends, well, a feel of madness.  Muse also uses a variety of styles.  While I was taken in by the mellow and earnest \\"Explorers\\", I couldn't help but notice similarities to other big acts such as INXS on \\"Panic Station\\", Foo Fighters on \\"Liquid State\\", and Bono-esque vocals toward the end of \\"Madness\\".<br /><br />Some may find The 2nd Law to be preachy or pretentious, but I don't think that is the intent.  While it is very creative, I don't believe it is meant to be taken literally.  It is over the top both sonically and conceptually, but in the end it makes for some very good ear candy.  I challenge you to listen to it a few times and then try to get it out of your head.  If you give this album a try, I don't think you will be disappointed.<br /><br />Download this:  Explorers
B005LAII8A|5.0|Rian Johnson is one of the best young directors working today. His first two movies, \\"Brick\\" amd \\"The Brothers Bloom,\\" took themes and tropes from older movies, then recombined them in fascinating, energizing ways. His latest film, \\"Looper,\\" is his finest yet, indeed one of the best films of the year. The plot of \\"Looper\\" isn't new; we saw bits and pieces of it in \\"12 Monkeys\\" (one of Bruce Willis' previous movies), \\"Inception\\" (one of Joseph Gordon-Levitt's previous movies), \\"The Terminator,\\" \\"Blade Runner,\\" and \\"Children of Men,\\" among others. What is new is the depth of characterization and emotion Johnson achieves here, and the moral and intellectual issues he raises about the issue of time travel.<br /><br />Johnson's initial concept--that the mob of the future has seized control of time travel and uses it to carry out untraceable hits--is brilliance bordering on genius. So is the concept of \\"loopers\\"--i.e. hit men who carry out the time-travel hits, finishing their contracts by blowing away the thirty-years-later versions of themselves. Those concepts give Johnson the framework to create his own, very convincing, near-future dystopia. It also gives two very fine actors, Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, the chance to create a repellent but sympathetic character at two different times of his life, and to have him face what he was and what he's become. Both actors give thrilling performances, but I have to make special mention of how Gordon-Levitt--wearing facial prostheses to make him look like Willis--so perfectly captures Willis' movements, speech patterns and, most remarkably, his facial expressions, which the best prosthetics in the world can't fake.<br /><br />Many reviewers have recounted the story of \\"Looper\\" here; I will not, because the less you know going in, the better. I will remark on the general excellence of the cast: Emily Blunt as a young woman with whom Gordon-Levitt has a fateful encounter; little Pierce Gagnon as Blunt's son, who combines the adorable and the creepy to an astonishing degree; Paul Dano and Noah Segan as two of Gordon-Levitt's fellow loopers; and Jeff Daniels as the mob boss, an intriguing cross between Michael Corleone and Dude Lebowski. The technical credits are also remarkable, including Johnson's usual cameraman (Steve Yedlin) and composer (Nathan Johnson, his cousin). Considered one by one, the details of Johnson's futuristic vision probably wouldn't hang together completely. But they hang together well enough to make an exciting, persuasive and moving film.es the adorable and the creepy to an astonishing degree; Paul Dano and Noah Segan as two of Gordon-Levitt's fellow loopers; and Jeff Daniels as the mob boss, an intriguing cross between Michael Corleone and Dude Lebowski.

B003AYMZO2|5.0|This series is so awesome, I love how characters are introduced and situations arise that surface in later episodes.  Very well written series.
B009G8GRX6|5.0|I am not sure where I would rank this among all Muse's work. During and since The Resistance album, I was growing a little tired of muse, but still respected them. The Resistance is probably my least favorite of there albums, though it had its moments and was not a bad album by any means - but when comparing it to a standard muse had already set for itself, it is hard to compete. Upon hearing the album trailer of \\"The 2nd Law: Unsustainable\\" I was worried. Thankfully this sound was not common throughout the album, and the song actually works okay with the album as a whole. The 2nd Law has brought me back to my feelings I had for the old muse, though it is a new sound. I do not know if I would call it my favorite album, but it is something new and fresh that I am enjoying almost as much as when I first heard origin of symmetry. If you are feeling a little uncertain after the first listen, go for a drive with the speakers cranked up, and it might just hit you. Hope they come to my state so I can see them live.
B008F5YDRI|3.0|Can the English survive an outlandish plan to bring Western Civilization to Yemen, along the Sinai Peninsula?<br />It's Fishing for Islam in the Yemen, or \\"Salmon Fishing in the Yemen,\\" the movie.<br />A sheik, played by Amr Waked, is in love with fishing in his posh estate in Scotland, and would like to bring it to more arid land down south.<br />It turns out to be something of a romantic comedy involving two empires - British and Islamic.<br />The movie stars Ewan McGregor as Dr. Afred Jones, Emily Blunt as Harriet Chetwood-Tolbert, and Kristin Scott Thomas as Patricia Maxwell, the prime minister's press secretary.<br />Blunt represents the sheik's financial interests through Fitzharris & Price International Investment Division, with a London office.<br />The breezy contrast between McGregor and the sophisticated Blunt, make the movie work.<br />Maxwell is on the hunt for some good news for His Majesty's Government Press Office and the prime minister to offset the bombing of a mosque in Afghanistan by British military.<br />McGregor is pressured into meeting with Blunt, who represents the sheiks assets in Britain, which includes an estate in Scotland.<br />Yemen gets more rain than Saudi Arabia, she points out to McGregor - up to 250 millimeters of rain per month during some months.<br />The long term plan is to irrigate thousands of acres of desert, she says.<br />McGregor projects the cost at approximately $50 million dollars or pounds.<br />\\"He's a very keen fisherman,\\" she says of the sheik. \\"I don't really think it's my place to explain the sheik's motivations. But I will say this. Of all our wealthy clients, he is different. I would go so far as to describe him as a visionary man.\\"<br />\\"A visionary,\\" Jones repeats incredulously.<br />\\"Yes I know, it's not a very fashionable word,\\" she says. \\"But if you decide to take this project with us, then you can decide for yourself when you meet him.\\"<br />McGregor leaves, walking into a wall on the way out of her office, prompting a giggle from Blunt.<br /><br />The two join the sheik at his favorite estate in Scotland, where he fishes with Jones.<br />Waked questions McGregor's reluctance to engage in the project.<br />Judged by this particular sheik's behavior, muslim men can act in an honorable and civilized manner.<br />He has benefited from a proper English education, and gained a proper English accent.<br />Can fishing bring a shot of civilization to a Muslim land?<br />It's a question that may be a tale of contrasts between the extreme belief of Islam, and little or no belief by the English, who have mostly given up on God.<br /><br />\\"You're not a religious man?\\" he says to McGregor.<br />\\"No, I'm not.\\"<br />\\"But you are a fisherman, Dr. Jones.\\"<br />\\"I'm sorry, I don't follow.\\"<br />\\"How many hours do you fish before you catch something? Dozens.\\"<br />\\"Hundreds sometimes.\\"<br />\\"Is that a good use of your time for a facts and figures man? But you persist, in the wind and the rain and the cold, with such poor odds of success. Why? Because you are a man of faith, Dr. Alfred.\\"<br />In the end, you are rewarded for your faith and constancy, with fish.\\"<br />\\"With due respect, fishing and religion are hardly the same thing, your excellency.\\"<br />\\"With equal respect, I have to disagree.\\"<br />\\"A toast. To faith and fish.\\"<br />\\"To faith and fish - and science.\\"<br /><br />Does fishing demonstrate faith? Or is it simply a sporting way for many English fishermen to pass the time, whether they catch the fish or not?<br />It may be important to point out that is is not necessary to fish in the wind, rain or cold to enjoy fishing.<br />Nevertheless, not only is the sheik a man of great faith, he knows when a woman is unhappy and senses that Blunt is uneasy or unhappy.<br />I have put my feet in it, he says, describing his too sensitive observations.<br />He then violates traditional Muslim culture by shaking hands with Blunt.<br /><br />The sheik gets resistance about the idea from the Muslim tribe in Yemen, who confront him.<br />\\"These men, they say that by bringing water, life to this dessert, I am bringing the Western ways to our land. They say I have insulted God himself. I say they are fools.\\"<br />The problem with their argument is that it is actually true.<br />He is bringing Western ways to the dessert, something that Muslims still struggle to accept, even if it means living a better life and saving lives.<br />And the West still has significant problems bringing modern ideas and methods to areas like Afghanistan.<br />Entities like the Taliban make it more difficult to educate young girls in traditional Muslim countries.<br />The Western ideal of helping developing countries to end suffering with modern technology is something that is still being rejected in largely Muslim areas.<br /><br />The sheik has plenty of money to spend on creating an unnatural environment for the fish.<br />And so begins the somewhat wild journey or fantasy, led by an oil-rich sheik.<br />Before the water flows, he addresses the group gathered:<br />\\"Muslims, Christians - we are all gathered here in an act of faith - and why not.\\"<br />It's doubtful that there are any British citizens gathered who would claim Jesus Christ or being Christian.<br />It's not even a good idea for Muslims to acknowledge that there are Christians in a Muslim country.<br /><br />Jones does seem to symbolize the British, who don't seem to know what to do with God or faith.<br />It's as though the British are willing to allow the Muslims to take the lead in the faith, since they have become mostly Godless.<br />Though Islam is an extreme religion, producing radical elements, at least the Muslims have more faith than the average British citizen, who believes in his football club more than God.<br />It is a little surprising that the writer included a traditional Islamic weaponry.<br />Though the sheik may be civilized, he still wears his dagger.<br />Traditionally, it isn't usedfor cleaning fish, but for dismembering infidels.<br /><br />© 2012 Larry Ingram
0385343248|5.0|Very, very good story that moves right along and with believable characters.  I had this on the shelf for years and finally decided to read it or pass it on...glad I chose to read it.  I learned about the cultures depicted even though I suspected it may not be completely historically accurate.  It is so good I could hardly put it down, and so large it took most of a week to read it.  Not something I wanted to skim through.  You'll be glad you read it.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|Good game. A little laggy at times but enjoyable none the less. Of course there's items for cash but what game doesn't have that anymore.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|Reflected in You is the second book in the Crossfire series, the first being Bared to You. This book wrecked me. I felt so discombobulated throughout. One moment I was blissfully happy, because Gideon and Eva were making things work between them, and then the next chapter, I would be thrown into the deep end without a paddle, drowning in their drama. There is nothing like the front row seat, watching this couple lose control over their tumultuous emotions for one another. I guess I'm a Sadist, because I loved every second of this painful, emotional story.<br /><br />\\"My past was as violent as his, and I was just as broken. We'd never work. It was too hard, too painful... except when it was perfect. Those moments when the driving hunger and desperate love were the most exquisite insanity. We were bound by our need. And our passion would take us beyond our limits to the sweetest, sharpest edge of obsession.\\"<br /><br />Gideon and Eva are two broken people who are survivors of sexual abuse. Their love for each other is fierce and obsessive. In order to make this relationship work, they both agree to seek therapy together since neither one knows how to be in a healthy, normal relationship. They both have big trust issues. But one thing they don't have to worry about is their steamy sex life. The sexual chemistry is powerful, combustible.<br /><br />\\"His kisses were gifts. He kissed with everything he had, with power and passion and hunger and love. He held nothing back, giving everything, exposing everything.\\"<br /><br />Even though Eva and Gideon are able to connect through passionate sex and love, sometimes that's not enough to hold a relationship together. Gideon is a man of mystery. Not only will he not share his childhood secrets, but he's pulling away from Eva. He is keeping a secret from her which causes her insecurities to get the best of her and drives a wedge between them. I felt for Eva during this time. She put her heart out there and found it difficult to have faith in him. I was pissed at Gideon because he kept his silence and did nothing to console Eva's doubts.<br /><br />The suspense of not knowing was frustrating and gut-wrenching. But, when this story comes full circle, you will not only love Gideon for being his usual controlling, demanding, ahole self, but you will love him because of his undying love for Eva.<br /><br />\\"I'm going to fall,\\" I slurred, drunk with pleasure. \\"I'll catch you, angel. I'll always catch you.\\"<br /><br />Even though this couple struggles throughout the book, there is character growth at the end. Eva finally finds her back bone and they both learn to trust one another. I rooted for Eva and Gideon every step of the way. They may be frustrating, with their lack of communication and their tendency to be overly possessive and jealous, but they are still my favorite dysfunctional couple.<br /><br />This rocky relationship is intense and emotional. The story is beautiful as you see their unconditional love for one another unfold through sacrifices. I haven't stopped thinking about this book since I read it a few days ago. The ending will blow your mind and you will be reminded why you love this couple so much, even though they will exhaust you with their ups and downs.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game it reminds me of playing a game at a carnival. I love it if you like carnivvals play it
B008N5UX9M|5.0|I listened to this album without thinking about Maiden influences, and I think is great. This is not heavy metal, is a solid hard rock album and shows Steve Harris versatility.
B008B11R1Q|5.0|It grows on you.  Darker than their first CD, but sooo good.  I downloaded a copy and also ordered the actual CD.
B004Q3RKH8|5.0|Very nice 180 grms edition. The booklet inside is beautiful. About the music, what can we say about Pearl Jam? Just Amazing!!!
0439023513|5.0|Great for any age each book in the series just keeps getting better.  Unlike many series doesn't just start off with a bang.  Really felt connected to the characters
B005HJWWW8|5.0|It make good headphones sound Great and Great headphones sound Awesome!  It adds a punch to the sound coming out the headphones! Must have for working out and mowing the lawn!
0439023491|5.0|Great books for any age and I'm 54 not the market they were written for.  Fast paced great political commentary.
B007Y6OZE0|4.0|I've been listening to these guys for just shy of 20 years.  I discovered Smash back in high school when a friend gave me a cassette copy of it.  I listened to that album over and over and over again. They introduced me to punk rock.  Almost 20 years later my musical tastes have changed but I still love these guys.<br /><br />Unfortunately this album was released just a little too late.  Had it been released between Americana and Conspiracy of One, it'd have been a huge hit.  Days Go By serves as a great follow up to Americana.  It is a great mix of punk rock with some pop.  But at this point in their career people don't take them too seriously.  That's too bad.  This is a great album.  It helps you forget how bad Rise and Fall was.<br /><br />Standout tracks have to include Slim Pickens, Dividing by Zero, The Future is Now, and Secrets from the Underground.  I do enjoy Hurting By You.  It's just every so often it has the feel of a filler track.  All I Have Left is You is The Offspring doing a ballad right (i'm looking at you A Lot Like Me).  I won't offer an opinion on Cruisin' California.  The Offspring always write cheesy pop songs (Hit That, Original Prankster).  Why should anyone be surprised to find one on this album?<br /><br />Casual fan of the band?  Fan of the band who has been turned off by their recent efforts?  Give this album a shot.  I don't think you'll be disappointed.
B008C1O8CA|4.0|\\"Uno\\" is a great entry in the lore of a classic band that has been producing quality music for many, many years.  Keeping the \\"classic\\" Green Day sound (with some even contending that this album moves closer to the old-school style of the band's early years) while dumping the vast majority of the socio-politcal commentary of their last few albums, die-hard fans should find plenty to enjoy here in the first of a planned three-album onslaught in the coming months.<br /><br />As other reviewers have noted, there are explicit versions and clean versions of this album, so take care in which you would prefer and which you select to buy.  I personally snatched up the explicit $5 digital version on it's second day of release.  Six of the 12 songs are marked as \\"explicit,\\" but I had to listen through the album three times before I actually, consciously heard any of the curse words - I guess I've just grown accustomed to Green Day being so filthy, eh?  What to you expect from a band whose initials are G.D.? :)
B007CGLRWA|5.0|Dear Reader, made in a documentary style, Detachment is a product of director Tony Kaye (yes, the same guy who made American History X) and Adrien Brody (in yet another role of a life time) This is not one of those films that sit on the edge and meander, this film truly takes film making to another level and back to school. The screenplay is resounding and moving. The film deals with politics -> condition of teachers, student, white america, black america, fat american teenagers with insecurities, prostitution, the women degradation trip America has adopted, the importance of reading and to end it deals with loneliness. I would say it's the most moving relevant film of last year (2011) and trust you me I've seen atleast 25 very good films from the year. Adrien Brody kills it. Do yourself a favor and watch the film they're not going to honor with Oscar and noone in the world will talk about. If you thought American History X was ambitious, you're in for a pleasant surprise cause Detachment aims higher, barks louder and eventually leaves you flabbergasted.
B00846REIS|3.0|Good & racy, but too close to \\"50 Shades\\" for me. I wish the author had used more original material and made more of a story line - more than one sex scene after the other. But, it kept my interest enough to buy book two when it becomes available!

B007IXWL2C|4.0|HOT!!  After I got over my shock while reading the first book, I actually enjoyed the plot and the characters.  I think most mature adults would appreciate this read, but I really don't think it's appropriate for the younger reader.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, you really couldn't read it with out getting a bit effected yourself.  It was at times very funny, and just a great read..  Starting the second book now.

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I live this game and its great fir passing time at work.  wish tootle had cooler apps like apple like this one.
0525953728|1.0|I found this book basically boring. Some reviewers say it is light on operations, but good on Seal training and the Osama raid. Wrong.... It's light on Seal training and there's precious little about the Osama raid that wasn't reported early on. Sure, Owen takes some pot shots at Obama and quibbles about a few details and who should get credit, but it's all pretty gratuitous. If you want a really good read about Seal training and an operation, read Lone Survivor by Marcus Lutrell. A similar good read about USMC Force Recon training, the making of an officer, and an extended operation is One Bullet Away by Nathaniel F[[ASIN:0618773436 One Bullet Away: The Making of a Marine Officer]]. Save your money.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I was hesitant to buy this book, as I had heard that other SEALs were not happy with it - and had viewed this book as a breaking of trust.<br /><br />I also gotta say, I LOVE the military. I am such a patriot that thinking of the word 'patriot' brings tears to my eyes.<br /><br />I truly enjoyed and appreciated the history that the author gave; what brought him to becoming a SEAL, early training for DEVGRU, and some background on the formation of the soon-to-be-elite team of elites. I so truly appreciated his candor, and that he said there was a lot he couldn't say. I'm okay with that! What he gave just made me love and respect the military, especially the elite military, and especially the SEALs even MORE!!<br /><br />As to the supposed political bashing?? POPPYCOCK! The truth of the matter is, regardless of which person and which party they serve is in the white house (D, R, I, G, whatever) -- that person would 'take credit' and say \\"we took UBL down\\" -- it's just a fact! What this book throws in your face is that a huge number of real men risked their very lives for this mission. The suits in the white house just said \\"yeah, go\\" (and listened)<br /><br />REAL MEN RISK THEIR VERY LIVES ... EVERY DAY ... to keep us safe, and most of it, we never hear of. War isn't pretty. Don't expect it to be.<br /><br />The only bad thing I can say about this book - is that I wanted more. More of everything. I finished it in a few nites. I'm off to reading \\"SEAL Team Six: Memoirs of an Elite Navy SEAL Sniper\\" as my buddy tells me it's even more awesome than this book!<br /><br />Thank you for this book. I really enjoyed it. Definitely a good read. Highly recommend it.
B006LSZECO|1.0|never posted a review.  but this book , i don't know i think i must have read a very different book than everyone else.  I HATED  this book.  the writing was poor, the plot obvious and the ending (which i skipped to) incredibly disatisfying.  I judge a book on whether i want to keep on reading to find out what happen-i pushed-i really did-but could push no more.  the plot literally screams the outcome and the revelation of nicks weaknesses only emphasizes that he is not the problem.  would never recommend.  in fact i left my copy in the hotel room cuz i couldn't see lugging it back across the country to just toss it.
1476712042|5.0|I loved this book.Couldn't put it down.I realize some people critique this book to death.They complain of too much violence,too much co-dependcy,abby is crazy and selfish,blah,blah,blah! So many books are fairy tales,love,sex and happily ever after.truth of the matter is \\"Beautiful Disaster\\" shows us that life is not always fairy tale yet,the author stills finds beauty in Travis and abby.Yes,they are flawed and yes Travis has issues.Thats the point of the story.Life is not perfect and neither are travis and abby.I cant wait for \\"Walking Disaster\\".Maybe we will see why travis is so violent.I predict i'm going to love him even more and feel pity even more when i get his point of view
B008QTV3X0|4.0|I stumbled upon the Amazon Instant App on my TV and thought, why do I need Apple TV.  The amount of content and seamlessness of purchase was easy.  Now to the Series, totally worth the price, although it would be nice to have the option of renting a whole series, rather than having to buy it.
0756405890|4.0|First of all, I must admit I'm not a fan of the fantasy genre.  I especially don't like what I call \\"hardcore fantasy\\" that contains bizarre made-up creatures, languages, dragons, etc.  I never liked fantasy games like D&D and I can't stand ridiculousness like Harry Potter.<br /><br />Even for a non-fantasy lover like me, this is a good book.  Rothfuss has a very readable writing style and the book flows well.  Most of all, I like that the magic and fantasy elements of the book are not over-the-top ridiculous.  The \\"magic\\" in the book is based more on logic and science (with just a dash of flash) than many fantasy books.  I like that we DON'T see wizards slaying 200 ft long dragons and causing earthquakes.  The \\"dragon\\" in this book is a big lizard that is a herbivore.  The magic in this book is simple (starting a fire) and the power of the \\"Masters\\" in the story are never really revealed completely.<br /><br />The one thing I didn't like was that I thought the book would cover more territory in the main character's (Kvothe) life.  The jacket of the book gave me the impression that it covered a good portion of his life, but it's really just a few years of his childhood.  It left me wishing the book had less detail and moved farther along in time.<br /><br />Otherwise, I really liked this book and Mr Rothfuss has gained me as a fan of his work.

B008RV5K5E|4.0|Part 1 of TDKReturns is about an ageing Batman (voiced by Peter Weller,\\"Robocop\\",\\"Dexter:Season 5\\"). Violence is at a Gotham City peak not yet seen since the Joker years. Ten years have passed since the city has seen the Batman, most think he's a myth. Until Batman becomes one with the shadows again, and decides to clean up the town, no matter how much his old body fails. Bruce Wayne is sodden over the deaths of Jason Todd and Dick Grayson, when he comes upon a mysterious female rogue dressed in a Robin costume, he connects with her, and now a new dynamic duo is set to clean up the streets.<br />Commissioner Gordon retires, still with the hope that Batman can change things, but the new Chief is reluctant to let Batman get away with his crimes.<br />Great animation, awesome bat-toys and bone-crunching galore. TDKReturns Part 1, is a great movie, and will hopefully wet all of our appetites until TDKRises comes out.<br />Can't wait for Part 2.

B003SWNRU2|5.0|Like most people, I first heard Accept a long time ago with \\"Balls To The Wall\\", and their pint sized singer Udo Dirkschneider.  Frankly, I dismissed them as an AC/DC clone, and you can't argue that they did indeed bear than just a passing resemblance to Angus and company.  However, after reading positive reviews of more recent material, I found \\"Blood Of The Nations\\" in a bargain bin ($7.99) and thought \\"what the hell.\\"<br />  Well, the album may have had a bargain bin price, but it is anything but a cut rate half assed record.  From the track opener \\"Beat The Bastards\\", which is a thrashingly heavy tune to CD's end, I find Accept to be fine example of the classic metal of titans like Judas Priest and Saxon.  In fact, they do bear a bit of resemblance to latter day Saxon without ripping them off, and that's a good thing.  \\"Blood of the Nations\\" features the debut vocals of Mark Tormillo, who has a good rough voice but also has great range.  Best of all, he sings, not grunts.  Produced by Andy Sneap, this album sounds great.  Other cuts like \\"Pandemic\\" and the title track are headbangers of the first order, and even the slower tunes that feature a bit of melodic background music still manage to impress.<br />  Accept have not quite broken as a classic metal band, partly due to their 10 year hiatus and the rise of fellow German bands Kreator, Sodom and Destruction, who more or less have dominated German metal.  Those looking for great classic metal need look no further.

0142419400|5.0|Amazing. Absolutely amazing. I was at Stephanie Perkins mercy after reading page one. Anna and the French Kiss was witty and funny and I loved every minute I spent reading. I was so in love that I stayed up reading until 6am because I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />Anna is sent to Paris for her senior year of high school. Being pulled from one school and put into another school is hard, but it's even harder when that school is in a different country. After her parents leave her that first night, she cries, missing home and realizing that she's on her own now. Only, she isn't on her own. The girl next door, Meredith, hears her crying and offers her an easy friendship. Then she meets him: Etienne St. Clair.<br /><br />I hate that I waited so long to read Anna and the French Kiss. It was so well-written and I fell in love with Anna, Etienne, and the story. I found myself laughing frequently and I actually sat the on the edge of my seat waiting to see how it would end. I was enthralled and could barely put it down when my eyes were begging for sleep. The setting was perfect and The City of Lights was described in such amazing detail.<br /><br />Anna is so sweet and funny. She reminded me of my best friend. Etienne is this dreamy, swoon worthy American with a French name and an English accent. He is sweet and down-to-earth. I'm so in love with them both.<br /><br />Overall, I'm so upset with myself for not reading Anna and the French Kiss sooner. It pulled at my heart and it is the perfect read if you need your spirits lifted. Amazing. I highly recommend this book!<br /><br />Review originally posted at Doodle's Book Blog
B004LROMX4|5.0|Absolutely wonderful show. I've only ever had a couple of shows that kept my interest. Hopefully this show doesn't suffer the same fate as my favorite all time series, Firefly.

1451662432|1.0|After reading the reviews, I am thankful that I don't have to read this book. This book confirms his character, and lack of introspection.<br />We should boycott the publisher!!
B0098VYCCE|2.0|A lot of publicity (hype).<br />Terrible sound quality ... No equalization ...Had to increase volume while talking and decrease during music and action.<br />Terrible unintelligible accents made it difficult to follow plot.<br />Disjointed, like pieces of the movie were cut out.<br />Depended on visual effects. The only decent acting was presented by Charlize Theron (Evil Queen)<br />Overall, the most worthless movie I've rented since joining Amazon.
B0086700CM|4.0|It is fun and very addictive ;)The game is fun and a bit challenging in the beginning. You don't really go through different levels, rather you just always keep going until you die in the game.
B007GCY8FS|2.0|If Child cannot write a better novel on his Jack Reacher character than this one, perhaps it is time for Reacher's demise.  This was dull, repetitive and flat out boring.  The last two books before this were starting to swing this way, but this one convinces me this is the case.  I normally read a Child novel straight through but this one I put down and didn't get back to for several days.  Without giving up any details of the storyline, I found it to be weak and unbelievable even for fiction.  The characters developed in this novel were uninteresting, confusing and were not credible.  An example of lacking credibility is why a child is brought into a dangerous undercover role involving her mother, an FBI agent.  No mother nor any government agency would allow such a situation to occur.  There are so many holes in this book, the little bit of credibility other Reacher novels have is out the door in this one.  Perhaps, Child should spend more time creating/writing his next Reacher novel or just end the character.  I would hope for more Reacher novels but will be hard pressed to read more if the storyline is no better than this.
B004FHP9KA|3.0|A little too much thinking required for my liking.  Keeping track off all the dream levels, how they work, and how the characters interact in each others dreams is more complex than time travel!
0670023329|3.0|The story is about Shin Dong-hyuk who was born in a labor camp and escaped in his early 20's; one of the rare people who have done so. I am always appalled  everytime i read about  the cruel and all-pervading repression of this regime. However, i didn't enjoy this book as much as I thought i would. There wasn't any tension or suspense which there should have been in spite of knowing that an escape occurred. I think its because of the disjointed and chunky style of writing.<br /><br />Shin is not a very sympathetic character and i'm sure its because his entire formative and developmental years were spent in this isolated evil love-lacking environment where hunger and torture were common. absolutely no relationships were forged. so i tried to keep remembering this fact when i became annoyed at Shin's failure to stick with learning English for instance.<br /><br />A much better written and very very interesting book is Barbara Demick's Nothing To Envy; published in 2010. She writes about several families who ended up escaping but since they were not in camps and held jobs and had relationships with neighbors and married and fell in love, etc. it was a super powerful read because i could relate to the events which occurred to these ordinary folk and that's it in a nutshell; i could not relate to Shin at all.

B007BT0RKG|1.0|You really can't do anything of substance without it asking you to purchase the full version.  Waste of time and space, and would steer others away from it if given the chance.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I just love this app. it's excellent, a ton of inventive ideas, with tutorials and web pages that are linked.<br />Haven't had any issues with it so far.<br />not enough refresh buttons, you have to hit arrows back, when I use on the kindle, but other than that, I still find it fun and informative.
0007170874|5.0|This book was recommended literature in two independent change management classes I took in Stanford and Berlin. I finally decided to buy it and I'm so glad I did. It's amazingly easy to read - not a textbook but a novel, almost as tantalizing as a detective story. You just want to find out how he did it. Even when the classes were over I continued reading the book and finished it in no time.
B000ICKPOQ|5.0|I have been a fan of Stargate Atlantis, from day one and i think the series is great. the story lines, the special affects and the characters are very well done.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I love a book that makes you think about the plot, characters, scenes months after you finished the book.<br />Not only did I buy the book on my kindle for me to read, I purchased two hard back copies for my high school's library.<br /><br />Life isn't fair... life isn't easy... But you can find a way to not only survive but to thrive.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I picked up this book after reading many reviews and stories about it expecting it to primarily be about the capture of Osama Bin Laden (UBL) and to tell you the truth was surprised in a pleasant way that although that was surely the marquee event described in the book, it was really about so much more.  Mark Owen (pseudonym) writes not only about the capture of UBL but really primarily about his experience qualifying for the Seals and then Seal Team 6--the elite of the elite.  He talks in great detail about how difficult it is to make Seal Team 6, the day by day tests they underwent to weed out the weakest of the bunch, and then immediately goes into detail on specific missions he was a part of culminating in his being in the room for the capture of UBL.  I very much enjoyed the book, thought it was well written, and recommend it to anyone who enjoys reading first person military accounts.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|I have not finished reading this book but this is one of those you get trapped and want to read everytime you have 10 minutes free. The basic idea of how habits are wired in our heads and the real life examples provided gives a clear understanding of how it works and how to tweak the way our brain wires them.
B004QKNXIQ|3.0|The movie was predictable like all other fairy tales. I knew in advance that the boy would get the girl in the end - like they always do. A little twist in the plot would have been welcome. It provided enjoyable, light entertainment on an otherwise boring afternoon.
B008XG1X18|3.0|I love Pinterest. It doesn't always work when I open it. It usually takes 3 or 4 tries to open it. When it opens on the first try, it's like a miracle.
B003VANOFY|5.0|The sound quality is very good. When you speak with people over Skype, it feels like people are right in front of you. Directional simulation is very good for video games also. I can tell from which direction gun shots are being fired when I play Black Ops. Microphone quality is crisp and clear. Charger port is \\"Micro B USB\\" and the cord is sorta a pain to get in to the charging port. Wireless is significant improvement over frustrating cables. Programmable buttons are kinda useless. You would have to take your left hand off the keyboard to use one of those buttons... useless for games but maybe it would be OK for tasks outside of games.<br /><br />This headset is heavier than other headsets I have used, but it does not feel uncomfortable. In fact, they are very comfortable. I haven't noticed any discomfort after wearing them for long periods of time (several hours).
B0084I9QI2|5.0|This is a wonderful product, in the package there is such a beautiful stuff!<br />You can remember the Bad Era in a full way and this is also such a moving feeling!<br /><br />I' ve cried a bit, after seeing and listening all the CDs.<br /><br />I recommend this product, no way!
B0047Y17P2|5.0|This is quite the lawyer book. this is a wonderfull novel in which this is the only book ive read in the series and fully understand and enjoyed. in this book there is a girl (the suspect) Lisa Tramel who is accused of murdering Mitchel Bondurant who was in charge of the forclosure on her home. this is a great book in which i would reccomend to any murder mystery enthusiast.<br /> I would like to become a lawyer so this book alone gave me a great insight on the investigating, process of courts, witness questioning, examinations & cross~examinations, and every little detail of case\trial and all of what beimg a lawyer consists of. plase read!
B008BIN9EW|5.0|I can finally play Chess like they do in Star Wars!<br /><br />The bad news is that I get my butt kicked all the time.  The game keeps track of your score and ranking and pairs you up with people of a similar ability level.  I win slightly over half of my battles.<br /><br />It's fun to play people from all over the world... they put a little flag next to each person's name.  I don't recognize most of them... I need to find a flag chart.<br /><br />I'm assuming that the three races are well balanced but I can't help but think that the bots are the best... their walkers have a range of 5 spaces... better than anything else out there... they are seriously hard to take out.<br /><br />I wish there were some youtube tutorials out there... I could use some pointers.<br /><br />I was playing 10 games at once... I think they let you go up to 20.

B003ZWN7KU|3.0|George A. Romero is the father of the modern day zombie. No one will argue that his work has set the genre in motion to become the wonderful world that we all love to live in today. He transformed the idea of the voodoo zombie into something a bit more creative, scary, and something a lot closer to home. What many people may argue though is the quality of his films over the years. Some say his creativity has gone up while many also say his story telling has gone down.<br /><br />Let me start off by saying that the fact that we're seeing Romero try something for the first time in an ACTUAL sequel to one of his other films is an interesting take. By that I of course mean that our lead character Sarge\\" Crockett (Alan Van Sprang) was actually a minor character in Romero's previous entry, Diary of the Dead. This is the first time Romero had the ability (or realistically the legal rights) to continue any of his now 6 entries into the \\"of the Dead\\" series. (Unless you count the extremely brief appearance of Tom Savini being in Dawn and Land as a zombie.)<br /><br />Sarge is leading what is left of his military unit on a path to safety. Where that safety is though they currently have no idea and on top of that they are willing to loot and pillage to get there. What they end up fighting is a secure island. The only problem is the island is already inhabited by 2 Irish families who are at war with each other and have their own ideas on what should be done with the dead. The soldiers that we are following quickly fall into the middle of a struggle between these wo clans and leaves them in a state of array trying to figure out both which side to take and how to really survive.<br /><br />While I'm not sure I enjoy Romero going to CGI for his zombies I will fully give him credit for knowing how to properly use it compared to most of the cgi'd zombie films that are out currently. The kills are gory, the flesh eating is perfect, and as usual Romero has picked a new way for zombies to 'evolve' - though I can't say I like HOW they evolved at the end of the film.<br /><br />While still not as good as Dawn or Day this is Romero's best attempt of his last three. It actually help my attention until the end at which point I had to get a little annoyed. First with how the zombies 'evolve' in this one and second the way the choice the survivors make on where to go and how to survive. If they had just stayed put it would have been easy to clear out and actually have a safe haven to call their own. The chance they take in their decision seems to be one of the more annoying choices a Romero character has made - specially with how much actually loved the build up to that point.to 'evolve' - though I can't say I like HOW they evolved at the end of the film.<br /><br />While still not as good as Dawn or Day this is Romero's best attempt of his last three.

B0098VXCR0|2.0|This movie had a chance. It really did and honestly is started off well. The plot was a unique twist on the classic fairy tale and all seemed well. Then entered Kristin Stewart as Snow White... Uggh. Hopefully she will be able to purchase some acting lessons with what she made on this movie because breathing heavily and looking sad/confused all the time doesn't make the cut. Its really too bad because Charlize Theron was remarkable as the evil queen and it's a shame to cast a horrendous actress such as Stewart opposite Theron. The only value in watching this movie was that I can now, without a shadow of doubt, save money in the future by avoiding any film with Kristin Stewart in the credits.
0062082353|5.0|I really appreciated Chris Kyle taking the time to write his autobiography.  Taya Kyle's additions to the book was a twist I wasn't expecting and really shows how hard it is on the home front.  This is a must read for all of us strap hangers out there.  We all need to listen more to Warriors like Chris Kyle and, ideally, to try and keep the Warriors in their unique communities once they do decide to pop smoke to become Instructors or related support roles to help train-up the green guys replacing them and ensure they are outiftted with the best gear.

B006LSZECO|3.0|This book  has a captivating story line and one wants to continue reading it; the ending was not what I expected; perhaps there have been so many excellent reviews I was expecting more.  There are various themes woven into the plot with interpersonal relationships and conflicts so it makes one think.  Interesting, different and I would recommend.
B001EN71CW|4.0|Firefly kept getting recommended to me.  From friends, from Netflix, and then, from Amazon.  Given how little it cost for this DVD, I felt I had to get it.  I don't feel this is Academy-award material by any means, but it is, as I said, \\"very solid\\".  The acting is good, the production is clean.  The sets and environments are interesting, and well-crafted.  The script walks the line between funny and serious.  It isn't a comedy, but there is camaraderie and joking, but also a willingness to explore serious topics and not pull punches in the process.  The characters are interesting and unique, and have an obvious chemistry.  It is definitely enjoyable.  I love the theme song, it's pretty awesome, and perfectly suited to the show (though I don't know if it was custom-made for that purpose).<br /><br />If you like this, I would recommend Legend of the Seeker.  A very similar show in many regards (though fantasy), also cancelled early (though it made it further along).  The Legend of the Seeker is based off the Sword of Truth series, and deals with a lot of moral issues.

B0093OGBL6|5.0|Five Stars    Defending a King: His Life and Legacy is a remarkable, serious and long-overdue attempt by Dr. Karen Moriarty to explain the unexplainable -- to bring the remarkably rich and full pinnacle life of the `world's greatest entertainer,' Michael Jackson, down-to-earth, to a level of sympathetic comprehension by the common person, working his nine-to-five job, being systematically brainwashed by a media whose only allegiance (by its own admission) is accrual of profit regardless of truth, justice, decency or consequences to its targets and witnessing that life from afar.  In this attempt, Dr. Moriarty is largely successful and, as such, gains my undying gratitude ... for Michael Jackson's is a life beautifully and well-lived, with dignity, grace, style and great love the likes of which this century was unaccountably blessed. His life is an example which must not be overlooked or wasted in deference to greed or reverence to well-established power brokers in the entertainment or publishing industries.    With her background as a clinical psychologist as well as through interviews with those to whom Mr. Jackson turned in some of his darkest, most pain-filled hours, Dr. Moriarty humanizes the man, the entertainer, the unparalleled artist, the humanitarian, the father, the employer, the juggernaut at the head of a billion dollar empire driven by one man's indefatigable energy and perfectionism ... the Gentle Warrior who spoke to interviewers often of wearing rhinoceros skin to protect his beautiful inner core from the cruel barbs of a world which little understood him. She gives an insightful peak into his crippling isolation from common human interaction which most of us take for granted as well as the extraordinary measures he was required to take to cope with the restrictive results of his fame. Her chapters dealing with the 2005 `Trial of the Century' have been expanded in the second edition and new information has been added to the chapter outlining Mr. Jackson's continuing impact upon the world of entertainment and humanitarian outreach. With an in-depth listing of resources used, both in print and on-line, Dr. Moriarty creates a full bibliography for readers wishing more information.    I highly recommend Defending a King: His Life and Legacy by Dr. Karen Moriarty for anyone wishing to understand Michael Jackson's uncommonly productive, extraordinarily prolific life. Five stars, for sure!    Jan Cooper-Carlson  Author of Conversations and Michael: A Short Story  [...]

B000005HLV|5.0|Easily one of the best Black Metal albums ever made.  The atmosphere is chilling, the guitar work on this album is godlike, the drumming is superb, Attila's vocals are great, the version with Dead is also excellent and in some ways superior.  This is an album that redefined a musical style and is an album that can be listed to from start to finish for eons and still keep you interested.  Worth every penny for anyone who actually knows and appreacheats good Black MEtal music.  The negitive reviews here seem to be from people who have no idea what black metal is or is about and try to call it a bad album....they obviously do not know what they are talking about and only look foolish.  Great album.

B004LWZWGK|5.0|I loved this movie. This was a great way to end the great Dark Knight Trilogy. I have to give it up to Christopher Nolan because he single handedly (figuratively speaking of course) proved to all cinema fanatics and critics that creating a great superhero trilogy is possible, if handled with care. What I loved about The Dark Knight Rises is that it tied in all 3 movies together pretty damn well. Some sequels to movies tend to abandon the storylines of the previous film to some extent, but Nolan was able to mesh Batman Begins and The Dark Knight into this new film well enough that it never seemed too forced or irrelevant. The actors for this particular film were chosen perfectly in my opinion; Anne Hathway played an incredibly sexy Catwoman and arguably the best Catwoman ever captured on film, Tom Hardy as Bane was an excellent choice for his strong body and great acting as well, although the voice acting/voice dub has been harshly criticized for it's sound clarity. Joseph Gordan Levitt's character was a personal favorite of mines and his character winded up being significant to story which was a relief.<br /><br />I'm not going to spoil anything about the film, but in it's long running time of 160 minutes, I was surprised to find myself wanting more. To be honest I wouldn't mind if the film was 3 hours long or maybe even a bit longer than that; in fact it should've been because some segments of the movie felt a bit rushed especially the dialogue. However the plot, actors, action and cinematagraphy is some of the best I've seen in 2012 thus far. The only sad part about this movie is that this is indeed the last Dark Knight movie Nolan will be creating, bringing the great trilogy to a sealed close. But all good things must end and this a wonderful way to go out. Fans will always wonder how it could've ended if the late Heath Ledger (The Joker) was still alive, but under the circumstances I don't think Christopher Nolan could've done any better. Buy this movie, and buy the entire trilogy if you haven't seen it, it's worth every penny and every minute of your time. I feel sorry for the the director that decides to reboot the next Batman films, because they have a whole lot to live up to.the entire trilogy if you haven't seen it, it's worth every penny and every minute of your time.

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Within 5 minutes, i realized i finally found a decent game that i didn't necessarily need to purchase things to enjoy.  I started playing last week, couldnt put it down for 2 days straight and am now on level 52. The game is very realistic and fun at the same time. However, i am on level 52, i expected to be able to figure out what the puzzle section is for, currently ive only been able to get 80% of it done, other than that, this is really recommended!!

B004O3YGMC|5.0|I love this app.  It has been great to help my grandparents remotely, and also I use it to remote to my pc.  My only complaint is it sometimes has bad lag for playing online games.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|I highly recommend this amplifier. You don't need a high end headphone to make the best use out of it, I purchased this for my Sennheiser HD 449 which has 32 ohm impedance and it still made a night and day difference.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Charismatic characters, a deep and involving world, and a great story. Overall, a great book that will surelly entertain most readers.
B0058YPILY|4.0|Criminal Minds is one of my favorite series on TV.  I own all seasons through season 7.  All the actors are their characters which makes it seem like watching real life incidents.  Of course, these kinds of things do happen in real life.<br /><br />I just love the show and will continue to do so.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Let me first say...that I've read many romance books since 2009, but I've never read a book that made me such an emotional wreck after reading it, that it took me a few days to calm my nerves before I tempted to type up a review of it. Oh my goodness, Sylvia Day, knows how to make a reader go through an emotional roller coaster in zero point one seconds. ( at least that's how long for me )<br />When I got the email from Netgalley saying I was approved to read \\"Reflected in You\\", early...I scared my family by screaming and jumping up and down like my oldest daughter does when she gets something she absolutely loves.<br />Gideon Cross, how I missed you the last 5 months.<br />While every mom out there is going crazy over the Fifty Shades Trilogy, I've been going crazy over the Crossfire books by Sylvia Day and going gaga over Gideon. *sigh*<br /><br />(Just to let everyone know...no Spoilers here...I want everyone to enjoy the book...because this is a must-read for everyone who loves contemporary erotic romance)<br /><br />\\"Reflected in You\\" picks up where Gideon and Eva left off. Eva has been seeing Gideon at his place and vice versa. She still does not know what to think of what her room mate, Cary has done and she knows something is going on with him.<br />Gideon is having to take a business trip and he wants Eva to go...actually he orders her to go since he can't seem to get enough of her. Of course, Eva needs to have a moment with Cary and come to terms to what he did in their apartment.<br />Gideon agrees to let her go on her own little trip for a weekend with Cary, but with of course with some stipulations...that she must stay in one of his hotels and be protected.<br /><br />Eva is noticing changes with Gideon when they get back from their trip. He keeps acting cold one second and hot the next. She has no idea what is going on, but she knows he's keeping secrets.<br />One of those secrets could evolve her and her past creeping back up to get her.<br /><br />Gideon, plays the domineering, over-bearing, protective, and secretive alpha male again in \\"Reflected in You\\", but he also opens up a bit with some of his secrets on what happened to him and why he is the way he is. He becomes very odd in this book and several times I wanted to beat his butt for Eva because he was acting like a jerk towards her, but then he would throw in, \\"trust him\\", every once awhile, that maybe think, he was up to something. (Seriously, the man made my blood boil second and heart race another second...he was driving me crazy...GRRRR!...but I still loved him).<br /><br />Eva was being her usual self in \\"Reflected in You\\". She was jealous over Gideon's past loves and getting upset with things that Gideon kept doing and she would find out later on the web. There was a time in the book with one of Eva's decisions, that I backed her 110%. She was fed up with Gideon and just wanted to live her life as normal....not with Gideon being cold-hearted and hiding stuff from her. Her family and friends were even worried for her.<br /><br />Sylvia Day didn't disappoint at anything when it came to the sex scenes between Gideon and Eva. (Can I just say...I'm happy to have read that Gideon and Eva went to the Outer Banks in this book...since it's my second home) =) That was the best part of the book when it came to Gideon not getting on my nerves.<br /><br />The ending though, blew my mind and left me wanting more. How could Sylvia, leave me hanging like that. She also answered all my questions that had been bugging me since the beginning.<br />Her writing style is fantastic and flowed really well. If you've read books before that had you keep flipping because you just couldn't get enough...that is how Sylvia's is.<br />Like I stated in the beginning, \\"Reflected in You\\" is a serious roller coaster of emotions.<br />I went from happy, smiling, bawling like a baby, boiling hot from anger, and about to throw down with one certain character in just a few seconds. I'm telling you, in warning so you are prepared ahead of time. Be prepared to have tissues, and be prepared not to bend your book or hit your Kindle a couple of times because you just want to jump in the book and whoop some butt.<br /><br />I'm really looking forward to the final book to the Crossfire Trilogy because there is still plenty of questions to be answered and I want to see if Gideon and Eva will finally have their happily ever after. They both deserve it. Both characters have their own issues. Let's just say Eva's problem gets fixed and Gideon's is just now coming up in the story.<br /><br />All I can say is...this book made me LOVE Gideon even more. How could anyone resist, one sexy, billionaire, twenty-eight year old who owns half of Manhattan (at least that is how Eva describes him and I have to agree with her). *sigh*<br /><br />Now if only it could be December already so I can have my final fix of Gideon. =)elling you, in warning so you are prepared ahead of time.

0525953728|5.0|An honest and thoughtful  account of what really happened. Very exciting telling of what the Seals do. I couldn't put the book down until I finished it. It certainly is woirth reading
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I loved it! it kept my attention and was worth more tgan i paid!! cant wait until the second part!
B008GVD6D8|5.0|I had to walk around the block a couple of times while reading this so intense so passionate book.  Sylvia has portrayed gideon and eva's personalitys so profoundly.  I was there in the room in the car everywhere.  They are two gigantic personalities.  Loved it.  READ IT.
B003V2HWP0|5.0|A most wondrous movie, my ultimate favorite love story yet. I want to purchase the DVD but find it prohibitive and VHS is no longer available? If I have the DVD I would see it over and over again. Casting is superb and what more can I say, I just LOVE this movie.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|I read all of this series several times over as a young man - as well as the pelucidor stuff from burroughs.  The movie breaks quite a bit from the book, transforms later series elements and includes them.  The acting as is so much the trend today is not at all true to the books but much more 21st century punk attitude (look at me, I'm great, I'm sexy and I know it - blah blah blah).  I hate that \\"swagger\\" that's injected into every movie of the last decade or so and seems to be the trend.  That belongs if you are a narcissistic ass or a pirate and in nothing else.  That was the only serious detraction from the film.  Some of the changes were updated to take into account more of modern science, and sci fi conjunctions.  Edgar had no good way to tell us HOW John Carter made his journeys to and from Mars or any reason why he would suddenly make the journey (in the books).  So we are given more of a realistic foundation for this.  The film maker was influenced by the John Carter comic books.  That's likely where the swagger injection comes from as that tends to be the case in comic books.  Over all though it was well done and it was great to FINALLY see this concept on the big screen.  I have no idea what took so long as this has got to be one of the most iconic series ever written.
B005LAIHE0|3.0|This review is going for what the other reviews, which would take 5 years to read, didn't say.<br />Yes it did seem longer than Dr. Zhivago.  No it won't make you laugh out loud (well, once in<br />a while I DID, but then, I'm easy).  This movie uses as theme songs the LESS WELL LIKED<br />Van Morrison songs.  Either this director was working hard at low expectations, or this is a<br />new form of uber-snobbishness.  Besides, how many of the audience will actually know both<br />Van Morrison and Wham! (?)  Perhaps it IS all a social psychology experiment designed to make<br />you, the audience, feel like you are no more in control of your life than the main characters<br />in the movie are, and that's the message.  Dramatic peak of the film: Jason Segel's impassioned<br />donut speech.  Most prolongued cute scene: the two sisters arguing in Elmo and Cookie Monster<br />voices.  Emily Blunt is very cute; Jason still has his man-boy thing going on.  Watch the<br />movie and all of this will make sense.  It's OK but it helps to lower you expectations going into it.
0316228532|2.0|not a reader of Harry Potter...thought I'd try Casual Vacancy....I think the reviewer who wrote she'd rather drink drain cleaner has it just right...I have read more than half this depressing, miserable tome and just can't go any further.  What a disappointment---The publisher should provide tranquilizers...or good stiff drinks...or just tell the eager buyers....it's dark, dreary, depressing...
B006O2QNOU|5.0|Well done movie.  The theme of the movie is very close to what happened in the mortgage lending market.  Well worth watching. Kevin Spacey is excellent as usual.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Ken Follett's latest novel is breathtaking. His early chapters on pre-Nazi Germany and the rise of the Hitler regime are gut-wrenching in their brutally realistic depiction of one of history's most shameful periods. We (take turns reading aloud to each other) have not finished the book yet, but we grab and read from this sure-to-be-bestselling novel every single moment we have available. Ken Follett is the Master and the Master has returned.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I have never written a book review , and I supppose that's shameful considering I've read a bizillion romance novels, but some of the reviews of this book irked me enough, so here goes.<br />First, The Crossfire Series is nothing like Fifty Shades. Did I dig that series? Yep. It was an enjoyable read; however, I feel like many believe that this whole dominant men or BDSM phenomenon started with that book. Uhhh, without naming some other the most masterful writers of erotic romance and straightup eroticism, I think many of those writers are probably appalled.<br />I'm happy that James has gotten a kick start into the romance party, but lump Sylvia Day into that? As a secondary? You're out of your flippin' mind.<br />Ms. Day has been writing for years--and I've been reading--, and if anyone actually reads her other novels, you'll find that she is not a copy cat; she is a forefront romance writer, a master at developing character, conflict, and great sex scenes.<br />Reflected in You is phenomenol. As much as those two characters were addicted to each other, we, the readers, are addicted to them.<br />Masterful...delectable...and I want more. Can't wait for the third in the series.
B006HGXGWU|2.0|Simple-minded guy dreams about storms. Preoccupied, he builds a shelter and hides, losing his job and savings and the respect of his family and friends in the process. Is he psychic?

But I just saved you two hours of your life that you can spend more constructively. You're welcome.
B0038YWPZS|5.0|Released 8 months after Patrick Swayze's death, this new Limited Keepsake Edition is the overall best release, especially for a fan like me. To start with, the twenty-five page Keepsake Book was beautifully filled with pictures, quotes, bios of the actors, a pop quiz, lyrics to the Kellerman's Anthem, and a forward from writer and co-producer Eleanor Bergstein. More pictures are featured on the case when you open to find the two discs. The opening menu takes you back to the movie before you ever hit play.<br /><br />On Disc 1 are the basic features such as Set Up, Scene Selections, and Special Features, but while the second disc has more don't think these special features aren't worth watching or the commentaries aren't worth listening to because they are. You can watch the movie with or without the commentary, but there are two different commentaries and both are great to listen to. You can also watch the movie with the trivia track that has interesting tidbits about the movie that pop onto the screen as you watch the movie. The special features are interesting, especially finding out more details about how they made the film in Kellerman's: Reliving the Locations of the Film. The Rhythm of Dancing is a documentary with Patrick Swayze that he did before his death. Dirty Dancing: The Phenomenon is more about how one movie became one of the biggest movies of all time.<br /><br />On Disc 2 it features so many extras that you'll spend hours going through every feature from the Dance Sequences to the Tributes, which made me cry. When you hit In Memoriam it features a lovely montage remembering Jerry Orbach, Jack Weston, Max Cantor, Emile Ardolino, and of course Patrick Swayze. They feature three separate tributes to Jerry Orbach (narrated by Kelly Bishop). A tribute to Patrick Swayze as told by brother Donny Swayze, wife Lisa Niemi, Eleanor Bergstein, Kenny Ortega, and Miranda Garrison. A tribute to Emile Ardolino as told by Eleanor Bergstein, Miranda Garrison, Kenny Ortega, with Jennifer Grey, and Luis Rodriguez. Another feature Dirty Dancing with Patrick Swayze is a must see documentary Patrick Swayze did before his death. Three music videos are featured on this disc: I've Had The Time of My Life, Hungry Eyes, and She's Like The Wind which are definitely take you back to 1987. There is also some funny outtakes and much much more!<br /><br />I can't say enough about this release; it is truly the best gift for a Dirty Dancing fan!!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Don't take my word for it.  Just read the book.  I have so much  respect for the Men and Women who put their lives on the line so I can be free.  This book was incredible.
B001CC7PP8|1.0|Psycho is one of my all time favorite Alfred Hitchcock movies. Having said that I have to say I was disappointed with this 2008 Legacy Series Special Edition. In 1998 Universal released a Psycho Collector's Edition (which is $5 cheaper) which compared to the 2008 release has a different format (a better format I think), the same bonus features as this new release, the only difference is the Collector's Edition is NOT a two disc set. Obviously I had the 1998 Collector's Edition prior to buying this one. I thought this newer one would be better, its not. I expected more for my money. The DVD is already $19.70 + $2.98 = $22.68 and for what? Basically you're paying more money for a 2nd disc. Save $5 and buy the one from 1998.<br /><br />Don't believe me? Open a new window and search Amazon for Psycho Collector's Edition and compare that one to the Legacy Series Special Edition on this page. Judge for yourself.

B008XG1X18|5.0|i got this app for my kindle fire. only two problems iv ever had with it is, the app will sometimes freeze when going into it, and the amount of time I spend on pinterest. when they say you can easily stay up till 3 in the morning on pinterest, they aren't nodding. this app should get a one star because you can end up spending a lot of time on it. but there are so many categories, lots of information, the humor is so fun. if your a tween, teen, or any other age woman there are great ideas in the women's section. this

B008673ZAQ|4.0|First and foremost let me say I was not disappointed and could not put this second book down.  The heat between Gideon and Eva was scorching at times and smoldering at others.  Character development was ok - Eva seemed a bit more desperate and intense whereas Gideon was cold and distant. Not until I read to the very bitter end did I realize why.  The dark turn this book took in the last quarter surprised and unsettled me - of course making me wish the third book was out NOW !!!  Dare I say I may like Gideon a bit better than the infamous Mr. Christian Grey !!!  He is a complex man - I wish we were given just a little bit more about his past - I left wanting more.<br />Job well done Ms. Day !!!
B000I3PERS|5.0|I have no complaints. Product arrived on time and had no flaws. I feel like I received what I paid for.
B002M87V0A|5.0|Excellent performances, glorious direction. This is a true American classic and Robert Preston's transformation from the stage role to the film is flawless. Overflowing with vivid characters and that Meredith Willson music is nothing short of outstanding. And I love the series of musical \\"tricks\\" he uses in the score. For instance, \\"76 Trombones\\" and \\"Goodnight, My Someone\\" are the exact same melodies with different rhythm and meter. Lot's more of that kind of thing in this score. Now in blu-ray is heaven with that gorgeous scenery and art direction.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Headphones were exactly as advertised.  Brand new, still in the box and in perfect condition.  I have used them everyday since they arrived.  They are exactly what I wanted, and exactly what I needed.  I recommend this seller.

B005OJTVAW|1.0|I ordered this cover with the intention of using it with my new Kindle Fire HD and it is not wide enough. Very frustrating.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I don't know about the others but I haven't had but a couple of hiccups on the Pinterest app. And those were all after I left their site. I give it a 4 because it could be a little easier but overall I enjoy this app daily.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|All I can say is WOW.  I really loved \\"Bared to You\\" and could not wait for the sequel.  Ms. Day did not disappoint.  Gideon and Eva take you on an emotional roller-coaster.  I found myself getting mad at Eva for being neurotic and at times immature and I could not believe the bone head Gideon had become.  That made their characters a little less likable. Gideon is a little much of everything in this book which is a little questionable to me. But once you read the entire book you start see how it all ties in.  Their love for one another is desperate, co-dependent and Ms. Day does a great job sweeping you up in their emotions.  Although there was some other characters brought into this book I think I would like to have seen more of Eva's tormentor come to light.  He is in the book but he was treated more like an afterthought.<br />The sex wow, wow and more wow once again Ms. Day did not disappoint.  It is hot and steamy and a bit voyeuristic.  Some people like it and some people don't.  The hotter the better I always say.<br />People like to draw comparisons to this book to 50 Shades but they are very different.  What they have in common is a young, brilliant, handsome as hell, billionaire with a tortured past who has control issues.  Sounds a lot like Christian Grey but that's it. The female lead characters are like night day.<br />Now I would have given this book 5 stars but their are 2 elements of this book that is holding me back.  One is the lack of Eva's Nathan.  He is the reason she is messed up in the first place. The other element is the ending.  I am sitting on the fence about that one.  Probably more off than on.  I am not going to spoil it for anyone although I see people have.  I will still buy the last book in this trilogy because it will be interesting to see what else can happen to this volatile couple. It was very entertaining and HOT and hard to put down. I am a big fan of the romance genre and I think this certainly worth a read. This one will be atough act to follow but I think Ms. Day will pull it all together.
0316212377|5.0|\\"Is it true your body was covered in over a hundred penises?\\"<br />\\"No. I think the most I ever had was about sixty, but that was slightly too many. I settled on fifty-three as the maximum. Even then it was very difficult maintaining an erection in all of them at the same time, even with four hearts.\\"<br /><br />Iain M. Banks's latest Culture novel is representative of almost everything that has made the series so great. There's enlightened interference, hedonism, spectacular setpieces, diversely characterized Minds, space battle, black humor, and outlandish foolishness (see the above quote). The book, like Surface Detail and Matter, is packed with detail from Banks's imagination, yet avoids the pacing and bloat issues that those two books suffered from.<br /><br />The Culture, for those who don't know, is a post-scarcity civilization which features in many of Banks's sci-fi novels. One of its most notable features are its Minds, wildly powerful AIs with colorful names such as Smile, Tolerantly and Pressure Drop.<br /><br />Similar to Excession, it's the Minds who take center stage. The Gzilt, an advanced humanoid civilization which almost joined the Culture way back when, are about to sublime. To sublime is to enter a sort of transcendent existence in another dimension, where the scope of your understanding and enjoyment can expand to levels unthinkable in the `Real.\\" 23 days before the Gzilt's big day, an alien ship arrives bearing a somewhat controversial secret. The ship is destroyed, and ever curious Culture Minds opt to tackle the crisis. Vyr Cossont, a somewhat irreverent and obsessive artist on a `life-task' to master the nearly unplayable `Hydrogen Sonata,' finds herself on a mission to meet up with QiRia, the Oldest Man in the Culture, who may be able to shed some light on the aforementioned secret.<br /><br />In Excession, an elite group of Culture Minds collaborated to deal with a potentially galaxy threatening event. Here, the Minds are amusingly awarethat their mission could end up completely pointless, yet they interfere anyway. The word `matter' is somewhat of a buzzword in this novel (ironically, it's probably used more than in Matter). Does the Culture's interference matter? Does the Truth matter? Does it matter whether or not we're in a simulation? Do civilizations matter? Does anything matter?  Different characters, from a previously sublimed Mind to QiRia himself, offer interesting perspectives. The result is that Banks provides some thought provoking commentary on the nature of meaning in an ancient galaxy populated by thousands of civilizations only minor blips in the scale of history.<br /><br />But it's not all philosophy. This is a very fun book, from the setpieces to the humor. The Minds are as funny and witty as ever. I don't want to describe any of the more remarkable settings, as to do so would lessen the impact of reading about them for the first time. Banks's imagination is in full force here, and once again he delivers on a satisfying climax which takes place against a wonderfully weird background.<br /><br />The characters are satisfying, even if none are as great as Zakalwe in Use of Weapons. It's the Minds, notably Caconym and Mistake Not..., as well as QiRia, who stand out as great creations. Cossont is an interesting figure with a compelling backstory, but her role as a protagonist becomes less important when the Culture Minds really start to drive the action. Banstegeyn, an antagonist, doesn't achieve the heights of villainry that Veppers of Surface Detail does, but in some ways he's a more compelling, if less cool, character, more prone to guilt and self-doubt. There's also an android whose continued delusion that they're in a simulation provides some funny moments.<br /><br />The plot wraps up nicely, reflecting many of the book's themes. The Hydrogen Sonata really delivered on what I want in a Culture novel: a compelling story, richly written Minds, sense of wonder settings, big ideathemes, and some laugh out loud moments.
B009B2U73I|5.0|I can see why this is getting mixed reviews. If you are looking for same old Diana, this is not it. But what it is, is excellent! You can tell she is having fun with these songs and as with her other albums, puts that Diana Krall magic on it, making the songs her own! Can't wait to see her perform these live!
B0084IG7KC|5.0|Great movie.  Stuck to the book closely but didn't go over board with the gruesome killing.  The only character I didn't like was the one played by Lenny Kravitz - he was supposed to be a best friend and mentor.  Did not like this choice.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|Excellent  book keeps you glued to the pages endless twists and a truly unexpected ending! Thrill to read  keeps you wanting more!
B002M9WW30|5.0|I bought this after I read some of the mixed reviews on here & decided to get it to not only decide for myself wether i like this or not but it was on sale & it was an anthology I had always wanted but thought it was a little to pricey for $60 so when I saw it for half price I thought I had to get it. Now, a lot of people complained of a grainy or blurred picture. I guess it is a little grainy if you look close for it but it's an old movie, you know? You're not gonna get a picture like say a movie that came out a year ago or something. I've seen the first 3 & I don't really see what the big deal was about all the complaints. And of course the movies themselves are just awesome. Would definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys Rocky movies

Music made me happy though their were no mint juleps to be made that day...life is still good.

0978545095|4.0|If you love Vivian Maier's work, you'll want this book. The photographs are beautifully reproduced and the authors have gathered the most details about Maier's life we have to date in their biography of her.<br /><br />So why four stars instead of five? As wonderful as this book is, this collection of Maier's photographs doesn't impress me quite as much as the ones in John Maloof's book, \\"Vivian Maier: Street Photographer\\", despite the fact that the reproduction quality of the latter isn't as good. There's a higher percentage of really stunning work in Maloof's book, and those are the photographs that really made Maier an overnight sensation (albeit posthumously). I'm sure a lot of that is attributable to the fact that Maloof is in possession of over 100,000 of Maier's photographs, whereas the Jeffrey Goldstein Collection, which is the source for this book, consists of 20,000 images. Maloof had the luxury of choosing from a much larger stash, and it shows.<br /><br />But don't get me wrong, the photographs in this book are terrific, and this book richly deserves a place in any serious collection of photography monographs. Someday, after Maloof and Goldstein are finally finished cataloging all of Vivian Maier's prodigious output, we may be lucky enough to get a huge multi-volume retrospective that comprises both collections. In the meantime, this and the Maloof book are the ones to own.
0316228532|1.0|From Harry Potter to this???? I don't understand.  This must be the first time in over 20 years where I broke my  steadfast rule of always finish a book once it's started.  I just couldn't do it with this book.  It was too painful.  There wasn't a story, just one chapter after another describing one of the many pathetic characters who was \\"flawed\\" in one way or another.  It just became a chore to even open the book.  I hear enough of this kind of thing on the news.  Do I really need to read about it in a fictional book too?  I was hoping for a book that drew me into its world and I would want to find out more because I was concerned about each character.  This book was the polar opposite.  I couldn't care less about any of these whiny, shallow, maddening characters.  I wanted so much to love this book because it's J.K. Rowling for goodness sake!  Sadly, I tried my best, but I couldn't even get through half of it before I decided that I'd rather be sorting socks than continue with this book.  Sorry!
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Purchased while traveling in Spain. Great read for plane ride, engaging, educational, interesting. The personal stories interwoven in the historical events make it easy to read. Lots of characters challenge me to keep track on who everyone is and how it all fits together. I highly recommend.

I will be purchasing the full version soon. it's that good! this is the only app i have ever taken the time to review... it rocks.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|Phew! That was a rough read, and completely not what I expected. Reflected in You gives a whole new meaning to a roller coaster ride. I liked some parts of it and was frustrated with most of them. But lets get something straight first, I LOVE EVA TRAMELL. She is the sole reason for me liking this book. She's unbelievable strong, and I can't even imagine being in her shoes. Hat's off to you for putting up with such an unreasonable, and extremely secretive person; I would have gone mad, and even changed my state with all the mind games that were happening.<br /><br />  Reflected in You starts off where Bared to You ended. Eva & Gideon are together, and every thing is going well, but their is still some tension because of Gideon's unwillingness to share his past with Eva. I absolutely loved Bared to You, and I'm still wondering where things went off in this one. The first half of the book was brutal to read. There were so many (maybe bazillion) arguments between the couple, and the worst part about it was that they were never resolved. They fight then have sex, and it repeats all over again. It made me frustrated, and annoyed to a point where I couldn't take it anymore. I hated when they had sex because it was for all the wrong reasons. And what the hell happened to Gideon Cross? He turned from my wet dream to my absolute horrible nightmare. He character became very weird, and the things he said were not sexy. By the end of the novel he opened up a bit, so hopefully things would change for the better now.<br /><br />  The things that worked for me in this book was Cary, and the other guy. Obviously, there is not going to be a love triangle, but I loved that the author introduced him when she did. He was there to shake things up between Gideon & Eva, and it turned the book around for me. I wish we'll see more of him; he was very interesting and competitive.*Thumbs up for that*. From thereon, the book was really good, and very suspenseful. I liked it very much. My favorite part was when Eva took control of her life, and I just wanted to kiss her at that moment. And who can forget her best friend Cary? He was so adorable, and such a good friend. He stuck with Eva through all the rough patches, and respected her wishes. I absolutely loved him, and am very eager to know where his love life is headed.<br /><br />  The ending was shocking yet expected. It still didn't justify a lot of the actions that were taken, and I wasn't very satisfied with it. There are numerous unanswered questions, and unreasonable actions that are yet to be explained. Overall, it was a very rough yet enjoyable read. I don't know where the story is headed, and I think that's a really good thing. I makes me wonder if the couple will finally have a HEA. I wish they would; individually they are a very wrong, but together they somehow make it work. Reflected in You is the second book in the Crossfire trilogy, and is recommended to all the people who devoured Bared to You & love heroins that can kick some ass.te part was when Eva took control of her life, and I just wanted to kiss her at that moment.

0553807919|1.0|This book, although had some great ideas was difficult to read and retain the information.  By the end I was so confused about what tantrum was right brained, left brained, upstairs, downstairs, vertical and horizontal.  I think a little more \\"Story Telling\\" and less science would have been more helpful.  However I am a right brained person (or am I left???) who prefers to learn in a different way than this book is written.  This book might be good for you if you are inclined to be more technical and efficient.  I am creative and found this book not so helpful.
B0058SNI94|5.0|I love my new crocs. They are made of thick rubber/plastic and are made to fit your foot like a glove. You can wear these anywhere rain or shine. They will last forever! My daughters both adore crocs and my oldest is big enough to share this pair with so its important that they hold up since they will see twice the amount of wear and tear. I paid $28 for these and shipping was included so the price wasn't spectacular. But its average for these shoes and we don't have any complaints!

1469240580|5.0|Much better than the movie which was also good. I liked the radio theater type performance, it kept my attention over a long driving trip. Also much cheaper than the Audible version.
030758836X|2.0|What more can I say without including spoilers?  Predictable.  From about 1/4 of the way in it was obvious what had happened to the victim.  And after that was finally made part of the story,it was obvious what would happen at the end and how the protagonist would get his/her way in the end.  Suffering through the whining of the two main characters page after page after interminable page, I hoped for something to justify all the great reviews.  Yes, it had an intricate plot, and one twist that wasn't really integral to the main story line, but no surprises.  I do like to have someone to root for, someone likeable in my entertainment, some satisfaction at the outcome.  Two thumbs down! I'm angry that I wasted so much time on this book!!!
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|This futuristic adventure is very exciting and kept me rivited to the action throughout.  This movie is NOT for small children and may be not well suited for some teens.  There is a a lot of blood, killing, but the characters are beliveable and was well worth the money.<br /><br />It was extremely easy to access on Amazon pay per view and the HD quality was outstanding.  And a whole lot cheaper than spending $40 at the theater.
0545265355|5.0|My first introduction to the Trilogy was the movie; I had not even heard of the books and had completely missed out on any discussion generated by the books. When the movie came out then even I couldn't help hearing about \\"The Hunger Games.\\" I resisted seeing the movie in theaters and finally rented the movie on streaming video and watched it once and then watched it again; I now have the Blu-ray version of the movie and expect to buy the final two when they are released.<br /><br />I was captivated by the movie, the characters and the story and immediately ordered this boxed set of the Trilogy. I am a book collector and love books; I love their feel and their smell and enjoy seeing them sitting on the shelves of one of our many bookcases. Therein, of course, is the problem, they take up space; space I don't begrudge them because they are like old friends waiting to be discovered again.<br /><br />\\"The Hunger Games Trilogy\\" is now one of my new best friends and I recommend it highly to all those brave enough to consider the dangers posed by a totalitarian dictatorship. Since the set came in after I had watched the movie I started reading Book 2, \\"Catching Fire,\\" immediately. I had decided I would read books 2 and 3 then go back and read Book 1; I was very curious what was going to happen to Katniss and the others. One good thing about books 2 and 3 is they each pick up where the preceding book left off; just as if they were the next chapter, which, in a sense, they are.<br /><br />The story is not complete in any one book; it takes all three to tell the story of Katniss and the others, their bravery and determination in the face of what appears to be overwhelming odds against them. The major characters are all from District 12, one of the poorer districts in a dictatorship called Panem, an area once called North America. District 12 includes what had been called Appalachia and is the source of Panem's supply of coal, an important energy source.<br /><br />District 12 had once been part of a revolt against \\"The Capitol\\" which resulted in their enslavement along with the other 11 districts. There had been a District 13 but it had been destroyed during the revolt and no longer existed. In Book 1, \\"The Hunger Games,\\" the reader is introduced to the general situation in Panem and is told the story of a tool used by the dictatorship to control the enslaved peoples of the 12 districts, a so-called game in which young people between the ages of 12 and 18 are drafted each year, one boy and one girl from each district, to compete to the death in a controlled environment which would be in Book 1, the 74th annual Hunger Games contest. The winner would receive rewards and privileges for themselves and their districts for one year following their victory.<br /><br />In Book 2, \\"Catching Fire,\\" the story of the unintended consequences resulting from the 74th annual Hunger Games begins to complicate life for the dictatorship who decides steps must be taken to correct the situation. Each 25 years a special feature is added to the games to excite the jaded interests of the spectators from \\"The Capitol.\\" In Book 2 that special twist seems to offer an opportunity to both entertain and bring resolution to the growing problem faced by the dictator, President Snow.<br /><br />In Book 3, \\"Mockingjay,\\" there is further development of an unexpected hope first revealed in Book 2 and things start to get very difficult in Panem. This is the book of the revolution and with this book final resolution is achieved for the moment. In each book the scale of the action grows until the exciting final battle is revealed which sets the stage for the new Panem.<br /><br />These are exciting stories and have earned an honored place in my collection of fantasy and science fiction. One last plus for the collector; these are all hardback first editions.2 had once been part of a revolt against \\"The Capitol\\" which resulted in their enslavement along with the other 11 districts.

B004LWZWGK|1.0|Rated 1 star for no iTunes DC. Stop it WB. Stop. UV sucks. I repeat. UV sucks. Why WB? Why?
B008EKON56|5.0|I bought this to hook my iPod up to my new Sennheiser closed earphones to use at work.  Since I am a musician I wanted to try out the USB dock for an upgrade in sound quality over the earphone plug.  It really does make a difference.  The acoustical definition is far better, so that I can actually keep the volume lower and still enjoy the musical experience. No need to pound your eardrums to create a sonic environment that is satisfying.
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|No idea what anyone sees in this... pretty boring and you have to wait all the time unless you want to buy more coins. Dumb game. Uninstalled
0307477401|2.0|An unfortunate final installment in one of my favorite series. (Sort of spoilery things follow) I will allow Mankell the abrupt and heartbreaking final few pages because it certainly had an effect. And I forgive the ridiculous central idea that Sweden was an important epicenter of cold war intrigue. So everyone spied on everyone, who didn't know that? It was the bland writing and slow pace with no reward that undermined the book. I quit reading for a month after the first 100 pages out of boredom. I finally slogged through the rest of the book hoping it would get better. It never did. If this is the only Wallander book you have read don't judge the series by it. And as much as I like the PBS series there is much more life in the books because when he goes all taciturn on the people around him we still get to hear what he is thinking. Oh and if you didn't read \\"The Pyramid\\" because it is made up of short stories (like a friend of mine told me), I suggest you pick it up. It is a delight.
B008QE9VJI|4.0|\\"The heart wants what the heart wants.  Even if that heart is no longer beating,\\" might be the theme of this very funny film by Tim Burton.<br /><br />I used to watch the original series on TV when I was a kid.  And I was hooked, especially when the Barnabas Collins character was introduced.  I tried to watch this series again recently when streaming for it became available, and realized that in reality, the series itself wasn't all that great.  It wasn't really scary enough, and it wasn't really campy enough.  The mistake that they made with the series:  they needed to go one way or the other and they tried to have it both ways, and I believe that it succeeded ultimately at neither.<br /><br />But Mr. Burton didn't make that mistake.  He decided to mostly take the campy route, and in my opinion, it works.  The spirit of the early 70s was recreated here as well, so that worked.  And the overall acting was very good as well, particularly by Johnny Depp and his nemesis.  But I believe that the writing was the strongest point in this film, since movies such as \\"Dark Shadows\\" either succeed or fail based upon writing.  Comedic timing by the actors is also important, and I believe that the actors succeeded in that regard.  In particular, there is a scene where an entire Carpenters song is played that is very clever and funny, especially if you're a fan of that excellent group that disbanded too young.<br /><br />One other item that worked as well:  the special effects.  There is a lot of CGI here, and in a lot of films, the CGI just isn't quite believable.  In \\"Shadows,\\" differentiating between what is fantasy and what is real is difficult, which is quite a feat.<br /><br />Pretty big recommendation by me for a film that the critics panned, for some odd reason.  Maybe too many of those critics were too young to have seen the original series, and therefore don't realize that the film is actually better?
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I really like this movie.  Lots of drama, very suspenseful, good acting.  Love Jennifer Lawrence, Stanley Tucci,  and Woody Harrelson.  The cinematography is fabulous!  Definitely recommend this movie.

I loved the charactors and his way of<br />  discribing them just puts you right in the book like<br />  you are there. Just good clean rading.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This book is a great compliment to the Fall of Giants. It gives the reader a feeling of the events in Germany and the rise of Hitlers horrible programs.
B002RI9ZUE|2.0|I probably wouldn't recommend this book to lovers of fiction. There is no \\"plot\\" as such- the story unfolds in a fly-on-the-wall manner. You're simply observing a series of events (I use this word loosely) that may or may not have any significance. Was this done on purpose? I'm sure folks will say so. But as a result, for much of the book I felt bored, wondering when something would \\"happen\\". Apparently I missed the purpose of this book until I neared the end. The book doesn't serve any purpose other than to have you tag along on a journey.<br /><br />I fail to see how this book became such a classic. I imagine it's much the same as those posh people in the fine art world who crowd around a painting of nonsensical splatters and \\"Ooh & Ahh\\" over its hidden meanings. I'm sure that more literary types will point out how Esther was a model of the feminist movement, the issues of mental health care, and the conservative beliefs of the time. But all these points were breezed over in passing, and failed to tweak anything inside me. There was no impact, no revelation. It seemed like whenever Plath had the opportunity to create some great moment with the reader, she shrugged and turned her back.<br /><br />Is this a captivating tale of real depression? To anyone who hasn't suffered from mental illness, I'm sure this book would have left them as clueless as before. Certainly it's apparent to fellow sufferers that Plath (Esther) has a big problem with mental illness. Detachment from the world, lack of consequence, suicidal thoughts in a very passive manner... these are all things I'm intimately familiar with. But this was just another thing that rubbed me the wrong way. If not to open the eyes of \\"normal\\" folk, what was the point of this book?<br /><br />In that sense, this book felt very self-indulgent. Plath seemed to care very little about the reader's experience. Any opportunity to expand on a concept or leave an impression on the reader was ignored. It seems that Plath simply wrote this book as a journal of sorts, but without the usual deep and personal insights.<br /><br />For such a personal book, Plath was remarkably successful at distancing her readers. And for that reason, I just can't recommend this book. Will there be folks who think this is a masterpiece? No doubt. I'll let them \\"Ooh & Ahh\\" over the paint splatters while I go and admire the works of the Renaissance.<br /><br />Edit: I should clarify that I'm perfectly aware that this was a personal work (thus the \\"lack of care about the reader's experience\\") and that it was Plath's family who published this book after her death. But given the above points, I feel that this is one of those works that should have remained private. Was this just a money making venture?mply wrote this book as a journal of sorts, but without the usual deep and personal insights.<br /><br />For such a personal book, Plath was remarkably successful at distancing her readers.

1401322786|1.0|I had high hopes for this, although I haven't read this author before.  In my opinion, this book seemed like it was written by a kid.  It was very unsophisticated.  I kept waiting for something to ring true (I know it's fiction) but I couldn't relate to any of it.  It was childish, and the author didn't seem to put a whole lot of thought to it.<br /><br />I usually love anything to do with time-travel, things like that.  But, as I said, it was a complete waste of my time.  And to top it off, it was almost considered a short story, the book was so short.
0439023521|5.0|\\"And may the odds be ever in your favor.\\"  Whether you are interested in finding out what this book means or you are just interested in finding a good new book to read, you're in the right place.  The Hunger Games, by Suzanne Collins, hyped up beyond belief was, to my great surprise, one of the best books I have ever read.  Finishing it in two days, I could not put it down.<br /> There are 723 people on the holding list at the library, just for three weeks of \\"the book of the decade!\\"  Within a month of coming out The Hunger Games made millions of dollars.  It surpassed both classics, Harry Potter and Twilight.  When the movie came out a year later, fans screamed for it, newspapers wanted a glimpse at it, and before the midnight premiere, it was almost as loud and crowded as a sold out One Direction concert.  EVERYONE had watched it within two weeks of the premiere.  It was about the only topic of everyone's conversations at school for weeks.<br /> In this popular favorite, you'll find action with a bit of romance.  The United States, now called Panem with twelve districts and a Capitol, hold an annual televised event called the Hunger Games.  Two tributes from each district (one boy and one girl from the ages of 12-18) are chosen to compete in a fight to the death.  Katniss, a sixteen year old girl, gets into the Hunger Games along with another boy from her district.  Who will survive?  What will happen?  Will there be a love story involved?  Find out the answers to all these questions by reading this wonderfully written novel.<br /> Looking for great characters? What about creativity or drama and suspense?  All of these are shown in Collins' book, The Hunger Games. The characters are remarkable.  Protecting her family from harm, Katniss Everdeen hunts for her family with her best friend, Gale, in the Seam (the forbidden part of District 12).  The soft, loving girl helping her mother is Prim, whom Katniss loves dearly.  Also living in District 12, there's Peeta, the baker's son, also known as \\"lover boy.\\"  And lastly, there are the people living in the Capitol.  They, to Katniss, look very much fake and plastic.<br /> Collins has a great mind especially when it comes to her imagination and creativity.  How many of you could have thought up the plot and setting that she did.  I mean really! North America in the future - Panem with 13 districts (one getting destroyed by the Capitol) and holding the Hunger Games to keep the other districts from trying to over throw the government ever again.  It's genius.<br /> Going along with her creativity comes all the drama and suspense in this book.  Katniss, one minute strategizing her next move, could be scrambling rapidly trying to escape the fiercest wild fire ever, the next!  Or, concentrating immensely Katniss could be figuring out how in the world she is going to get down from the tree and then the next second worrying about how to survive the tracker jacker attack.<br />Oh, I almost forgot about the romantics of the novel.  Will Katniss fall for best friend or \\"lover boy?\\"  Will this lead them to their ultimate fate or help them survive this crazy journey of the Hunger Games and be the first survivors of the Hunger Games for District 12 in 20 years?<br /> Excited to find out more about everyone's fate?  Well you should be. This awe-inspiring contraption is one of the only hyped up books I actually liked.  Have you finished the first book and thirsty for more?  No problem!  The other books in the series are Catching Fire and Mocking Jay.

B008G12ERC|3.0|If you thumbs down please let me know why, I am interested in your opinions too. Just don't thumbs down because I didn't give it immediately 4 or 5 stars, that is ridiculous.<br /><br />I give it a 3.5 stars, not 3 stars.<br /><br />First off, Wolstenholme, one of my favorite bass players to emulate, has an amazing voice. It's not the voice of Muse though; the two songs he wrote, I believe, should have been released separately from The 2nd Law. Other artists that have done similar things, (i.e. Flea, Serj Tankian) released their own works separately under their name, not under their main bands' name.<br /><br />I am glad Muse is experimenting, I would not want to be hearing songs that sound like Showbiz and Muscle Museum over and over again. The polarity of change in The 2nd Law in relation to their last albums seems greater than their previous steps in progression. What I mean is, the change in Showbiz to Origin of Symmetry seemed proper, along with the other steps they took leading to The Resistance. The change from The Resistance to The 2nd Law is beyond obvious; if you showed these two albums to someone new to Muse, would they be able to tell it is the same band?<br /><br />Ask yourself this, would you want this to be the first album of Muse to show to someone who has never listened to Muse before?<br /><br />I love Undisclosed Desires and I like Follow Me and Madness. But would you rather Muse focus more on this genre of music (this kind of electronic feel)? I guess what I'm trying to say I felt a lack of rock in this album. You can argue that Panic Station is rock, because it is, but it's not about Panic Station, it is about this album's overall feel is so different; it makes me uncomfortable to a degree.<br /><br />With listening to Muse you have to love their soft pieces too. Explorers is a piece I could see going along perfectly with Little Big Planet and one I enjoy listening to. Big Freeze in another song I can relax to; I want to emphasize, I don't hatethis album, it's just different.<br /><br />Another thing, when else have you heard the `F' word used in a Muse album? (You could call them out on the hidden song \\"Hidden Track\\" or \\"YFMF\\", but that song isn't known about by most people and is just for fun) I know this is a minor thing, but this is a surprise seeing this directly on a Muse album.<br /><br />Muse has been in my life ever since discovering this band from Guitar Hero 3, which means I got started on Black Holes and Revelations. I only say I wish I knew this band back in 1999, this band, that I thought was small at the time, slowly rose and became my favorite band and still is to this date.<br /><br />I do not regret buying the deluxe box set to this album, I know the music will grow on me even more with time, but this is how I feel right now. It deviates from their older work too much for real comfort.<br /><br />This isn't much of a review more than an opinion; then again, all reviews are opinions. You have to right to agree or disagree with them; I would definitely love to discuss in the comments what you think about my opinions and the album as a whole to see what you other Musers think of it.
B0058VA2U4|5.0|I've long been a metal fan, but never a fan of Anthrax....until now.<br />While metal may be making a small comeback, most bands seem to be getting by on what they've done in the past, and I've not been excited by much of the new stuff.  So, when a friend suggested that \\"Worship Music\\" was a great disc, I replied by saying, \\"I'm not an Anthrax fan\\".  He replied, \\"me either, until now\\".  And what great advice that was....<br />So, I went out and purchased the CD (and blew the clerks mind when the other disc I bought was Miles Davis....\\"Anthrax, yes!  Ah, Miles?  Never got him.\\")<br />It opens strong, and it pays homage to a ton of metal without being cliché.  I love that they take their time building the intro and outro and every song sounds unique (you listening Hetfield?).  It's often a perfect balancing act of being hard-core while also creating an instant hook--maybe one of the most difficult musical things to execute.  Frankly, I think the first half of the CD can stand with ANY metal classic. Line them up: Metallica, Priest, Maiden, whoever.....  It's just that great.<br />If there is any weakness in the CD it's that, IMO, it fades a bit at the end, but half this CD is better than almost anything available today!  If you like metal, please, I urge you to get this.  I did, and I'm better off for it.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Lots of versions and reading plans available. Haven't been able to utilize video devotionals yet. Otherwise User friendly. Great app.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I got this when it delivered and read it in about 6 hours.  It wasn't really a quick read.  I just simply couldnt put it down. It was also hard to read at times. It tugged at my heart and I smiled and melted with their love. I am on a countdown until the 3rd installment and cant wait to read it. The scenes in this book are hot.<br /><br />Gideon runs hot and cold and more so in this book. Eva cant make up her mind what she is going to do.  Then the ex comes in and all i wanted to do was hit Gideon.  Then I wanted to smack Eva for going along with it and and not staying firm.<br /><br />The plane ride...NO WORDS.<br /><br />Cary well he is still Cary.<br /><br />The plane ride...still no words<br /><br />I liked it better than Bared To You.  This Crossfire series is a must have.
B0079R8KXG|1.0|My cover that I justed ordered for my kindle fire does not fit. It is too small. I did exactly what the instructions said to do but the device is too big for the cover that I recieved. It will not snap into place.

B009329ZF2|5.0|Great movie, will be watching it again with friends. Comes with both the blu-ray version and DVD version so i'll still be able to watch it on one of the TV's in the house with only a DVD player.

B0087JTAKW|1.0|The Story is very slow and really makes no sense? I would not recommend this book to anyone! Don't waste your money on this book!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I stayed up until 1am reading this book. I couldn't sleep until I knew where things stood with Gideon and Eva! I laughed, I cried, and I sat in silence through the course of reading it. It was such an emotional roller coaster. This book took some twists and turns that I wasn't expecting. A great read! I'm curious to see how everything is concluded in the last book. I can't wait until December when it is released!!!!
B0051BVQFG|5.0|It's not a give away when I tell you this is about alien invaders and a marine unit involved in the fight.  Yes, the plot is a little on the preposterous side but this film does what it does very well.  It is anhour and a half or so of good entertainment.  The marines are awesome and there is plenty of explosions.  There also is some pretty good acting.  Don't confuse this with Battle for Los Angeles which was a huge disapointment. There really are very few slow moments in this film.  The action keeps moving and you really do start to care for the characters.  I especially liked the young lieutenent fresh out of OTS.  There was a real hero.  This movie shows marines in a very positive light.  There's a lot of \\"Hoo-Ray\\" in this film.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for action, decent acting and not a lot to think about.
B005DNPJKU|5.0|I am so pleased to watch this drama, david lynch is a true director.. and I couldn't hold my tears.. it touches human feelings and shape our humanitarian view
B005LAIIA8|3.0|I saw the original Frankenweenie (also by Tim Burton...yea, he remade his own movie) as a kid and liked it. It wasn't amazing and since I had already seen Pee-Wee's Big Adventure, Beetlejuice and Batman also by Tim Burton, this short film didn't blow me away. I liked the star Barret Oliver (D.A.R.Y.L. and The Never Ending Story) and liked that it was filmed in black and white. Since seeing that movie, over the years Tim Burton has made countless movies with Johnny Depp and films scored by Danny Elfman that now seem to be bland reiterations of his own movies, most of which aren't original. This full length feature adaptation of his own short film, is no different. This movie, like Corpse Bride, while looking cool and well done with the signature Tim Burton character design and overall look, is flat and has no charisma. Directors seem to run out of steam and good ideas after working in the business for too long. I don't think Tim Burton has made a decent movie in about 15 years, this bland and typical Tim Burton movie is exactly what you would expect from him anymore, predictable and devoid of originality. The pacing is fine, he did a decent job of adapting his own work, but if you didn't like Corpse Bride, Sweeney Todd, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Alice in Wonderland, or Sleepy Hollow, (which I hated all of those movies) you probably won't like this movie either. Get your hands on the original short film he made in '84, don't give this guy more money to keep ruining other peoples stories and now his own work. Albeit this is just a different version of Frankenstein, and so is Edward Scissorhands. Really, even his best movies aren't original. Tim Burton really shouldn't be making any more movies. This movie will appeal to kids, and since they have to be taken to the theater to see this, it'll make millions and it really shouldn't. It's just not a very captivating or original concept and I can't sit through anymore of Tim Burtons expected art design or subpar Danny Elfman scores. Which is sad, because they both used to be so great. I think it's time to hang up the hats you guys, or maybe take a break to reflect.<br /><br />I think because the typical American audience has become so desensitized to human death in movies, that the death and resurrection of a dog in this movie feels more emotionally involving and heart felt. While I will agree with that sentiment, if you replace Sparky and create say a stranger for Victor to dig up and resurrect, I don't think anyone would really care. Then this movie would more closely resemble the original story of Frankenstein and resurrecting dead people and not pets. This movies sentiments seem to cloud everyone's judgment and perception. Tim Burton took other peoples stories, character and character names, and overall conception and just slapped his signature \\"Tim Burton Style\\" on it. If you like his remakes and adaptations of Sleepy Hollow, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Planet Of The Apes, and Alice In Wonderland, then I think you will probably like this as it is apparent you like his overused style and boring story telling which leans heavily on its visual conception. Tim Burton is all style and no substance, and what little substance he has is other peoples stories. Where this movie is most successful is the animation itself which has nothing to do with Tim Burton. The team of stop motion animators are on par with Nick Parks team who worked on some of his Wallace and Gromit stop motion features which I find far more compelling and entertaining in style and substance when compared to Frankenweenie.<br /><br />The adapted screenplay by John August is very telling to why I feel this movie feels flat to me. He wrote Titan A.E., both Charlie's Angels movies (those are complete crap), Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Corpse Bride and Dark Shadows. Clearly this guy can't write anything original and when paired up with Tim Burton, neither one can think of new stories. I still feel likethe original short film Tim Burton made was superior. I think it worked better as short and live action. I can see why he went with animation, but I think he should have adapted this into live action and made it more like a B grade movie from the 1950's like he did with Ed Wood. Yet that he already did, so it would be like beating a dead horse at this point. Much like most of his movies and his style. This is being advertised as a comedy, I didn't think it was funny. None of the jokes were, and most kids probably won't get the references to older films. The movie is packed full of scientific debate and monster rampage as filler and when trying to say something about messing with the natural order, they screw it up by re-resurrecting Sparky which I thought was a huge disservice to the whole ideal of the concept that things that are dead should stay dead. Clearly they sought the happy ending for kids instead of taking the better direction and keeping the dog dead. Or re-dead. I am ok with people liking it and it is certainly better than his last few movies. But it isn't anywhere close to being as good as his best work from twenty years ago.the original short film Tim Burton made was superior. I think it worked better as short and live action.

B000TGJ7ZY|5.0|Maybe not boasting the cleanest transfer around (which is unfortunate), this movie still does look a lot better on Blu-Ray compared to its many DVD releases. This really is probably the last real Hollywood movie in the sense of effects. The art department used only traditional techniques to accomplish all the effects shots. No CGI was used to accomplish the many effects shots in the movie, it was matte paintings, models and camera tricks. I like that about this movie, it's how they would have made this movie had it been made at the time the book came out (1897), which was the main reason for shooting it this way. While Keanu Reeves performance as well as Winona Ryder's may not be particularly strong (in fact in the case of Keanu, it's actually pretty bad), Gary Oldman and Tom Waits and other supporting cast do a great job. So the movie is shot well, paced well, the effects are done well, Winona Ryder looks great and you get to see a youthful Monica Bellucci very naked in this movie. Hot female nudity is always a plus in a movie for me, but that's because I'm a caveman. This movie was made before things like Twilight came out and ruined the mythos of Vampires by having them play baseball and walking outside during the day. This is traditional Vampirism from one of the first novelized fictional books on the subject. On Blu-Ray, this movie looks good. Not as good as it could, but it's devoid of DNR, retains the natural film grain and although the detail could be sharper, it's still fairly crisp looking. A great movie to watch on the advent of Autumn and one of the best Vampire movies made, certainly one of the best films on Dracula ever made. The special features aren't many, but certainly not missing. There is a great \\"making of\\" where you get to see Gary Oldman and Ford Coppola arguing which is something we rarely get to see, most special features are a bunch of interviews of the stars and filmmakers kissing each other's asses. This is a very affordable movie on Blu-Ray and definitely worth owning.Ray and definitely worth owning.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game...at first I did not understand why all the great reviews, but it sucks you in over time.
B000VNMMQ6|4.0|Not nearly as good as the first Die Hard, but way better than the second and third film. The transfer is exceptional, free of DNR (Digital Noise Reduction) and retaining natural film grain, this movie pops on Blu-Ray. While having some decent special features, my favorite of which is an interview with Bruce Willis where Kevin Smith is asking all the questions, there isn't a lot of supplemental material. If you like action movies that are shot well, or any of the other Die Hard movies, you'll probably like this just fine. Though it isn't even close to being as good as the original. If you want an affordable Blu-Ray that really showcases how good they can look when they are transferred  well, this is a great representation. I saw this in the theater and it looks even better on Blu-Ray than it did when I saw it back in 2007. Maybe not a movie you will watch over and over again, but for mostly mindless action this is pretty good to have on in the background while cleaning or to watch specific scenes again and again for good action and fights, which are easily the strong point of this movie.

0525953728|5.0|No Easy Day is an easy read - took me a bit over 3 hours to read on my kindle. And it's quite compelling with much of it autobiographical as Bissonnette writes about his background, motivation for joining the SEALS, the training, and information about prior missions.<br /><br />Some interesting dilineations/pointers from the book<br /><br />  (1) The SEALS are a close-knit community (but you already knew that)<br />  (2) The author was on the helicopter that crash-landed on the bin Laden  mission, and as it went down, he thought they'd all be killed. Only a great job by the pilot prevented a catastrophe.<br />  (3) Many of the CIA analysts who spent years on the search for bin Laden were women. Bissonnette has an interesting vignette about one of the woman.<br />  (4) The cameras on drones are amazing. The author was in charge of the team that was going to take the guest house. He asked if the front door opened in or out. The analyst said \\"give me a few minutes\\", checked the data and then was able to give him the answer (read the book for the answer).<br />  (5) The SEAL (unidentified, as are all the operatives) who killed bin Laden's son Khalid, also was the one who mortally wounded bin Laden.<br />  (6) Whatever compunction Special Forces operators had about killing people - well they left the compunctions behind and made peace with killing when they joined Special Forces. The author describes his shooting of several people on prior missions, and is clearly personally responsible for the deaths of plenty of \\"bad guys.\\"<br />  (7) Bissonnette and another SEAL put a couple of extra shots into the dying bin Laden \\"he was still twitching and convulsing\\" with blood and brains spilled out.<br />  (8) Bin Laden used \\"Just for Men\\" to cover the gray in his beard.<br />  (9) The SEALs were very concerned that the mission success would help Obama get re-elected.<br /><br />At the end of the kindle edition is a listing of Special Forces men who've lost their lives in various operations, a list of \\"confirming sources\\", and the photos and diagrams that presumably are in the proper places in the hard copy edition (A disadvantage of the kindle edition; I didn't know there were pictures, diagrams and maps until I got to the end. My bad.).<br /><br />I'm glad the author wrote and published this; I can understand the objections, but getting the story out I think is important.operations, a list of \\"confirming sources\\", and the photos and diagrams that presumably are in the proper places in the hard copy edition (A disadvantage of the kindle edition; I didn't know there were pictures, diagrams and maps until I got to the end.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|WOW! This book was way better than the first for sure, and sounded much less like 50 shades. The only thing i'm going to piss and moan about was that it wasn't long enough. Just like every other person who's read this book, it left me wanting more! And i'm glad we won't have to wait too long to get more. PS: if i thought Anastasia Steele was a whiny little brat who truly lucked out on scoring Christian Grey, reading what Eva goes through to fight for the love she and Gideon have for each other just solidified that assumption.

Born To Sing is the opposite and sounds like something in between Back On Top and something he did in the early-mid 80´s.<br /><br />A very interesting record that all fans should check out. Hope to see more from Van.. after all, he truly IS the man ;)
B005ZO6NRA|2.0|Although this probably jibes with the story of Conan, he doesn't have much depth to his character other than a revenge seeking, womanizing warrior.  The film carries little in the way of a good story.  If you're wanna see a bit of gore, this might be an alright movie for you, but other than that, there are a lot better strong, warrior films out there.

B005SZNZAY|5.0|I titled my review \\"Thank You\\" because that's what Chris Cornell says at the end of just about every song on Songbook. I like Soundgarden, love Audioslave, and can't stop listening to Songbook. Cornell has a very unique voice, and displays it wonderfully on this live acoustic set. I honestly never really cared for the song Black Hole Sun until hearing the version on this album. I like every song on this but I think the Zepplin cover of Thank You is my favorite, not that it is a better song than any of Cornell's originals, but I really enjoy when an artist makes a cover song sound better than the original. I am looking forward to the new Soundgarden album and I hope it encompasses the progression of Audioslave within the song structure.

B008PNBU30|5.0|Got this album today, listened to it while I was writing a unit plan for class and again while making dinner for my family. You can never judge an album on the first listen, nor should you. So a couple of songs stood out on first listen, then a couple more on second listen. I know it will grow on me just because of this band's great history. People pay $3 for an energy drink, or $6 for a fast food meal that lasts them for what, a few hours? So you pay $7 to $10 for an album that you can listen to for as long as you want. I haven't liked a lot of albums when they first came out, but now love those albums and that's why I would rather spend my $ on music than junk. Rock on Three Days Grace!
B000RIWAVW|5.0|Halloween (1978) is easily the best and most balanced horror movie of its kind; it's this movie that sparked a revolution of imitators that couldn't quite measure up. Halloween is everything a horror movie should be: suspenseful, chilling, cerebral, dark, and sometimes funny. One of the great things about this movie is the music. John Carpenter's soundtrack is one of a kind, and despite its simplicity, it's one of the best (if not the best) for the horror genre. The soundtrack is dark, depressing, and dreadful. Next, the lighting in this movie is well-done and sort of makes the whole setting seem like its under a full moon. Finally, the dialogue is chilling at times, especially the Donald Pleasance sequences. Thanks to his stellar acting, his chilling words about Michael Myers put the fear into the viewer, especially during the Myers house visit scene. And of course John Carpenter is a master of scaring the viewer without actually showing images. Halloween is the gold standard for all slasher films, and all horror films in general. A classic that's highly recommended.

1476715904|5.0|7 out of 5 stars<br /><br />I almost put this book down.<br />But I picked it up again<br />thinking maybe there was more<br />and there was so much more<br />than I ever, ever expected.<br /><br />Ok guys, I usually don't gush in my reviews.  I usually pick up one thing I loved about a book and write a review based on that thing I loved most and assume that other readers, as well as the author, can see what the book meant to me.  Turns out that isn't always the case and this book in particular- I want to write the review it deserves.<br /><br />Clarity has become extremely important to me this morning, after having finished Slammed.  Maybe none of this will mean anything to anyone else, but me and Colleen Hoover, but you are welcome to read, because this book blew me apart.<br /><br />It's true, I almost put it down.  I started reading and after 100 pages or so, I thought it was going to be just a story about a hot guy who lived across the street.  It was a nice story, but it didn't grab me by the throat.  The length of the story was daunting too: 1112 pages on my ereader, I think.  I put it down for a couple of months and then, recently, I realized I've gotten into a pattern of doing just that - not giving stories a chance if they don't drag me into them immediately.  I'm sure it's Sponge Bob Syndrome.<br /><br />But I made a decision to finish the books that hadn't quite pulled me in right away and this was the first.  And I'm sorry now that it took me so long to make the decision.  Hoover's written one of the best damn stories I've read in a long time, one of those books that moved me and inspired me and reduced me to tears.<br /><br />Once I picked it up again, I got to around page 200, or maybe it was even 250, and found out that the romance was not what I expected at all.  There was a fascinating twist that not only grabbed me by the throat, but dragged me through the book in less than a day.  I read while cooking dinner, eating dinner, standing, sitting, throwing the ball for the dogs, in between homework with the kids.  This book consumed me.<br /><br />Years ago I almost lost my father, then almost lost my mother within the span of the same year.  They both made it, but I was so close to losing them that it changed me  forever after.  Hoover's book relived some of that in me, healed some of it, and reiterated to me how books seem to be completely inspired.  I mean that they find you and speak directly to you and say things that would never be said between strangers otherwise.  This one spoke to me and resonated my soul like a tuning fork.  When I neared 1007 pages, the length of the novel suddenly seemed too short.<br /><br />The romance in this book was stunning, real, and beautifully written.  The enormous metaphor of finding a love that can also teach you about yourself and about life was mind-blowingly well done and the careful treatment of death and how we deal with it was heartbreaking and complete and amazing.  The poetry is incredible and artful on it's own and within its placement in the book.  The small details in the Halloween costumes and the carving pumpkins and the crazy categorizing...all of it made me cry and hurt and heal and call my parents to tell them again that I love them.  It made me reach out and touch my husband's feet when he came to bed and it insisted that I get up in the early, early morning and go kiss my children before they woke.<br /><br />This book made me cry.<br />And this book made me feel alive.<br />Colleen Hoover and I don't know each other.  But I feel like I've met her through her book and that she's told me a few things about life that will become part of the way I handle it, as do all the books and movies and people and situations that impact us in our lives.<br /><br />That is the magic of books.<br />And that is the powerful story you get with Slammed.<br />I highly recommend you grab yourself some of that magic.

0811875040|2.0|Until recently, the Miette web site wasn't selling its own book because they said the first 3 printings were flawed.  Apparently they believe the fourth printing has fixed all the earlier problems, and they're now selling the 4th printing.  The version that Amazon is currently selling doesn't appear to be the 4th printing.  The pictures are lovely, the ideas are charming, but buyer beware.
B0045HCJFS|5.0|this movie was very exciting and lots of action . I really enjoyed the movie. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes airplane adventures.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|I loved \\"Bared to You\\" and have re-read it twice.  I was so excited for the next saga between Eva and Gideon but the plot started rather slowly and then took off half way at a crazy pace.  However, once it picked up the plot lost all reality for me and just as suddenly it was over.  Perhaps my hopes were raised too high after book 1 but overall I really felt like there was so little of what I loved from book 1 in book 2 (beyond the hot sex that is).  I may very well buy book 3 just to have some resolution but overall I did not feel I got my money's worth in this one and certainly not my Gideon/Eva fix I was hoping for all these months.
B009CO0B2C|5.0|This album is amazing. It strikes a perfect balance between the atmospheres of \\"Daybreaker\\" and the cozy folk of \\"Comfort of Strangers\\". Beth's voice is as beautiful as ever, and the songwriting is as always a wonderful mix of intensity and playfulness. At just less than three listens I'm completely hooked. This will be in my car for three months easy.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Fun game, but a little slow . But totally addictive. I cant wait to get to the next level. It makes you want to keep on playing.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I could not put this book down.  The lens through which Goodwin chose to view Lincoln made the biography richer and more fun at the same time.  It is clearly well researched and while the author has her own point of view on the characters, I did not find it marred the essential historical accuracy of the book.  I will read Goodwin's other books after having read this one.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love everything about this app!! Very well organized and easy to use. I would definitely recommend this app to anyone.

B008G12ERC|4.0|I've been a pretty huge Muse fan for the better part of a decade now, and I'll admit, this album had me nervous. The Resistance was an obvious shift in sound, but it still felt like Muse. This album goes even further from the \\"norm\\" of the rest of their work, but I'm happy to say that not all change is bad. Except for \\"Survival\\". That song is the creepy uncle that I will forever refuse to acknowledge at family gatherings. But, being a pretty big fan of electronica, some of the music they've made this time around came as a pleasant surprise (ex: \\"Follow Me\\"), and the two part 2nd Law tracks are pretty cool as well, in spite of being instrumental. Best of all, Chris does an excellent job with the writing and vocals on \\"Save Me\\" and \\"Liquid State\\".<br /><br />However, not all of the change works as well as the rest. While the album is pretty stellar musically, I feel like Bellamy is almost trying too hard with some of the lyrics, in a way that makes them laughable. Sometimes literally. Look no further than \\"Survival\\", once again, for a prime example of the 100% cheeseball lyrics that the album is sometimes capable of. However, if you're able to look past some often silly lyrics and just appreciate the music and the band as a whole, you will be satisfied with your purchase!<br /><br />Also, they put the \\"lyrics\\" to the dubstep-esque 2nd Law tracks in the booklet. Not relevant to anything, but I find that amusing.
B0091REZMW|4.0|its a fun game.  i agree it could be faster.  it is a nice change from what i have been playing
B0030V0PEW|4.0|The more complex our society becomes, the more that is expected of us, the more important it is for us to simplify.  In The Checklist Manifesto, Atul Gawande shows how complex industries like construction, aviation and even the medical industry are increasing relying on the simple too of checklists. The Checklist Manifesto is a good book on the theory and practicality of using checklists.  The examples of how checklists are used and developed are useful, but I would have like to see some action steps and best practices on creating checklists.  Well worth the read, but don't expect explicit direction on how to create your own checklists.  [[ASIN:0312430000 The Checklist Manifesto: How to Get Things Right]]
B007GCY8FS|3.0|A Wanted Man by Lee Child.......Not up to the usual standard of Lee Child's previous Jack Reacher novels.  As I read this book, I kept waiting for something to happen.  It was interesting, but, not a \\"I don't want this book to end kind of interesting.\\"<br />I hope that Lee Child will continue writing novel Reacher novels.  I love the character and look forward to more great novels by this author.
030771652X|5.0|This book is awesome!!  I recommend this to anyone who loves the family relationships.  This is a book about sisters - yes the name of the book.  The author writes eloquently like this quote \\"I threw everything we had together - the strong roots and stems and leaves and beautiful soft blossoms of sisterhood - into the earth with you. And I was left standing on the edge, so diminished by the loss that I thought I could no longer be there.\\" There are several other parts that I LOVED.  This book kept my attention until the end, but I had to read it slowly to enjoy the author's writing style.  I had to read several parts 3-4 times just because I loved her style.  For another example \\"Was the feeling that all is right with the world, my world, because you were its foundations, formed in childhood and with me grown into adulthod -- was that to replaced by nothing?  The ghastliness of nothing.  Because I was nobody's sister now.\\"
B004LWZWDS|5.0|This is one of 3 movies during the 80s that I saw the play they were based upon. The others being [[ASIN:B002GTZSZU Amadeus: Director's Cut [Blu-ray]]] and [[ASIN:B008AT71WI Little Shop of Horrors: Director's Cut [Blu-ray]]]. They were all great movies and great plays. Dangerous Liaisons stands out for several reasons. The subject matter was ingenious and its much like the movie [[ASIN:B000OT6UZQ Cruel Intentions [Blu-ray]]], set in the age of French 18th century aristocracy. Its a movie that is perfectly cast and I think the first that I saw Thurman and Malkovich along with a very young Keanu Reeves. The movie going public still had Amadeus on their minds, one of the greatest period pieces ever made, and Dangerous Liaisons with its more scandalous storyline, beautiful costumes, sets and music was an instant hit. I don't think Malkovich has ever been better. Glenn Close is perfect. Young Uma Thurman and Keanu Reeves fit their roles of naive pawns  perfectly. Come to think of it, this must be like those romance novels women are addicted to, lol. Truly decadent, yet a true delight.<br /><br />This Blu-ray transfer is beautiful. Lots of detail, wonderful lighting and no glaring issues. This was shot in the late 80s, on film, with natural lighting yet its not a dark film like [[ASIN:B000Y5CHIE The Last of the Mohicans: Director's Definitive Cut [Blu-ray]]] and Warner Brothers thankfully didn't use noise reduction to get rid of the film grain. The audio is very good too. Dialog is clear and the music comes through wonderfully. Extras include a never heard before commentary and a trailer.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|After I read the first book, I couldn't decide qabout reading the 2nd, since<br />I don't care to read about pain.  My friend said the 2nd was better.  The 2nd was better, but I got tired of anticipated erotica and the stupidity of a woman who would allow anyone to hurt her.  If you only want erotica, it is a good read.

B007IXWKUK|3.0|It seemed to me that both the first and second book (over 500 pages each) were just about sex between Christian and Ana. I loved the funny banter that they exchanged via email. There should have been more of that, rather than all the sex. Come on! We get it! They like to have sex! The parts that are not explaining their sex life are pretty good though. I do agree with some of the other reviews that Christian is too needy and controling. Ana needs to just hush up! She is so afraid that she is not enough for him, and that he is going to leave her. Well he should just leave her for starting arguements all the time on this subject!! It seems they are either fighting or having sex! After about 200 pages in the FIRST book, I was pretty much done with all the sex parts. I heard tons of positive reviews for this book. It was even talked about on the radio, and how \\"sexy\\" it is. I had to read it, just because everyone was talking about it. I have the 3rd book loaded on my Kindle (which I purchased at the same time I bought the 2nd), but I am not sure if I will finish the series. Like I said the stuff in between the bedroom scenes can be very entertaining. I especially like the emails as they are cute. I think the series would be better if the books were shorter too. Sometimes it seems to drag on. At times I want to smack Ana because she is being super difficult. She either needs to walk away or accept that Christian wants to be with her! And Christian needs to just relax! Sheesh! How in the world would either one of them even think about marriage when they haven't known each other that long, constantly fight, and have big commitment issues! Well good luck to them!
B009D0LBRO|3.0|I was excited to see Rayman finally on the Android Os. For $2.99 it's an awesome price. There's one glaring issue with this game compared to the typical Rayman games. There isn't a storyline to follow. Jungle Run is just that a series of running puzzle maps where all you do is tap the screen somewhere to control a single aspect such as jumping or punching. You cannot really control Rayman in any other way. Sadly because of this the game loses almost all of its appeal rather quickly and becomes tedious after only a few amazingly short levels.  The game looks amazing and I did not experience any glitchiness in the control system or ability for the Fire to keep up.  For the price its ok but if you are like me and like the quirky stories the Rayman games have,  you would be better to save the $3.00 for something else.
1569242739|5.0|the book is amazing, my husband bought this book for me so I can try baking the vegan way. I'm new to the vegan world and will go shopping to find ingredients I don't have in the pantry. Recipes sound delicious and can't wait to try them.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|I was SO looking forward to this book - I wasn't totally disappointed, however, I wasn't sad when it ended. I feel like the story wasn't believable enough. Eva would never put up with non-communication...and is murder really sexy? And whats with all the kicking butt training if you aren't going to intorduce Nathan and let Eva unleash and get her revenge herself? Especially when Cary gets hurt by him.<br /><br />Still, I liked the book, although I wanted MORE. I am not as excited for book 3 like I was for #2. But I will buy it because she writes beautifully and I was still entertained in the end.<br /><br />I found myself smiling at her relationship with her parents in the end and heated at some of the \\"naughty\\" parts.<br /><br />I give it a SOLID 3 maybe 4 stars and hope for more in the 3rd book, even though with Nathan dead where is the story going to lead us? Except pregnancy???? I thought several times withthe periods and food talk we would hear that she was knocked up.

B004HW7JHE|5.0|Compelling.<br /><br />Most TV shows start to feel tired after about 4 seasons. The characters become predictable and the plot lines repetitive. Mad Men only gets better with age. Season 5 holds some of the strongest episodes yet. One the one hand I don't see how they can possibly keep producing at this level, on the other hand they continue to come through season after season. This is TV that will make you buy the DVD just so you can loan it to your friends and say, \\"No really, you Have to watch this\\".
B0011Z5IVE|5.0|I'm 26 and I've been listening to Zepp since I found out about them on 2001, back in high school. I've always listened to classic rock but when I first listened to Misty Mountain hop I felt like I had awakened ,like I never fully experienced rock until that moment ...they have the unique music style that my soul craved ,at that moment I listened to it I felt like I was complete. I just love how the guitar and bass intertwines beautifully with the drums. And how Plant provides the jolt of power that makes it a masterpiece ,It's out of this world ,it's like music from the gods ...whenever I feel down I know that Led Zeppelin is there to make everything alright again. I really cannot describe in words how awesome and how unique this band is ,one just has to listen to them to understand. I would definitely recommend anyone to buy this Album ..or any of them ,all of their music is unique and one of the most precious treasures that will never be matched by anyone or anything... they just have no match ,it's a real shame that most of today's generation don't know of this music ,most of them listen to garbage now in days. I'm trying to teach my kid about this music so that he may one day come to appreciate them as much as I do ,and hopefully in a future he'll do the same with his kids :)
B00863DOS8|4.0|Heck I am Impressed that they have a Blu-Ray version! Some bigger bands like Kiss, Pink Floyd, Aerosmith, dont even have them yet.<br />I just wish the show was longer and had more of the older songs.<br />But its a good concert and a keeper.<br /><br />I hope the next version is a Blu-Ray and a more complete show.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|Was a really great book, devoured it in a day, and loved how it told more about Gideon's past but have to honestly say, as good as it was, wasn't as good as the first one, even though I read it in one day, I did hit parts that I struggled to keep reading, got very frustrated with the story line at times in this book, seemed more a suspenseful book rather than a romance, but did like how it came together in the end, just wondering where they will go from here.  Although true life is not always rosy, romantic and perfect, hoping book three has a bit more good times and romance in it than this did, as I tend to read these books to escape a world of stress and imperfections, and not be tied up in knots the whole time I am reading
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app is great! Before the app came out I would get on pinterest through the web but it was difficult to pin anything. It's so much easier now!
B003Y5H5HO|4.0|It was really good and very close to the book. I just missed a few details from the book. I wouldn't recommend it to someone who is sensitive its a very graphic movie
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|I loved, loved, loved both The Lost Hero and The Son of Neptune but just don't have the same enthusiasm for The Mark of Athena.  Don't get me wrong, I still really like this book, it just isn't quite as good as the first two.  I think that 7 main characters and 4 narrators is just too much.  There were just too many things going on and it didn't feel like one cohesive story.  Also, I missed getting to know new characters.  I'm not a huge fan of the romances (that's not at all why I like these books) and so the focus on the three couplings wasn't as interesting to me.<br /><br />Having said that, it is still a must read for all Percy Jackson fans and it is going to be a long year waiting to see how the cliffhanger at the end is resolved.
B0027MJU00|4.0|Really good depiction of the human nature when exposed to a minimal amount of caring..The reading becomes dark because you obviously think things will get better at some point. But they don't..AT times a bit predictable but you would not want to stop reading once it gets to you. I read the book while I walk for miles..it only took me three days and I was satisfied of the general idea of the author. I got this book because I just have finished reading \\"Gone Girl\\" as to I was excited about that one. THis is good but not as good...Still recommended

B008Y1YFNU|5.0|I have always held Getting Away with Murder as their best album with Paramour Sessions a close second.  I was disappointed in Metamorphosis.  Infest is a fun album but overally not one of my favorites.  The Connection is basically taking the best elements of all the Papa Roach albums and perfectly putting them together.  This is a kickass album from start to finish.  They dont let up and put together maybe their most complete album to date.<br /><br />My early favs are Give Me Back My Life, Where Did The Angels Go, Before I Die, and Leader of the Broken Hearts.<br /><br />Very good rock album from one of todays best hard rock bands.  Dont let their past as a rock/rap band hold you back from giving this album a chance.  They have some elements of that on The Connection but for the most part its a hard rock album.<br /><br />BTW, I know Jacoby is dealing with some throat issues but when this band does tour for this album go see the show.  One of the best live shows you will see.  Non stop energy and they bring it every time.
B006MVJ2L4|4.0|Adam Lambert is the real thing. He is charismatic, flamboyant and sings his @ss off. He isn't here to make you like him, he's here to make you pay attention. He's not just there to shock you, he's here to make 100% certain that he was all everyone talks about afterwards. And they do. For days. Lambert laid it all on the table; from his sexuality to his theater background, all so you'd take notice. There hasn't been someone so blatantly lunging fists first at rock stardom since Billy Corgan smashed his pumpkins. And his new album is even better than the debut.<br /><br />\\"Trespassing\\" quits the all-over-the-place song-styling of \\"For Your Entertainment and concentrates on dance-rock. He cuts right to the chase on the title track and opening song, where he pounds out a drum/bass line worthy of Queen and states up front \\"No Trespassing, yeah well my *ss, wait till you get a hold of me.\\" Make no mistake, Adam is out to make you dance (Nile Rodgers and Sam Sparrow guest on the slinky \\"Shady\\") while \\"Pop That Lock\\" trades on both dance and EDM style without giving up an inch of style. That may be because this time, Lambert has songwriter's credit on almost all the disc's tracks, as opposed the \\"FYE,\\" where almost every song was outsider composed and usually by a star/stunt guest (Pink, Weezer, Justin Hawkins of the Darkness, etc).<br /><br />Even the outsider songs have punch. \\"Better Than I Know Myself\\" continues the formula of the ballads like \\"Whataya Want From Me\\" from the debut. There's a cathedral of multi-tracked Lamberts and a climaxing production. Same with \\"Never Close Our Eyes,\\" a Bruno Mars song that has a plenty of soul. Lambert explores both his vocal range and his emotional one on \\"Trespassing,\\" with these two ballads, the interesting \\"Underneath\\" and the stunning closer \\"Outlaws of Love.\\" Without saying it explicitly, it's the main exploration of Adam's out-ness, (or the night after the party ends, you choose), but is sure sounds like a defensive pose in favor of relationships.<br /><br />The funny thing is, \\"Outlaws\\" may be the album's most restrained performance. Adam maybe be the kind of man for whom over-the-top is merely a barrier to be conquered as often as possible, but when he \\"they say we'll rot in hell, well, I don't think we will. They've branded us enough, Outlaws of Love.\\" As stunning as he is when he's glamming it up on the dance floor, Adam can be more effective when he's pulling back on the reins. He'll be doing some dates as Freddie Mercury with Queen this year, but the Adam Lambert of \\"Trespassing\\" is his own man now.avor of relationships.<br /><br />The funny thing is, \\"Outlaws\\" may be the album's most restrained performance.

B007THA4FI|5.0|Welcome to Pagford.<br /><br />It is a picture perfect little town: rolling hills, ancient abbey, cobbled streets, charming houses and colourful inhabitants. However, like everything that looks perfect, secrets run rampant through Pagford's streets, waiting for the moment to be set free.<br /><br />That moment arrives in the death of Barry Fairbrother. After suffering an aneurism on the night of his wedding anniversary, the town of Pagford becomes torn. With Barry's death, a Casual Vacancy arises, a seat left vacant on the Parish Council due to death.<br /><br />There are a few hopefuls vying for the coveted seat: Howard Mollison wants his son Miles to take the seat so that Miles can help Howard rid Pagford of The Fields, a rundown part of town home to a methadone clinic. Howard is thrilled at Barry's death as Howard may finally rid Pagford of an eyesore. Miles' wife Samantha, however, is less than thrilled and begins to fantasize about much younger boys.<br /><br />Collin Wall, Deputy Head minister of the local high school, also wants to run for the vacant seat. As Barry's former best friend, Collin thinks Barry would have wanted him to carry on his work, bringing The Fields and Pagford together, instead of tearing them apart.<br /><br />Tessa Wall, who is the school guidance counselor, is more concerned over the antics of their son Stuart \\"Fats\\" and his association with Krystal Weedon and the mental state of her husband if he actually wins the seat; Collin hides a secret that could ruin him if exposed.<br /><br />Simon Price also wants to run, despite having isolated himself from the community. His wife, Ruth, approves of him running because she is used to agreeing. It is the only way to keep him from getting angry. Often abusive to his two sons, Andrew \\"Arf\\" and Paul, taking in stolen goods and stealing from his place of work, Andrew wonders what would happen to his father if his secrets got out.<br /><br />Even those not hoping to fill the casual vacancy are affected by Barry Fairbrother's death: Parminder, who harbors secret feelings of her own, lavishes attention on one daughter while degrading her other daughter Sukhvinder who cuts herself to release the pain. Kay, a social worker who has just been assigned to help Terri Weedon and her children Krystal and Robbie as their mother struggles with heroin addiction.<br /><br />There's also Gaia, Kay's daughter, who is bereft at leaving London because her mother followed her noncommittal boyfriend Gavin Wall to Pagford. Gavin, who knows he never should have let his relationship with Kay go so far is only concerned with ending the relationship and the love he holds close for another woman. Let's not forget Shirley Mollison, Howard's wife, who has her own secret agenda or Maureen, Howard's business partner, who does whatever Howard says; Or what about Mary Fairbrother who had grown to dislike her husband and his growing attachment to Krystal Weedon?<br /><br />Pagford is a picture perfect little town. Like anything that looks perfect, there is shadow underneath. What would happen if that shadow were exposed? What if the secrets of those in town were exposed, out in public? Would Pagford hold itself together, or would cracks begin to appear in its postcard image?<br /><br />Before the Casual Vacancy is filled, the town of Pagford will find out and no one will be the same...<br />I wasn't expecting to like The Casual Vacancy, much less love it. This has nothing to do with the fact that it's not the next Harry Potter book. I knew going into The Casual Vacancy to have no expectations because it was decidedly not Harry Potter. Rowling's first book for adults couldn't be more different than that other fictional world she created, but a small town political novel just didn't sound thrilling to me.<br /><br />There was also the fact that, from the first page, I knew that The Casual Vacancy wasn't going to be a quick read. The tone of the writing is completely different and I knew it would not feature the wicked fast plot of the Harry Potter novels. However, I read on anyways, knowing that Rowling is a good writer and hoping for a good story.<br /><br />Well, I was wrong. J K Rowling is an incredible writer and in The Casual Vacancy she had penned an amazing novel with an amazing story. The Casual Vacancy actually has very little to do with the politics surrounding the title. Instead, it is really a study of the people who live in Pagford and the whims of human nature.<br /><br />I suspect that the title of J K Rowling's new novel is really a play on words. A Casual Vacancy is a situation in which a political assembly's seat is declared vacant through resignation, disqualification or death. However, due to the nature of all of Pagford being involved and the possibility of an election that has split the town and those that want the vacant seat for their own ends, there is nothing casual about this vacancy.<br /><br />As I read, I was reminded of many different authors. If I had to compare it to anything (although Rowling has written it so well that The Casual Vacancy is really incomparable), I would say it's a mix of Charles Dickens, Maeve Binchy, Minette Walters and Meg Rosoff. The Casual Vacancy is bleak, gut wrenching, horrifying, frightening but also joyful and surprisingly funny. It's a book that defies genres and boundaries.<br /><br />Rowling's strength as a writer has never been more noticeable than with The Casual Vacancy. Her characters are so well drawn that you identify with each and every one of them and the further you read, the more you become involved in their lives. Multiple storylines criss cross and meet up with each other and it takes a writer of the highest caliber to keep all of the intersecting characters and storylines straight and still tell an amazing story. Surprisingly, the young adult characters in this novel (Andrew, Stuart, Gaia, Shukvinder, Krystal) play a larger role than I thought possible in a \\"political novel\\". Rowling's adult characters are just as well drawn and as you watch all of their lives intersect, you wonder how Rowling can possibly tie everything together in the end. Thankfully, she does it with grace and style and an ending I never, ever saw coming.<br /><br />Make no mistake, though, this is an adult novel. In the pages of The Casual Vacancy, you'll find drugs and drug use, sex, racism, prejudice, rape, theft, poverty, cutting and self-abuse. However, you will also find laughter, humour, joy, determination and hope. It is a novel less about politics than it is about the people who make up a community.<br /><br />The Casual Vacancy is beautifully written and incredibly told. It is not a novel for the faint of heart, but is also a novel so full of heart that the characters within it will stay with me for the rest of my life. It made me laugh out loud, made me cry in public, had me rooting for some characters and loving to hate others.<br /><br />It is a book you do not merely read; instead, you live inside of it until the last turn of the page and beyond.uld not feature the wicked fast plot of the Harry Potter novels. However, I read on anyways, knowing that Rowling is a good writer and hoping for a good story.<br /><br />Well, I was wrong. J K Rowling is an incredible writer and in The Casual Vacancy she had penned an amazing novel with an amazing story. The Casual Vacancy actually has very little to do with the politics surrounding the title. Instead, it is really a study of the people who live in Pagford and the whims of human nature.<br /><br />I suspect that the title of J K Rowling's new novel is really a play on words. A Casual Vacancy is a situation in which a political assembly's seat is declared vacant through resignation, disqualification or death. However, due to the nature of all of Pagford being involved and the possibility of an election that has split the town and those that want the vacant seat for their own ends, there is nothing casual about this vacancy.<br /><br />As I read, I was reminded of many different authors. If I had to compare it to anything (although Rowling has written it so well that The Casual Vacancy is really incomparable), I would say it's a mix of Charles Dickens, Maeve Binchy, Minette Walters and Meg Rosoff. The Casual Vacancy is bleak, gut wrenching, horrifying, frightening but also joyful and surprisingly funny. It's a book that defies genres and boundaries.<br /><br />Rowling's strength as a writer has never been more noticeable than with The Casual Vacancy. Her characters are so well drawn that you identify with each and every one of them and the further you read, the more you become involved in their lives. Multiple storylines criss cross and meet up with each other and it takes a writer of the highest caliber to keep all of the intersecting characters and storylines straight and still tell an amazing story. Surprisingly, the young adult characters in this novel (Andrew, Stuart, Gaia, Shukvinder, Krystal) play a larger role than I thought possible in a \\"political novel\\". Rowling's adult characters are just as well drawn and as you watch all of their lives intersect, you wonder how Rowling can possibly tie everything together in the end. Thankfully, she does it with grace and style and an ending I never, ever saw coming.<br /><br />Make no mistake, though, this is an adult novel. In the pages of The Casual Vacancy, you'll find drugs and drug use, sex, racism, prejudice, rape, theft, poverty, cutting and self-abuse. However, you will also find laughter, humour, joy, determination and hope. It is a novel less about politics than it is about the people who make up a community.<br /><br />The Casual Vacancy is beautifully written and incredibly told. It is not a novel for the faint of heart, but is also a novel so full of heart that the characters within it will stay with me for the rest of my life. It made me laugh out loud, made me cry in public, had me rooting for some characters and loving to hate others.<br /><br />It is a book you do not merely read; instead, you live inside of it until the last turn of the page and beyond.
B008GVD6D8|5.0|oh wow the sequel was even better than the first book.....in every aspect. you wont be disappointed. i couldnt put it down .
B007P6VM04|5.0|I really love the music from SMASH, so I was very excited to have the cd to belt along with in the car. The only disappointment I had was that the Bollywood-esque song \\"1001 Nights\\" was not included. Other than that, it's a great collection of great music.
B001OQCV6A|5.0|great movie.  We enjoyed it very much, and could watch it again for sure!  it is one of our favorites for the time being.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|The second book in the trilogy was everything that I expected.  I waited a long time for this book and it was  a great read that I completed too fast.  I wanted the experience to last longer, but leaving  the book was difficult.  He characters were compelling and interesting.  I look forward to the concluding edition.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|My husband and I LOVE the movie.  Check it out, we would recommended it to everyone, except for young children of course.
B008V0OLOW|1.0|Never understood the hype about Krall. If you really want to listen to real Jazz singers then start with Sarah Vaughan, Ella, Della Reese or Nancy Wilson for that matter. All Krall is is a manufactured wannabe. The fact she has to pose in a revealing outfit on her cd is bad enough. Pure shit.
B0030IIYWA|5.0|love the movie.  It has made a wonderful addition to our pixar collection.  We have all three and think they are great!
1423140605|5.0|I can't believe how great this book was. I simply COULD NOT put it down and now I have to wait another whole year for the next. What an ending!!!
B0083Z614S|4.0|This is the 38th of the Top 100 books as chosen by librarians I have read.  All of them have been good, some of them have been great.  This one is very good.  Alot of the classics can be a bit dark or depressing.  This one like David Copperfield by Dickens, brightens your day.  I find myself smiling while I am reading it.  It is a good reminder, that the earth can bring joy, anticipation, and a sense of accomplishment.
B006OOHYIC|1.0|just noticed my profile got wiped as well. sigh... q w e r t y. a w s d. azx
B008XG1X18|5.0|I truly enjoy the array of topics and how easy it is to use. I love sharing as well as creating pins! Works great on my Aneroid phone and my Kindle Fire.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|My life stopped when I started this book, and now that Ive finished it I hate that #3 isnt all ready out....Eva and Gideons story is beyond words beautiful..... Will wait a few days and read both 1 and 2 again!!!!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This reads like a fiction thriller.  One of the best books I've read this year.  You'll love this read and recommend to all your friends
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME ! my grand kids &amp; I have made every night family game night around our house
B008PNBU30|4.0|I have been eager to pick up this album for a long time now and was extremely excited when I saw that the release was set for October 2nd.  I heard the lead single on Sirius XM's Octane and was very impressed and eager for the album to drop.  Now that is has, here is the review:  \\"Sign of the Times\\" is the introduction to the album, and it's just that.  More than an actual song it seems like an introduction, which in my opinion is a skip track.  Not that it's not musical, but it lacks any type of depth or \\"catchiness.\\"  \\"Chalk Outline - the lead single - is a great single and overall a great song.  This is the Three Days Grace that we love. \\"The High Road\\" and \\"Operate\\" - At this point (during the writing of this review) - may be my favorite tracks on the album.  It definitely reminds me of the vibe set on their last album, \\"Life Starts Now.\\"  Any Three Days Grace fan will enjoy these tracks!  \\"Transit of Venus\\" has received some harsh reviews and some extreme reviews and I'm basically going to have to lay it in the middle.  If it were up to me I would give it a 3.5 but unfortunately I can't do that, so I'm going to just up it to a 4 star since overall these guys are great.  It's not their best work but definitely an enjoyable album for any Three Days Grace fan or rock fan in general.<br /><br />Rockin' on the Transit of Venus!<br /><br />DZA tha Dangerous is in effect!
0857520652|5.0|I picked this for my book club selection. We are a group of people in a retirement community.  It was the perfect choice I thought as I read it.  We all often feel stuck , I think.  And the feeling of... is this it... Is this my Beautiful Life?  and the joy of adventure and freedom and the fear and the pain.  And then there is the blame that covers our love for one another....And I liked the writing.
B005LAIHYU|3.0|I did not get to see this in the theater or read the book, but the title itself sounded intriguing, so when I was given the opportunity to review this I took it. While the idea of Abraham Lincoln being a vampire hunter was very far out there, the movie itself was well made and action packed. Please be aware that you are not going to get a historically accurate depiction of Lincoln in this movie, but instead a movie that is full of great visual effects that will kee you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end! As someone who did not read this book, I will definitely say that the movie was one that was fun. The acting was not emmy award winning, but you will definitely stay engaged and will get sucked into the action and special effects!
B0091REZMW|5.0|I enjoy all games by Game Insight. It's nice to be able to play with or without wi-fi. It is possible to play without spending real money although it does make getting through the levels slower. Still plenty of things to find.
B008G12ERC|5.0|Took me a few listens to fall in love with this, but now I absolutely love it! I am so happy this band never repeats themselves. They always push new ground, and this is by far their most diverse record yet.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this for my kindle fire. so much easier than trying to browse via the web. great design and its free!
0525953728|5.0|The book made me proud to be an American.  It was well writen on very much on point.  I am not an emotional person, but this book made me well up a little at the end.  The author had a great deal of pride in America and his unit.  To bad some folks in DC did not like it.  Perhaps the authors point of view was to close to the truth.
B0086449YA|2.0|I was really looking forward to receiving and listening to Mark's latest. What a disappointment! As a long time Dire Straits/MK fan, who I have seen in concert, this double cd is music that will put you to sleep. No creativity. This is elevator music. Sorry Mark, I hate to put the kabosh on your latest release, but please, next time, liven things up a bit.
B0079IEPHA|5.0|This absolutely is one of my 3 top favorite shows on television. I wish it had more episodes. Love each of the characters on this show. They are all amazing and the writing of each episde is fantastic. Love Harvey and Mike! Great chemistry of all the characters...<br />Donna is hysterical as well!
B003L77G06|5.0|After watching the first season I could hardly wait till the second one came out and yes it is just as funny as the first season.  When I need a good laugh I plug in one of the season's of Modern Family.  They are all so good at getting you to laugh.
B0072GPPNC|5.0|There was a few differences between the Broadway show and the Movie.  Broadway show was fantastic, and if you have a chance to see it, you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />Very good movie
B0018QOIXU|5.0|This is her first album and it is one great CD.  I love to listen to her sang as it is a pop/jazz type of music can't wait to listen to her second album. Everyone buy this one and then buy the second one also.
1451662432|1.0|Literary folks, I didn't need to read this book to see that it should be called \\"Total Actor\\". If I wanted to reward a self-important, ego maniac by buying his book, I would.  Arnold has manipulated the public and his family for so long that it's become a joke. It should be listed under fiction, or comedy-if it wasn't so sad. Now, he wants \\"reconciliation\\"? What a sociopath! When you write \\"a true life story\\", character is always relevant. If you believe an actor/liars autobiography, then you deserve to have wasted $20. But, if you truly believe that Arnold is our savior, you will love this book. I hear his next book will be called \\"Pumping The Help\\".
B004YM6JLO|5.0|This is one show I can watch everyday.  What this show has grown into is a very exciting an suspenceful show I watch everyweek. Now that I have the 3rd season dvd I can go back and watch each show again and again.
B008N1V11U|5.0|this is the best app ever !!!!! works really well on my kindle fire I love it well worth the money
B0053O89RY|5.0|This is one show I can watch over and over again. It has so many stories that are so funny. It is almost like a very live family and all their stories they tell.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is wonderful. My brother and I have it on Xbox 360 and PC, but those aren't how do you say.... portable. I have been waiting FOREVER for it to come out in the Amazon market for my Kindle Fire, and have been having to use my brother's phone to play it when we were waiting at IHOP. I had it off 4Shared, but it didn't download well off of that and now I'm soooooooo excited I can get it on the market! Thank you Mojang! Also you should definately play it!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|She has done it again with her second album and all the new songs.  She will sure go along time and as she gets more reviews and more people hear her songs they will feel like I do a great sanger.
0452289963|4.0|As a huge fan of Eckhart Tolle, I would recommend ANY/ALL of his books. This one in particular did not have the same impact on me as did [[ASIN:1577314808 The Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment]] however.  I'm not sure if that has more to do with the book itself or if it's because I read one before the other. It may be like a movie sequal: Even if the 2nd movie is as good or better than the 1st, it's difficult to recapture the \\"newness\\" of the 1st attempt. I hope that makes sense. I felt this book was a GREAT read, but that it didn't have the impact on me like The Power of Now.
B005IQZB14|5.0|This is such an eye opener to all we take for granted in day to day life.  Truly inspiring! thank you
B007FEFLTO|4.0|As with all of his books the attention to historical detail is tremendous. The account of the horrors and hardships and suffering inflicted on the populations is reiterated in painstaking detail.  The family \\"story lines\\" I felt were somewhat less compelling than those in the previous book.  All in all a very good read, with good focus on political and economic factors that underlie the conflict.  I am looking forward to the final book in the series.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Ms. Day has done it yet again! This book is beyond words. I did not think it was possible to fall even more in love with Gideon. WRONG! (even when you are reading the parts that make you say WHAT THE HECK IS HE THINKING??!!??). This book is everything the first one was and so much more. If you have not already you MUST read this book!!!!
B0054N73EY|3.0|I have to say this album is ok but is not as good as Californication or Stadium Arcadium. There are just a few good songs, not all the content is great.
0525953728|5.0|I wasn't to big on the whole reading thing but when I heard of this book I knew I would have to read it and it was the best decision I made this book is really interesting I recommend it to all..
B007DIQC90|5.0|I think this is a great album, I like all the songs in it. The fussion of different syles and istruments is great. I would say is totally worth it.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I really like this app, though I must admit it brings out my geeky self. It is nice to know how long your battery may last in various applications. Plus, the charging status of the battery is helpful.
B004LGPBZI|4.0|I have to say I am a big OASIS fan, is my favourite band.The succes of Oasis had to coponents, the lyrics by Noel and the voice by Liam. Now what is left of one of the greatest bands ever in this cd is just the voice of Liam. The songs in it are good, but it is not OASIS. Lyrics used to be better. But I think it is a good album after all.
0449227421|2.0|I am a huge fan of Ken Follett's work, but in this novel, his superb narrative skills seem to have eluded him.  The characters--primary and secondary- are basically one-dimensional (and that one dimension is repeated and replayed often). We have a host of supposedly intelligent, if not brilliant people, who seem to learn nothing from their experiences.  The story is a good one, but I have come to expect much more from the author of \\"A Dangerous Fortune,\\"  \\"Pillars of the Earth,\\" and so many great novels.
B008XG1X18|5.0|It works great, good app for pinteresting! I have not had any issue with this app on my kindle fire. Has a great layout and very easy to use. I would highly reccomend this app to anyone who likes pinterest.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I've never read military books, and I would likely have never read this book at all except that the government had threatened to ban sales, so I figured it was my last chance.  I found it immensely entertaining and and an easy, gripping read that catches you from the first page.  I don't think I've ever read a book so quickly.  This book was greatly enhanced by expressing a personal story in first person narrative, while giving a glimpse of seal training and missions.  I can't tell how good this book is relative to other seal books, but for someone who's never read about seals before, this was awesome!
B0031RAOVY|4.0|Loved the film.  Cried like a baby.  Just curious... was Baby Hachi actually played by a Shiba Inu pup?  I had a Shiba for 15 years, and the puppy's proportions seemed more Shiba-like than that of an Akita...
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I just finished Reflected in You and was blown away.  Gut wrenching emotion switching back and forth from Eva to Gideon and including Cary.  I was exhausted and elated at the end.  Ms. Day uses every character to enhance this story making Eva and Gideon's story \\"more\\".  Can't wait for the last book.  Hope it releases before Dec. 31.  Thank you Ms. Day, please write more contemporary novels and keep the alphas coming.
B007TBZ63Y|1.0|I downloaded the book on the first day, and found that the letters for most of the book were in a light grey that was difficult to read on my 18 month old black & white screen Kindle. Every two or three pages there would be a short section that was in black text, but it would be indented, unlike the rest of the page.<br />I have just downloaded it onto my iPhone 4s but the grey text is totally unreadable. I would be interested if other Kindle readers are having this problem.
B004LROUNG|5.0|Interesting book about the lives of two lawyers, whose work is reduced to ambulance chasing and wills.  A fellow lawyer comes into their lives by accident and changes everything.<br />The characters are well developed, and the outcome is not predictable. The story is easy to follow and sense of doing the right thing makes The Litigators an uplifting read.
B008D19WBQ|1.0|I cancelled my pre-order because I just found out that this set won't contain the extended episodes already released on DVD, just the original broadcast episodes. And they're asking close to $200? I don't think so! I think a blu-ray release should contain more, not less, content than previous releases. Blu-ray is a premium product, and they ask a premium price, so buyers should get premium content.
0618001905|5.0|I received the book quickly and began to read it immediately. It reads like a novel and is riveting. It is an important book to read.
B008BIZ06M|4.0|I'm a fan of the Offspring, it's more mellow to me than the Americana albn, but its fun for exercise!
B004KBSQOW|5.0|Very nice greatest hits package from one of Hawaii's best vocalist!  Israel Kamakawiwo'ole warms my heart when listening to these songs with sounds of the Islands.  There is much ALOHA love in every song.  You will enjoy this CD of beautiful music!
1451662432|5.0|There are plenty of others that have mentioned that most of the \\"readers\\" who rated this book one star DIDN'T EVEN READ THE BOOK and are bashing this book because they do not like Arnold as a person and of course the recent extra marital affair that he had. I just want to balance the books and add a five star rating. I AM GOING TO BUY THIS BOOK!
B008XG1X18|3.0|I live the formatting. Its really simple and easy to follow, like the website. it does, however, have some hiccups. for example, it never opens on the first try. It also force closes when I try to repin sometimes. Overall, I like it, but I would like it better without the hiccups.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|So addicting! I play this game at college whenever I'm eating lunch or doing anything pretty much. It can be really challenging but when you complete a puzzle your brain tickles with happiness! Me and my girlfriend absolutely love it.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I absolutely LOVED this book!!! I have read fifty shades three times and I love this story more. I read this book in under 24 hours and I'm dying to find out what happens next!! The story of Gideon and Eva is so dramatic and insane, but they're so insanely in love. Even through their fights and everything, they're always there for eachother and madly in love. I recommend this series to everyone!!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is fun for the whole family. this is the 1st free game that you dont have to feel obligated to dump money into. It would be cool if you could move at least your animals though.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Absolutely addictive!  I read this 3 times, as well as the second book in the trilogy also 3 times - all 6 readings done in less than a month.  Deborah Harkness has an incredible way with words, with describing characters and scenes.  I am in love with all the characters, as well as with the story, and cannot wait for book #3 in the All Souls Trilogy to come out.  I have recommended these books to everyone I know, whether they read or not.
B005LAII80|5.0|It is an utter crime how this movie flopped at the box office. To be honest I had no idea what to expect when I entered the theater to see this movie. Initially i wanted to go see \\"Looper\\" but for some reason at the time I was in the mood for something less cerebral, so me and my buddy chose to see Dredd 3D after a class mate told me to check it out and that it was phenomenal.  My God, I was completely blown away! I was so blown away that I went to see it again immediately the next day!<br /><br />You can tell the director of this film really cared about the project. I felt his heart and soul within every composition and frame. Before this film I use to be anti-3D but after I saw this, it completely changed the game for me, yes even more than \\"avatar\\" did. This was the first time I felt that the only way to experience this film was in 3d. even though this film failed at the box office, i feel as if i was part of something special because i was one of the few who saw it in 3d at the theaters. All those people who are going to rent it or buy it on DVD/blu ray will be missing half the experience in my opinion. Too bad for you guys!! And if there ever was a movie that would consider me to covert my home theater into 3d, it is this one.<br /><br />The way the film makers utilized slow motion was the best I have ever seen since the \\"Matrix\\", maybe even better. Lately I've hated the way recent films have used slow mo, just for the sake of it (Sherlock Holmes) but Dredd actually uses it to engross the audience further into the story. I loved the way the cinematography switched up during these scenes, making the drug scenes feel surreal and beautiful at the same time. That, accompanied with the amazing score, really made me feel like i was on a wild thrill ride. I haven't had this much fun at the movies in a while. This year has been a great year for movies. i loved \\"Prometheus\\", \\"Dark Knight Rises\\" and \\"Avengers\\" and even \\"Looper\\" but Dredd was the most fun and mind blowingof them all, despite it's simple down to earth story line. In fact I think it was the simplicity of the story that made it so great. It didn't try to have Dredd save the damn world. it was literally like watching John McClane in \\"Die Hard.\\" It was all about survival!!<br /><br />Karl Urban was great as Dredd. He really knew how to internalize all the angry emotions of the character and I commend his performance especially since we never got to see his eyes. He always retained a calm but ruthless demeanor. Lena Headey was chilling as Ma-Ma, I'm glad to see her still getting work after her underrated and beloved performance as Sarah Connor in the Terminator TV series (if you haven't seen that show, check it out, you won't regret it!). Olivia Thirlby did a decent job playing the rookie/dredd's side kick. At first I thought she was too young for the role but her character contrasted well with Dredd's character. At times I thought the made her appearance too pretty but she carried the role good enough to make me overlook that.<br /><br />If you like films such as \\"Die Hard, Robocop, The Crow, or Darkman\\" YOU HAVE TO CHECK THIS FILM OUT!! It's a true action film masterpiece that put's the Expendables to sleep! This is easily one of the best R rated films to come out in a long time. These days everything is PG-13 just so the studio can sell more tickets and it was like a breathe of fresh air to see all the action and gore done in a way that wasn't gratuitous but servicing to the story and suspenseful atmosphere the film was trying to create for the viewer. I haven't seen violence in an action film done this well since the 80's. Everything about this film is fresh and exciting. The only thing that I can nit pick about was some of the supporting characters (Ma-Ma's henchmen) acting was bit forced but what do you expect from a low budget film? This film is one of the best-low budget films ever made and proof that you don't need hundred's of millions to deliver the goods. i think the reason why people didn't check this out was because folks thought it was a remake of the the Stallone film. My god, how they were wrong! TOO BAD FOR THEM!! Even though in my opinion I feel that a non 3D version of this film won't be as good as the 3D one I'd still recommend it to anyone, whether 3D or 2D. I'm definitely purchasing this when it comes out!
0385344333|4.0|Jack Reacher returns in the A Wanted Man - the 17th entry in this series by Lee Child. And did I mention - one of my favourite characters and series!<br /><br />Reacher is former military police. These days he criss-crosses the country, going where the wind blows, no home and no baggage. But trouble? Well, it seems to find Reacher no matter where he is. And with his unerring moral compass, he can't help it - he steps up and steps in....<br /><br />This time he's hitch hiking in Nebraska. No one is stopping for him -the busted up face and the sheer mass of him puts people off. But then someone does stop and it looks like he's got a ride to Virginia with the two men and the woman in the car. (faithful readers will remember the voice on the other end of the phone that he wants to meet....) But Reacher's radar is alerted - something just doesn't seem quite right in the car....and what about the two roadblocks they drive through......<br /><br />The first third of  A Wanted Man is slower than previous novels. I liked how Reacher came his conclusion that something was wrong in the car. I enjoyed being privy to his thoughts on how and what he was going to do.  There's not as much physical action in this book as previous books, although the run up to the end is good and fulfills the kick ass Reacher quotient. Child inserts a good twist, just to keep us on our toes....and makes you wonder about the alphabet agencies and their agendas.<br /><br />Lee Child has created a character that appeals to all readers, men and women. He's the quintessential hard boiled hero. No backing down, his own set of morals and tough as nails. He has a firm moral compass, carefully delineated lines on what's right and wrong, but has no problem using questionable methods to get to the bottom of things. He's big, strong, smart and....well.... kinda sexy too.<br /><br />There have been quite a few readers who really truly disliked this book. I'm not one of them. It's different, but for me it was still a really good read.<br /><br />Reacher Creatures can rejoice  - the 18th book is in the works and to quote Child....<br /><br />.... \\"I have started work on next year's installment, titled \\"Never Go Back\\" Reacher finally makes it to Virginia and meets Susan Turner...but as you might imagine, he also runs into a world of trouble there. Let's hope he survives.\\"l a really good read.<br /><br />Reacher Creatures can rejoice  - the 18th book is in the works and to quote Child....<br /><br />.... \\"I have started work on next year's installment, titled \\"Never Go Back\\" Reacher finally makes it to Virginia and meets Susan Turner...but as you might imagine, he also runs into a world of trouble there.

1423140605|4.0|The Mark of Athena is the best in the series so far.<br /><br />The relationship with Percy and Annabeth is elaborated and for the first time we get to know Annabeth's thoughts, insecurites and aspirations as quiet a few chapters in the book is written from her perspective.<br />Leo becomes more than the comic relief. We see him taking a new role and see the possible tragedy he might have set in motion when his deal with a certain goddess of revenge goes all wrong.<br />Percy seems to be having trouble with his powers. The issue of his fatal flaw - his Achilles heel returns and he have to contend with it again.<br />The ending ends with a cliffhanger (literally).<br /><br />What I like about Rick Riordan is how he manages to merge symbolism with mythology with action packed, continous, sometimes funny, adventures that is steam punk hilarious and somberly didactic.
B00846REIS|5.0|I loved this book ad=nd could not wait until the next book came out.  It was hard to put down once I started to read it.

B008XG1X18|5.0|this app is just as beautiful on my kindle fire as it is on my macbook.  it is easy to use and I am so happy I can use it on the go on my android phone and kindle fire instead of just when I am at home on my laptop and its all sync'd nicely.
B0087HT36U|4.0|good game. pretty cool.  my bunghole itches. its Wednesday.  why does my bunghole always itch on Wednesdays? not quit sure.  oh well. itchy bunghole Wednesdays continue.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is one of my favorite games ; it is not hard to play and doesn't take forever to finish. eg win.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Absolutely loved this! Not as good as Season 1 IMO but still very entertaining and with lots of plot twists and turns. I simply CANNOT WAIT for Season 3. They didn't have Season 2 on Netflix so finding it on Amazon Instant Video made me sooo happy! The quality was wonderful and the ordering process was so easy.
B002MFX0RQ|5.0|This is a great movie. Original script that was first on Broadway. Jimmy Stewart is just one of the great actors in this movie. I highly recommend this great  great movie.
B0051UP5NQ|1.0|This is the second time it's broken after an update. Time to find a more reliable app.  They didn't give an option to downgrade.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|There is a lot of personal growth with the characters in this book, they take each other through the ringer but they come together with a twisted sense of peace.<br /><br />the timeline in the book is the only thing that throws me off, things fall apart and pick back up too fast, other than that I literally closed the book on my kindle opened the store up and preordered book 3.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is one of the most addicting websites I've ever been on. Anything you could want, recipes, crafty ideas, travel destinations, fashion, gift ideas, holiday treats, wedding ideas, anything and everything is on this website. It also gives you a chance to add sites/places/ideas that you want to share with others. A+! I've been addicted for months.
B008SVS3FC|5.0|I used to think I knew music. Can't believe I never heard of John Hiatt until the North Mississippi Allstars backed him up on a tour a couple years back. Never listened to any of his music until he released Dirty Jeans - that is now one of my all time favorite CDs. I have since bought ten of his albums.<br /><br />Mystic Pinball is a good one alright but there are several other of his CDs that I like more. That doesn't take anything away from this effort, it's definitely a good one, its just that he already has a boatload of good stuff out there. Many five star efforts.<br /><br />I recommend buying this CD - and about ten others from Hiatt.
B003XT60KO|5.0|This is a great book for explaining fundamental economics in easy to understand language. The lessons are timeless and will encourage further reading in economics. I recommend this book.
B0085A9J18|3.0|You might have thought you had seen it all: Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung, Jet Lee, Donny Yen and so on.  Not really.  Gareth Evans and his team came up with this simple premise, lean budget, unfamilar location, unknown actors but with weeks of intense tactical police training and just about the right amount of blood and violence, the filmmakers came up with some of the best choreographed hand-to-hand combat sequences, long, almost non-stop and never boring. 4 star for the action sequences, 2 star for the story and 3 star for the filmmaker's ingenuity and love of the genre.  Mike Shinoda provided the unobstrusive soundtrack.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|A short but thought provoking read encouraging the reader to self introspection.  It helps one to notice and take a different path on the road to life.
B008I34YYY|5.0|Yes, this is not a major theatrical release, but it does a lot with such a low budget. The FX are very good for the cost of the movie. The acting is excellent. They really tried hard. They call this a comedy, but I found it to be more of a dramady. Not too cheesy... very nicely done. Received my copy the Friday before the official release date. I know I will be watching this DVD again!
0525953728|5.0|LOVED THE BOOK! COULDNT PUT IT DOWN. RECIEVED IT QUICK. the quality of the hard back was very good! just want to say, i'am very happy with my purchase, and always have been!
B0081L391C|5.0|I heard about this video through a fellow friend and classmate of mine because I am in college for criminal justice and go figure I am watching a movie that surrounds this very subject! I myself have never seen many movies with either jonah hill or channing tatum but this movie is by far one of the funniest movies i have seen in a long time. In my ranks, it is right up there with THE ORIGINAL \\"Dumb and Dumber\\" because that is how good it was for me. I actually ended up purchasing it. I am sure glad that I did to. Now my only task is to ask my brother if he has seen it because he is a huge fan of jonah hill and his acting ways. Definitely a good purchase and worth the watch. it is as funny as it looks in the trailer. Trust me.
B004H7QICG|3.0|This is a very nice case.  It has modular removable HDD's  I can remove the middle rack and run a front fan there.  My case fans aren't the problem.  It's my video card.  It's loud as heck.  It's notoriously loud.  It's the galaxy geforce 460 or 470 I don;t remember.  It's really loud.  Now the omputer is less noisy than before, but I thought it would be more quieter.  I'm sitting in my living room and I can hear it running in my office right now.  That's not very quiet by anyone's standard.  So yeah I think the case should have been more quiet.  Apparently the layering technology used is not that effective.  Plus the stock fan on the top of the case let's noise from inside the case out.  I'm not sure that top opening is needed.  I was going to get a regular case and use sound dampening material until I saw this case, which advertised integral sound dampening panels.  I am somewhat disappointed in that regard.  But in every other respect this is a very nice case.
B002LATN9G|5.0|I happened to stumble upon this movie after watching 21 jumpstreet which also stars channing tatum. The plot to this movie was very well laid out and Terrence Howard does a good job portraying the agent. I was very pleased with the movie & plan on renting it again in the future if not buying it. It also stars Brian White (from Stomp the Yard)  who also is an amazing actor.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|It's a pretty cool and addictive game/app. It's definetly a better alternative to the real carnival game and a heck of a lot cheaper :p I like that they updated the original app and added a shake meter. When you collect enough coins you have the option to &quot;shake&quot; and get coins close to the edge.
B003JTHETY|5.0|I got the Mission Edition As soon as it came out, but I did not review until now;<br />As usual with any IRON MAIDEN release, you have an epic item. The mission edition, does look like something a space<br />explorer would get, and it gets all the treatment that the artists who do the image of the curtains and the t-<br />shirts create so superbly. The new \\"Eddie\\" in this space age version works very well in the concerts ( as you can<br />see in the later DVD showing of a LARGE version of Eddie that looks Gi-Normous).<br />  It is interesting to note that the  Album has been stated as NOT being a concept album. And Dave Murray said<br />it is not a H R Giger style of Eddie, and more a FORBIDDEN PLANET style of feel. It seems that Dave has a heavy<br />input for the way Eddie is depicted and t-shirts for FINAL FRONTIER certainly work out well. It seems that the<br />songs are more like artistic works that mean what the listener says they mean; sometimes it may mean something<br />specific ( Bruces influence is very strong). However, they talk about 7 songs in Paris came together, and then the<br />rest of the songs move together. I think that Nicko has summed it up well as a \\"DR WHO\\" type of moment that the<br />recording studio felt like home, \\"somewhere familiar\\". Dave comments that Nicko's feel for the drums were great and<br />he got the feel straight away. In Track 12 of the CD material ( Or what I downloaded with the Interviews), the info<br />on how they recorded the album was  very intriguing. The comment seems to be that it felt better having everyone<br />playing at the same time, they interact ( to quote Nicko). The feel of the MISSION version of the album package,<br />the metal case, is in line with the feeling of the album, and the album just sounds great. Adrian leads the writing<br />and playing in a major way, and everyone works the chemistry very well. All in all, it is another great MAIDEN<br />album made by the detail oriented guys and everyone worked in well.<br />  The songs speak for themselves. If you were not able to get the extras that were available at the time of original release, I hope you can get the items from I-Tunes or other collectors, since the bonus material was a great set of material. Once again It seems that what the nay-sayers have hit on must be a different album. The sound is good, sounds like the Tour DVDs, and works well with what they do, lyrically, Guitar wise, and in the all round sound, works well. At least they are consistent. consistently great. MAIDEN !!
0385344333|5.0|I've read all Jack Reacher books, and found this one of my favorites. Unlike some of the other<br />reviews, I loved what took place in the car. Jack's mind, or should I say Lee's, is always working.<br />He comes up with things that are obvious, but then why didn't I think of that? I am so sorry that<br />Tom Cruise is the actor who will portray Reacher. Total miscast. I did like Cruise in MI but this<br />is not a good part, and I doubt I'll even watch the movie. I have Reacher pictured in my mind and<br />I'll keep it at that. I would have loved to see Liam Neesen he would have been perfect. But as<br />far as this book goes, obviously you'll either love it or hate it. I loved it.
0385344333|4.0|I must confess, I have been on a serious mystery/thriller kick lately. Over the Christmas 2011 holiday season, my Dad, after much efforting (h/t to Dan Patrick for that word), finally convinced me to try out the Lee Child novels featuring an exciting character named Jack Reacher. Over the next five weeks, I read 17 full-length novels, along with a couple short stories featuring Reacher. I guess you could say I liked it.<br /><br />More recently, my sister got me reading David Baldacci's King & Maxwell series, and my friend Brandon convinced me to try the Vince Flynn books with Mitch Rapp (I've since learned that some other friends, Scott and Margaret, love these books as well.) I thoroughly enjoy both of these series, but I must say that at this point, the Reacher books are my favorite of this genre.<br /><br />And with that backdrop, I recently finished Lee Child's latest Reacher novel, A Wanted Man. I gave it 4 out of 5 stars over on Goodreads.<br /><br />I've grown to really enjoy Child's writing style (and yes, I'm well aware that some of these books may be written by ghostwriters), and this book continues using the same sometimes choppy text. The choppiness doesn't bother me, though, because the content is so good. And even in its choppiness, at least the grammar is proper, unlike so many others in this genre.<br /><br />Reacher, being his typical self, is hitching a ride in the central US and is picked up by three individuals who end up being a little more than he first expected. Our hero is full of random facts, like populations of cities, area codes, and, my personal favorite, the baseball statistics he rattles off for the aliases he chooses, all former Yankee players. This time it was Bill Skowron. Reacher is a great combination of incredibly tough, incredibly bright, and incredibly humble. It's really hard not to root for him, and your rooting is, of course, always rewarded. While the first half of this installment may have dragged a bit, the second half picks up the action and the intrigue, making this another terrific chapter in Reacher's grand narrative. If you love Reacher or just mysteries in general, I'd recommend A Wanted Man.
0385342063|5.0|This book is very entertaining. Like all of Sophie Kinsella's novels, I couldn't put it down.<br />It is funny but a little more serious than the Shopoholic series. You will love it if you love Sophie's other novels
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this is one of my favorite arcade games and now I can play it on my kindle fire. it is definitely a time waster, but I love it. may not be for everyone,  but it works for me! :)

B0083SBMBM|4.0|The Avengers is a truely excellent movie, even under it's own merits, and may just be my new favorite comic book/superhero movie to date. I'm not going to give too detailed a review, but as much as I liked it, and feel most fans of this genre will as well, doesn't mean it's perfect in story and plot. Although the movie's story was actually fairly close to the original Avengers's first mission Loki is still a weak antagonist and the 'puppet army' was a bit of a let down. However, I am willing to overlook most of the shortcomings I have perceived from this movie because I thoroughly enjoyed it! I rated the DVD four stars not because of the movie but the product as a whole because it doesn't have any deleted scenes, which I feel is just a ploy to get people to buy a BR player. Sorry, but I hate it when companies do stuff like that, especially Disney who doesn't need the money. I hope the success of this one doesn't cause a rush to make the sequel; I would be disappointed if it turned out bad.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Winter of the World is a well written, exciting, and overall enjoyable sequel to Follett's \\"Fall of Giants.\\" Follett manages to cover most of the major events of the build up to and resolution of WWII, and he does it with solidly developed characters that never feel like caricatures. In the book, Follett is able to cover a huge number of interacting viewpoints that give the reader insights into the complicated global politics that were in play in the 1930s and '40s.<br /><br />I'd heartily recommend this book to anyone who's a fan of history or has read the first book in the trilogy. I'm very much looking forward to the next one, although Follett has left himself quite a lot of material to cover.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|hard to stop even it's so simple! It reminds me of the arcade I went to over and over as a kid but I was scared to waste my quarters playing it!
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I appreciate a good story that brings a very old character into modern life.  A wonderfully captivating book that keeps you wanting more.  The Timekeeper is a book no harder to read than need be but releases a lot of emotion in the meantime.  I recommend this book to anyone.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The story is amazingly compelling, the characters are believable and likeable, the writing is always passable and at times very good, and the immersiveness of it is wonderful. In short, simply an awesome book.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Amazing book. I loved reflected in you, was not able to put it down. Now I am counting down the days until Entwined with you comes out. If you haven't read Barred to you, start there. I hope you all enjoy this series as much as I have!
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|I got the dvd on time. The dvd is in good condtion. I love it and I have been watching it many times. Thanks.
0767817478|3.0|3 1/2 Stars = Very Good<br /><br />\\"Godzilla\\" could do with out the corny love sub-story, & a few other corny things, but I really liked it. All the Japanese \\"Godzilla's\\" except the first & by far the best, had corny love stories & a multitude of idiotic film making, but I loved them!<br /><br />\\"Godzilla\\" is my favorite monster. I think the main reason so many hated the US remake was it was more of a remodel than a remake. It had little in common with the Japanese films, & that made all the true green scaled \\"Godzilla\\" lovers tempers go radioactive!<br /><br />So be it.
0316228532|5.0|Firstly,I am shocked to see so many bad reviews. I hope most of them are from people who expected Harry Potter, if not in genre, at least in feel : good will triumph, people have treasures in their souls no matter how hard they mutilate it etc.<br />For me,  publicists and JKR interviews have done their job to dispel those hopes, so I feel I went in knowing what to expect.<br />The book is not fantasy, it's the sharpest work of social observation I have read in a long time. Another reviewer was complaining about the ugliness of every single character, how they all lacked redeeming qualities. That's because they are all stripped -in best heterodiegetic narrator fashion- of all the pretenses and hypocrisies of the social animal, even the ones so deeply ingrained they do not admit to themselves. Old women do not get charity work to help others, they do it to feel self important and inflict their opinions on people forced to listen. Husbands and wives live inside bitter compromises. Conversations between families and old friends only consist of old routines that everyone's heard before, but pretends they never have, because real communication between them hasn't happened in years; a new subject ( the more morbid and shocking, the better) is an occasion for everyone to attest their self-importance, superior knowledge and general one-upmanship. \\"Perfect\\", model families have unresolved Oedipus complexes and harbor emotional monsters. The people of Pagford are only interested in themselves, but not out of self-love. Out of hatred for others. The quote that best captured them for me was one about the inability to perceive anything or anyone outside the tight, absurd routine of lives lived solely to uphold status, as real:<br />\\" You must accept the reality of other people.You think that reality is up for negotiation, that we think it's whatever you say it is. You must accept that we are as real as you are; you must accept that you are not God.\\"<br /><br />The book has a darker, more abject sphere of exploration (the drugs, paedophilia, self-mutilation, theft) which is further away from most our lives, but which is not less real. I cannot pretend that I know much about the everyday life of people affected by these inescapable issues, but the prose feels no less teeth-sinking accurate. And this is something this book has taught me and made me admit : I do not know,but I will no longer stand by when people who know equally little judge and condemn.<br />JK admits to having explored the two extremes of her life- the middle-class origins and the depressing and hopeless poverty she found herself in - through the lenses of her two obsessions, morality and death. She does that with her usual jeweler-like minutia, crafting prose and characters as carefully as the most precious gossamer fabric.
1416550550|5.0|I loved the intrigues and different eras covered in the book.  It was well written and a pleasure to read!
030758836X|1.0|Have just finished \\"Gone Girl.\\" Decently well-written ... nothing real; solid shock value.<br />A movie will certainly be made from this book: A carnival ride that quickly turns monster twisted psycho. If that's your thing, you'll love \\"Gone Girl.\\"<br />It's not my thing.<br /><br />Every once in a while a book comes along that makes me almost want to quit reading books, for good. Wally Lamb's \\"She's Come Undone\\" was one of those. This is another. Disturbing and mean-spirited. Really wish I'd never read it. By book's end felt like I'd watched a sleazy marathon of \\"Housewives of [City],\\" complete with an overdose of jealousy and rage. Had trouble sleeping last night with the scum my brain had just ingested; the opposite of a fulfilling read. Unforgettable, for all the wrong reasons.<br />--<br />Update: Read The Light Between Oceans by Stedman.  Read The Kitchen House by Grissom.  Read Little Brother by Doctorow.  I read those in the past few weeks, after having finished Gone Girl.  All three were wonderful.
0316228532|5.0|Full disclosure, I grew up with Harry Potter and so I am somewhat biased. While the first book came out when I was only seven, but by the time Harry was defeating lord Voldemort, we were both seventeen. I was part of the generation of children who halfway expected to get an owl on their eleventh birthday, and the name J.K. Rowling was, and still is, as magical as Hogwarts itself.<br /><br />I didn't know what to expect with The Casual Vacancy. I wasn't even sure that once magic was subtracted from the equation dear old J.K. would be able to write about real people and real issues, but oh boy, can she ever. This book is not for the faint of heart, it is not for the squeamish, and it is not for the casual reader. The people of Pagford, Yarvil, and the Fields are not very nice, nor are they very happy. Their lives are messy and ugly and so, so exquisitely human.<br /><br />My favorite books are the ones that make me feel things viscerally, sorrow, anger, joy, revulsion. And this book, so far it has made me feel all of that. It is wonderful to see Ms. Rowling, she of the authorial voice that most deeply defined my late childhood and teen years, use the cleverness with which she created a world of magic to examine the human condition through the lens of class struggle, familial abuse, and teenage frustration. Five stars, all the way.
B007MDQW3W|5.0|I am fairly certain that Regina is incapable of putting out bad material.  I know the older fans are mad because of the \\"studio\\" quality of the songs, or rather the \\"over produced\\" sound.  Frankly, I don't care.  I've seen her live, I've heard the rare and unreleased scratch tracks, and honestly, Regina is Regina is Regina.  This album is full of wonderful little gems of song.  \\"Ne Me Quitte Pas\\" has been stuck in my head since I bought this album three months ago!  Old and new fans alike should be able to enjoy the sonic soundscapes that Regina creates.  She's amazing, and I can't wait for the next new batch of songs!
B008673ZAQ|3.0|Bottom line, if you read the first should you read this - and then will I read the third?  Yes. But, not with the zeal of anticipation I had for this book.<br /><br />This book was a roller coaster for my emotions. Without revealing too much, I'll just say in discussions with a friend, while I was only halfway through, I said \\"here are my theories about what will happen - x, y and z.\\" I read two more paragraphs and realized x was true and kept reading to find that y and z were also coming true.<br /><br />The book was great, sure. But I guess I don't enjoy reading a book that as the reader, I can predict so well.  Even more annoying is when you know you're at the end of a book and are wondering about so many loose ends that need to be tied up and one person who has no role in the book comes in and wraps it all up in a perfectly understandable (albeit random and frustrating) ball.<br /><br />It's also amazing how many Christian Grey references were made - mergers and acquisitions being just one of them.  I couldn't decide if that was irony, or just a weird coincidence.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|Absolutely amazing yet again. Fast paced, highly intense, very erotic, AND GIDEON IS FREAKING SEXY. I literally sat down and did not move until it was finished. Can not wait until December 31st New years aught to be interesting.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|\\"Winter of the World\\", book number two of the \\"Century Trilogy\\", is a page turner. This is a novel full of passion, romance, tragedy, and war. It is a very political novel, explaining how Europe was unable to stop the march of fascism and why World War 2 broke out. The fates of the main characters seem to be revolving around the political affairs taking place in the world during the 20th century. I feel close to the (fictitious) persons described in the book. Their tragedies and their happiness touch my heart. We follow several stories in this novel, in countries like, for example, Germany, Britain, Russia and the USA. Stories that are interconnected. All in all, this is a very entertaining novel.

B005IQZB14|5.0|I am an avid voracious reader and only enjoy reading GOOD books!! Then to actually review  such book I really have to LOVE it or Hate it enough to actually write a review on it, so, I  thoroughly enjoyed reading this story!! Well written and very informative !! The writer really bared her heart and sole and put it out there (her story of loss) for everybody to see.  I give her kudos to make such a HARD journey from beginning to end and what a great ending!!!!  Congratulations, I don't think I could ever have undergone such a feat!!!
B0083SBJXS|4.0|I LOVED this movie in the theaters so much that I paid a bundle to see it twice, which I've NEVER done before!  I pre ordered and my copy finally arrived tonight.  I was super excited about the gag reel and deleted scenes.  I COULD NOT VIEW THEM as I do not own a Blue Ray player.  The blue ray disc won't play on my DVD player and those particular extras are only on the Blue Ray disc.  (I got the 2 disc blue-ray/DVD combo in Blue Ray packaging)  Luckily my sister has a blue ray player, so I'll get to see them eventually, but I was very annoyed at Amazon for being, what I thought, was pretty misleading about this detail.  I didn't read EVERY word on the description page, but if this info is on there anywhere, I certainly didn't see it when I ordered the disc.<br /><br />I also pre-ordered months ago and I was pretty disappointed that it took so long for my movie to arrive.  No, 7 days isn't forever, but I feel like Amazon was punishing me for not paying for expedited shipping.  LOVE the movie, disappointed in Amazon on this one.<br />Rating would have been 5 stars for the movie but I gave it 4 because I'm pretty upset that I didn't get to see the gag reel and deleted scenes tonight.  The rating would have been even less if I didn't have someone close by who's blue ray player I can use in the next few days!!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I absolutely love the pinterest app. I was very jealous when only apple had the app and was so excited when it was available in the kindle marketplace.
B004KBSQBA|5.0|I love Graceland and will never grow tired of it.  Hearing \\"I Know What I Know\\" upon walking into a record store on the High Street in Bury St Edmunds England is one of those moments forever etched in my brain.  It was startling, it was wonderful, it was a revelation.<br /><br />Much as I love this recording I do wish Paul Simon would come clean on his most celebrated work and give full credit to the work of the musicians and composers that enabled him to create this release, e.g., Johnny Clegg, Juluka, Los Lobos, etc.  Simon's explanation of the Los Lobos situation and The Myth of Fingerprints is just lame.  Conceptually, most of the album draws heavily the work of South African Johnny Clegg though he is credited in teeny, tiny print in the Special Thanks section buried deep in liner notes.  Graceland fans believe Paul Simon invented this hybrid, cross-over music but it really was the innovation of Johnny Clegg and his partner Sipho Mchunu.  They had been creating this very same kind of music with their band Juluka for many years prior to the release of Graceland.<br /><br />Most folks probably don't understand this or realize what went on here but musicians who like to dig and look for influence, connections and sources will easily uncover the truth behind these sessions.  Now, to be fair, I would never have discovered the incredible music of South African Johnny Clegg without the release of Graceland.  But...

B009FOBMBI|5.0|I have been waiting for the album for a very long time, October 2nd was a date I was looking forward to on my calendar for quite a while now.  I had high expectations for this CD and it lived up to those expectations.  I know from first listen that I'm going to end up singing along to a number of these songs after I learn them.  Also interesting enough I think the second half of the CD is better than the first half.  Close to the whole CD is going to make it onto my mp3 player which doesn't happen a lot.<br /><br />EDIT:<br />Upon listening through the CD a couple of times, I have some favorites.  All of the songs are pretty good, I however am not fond of tracks 9, and 10, however, the last three songs have to be my favorite chunk of songs though.  Here's a list of songs and my opinions on them:<br /><br />1. Sign Of the Times: (3.5/5) For some reason I don't even view this as a real song, even though it's the length of a song, to me it feels more like a drawn out intro.  The song doesn't even get going until half way through, not one of my favorites.<br /><br />2. Chalk Outline: (5/5) Very good beat with interesting lyrics, when it first got released as a single, it grew on me until eventually it reached 5 star status.<br /><br />3. The High Road: (4/5) Good song, but it doesn't particularly strike me as one of the most interesting songs on the album. Could be a possible radio song though.<br /><br />4. Operate: (5/5) This song doesn't sound particularly like a Three Days Grace song, but it is fun to listen to.  It's almost as if I feel guilty for liking this song.<br /><br />5. Anonymous: (5/5) One of my favorites on the CD.  Starts slowish but has a solid tempo through-out, and was one of my favorites upon first listen.<br /><br />6. Misery Loves my Company: (5/5) One of the most traditional sounding Three Days Grace songs on the CD.  Very good.<br /><br />7. Give In To Me: (4/5) Another solid song, slower paced, but also hard rocking when it needs to be.<br /><br />8. Happiness: (5/5) If you have listened to \\"The Good Life\\" from Life Starts Now enough to know how the song starts out you'll be confused every time this song starts out, because I swear it's the same exact sound to begin the song.  Lyrics are somewhat simple in this song, but it's very fun to sing along to so it reaches a 5 for that reason.<br /><br />9. Give Me a Reason: (3/5) The song is solid enough, but it doesn't live up to the quality of some of the other songs on the album.<br /><br />10. Time that Remains: (2/5) Least favorite song on the CD.  The word \\"campy\\" comes to mind when I hear this song.  It seems like a song that I would change the station on if it was playing on the radio.  That being said, I definitely could imagine it being played on the radio.<br /><br />11. Expectations: (5/5) I loved this song immediately.  The beat is so addictive, and the lyrics flow through the song very nicely.  For people who had a lot of expectations for this CD and were let down all I have to say is \\"Expectations go to Hell!\\"<br /><br />12. Broken Glass: (5/5) I like the beat of this song and it has very interesting lyrics having to do with our own flaws and mortality.  One of my favorites.<br /><br />13. Unbreakable Heart: (5/5) I actually think the CD would have gotten off to a better pace if Unbreakable Heart was the opening song.  Almost impossible to skip or eject the CD while this song is playing.  It is that good. Personal Favorite.r />8.

B008673ZAQ|4.0|This second story picks up the day after the last book finished. Eva and Gideon, continue to have trust issues in this story. Mostly in part because Gideon refuses to open up about his past. This frustrates Eva no end. The stress has caused the return of her nightmares. She has not had these for two years. Eva tries talking to Gideon, with no response.<br /><br />As the problems mount between the pair. Once again they use sex as a bandaid. But even this in the end stops working. But there are other things happening outside their control. Which is going to affect the two of them adding to their fragile emotions<br /><br />I spent most of the time reading this frustrated at Gideon, he refused to give Eva anything, all the giving was on her side. He just expected her to to trust him. But what he doesn't realise is that's not how things work. He blows hot and cold in Eva's eyes. I was shocked at the ending and what was revealed. I can't imagine where the story goes from here.<br /><br />I felt that there was so much happening in this story, behind the scenes, that the reader is not told. That made seem like there were two stories running side by side, but the reader is only privy to one of them. I would love to get something from Gideon's POV. For instance what about Corrine? Gideon knows that seeing him with Corrine, is like a red rag to bull to Eva. but he just keeps doing it. What happened with Gideon and Corrine? So many loose ends, that I would like answers to. Lets hope everything gets resolved in the last book.
B0058YPL66|5.0|I'm so happy I bought this show! Seriously one of my favorite things on tv right now. I'm glad I can watch it at any time now. It was very quick to get to me as well.
B008C1O8CA|5.0|I am a fan of all of Green Day's work. Uno! is not like American Idiot and 21st Century Breakdown. It more like Nimrod and Dookie mixed with Foxboro Hottubs. It's a fun loving album and catchy meaningful songs all the way through. Not a bad song on the cd!
B005D0RDIE|5.0|The DVD was awesome. Just as important, it is the best sounding DVD I have purchased to date. Rush is still going strong after 30 years. They are amazing. Neil Peart is the best drummer ever.
B007FG9LIE|1.0|Not the kind of book I like to read too much running around and too much violence that made little sense.
0470901071|5.0|Nice product teaches you ccna as well as real life networking. Would highly recommend this book as a primary study aid. Would have appreciated more practice questions.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This was a really good book.  Kept me very interested with all it's twists and turns.  Unfortunately, I really didn't like the ending.  It was just 'there' and kept you hanging.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book is amazing, it keeps you interested throughout and always throws something unexpected at you around every turn. I would easily recommend this book to anyone who appreciates a good book.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Have been waiting for this book for months, and it surely have been worth writhing fore!<br />The book picks up mostly where The Fall of Giants ended and it surely manage to describe the turmoil of the world in the years before the Second World War.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|This was another great read for me. The only concern I have is the book felt a little disjointed with views from 7 different demi-gods. The mark of arena plot was summed up nicely, although I do feel that Riordan threw out a red herring when he said Annabeth was going to be a problem for the quest. That was either nicely done to throw us off track or a forgotten plot element he didn't insert? Overall a good read. I giv e it 4.5 stars. And thumbs up for another awesome cliffhanger ending<br /><br />To all the kindle owners. There is a download or software issue that does not allow you to ha e a black background when reading because then all the words fade. Also at least for my copy, when I got exactly halfway through the ki.dos kept forceclosing kn the book I was forced to go out and buy the hard copy. I did try restarting the kindle, putting the book on cloud then re-downloading but nothing worked. I did not take away stars for this though as it had nothing to do with a plot just something amazon needs to fix with the formating
B008Z9YGEE|3.0|I didn't read the books so I am not sure if they were better.  The movie has a plot that is not very original and the special effects were not the best but the story does get you a bit hooked and nice to see fresh faces in Hollywood.
B000ID37SQ|4.0|Very violent movie, would not recommend for even individuals younger than 21. Excellent acting and direction but the character not worth it.
0385335997|3.0|Voyager is the third book in the Outlander series. It starts where Dragonfly in Amber left off. Claire has found out that Jamie survived the battle at Culloden. She, Roger Wakefield and Brianna set out to find what happened to him in the intervening twenty years. As they uncover tidbits about Jamie's life, the reader gets to see Jamie's perspective and more detail about what is happening to him. Finally, when they uncover where he is twenty years after Culloden, Claire has to decide whether to go back again or not.<br /><br />While Dragonfly in Amber used a lot of historical personages and felt more like historical fiction than Outlander did, Voyager is back to being more historical romance. But it isn't a romance novel as we think of them now. These novels are about a love that spans generations and can withstand an absence of twenty years. Claire and Jamie are both extremely powerful characters who are clearly (and literally) made for one another. Once they had met, nothing can stand between them. This book is about their rediscovery of each other, and dealing with the different people they've become after twenty years. These books are really about a relationship as it develops, not just the initial sexual attraction like most \\"romance novels\\".<br /><br />One thing I normally think Diana Gabaldon does well is tying the storylines together. I would read something on page 100 that I think is important but it wouldn't reappear and I would slowly forget about it. Then, it reappears out of nowhere and I would triumphantly think \\"I knew that was important!\\" while also acknowledging that she had me doubting it for awhile there. This technique kept me eagerly reading, trying to figure out clues to future events. However, it also sometimes comes across as a little too coincidental. Because Gabaldon uses foreshadowing so much, I figured out two twists way way earlier than the characters did. One of them, I felt like Claire should have figured out sooner as well and it bothered me that she didn't have any suspicions at all.<br /><br />The other problem I had with this book was with Jenny. I really liked her through the first two books as a strong willed female character. But I didn't like her in this book. Jamie and Claire return to Lallybroch and Jenny brings something to light that Jamie hadn't been honest with Claire about. This, I didn't have a problem with. Before Jenny explained her reasons to Claire, I honestly put it down to her forcing Jamie's hand because Claire had a right to the truth. But then Claire confronts Jenny about it, and here Jenny's explanation made very little sense to me. Jenny says that she did what she did because she was scared Claire would take Jamie away and Jenny would never see him again. But it is clear that Jamie would have had to leave anyway, without Claire ever returning and so Jenny's explanation makes no sense and is entirely out of character. She knows Jamie better than anyone and so she knows what Claire means to Jamie and how destroyed he would be if she left again. It just left me feeling like I didn't know Jenny at all and that she must be a much more petty character than I originally thought.<br /><br />Despite some issues that I had with certain parts of this book, I ended up enjoying it. Claire is just a great character. I really like reading about her. I also think I am going to like Brianna so I'm looking forward to Drums of Autumn in which she plays a bigger part.
0451228375|4.0|While not a typical Follett reader, I did enjoy \\"Pillars of the Earth\\".  This isn't really a sequel, as two story lines completely divided and unrelated (other than similar locations, though hundreds of years apart).  If you enjoyed \\"Pillars\\" then you'll enjoy this as well.  Terrific character development.  Reader feels invested in their outcomes and anxious to see what happens next.
B009G8GRX6|1.0|i was hopeful when i saw this new cd came out, especially as i knew nothing about it. i found quite a few of muse's old music quite original and refreshing, but now i don't know. another on this site named Atticus as i read it, gave an unfavorable review, but i always keep an open mind. however, this person was right in this regard. though there are likely some who disagree, their opinion is respected but not to my interest. if you are a fan of muse, but not of digital retro late 70's early 80's vibe music, stay away from this one, it's not worth the time or effort to pay it any mind.
B000TU16GS|3.0|i've seen and read much better.the book was enjoyable be less sirous and more funny.if you read the sires it's a hit or miss
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Wanted to read before seeing the movie, hopeing it wasn't like the tear-jerker the notebook turned out to be.  Wasn't disappointed.  Easy read, good romance with all the complications of the modern family.  Wanted to throw it at the end, but couldn't as it was on my Kindle, so read the epilogue.  Glad I did.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was way more than I expected. I typically read the books from the New York Times BestSeller list. Reading the summary I didn't know if I would be into it but I definitely was. Even if you are skeptical, just try it! It's so worth the read!
B009329ZF2|4.0|Every now and then you just want to sit and be entertained.  I appreciated that there was not full of gore.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|it is great. it always works and i rarely have problems worth it(: Plus its free which makes you want to get it even more!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Absolute perfection in a puzzle game. Deserving is 5 stars. The first rendition of this game is to notch and what a great follow up title. The difficulty had ramped up quite a bit. All the puzzles are unique.<br /><br />Pros. Difficult but with an easy learning curve. Awesome presentation with an excellent follow through and smart oversight to keep you coming back.<br /><br />Cons. Permissions are steep with Facebook connection and see constantly bantered to join their community... I love the game but begging for likes are in poor taste and frustrates me.<br /><br />With only one flaw (as where most games fail, internet community bantering) get this game! It will not disappoint.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|A longtime Follet fan, book two in his new trilogy does not disappoint. His research is always impeccable, his story and characters multidimensional.  Winter of the World is a great read.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I starting reading the book as soon it was out (last week as I am writing this). Great to read this romantic book and learn this part of history. It is really nice to read how it is going with the characters which I have been reading about in the Follet book which has preceded this book. I am a real fan of his writing and this is again a fantastic read. I will recommend the serie to my sons so they can learn a little history which having a good time. Thanks Follett and I hope you will come out with the last book of this trilogy soon!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book is just as good as the first and we learn more about Gideon's control needs as we watch his and Eva's addiction for each other grow. More character development for all the main players here is handled very well. Sylvia knows how to draw you into her stories. I started reading at 2:30 today and finished at 9:00 because I just could not put it down.  Thankful I am to be retired as I really would hate to have read it in spurts.  Learn more about past events that shaped Gideon and Eva as well as Cary.  More tension in this one for all characters and surprising developments.  The ending will be a surprise to some but if you read carefully you will most likely figure it out before the last pages.  Can't wait for Entwined With You.  These two need to be with each other. They complete each other. Buy it in any form you want but by all means don't miss it.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The plot and characters in The Fault in Our Stars are great. I absolutely loved this book. The story behind it is beautiful.
B002SAUCBC|5.0|A must read for fans of Stephen King.  Although the ending is a bit abrupt.  Its a very good book<br />.
B008XG1X18|4.0|i enjoy this app very much.. perfect for when i need quick access to recipes and late nights when i am in bed getting ready to pass out...
B0097EWK3A|3.0|good graphics, played it on expert. got to the church, didn't have enough angel heads, tried to back out to the main road. the game froze, went back to kindles homescreen and when I tried to go back in the game it had me stuck telling me to select glimmering objects that were not there. no way to buy pass the tutorial message, since it seems frozen.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|this was a great game for my fire. interesting enough and i like the skip mode for puzzles i couldnt solve.
0345803485|1.0|I read this book out of curiosity, only. My daughter and a family friend were briefly discussing it, and since I had not read it and it was considered popular reading, I chose to do so. Bad choice. I thought it was completely unrealistic and the writing was poor to say the least. It was overly long, and full of repeated, adjectives, exclamations, ad infinitum. Too much filler, not enough substance and barely a plot. I've come to the conclusion that it is primarly directed toward the 20-30's generation. Way to silly, and nonsense for me.
0307742539|5.0|Again I really enjoyed this book.  Stieg Larsson was a very inventive writer.  I would think I had the story figured out and it went in an entirely different direction.  That to me makes for a great read.  I liked the fact that he took the effort to tie the story together in the end, when it could have ended in any number of places.<br />It kept me reading much later than I should have.  Enjoy.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|Love SOA. Still trying to decide if I like the \\"previously on SOA\\" part of the dvd but love it anyway!
B008B1VYP0|5.0|Maroon 5 never ceases to amaze me. I have purchased every single album of theirs and have never been disappointed. Maroon 5 makes the kind of albums where I can listen to the whole album all the way through and love every song. I highly recommend getting this album. They did an excellent job.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I never write reviews for anything really...but this series has turned out to be my favorite book series.  Even better than Fifty Shades!!  I love how Eva stands up to Gideon and takes charge of the situation in this book.  I love how Gideon finally opens up and lets her in!!  Heck, I cried reading this book..and Fifty Shades was the first book I had done that with!  I can not wait for December for book 3...I'm only sad that it will be the end of the series!  I loved loved loved this book!!
0316228532|3.0|Once you get past the novelty of a beloved children's author using vulgarity and narrating drug use and sex, the book is relatively mundane.  The plot lumbers along at a moderate pace, introducing characters of the town of Pagford and outlining their situations.  While Rowling excels at character development, the townsfolk in this novel are unsavory, bordering on detestable.  Junkies, wife beaters, ambitious small-town politicians, despondent wives, and horny teenagers make up this cast.  Once everyone's intrigues are presented, the pacing slows down for the latter two-thirds of the book until the last 40-ish pages.  There's a mildly tragic and somewhat climactic conclusion, but by the end, I just wanted to be finished.  There were some decent little sub-plots and some deserving characters got their comeuppance, but the daily minutiae of Pagford was monotonous.<br /><br />Rowling's character development succeeds, no doubt.  The universe she creates here was tedious without magic, and wasn't as engaging as the vast and original creation that we love her for.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this is a very addictive game. I downloaded it a few days ago and haven't been able to put it down. the price was right as well!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|It is not the most well written story and there are better or more informative stories written by ex Navy SEALS, but the first hand account of the raid on OBL is very interesting and worth knowing.
B002ZG98C8|5.0|Well, out of all the fake trailers from grindhouse double feature Machete was expected as it was Steven Segal & Robert DeNiro in a movie together was more that brought others to be aware about. I never got to see it in theaters, thanks
B0087HT36U|4.0|Loving the game but I cant get gold on 2-28 and its really irritating. Because of that board it gets a 4. Would have been a 5.
B0011Z10PC|5.0|Is what I think this album is, Green Day at his best, even better than Dookie IMAO.<br />Thats it, this is a must. Buy it, steal it, if you havent listened yet...Do it now!!!
1423140605|5.0|First off, it was well worth the wait. Secondly, I would say that is the best installment in this series so far. I found each of the four points of view in the book to be interesting, and providing a fun and unique take on what was happening. The story is well paced never feeling slow or going too fast, and many encounters beings of myth are (as always) informative and interesting. I loved the reunion scene, and was very glad that one doesn't have to wait long to get to it. As for the ending it was, well, both amazing and perfect - infuriating in the extreme of course (always is), but still an amazing ending, and book 4 can't come soon enough.
0525953728|1.0|written by a senior in High School during study hall. Very sophomoric writing.  This SEAL sure does make himself out to be the \\"be all,end all\\"<br />hard to believe the story from a man that gave his word he would not tell any of the secrets of any training or mission info on ANY mission.<br />Must have been written at the behest of the Govt. to cover their real tracks
B008FPZQQU|4.0|Assuming that most ELP fans will be purchasing this album for the twentieth time exclusively for the surround mix disc, you should be warned that you won't get the entire album in surround format.  While there are plenty of reasons for the ELP fan and completist to get this version, it probably wouldn't be for this new mix on its own.  The net effect of What's-His-Name's remix is that of a sort of \\"exploded diagram\\" of the album, which reveals that the sum of its parts, more discernible though they may be, do not rise to the level of the original two-channel masterpiece.  There's some exciting bonus material (which ELP fans have been told for years didn't exist) which will probably be worth the quite reasonable price of this three-disc set, but keep your expectations grounded: ultimately, this is at its core another reissue of a forty-year-old analogue recording, not the second coming of Art Rock.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|this app is challenging and very fun it does not produce glitches or freezes. you will forget about time and keep playing so keep a check on the time. I think everyone should hag this app.
1416955070|4.0|This was a weird book to read. Let me explain. The burgeoning romance between Jace and Clary seemed to be sickening sweet. The descriptive parts about the Clave and everything else was minimal. And, on a technical basis, I didn't think the book was terribly well-written. Yet, for some reason, I found myself hooked by it. It was reasonably fast-paced and addictive in its own way. And I know she fleshes everything out in later books. So I gave it four stars because there was something in those pages that made me want to read and I'm not sure what it was.

1591396190|5.0|There are a lot of valuable comments (both positive and negative) about Kim and Mauborgne's book already so I was reluctant to share my own thoughts. But here's what potential buyers will want to know:<br /><br />This is a great book for entrepreneurs and small business owners. I list it among my top 10 business books that every entrepreneur should own because it offers a practical framework for actionable business improvement. I can attest to its significant value in offering a practical, actionable way for small businesses to be more competitive. I've used these methods in my own business and with some of the clients I work with and have always been happy with the results.<br /><br />I love strategy books but they are often high-level and focused almost exclusively on larger businesses. So there aren't a lot of takeaways that are practical/actionable or useful for the small business. Where other strategy books fall short is exactly where I feel 'Blue Ocean Strategy' excels. Readers get a simple, useful methodology to make positive changes to their business. The Strategy Canvas gives business owners a way to compare their business to competitors and then there's the Four Actions Framework to help business owners know how to make those changes.<br /><br />Simple. Straightforward. Useful. ACTIONABLE.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|This season is one of the best for SAMCRO. the battle for leadership of the club, fighting off foriegn and domectic fows and the battle of the old ladies. This season has it all, with the typical twist and turn thrown in, you will love it<br /><br />Regards Wayne
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I am a little disappointed in the effort on this book.  Not a good way to end a great story.  It was like the author was trying to drag out some nonsensical garbage because she couldn't come up with anything better or more creative.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|This indicator works well for me and is a great help when charging the kindle fire and also when managing battery usage! Check out the many features it has with telling you how warm your battery is and how much you would have left if you read
B0086700CM|5.0|really enjoyed the game grandson enjoys it as well. He can't put it down.would love to seee more versions of this game
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Some music is good, some music is fair, some music is tolerable, and once in a while you come across music that is truley inspiring and just plain blows your mind. This album does just that! Been a fan of them on youtube for a while, glad SONY finally noticed them!
B004I8WD7S|5.0|I've bought a few of these for different iPhones that I've had and traded. Fits great. Protects enough for my tastes. I'll buy again if I need another one.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|This is a fine choice for any level player. Great when a chess partner is not available. Nice graphics and no hiccups.
0345803485|1.0|I can not believe this book is a best seller.  It is poorly written and sets womankind back by at least a century.  I was furious at myself for even picking it up to read.  The character in this book acts like a 13 year old girl with a crush on her teacher.  It is boring, stupid, and repetitive.  However, the positive thing about this book is that it gives hope to all would-be-authors out there that anyone can write a best seller.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|All I can say is, move over Christian Grey, there's a new man in town. After reading Bared to You I was instantly hooked and could not wait for the second book to come out on October 2nd. Bought it last night, started reading and finished it a few minutes ago. Reflected in You was even better than the first. This book will make you laugh, make you cry, be pissed and at the same time fall in love with both of the characters. Cannot wait till December 31st when the third in this series, Entwined in you is release. I can't imagine it getting any better but I'm sure with this Author somehow she will make it just as delicious!
0062060562|4.0|The premise of this book intrigued me and the writing was equal to the task. The process of discovery for both the reader and the main character are addicting and the pacing made me want to keep reading faster and faster. I enjoyed the twists, found some of the imagery a little off at times though true to the character. Overall, a captivating fast read.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This was a very good follow on to \\"The Hunger Games.\\". As with the first book it was hard to put down.  A great reason to continue to read the trilogy.
0345525558|5.0|The premise of this book captured my attention but even then, I didn't really know what to expect. What I found surprised and intrigued me, a story of forgiveness and redemption, but more, a story about how someone can change their own life regardless of the circumstances. This is a beautiful book.
B007TBZ63Y|3.0|It keeps quitin on me that why I rated it so slow thye need to fix me i am in suspense!!
0307744434|5.0|I love a book that can pull me into its world and make me fall in love with the characters. This did and beyond and my only sorrow is that I am done reading it.
B00932A2MC|4.0|I liked this movie, but it still did not have the on the edge of your seat from beginning to end that I like. They spent to much time on the characters at the start.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Sorry dear but I am reading about Christian and Anastasia-I'll be right with you.................yeah right.<br />4 hours later after book is done then I re-entered reality. Loved reading this book!
B003UESJH4|5.0|Aside from the fact that I love Colin... this movie is fantastic and ofcourse he is a fantastic actor. I would recommend this movie to everyone! It keeps you going and has a lot good points. I think it has many of the real facts about the king as well...
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Best thing ive used on my kindle since I got it. great app. I LOVE IT!! a little sketchy with the cookies filling too fast
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|This is just a perfectly well made movie, it had so much meaning in it with how things were for the help! I loved this movie and I would recommend it to all. It was a great ending and I hope they make more movies like this.
B008IJHIAA|4.0|I haven't bought or listened to this reissue, so no comments about sound quality, nor about the merits and virtues of the original album itself. Just a note that the live set on disc 2 omits 5 songs from the performance. This live set was widely bootlegged in the late '80s, usually under the name \\"Red Rain.\\" Interestingly, the missing tracks are all covers -- in addition to requiring pressing a third disc, obviously there were royalties to consider. The missing tracks are \\"Superman,\\" \\"Strange,\\" \\"Fun Time,\\" \\"Harpers,\\" and \\"Time After Time/Red Rain.\\"
B002LC2DQ4|5.0|This card was recommended by my camera manual.  It is not inexpensive, but it can hold a good amount of pictures or video.  It did not come with any instructions, but only fit into the camera one way.  So far, I have no complaints.
0767812166|5.0|There are also gentleness, sweetness, innocence, forgiveness, grief, sadness, joy ... put all that together and you get one of the best movies ever (not only in science fiction) Jeff Bridges performed here the best role of his career. and John Carpenter created a true classic, highly recommended, I love it!
B008G12ERC|1.0|***A note before reading***<br />I have only listened to this album once.  This is a judgment based on first impression. If you are the sort of person who thinks albums must be listened to hundreds of times before they can be evaluated and are going to question my subjective opinion on this work, please stop reading now.  I don't care about your album reviewing methodology.  I know mine.  If you want to know it as well, read the comments below.<br /><br />Now without further ado, the original, unedited review.<br /><br />Wow.  I am a huge Muse fan from way back, and I have gone along for the ride. One of the things I liked about the band is that every album was different but still amazing in its own way.  You could hear them progress and grow as artists.<br /><br />Needless to say, I was excited when I found out about the new album.  Then I heard the single \\"Madness\\" on the radio and cringed a bit.  I took a deep breath and figured it would be the worst song, as bands often put the most commercially accessible track out as the first single (Muse has done this in the past).<br /><br />So I just listened to the album all the way through, so this is fresh on me.  My review may change with time, but right now, this album is mostly unlistenable.  It is crap.  I mean, crap to the crap power.  Apparently, sometime between dating Kate Hudson and writing songs for Twilight, Matt Bellamy stopped making music and started let his cat dance on a MIDI controller.  The album has no logical progression, no arc, and no memorable lyrics or music.  It is a cacophony of pointless, repetitive sound.  The first song on the entire album that made any good impression is \\"Animals.\\"  It at least sounds like music.<br /><br />And from there, it just gets whinier.  Apparently since Bellamy feels the world is ending, he doesn't have to try anymore.<br /><br />Also, Chris Wolstenholme, you are a good bassist, but there is a reason (or at least there used to be a reason) Bellamy writes the songs.<br /><br />***UPDATE***<br /><br />After a night to sleep on it and a few more listens through the album, I am certain it sucks.  It is repetitive, boring, and lacks the creativity of their previous works.  The composition is often elementary and frequently downright bad.  I understand the idea of fighting back against established standards of music (which is what I believe they are trying to accomplish), but they do not do it in an exciting, intelligent, or pleasurable way, instead only giving evidence as to why those standards exist and have been so successful.  When I think of groups that broke the mold successfully, I think Psyopus, King Crimson, Rush...and this attempt by Muse fails by a large margin compared to them.  The production is often so synthesized and enhanced that it is often difficult to determine where the music is.  The lyrics are mostly cheesy and all have the same message.  This album is very heavy handed on message and light on enjoyment.  This album sounds like a bad band trying to make their own version of Muse's \\"The Resistance.\\"  Here is specifically why on a track by track basis:<br /><br />1.  Supremacy<br />  This song attempts to be good, but sounds like a bad tribute to many bands before them.  The intro is quite reminiscent of Zeppelin, the drum beat is a standard march, and the addition of chorale vocals is a shout out to 80s music such as Bowie and Michael Jackson; there is nothing original about this song.  I will say that the guitar solo has a nice tone, but does nothing exciting or special, just replaces the lyrics.  The lyrics almost breach the topic of revolution, but do not actually ever produce anything of substance and rather just whine about the state of global policy.  The only variation is a slight quickening of pace at the end; besides that, it is repetitive and not produces no sort of affect.  This is the beginning of a song repeated 3 times with no arc.<br /><br />2.  Madness<br />  Are there even any real instrumentsin this song?  It is pure electronic music, and not particularly creative at that.  It sounds like 16-bit video game travelling music.  The lyrics are boring and the attempts at vocal harmonization fail.  The solo is choppy and disconnected, but not in a way that makes sense; rather, it seems like they included the wrong take in the mixing process.<br /><br />3.  Panic Station<br />  This is a poor attempt at making a funk track that would have been relevant in 1968.  That said, it is one of the better composed, more coherent, connected songs on the album.<br /><br />4.  Prelude<br />  A pretty little melody.  An interlude of sorts...but it does not function as either an interlude or a prelude. I don't understand it's position or purpose.<br /><br />5.  Survival<br />  This sounds like a song that very little thought went into.  The piano and voices are repetitive and boring.  The lyrics are forced and cheesy, and the rhymes are straight out of a grammar school book.  It is no secret that this song was commissioned for universal commercial appeal.<br /><br />6.  Follow Me<br />  An over-produced, repetitive, electric dance club folly.  They have done this successfully in the past on each of their last two albums with \\"Resistance\\" and \\"Map of the Problematique,\\"  but this song fails in comparison to both.<br /><br />7.  Animals<br />  This song is actually a song.  It has some depth in the composition, but the lyrics miss the mark.<br /><br />8.  Explorers<br />  This song slows it down and provides competent, if simple, orchestral arrangements.  One of the few tracks that is actually a song that progresses and develops. This is the closest thing to a memorable track.<br /><br />9.  Big Freeze<br />  By this point, I was thinking \\"If I hear 'Don't give up' one more time, I am gonna scream,\\" and sure enough, there it is...  Didn't I just hear this song like 6 times in a row?<br /><br />10. Save Me<br />  The music for this track sounds just like Moby's \\"Signs of Love.\\"<br /><br />11. Liquid State<br />  A little bit harder, but sounds like a bad rip of \\"Unnatural Selection\\" musically.  Chris Wolstenholme's singing is lacking any type of depth or feeling.  It sounds very forced.<br /><br />12-13...these are not songs.<br /><br />So there you go...
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I have followed The Piano Guys since the mash-up of Taylor Swift's Love Story, and Coldplay's Viva la Vida.<br /><br />They are simply amazing. Their arrangements and renditions of Pop music combined with Classical Music cannot be matched.<br /><br />Their YouTube channel has provided me hours or audio enjoyment and I'm glad to have purchased their first album.<br />It has not ceased to disappoint, considering I'm on my 3rd full time through and studying in my U's library.<br /><br />I hope them nothing but happiness and success, and it's so very refreshing to see how much enjoyment that they put into their performances, which directly affects me as a listener to how powerful and passionate their music is.<br /><br />Buy this, you won't be dissapointed. $10 is a nominal fee to pay for such amazing music and I am exuberant at the fact that I am supporting them!
B007THA4FI|4.0|The residents of Pagford are a motley bunch of upper, middle and working class people all stumbling through life as best they can while expressing the weaknesses and longings of humans at their worst. The most sympathetic character makes his presence felt in absence. Like Rowling he experienced the extremes of life and came up trumps fighting against ignorance, pettiness and bigotry. Many of the other characters have few redeeming features but enough of them grow for the ending to be satisfying.<br /><br />Initially the number of characters and their inter-relationships makes things a little difficult to follow but they quickly differentiate so stick with it.<br /><br />For five years Rowling has worked on a variety of projects including the Harry Potter films, The World of Harry Potter, Pottermore (NightGold50) and several books. She could have chosen to publish her political children's book as her first post-Potter work but instead she has leveraged her immense popularity to get her rich experience of life into the public realm. Many Potter fans will be grown up and ready to have their eyes opened in this far more direct and realistic way. Many of the themes are similar but instead of cloaking reality in a veil of magic Rowling removes the silken gloves and hits hard.<br /><br />The realism of the characters left me asking myself, \\"Which of these am I like?\\" and the genius is, I'm like none of them and all of them. The insight into human nature reminds me of Joyce's \\"Dubliners\\" or Gogol's \\"Dead Souls\\". It is dark and revealing, disturbing and true. I admire J K Rowling for writing and publishing this revealing book. Read it and open your eyes if you dare.
B008G12ERC|4.0|I'm a serious Muser, so there was no question I was going to buy this album.  When the trailer came out with a bit of Unsustainable several months ago, I loved it..heavy riffs, dubstep with real instruments, sounded good to me, and I don't listen to much electronic stuff or dubstep in general.  Then Survival, which is over the top and made me smile. This is one of those Muse songs that people have been hating, but it's so much fun, and the band isn't taking themselves too seriously here.  When Matt sings, \\"I'll never lose\\" on the second verse, you can practically see the smirk on his face.  Then came Madness...which everyone from Rolling Stone to Chris Martin seems to love. On my first listen, I thought \\"What the hell is this crap? Are they kidding?\\" I was worried I wouldn't like The 2nd Law much. However, there have been other Muse songs that I didn't like at first (Filip, Knights of Cydonia, even United States of Eurasia), but after 2-3 listens I LOVED them.  With Madness, it took 30-40 listens on the radio (yes, really, that many) before I finally liked it.<br /><br />My first impression of the full album was good, but it's definitely not as good as any of their previous albums. That doesn't mean it isn't good though, I will probably like it more and more as time goes on.  Supremacy is a great track, sounds like Muse which is what I had hoped.  Madness, I like, but it took a while to get there.  Panic Station is an very groovy funk track with a very 80's feel and I loved it right away. I love Survival, but I wish the beautiful orchestral intro was not a separate track, it should've been one longer track instead.  I loved Follow Me, a sweet song about Matt becoming a father and I like all the synth-y stuff. Animals, Exporers, and Big Freeze are all good songs, but it all gets a bit slow during these songs, I wish they rocked a little harder.  I'm still a bit meh with Explorers, and Big Freeze sounds so much like U2, you'd think The Edge is playing guitar instead of Matt. I'm sure this one will grow on me, though.<br /><br />When I found out Chris wrote and sings lead vocals on 2 songs on this album, I wasn't sure how I felt about it.  What's a Muse song without Matt's insanely amazing vocals? They are both good songs, Save Me kind of a slow song (again), but with great lyrics.  Chris said in an interview that Matt was excited about not singing so he could really go crazy on guitar with Liquid State..this is one of the heavier tracks on the album, its great,but it could've gone a lot farther. Matt, WHERE'S THE GUITAR SOLO??  All I can say is he better really go crazy with this one when they play it live.<br /><br />With Unsustainable and Isolated System, I think they are both excellent, so sick!! Unsustainable finally rocks hard where the other songs were lacking, however on both songs I would liked more of Matthew's voice and less of the talky British news lady. Isolated system is just beautiful.<br /><br />Overall I like this album quite a lot.  But, in comparison to Origin of Symmetry, Absolution, Black Holes, even Resistance, it just doesn't quite measure up.  Listen to Madness, then listen to Citizen Erased, Hysteria, or Map of the Problematique.  You can't tell me Madness, or any song off this album, frankly, is their best work, because it's just not even close.<br /><br />ADD ON: At this point I've heard the album a couple more times, it's getting better and better each time.  Muse rules!
B0098VXE50|5.0|Fabulous movie. Loved kristen Stewart. Ordered one day and received the next with prime. Love it. Not for small children, otherwise awesome movie.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Enjoyed the suspense. Movie was a bit different than the book. Books are always better. Cant wait to read the other books in the trilogy.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Once again Ken Follett brings history to life with the story of the events that lead up to and include the Second World War.<br />The characters are the second generation to the Fall of Giant characters and are just as interesting. He manages to weave each<br />character into a storyline that creates fictional interaction within the framework of history. Like all good authors he makes us care what happens to each character.<br />His depiction of Europe, England and Russia in the lead up to war is riveting - if not uncomfortable... in hindsight one wonders how this could have happened.<br />His explanation to why America took so long to enter the war is clear but I found the attack on Pearl Harbour not as descriptive as the<br />other events he writes about. I also did not like how he placed certain characters in that event. One thing is certain it is a compelling, well written book that<br />keeps you reading late into the night.I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good read but most importantly it will<br />give those not schooled in history a snap shot of what happened during those years. I look forward to Book Three!
B008673ZAQ|4.0|So much for reading slow, I finished the book in 5 hours. I will go back and reread it because I read quicky.  Although there was more storyline in this book, there was more fighting and less sex.  The Sex between Gideon and Eva is what made the first book so powerful.  Don't get me wrong I did like book 2, but I think I liked book 1 better.
B0088RQ4X4|3.0|I liked it. I know many did not! It was a good yarn for the small screen and it told the story well. A very well played out story that == somewhat predictable -- was fun to watch.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Lives up to original high expectations. Follett's craftsmanship is flawless, story is fluid and engaging. Only caveat is to read \\"Fall of the Giants\\" first to best appreciate the character development.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|This case does exactly what I need it to do--protect my Kindle Fire HD and holds the KF so I can watch videos.  The cover is thick enough to offer protection, yet flexible enough to easily move about to get it into position.  Nice case for the price.  I'd buy it again and I'd recommend it.
B0083Z3O8Y|5.0|Wow. I watched the movie before I read the book and just love what Jane Austen does to make this wild woman come to life.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|A Wanted Man gave good insight to how government types work - some with open minds and some with no thought processes at all. Good descriptions of parts of the country that I am familiar with. I'm looking forward to find out how close Reacher gets to Viginia in the next book. BTW, the short story published in Kindle only was wonderful!
B0069JBKHI|1.0|The camera looks good and has tons of good functionality.  HOWEVER, the main functionality - remote connection to the mobile app for remote monitoring - does not work reliably!  The mobile app keeps losing connection to the camera and the camera has to be restarted manually at least once a day.<br /><br />Without remote monitoring, this is a very beautiful lullaby player and thermometer - things I would not pay $300 for :)<br /><br />Costumer service for Withings is non-existent, which is unacceptable for such an expensive product.
B004I744AS|4.0|I have a wonderful son who has problems in school and 90% of the apps are for kindergarteners etc so of course a 12yr old won't get any help there but this is woo much fun ( hang man,  spelling bee, word within word facts etc..) I find that between me, my husband &amp; my 15yr old we have to schedule time to play games!  LOL!!!
B005C0DHEY|1.0|Overall informative but lacks more global picture of the impact of fracking, and the overall quality and presentation is not very good.
B0084IG7KC|2.0|I love the movie and the blu ray is great, however this gets 2 stars because the digital copy is via ultraviolet which after several days still won't let me even get past the create an account page to download the movie.  What's wrong with just doing the digital copy on a disc with a code to unlock it?
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|Prometheus is simply a sci fi movie concept of late 1970 early 1980's with 21st century cinema tech.<br /><br />Yes this is a real sci fi delight, every singlemoment grandiosity of  the  ship , and  cinematograpghy captures you.<br /><br />No way If you never forget Alien 1979, you will fall in Prometheus 2012.<br /><br />Ridley Scott is master of sci fi.
B007NCSQFO|5.0|This album is hot. I like each and every one of the tracks. Great to work out to or just to play in your car.
B003G4W49C|5.0|i loved the plot of this book.  i didn't really see the end coming.  the book was brutal, honest, and without compassion.  the classic example of the ends justifing the means.  I can't wait to read the next one!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Ken Fallett creates a picture of life in Europe and Russia that is so life-like you feel like you have just lived there at that time by the time you finish the book.  His description of life in German between the wars and during and after WWII is captivating.  I almost feel like I have lived in Russia from the revolution to the end of WWII.  I can't wait for his next one.  Will it take me to Korea and Viet Nam?  Or will it include the 6 day war and the Yom Kippur war in Israel?  The Hungarian uprising in 1958? Will it go into the cold war?  Life in Germany and Russia after the \\"iron curtain\\" fell and Pershing missiles and Scud missiles were pointed at each other? I can hardly wait!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I've read all three books and it was an overall good series of books.  I recommend this book to anyone interested.
0525953728|5.0|This was a fantastic read [[ASIN:0525953728 No Easy Day: The Firsthand Account of the Mission That Killed Osama Bin Laden]].  The book was well written and the author made it an action packed account.  You will not want to put it down.  There were reports that this book revealed top secret equipment and that the Seal Teams (JSOC) had not approved.  This is totally not true.  There is not one piece of equipment shown or discussed that I have not read about in one or more other books or articles that are available to the general public.<br /><br />Don't skip this book.  It is one you need to read.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I flew through this second book.  The first one was a slow start and the last one is a good \\"normal\\" ending.  All were good reads.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I live this app. have found so many useful ideas. the recipes r great and my family is loving the new treats.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This is a must read, it's amazing. A million times better than I had expected. After reading this book Gideon is my hero!
B008RV5K5E|5.0|THIS WAS 100X BETTER THEN THE AVENGERS MOVIE AND I LOVED EVERY SECOND OF IT, THE MUSIC THE ART THE VOICE. ALMOST BETTER THEN THE DARK KNIGHT RISES. WATCHING THIS ON MY KINDLE FIRE HD WAS EPIC. EPIC PICTURE EPIC DD SOUND I GIVE IT 5 ***** MAKE MINE \\"DC\\"
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I only paid $.99 for this game but I would have paid more. I am looking forward to the next one. I even got a little spooked at time while playing.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|I have to give this book 3 stars because it was well written. The characters were believable and the emotions were well expressed.  I found myself caught up in the frustrations and tensions as I'm sure was Ms.Day's intention. That said, I have to admit that the last few chapters and especially Eva's reaction in the last chapter, left me with no desire to know anything more about Eva or Gideon. In fact, I was quite surprised to see that there would be another book in the series.<br />**SPOILER**  Yes, Nathan was the scum of the earth and obviously had plans to hurt Eva again, but premeditated murder is Not okay. The series took great pains to express how children of abuse are effected throughout their lives and how it could twist who they became as adults. I guess the reader is supposed to forget that Nathan was also a child when he started abusing Eva. He was just 2 years older than Eva, so when he first raped her when she was 10, he was only 12. Not that this in any way excuses his behavior, but what caused him to be that way?<br />  If the intention was to leave the reader disturbed beyond belief, task accomplished! It's disturbing enough that the police reaction was,\\"I threw away my notes.\\" It is beyond disturbing that Eva should see a calculated murder as a \\"gift.\\"<br />  My overall reaction at the end of the book was, \\"I'm done.\\"
B008673ZAQ|5.0|When I opened my Kindle and saw this downloaded I was so excited.  I immediately dropped everthing I was doing and settled in for a read.  I was completely engrossed from the beginning. I know a book is good when I can't put it down, don't talk to my family and don't sleep till it's done.  This was just as good as the first.  Eva and Gideon have a connection that is electric.  I am already antsy for the third one.  Way to go Ms Day.  I will be reading this one over and over again until the next one.
B0042JH0EE|5.0|I saw the show last night and it was fabulous. I am going to buy the DVD. I loved the renditions by Phil. He captured the sounds well and did not try to imitate the Black sound but gave us his own.
B0002Z1EG2|4.0|I bought the album because I've enjoyed some of Shania's singles.  The<br />songs are good but I wish she would stick to country instead of the overdone<br />pop emphasis that hides her great voice of some of these songs.  If you<br />enjoy her music don't let my review deter you from buying her Greatest<br />Hits album.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I love playing this game. I get started and can not stop. feels real. will keep playing. no issues as ofter.
B000FC1HQY|2.0|Found this book very disappointing.  Found the book boring and difficult to get through. I was expecting an exciting book about growing up in Africa, unfortuntately found an almost-documentary, very un-exciting and didn't manage to finish the book.  I am surprised that it had such a high price on it.
0061906220|5.0|I was also extremely disappointed to read the School Library Journal's review of Pete the Cat: I Love My White Shoes.<br /><br />This book is a groovy journey through colors. It teaches children that sometimes things happen, and should you cry? Goodness, no! You make the best of a situation and you keep on going. It teaches children that they have control over their own attitude towards events that might happen in their life. It teaches them to stay positive and upbeat. The illustrations are wonderful and compliment the story perfectly!<br /><br />We (my grandkids and I) enjoy reading about Pete the Cat and his Groovy Attitude ... and we will keep walking along and singing Pete's songs ... because ... it's all good!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I listened to the audiobook of Defending Jacob -- as a prosecutor and new legal thriller writer myself.  And yep, William Landay nailed it!  The novel brought awareness of important issues like bullying, cyber-bullying, and personality disorders like anti-social disorder and psycopathy.<br /><br />If I had to pick on something, which I don't want to because I enjoyed it overall, I'd say the dialogue could be improved.  Laurie Barber's dialogue became nagging at times, but it all made sense to me once everything was tied up at the end.  The kids' dialogue - Jacob and his friend Derrick - started out a bit awkward but by the end of the novel, the teenage voices became more realistic - through the trial phase.<br /><br />The twists and turns at the end surprised me and I was excited by them, but they felt a bit rushed to me - maybe because I didn't want it to end - compared to the rest of the story, which progressed at a good pace.  I was left wanting to learn more about the characters in the end and how Andy Barber came to know the specifics about the tragedy at the conclusion.  But maybe that will come out in the next novel.<br /><br />I read that Mr. Landay is a big outliner and I could tell by the organization of his novel.  He nailed it there too!  He was able to jump between grand jury transcript to real time to courtroom trial.  It all worked very well.  I can't wait to read his next novel!
B00692ASTQ|5.0|Mylo Xyloto (Special Edition) is probably the best music item to buy nowadays.<br /><br />Everything inside this box is amazing and very creative!<br /><br />If you like Coldplay you MUST buy this one!
B007UXSPK2|1.0|Not providing review for movie.  Service disrupted continually over 24 hours.  I could not even finish the movie in time.  I like Amazon.  I have a Logitech Revue, and Comcast high speed cable.  There are so many things that can go wrong with downloads, links in the chain, but I don't have this bad a problem with any other services.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|The movie is within the same universe as Ridley Scotts Alien however 30 years prior and on a separate planet. The story is nearly all original in a different direction with Easter eggs of what will someday lead to elements in Alien such as the Weyland company and the Space Jockey(s). This film does not bring us to the beginning of that film, the elements exist but the story moves in another direction. There are enough pieces to answer some questions in Alien but open ideas to new questions for this science fiction thriller. Questions posed by the lead character have hints of answers but most are not revealed. As any good science fiction story would it asks you to think instead of leading you to obvious ends. The planned sequel may provide Ridley Scotts answers but we have a few years to guess where this adventure might end. Plenty of clues in Christian ethos are planted within the films dialog and on the screen at important parts in the film. Pay attention even to dates in question.
B008XG1X18|3.0|the app crashes all the time on my kindle it is so frustrating and it freezes my kindle sometimes. I thought I had too many apps so I reset my kindle and it still freezes :(
B004UID2LC|5.0|this app sucks the new update doesnt let you watch a lot of videos that you used to be able to watch
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I used the free version of this app for over a year. Then I heard that you could set TuneIn as your alarm on the paid version so I downloaded it. I've had it for a month and just now figured out how to use the alarm feature. I would have given it 3 stars, but now it does exactly what I bought it for. I do wish it was a little easier to use, but I still love it.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|an easy mind numbing game.  You don't have to think very hard to enjoy it.  I found myself addicted to it.  it is great and every one can play no matter how old you are or you mental capabilities.
0307352145|5.0|This book explores the nature and value of introverts, and is an eye opener.  Introverts make up 1/3 to 1/2 of the world's population, but are unappreciated in most societies.  Especially in the United States, introverts are viewed with suspicion, pity, or disdain.  The American culture has become one of extreme extrovertism with gregariousness, sociability, and aggressiveness valued above reflection, contemplation, and seriousness.  However, the vast majority of significant advances in technology, medicine, and even business, have been created and developed by introverts.  This book points out the value that introverts bring to all aspects of life, and cautions against placing too much importance on extroverts, which can lead to disastrous consequences for all (e.g., the financial crash of 2008).
B002KSPKRS|5.0|People have been hating on these...and i've been very skeptical about wirelesssss ANYTHING really for quite a while....but these have really changed my mind. They are wireless and use 2 AAA batteries but man are these worth it!!! The sound that came from first turning on my xbox while wearing these put a huge grin from ear to ear across my face...creepy i know...but WOW! i couldn't believe the depth of sound quality in these things!!! you can use them for music too which is a huge plus...i bought them refurbished for $80 bucks and needless to say...half a year later i am in love with them...don't tell my gf though...
B0083SBMBM|5.0|This was one of my Favorite Movies This Year when it came to theaters in may I had to wait till my college final were up before watching but in the end it was worth the wait.[[ASIN:B008NCSZQ8 Marvel's The Avengers]] and so was waiting on the dvd to come out.
0525953728|5.0|The book is a very well written one. It escalates from the beginning. And just like the SEAL way of life, hang on. It takes you from one war front to another with flow. Easy read and enjoyable. 5 stars.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|A slightly different type of reading material for me but read all 3 books in a very short amount of time.
B00957T6X6|1.0|Just as the others, I came to buy the 4 books bundle, then I saw with happines that amazon already have the 5 books bundle, but the happinness disappeared as soon as I realized the price.  For that price I will buy the printed version elsewhere.  =(
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I had seen and enjoyed the movie, and hoped that the book would provide some additional background and details. I started reading it, and found that it was identical to the movie. I decided that I did not want to finish reading it. If you have not seen the movie, you would probably enjoy this book.
B0051UP5NQ|3.0|Great Office product. The UI is pretty good, nice features, but skimping on spell check to sell dictionaries is shameful. Having to shell out more money to buy a dictionary for spell check, while not integrating free dictionaries (like ColorDict) is a cheap cash grab, and the inconvenience of needing to use other office services to spell check (quick office includes it, but the UI isn't as good) is a burden. 3 stars for an otherwise stellar app
B005LAJ212|5.0|This is a great drama soap. Proud to own the DVD. Arrived in good cond. and great shape. And shipped as soon as it was available.Thank you.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This book needs no introduction. If you stop being critical, you might find yourself enjoying this breezy read. Definitely aimed at the teen market, it's not life changing but is fun and entertaining. You could do a lot worse.
0316228532|3.0|the positive:  it was well written and the characters were well developed.<br /><br />the negative: the storyline was extremely dull. I kept waiting for something to happen and nothing did. it was just a bunch of petty selfish people living their petty selfish lives. (I guess that was the point- to show how self centered humanity is)<br /><br />I also could not get past how crude it was. Every third word was a curse, every other chapter a sexual scene or reference. I know it was an adult book but the constant drug use, self mutilation, rape, spousal abuse, child neglect, molestation etc.. was really not my thing.
B002M5E2DW|5.0|As I read through the book, I began thinking of my own life. I remembered a time when I told a girl I was dating during a conversation that I seem to always get what I want. She thought I was being pompous and wouldn't date me anymore. You would have had to have been there, but it just seemed to fit into the normal flow of conversation. I was just making an observation, but as quickly as I made it, I forgot about it. But this book reminded me. I haven't experienced great monetary wealth in my life, but I do seem to have received just about everything I ever wanted. And thinking about monetary wealth, I have often thought to myself that I probably wasn't meant to be rich. That I would have to work hard for my money. You can bet that I have now changed that way of thinking, though it was difficult after so long believing it to be true.<br /><br />This book reminded me of many other quotes I have read over the years. I have never been able to remember the people making the quotes, but I remember the quotes. One that has always stuck with me is, \\"If you can conceive and believe it, you can achieve it.\\" This book reinforces that statement. And it is true. I know others will just dismiss the book and what it's teaching. But really, what have you got to lose? Nothing. And everything to gain. I have never been into formal religions. But I have always felt there was something more. \\"The Force\\" if you will. But even though I don't follow a particular religion, most of them do teach peace and love. So really, what's wrong with that?<br /><br />I am happy and grateful to have come across this book. It reinforced my own optimistic view of life and gave me a few things to shoot for. I am still waiting for the rock I said was mine early in the book. But I know I will see it since it is already mine.
B008RV5K5E|4.0|One of the greatest BATMAN stories ever gets a very well done adaptation from WB animation. Featuring a superb selection of voice talent including Peter Weller (Robocop) and Michael Emerson (LOST) as The Joker. Can't wait for Pt.2 to see much more of Emerson's performance. If you have never had the pleasure of reading Frank Miller's DARK KNIGHT RETURNS...this is a great introduction.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|this was not the worst book i ever re<br />ad.  oh wait. yes yes it was the worst. absolutely unbelievable in the most real sense. sorry but has this author ever read any revolitionary war history. listen carefully do not waste your money here<br /> tjis is pure claptrap. this is my first ever review<br /> just had to warn the literate. was a book club choice. could not finish it
B008K6HN8I|5.0|This is a free app and it is easy to use. It helps with downloads from other sites besides Amazon. With ES downloaded you don't have to do anything else after you down the book that you want. Just open ES and then answer the question.
B008FSCNTK|4.0|My initial reaction to this recording was, \\"What the hell?!?\\" But after listening to it four or five times, it's grown on me. It's still my least favorite Krall recording, but I now like it. I don't think she will repeat this style. My guess is she will return to singing standards.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is actually pretty fun! You connect the same colored dots, but there is a certain way to do it in order to get it perfect.<br />The challenge lies in getting it \\"perfect\\", but that's what makes it so addicting.<br />There are many levels to complete and it does get harder as the space gets bigger. But, it's doable.<br />It's kind of involves strategy...
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|five star lots of fun great app thank you to the created of this great game upgrades are cool fun
B006HTUZ1C|5.0|Just like the title of this game, it's pretty awesome. It's a puzzle game involving very simple addition math. It takes the concept of game/fun & education into one app.  It's very much like Tetris except 2 numbered blocks are falling down.  2 blocks have to add up to the AweSum number (goal) to break it.  There are obstacles such as a bomb that randomly freezes blocks or helpers that help you get rid of one row/column/certain number/certain colored block.  Your goal is to try to keep the blocks as low as possible just like Tetris. It's thrilling and addicting.  It does keep track of your top 10 scores, so it makes you coming back to improve yourself.
B008XG1X18|5.0|love this app! I love the site and all of the wonderful ideas, recipes, and activities on it! the app is very quick, have it on my phone and kindle! just as good as being on the computer on the website!!!
B006CHML4I|5.0|I am pleased to report that my experience wearing this watch daily over the past 7 weeks has been positive. For the pricetag, I feel this is an excellent value. I have worn this watch daily and have had no complaints regarding its style, durability, or accuracy. The calendar is easy to set up, and the minimalist design works with a wide range of casual clothing.<br /><br />My particular watch gains approximately 6 minutes per month: about 90 seconds per week. I consider this \\"acceptable\\" and much better than a watch that runs slow. Like all nylon products, the band does hold an odor, presumably from micro-organisms in the fibers. I will eventually replace it with a leather band. I am looking forward to many good years with this timepiece.

B007TMON8M|5.0|I missed the \\"Free App of the Day\\" when this was available, but a friend got it then and when I saw it, I just decided it was worth the purchase price...and I think it was...pretty cool game!
0465043577|2.0|I knew this would be a complicated read when I bought the book. I have to say that the book leaves you with a rather empty feeling. Mandlebrot's discovery of fractals is one of the major advances in 20th century thought. It is understandable that his ego is as large as his discovery. I don't have a problem with that. If you are interested in fractals in general, or in Mandelbrot personally, you might consider the book a hit. But this is not supposed to be a book about fractals in general or Mandelbrot. It is supposed to be a book about the fractal nature of markets. Sadly this is where the book falls short. My guess is that less than half the book is actually about markets and the gist of the commentary is that markets are more volatile than we expect them to be. 100 pages to explain that markets don't fit standard deviation or bell curves. Hey, I already expected markets to be volatile. Taleb's, The Black Swan or Gunthers, The Swiss Axioms would be much more valuable for those interested in markets. This book is a hit for fractals but a miss for markets. That's why I rated it two stars.

B0012DH51Q|4.0|This is a Digiview bootleg of the original Arrow Entertainment release, the special is wonderful but, typical Digiview, they plaster their name all over the DVD, I love the cover art but they misspelled Max Schreck's name. I wonder if this fell out of copyright because all Digiview product is public domain. I know the original 1922 film is public domain, but is this specific version PD? I don't know, I have every version of this out there (1998 VHS, 2001 DVD, 2006 DVD and now this one). At least Digiview is defunct so they can't rip off anyone else. I know this must be in a legal tangle because of the Type O Negative soundtrack and royalties had to be paid to them, maybe that is the reason Digiview is defunct. Oh well, must be off. Thanks for reading the review.

1416594795|4.0|Unfortunately Richard Dawkins preceded this book with the book, [[ASIN:0618918248 The God Delusion]]. He realized that the earlier book angered even some of his supporters and hardened hearts against him more than it helped to bridge the gap between the religious and adherents to science.<br /><br />This book comes from his passion for evolution and his determination to answer those with questions about the \\"theory\\" of Evolution, and more particularly the fake theory of Intelligent Design.  The failure of Intelligent Design is a matter of proven fact. Decided in a Dover Delaware case, before a conservative judge who saw, first hand how creationist texts were re written by cut and paste to be born again as the theory of Intelligent Design.  Sic Transit Intelligent Design.<br /><br />It is unlikely that the true believers will read this book. At that level it is a failure in concept for Dawkins. For those who do read it, it is a valuable resource against those who think they have the facts to defeat evolution. The facts as Dawkins consistently documents, support the fact of evolution.<br /><br />To be technically correct; there is The Fact of Evolution and the Theory of Evolution.<br /><br />The fact of evolution can be established following the simple logic of Darwin's original arguments:<br />1. All life forms reproduce at a rate greater than needed to duplicate the parent/s (cell division as well as sexual reproduction).<br />2. Absent some limits on the number of off spring who survive, that life form will exceed the space and resources on the planet.<br />3. Competition for limited resources means that those individuals who are less able to compete will die either without offspring or with relatively few.<br />4 Those individuals who survive will have or have more offspring and therefore their individual qualities will be more likely to carry forward into future generations.<br /><br />As we extend this logic sequence forward, we can expect to see variations in any given life form and that life forms will over time vary from the original. All of this takes huge amounts of time.<br /><br />At this level Evolution has been tested more than any known theory and passes these tests. Evolution is predictive and in fact all of us have come into contact with it in any of several forms. Example animal breeds, the need for this year's flu vaccine to fight this year's flue and DNA evidence.<br /><br />Change in life forms over time is a fact. That the Earth has been around for millions of years is a separately established fact and is not herein discussed any further.<br /><br />Some of the more negative reviews of this book have been based on specific questions in the Theory of Evolution. That is what exactly are the mechanics of, the speed of and the sizes of changes allowed given the amount of information we know about topics like genetics. This debate is not possible unless you accept that life forms change over time.<br /><br />By analogy there is the Fact of gravity and the theory of gravity. There is the fact of light and the theory of light. Across the world of physics there are major disagreements over what is a wave and what is a particle?<br /><br />We all demand that our cars and aircraft be build to the highest standards of science. Airplanes fly because of the facts of physics, not the debates within the field of physics.<br /><br />Enough about evolution. What about the book?<br /><br />In 12 chapters Dawkins lays out virtually every question and argument that is supposed to disprove the fact of evolution. In clear, lucid and frequently passionate prose he lays out concrete examples and the attendant logic to support the case for the fact of evolution.<br />This is not a book seeking to balance arguments. Dawkins holds to his evidence and gives no standing to those who fail to understand.<br /><br />Dawkins is clearly passionate about the beauty of a science driven world. His wonderment at the eloquence of creation is forefront. That the world should have laws and that these laws are decipherable is motivational to Dawkins. He wants you to see that science does not reduce the wonder of existence; it proves the wonder of existence.<br /><br />For myself I suggest the following.<br />The word/concept/definition/ of God is a matter of belief. Belief is what you have that that requires no proof.<br />Whatever our role as humans may be, we are confronted by challenges and questions.<br />Our efforts in the form of work, learning and thinking, can bring us to whatever limits there may be on human ability to answer all these challenges/questions. Whatever we cannot know, and by this I mean beyond human abilities now and in the future is the boundary between human existence and Devine existence. Failure to strive towards that boundary is a failure to meet divinely proposed challenges.<br /><br />There is no reason to assume that science is a refutation of religion. Science is a human tool for understanding life in this world and to answer the challenges of living in it.<br /><br />I would like to think that everyone who would question the fact of evolution will read this book. Likely most will not. It is therefore an easy to read enlightening casebook resource for those who are either unsure or who need facts to face down those who would limit human achievementrefront.

B008EZVNO0|5.0|Van Morrison has been producing stellar music for over 4 decades now. On this , his 35th studio recording , Van again proves why we eagerly anticipate each new release , and why they are so relevant.<br />On this disc Van is with the band. Who else would release a disc in 2012 that has stand-up bass , trombone and trumpet solos that all work cohesively together loke a fine oiled machine.<br />The notes indicate that this was all recording \\"live in the studio\\" , and if so , it makes it all that much more amazing.<br />Van's writing and singing are in top form , and the band rocks (or should I say swings !)<br />If most any artist had at least one of this level of quality album  in their canon , it would be a blessing. Van has had over 25 such records and is truly one of our greatest treasures.

B0034DGPEU|5.0|Great book!  I learned so much about the culture & class system of the times.  It was interesting to compare the class system to the servant class on Downton Abbey, and to see the class restrictions imposed even on women of wealth.  Everyone had a \\"place\\" & woe to anyone who challenged that thinking.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|I've read the whole series, and felt like I'd already read this one when I started it.

I dunno, they are all starting to blend.....

B007TBZ63Y|4.0|Okay, so I shall now be suffering from great-book-aftermath for a few days. Overall, I am not loving the Heroes of Olympus series as much as the original PJO. I don't know if its because I'm getting older or what, but this I'm not feeling it. Now don't get me wrong, I enjoyed this book. I liked the POV's, and it was hillarious. But... It did not feel terribly balanced. It was very fast-paced, and almost felt like a little TOO much action. I defintely reccomend this book, but I sure hope the next one is better.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I just love the way Sylvia Day writes.  She has a way with words that make you feel everything that you are reading. I loved this story from the beginning.<br /><br />I know that may seem strange but I like that both h/h are damanged. They can both related to each other and feel each others pain. Gideon is so twisted up with his pain. Eva seems to be the only one that understands him or wants to understand him. In this book you will find out where some of Gideons pain and dreams come from. Gideon is so strong, yet so fragile. Eva has her own issues, but she owns up to them. Even with all of her issues and insecurity Gideon is right with her. Even when she feels that he is a million miles away he is always still there.<br /><br />I stalked this book...After I read Bared to you and had the hardest time waiting for Reflected in you. Now I will have to do it again.<br /><br />For the people that say this is just like 50 Shades....you are so wrong. This book series is 10 times better than 50. I know I read the books. By the time is was half way through the 2nd book I wanted it to be over. I completed the series but I dont think that i will ever go back and read it again. This series is a re-read. In fact I re-read Bared to you right before this book came out just to make sure that I didn't miss anything. I am sure that I will be doing the same again getting ready for the third book of this series.<br /><br />If you havent read any of Days other books, you should give them a try. I normally dont read English/Historical romance but Days rocks.

1401310672|5.0|Never would I thought that \\"Damn You, Autocorrect\\" by Jillian Madison (based on the website) would be so amazingly hilarious!  I was downstairs with a friend, looking at books in our apartment complex's book sharing library, and thought I'd open the book and see if some of the autocorrections in texts were funny.<br /><br />They weren't.  They were RIDICULOUSLY HILARIOUS!  Like laughing so hard I was literally crying.<br /><br />For instance (from the back cover):<br /><br />Person 1: Don't worry, seriously. He's crazy about you and he loves you so much.  He told me the other day that you're the first girl he had ever thought about the fuhrer with. Xx<br />Person 2: WTF?<br />Person 1: Ok so that was supposed to say future... Damn phone! Xx<br />And (from page 62). . .<br /><br />Person 1: Sext me. Right now.<br />Person 2: Ohhhh baguette<br />Person 2: hahahahahaha<br />Person 2: Babyyyy*<br />But what is autocorrect?  For those of you who live under a rock, autocorrect is a software function that tries to correct words that are usually misspelled, and this mainly happens thought texting.<br /><br />Most of the time, it works amazingly.<br /><br />However, this book shows the consequences that autocorrect can have on conversations.<br /><br />Now, I totally wouldn't normally count something like this on my 100 Books in a Year list, but it's 277 pages of hilariousness that I COULD NOT PUT DOWN!  It even interrupted my reading of \\"Age of Miracles\\" that I had been dying to read and waited weeks for from the library.<br /><br />Also, I'm listing this book as nonfiction. . . which is kind of funny, but isn't it a real book about real autocorrect events????<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone who likes a humorous book!  It's a quick read and so worthwhile!  \\"Damn You, Autocorrect\\" is probably the funniest book I have ever read!<br /><br />It also makes me wish I had more of an autocorrect story than changing \\"so\\" to \\"do.\\"  That's not a very funny one.  But there are many funny ones in the book!<br /><br />Share here your personal Damn You, Autocorrect moment!<br /><br />Thanks for reading,<br /><br />Rebecca @ Love At First Bookre many funny ones in the book!<br /><br />Share here your personal Damn You, Autocorrect moment!<br /><br />Thanks for reading,<br /><br />Rebecca @ Love At First Book

Being a veteran myself, I know this first hand.[[ASIN:0525953728 No Easy Day: The Firsthand Account of the Mission That Killed Osama Bin Laden]]
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I was entertained by the story and had difficulty putting the book down. I will be buying the other books in the series
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Wow! I can honestly say that I don't know where the story goes from here...which is refreshing. It's nice to see issues that are dealt with in a relationship presented here. By that, I don't refer to the extreme abuse that the characters have been through, but the insecurities that all of us are plagued with in a relationship and really, no matter what anyone has been through, that trust fall we all must take if you want to be with someone. I am excited to see where this story will go because there are so many different paths it can take. Nicely done, and please if you can release Entwined With You, sooner, rather than later, please do so.
B001AD3NIM|5.0|Each note and lyric of this album shines thru with outstanding clarity of heart and spirit!  The songs included here show a true growth of character, a reserved humbleness befitting of a goddess, and serve as testimony of her lessons and trials.  This collection not only pays homage to the hardships she has endured so far in her life, but also reminds us all that success and progress start from the inside and work themselves out.  Alanis inspires us with her candid sense of place and purpose as never before.  This album does a wonderful job at proving its roots within a secure, wise, and grounded woman.  I can't wait to hear more just like this.  Especially worth looking into are the heart-hitting songs including, \\"Incomplete,\\" \\"Orchid,\\" and \\"Underneath.\\"  Also noteworthy are the tracks, \\"Not As We,\\" \\"In Praise of the Vulnerable Man,\\" \\"Straitjacket,\\" and \\"Madness.\\"  That's 7 out of 16 already honorably mentioned...the Deluxe Edition is a must-have!  Get some!
0525953728|5.0|Very well written....keeps you on the edge of your seat.  It is a must read for all who are interested in what the men and women who serve our country do for us on a daily basis.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|Really this film gets a bad rap because people were wanting a full on precursor to Alien. It is much more than that and for that a better film. The imagery and methodology in Prometheus are some on the best put on screen. Every scene in the film has a hidden meaning and if you really understand the symbolism this film will be one of the best science fiction films you have ever seen. Most of the answers are there and the rest will be answered in the sequel.
B001NCQSDM|5.0|And just like that album, combining studio tracks alongside live tracks.  Like Rave Up, not a bad song among them, though only 6 songs.  Badge was the 'big single' featuring the guitar work of one George Harrison, who also shared the writing credits.  It was a pay back for Eric appearing on the White album.  The studio tracks have a 'pop' feel, which was a departure from the gloomy, dark studio work that they were known for.  Goodbye was balanced by the joyous blues of the live tracks.  This was just a well balanced album, musically.  AND it came with a black light poster of the front cover!  (I think because it's been years....decades....since I've see it.)  Cream's discography consisted of the busker ish Fresh Cream, the psychedelic Disraeli Gears, the studio/live Wheels of Fire and the just fun Goodbye Cream.  Later, Polydor would release 2 more live albums, a best of, a boxed set that includes everything, the BBC sessions and the reunion at Madison Square Garden album.  This was one of the nice ones at the time, and beyond time.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This was my favorite out of the three books (freed). If anything can be changed in this entire trilogy, it would be the sex scenes. It was kind of overdone. I understand that when you are in a new relationship and when everything is all new to you, you can't wait and want it all the time. That I get. But it could have been written a little differently. Like get to the point that they went into the red room again or in the room period, and skip the details. After the first 20 times we all kind of get what they do in bed.<br />I read the entire trilogy and I am still giving it 5 stars because I think it's a great story and I loved all the characters. I wish there were more to Mr. Grey's side of the story. I loved his thoughts on Ana. I would love to hear his side about the whole relationship with Ana. And to know what was said and done with his ex's and Ms Robinson. That would've been interesting.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I have been waiting forever for this book to come out and yes it was well worth the wait. Gideon and Eva have their challenges and what couple doesnt? I am glad to say that their relationship maybe like many others out there with their trust issues, it is how a couple overcomes them that defines their relationship and I can tell you now that I think the first book was her side of how messed up she was the second book is how messed up he is the third book is going to be them working it out and together through it all. This book I rated 5 stars, simply because I couldn't/wouldn't put it down. I love this book/series and recommend it to anyone that loves to see a romance play out in almost everyday events. A quick FYI Eva is going to get on your nerves and you are going to want to slap her upside the head. Thanks Sylvia Day for another must have.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|Mumford and Sons has yet again created a purely magical album.<br /><br />First of all, Mumford is able to create such peppy and up beat music for everyone to listen to. They aren't exclusive when it comes to their musical style. The instrumentals are so intricate and well put together! Mumford has once again developed a unique album full of catchy tunes.<br /><br />After identifying the peppy layer of the songs, it becomes evident how deep and well thought out the lyrics are. \\"Sigh No More\\"'s lyrics were so rich and \\"Babel\\" does the exact same. \\"I Will Wait\\" for example has so much to offer. The passion of the band members shines through in Marcus's vocals and through the instrumentals. The lyrics show this passion as well. Everyone can easily relate to the lyrics. Mumford is able to make each song easy to relate to without it being shallow and general. Each song strips you down to your core. The songs are pure and true which is hard to find in the music industry right now. Mumford is a lyrical genius!<br /><br />I highly recommend this album to everyone! It's catchy yet passionate, peppy yet deep, and exciting yet powerful!
B0058YPGSY|5.0|Bad to the Bone!!! Can't wait for season 5 to get started. The whole story line is coming to a boil.Must see if your a SONS Fan.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It's helpful to have a calculator on my fire. I use it often and it is a simple and easy to use tool. It is FREE, so nothing beats free. It has nice large buttons and a nice screensize.
B004PHSTY8|5.0|Okay, here's a few more words on the subject of 'Supernatural'. It's a great series. No series over these many years has captivated and bewitched me as much as this amazing tale of two brothers. Sam and Dean Winchester have gone to Hell and back (literally) for one another. Plus, they saved the world a time or two in the process. What a ride.<br /><br />This purchase (The Complete Second Season [Blu-Ray]) has officially completed my collection of released seasons. This one was a long time coming. I'm happy it's finally here.
B006HTUZ1C|3.0|I did like this game, but my daughter didn't like it. She's eight and very smart. I think the pieces fell down too fast for her. Maybe it would be better if there were options for speed. I played it and I thought it was a good app and would help children with their math skills. I'm only giving it three stars because I couldn't get my children to like it as much.
B005GY0Y8S|2.0|It isn't that there is anything obviously wrong with this book (other than the usual need for better copy editing), but it definitely didn't work for me. Too much head hopping for one thing. Very slow at times. Small things that felt out of character. The ending didn't settle well either, although I am challenged to explain why. Also I think the cops were presented as rather too incompetent to be believable. Finally, I found the title totally inappropriate for the contents.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|I was expecting something else. This wasn't like any game I played at a fair. It was OK, but it got repetitive.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I absolutely loved Bared to You - in fact it was one of my favourite books of the year - so I couldn't wait to spend more time with Gideon and Eva in Reflected in You. I've had the paperback on order for months but when the release date was pushed back I couldn't wait and had to buy the Kindle version too. As soon as I got home yesterday I started reading and I literally devoured this book, Sylvia Day did it again and kept me up until 5am reading for the second time! I'm going to assume that anyone reading this review has already read Bared to You so this may contain slight spoilers for the first book - if you haven't started the series yet then you really need to!<br /><br />This series isn't one you're going to enjoy if you don't like angst and drama in your relationships but for anyone who loves emotional upheaval and characters who are deeply flawed and psychologically damaged by their pasts then you're going to love Gideon and Eva. They both have serious hang ups about themselves and trust issues with each other and that doesn't make for smooth sailing in any relationship but it does make for gritty and realistic reading. The attraction between them is intense but it is about more than physical lust - they just both have difficulties explaining their feelings. Because they find it so hard to communicate they often use sex as a way of expressing themselves which can sometimes cause more problems than it resolves.<br /><br />What I love most about them is that they both know they are messed up, they both admit to having issues and they are both determined to make a success of things. They understand that they are both going to have to compromise if they want to be together and they are both open to accepting the help of a couples counsellor to make things work. Because the story is told by Eva we get to see exactly what goes on inside her head, how her jealousy effects her and why she does the destructive things she sometimes does which allows us to relate to her and see her side of things. We know a lot less about Gideon's emotions and until quite near the end of the book we don't learn any more about his past than what Eva guesses from witnessing his nightmares. At times this makes him seem a bit closed off but although he finds it hard to express himself there are times when he manages to say exactly the right thing to make you fall for him. I'll be upfront and confess I am majorly crushing on Gideon right now, I didn't think I could like him more after Bared to You but I was proved wrong!<br /><br />Reading Reflected in You is like going on an emotional roller coaster; there is drama and angst; there are secrets and misunderstandings; there are arguments and punishment screws but then you also have the hot sweaty make up sex and some incredibly sweet moments between them! Gideon swears he isn't romantic but he really, really can be. Eva sums it up herself when she says \\"The simple fact was, Gideon and I were the best and worst things that had ever happened to each other.\\" They know how to push each others buttons in both a positive and negative way but they understand exactly what they are doing and are surprisingly insightful when it comes to their actions. This is one messed up couple who desperately deserve a happy ending and I can't wait to get my hands on Entwined in You to see if they get it!<br /><br />I'm going to leave you with a couple of my favourite quotes:<br /><br />\\"I'd rather argue with you, angel, than laugh with anyone else.\\"<br /><br />\\"People get over love. They can live without it, they can move on. Love can be lost and found again. But that won't happen for me. I won't survive you, Eva.\\"<br /><br />\\"I am obsessed with you, angel. Addicted to you. You're everything I've ever wanted or needed, everything I've dreamed of. You're everything. I live and breathe you. For you.\\"and see her side of things. We know a lot less about Gideon's emotions and until quite near the end of the book we don't learn any more about his past than what Eva guesses from witnessing his nightmares. At times this makes him seem a bit closed off but although he finds it hard to express himself there are times when he manages to say exactly the right thing to make you fall for him.

B00910Y1OQ|5.0|My computer doesn't seem to remember I bought this game, but it is on my fire. I started with the free version and I bought this one. I'm not sure why I'm not getting the verified tag. Anyway, this reminded me of a Nintendo DS game I liked a lot. I cannot remember the name of it. It was like Jewel Quest, but wasn't. It is a match 3 game. There are pieces that need to be released by matching jewels under them. It was fun and it is worth the money.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Downton Abbey Season 3 is absolutely wonderful so far: I had the priviledge of traveling in the UK recently, and was able to watch the original aired episodes on ITV-1.  This DVD releasing in January here in the U.S., is the original un-edited UK edition, but being released by PBS (and not Universal Pictures UK), this IS the U.S. Region 1 version, playable in all U.S. players.  It is being released in January in the U.S., the same month that it will be airing on PBS here in the States. It is currently airing in the UK on ITV-1, the first 3 episodes so far, and will be releasing on DVD in the UK (by Universal Pictures UK) on Nov 5th, so those of you with UK/Region 2 players may want to consider that.  For all you U.S. DVD players, this Region 1 DVD is coming Jan 29th!! The excellent cast returns for another round of drama at Downton: you'll love the new twists and turns in Season 3: You won't want to miss your chance to pick up this fanstastic Season 3, returning to Downton Abbey!!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|This group is absolutely amazing!  Their music is so inspiring and touching.  I love listening to their songs and watching their videos.  I saw Jon Schmidt play the piano 11 years ago when I was in high school and we were all in such awe because he was incredible!  Now, to see how successful he is and joined with a group of excellent musicians is awesome!  This CD is great, don't pass up the chance to own great music!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I've been seeing a lot of positive, and a lot of negative.  I LOVE these books.  I don't know what the negatives were looking for.  But this is an excellent story!  Has made me laugh and cry.  Will def be re-reading the series when I get to the end!
B004N8X6LK|5.0|Hmmm...<br /><br />How does one read or review Plath when her ghost so obviously lurks in every corner?  Plath as the proto-feminist... Plath as the tortured artist... Plath as the avatar of mental illness...  Mostly, though, Plath as the emotive symbol for the unbearable pressure of potential.<br /><br />I can't believe I went so long avoiding this book.  Maybe so many of us get turned off to her work by all the Sylvias we go to school with and come across at poetry readings through the years.  I was wrong to ignore the work this long or judge it by her fans.<br /><br />I haven't been as excited about words in a very long time.  I don't think she is much of a storyteller or novelist, in the sense that I use those words usually, but I think her language might rival Marquez or Fitzgerald at their best.<br /><br />I do not often read such clear and perfect descriptive passages and she seems an inexhaustible well of them and avoids falling into the faults of Faulkner in the rush to be \\"literary\\".<br /><br />While the theme of this book and its obvious and melancholy parallel to her own demise is hard to bear at times, she is such a masterful writer, it is, in the end, impossible to put down.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|As a long-time Edgar Rice Burroughs fan and amateur scholar, I was truly elated when word of the \\"John Carter\\" motion picture was confirmed.  I'd been waiting for the better part of 20+ years to see this film, having prepared myself by reading all eleven of the Barsoom novels and the various comic book versions up to the recent Dynamite Comics \\"interpretation.\\"  Truly, in spite of Disney's shoddy-to-poor marketing strategy \\"John Carter\\" was worth the wait.  While it didn't stick to the exact costuming of the novels and comics (wherein the women in particular wear literally next to nothing) the overall spirit of ERB's enduring creative vision was clearly evident. In fact, the film covers subtleties and nuances Burroughs missed in his original novel \\"A Princess of Mars\\" (which is understandable, given the fact that he wrote the novel in serialized form).  Additionally, it gives the Barsoomian characters another needed element Burroughs overlooked: a good, fun dose of comedy via the witty banter between Tars Tarkas (played to great effect by Willem Dafoe) and Carter Taylor Kitsch), and the playful antics of the Barsoomian \\"calot\\" named Woola.  Another strong highlight was the lovely Dejah Thoris (done to the maximum power by the equally lovely and gifted Lynn Collins); her concern for the welfare of her home planet, and the friendships she strikes up with Carter and Sola (Samantha Morton).  A vile pair of villains, the ruthless Sab Than (Dominic West) and the evil Thern (priest) Matai Shang, acted with unctuous charisma by Mark Strong bring that classic \\"good vs. evil\\" motif a fresh new look.  Not to neglect the able and noble Kantos Kan (James Purefoy) and Tardos Mors (Ciaran Hinds), who hold up the back end of Barsoom's strength.  A classic story, great visual effects, dialogue that respects ERB's true vision, and unforgettable characters make \\"John Carter\\" the true masterwork it deserves to be.  Bar none.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|The story line was good, the only problem was all the back and forth. If I didn't have the hint button I would have never finished the game.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I have never had any trouble with this app or game. I have always loved playing it. So glad they have it for my kindle. (:
B00999VI0Y|4.0|Since I upgraded to an iPhone5 with the new lightning port replacing the old 30 pin dock port, I can no longer plug my iPhone5 into my car's iPod cable for music. I eventually want to still be able to play music from my iPhone to my car with minimum modification and not cost an arm and a leg. This adapter is exactly what I wanted: it plugs directly into the car's iPod cable and never has to be dealt with again. It has no buttons and turns on when the car is on and off when the car is off. The moment I step into my car, I simply tell the car to choose the iPod as the device, connect to the adapter from my phone via bluetooth, and press play.<br /><br />Couple of shortcomings:<br />- the audio quality from bluetooth isnt as good as the direct cable connection, its on par with FM radio<br />- as mentioned by another review, the sound volume level is weaker from the adapter than from the direct cable connection, not sure if its a limitation from bluetooth, the iphone, or the adapter, but this isnt a deal breaker<br />- i would like the iPhone to automatically connect to this adapter instead of having me manually connect to it every time i get in the car, not sure if its a limitation from the adapter or from the iphone<br /><br />However, in the end, the product performs as advertised, works very simply and its a device where you plug and forget about it. I'll see how it hold up in the long run such as being exposed to the car's summer heat and all. Will update this review if device worsens.
B008J34466|5.0|I don't often review albums, this one is freakin amazing every song is great! I think this is Pink's best album! I cannot get enough
B00932A2MC|5.0|I am making an honest effort to respect movies for what they are meant to be and not expect every movie to be perfect in all areas.  The computer graphics for an action movie like this are not easy.  The water based effects are great, very well done.  It's action not the plot and it excels to be first rate.  It was entertaining and enjoyable.<br /><br />David
B001NLL8LA|5.0|I am a huge Jack Reacher fan. I've read all the books in the series except two and all of them were page turners. Excellent read!!!
B005723JSQ|3.0|This is my first time reading Sophie Kinsella, and I found this novel to be quite different from anything that I have read before.  It was fast paced, a bit frenetic and also predictable.  However, I could not put it down and read it all at once.  The younger texting set will certainly enjoy it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|i really love this app it is very useful like on homework and other things!<br />If someone got this app i would recomend it to them because it helps you
B004EPZ03Y|4.0|I absolutely LOVE this movie, so I bought the Blu Ray. The second time I went to watch my new movie, the disc broke!! I have never had a disc break on me before. The packaging holds the disc so tightly, I could not get it out! ...and then it snapped in half! What a waste of money!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Ok I know everyone compares books to Fifty Shades. Yes loved it but wow this was fantastic.  It is everything you want in a good romance story.  Don't like to give away the plot, but I cannot wait until December to read the last installment.  I will just read one and two again and then finish the last when it comes out.  Did not think the second could be better than the first, but wow it was. So much happens in this second installment.  Note to authors why do you wait so long between the books. If the stories are good I will buy all at one time.  As an avid ready hate to wait for the next story.
0345803507|1.0|I must admit that I am a bit disappointed. I buy my books brand new so they will look decent on my shelf.  This book came to me with a huge crease down the middle; it looks absolutely horrible and totally used.
B0015POEV0|5.0|My son turned me onto this series..once I started watching it I could not get enough. I bought all the previous season episodes too.
B0054LJGWS|5.0|The story is incredible, Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett are amazing and the narrative reminds me a little bit of Douglas Adams. Prepare yourself for an amazing adventure and the best jokes in the world.
B005T87QCI|1.0|it stinks it does not downloaded. I do not like it. downloaded twice time and it  it did not work.
B008LZYR0A|3.0|The song 'Winner' is a real disappointment if it's supposed to be the lead on this CD single.  Not that it's bad, but just OK.  The real highlight is 'A Certain je ne sais quoi'.  My honest opinion is that you should wait another 10 years for when 'A certain je ne sais quoi' is out on the next incarnation of B-side collection.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|this was excellent until latest update that removed sky drive access. why was this done??? This thing is worthless to me now. Gone are my files on my kindle.<br /><br />UPDATE! Ok, I changed the rating because I found out that an automatic update apparently updated the app on my Kindle to an older version. Not sure what happened yet but the developer is working with me to correct it to the latest version which does have the Sky Drive.
B007NWCZR4|5.0|The Pet shop boys always come up with such gems for their B sides; there is only 3-4 tracks here that I skip over.  I did have a few tracks of this collection already from CD singles, but most were knew to me.  The best are 'boy who couldn't keep his clothes on', 'truck driver and his mate', 'between two islands' and 'after the event'.  No Pet Shop boys fan should pass up this collection!
0316228532|5.0|I took a while to adjust to the tangled web of characters so clearly defined but yet at every step you are forced to readjust your knowledge of them.  This is a clever blend of revealing aspects of each life that initially make you question whether you are mixing up people, but then you realise that each person has a unique personae for each relationship and only in time do you start to see the blend that is the whole imperfect personality.<br />This is dark English humour, focused on the petty concerns of village life, yet revealing universal truths of human nature. This is authentic English Literature following the trials and tribulations, a coming of age, of the central character.  It is no adventure, murder mystery, but just the exposé of a community linked by friendship, hatred, and need.<br />Read it!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Amazing like the first one i cannot wait for number 3! let the countdown begin.. i read this in one day
0385536828|5.0|Were it not for some plot draginess about two thirds of the way through, I'd say this McEwan novel is right up there with his [[ASIN:1605146692 Atonement]] one of my all-time favorites. Certainly the ending is right up there with \\"Atonement's\\" And certainly McEwan's gift for creating and portraying women characters better than just about any other male novelist I've ever read is still in its prime. So if you get bogged down a bit during our heroine's vacillations and procrastinations over how and when to fess up about who she really is to lover #3, hang in there. In fact, now that I think about it, inserting some plot drag about two thirds or so of the way through might well have been intentional on McEwan's part, as the denouement to come is probably made all the better for it.<br /><br />So now that I've teased my way to the end, how about the beginning? I'll let McEwan tell you that. Opening paragraph: \\"My name is Serena Frome (rhymes with plume) and almost forty years ago I was sent on a secret mission for the British security service. I didn't return safely. Within eighteen months of joining I was sacked, having disgraced myself and ruined my lover, though he certainly had a hand in his own undoing.\\"<br /><br />Who can resist that?<br /><br />By the way, Serena's description, on first meeting him, of the man who would later become her \\"ruined lover,\\" fits McEwan himself as I remember him from past book-tour appearances. And it's a good bet other aspects of that character are McEwanesque, as well.)
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Loved Bared To You so much that I was a tad nervous/very excited to read the second book and it did not disappoint. Love Gideon and his possessive way over Eva and how he's so protective over her. The man is so hot. Can't wait for book 3 already :)
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Very pleased with this product. Most other cheap knife sharpeners I could find were part of Amazons new \\"addon\\" feature I was placed to find this. Does everything is described to do effectively.<br />Cheap, functional, works.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The Piano Guys are amazing!!! I have been a fan of Jon Schmidt for years and when they released \\" Love Story meets La Vida Loca\\" I knew something amazing was going to happen for them. I got to see them in concert just last month in Utah and it was the best concert I have ever been to! This cd combines not only some of my favorite songs they have done but some new and fantastic music. They way the can combine classic with modern day is unbelievable! Seeing them perform live was just as thrilling as listening to their music. They have a love for what they do that radiates through all of their songs. I am so glad Sony caught on and realized what true musical talent is all about! Congrats to these 5 guys for putting together a fantastic album that is sure to not disappoint anyone!!
B008I3QZKU|5.0|First, let me say this: \\"Battle Born\\" is NOT \\"Hot Fuss\\". If you want \\"Hot Fuss\\" go listen to it and stay in that cave. I'm a diehard Victim and The Killers have NEVER disappoint. My friend keeps mourning since \\"Sam's Town\\" how whatever new material they bring out \\"is not 'Hot Fuss'', meanwhile I bask in their awesomeness. Bands evolve as they grow as people and as bandmates. You can't expect Brandon to keep singing about Mr. Brightside when he now has three children and a wife (wow, been busy even with all that touring! :P) My favorite song is \\"Flesh and Bone\\"--is a great song and the lyrics are amazing. I don't care what other people complain about--\\"it's too this\\", \\"it's too that\\", \\"it's not enough of this\\", \\"it's not enough of that\\", etc. It has a great 80s vibe and I love it! There are times when my favorite bands take a new sound that I cannot honestly embrace--Muse, The 2nd Law--but with The Killers it always seems to be right. The CD has been playing in loop since I bought it the day it came out! This CD seems to be more about them, and about what they want to sing about, than about conforming with what's \\"in\\" or \\"hot\\" musically, i.e. EDM. That's something I appreciate and admire from them. So hate it or love it, \\"Battle Born\\" is here to stay and it's great!
B008XG1X18|4.0|works pretty good on my kindle fire. easy to navigate.<br />would go 5 stars if it didn't &quot;force close&quot; randomly at start up.
B0086700CM|4.0|It's pretty addicting and tons of fun. My son and I play every night. Him on his phone and me on my kindle.
B004LWZWGK|1.0|I loved this movie!!  Ultraviolet is crap though....worthless.  Such a waste that the ending to this great trilogy gets released on such a POS thing like Ultraviolet.
034580404X|5.0|I jumped on the band wagon and got my boyfriend to buy me this set. It's dirty but amazing. I loved them. I recommend buying the boxed set, especially if you're buying the paper backs to keep the covers nice and keeping them all together.
B008NAFU9A|5.0|Her Sweetest Downfall is a short story/novella of 30,000 words. This is not a novel/full-length read, but works as a companion novel to THE FOREVER GIRL, Rebecca Hamilton's bestselling paranormal fantasy debut.*<br /><br />Ophelia's been successful at hiding her true identity, until the mark of the serpent appears on her neck--a death sentence, should it be seen by anyone in her town. Hiding the mark might save her from falling victim to the witch hunts of her era, but the scorching sensation it carries can't be ignored.<br /><br />When the mysterious Ethan is sent to collect her for a life of something more, she learns concealing the mark is the least of her worries. She's destined to don a new mask--to join a dark, supernatural world and protect the future of people she may never meet.<br /><br />What she doesn't know--what she learns too late--is that her initiation won't be complete until she kills the man she loves.<br /><br />Set in an alternate Regency England, \\"Her Sweetest Downfall\\" is a standalone novella in the \\"Forever Girl\\" series, written as a gift to fans of the Forever Girl series.<br /><br />HER SWEETEST DOWNFALL will appeal to lovers of paranormal romance, fantasy, and vampire fiction.<br /><br />I have got to say I was blown away reading Her Sweetest Downfall and I sat and read the novella from start to finish as I just could not bring myself to put it down!! I loved it!! Very well written and fast paced story which completely pulled me in from start to finish. After reading this I have definately put Rebecca Hamilton right up there on my list of favourite authors and will be keeping an eye out for other works by this author. I must admit that I hadn't read The Forever Girl before I read this but straight after reading this I got The Forever Girl on my kindle and am really looking forward to reading it next.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|pretty fun game.  downloaded and still playing.  like the challenge of trying to better my score each time I play the games.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|I was hesitant to get it because some people gave it poor reviews -- it kept crashing on them or never starting up. I have had no such problems! The installation went smoothly and I have never had a lockup. This game even lets you shut down the tablet and pick up the game where you left off -- regardless of how long the tablet was shut down. IMPRESSIVE!<br /><br />I'd give it 8 stars if I could. :-)
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|I am not big on leaving reviews for movies.  But this movie is amazing!  It has action from beginning to end!  Loki is so twisted and hilarious in it.  I have read from previous reviews that this Hulk is great.  I firmly agree.  Mark Ruffalo puts on one heck of a performance as Dr. Banner.  I am not a huge Captain America fan, but I love the Captain America that Chris Evans presents.  Over all, if you are into super hero movies (or action movies) in general, The Avengers will not be a disappointment.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Loved book 2! Better than the first & can't wait for the 3rd! Still trying to put puzzle together over Gideon's past.
0525953728|4.0|This was a great book. Great story that needs to be told. Fun read, and really interesting. Don't know what all the media hype was all about.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Sweet mother, this so impressively blew away my starry-eyed expectations, I was left nursing my worn out emotions into the wee hours of dawn. The moral of the story: Trust and secretiveness are incompatible. I'm sick over poor, effed-up, misunderstood Gideon. His mysterious behavior turned my stomach into knots. I wanted Eva to strangle him with his tie, only to turn the page and find myself willing her to fall to her knees and pledge her eternal love. Like most heroines in this genre, Eva is intense, defiant, and courageous. But more than that, she's formidable in her brilliant plotting and commitment to resolution (a glorious relief from the usual lovesick uncommunicative MC who can't puzzle out her emotions without pages of drama). Eva grabs hold of every fraying component of her life and pours her heart and intellect into knitting it all back together. I felt winded in my awe as I attempted to keep up with her, even as I wondered: Can two broken people so inexplicably in love ever be made happy by it? There are just enough answers revealed to comfort the aching heart, but there is still so much left to discover in this story. The wait for the conclusion will be excruciating.
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|I gave this product as a gift to my son. After he got it home he called me to tell me how awesome it is. The feature of jamming the screw driver into the zombie's eye to open the case is just great![[ASIN:B007MS5B6Q The Walking Dead: The Complete Second Season (Limited Edition) [Blu-ray]]]
B008IJT0CE|3.0|The music is ok. However, I found it difficult to relax because the kindle does not shut down and the music played for hours.
B006LSZECO|4.0|The twists of plot kept me reading this brilliant and very scary novel.  Here is a book that makes you wonder if you really know anyone.  A couple meet, fall in love and marry, then watch each other's dark sides emerge. The wife disappears.  The police automatically focus on the husband.  How he reacts is suspicious but somehow we don't want to believe he is responsible.  Gillain Flynn gives new meaning to the phrase \\"nobody's perfect.\\"  Watching the cast of characters react to circumstances and each other makes an engrossing read.
B0094OLFUW|5.0|I really like this album, but I was a bit surprised by it (before I bought it, though, I had listened to the whole thing from NPR Music). This album has a much more ambient/laid back sound than xx, definitely with less of a beat.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|nice mindless but entertaining time waster, and at least this way your not dumping real money for tickets to win cheap prizes.  mmmm wasting money in an arcade. :)
B009EEFYZY|5.0|When this album first appeared in 1971 it's innovation was undeniable. ELP had shot light years ahead of their contemporaries with a timeless suite of violent, contemplative, challenging music that they themselves would be hard pressed to top, at least until Brain Salad Surgery came along. This was ELP for the 21st century, just like they were in the 20th. Deluxe edition or not, you could drop your needle onto the vinyl and still be astounded at the composition and musicianship on display here. You can hear the \\"bonus\\" cuts on YouTube anyway and your money would be far better spent on the new Tokyo Philharmonic arrangement of Tarkus by Takashi Yoshimatsu. Played side by side with any of Alberto Ginastera's more frenetic and forward thinking compositions such as \\"Estancia\\", his piano concertos or the Bela Bartok piano concertos, history will regard Emerson as one of the great 20th century modern classical composers. This treatment should also be given to Karn Evil 9, and c'mon Keith, where's Piano Concerto #2?<br />  ELP began as little more than punk with keyboards instead of guitars (\\"Pictures at an Exhibition\\" proves this), and along with the the classic first 7 Crimson records, pushed and defined what is lamely referred to as \\"prog\\" music today. Also containing \\"Bitch's Crystal\\" and \\"A Time and a Place\\", and wisely concluding with the barreling and driving simplicity of \\"Are You Ready Eddy?\\" as if just to say, \\"yeah, we know\\", \\"prog\\" music of this invention and caliber has yet to be matched.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Rereading before starting \\"Winter OF The World\\".Ken Follett books are always good reading and interesting. Fall of Giants is still a good read the second time around.
B007SXB498|5.0|One of Jane Austen's best novels.  It start it but you can't put it down.  I just love this book.
B008SVFX96|5.0|It is difficult to assess an album of an artist based on his life. One can and should not do it! Richie processed his life in the songs. Everyone knows how difficult Richie's life in recent years has been. Who knows where he would be today without his beloved daughter, Ava, and his Brothers Bon Jovi? I am grateful for this album, I love it and am infinitely glad that Richie is still there and this album has given us and I can see him live!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this is a real fun game. I have really enjoyed it and so would you! download it and play it.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Easily one of the best books I've ever read. Much like his other historical novels, Winter of the World is near perfection.  It's close to 1000 pages and I wish it was longer!  Bravo Mr. Follet!
B009KHDT0C|5.0|Well worth the rental. Part \\"Dallas\\" part \\"Young Frankenstein\\", all fun!! Deliberately schlocky and melodramatic (to the point of being comic): you will happily suspend disbelief.
B008XG1X18|4.0|Love Pentrest and app. it does seem to crash quite often. fix it and you get a five. But for now four stars will have to do.
B0095R64AO|1.0|This was not a comedy just a poorly written attempt at a love story gone bad.  Excellent actors just a bad storyline.
B000LJ9ZWO|5.0|This is a great movie.  The Terminator copied a lot of the ideas that were first presented in Westworld. I wish there were more movies with great plots and action like this one.  I highly recommend this movie.
1451662432|1.0|Don't waste your money on this revisionist trash.  He may be a smaller, older version of Arnold these days, but his ego is as big as ever.  No need to feel sorry for Arnold, his self pity is enough.  Instead, feel sorry for Maria and the kids, as Arnold once again embarrasses and hurts his family to the end of trying to rehabilitate the only focus of his life, his career.
B008I34YYY|5.0|7 mil euros well spent. It was worth the wait. My lungs and ribs hurt so bad from laughing. I will be getting the Blu ray.
B007N8RULO|4.0|Its a good app I guess but there way to many adds. I love spider solitaire but I think the should make the menu bar bigger or on the side
B0018QQQK8|3.0|Good book but i enjoyed the movie more,  which is rare. They do differ in most aspects but both have a lovely story line.<br /><br />Support out troops :)
B0071XO8RA|5.0|For those of you who enjoyed the story lines of Fallout, you will love this book. I only hope Hugh continues to write in the world of SciFi and horror!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|awesome game good visuals for a kindle enjoying the to do list etc.....<br />would recommend to anyone if they want to play an exciting game
B008XG1X18|4.0|I love this app!! I pinned so many things I want to try! Such a great way to share the things you love with others.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Loved this book! Tina Fey is so funny! I read this book in one day. I couldn't put it down!
B001EZ2T7W|5.0|Loved seeing Jack again, this is for all of the stargate addicts! I'm not a big fan of the new SG1leader but the movie is still a good watch
B000002MG0|5.0|The album was delivered on time. The paper record liner had scratched the surface but a deep cleaning of the album allows for these scratches to be almost dulled out. A good solid album from what was, at that time, America's best band.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|I was waiting almost one year for the second part of the trilogy. I was expecting this book to be as breathtaking as the first volume. Unfortunately, it is not. The characters, the tension, the story flow are like a shadow of the previous book. I know everything is relative. I am sure if somebody would start with this second part it would rate it higher but I need to say I am dissapointed by comparison to the first part (and the long months of \\"great expectations\\")...
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Picks up where Fall of Giants left off. Such a quick connection to the earlier families. The lead up to the war with such good insights to the political movements.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|challenging but awesome cant wait for the next one to come out. big fish games are one of my favorite. love playing.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|These guys are amazing!  The songs are beautiful and really pleasing to listen to.  The entire album (as well as other singles) are some of the best piano/cello renditions of any song. If you haven't yet, you should buy this album, and then check these guys out on Youtube.  Some of my favorite songs from them I can't find on an album or single.  I hope these guys keep getting bigger and bigger so that they will be around for a long time!  The world could use more talent like this, and a lot less auto-tune...
B007S3S8HO|2.0|My family loves Angry Birds so we sat down together and put this k'nex set together, I have a young child that did not help with the construction since the pieces are not stable on the table and little bumps and knock things over. My older son hardly had the skill or patience to put it together so my husband and I ended up taking turns putting it together.<br /><br />The fun is in breaking everything apart, but it is a major pain to get back together once things are broken. If you plan on putting it back together exactly as it is meant to be that means tracking down all the small pieces that have flown everywhere and looking at the photo/instructions to remember how to get it back together. I was involved in three rounds of put it together then break it apart before I told the kids to go outside, threw the pieces in the box, and stashed it in the hall closet hoping they forget about it.<br /><br />Definitely for older kids or just to be glued together as decor for a shelf. I would NOT recommend this for anyone to buy for their kids.
B0041T52S6|5.0|This movie is an awesome combination of Napoleon Dynamite, Dragon Ball Z, and Nintendo video games. I saw the movie first, and it was awesome. Then, i read the books, and the books were better than the movie. But anyway, the movie was great and fun. It should've been animated like the books. But who cares, Scott Pilgrim FTW!!!!!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book has a style all it's own.  At first, the different style was distracting, but it wasn't long before I caught the charm of it.  WWII Germany is not an easy subject to write on or read about but Zusak accomplishes this with much grace. It is a beautiful and compelling read.  The characters within the story are dynamic and their development throughout the story is defined in a real and tangible way.  One could feel, smell, and see them as if they existed in the real world. This has classic written all throughout it.
B000G8NXYG|5.0|Seven Samurai is to me the best samurai film I have ever seen. The first best Japanese film I have ever seen was Godzilla (1954). I saw Seven Samurai on a VHS, and it was awesome. The film was serious, the characters are realistic, and the drama is impressie.This is Akira Kurosawa's best and greatest work, and also one of his most popular films. I'm planning on to get the DVD, but I think you should check it out.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I have waited over a year and a half to continue this saga.  I am only about 25% into the book, and it is great.  Please read the first book of this triology first.  The characters continue starting in the 1930's.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This game looks easy but you will find as it gets more complicated it will make you think. Careful when you update though because I always have to start over.
B002UTNKWE|2.0|And I'm not disappointed in the recording.  I would bet that it is awesome given the cast.  What is disappointing and annoying is that I would like to rip this disc to my computer so that I could then load it onto the player of my choice.  However, Sony has put copy protection on this disc so I cannot do that.  I'm angered by this because I expect that once I make a purchase that I can do whatever I want with my purchase.  I know that they are concerned with piracy, but I will not buy another Sony Opera product ever again, which is a shame considering that they have a terrific list of backlist historic recordings.
B003N0XDT4|2.0|I go the E7 and charged it for 5 hours as the manual says.  But it would not hold a charge, every time i pulled the USB out it would turn off and would not turn on until i plugged it into a power source.  On the upside, there was a noticeable difference between my computer's DAC and the E7's DAC.  I much more preferred the E7 DAC.  Unfortunately this experience has made me consider a different company when buying my portable AMP's or DAC's with better quality control.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|I enjoy playing this game when I am at work with nothing to do. I just wish I got more coins faster while not playing
B007IXWL2C|5.0|the books were great.they took me into dream world that can happen to you if you are lucky.love it............<br />I sat on the my boat and read it all day and got a sun burn,butbit was worth it,GOOD BOOKS.Enjoy<br /><br />G.S san deigo,ca
B0086700CM|5.0|a fun race game where my children are much better then I. but a fun competition and challenge is good.
B007GCY8FS|2.0|A Wanted Man is too predictable and really just a rehash of older storylines. After 17 novels it appears that Lee Child has run out of gas.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|awesome I use on my math homework everynight!!! get every question right. helps me with negatives A LOT!!!!<br />love it a lot recommend it for everyone
B008QE9VJI|2.0|Having been a fan of Dark Shadows for the past 45 years, I can honestly say that this is undoubtedly the best version of The Addams Family I have ever seen.
B0098VXMNE|3.0|decent story line but the action shots way overused the slow motion.....kinda made the whole thing a little cheesey. The new actor couldnt lace the boots of the previous spartacus but i guess you have to take what you when an actor dies.
B0084IG8TM|3.0|Oscar better start polishing a statuette for Jennifer Lawrence...not necessarily for THE HUNGER GAMES but her time will come.  It is Ms. Lawrence's sharply etched and impassioned performance as Katness that provides the heart and soul of this film.<br />Set in a futuristic society known as Panem, the plot revolves around a basically inane contest that endorses and applauds the slaughter of young people by other young people.  Of course, several political \\"messages\\" are thrown in, with a requisite love story to appeal to the TWILIGHT/HARRY POTTER fanatics.<br />The movie's supporting cast boasts Donald Sutherland, Stanley Tucci, Wes Bentley, Lenny Kravitz and Elizabeth Banks (what's with Tucci  and Bentley's ridiculous hair styles?).  Josh Hutcherson exudes the requisite third wheel presence but Liam Hemsworth is basically wasted as Lawrence's initial love interest.  Taylor Swift's song over the closing credits is abysmal.<br />THE HUNGER GAMES is entertaining but its hype as an \\"important\\" film is exaggerated.
0446547654|4.0|The story is good, but it takes too long to get to the point! But great story overall! I recommend it to people who have a lot of extra time on there hands
B007TK77QE|2.0|I struggled through this book because of who it was written by.  If I didnt know the author and her excellent Harry Potter books, I dont think I would have made it to the end.  It started well, but there were too many characters and they were confusing in their roles they played.  There were two really good stories in this book, but because they were in the one book I didnt like either of them.  Such a shame.
0525953728|5.0|A most interesting book telling the world the rest of the story.  A dam shame the President is trying to take credit for something started long before his election
B005K17RU0|5.0|I'm not sure what the problem was for other Kindle users but this app worked great for me. It was easy to load two or three different locations and I was able to access anytime I had a wiring connection.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Seriously.  Awesome.  The whole collecting money to upgrade + playing slots at the end makes for one heckuva addicting game.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Someone wrote that Quell Reflect  was easy and relaxing.  This game is so challenging and can be quite frustrating...especially if you strive for perfect scores.  I love the &quot;go back&quot; feature:  practice makes perfect.  It's hard to put down!!!!  LOVE the levels of challenge.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Spent time looking for a bag for my Nikon D90 and stuff, and settled on this because of price and sizing info. Did not want something huge but big enough for most of my gear on a trip. This is perfect for me. Comfortable, light, and well-made. Holds D90, 18-270 lens, 85mm lens, 50mm lens, SB600 flash, battery charger, extra battery, filters, small flash diffuser, SD cards, lenspen, netbook/mouse/cord, and misc odds and ends. I can hang a light jacket on the back with the elastic straps. It can hold my tripod but I wish I had a lighter and more compact one. As others have said: the chest strap is not well positioned; a water bottle holder would be nice, as would some external connectors. I expect it to be useful for personal stuff when I decide to take less photo stuff on a trip. It can also serve as an overnight backpack without photo stuff. To match this bag I would have had to pay twice as much or more.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|an ok app for kids and adults. I has its issues but it still can be fun. I enjoyed it!!
1401232590|5.0|Gotham is being terrorized by a new serial killer who has been dubbed \\"Holiday\\" since he/she claims victims on holidays and Batman, Jim Gordon and Harvey Dent make a pact to take down Carmine \\"The Roman\\" Falcone no matter the cost, without outright breaking the law. I loved these comics. I thought they were well written and I thought the art was fantastic! Tim Sale draws one of the best, if not the best, Batman I have ever seen. He's hulking, foreboding and a little brutal, and yet dramatic, smart and thoughtful at the same time. There are some great character moments in here for all of the major players, from the Joker proclaiming that Gotham isn't big enough for two homicidal maniacs (or something to that effect) so he decides to kill every last person in Gotham until he has found and killed Holiday, to Harvey Dent and Batman hitting The Roman where it really hurts (his wallet). I read the entire series over the course of about 3 days and found it very hard to put down (I would have finished it in one sitting if I didn't usually do my reading before going to bed). The story really keeps you guessing until the reveal in the last panel of the 2nd to the last issue (and, honestly, you'll keep guessing even after that, and yeah, even some more after you finish the last issue). Highly Recommended.
B00992CF6W|5.0|amazingly. aweome you can do everything like on the real version mine survive and create and so much more i recomend this game
B007UPNA6Y|2.0|Gone are the days of the real Jack Reacher: the man men wanted to be and women wanted to be with. Gone, too, is Lee Child's ability to captivate an avid Reacher fan with thrilling plots and twists, and tight, violent but matter-of-fact action scenes. A Wanted Man lacks all the characteristics that made this series so popular, and is essentially a long drawn out car ride, ending in a pretty quiet and dull firearms battle, with a few deaths thrown in. He doesn't even attempt to get the girl!<br /><br />What happened to the Reacher who could get every female character in bed with him? The Reacher that could face off against 3 men in hand-to-hand combat and come off victorious? The Reacher that left devastation and destruction in his wake? He's certainly not in this book, and I have a feeling he won't be in many to come.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|Read only 45% ma after having waited for it with great expectations, having loved the previous, I am a bit disappointed; too mechanical and didascalic; the characters were more real in the Fall of giants and it was more spontaneous and passionate; the construction prevails on the narration
B004CFBMRY|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this book. I originally came across as I wanted to learn more about barefoot running.<br />I thought the book was going to focus on the Tamarahura tribe and while it did provide a wealth of information about these people it also dug into many other areas.<br />Evolution of humans as runners, personalities in the ultra marathoning community, information in regard to learning barefoot running and healthy living.<br />In general it was full of inspiring stories about people's achievements from all walks of life.<br /><br />Tremendous read.<br /><br />Congratulations to Christopher McDougall on a  book that is highly entertaining and a wealth of knowledge.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Gideon and Eva have such a disfunctional past, but what I love about this story is that instead of walking away from the best thing in their life they are working through it.  The rest of the world could learn from that.  Get this book.
B0019IMVDG|5.0|I think Casino is on top of the list of best contemporaty  films ever made. The combination of plot, location scenes and superb acting makes if one of the very best.<br /><br />And you ccan add my vote with the the same comments for the best western ever made  -  True Grit
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Okay, I just need to get this off my chest first and then I can get the real review done. Gideon saying to Eva, \\"You're so beautiful, it hurts to look at you.\\" was straight out of My So Called Life (Angela said that would be what she'd want to be told right before making love). I have not heard it since or read it anywhere else and it took me right out of the moment & Cross lost a couple of cool cred points with me.<br /><br />The second installment in the Crossfire Trilogy is quite more a merry-go-round than rollercoaster. I loved the first book and was extremely interested to see where the second book would take our characters. In all honesty, it wasn't that far for the majority of the book. In the first half, Eva & Gideon continued on their usual path of not using their words to resolve conflict & opting for sex as a substitute. Of course, this means that they don't resolve a whole lot. They're angry. They have sex. They quarrel. They have sex. There's another misunderstanding. What happens? They have sex. Shocking, I know. These are not two people very adept in problem solving in their personal lives. Because of this tendency, I didn't find their sexual connections, in the first half of the book to be as blistering hot. And the interlude after the concert was just sad. On both of them. I just wanted someone to phone Dr. Petersen because if ever any two people needed a session for a chat, it was these two.<br /><br />I'd been wanting to know what's going on with both of them on a deeper level since book one but unlike Eva, I'm not as easily distracted by the appearance of penis. Eva gave good lip service to what I was often thinking about a good many things from Gideon's behavior veering into completely unacceptable territory when it came to boundaries to needing to have him open up and let go of some of those secrets but mostly, she capitulated. I thought they both resorted to a juvenile sort of tit-for-tat revenge and it was more often than not over something that could easily have been resolved if one of them had the presence of mind or maturity to stop for a second, collect themselves and use their words. Instead, the grenade toss over the wall always made whatever the original thing was, exponentially worse. It seemed like their version of a love game. Sometimes I saw Eva's reasoning & other times, it just seemed convenient & contrived. Gideon was as much of a conundrum as they come & I was so frustrated waiting for answers, I skirted the edge of no longer caring what his deal was. But alas, I don't have to agree with the character's decisions to really care about what happens, so none of this was a deal breaker for me. Her jealousy was running higher in this book than the last and she seemed far less confident, especially in the first half. I missed confident Eva & I didn't want her sacrificed just to be with Gideon. Confident Eva showed up eventually and I was rooting for her again.<br /><br />I liked that Eva got a couple girlfriends this go round. She needed them. Meg & Shawna I hope weren't just props for the plot & provide actual friendship in the final book. I loved Cary as I did in the first book. He was relied upon to give Eva the benefit of his opinion & more often than not, I completely agreed with him. I was a bit put off that **SPOILER** when he wound up in the hospital it was Gideon who dispensed all of the information about him to Eva & also took care of all his post-care arrangements. I don't mind a take charge man but Eva was rendered inert and basically unable to do more for Cary than sit & cry over him. She left it all to Gideon. **SPOILER** Honestly, it made me wonder what she would have done had he not been there. Would she have been able to cope & get on or not. Cary is her BFF (most like a brother really) and Eva's not without means or mental where with all, so I expected her to bring more than the tears. I enjoyed everything with Eva's parents and wonder what the next book will bring for them. Itotally didn't have any energy to expend caring about Brett or his homage to Eva outside of how it affected Eva/Gideon. For most of the story Corrine looms too large in Eva's mind as an active adversary for me to really care. Corrine isn't a fleshed out character and is only related in negative tones. She's not meant to get to know, she's meant to propel the plot.<br /><br />I truthfully don't know how I feel about the ending. The conversation between the detective and Eva was interesting and provided a nice neat package of expository explanation but I don't know that I was sold. It wasn't that the explanations didn't make sense, they fit together nicely but... it just came together too easily and quickly in that moment, for me. Also, the detective was far more comfortable with vigilantism than I could buy into. That may not be a flaw in the storytelling but in my ability to suspend disbelief as a reader. Additionally, I thought it was in a way, giving Gideon another out to not use his words to tell Eva something of high importance. I did like that we finally got an answer as to what happened with Gideon as a child.<br /><br />Overall, I quite enjoyed this part of the story (I read it in a day). It was a lot better than many middle books in a trilogy and had a lot of tense moments & excitement to go around. I didn't think it was as sexy as the first but I didn't need it to be because what's most important to me is how Eva/Gideon manage their issues and achieve wholeness. I'm hoping for more Dr. Petersen in the final book and copious amounts of sanity because where we end in this book, is the opposite of that. I'm still very much looking forward to see where Eva/Gideon end up and am pulling for them to make it. I've already pre-ordered Entwined In You.totally didn't have any energy to expend caring about Brett or his homage to Eva outside of how it affected Eva/Gideon. For most of the story Corrine looms too large in Eva's mind as an active adversary for me to really care. Corrine isn't a fleshed out character and is only related in negative tones. She's not meant to get to know, she's meant to propel the plot.<br /><br />I truthfully don't know how I feel about the ending. The conversation between the detective and Eva was interesting and provided a nice neat package of expository explanation but I don't know that I was sold. It wasn't that the explanations didn't make sense, they fit together nicely but... it just came together too easily and quickly in that moment, for me. Also, the detective was far more comfortable with vigilantism than I could buy into. That may not be a flaw in the storytelling but in my ability to suspend disbelief as a reader. Additionally, I thought it was in a way, giving Gideon another out to not use his words to tell Eva something of high importance. I did like that we finally got an answer as to what happened with Gideon as a child.<br /><br />Overall, I quite enjoyed this part of the story (I read it in a day). It was a lot better than many middle books in a trilogy and had a lot of tense moments & excitement to go around. I didn't think it was as sexy as the first but I didn't need it to be because what's most important to me is how Eva/Gideon manage their issues and achieve wholeness. I'm hoping for more Dr. Petersen in the final book and copious amounts of sanity because where we end in this book, is the opposite of that. I'm still very much looking forward to see where Eva/Gideon end up and am pulling for them to make it. I've already pre-ordered Entwined In You.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Bought the book this morning and got so caught up in Eva and Gideon's story and couldn't stop reading. Sylvia did an amazing job with this book and cant wait until the next one. I am obsessed with these books!

B007FEFLTO|4.0|To me,  not quite as captivating as first book. Had to keep reminding myself who the characters in relation to the first book. Still an enjoyable read and look forward to third.
B0031YJFCQ|3.0|This book compared to the first two is a rather slow read - I could not put the other two down and this one does not keep me as intrigued.
1594202842|5.0|This product came to me in a timely manner by the seller. I have enjoyed the fast service, and I would recommend the book Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother to anyone because this book was so enjoyable, emotional, and controversial to the public eye.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|I purchased the LifeProof case for my iPhone 4S after hearing serveral reviews that the cases are excellent.  I recieved my case and when I put on the case I noticed I was unable to turn the phone off of silent mode, I then called another person with a LifeProof case to look at mine even on his phone the switch does not work.  I also had the issue of muffled sounding calls :( very disappointed
0525478817|5.0|I've ready all of John's books and I didn't think I'd ever love anything more than Alaska and Abundance. But this was sooooo good. I won't go on and on about his absolutely great writing style and his crafting of characters. Green's craft is so well put together and this book is his best yet. I read this book in one day. I was sad to have to finish it. Great, great, great.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Definately worth the wait!!!!we got what we waited for and so much more<br />Thank you Silvia and please dont make us wait so long for the 3rd

B0096CDG0O|5.0|My favorite! Addictive! My son is in Oregon, and I am in Nebraska. We spend a lot of time playing this game and chatting. And now with a bonus for multiple yahtzee's!!
B008LZHA3G|2.0|For anyone new to Dylan, please listen to his first album, and Blonde on Blonde, and Blood on the Tracks, and Time Out of Mind, or many others, before you buy this.  It's wonderful that he is still recording, but anyone who says it's one of his best is fooling themselves.  The songs are plodding, not lyrical, as in the best Bob Dylan.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Big Fish has been my fave for a couple of years and with this game,  they outdid themselves! It was so much fun and a great length. I will definitely buy Big Fish again. This one was also on sale, double bonus!!

B007THA4FI|2.0|I WAITED SO LONG FOR ROWLING'S NEW BOOK TO COME OUT..........I WAS SO VERY DISAPPOINTED IN IT, RIGHT FROM THE START....I'M NOT SURE I AM EVEN ABLE TO FINISH IT.  IT IS EXTREMELY BORING.  PERHAPS SHE SHOULD STAY WITH MORE BOOKS LIKE HARRY POTTER, I THINK THAT'S WHERE THE MIND SET SHOULD BE
0316066524|5.0|Read some commentary about this book before you start it and you'll be glad you did.  Very possibly written during a prolonged manic period by an obvious genius, Infinite Jest alternates between funny, confounding, and sometimes boring(the prolonged eschaton match comes to mind).  Wallace's descriptions of depression and substance addiction ring heartbreakingly true and are the best I've ever read.  If you invest the time and concentration(took me almost a month to read),you might be like me and spend the next few days reading reviews and one particularly good research paper to learn as much as you can about the author and what the heck was  going on in this book.
B006BAEQB2|5.0|Another enjoyable read be Philippa Gregory. She does such a great job painting the picture of the court and the events that unfold. The only disappointment was the book came to an end. Can't wait for her next one!
0385344333|4.0|Like many other reviewers I have read every Reacher novel.  I pre-ordered A Wanted Man on kindle, received it on Sept. 11 and had it read by Sept. 12.  Unlike many other reviewers I enjoyed this book and have no problem with Reacher refraining from kicking butt until the end.  Reacher is a great character and I enjoy his personality quirks and somewhat OCD like attention to detail.  Reacher is not only tough, he has almost savant level analytical abilities and memory which can be pretty amusing. I checked prior novels and there have always been some reviews complaining that a particular Reacher novel sucked.<br />  Reacher is an archetypal character and obviously not intended to be completely realistic, as indicated by Lee Child's somewhat disengenuous defense of Tom Cruise where he stated that Reacher's size is (supposedly) a metaphor for his relentless force and unstoppability.<br />  If all you need from a book is ACTION, I'm sure you can find suitable reading at the comic book store.

B0050DIWFC|5.0|William Landay accomplished something in this novel few other authors have, at least as far as I'm concerned - he surprised me! I spent the entire novel trying to \\"guess\\" the ending, certain one of my many imagined scenarios would be it. I failed. While the novel held my attention from start to finish with riveting characterization and courtroom drama, it was the enormous controversy and complexities on every page which truly grabbed me and sort of wrung me out, along with the age-old question we all face as humans; what would I do?<br /><br />I loved this novel. I loved the exquisite drama that Landay conveyed in professional, personal, and painful detail.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Overall and great read.  A little slow at times.  Seems to repeat some items several times. Would recommend this book toall that what to know
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved this book. There is romance, heartache, and truths are told. Gideon and Eva are a roller coaster of emotions but in the end it's worth the ride. And Cary is the best friend a girl could want to have her back at all times. The ending was shocking and something I didn't see moving and then after reading you totally believed it could happen. I finished this book in a sitting. It grabs you in the first word and doesn't let go til the ending. Can't wait to see what's on store next.
B005P68PSI|5.0|I love this show, and I loved this season. It never gets old, no matter how many times they die. New season starting soon, can't wait.
B002M9WW30|5.0|Rocky the complete pack- was just as expected- in great shape, great price, and all the movies in one pack is nice.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Destined to be a classic.  Coming of age, poignant, study of style, reference to music and other important literature, social themes, family dynamics, self-image, relationships--the novel covers it all.  It made me reflect on my high school years  and my children's.  I also projected forward to my grand children's.  This novel deserves to be discussed by people who enjoy writing and the reasons people act and think they way they do.
B005LAIHSQ|5.0|Snow White and The Huntsman was a good movie we really enjoyed watching it- since we could not seem to get to the movie theatre while it was playing.
B004QM8HV2|3.0|I'm rather surprised none of the other reviewers have commented on the fact that the role of the Prince is sung here by a tenor, while Massenet composed the role to be sung by a soprano \\"en travesti.\\" The assignment of women to perform male characters was not uncommon in the 19th century--Arsace in Rossini's \\"Semiramide,\\" Romeo in Bellini's \\"I Capuletti e i Montecchi\\" and Siebel in Gounod's \\"Faust\\" are other famous examples--and the practice even extended to ballets, where women were deemed to be more graceful. As I hope we've all learned from recordings of Baroque operas (which called for castrated male singers), transposing a vocal role by an octave seriously distorts the music, especially in duets (imagine a performance of Bellini's \\"Norma\\" with Adalgisa transposed down for a tenor!). Perhaps there are those who may prefer having a man sing a male role for the sake of realism, but we're dealing here with a fairy tale in which everyone sings their dialogue, so I don't think realism should be a consideration at this point. Unfortunately, there is no recording available with the Prince sung in the proper range. That's a pity.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Better than fifty shades. Period. I love Eva and Gideon's obsession with each other. They're realistic in a sense of the mistakes they make, the irrational decisions and love they have for each other. Both are broken. Both know they don't know what it takes to make a relationship work. I cannot wait for Entwined in you. The roller coaster I've been on since book 1 has me consumed in their love story. Oh and the sex is VERY hot too!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The series is nice an griping... I like the way the media is described as the pastor of minds in Panem..<br />Anyway the ending is weak, for a book so full of gore, if feels like she dind´t know how to end it.<br />At the end is just a blody love story.<br /><br />I´d skip all the parts were the clothes are described.. boring...<br /><br />There are some similarities with manga series battle royale; but, does it matter?..  I enjoyed reading this books, that is the porpouse of reading a fiction book.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I really enjoyed the in-depth descriptions that the movie leaves out, like how Alice was turned among others. Really good.
0385737955|4.0|I enjoyed this book and found it entertaining.  I love how things just kept happening and there were so many twists especially at the end (no slow boring parts).  It kept me in suspense and a little stressed at times (maybe too many suspenseful parts!)!  I kept wishing it would have a happy ending and that the boys would all live happily ever after.  This book also contains two chapters of the second book and it sounds just as horrific and tense but I have to find out what happens.....
B008PE9GSA|4.0|I wish Rolling Stone would make a bigger deal out of ZZ Top's return to form. This CD has been out for two weeks and deserves more than a one paragraph review. Amazon on the other hand has plenty of user reviews and they look very positive.<br /><br />Here is mine:<br /><br />Gotsta Get Paid is the best single of the year, it's a cover song of a rap tune from the 90's (kinda) but ZZ completely reworked the song into a rock tune with some serious swagger. I never knew that empty bic lighters were for transporting crack cocaine on the street. Guess Billy is more gangsta than I am.<br /><br />The Gillian Welch cover may be the best thing on the CD \\"It's Too Easy\\" with the slow burn and solo that almost drops out of the beat in a cool way. A close second is Heartache In Blue with a killer harmonica that sounds like it belongs on side 2 of Fandango. Billy gives us a great soul STAX style in \\"Over You\\" and \\"I Don't Wanna Lose Lose you\\" (with a list of characters ala Lowdown In The Street) should be the second single rather than the one weak track (Flyin High). Actually \\"Big Shiny Nine\\" would be the better single but it's about guns or sex (or maybe both...there is something dirty going on in this song for sure) and may not make the rock radio standards. Is he packin heat, grabin' his thing or his girl or all three?<br /><br />Have Mercy has some nods to previous ZZ Top songs with the \\"I Thank You\\" riff in the intro and the \\"Have Mercy Miss Percy\\" in the chorus. The best part is that they turn it into a slow burn for the outro.<br /><br />Chartreuse is a cool boogie that reminds us that Billy still likes big butts and he can not lie \\"Chocolate Mousse, don't cha know I like a big caboose\\" It morphs into Consumption that sounds like a stoned version of Chartreuse (same key but slightly slower and..um.. stonier)<br /><br />4 stars and not 5 just because Dusty does not sing a lead.<br /><br />The Best Buy version has two extra songs, one WITH Dusty on lead vocals. It's not his best song,but it's good to hear his voice. The other Best Buy only track is VERY good!best song,but it's good to hear his voice. The other Best Buy only track is VERY good!
B0017VG69U|5.0|SO GLAD I WAS ABLE TO GET THIS!!! GOT THE 3RD SEASON AS WELL!!! AND OF COURSE, AMAZON HAD IT FOR A REALLY LOW PRICE!!!! THE RE-MASTERED VERSION IS SO SO AWESOME---JUST INCREDIBLE TO WATCH!!!! IF YOU ARE A TRUE TREKKIE( LIKE ME) GET ALL 3 REMASTERED SEASONS---U WONT BE SORRY!!!! THANKS AMAZON!!!!
B0098VXE50|4.0|I actually enjoyed this version of Snow White, much like the newest version of Red Riding Hood that came out last year.  Charlize was wonderful as the evil rather demented and tormented Queen.  I loved the special effects and Chris Hemsworth was heroic as always (except in Perfect Getaway).  If you love fantasy, fairy tales and great visual and special effects, you will like this movie.  I rate it up there with The Brothers Grimm.  A little eerie, sometimes creepy, but totally entertaining.
B0084I9QIW|5.0|When I pre-ordered this, I had high expectations and let me tell ya this DVD went above and way beyond my expectations!!! This is EVERYTHING that I remember Michael Jackson to be at his prime on the Bad Tour! I was not disappointed one bit at this DVD or his performance! If you're like me and you're TRUE Michael Jackson fan, you HAVE to get this for your collection, it is very well worth the money! I can't wait for the Blu-Ray edition to be released on this performance which I hope is very soon!
B000H6SXMY|5.0|I own several box sets of my favourite shows. Some are great, others are merely a box holding a bunch of seasons together. The same seasons i could buy individually anywhere. Friends is the former. This is a unique set that you would not have by simply buying each season. It is a beautifully crafter set showing off lots of stuff from the series' run. The only mild downfall is that they are broken up into 6 sections (one for each friend) but the show ran for 10 seasons. Ergo, the set is not broken up by season, so if that's an issue for you, then you need to take that into consideration.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|this is a great cd, love every song.  a lot of fun to listen to in the car while driving.
B008XG1X18|5.0|SO super nice to have a quick easy way to view Pinterest on my Kindle Fire! Clean and easy to repin without losing your spot while browsing through your latest pins. Totally worth the wait!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|mostly very easy but fun with the occasional difficult level thrown in.  a wonderful addition to any app library.  No technical problems found thus far.
B009DP9D6A|3.0|I usually listen to Deadmau5 when I'm active, running, at the beach, or even if I want some tempo at work. For me there is a built-in expectation for his music/tempo, and that expectation is met on >atgh<.<br />Not sure if anyone else has mentioned it, but the song Sleepless is a remix of Sleeping Beauty Pills, still nice but I'll have to delete one of the versions from my player.<br />What does break my stride is The Veldt. I know a lot of people love this song, but it takes me out of whatever I'm doing. When I'm out running my mind will get lost & I'll pace along with the music, twice the Veldt came on and snapped me out of that groove and I had to fastforward to another song.<br />Ultimately this is my responsibilty as a listener & fan of Deadmau5. It's not his responsibility to specifically provide work-out music for me.<br />Good album, just a couple takeaways(which is a statistic that anyone can have about any album they like).
B00932A2MC|4.0|This was a great movie.  Some acting could have been slightly better i am sure but the graphics and plot was great.
B008VBYN80|5.0|i love this game. gameloft makes the best games. this is one of my favorite game from them. graphics are cool.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this because you choose what you like, others can see who you are inside. It's like shopping without money! I can get great ideas for cooking, my kids, my home and my upcoming wedding!
B001AQR3JY|5.0|Obviously my title says it all. I LOVE LOVE LOVE this film I bought the dvd version and although it is lacking in bonus features the clarity of the video is amazing. I love everything about it. all three of the movies are great the play is to die for. BUY THIS FILM NOW!! p.s I am a teenager and I love this film.
B008XG1X18|4.0|no matter what you're into, pinterest has something you will want to pin and access your creative side.  A social forum for sharing ideas, beauty, crafts, and inspiration in such an easy and unique way.  So fun.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book was one of the best books I have read by this author.  I was looking for a book to read after Fifty and there was so many recommnedations for the first book, Bared to You.  I was a little hesistant but when I finished the first book, I could not wait for the second book.  I read Reflect in You in one day.  I just could not put it down.  I kept saying I will put it down in 30 minutes, than a hour.  I just could not put it down.  I will not spoil this for anyone, but you have got toread this page turning, sometimes funny, and a few moments that will make you cry book.  Kudo's to Sylvia Day.  Can't wait for the last one in the Crossfire series.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|No one had to pull the wool over my eyes to see that this was truly a masterpiece of work! Hugh Howey has just become my favorite author. The characters, plot, pacing all are on target to make a gripping tale of survival and hope. I could not put this book down as read on my new kindle fire HD until my battery died.  The main character, Juliette, you can really identify with. There is a fan art of her I found on the author's website that really gives her beauty justice. Check it out: [...]. But anyways, really awesome book and I would highly recommend it!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love this app. It has been a lifesaver. It has a great interface and is easy to use. It is great for everything from bookmarking things on the web to making grocery lists.
B008XX6J92|5.0|I purchased my first Barbra album in 1962---still have them---even on 8 track and cassette.  All are my favorite!  But, the one that means the most is Simply Streisand and What about Today.  Actually, I had all up to 1970 with me in Vietnam.  The other day, I received my \\"Release Me\\"---I have played and played it over and over---it reminded me why I had fallen in love with her voice.  The Best Album of Barbra's in years. Love \\"Lost in Wonderland\\", \\"Didn't We\\", \\"Willow Weep for Me\\", and etc.................All of them--wish I could give 10 stars.  Lloyd Hood
B009JBZH54|5.0|This edition will contain the movie and a book that will described the three parts of this trilogy.<br />If you are a fan of this trilogy, wait for the Special Edition that is coming out the first semester of 2013. If you only want the movies without the extras, then buy this.
B00846REIS|4.0|Very interesting. Good read. Looking forward to reading next book in series. You can really feel the lust between  the  main characters.
B0031RAOW8|5.0|I can watch this movie over and over.  If you have a loyal and loving dog, you'll know what I mean.  Excellent.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|It simple enough for small changes here and there. I am not serious about photography, but it's still fun to play around with it.
0345803485|5.0|Great book series!!! Not for the faint hearted. But this book is about more than just sex. There is a story line to it.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I'm not one to usually write reviews but I couldn't help myself. Although completely dysfunctional, you can't help but to sympathize with everything Gideon and Eva have endured. What a great story of two people who have experienced great pain in their past but have been able to help each other in a way that only they could help each other. I can't wait for book 3, just hate that we have to wait 3 months for it.
B0087HT36U|4.0|title says it hallmark. enjoy this game whenever you have a few minutes.  this is not that challenging.  you'll have fun.
B008I3QZKU|5.0|No surprise that this album isn't what every individual fan expected/wanted from the Killers of 2012. To me, Battle Born is the crescendo true Killers fans are looking for. Go listen to \\"Flesh and Bones\\" and \\"Deadlines and Commitments\\" ... if you do not fancy either, you were never a Killers fan to begin with.<br /><br />Brandon's voice lessons paid off and the drums that we rock fans have yearned for have returned. Just like \\"Runaways\\", every song on the album is a wonderful combination of the sounds of their previous albums (sadly Day & Age as well). Overall great listen. Don't be a hater, be a Victim.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|it is just like the game at fairs. it's a no brainer game, but fun in a no stress way. graphics are great. playing on moto electrify.
159448385X|4.0|i didn't actually read a single page of this book. this is my first audiobook and it was an awesome one to start with. this story was captivating enough that driving around West Texas wasn't an unbearably bleak business trip. I was blown away by the lives the women in this story led, and even more astounded by how possible it was that their stories are exactly like many, if not most, women in Afghanistan. It was eye opening and heart wrenching.
B000SEGUDE|1.0|Amazon is seriously going to try to charge more for the Kindle edition than the hard copy? That doesn't make any sense.
