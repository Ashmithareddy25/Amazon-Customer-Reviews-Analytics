B008D28HYS|5.0|I loved the monochromatic version of this app, and so when the color version was the faotd, I gladly downloaded it. Its puzzles include some very easy ones and some nerve-wracking ones, so it should appeal to anyone who enjoys solving puzzles. I highly recommend this app, even at full price.
B005LAIHR2|5.0|I love every part of this movie. It was fantastically done and Tom Cruise is phenomenal! Such a great movie!
B001I0T92Q|4.0|This tiny adapter worked well after inserting it on my psp slim. The digital games I had all worked great and there weren't any noticeable slowdowns on the PSP. However the adapter feels flimsy like it would break if you were to bend it a little bit with your fingers. Also it did not fit on my PSP Phat and got stuck. I honestly thought I had lost it there but I managed to remove it at the verge of fear of breaking it.<br /><br />As long as you never take it out of your psp ( Why would you want to anyway? ) then it will serve you great and give you great space for a very low low price. And of course as long as you have some good MicroSDs in it.
B008QE9XD2|5.0|I do love this movie because it's Johnny Depp...come on who doesn't love him? I mean I know it's not the old show that everyone loved but it does have it's own qualities that make it great. :)
B005P68PSI|5.0|Supernatural is a series that has been on for 8 seasons now but I had not discovered it until this past halloween when it was run 24 hours straight on one of the networks. It was a hidden gem to me and I am very glad to have discovered it. Amazon does a great job of streaming it in HD to my Roku without a hiccup! Basically two brothers (Sam and Dean) run around the country busting supernatural creatures butts. You'd think it would get old but it doesn't really as each new episode adds a twist and all are very well written. As with all TV shows the characters are a bit inconsistent from season to season as far as I can tell but not so much as to draw attention to the fact. What is consistent is the stories are good and plot twists never disappoint.  If you like occult, mysterious and supernatural shows in general do yourself a favor and watch a few episodes.. chances are you'll be hooked too!
B006LSZECO|4.0|. . . and I was not disappointed. Flynn's writing is so strong. The only thing I could say is that I wanted it to end differently.  But, the twist provided is right in line with the crazy path delivererd through out.
B0083P1QUM|2.0|I found the story line slow and tedious.  I really miss the fast paced mystery of her earlier books - I was a big fan then, not now.  I really don't think that I'll be buying any more of her books.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This book was an unstoppable read.  I could not put it down. I love books about the struggle and victories of women and The Kitchen House delivered.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love the colors and the &#34;fluid&#34; background with those flowing waters sound.  I chose this because it was different from my usual choice of word games.  It begins easy and then progressively challenging.  It is not your usual &#34;match the dots&#34; game!
B006BAEQB2|3.0|These books are always a fun and interesting read. But, I wish Ms. Gregory would include geneology maps or something to remind us who the characters are related to from previous books. It took me a while to get regrounded.
B009PU2SX8|4.0|Excellent album by a true musician and soulful singer.  I've thoroughly enjoyed this album.  Make certain to check out a few of his live performances on Youtube.  I found one where he's performing with The Guess Who.  Fantastic!
B009CG2YDE|4.0|I like it. I'm surprised nobody thought of this type of simple game until now. combines many other game ideas.
B008ELUEQC|4.0|I have been waiting years for Rod to do a Christmas Albulm.<br />,<br />This is a great mellow CD, I would have loved a litlte rockin, Rod
B003LSTK8G|5.0|Michael Lewis does an excellent job in explaining the complex financial world to the reader in terms that are easy to understand. Wall street really is a fraudulent world that will continue to screw the common man until they are forced into jails and have their wealth drained and tossed into the gutter. Without real concrete consequences, how is “wrong“ perceived? A great, informative read.
B004P4S4NM|5.0|The is the best CD I have bought in years. The songs are meaningful and a treat for the ears. I played this CD so many times.
1419703692|5.0|I am a big big Batman movie fan and I finished reading this book about three days ago. I have to say it is even better than what I can ever imagine. Don't miss it if you are a Batman movie fan.
B00973902K|5.0|This song was a must for me. I'm glad I bought it. The song is very uplifting and pumps me up on down days.
B009IQ0TGM|2.0|I found this album very different from her first album.  Much slower and more personal.  It may appeal to some people but I liked her first album which was upbeat and faster paced a lot better.  I'm waiting to see if this one grows on me as it does have a very pleasant sound to it.
B00130EVSS|5.0|I like this movie because of the excellent acting. Story line was understandable unlike many other movies.<br />Keeps you interested.
B00A6N7BS0|4.0|Much better than expected and wow is Blake Lively gorgeous. I didn't care for the lame do-over ending but over a good movie.
B005A1ER0I|5.0|The feeling and emotion that is put into the album is amazing.! I Recommend to everyone. great buy. thank you
B0091XRL86|3.0|Not the best but decent for a one time watch with the kids or family. Kind of boring to me however.
B0020M99LC|5.0|I love James Bond Movies. This is a must see. So happy I could rent this from Amazon. The Amazon Prime Membership is totally worth it!
B0027I93U6|5.0|How can you not like DEXTER? If you havent watched DEXTER I highly recommend you start!<br /><br />It can be brutal and or gory for anyone wonder, so if you're easily offended or disturbed then maybe check out Twilight like all the other fools.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|This item is a perfect gift for anyone who is a Star Trek fan. All the movies are here in one collection!
B007BLUD30|2.0|Not a good movie at all. Waste of money, dont buy or watch. I wish I could have 2 hours of my life back.
B008KEQMDC|3.0|not much to say on this It wasn't a true look on expecting babies. Not enough research done to enjoy<br /><br />What To Expect When You're Expecting [DVD + Digital Copy]<br />Cameron Diaz<br /><br />It's okay
B009GEEMLY|1.0|Wow, the villains are identical to PowerRanger villains with their puffy, foam costumes that took $5 to make.<br /><br />This is why DC fails over and over. Blah.
B005LAII08|5.0|The grandkids loved it. They watched every minute of it.  Even adults enjoyed it.  The color the story were all above expectations.
B007UXT6T6|4.0|Although Tom Cruise is a Mr Creeper Creeperson, Ive always enjoyed the MI series. This one is no different and one of the best in the series for sure.
B0084IG8TM|2.0|Once again, commerce beats cinematic art. A potentially great movie is buried in this watered-down adaptation of Suzanne Collins' futuristic bestseller. Despite a memorable cast and imaginative production design, the filmmakers lack the hard edge and tight pacing to deliver the goods. Director Gary Ross' reliance on shaky camera work (combined with his choppy editing technique) evades the novel's harsh violence and dramatic tension for a safe PG-13 rating. Rather than going for the sociological jugular, \\"The Hunger Games\\" pulls its punches. Hopefully, the sequel will benefit from stronger direction and less filmmaking by committee.
B009D5VPTI|5.0|The best animated movie Ive seen since Lion King.<br /><br />I'm simply blown away by the story and execution of this movie. Very good story with a great moral. Must have for any family!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I rarely get excited about a new (to me) author, but weeks later, I'm still thinking about the world crafted by Mr. Howey. It has found its way into my brain, and is refusing to leave. The constraints operating upon life within the confined universe are well-thought-out and the logical end-product of the kinds of dynamics seen with civilizations throughout our history. This only adds to the credibility of the setting, and makes the characters all the more human.<br /><br />After reading Wool #1, I was deeply hooked, and was very happy to see this collection of the remaining books, and I would absolutely love to see more tales set in this world.
B008Z9YGEE|1.0|Im not a religious person or spiritual person by any means and am rarely offended but this movie is disturbing.<br /><br />How any adults, especially adults with kids could approve this for their kids is crazy. Kids murdering kids is NOT ok in any form.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Not the best of Grisham's books but still a decent read.  Pretty good plot, interesting characters, well developed story line.
B000SW4DV2|5.0|I love Robots as much as my daughter does. I highly recommend this to any adult or kid alike. Very good animated movie.
0547884591|5.0|I've never bought a cookbook, and personally don't have much interest in learning to cook. But it took about 3 pages of 4 Hour Chef to get hooked. As I've come to expect from this author - there's always a HUGE amount of valuable content. I'm only about 10% of the way through the book right now, and if it ended right now I'd still feel like I got my money's worth.
B00932A2MC|4.0|Yes cheesy but very entertaining and thats all I watched it for, entertainment. If I want a movie for story line, Id watch something  else.<br /><br />the blonde, is gorgeous too.
B004LUS390|5.0|This app worked very well and was a cool little free app.  I would definitely recomend it to anyone looking to doodle.
B004SVM7BW|4.0|I spent only $2.99 for this app 2 days ago and it was well worth it! I was hoping it would do what I wanted it to do. 1) Allow me to highlight & underline using different colors when studying. 2) Allow me to make annotations alongside highlighted selections. 3) Allow me to get to a page much faster (in books containing 1000 or more pages) without that 30 second lag that you get with other apps. It works so well that I actually WANT to study! I didn't give it 5 stars because I'm still waiting to figure out how to open & read the notes that I made. (lol... it's probably something simple!) I also want to be able to write in a foreign language & have the words be recognized.  Overall... I would highly recommend this.
0547884591|5.0|I've been cooking for years but never really took time to get the fundamentals.  This is a great way to do that, be entertained by someone (finally) that doesn't take themselves too seriously, and get a book full of great recipes to boot.<br /><br />I've been a fan since before 4HB came out, but grabbed and still follow that diet and philosophy today.  I pre-ordered 4 Hour Chef over a year ago and it was a great surprise to hear that all (with a few exceptions) recipes actually adhere to the slow carb diet Tim outlines in that book.  There's a certain level of continuity of philosophy there that I can really get behind.<br /><br />The time and care that went into this thing is apparent.  Get the print edition and you'll be rewarded.  This coming from a devout e-book reader in the amazon/kindle ecosystem. Some things just deserve that tactile and physical presentation, not to mention the time and effort that went into layout and organization that you'd lose on the kindle.<br /><br />Keep it coming Tim.
0547884591|4.0|I'm a huge fan of Tim Ferriss and the 4-Hour books. His approach to cooking, and life in general, seems contrary to the norm and thank God for that. We need more outside the box thinking, learning, and cooking. We need simple tools and concepts that apply inside and outside of the kitchen and the 4-Hour Chef has them. I am going to include this book on my recommended reading list for all of my patients. So often I am asked for recipes on what to cook that is healthy. I know it isn't actually recipes my patients need, but a tutorial on how to navigate their way around the kitchen. The 4-Hour Chef is a brilliant place to start.  Thanks Tim!<br /><br />~Peter Swanz, ND, FHANP
B003MC5N28|5.0|I bought it to read to my class but loved it for myself! Very intriguing! Couldn't put it down! Love!
B000HKW7E0|5.0|This is an annual &#34;must see&#34; ritual for the. family.  A classic that should be a part of your library.

B0090SVDO0|4.0|The star rating is my review. I do not like Amazon insisting I write more before my star rating is accepted. I decide whether I say more NOT them. I'm the customer.
0446580848|5.0|A typically great DeMille book......with a lot of action, and in the DeMille manner, a lot of humor.....You won't be disappointed in this one....
B006LSZECO|5.0|I'm amazed at how the author was able to write such a complex plot, keep all the details straight, and play with the readers' minds. I'm still reeling from the ending!
0385535147|5.0|In the Grisham tradition, another bestseller.....I understand this may be a movie as well.  This one has a twist, and will definitely keep you involved.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I have read a few books on &#34;life after death&#34;, what I really liked about this one was that he was a skeptic when his patients would tell him of their experience. He analyzed it with a scientific mind instead of just blind faith.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book.
B0063IH60K|4.0|fun little free game. could do with less ads;but thats what you get for free!<br />all in  all a good game.
B005DOJ68K|5.0|Gotta love CCR. This is a great compilation that makes me want to buy their albums which pre-dated my own existence.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|This was a fun movie for 2 adults and a 14 year old girl. There was excitement and fun from the beginning, with great visuals and music. And the dialog had us all laughing and waiting for what happended next. A beautiful story line that focused on the push by a young girl to claim her place in her world.
B0046B3QTG|5.0|Delightful little thimble creatures. Happy ending! Bright colors, lots of action! Maybe a little much for the imagination. Something ma still be missing in the desert.
B001KQZ7I8|5.0|This book should be required reading in highschool.. it's insight to the human experince and the inside of a Nazi death camp, are eye opening
B004L0NGEC|5.0|this app does exactly what it says it does.  I am very satisfied with my purchase.  Recommend to any Google User who uses Google photos. (such as picasa or google plus) .
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Not sure of the exact historu of this event, but this telling seems to reflect more truthful telling.  It also makes one understnad just what it means to &#34;stand in harms way.&#34;<br /><br />These people are true heros, not those sports cry babies.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book gives hope to all believers that all pain and suffering of mind and spirit will be erased in the other higher realm of our existence.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I have loved the Weather Channel app for several years on both my phone and my Kindle Fire.  It has had some issues but they have seemed to fix those issues once they are known.  The latest issue was with you not being able to get the latest info, would be old and there was no refresh button.  The app now has a refresh button, and always seems to have the latest info when I open it.<br />However, I recently purchased a Kindle Fire HD.  The first app that I installed was the Weather Channel app.  After a few days, I began to notice that my Fire HD had no battery life.<br />I fully charged it.  Went to bed and read for just a little bit.  Made sure the wifi was turned off.  When I woke in the morning, I only had 36% of battery left.  And it was asleep all night.<br />So after playing with it for several days, turning this and that off, uninstalling different apps, I've come to find out that it is the Weather Channel app that is sucking the battery life out of the Fire.  I have now uninstalled it and gone are the battery issues.  I can go to bed at night and it loses at most 2-3% of it's battery life over night.<br />And I can now believe that the Fire does have an 11 hour battery life.  Previously, I was getting, at most, 4 hours of use.<br />I gave the app 3 stars because it IS a super great app.  And I'm hoping that the developers will soon look at the problem of why it is using so much battery power.<br />I just want an app, that when I click on it, I can find out the weather forecast for my home and a few selected cities.  I don't want it to keep running when I'm not using it.
B009LK6JS2|4.0|At first glance, it is too difficult to master the flight controls and tactics. Yet, after taking the well laid out and relatively quick  training runs, the game becomes really cool and fun to play. It feels quite real. For an experience on Samsung Galaxy S3 (US), I was pleasantly impressed. While it is not at the level of MS Flight Simulator, it is quite a neat experience for a three minute sortie while waiting for a train...
B002PEP4U0|3.0|the story is interesting but the writing is only fair. would be a better read if  story moved along more crisply and was more focused. got bored with the profusion of detail that did not seem particularly germane to the story line.
B004I744AS|5.0|I thought that this app was pretty lame,but when I got it,every time I look up a word there it is, ready for me to read and understand.
B008HJGPVO|5.0|Use with my Kindle touch and Paperwhite.  I tried using the tip of a pencil, forget it and sometimes fingers get in the way. This has 3 heads and a clip so it doesn't roll around.  Would like to have it in colors, especially yellow.
0547884591|5.0|Ok, I first bought the kindle version and then bought my son the hardback, and I am so jealous!  I just got the book in the mail and it is so beautiful!!!  I have really enjoyed my kindle version, but the hardbook is worth every penny!  I am going to have to borrow his copy.  My son is 17 and he has loved all of Tim's books, they have given him confidence.  Thank you Tim for the knowledge that you have shared.
B008WCP2PG|3.0|Love the cast but the whole movie was just a little off. I don't think they really developed the relationships as well as they could of. Mostly just all about ripping their clothes off haha
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great story, with a look on the inside of some of the elite forces of the U.S.  I would recomend to anyone wanting an indepth view of what led up to and what happened to UBL on that fateful night.
B004529NKC|5.0|I really loved the original and I actually think that the sequels haven't disappointed. This is a great dance movie and a pretty good movie plot-wise.
6305428042|4.0|This is a fun movie to share with the kids at Halloween. There are a few scenes that are a bit suggestive, but overall you shouldn't have any awkward moments with the young ones.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|This movie gives us a glimpse of the ways love manifests itself as we grow old and how we integrate our pasts into our dwindling present.  Every character in the cast is an iconic representation of an old woman or man coming to terms, or perhaps forming new terms, for this period of their lives.  It is certainly a movie for my generation and, hopefully, our children will watch and take a second look at us--the ones with wrinkles and double-chins who know what love is and need it just as much as we ever did.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I was a little disappointed in this Grisham book. Compared to  his other books,I felt the story was hard to follow.
B009YU62H2|5.0|They stayed true to thier old stuff and every song is great! Hope they don't wait that long before thier next release
B0098VYCCE|4.0|Better than the 3 star rating it was given.  watched with my daughters - ages 21 and 20 - and we all felt the same
B009E3EY38|2.0|This is the third bluray concert dvd from Amazon and all three have the same problem ..... sound.  I know it's not Amazon's fault, but they need to check these out before agreeing to sell.<br /><br />Nothing wrong with Jason's drumming, John Paul's bass, Jimmy's lead or Robert's vocals.  The whole problem is the constant changing of images, and the sound mixing.  What a disappointment.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game! it is absolutely worth the price! don't quite understand the concept of the Tnt. but other than than that great game

B00030DEQE|4.0|This PCI network adapter gets 5 stars for performance, but 3 stars for workmanship.<br /><br />The network adapter did what it was supposed to do. It upgraded my PC from 10/100 to 10/100/1000 performance, but only after I had to remove the face plate and modify both the card and the face plate to get them to fit my machine. The tab at the bottom of the face plate was too wide--approximately 0.020\\" (just over 1/64\\") too wide--so it would not fit into the slot on my computer's case, which uses a standard, high profile face plate. I had to remove it from the card and file the tab to get it to fit into the slot on the computer case. After filing the tab, but before putting it back onto the adapter card, I tried plugging the card into the PCI slot. It would not fit, so I measured the slot and the pin tab that plugged into it. The pin tab was approximately 0.010\\" (ten one-thousandths of an inch) too wide. It had to sand the edge of the pin tab on the end nearest the face plate until it fit into the PCI slot. Luckily there was no pin at the very end of the pin tab, so I was able to do that without compromising the integrity of the adapter.<br /><br />I wouldn't have been too surprised at having such manufacturing defects on a cheap card from an unknown company, but I was disappointed that Intel would let such defects get by its quality control. I was disappointed; but in a fast-paced mass production environment, I can forgive one or two errors. That's just the way it is when things are spot checked instead of every part being checked. I was surprised, though that both components, the card and the face plate, each from a different department, were out of tolerance.<br /><br />I have worked as a machine fabricator, building precision machinery of various types from scratch, for 49 years; and I've never had a machine come back because of ill-fitting parts. I attribute the ill-fitting face plate to dull dies, because there were burrs all around the edge of the metal plate. If the press operator had sanded the burrs off and smoothed the edges, the tab would have fit. The card itself did not have rough edges, so dull dies were not responsible for that error. I have to wonder if Intel might have had a whole batch of ill-fitting cards, perhaps from farming them out to a company that didn't see the importance of keeping dimensions within tolerance.<br /><br />Regardless of the reasons why both the face plate and the adapter card were out of tolerance or who was responsible, it reflects badly upon Intel. It wasn't serious enough for me to vow not to buy another Intel product, but it does make me wonder about their care in making their CPUs.the press operator had sanded the burrs off and smoothed the edges, the tab would have fit.

0679809015|5.0|Easy, interactive book to read to little ones.  It's basically a small book to review animal sounds.  Arrived on time.
B00028493E|4.0|It mentioned in the description that it was maybe an &#34;international&#34; or &#34;european&#34; version and wouldn't play on USA DVD players.  Thankfully my son could watch it on his laptop.  It's exactly what it said It was.  I should have read more closely!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|The quality of DISC 1(the 3D Blu-Ray Video Disc),is superb,with 7.1 channels of surround HD sound to match.I also enjoyed the bonus features on DISC 2(the regular 2D Blu-Ray Disc),and DISC 3(regular DVD disc),also includes a bonus extra.The set also includes The DISC 4(Digital Copy), of the film and the \\"Avengers Assemble\\" Digital Album.all in all a nice package(the outer sleeve has a lenticular motion effect front cover),but for the expensive price for this set I expected, wanted,and would have liked a few more bonus extra features on the discs themselves.I recommend it anyway but with certain reservations of course.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|hands down, the BEST app i have EVER purchased! absolutely stunning, strong story line, and scary! its the best app i have ever come across. perfect!

B004EWFV9K|3.0|In 25 words, more or less: I can no longer bear the anxieties and soul searching that have plagued Det. Wallander in  Henning Mankell's series. Before picking up Troubled Man, I finished The White Lioness  and found it a refreshing departure in theme: a plot to assassinate Nelson Mandela soon after his release from prison. Mankell has ties to Africa, through a theater group there.<br /><br />Because I have grown weary of  Wallander's neurotic behavior, I feel as though Troubled Man is too long by half. The story line advances so slowly that I barely care about the fate of a former Swedish naval officer who may or may note be dead, whose wife may or may not have been involved in East German politics back in the day.<br /><br />Mankell has a new novel out that breaks new ground. He has a novel in Spanish about an orphaned African boy.<br /><br />I love this man's writing. When all is said  and done,  I will continue to read his work.
160094048X|5.0|I ordered this for my husband, he is not a cook but he really wanted to bake vegan cookies. He has tried several recipes and I am shocked to discover he makes the best cookies I've ever tasted! This book is nothing short of miraculous! We are both enjoying the great horizons that are ahead in the vegan cookie department. Who would have thought my husband could bake? Highly recommended!
B005ZO6NRA|5.0|It has the perfect amount of action and adventure as well as love scenes and scifi parts that make it one of<br />the best movies out there.
B007S3S8HO|1.0|My son was so excited when we purchased this toy, then we put it together.  It was terrible to get the pieces to stay attached to each other.  Then you would have to stack parts of the set and they barely matched up.  It was frustrating for all of us (my husband included).  Even when sitting on a table, if the table moved the entire thing fell apart.  The company needs to look into how to get parts to stay together.  A disappointment.
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|I liked the book and the way it flowed through the plot, there were some parts where I cheered outloud. Because a certain event happened. Highly recommended
1451627297|4.0|This book is a very good read.... Stephen King gives a hypothetical, through time travel, of what would have happened if President John Kennedy were never assassinated back in 1963.  The results of this time travel held my interest and projected me back in the time Oswald was planning this killing.  Interesting all the way through!
1401923127|5.0|On one hand I have tried to find serious critique for Lipton's ideas and facts. But even if there are some people who say that someone is wrong - what it changes?<br /><br />Bruce Lipton with this book revitalized my old curiosity for biology and life of cells. Some ideas are just outstanding - genes are just blueprints, while membrane is a brain, and constant communication with environment and each other shape our life.<br /><br />I really like the idea that evolution may be guided not only by struggle but cooperation too. I was shocked to know that genes can be passed without reproduction mechanisms.<br /><br />For a moment I think this book is worth reading for all the inspiration it gives. But beware PSYCH-K BS in the end is awkward, and I don't agree with spiritual and quantum physics based stuff.<br /><br />I really enjoyed reading this book, it gave me enough food for thoughts and ideas to believe and try.

1451695195|5.0|Proof of Heaven: A neurosurgeon's journey into the afterlife by Eben Alexander, Simon & Schuster, New York; Piatkus, London, 2012, 208 ff.<br /><br />A first-hand account of a near-death experience<br /><br />Most of the books on near-death experiences (NDEs) are written by authors who relate accounts given to them by other people. The books by Raymond Moody, Pim van Lommel and Michael Sabom are typical examples. This book, like that of Nanci Danison, is a first-hand account written by someone who has himself experienced an NDE.<br /><br />Dr Eben Alexander is a neurosurgeon. He had his first near-death experience as a parachute jumper when he nearly collided with another jumper. But it was the coma produced by an attack of bacterial meningitis in 2008 that provoked something of the kinds of mental images that are usually associated with NDEs. However, many of the incidents common to many NDE experiencers were missing. This event has however still led him to conclude that `our life does not end with the death of the body or the brain'.<br /><br />The first couple of chapters of the book describe some of the symptoms of Alexander's condition when he was ill - not for the squeamish, perhaps. But his recollections of the first period of his coma in another spiritual realm are equally vividly described - and fascinating. The whole description is given more weight by the fact that Alexander is a scientist who started this experience with the usual reservations if not scepticism about the existence of the psychic realm. I found the details that Alexander recounts more convincing of continuing discarnate existence than several I have read. The personal details of his life that the author includes get the reader more involved in the story - it's not some dispassionate scientific account of an experiment but a real-life experience of a living being. This account includes the personal events surrounding his emergence from coma.<br /><br />Eben Alexander wrote this book with the conviction that the importance of unconditional love and that science supports rather than contradicts the existence of the spiritual realm is such that it is imperative that it is understood by a majority of people on the planet before our obsessive materialism drives humankind to extinction. He knew also that he was forever part of the divine spiritual energy that he calls Om. He knows that the events and impressions he relates in this book are real - and he can distinguish them from the hallucinatory images he rambled about as he was recovering from his coma. During the coma, the attending physicians will attest to the fact that his conscious mind was dead.<br /><br />There is a good Index and a further Reading List at the end of the book together with an interesting consideration of nine neurological hypotheses that might explain Dr Alexander's experiences: none of which satisfies him or his colleagues - which leaves us with interpretation as a vision of `heaven'.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0061777269 Consciousness Beyond Life: The Science of the Near-Death Experience]]<br />[[ASIN:0062517392 Life After Life: The Investigation of a Phenomenon--Survival of Bodily Death]]he conviction that the importance of unconditional love and that science supports rather than contradicts the existence of the spiritual realm is such that it is imperative that it is understood by a majority of people on the planet before our obsessive materialism drives humankind to extinction.

B001TODCII|3.0|A young girl, Kim Mills (Maggie Grace), sets off for Europe to follow a pop group on tour. She is accompanied by her friend Amanda (Katie Cassidy). At the airport in Paris she is enticed by a young man to share a taxi to her apartment. Later, that same man has thugs kidnap Kim and Amanda to exploit them for prostitution. Now Kim's father, Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) is an ex-CIA man and is immediately on the case. The rest of the film is about Bryan's attempts to track down the kidnappers. There's lots of action as Mills demolishes all the Albanian and Islamic opposition as he rescues his girl, but the number of victims he manages to execute while hardly sustaining a scratch himself is scarcely believable. There is a sub-plot about Kim wanting to become a pop singer herself, but there are not really many surprises in the main or sub-plot.
B008F9VCC8|5.0|pretty good trilogy that keeps my attention going and helps pass the time. will continue reading this author when he publishes again.
B005LAII08|5.0|Brave is a spectacular movie. The animation is perfect, the colors are so bright and rich, and the detail is top notch.<br /><br />The 3D is wonderful, though there are not alot of pop outs, the depth is fantastic. It really helps to show the vastness of the movie. Even while watching in 3D this movie doesn't lose alot of color, which is a big plus. My only complaint with the 3D is that is doesn't full up the whole screen, you get the black bars on top and bottom, and I think that kind of hurts a 3D movie, but that's just my opinion.<br /><br />The story itself was really great. It was nice to see such a strong willed female lead. I have read a few negative reviews about nudity, but there is no need to worry, it was just a few bare butts and nothing else, hell you see worse on TV.<br /><br />I say buy this one, especially if you have younger children, I have five kids, 2 boys and 3 girls, with the oldest being 8, and they all loved this movie, as did my wife and I. Hope you enjoy it as much as we did!
B0081SRJSY|5.0|This is a great board game and works very well with the kindle fire.  I have only one complaint about it though when scoring happens at the end of the game there is seemingly no rhyme or reason to which players pieces score in what order so it gets confusing when wanting to track the additions, not only that but the actual point values flash on screen for a quarter of a second and in random positions on the screen. I would like to see a simple text box with the last few players score being updated e.g.<br />Player 1 Field: 8 pts.<br />and so on...<br />Other than that fantastic, hope to see an online multilplayer added and more expansions.

0547884591|2.0|This book doesn't come close to the great original 4HWW, nor even to the not quite as awesome 4HB.<br /><br />The book is disorganized and is hard to navigate, especially in ebook form.<br /><br />Another big issue I had with it is that doesn't really accommodate vegetarians. Not that I am one myself, but I don't like handling meat and there doesn't seem to be a way to avoid doing so since the lessons basically build upon one another.
B005LCYR7Y|5.0|...and I've read thousands of books over nearly 50 years.<br />It had everything I love, sci fi, reality, science, history.  Completely believable, beautifully written, a main character you like and can sympathise with.  Loved it.  Absolutely loved it.

B00A6PD9I4|2.0|Movie was really not worth watching that is my opinion, what a waste. 10 seconds of genuine emotion when mom was expected to turn back into human that's it, she was even bossy toward mom when she was a bear. Animation was good but I think plot was dreadful. They should have had the spell do something to the bratty girl instead of mom changing to bear. but we are entitled to our opinion.

B0090EHVMC|3.0|I actually had never read this Dr. Seuss book.  The kids talked me into renting it and it has a very good message.
1439152802|5.0|Kate Morton is one of the very few authors who will always be assured of having a prominent place in the very limited space on my book shelves. Her books are an anticipated treat for me, and \\"The Secret Keeper\\" was no exception. I bought this book thinking it would be my special read for Christmas vacation, but the torture of seeing it every day on my coffee table, waiting for me, calling my name, was just too much temptation.<br /><br />And so I immersed myself into her magical prose that almost read like poetry. It sang and danced on the page, and I often had this wonderful feeling of time traveling right into the story. Her characters are so well developed that I felt they were personal friends... or enemies.<br /><br />All through the book I was torn between wanting (needing!) to fly through the pages to know what would happen next and wanting to take my time because I didn't want it to end.<br /><br />When the end did come I was so engrossed in the story I didn't see it coming. And what a pleasurable delicious shock it was! Thank you, Ms Morton, for the magic.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|Not much.  Robert Downey, Jr. and Jude Lawson have portrayed some interesting characters in a marvelous way!  Love Sherlock and love the actors.
B000MD9UJC|4.0|I bought this to replace an older model LED that wouldn't let me adjust the beam. This one is much brighter and has an adjustable beam.  The pushbutton switch is a nice feature.  I fear that it might be the weak spot - it seems a little cheap and rattles, but so far it works fine.  It was definitely worth the money and a great upgrade over the stock mini-mag bulb.

B005WUHAX8|1.0|I think I had a defected case.  I bought this case for my girlfriend.  To begin with when I opened the box for the case, the little piece that controls the mute switch and the camera lens cover was loose in the box.  I carefully installed the case for my girlfriend by following the video on your website (very helpfull by the way).  The case did fully protect the phone but the phone call quality became very bad.  There was an echo whenever I or anyone spoke to her and she sounded very quiet on the phone (she is not a quiet person).  I think the screen protector was stretched out or something, it had what i can best describ as bumps (not air pockets or bubbles) which lead to an uneven surface.  I would like to return the product.
B008D28HYS|5.0|This is a great logic puzzle/crossword puzzle game. The colors make it a bit easier to solve than I would like, but I love it just the same!

I recommend this book to anyone and everyone and will most definitely gift several copies over the holidays.

B008IJT0CE|5.0|Wanted Music for evenings while primitive horse camping (no power, no water - except what you bring, just a bare spot to park truck with small camper and horse trailer with space to highline my horse.) After log day's rides and FINALLY time to put my feet up, music is wonderful before turning in. Had a Kindle HD that wasn't being used much. Just added small speakers and headphones (when privacy wanted) and bought this app to see if music on the Kindle HD would be good quality. It's a wow! Saved the cost of an iPod and individual song purchase just to start. Really a nice app. I'll now be looking for more music. Glad we have the Kindle HD! And now - on to other apps ...

0811879542|5.0|Who knew the simple magic of reading simple &#34;press here&#34; type instructions would evoke such surprise and laughter from little children.  The only complaint is you'll definitely have to read this multiple times in a row.  But that's not a complaint, now is it? :)
B001GCUO16|5.0|I LOVE THIS MOVIE! Hugh Jackman is the best wolverine! It is fantastic along with all of the other X Men movies. I highly recommend this movie and the rest of the movies.
B000SEFM6K|3.0|I purchased the Kindle version of this book because of so many positive reviews. The plot and characters are intriguing, but it took me a month to get through it. As with many books of the time, the narration is long and drawn out. Thought processes are explained in too much detail.<br /><br />The dialogue is good, even great at times. One of my favorite lines comes from an antagonist:  \\"I am thinking,\\" he said, \\"whether I shall add to the disorder in this room, by scattering your brains about the fireplace.\\" During scenes like this one, I'm glad to have read it. But at other times, after pages of \\"thought explanation\\", I was happy to be done with it.<br /><br />I did appreciate some of the characters and narratives from varying viewpoints (along with bits of humor), but I don't recommend this to someone who is not a fan of Victorian literature.
B004LWZW4C|5.0|This movie was better than I expected. I had waited to see it a long time and finally did. I was glad I did! It was a great addition to the trilogy and now another is being made!
B007EECSFA|4.0|I previously read the Forgotten Garden by Kate Morton and enjoyed that book very much.<br /><br />The Secret Keeper certainly lived up to my expectation of Kate Morton as a story teller based on the previous book, by her, which I had read.<br /><br />The story begins in 1961 when young Laurel witnesses and incredible action caused by her mother.  The shocking event stays with Laurel through her life.  Fast forward to 2011 when Laurel's mother is dying.  Laurel wants to get to the truth of the event.  In order to tell how the 1961 event came to occur requires going back in time to the early 1940's and the Blitz which occurred over London.<br /><br />The book, is one, which is difficult to put down.  The story keeps driving forward with unexpected twists and turns, until the incredible conclusion.<br /><br />This is one story worth reading.
B006OV7RQ4|4.0|The psychological study \\"Martha Marcy May Marlene\\" is one of the more fascinating films of 2011. An independent critical hit, the subtle drama details a young woman's attempt to adjust to society after years in a rural New York cult. Using the word \\"cult\\" awakens memories of David Koresh ([[ASIN:0815605021 The Ashes of Waco: An Investigation]]) and Charles Manson ([[ASIN:1560253967 The Family]]), and first-time writer/director Sean Durkin has created a quietly menacing atmosphere recalling both cultural disasters.<br /><br />The film's main character, Martha, joins the cult commune, where men and a larger number of women work the fields of an isolated farm. Existence is anything but sunshine, as days are overcast, laughter kept to a minimum and thunder roils on the horizon. The cult's leader is Patrick, skillfully played by John Hawkes ([[ASIN:B00498TQV8 Winter's Bone]]) in yet another role displaying why he's one of the more fascinating talents working today. He juggles word games in seductive Mansonesque manner, discussing death as ultimate nirvana and acceptance of his family's system as the only true love.<br /><br />Martha's time within the cult is seen in flashback. The film opens with her escaping through the woods as she stumbles to a pay phone. She's soon residing with her older sister Lucy (Sarah Paulson) and brother-in-law Ted (Hugh Dancy) at their palatial lake house where they are vacationing, sleeping more often than not, unable to discuss where she's been for the last two years. With some trepidation, Lucy and Ted become Martha's protectors, and it's apparent their status-conscious lives have left them ill-equipped to deal with the depth of her mental warfare. A professionally successful Manhattan couple, they're shocked by Martha's uninhibited behavior as she casually goes skinning dipping and enters their bedroom while they're having sex. Martha also has an embarrassingly violent episode during a formal cocktail party.<br /><br />The passive yet complex role of Martha is brilliantly played by newcomer Elizabeth Olsen. The film is seen almost entirely from her viewpoint as she struggles from paranoia, with dreams of her time within the cult seeping into daily existence. Through reoccurring flashbacks we witness her indoctrination, including forced sex with Patrick and a variety of home invasion crimes. At night she imagines cult members throwing rocks at her window. Like a scarred soldier, Martha is mentally shell-shocked. When Lucy attempts to indoctrinate her into their own society, shown by the clothes provided or the makeup painted onto her face, Durkin is obviously creating a parallel universe of opposing yet oddly similar values. Both are defended passionately. When she questions the need for such a large lake house overflowing with material possessions, she is thoroughly chastised by Ted during a fit of anger. When she voices unhappiness about a crime committed within the cult, she is threatened by Patrick in a similar outburst.<br /><br />During conversations with Lucy throughout the film, we learn Martha was a school dropout, without parents, making her a perfect target for the cult. We can't help but recall the infamous Manson girls, identically dressed with shaved heads, marching to the courtroom in unison. We read Vincent Bugliosi's [[ASIN:0553278290 Helter Skelter]] and see the films ([[ASIN:B0001AVZM6 Helter Skelter]]) where Manson is the dramatic focus. I'm not sure we've seen a work dealing exclusively with a female cult victim and how she begins to follow beliefs opposing American society.<br /><br />We could question Durkin's intentions when comparing the veiled similarities of respectable society to the cult's sexist and violent existence. When Martha is forced to take tranquilizers after her outburst at the cocktail party, we are reminded of the drugs used by the cult during her indoctrination. There's also intended irony in the film's final conflict, when Lucy realizes Martha needs serioushelp. She is to be committed to an institution where she will be cared for and reprogrammed to learn new morals and values, which is exactly what happened within the cult.<br /><br />Let me honestly say I hated the ending of \\"Martha Marcy May Marlene.\\" With contemplation, I realized it was imaginings within Martha's damaged mind. She's unable to swim or even drive down a sunny street without seeing ominous signs of cult members nearby. Martha was traumatized, akin to veterans of war, and has a long way to go before escape. Where Durkin goes a step further is by asking, \\"Escape to what?\\" A uniquely haunting film, beautifully photographed, that will get under your skin.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|This was such a different story and one I absolutely loved.  It is one story that touches on all the big life questions.  I was suprised by the stories events and touched by the characters journey.  I would most certainly recommend this book to a friend and will definitely look for more books by Rachel Joyce.
0547884591|5.0|Let me start by stating that I'm a huge Tim Ferriss fan and have purchased all of his books (both HC and e-book editions of all three).  I've only read the first 120 pages thus far, but the META chapter alone is worth several times the cost of the book.  You will learn strategies that will enable you to learn massive quantities of material in a modicum of time.<br /><br />Some people are putting forth conspiracy theories regarding the amount of reviews that have surfaced within the last 24 hours.  Tim recently published a blog post asking his readers to kindly write a review if they are currently reading the book.  He has a very loyal following, so I'm sure that is where the influx of reviews came from.<br /><br />I'll update my review once I've finished the book.
B009RI4FRU|4.0|This was a strange but interesting plot for a movie.  It inevitably leaves you feeling good after many opportunties for disaster.
0307744434|4.0|This book came highly recommended to me, and though I enjoyed it very much, I did not give it the ultra 5 stars my friends said it was. Four stars will do for this book which was a face paced, lovely look at a world full of magic and intrigue, love and wanting. You are definitely in a front row seat to a circus the world has never seen, where the magic is real, though the visitors don't know it.<br /><br />On top of all this you have two characters, Celia and Marco, who are pitted against one another in a game that began in childhood. The unfortunate thing is, is that the two contestants don't know the rules of the game, and for some time who their opponent is. When they do finally discover each other, they can't help but fall head over heels in love and willing to risk all to be together instead of winning the game.<br /><br />This book is quite a page turner. However, I suggest you slow it down a little a pay close attention to the dates and setting at the beginning of every chapter. You may get confused or lost since it yo-yo's back and forth a lot between earlier settings and later ones.
1444737112|5.0|and I wanted to read more.  Have ordered this as a stocking filler for my brothers xmas box.

Oh well.
B008WCP2PG|5.0|To sum it up in one word, &#34;wow!&#34; When you're young and unattached, why not sow some wild oats and live adventurously. Definitely a cute story-line and Channing Tatum in a thong...Need I say more?
B00881PPTO|3.0|Since the only difference between this app & the free one is removal of ads they shouldn't call it the \\"PRO\\" version as that implies more features of a 'professional' level. Instead it should be labeled the \\"AD FREE\\" version. I suppose Kayak can charge $1 to take out the ads but I really don't see the point in buying it unless you travel constantly & can't stand ads. Even then, it would do your pocketbook good to do your own research. I can tell you from experience that the prices these travel booking sites give you can differ a LOT from the price usually charged. I was staying in a hotel in Texas for a week and the people in the room next to ours had booked with Travelocity for the same. They were paying twice as much as the published rates! I'd gotten a weekly discount from those rates by calling the hotel directly, so I was paying barely a third of what the Travelocity folks were. Think about it, those sites have to make money somehow. Still, this is a nice streamlined app that does do what its supposed to. If you are crunched for time & need a package booked really fast without too much regard to getting the absolute lowest price this might be the way to go.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I do not watch much TV and am rarely to never one who watches a series, running to the TV at a certain time.  This was not true with Downton.  I was given season one and then bought season two for myself.  I have turned several family members on to it and they have bought it.  Season one and two were my 24 year old's birthday gift.
B0089ZEEYG|5.0|This game is very fun. It uses accellerometer for controls making it easy for the kids to play as well.

B00004Y6NX|5.0|I used to like Dire Straits as the best album...until i listened to this one.  it is by far a greater album in all respects.  the song writing and guitar work from Mark Knofler are great.  even the love song Romeo and Juliet is one i listen through each time.  a gem. Tunnel of Love is one of their best songs ever.  Expresso Love and Skate Away top it off.
B007FDE4Y8|4.0|So I've read the reviews and even with the expectations set because of them, I decided to buy and I must say, I am very pleased with the product, but I pity whoever included that dismal product guide.<br /><br />Right off the bat, I knew the instructions were going to be minimal, and they were barely even instructions at that. I had the YouTube balancing videos lined up, ready to take my turn at this accessory. The most common problem I've seen is that those who use a Rebel t3i with a kit lens (myself included) have been unable to balance this stabilizer properly with the included weight, and that is both incorrect and correct. The weights as configured will not stabilize this small rig because it is too light. I was able to bypass this by placing my camera in the back center of the mounting plate cross, shrinking my counterbalance arc, and taking the two twin add on weights, putting those on first, and then taping the smaller round weight, screw-side to screw-side, to the twin ones, and then like magic, everything fell into the place. The videos all made sense and I achieved the 2 second drop time of the arc. Yes, things should work as is right out of the box, but lets face it a lot of things don't and probably never will.<br /><br />So I say this to all those t3i users with the 18-55mm kit lens, your camera is only 1,031 grams, it is a light setup. Using the three lightest weights taped how I mentioned and then following the balancing videos will yield you your results. You still will have to fine tune the horizontal and vertical adjusters, but it will work! It just takes a little patience and good ol' fashion resourcefulness and...well...tape.<br /><br />Best of luck to all filmmakers and hobbyists!
B000002GBB|4.0|quick shipping on this item.  only problem was there was a skip or two  on one of the songs.  but, it wasn't new.  i also didn't contact them.  as for recommending this cd?  I was hoping for more of a harder cd from styx.  there are a lot of slower songs, keyboard/synthesizers.  not bad songs but Blue Collar Man and Renegade are the only ones with jamming James Young guitars.

B00AA7O6QC|1.0|To have so many high profile or at least once high provide actors the acting was horrible. Would not recommend this movie to anyone.
1451695195|5.0|I have read other books regarding the afterlife and peoples experience with it. This book wasn't like any of the others. It was like reading the New England Journal of Medicne. Butt I would reccomend it just the same.

0765316994|4.0|Redshirts was the November selection for my local book club. All of the members who read the book agreed that it was very funny and entertaining. We were all glad that we had read it.  It did help that all of us are fans of the Star Trek shows, though that is not required for one to read and enjoy this book.<br /><br /> I will admit, that I was the only member who did not make the connection of the title, RedShirts, with what was happening in the story.  It seems, that in the first series, Star Trek,  that when a crew member was killed on an away mission, they inevitably had a low level ranking and thus wore a red shirt.<br /><br />The Intrepid is the flagship of the Universal Union.  It's crew, with the exception of the captain and his 4 supporting officers, know that something is wrong, that a crew member will die every time there is an away mission led by one of the 'five'.  They do whatever they can to avoid an away mission the captain or any of the other four.  This being said, no one is attempting to do anything about this situation until red shirt wearer Ensign Andrew Dahl is assigned to the Intrepid.  Fortunately for the rest of the crew, he is not willing to accept the status quo and seeks an explanation and a solution to these untimely deaths.<br /><br />It seemed natural to me that the five new crew members: Dahl, Duvall, Hanson, Finn and Hester, would band together.  They were assigned to the Intrepid at the same time, and waited in the same departure lounge for hours awaiting their transport.  This quick camaraderie continued once they were aboard the Intrepid as they all noticed that something was amiss.<br /><br />During our book club meeting, we had an interesting discussion but we kept getting drawn off track by talk of our favourite Star Trek spin off and by particular episode plot lines.  My new term for the day was 'Treknology', having to do with the futurist technology used during the various shows, particularly the tricorder.  The best example of this in the book, is 'The Box' which is only used during times of extraordinary difficulty, when an improbable solution is needed in an impossibly short period of time.  For an explanation of how it works, you will have to read RedShirts.of this in the book, is 'The Box' which is only used during times of extraordinary difficulty, when an improbable solution is needed in an impossibly short period of time.

0066620996|4.0|This book was the main focus of a class I took. We take for granted the products and services that many companies provide and pay little attention when these companies fail. Most of all we don't pay attention to the very basic ideas that cause a company to fail. It is obvious that the authors put in a great deal of effort in picking and analyzing these companies. I thought it was a great read and has many ideas that companies should and could benefit from.<br /><br />For our class we had to interview a top level executive of a local company. This was during the deepest part of the recession and many companies were going through very trying times. We were able to interview a second generation President of a very large steel company. The first thing he told us when we sat down was that he had read the book in graduate school and tries to apply these ideas every day. The scheduled one hour interview went on for 4 hours. He had an amazing amount of information on the real world application of the concept and ideas of the book and it really showed me that this book has some great ideas that many companies could benefit from. He really spelled out the foundation of his company and how it has benefited from the ideas provided in the book. Determining his niche, finding the right people and putting them in the right spot, the hedgehog concept, etc. were all contributed to his success and ability to ride out the recession. I highly recommend this book.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|As we speak, it is a month before the movie is due to come out in theaters. I have been waiting for this for close to my entire life and rehashing the DVD is the only thing keeping me going right now. So: this performance was wonderful, pretty much every minute. The performance itself can't really be compared to the 10th Anniversary; it's a different entity. Some pieces were cut, some were added, a few lyrics were changed. The orchestra had a very different sound, most noticeably in Javert's Soliloquy where the melody as carried by the strings seemed to be completely lost. I don't know if that was deliberate or a flaw in the recording. But this is Les Mis, anyway, and it couldn't be bad no matter how hard it tried. The biggest difference between this and 10th is that this one had a set--just one, but used very creatively--and there was some acting, with a few small props, not just people standing at a microphone singing at each other. The overall effect was spellbinding and I did have tears in my eyes a few times (just the opening of \\"At the End of the Day\\" can do it for me!).<br />As for the singing:<br />Alfie Boe, a youngish operatic tenor, was not what we are used to vocally, but in a very nice way. Certainly he has that appropriately noble and saintly look.<br /> Lea Salonga did well as Fantine, but sounded so different from when she played Eponine--her voice then was so silvery and pristine where now it is richer, more vibrato. I wouldn't say she was better than and worse now, she has just developed in a rather different direction.<br />Norm Lewis makes Philip Quast look like somebody's kindly old grandpa. His performance is super-intense, disturbed, very human. The down-through-the-floor voice helps.<br />Enough has been said about poor Nick Jonas. I will add that I didn't think he was that bad. His singing was adequate, except his inability to sustain a note when required, and sometimes (like EC at ET) was better than adequate. It was his frozen pose and expression that were ridiculous. If you like close your eyes or turn off the screen or something it helps.<br />Ramin Karimloo--hmm. I can't tell you anything about his voice. I was too busy watching his dimples and those burning eyes. Might try turning my screen off next time with him too.<br />Katie Hall I thought had the loveliest soprano I have ever heard, sweet and yearning, not shrill for one second ever. I heard she was an understudy? I don't know who they could've had lined up that was better.<br />Samantha Barks was a showstopper. I'm happy she got the part in the movie. I did find her a tiny bit overpowering and am curious to see how that translates to the screen, especially after having heard Anne Hathaway's very subdued \\"I Dreamed a Dream.\\"<br />Who am I missing? The Thenardiers were loveably contemptible. Monsieur was considerably slimier than the last one and funnier too. Gavroche was the best I've seen and heard, outrageously cheeky. This kid is like the definition of Hugo's little gamin. There was a woman in the ensemble who I bet was related to him. They had a cute moment.<br />Other great moments: Fantine walking off literally into the light and turning to watch young Cosette as they cross paths. Enjolras' wordless exchange with Grantaire, hinting at the complicated relationship that till now the musical ignored. Cosette's \\"I'm awake...\\" And the extras. \\"Bring Him Home\\" with Colm Wilkinson cannot be described in human terms. The wonderful, adorable and irreplaceable Michael Ball: \\"My place is here...\\" Throughout the whole segment, I laughed and cried--frequently at the same time--and I wasn't the only one either; the camera stops several times on women in the audience who are smiling from ear to ear with mascara all over their faces.<br />Would I recommend this? Yeah, I don't know, I have to think about it. Just kidding. Buy it! Buy the 10th Anniversary too. Then buy the Complete Symphonic Recording, just to compare! And the original Broadway soundtrack, just for fun!<br />And with that I would like to thank Amazon for giving me the chance to yak on and on about one of my favorite subjects, even if no one ever reads this.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|Great acting, storyline, and a beautiful message, &#34;Success is measured in how we coupe with disappointmet.&#34;<br />An affirmation to keep in mind and live by.

B004UNX1LS|4.0|Great place to see official music videos.<br /><br />Con- doesn't have everything. Playlists are limited in number of videos to a ridiculously low number.
0439023491|3.0|I fell in love with the world of the first book which is why I purchased this one. While the storyline in this book is still engaging and the book itself a pageturner, the quality of the writing is noticeably worse than the first installment. The storyline begins to feel repetitive and even though there's some pretty crazy twists at the end, you're left feeling not quite satisfied. Although, I guarantee you'll get the third book just to find out what happens next.
B008NW67E0|5.0|Bought this for my son, I like it too ! Music appeals to many generations ! Highly recommended, good driving music.
0439023513|2.0|I bought this book just to find out what happens to the characters. By the time I finished the second book I was very disappointed in the Collins' almost elementary writing style and almost felt ashamed paying for this novel. While the story takes you to a new world from the first two novels and packs pretty surprising twists, ultimately it devolves into Pulp Fiction, leaving the reader wishing they had stopped after the first book.
B009PNQUXO|5.0|Truely enjoy having access to Your Tube while away from my computer. Always entertaining and very very handy to have.
B009RI4FRU|4.0|If you love Wes Anderson or just any delightfully awkward film that takes place in the sixties then this is for you. It is truly amazing and appeals to many. Even though it features young kids it is not appropriate for young kids. It has the PG-13 rate mark... but this is a film that I laughed out loud in, felt awkward watching, but was really glad to have experienced it in the end. A great movie!
B008K8VDPU|4.0|Very fun app that my musical family enjoyed. My sons both play keyboad and it was fun to play with.
B0079R8KXG|5.0|I've had my Kindle Fire since it was launched and until now I've struggled to find a case I liked.  The main thing that caused me to make the switch is that I'm running a rooted Kindle Fire with Jelly Bean and on my old case the notification bar was difficult to get to, not on this case though.  I was a bit hesitant to get a case with a strap as my last one closed magnetically.  But I have to say I don't mind the strap at all, you can tell it's of good quality and its very tight as well.  It's also very good for reading as the case is not to bulky and folds back very nicely.<br /><br />All in all this is a great case that I would definitely recommend, plus it comes in a cool red which is awesome.
B0036OS3F6|4.0|They fit well. I wore them in 20* and they were warm with heavy socks.  I have a very high arch and were still easy to slip on.  They are not as soft to walk on as regular crocs which is the reason I choose them which is why they get only 4 stars.
B006RXQ800|5.0|After watching &#34;Abe&#34;, I wanted to explore more movies starring Daniel Day-Lewis and I was not dissapointed.  Day-Lewis was among other superb actors: Leonardo DiCaprio, Cameron Diaz and Liam Neesom to name a few. The movie was bloody, but told an interesting story of relations between irish immigrants, blacks, and whites who considered themselves &#34;natives&#34; during the mid 1800' in New York City.  This took place specifically during the civil war.

0525953728|5.0|Could not put this down until finished!  U S Navy Seals are amazing!  Highly recommend this book. Just don't get it until you have 2 days all to yourself to read cover to cover.
0316069884|5.0|I ordered this book as a fan of Jonathan Safran Foer's fiction AND as a 22 year vegan.  Between his concise and compassionate writing, and his thoughtful arguments, this is one of the best books I've read on the decision to be concious of what impact our food choices make on the world.  Not a call to vegetarianism per se, as much as a call to awareness--ethically, environmentally, and in the interest of your health and your children's.
B009SQQRH2|5.0|&#34;Arthur Christmas&#34; is the story of the less-favored son of Santa whose generous heart and love of Christmas make him a winner.  The movie should please the whole family with its sweet story, visually appealing animation, accomplished voice work, and many humorous touches.  &#34;Arthur Christmas&#34; has been added to our &#34;must see&#34; list for the holidays.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is soo much fun a great time waster!! the only thing I don't like about it is u have to BUY the hints like what the heck?!?but it is awesome otherwise!!
B007V65R54|2.0|Book is very interesting, but rather slow to read, with way too many sports stories without the techniques actually used. I was expecting something more in depth.
0525953728|5.0|This is simply breathtaking story. It is really unbelievable what the Navy Seals had to go thru to complete their mission. I think everybody should read this book It is awesome.
B009RI4FRU|2.0|Moonrise Kingdom was not interesting to me in any way. It could not keep my attention. I fell asleep out of boredom.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Best show I seen in awhile. Very realistic, Can't wait to see who dies next week. Zombies will rule the world.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|I love hidden object games and this one is good but like I said --for me, just a bit too much going back and forth to many different screens MANY times. I am towards the end and very frustrated with the code on the rocks. I have entered numerous times and cannot figure it out. Tried every variation I can think of. HELP!
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|Rick Riordan writes an amazing third installation of the Olympians series! It may be a little less action-packed than the third Kane Trilogy book, but it keeps moving nicely. There's a romance element in this one, and it's nice to see Greeks and Romans together at last! It's a page-turner that'll keep you going until the last page, and perfect for the pre-teen reluctant reader who needs a solid story line to draw him/her in!
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|It was fun for a while and I love this game in arcades... but after some time it became boring. No true skill is involved. All in all it's just coins falling on a screen.
B005OT2YVA|2.0|I won't say that this movie doesn't have its moments, just that they are few and far between. And you know those horrible, horrible memories everyone grows up with, the kind that scream \\"embarrassment\\" at high volume when, a few years later, you are reminded of the fact that yes, you were stupid enough to say that in front of those people? This movie is chocked full of those moments.
B0098VXBIA|2.0|The cast was great and I got out of it what I thought I would.  Nothing bad to say really.  Had some good laughs but some of it was predictable.
B000ZP7YZY|4.0|So far I like this boot.  After finally getting my size right.  I wear a 15 or 16 size shoe depending on the make.. Normally 16 and I fit loosely into a size 14 (13 was too small) of this boot.  I bought some Dr Shouls inserts and now it feels great.  I would probably need a size 13.5 but they don't make it.  After I replaced the stock inserts, with after markets, they fit great and are pretty comfortable.  Only had them a couple weeks but so good so far.
B008WHTFL8|5.0|This MP3 is loud and raunchy as it should be.<br />The Darkness is one of my favorite bands.<br />Get one of their cds if you can,  you won't be sorry.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|One of the most original novels I've read in years.  I won't rehash the plot.  Die Hard enters the Twilight Zone a la Crichton.
0547884591|5.0|The 4-Hr Chef is awesome!!! Tim Ferris wants you to be an expert at something now. Have you always wanted to spend a year in Japan but figured it would take too long to learn the language? Ever wanted to go on an African Big-Game hunt but got scared when you realized you would have to learn dozens of various skills and sub-skills in order to pull it off? Well, Tim Ferris has the cure to your problem and it is called Meta-Learning.<br /><br />This book is an evolution from the 4HWW and 4HB as it seems to contain the best of both. First, like the 4HWW this book is designed to help you 'choose your own adventure.' It is a model for a better way of life. The format and lay-out of the book is very much like the 4-Hr Body. It is very dense and has a wide range of materials. As the reader, it is up to you to pick and choose the things of most interest. However, unlike the 4HB, this book is jam-packed with full-color photos and visual aids to help you grasp some of the 'heavier' topics.<br /><br />As an avid follower of Tim's, I have always been fascinated with his ability to become good at things and I always figured if I could replicate his learning method, I too would be able to become more of who I wanted to be, do more of what I wanted to do, and just live the good life. Now, thanks to this book, I can follow the same model.<br /><br />P.S.  There are some reviewers who seem to doubt Tim's credibility.  Tim has always said that he is not the expert, he is just the guide and the test subject. He creates models of success that work for him and he shares it with others - that's it - take it or leave it. However, his models seem to be working very well for him. Just look at the guy - he has accomplished so much in such a wide array of things.  Obviously, he is doing something right and you've got to respect him for that. Don't be mad at the guy or seek to tarnish his reputation, just learn as much as you can from him and be thankful someone out there is living the good life for all us sinners.
B004HX4RT6|5.0|Hi, I would recommend anyone of any skill level. There is lots of flexibility for play choices. Not a cheap chess imatation!
B004HW7JH4|4.0|Watching this season again at one sitting, you pick up the clues scattered throughout the season. You also appreciate the thematic threads runnng through each episode. Just sorry Jared Harris won't be back in season six.
1455502758|5.0|Hitchens tells us what it is like to know that you are going to die in the near future and then what it is like to die. This is a brutally honest treatise on death but how it can be handled with dignity in the face of bigotry and prejudice.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|A number of people have already given fairly deep reviews on the plot, acting, atmosphere and action which in truth moved me to give this rental a shot.  Your time is valuable so let me sum up by saying, I was unexpectedly entertained and enjoyed every moment of the movie's story and cinema-photography.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Very good read. Great follow up to first book. Surprise ending. I'm intrigued & can't wait to read the third one!
B00535RV8Q|5.0|I love the simplicity of these songs, yet they have depth and meaning.  What can you say about a legend.
B008GJV4F2|5.0|great movie, love johnny depp, had some trouble with it connecting to the tv with amazon but otherwise great buy
B0000CEB4V|5.0|I orig. seen the Concert on PBS with a ton of interruptions.  I recently purchased the DVD because of the Music and all the Artists that gathered to pay homage to George and his life was amazing.  His Son was on stage playing with all The Artists.  His wife made an Appearance as well.  All the Music/songs played were over the Top with Feeling and purpose.  The purpose of HONOR.  I highly recommend this DVD.<br />Thank You George.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I needed this to run some of the other programs.  Once loaded my programs ran fine.  I have no complaints.
B000AYQJ3I|5.0|George and his Giving Heart is sorely missed.  His music hits home in so many ways.  Another legend, what is there to say.
B005HSL626|5.0|This is a great little game to help the kids pass time while waiting for other things to happen.  Even my three year old can play it.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|I read every single story. This was a huge collection,and such a bargain!!<br />Its amazing that something written so long ago wasn't dated. The lack of DNA or computer help didn't make these solutions any less remarkable.<br />I learned how important it is to notice what percentage of a book I am at. The Kindle Fire is very delicate, advancing to another story could have spoiled my fun. I found bookmarking helpful when I'd stop for the night, or if I lost a character or sentence with a page turning. Arrowing back a page would solve that problem.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|We love the You Version Bible.  So many translations and so many options.  Easy to use and can even be used with plans.
B0016OLC5Q|5.0|I was really hoping he would get out of there. That was a lot to take in. I can not believe someone went through that much pain and just rawness of life. The movie was wonderfully made, with the cast being so perfect for it.
B00076OMW4|5.0|Again, I am pleasantly impressed with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under the direction of Fritz Reiner.  I followed the advice of a previous reviewer as I could not listen to music samples and I'm very glad I did!  The selections move at a magnificant pace and it's obvious that the musicians are outstanding in every way.  The chills were alive in me as I felt like I was sitting before them.  Awesome!
B005NJU8PA|2.0|Again, as with the Atkins cookbook, this is not arranged in an order that makes it easy to use.  Since I got the Kindle edition, it's not like you can flip back and forth through the book.  I got more concise information watching the author on Dr. Oz.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I totally loved this book, I would recommend this book to anyone who loves action with a little love story not just for women but men too. This book deserves five stars one word, AWESOME!
B009HV2JT8|5.0|The idea of this movie is very intoxicating to me.  Satire aside, it was a clever mix of historical fact and vampire fiction that worked very well together.  The ending is one of the best scenes in the entire movie.
0385535147|3.0|Was a nice and quick read, but pretty formulamatic.  The lawyer turned convict turned con man was abit different, but it played out the same.  No regrets tho, and I am hooked on Grisham, so will contine to buy his stuff

B0084I9QI2|5.0|The One and Only KOP!! A must have for any who like and enjoy Michael's music and dancing. The BAD Tour Live at Wembley is amazing. Seeing Michael doing what he did best and being happy is priceless.
B0053JJLLC|3.0|Just wanted to say that a few things are a little too predictable. But it is easy to read and I still want to know what will happen at the end. There is still time for the book to become more \\"suspensional\\" so this is just a in-between opinion. Admittedly though I usually don't find the time to write a review about the book after as I usually have started the next :)
B000SEGUDE|3.0|Hard to follow but everything is tied up in the end even if it doesn't all make sense.  Read it so I would understand the movie better. My favorite sections were the ones dealing with the future. They were the easiest to follow and make sense of.

B009FZFONO|5.0|The interplay between cast members is just getting better and better. You won't be disappointed with Season 3. The Zombies are a side item.  It's the torment of having to deal with the horror that makes this series such a gripping tale.
B0087JTAKW|3.0|Have a couple of hours to slow down and put a little perspective into your life? The Time Keeper can do that... interesting idea with some timeless themes..enjoyable...:-)

B008X9Z4I8|5.0|This is a lightweight, reasonably-priced case for the Kindle Fire.  The color makes it easy to find in a bag.
B00ADIHWKA|5.0|Here's my take on the show:<br /><br />What I've noticed and come to enjoy, the predictable plot progression doesn't happen.  I loved 24 but even that show the outcome was predictable to a point.  That show revolved around Jack Bauer.  Lost revolved around 6 main characters who would always come out on top.  The plot of Lost was full of twists and turns but not like this one.  This show, just when you think you've got it figured out boom a shock wave hits ya.  I wasn't sure at all if I'd like this show.  I watched the first episode from Netflix, I didn't want to spend money on something I was sure wouldn't appeal to me.  I guess I was wrong.  This isn't like a show on vampires.  Trueblood is a great show, but this is completely different.  If you like stories about the end of days, horror/action/drama movies or just plain want to see zombies go for it, you won't be sorry in the least.  One last thing, if you don't like comic books don't try to read the graphic novels.  I don't know about you, but I don't like my books to come with pictures or talking bubbles with less than 100 words per page. The actors portray their parts excellently.  The makeup and costume designers did a fabulous job with this one.  The settings are perfect as well.  It gets you thinking that's for sure.  What if this happens?  How would you deal with an end of days story that included zombies?<br /><br />My complaint is that Amazon makes you pay for the first two seasons which is stupid.  If you go to Netflix you can watch the first two seasons free.  I think that once a T.V. show has completed a season it should be made available for free.  It's just my opinion.  I'm sure the bean counters at Amazon would disagree.
B006OCM0G0|3.0|I love the game, I've been playing for over a year and a half now. My major complaint is with the last update - to get into the game now I have to bypass up to 10 screens of random game spam crap! Just freaking stop - no I don't give a crap about your 'gem sale' that you're having everyday - stop spamming me about every other TL game in the store - I don't want to play your 'goals' leave me alone - great thanks for letting me know a new item is in the store but after I close it out the first time don't show me the freaking add again until tommarow. My biggest issue with the game is actually being able to play the damn game!

B00881PPTO|1.0|Check the play store, the app is always free there. Kayak slapped a price on this app and labeled it Pro just so they could be featured as FAOTD!  This is a one star move from both Kayak and Amazon. Boo to both of you!

B008GM1G70|5.0|Waking Life is a very thought provoking and interesting movie.  I really enjoyed it, and highly recommend it to others!
B000KOZMUE|5.0|I purchased this because of Ken Rockwell's reviews of it.  I have used it a tiny bit and have really liked the results of the pictures so far.  The size is so handy when you just need a little extra light.  The only problem is turning your camera vertically, there's no way of bouncing light off the ceiling.

B0009VSB06|5.0|right off the bat opened the box put it together and walked out into the back yard to fool around with it and in 5 minutes found a old key that was about 4 inches deep and 2 other pieces of metal.  Thats before i read the instructions, I have to say I am impressed. For the price I got 2 the wife watched how easy it is to use and had her out in the back yard too both of us finding metal items, house was built in '59 so I would imagine there is a lot of stuff in my back yard. Got to give this one a A+.
B0083GR6Y6|4.0|The movie was enjoyable to watch! Much suspense. If you enjoyed the movie Frozen you would most certainly enjoy the Grey for sure.
B007FH9GA6|3.0|The story was really slow and then once it was all in motion I don't feel as if the director had a clear understanding of the story.  He didn't seem to tie the story together too well and it didn't seem very realistic.<br /><br />However I did like how the girl with the dragon tattoo put her perverted executor in his place.  She was a powerful little woman.  I liked her.<br /><br />I had trouble understanding the male lead.  He mumbled a lot.<br /><br />That's my take.

B004ZJZPXO|5.0|This movie ties up all loose ends and answers questions from the way-too-shortlived series.  So - I'm glad I have another couple of hours to spend with the Firefly crew/passengers....but still very sad that a series as good as this one didn't last as long as it should have.  Now I own the full series and the &#34;finale&#34; movie....and I wish there were more.
1609611543|5.0|Very interesting, informative book. Apparently wheat is poison. Who knew? I lost fifty pounds before I read the book just by avoiding bread.<br />Then I went back to bread and gained. Then quit again and lost.<br />Then I read 'Wheat Belly' and am finding it much easier to maintain my weight loss.<br />Really works.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I was a Harry Potter fan (not one of those crazy fans) because I loved how the books were so magical, you wished you lived in their world.  I was looking for a similar book or series that would make me feel that same way again, and I found it in The Night Circus.  I loved the ornate descriptions of the tents and the way the story kept changing to give you so much insight into what was going on.  But I will admit that I didn't like the ending.  It was too unbelievable, which is ironic, because the whole book is about making the unbelievable seem believable to the common public.  [SPOILER ALERT]  The ending seemed kind of like, &#34;Well they had to get their happy ending somehow, so let's give it to them and work around it.&#34;  The couple gets to be together and then the story ends as all responsibilities are reassigned to other characters.  Boring!

B0076DELIG|3.0|The free preview and all previous Bosch books had text to speech enabled. Not this one??????<br />Disappointed.  How can we fix this?<br />UPDATE:<br />For those who made negative comments about my posting:<br /><br />- Yes the book is clearly labeled with \\"text to speech disabled\\".  Likewise my review is clearly labeled as a complaint about that problem only.<br /><br />- Yes this is the place for book reviews.  However, Amazon has no other place to complaints like this to be made to them or the publisher, or to warn other buyers who don't know about the disabling.  Their \\"what makes a good review?\\" specifies: \\"What would you have wanted to know before you purchased the product?\\"  Exactly.<br /><br />- Those who made especially obnoxious comments don't think to understand the problems some people with dyslexia have with the written word.  Text to speech is a wonderful and therapeutic feature.  Yes I could buy the Audio Book, but that has many limitations: download time, space hogging, lack of text search, and greater cost since I can't share the book with other family members on the account who have already bought the text version.<br /><br />- All of which makes it very frustrating when publishers disable text to speech without explaining for what conceivable reason they are doing so.<br /><br />Hopefully this has created enough of a stir to get the publisher to think more carefully about his decision.

B004GCPJDQ|5.0|I bought 3 of these about 6 months ago, and they've been working flawlessly. I just bought a 4th one. Reading other reviews , I have one comment to make.<br />If you try to take it out after it has been installed, make sure you push the black latch in the correct direction. Push it towards the edge, not towards in. I struggled with that. You may need a screw driver to push it until it pops out. I never tried to remove it before, until I read some reviews today, and had to go look at a magic mouse that has the original batteries. Oh yeah, don't put it on a metal surface. It won't charge. I also use their track pad charters, and they work great also.
B0091XRPTQ|4.0|My 6 (about to be 7) year old son loved it, my 4 year old daughter did not as the action (especially in the first half of the movie) was too scary for her at times.  I think this was especially so with the realistic look to the animated characters and the many near death sequences.  So parents of young kids (&#60;=5 is my guess) should judge their kid's tolerance for &#34;scary&#34; action scenes before buying/renting.
B005LAIHCM|2.0|[The review refers to the theatrical version of the film.]<br /><br />One good thing about \\"House at the End of the Street\\" is that the thriller stars Jennifer Lawrence, Oscar-nominated for her turn in a 2010 indie drama \\"Winter's Bone.\\" But probably she is better known as Raven / Mystique in the new \\"X-Men\\" franchise and, of course, Katniss Everdeen in \\"The Hunger Games.\\" I don't know what made her choose \\"House,\\" but even the gifted players like Jennifer Lawrence and Elizabeth Shue cannot save the movie from becoming tedious and predictable.<br /><br />Elizabeth Shue and Jennifer Lawrence are Sarah and Elissa, mother and daughter who moved into a small town in Pennsylvania. Sarah and Elissa knew before renting their new spacious house that there was a terrible double murder in a small house in the nearby woods. What they didn't know is that Ryan (Max Thrieriot), who happened to be away from home when the murder took place, is still living there. Elissa is attracted to Ryan, who is a bit strange but seems to be a nice person.<br /><br />But what is more disturbing is the town's \\"urban legend\\": the killer, who is supposed to be dead, may be still alive, lurking somewhere in the wood. And Elissa comes to think that the rumor may be true. Gil Bellows also appears as a local police officer.<br /><br />The film's premise sounds great, like an old-fashioned Hitchcock-like thriller, but the execution is simply not. In short, the suspense-less film is just dull, not knowing how to tell its potentially interesting story - the original story by Jonathan Mostow (\\"Breakdown\\" \\"Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines\\"), screenplay by David Loucka (\\"Dream House\\") - which is ruined by uninspired direction and countless impossible decisions these characters continue to make.<br /><br />Considering the talent involved, \\"House at the End of the Street\\" could have been a more entertaining thriller, had it been made by someone with storytelling skills. As it is, the film is only a bland thriller with a few good ideas and gifted actors sadly wasted.

B0002VFXFE|4.0|There have been so many mixed reviews on this thermal paste that I am starting to think that it doesn't really make a difference if you don't apply it correctly. As far as thermal paste goes, this is high quality, it isn't the best, but it is a good mid-grade overclocking thermal paste that last a long time.<br /><br />How to apply THIS thermal past:<br />1.) Put a half-pea size in the middle. (a little goes a long way)<br />2.) But the heat sink over and twist it back and forth carefully a few mm to cover.<br />At this point you can practice this method by lifting the Heat Sink to see how much you put, if it goes over the edges of the chip, congrats! You just put waaaaayyy too much. Either way, if you are satisfied what how it looks (it doesn't have to be perfect around 70-80% coverage should do), CLEAN OFF AND REAPPLY<br />3.) When attaching heat sink MAKE SURE NOT TO LET IT LIFT OFF. That would creat air pockets, which allow heat.<br />4.) Turn on CPU and overclock it a bit hot to spread evenly for about an hour or so. If it runs hotter than it previously was when idle, you did it wrong.<br />5.) Don't overclock right away, the container says 200 hour set in time. I would say give it a few days, then it should be at 100%.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-It's High Quality Thermal Paste<br />-Lasts a while (both the tube and the compound itself)<br />-15 or so applications tube, depending on what you are using it for<br />-Cheap<br />-lazier method of application<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Not the best of the best<br />-200 hours set in time (over-estimated to ensure potential)<br />-Different application method than most thermal compounds that requires a bit of practice<br /><br />Don't expect to get much results other than a max of ~5C or so. If you do get anywhere near or more than that, you just needed to get some new compound or dusted of the fans/heat sink.<br /><br />I used this for all my CPUs, GPUs, PS3, and XBOX. Works for almost anything based off computer design, but make sure to follow manufacturer's recommendation when possible (may not be great for everything).t make sure to follow manufacturer's recommendation when possible (may not be great for everything).

B008UUPOVM|5.0|I find that on sophomore albums, newly popular artists often fall victim to trying to separate themselves too much from their raw style that first captured their fan base.  They often do so in the attempt to show their versatility and increased maturity as an artist.  Owl City has a thoroughly catchy and upbeat sound that I would dearly miss if they ever broke from it.  In this regard, this album delivers song after song of pure delight that is the trademark upbeat, poetic, vivid imagery, thought invoking music I enjoy so much.

B0085RQLXK|4.0|I felt I had to write this review to counteract some of the very negative reviews. It really is not as bad as some reviews make it out to be, especially after a few listens.<br /><br />I feel expectations from this album have been too high, what with Jack Douglas producing and the hype that it was going to be a throwback to 70's Aerosmith. This is 2012...that was never going to happen. Instead what we have here is what we should have been expecting...a very contemporary sounding Aerosmith record.<br /><br />Much of the criticism is based on the number of ballads and generally the amount of filler. It's really not so bad. Yes there are a lot of ballads, but they are quite decent. In fact the one they released as a single `What Could Have Been Love' I believe would have been a massive hit if released during the Get a Grip era. The other ballads are pretty good, except for the Carrie Underwood duet and maybe `Tell Me'. The chorus of `Tell Me' lets it down....it gets very dreary very quickly. It sounds a bit like a leftover from Nine Lives. And as for the Carrie Underwood duet, it is just so un-Aerosmith and un-rock n roll. It would have made for a very decent Carrie Underwood solo song, but it is not Aerosmith and is definitely a track I could do without. But the rest of the ballads are pretty good including surprisingly the Dianne Warren penned number `We All Fall Down'. Sure, it's a bit cookie cutter, but who cares when it is sung so well by Mr Tyler.<br /><br />The two Joe Perry sung songs really do seem unnecessary, especially the extremely dull `Something'. That's what solo albums are for in my opinion. These two tracks are the only tracks on this album I would describe as pure filler...oh, and the Carrie Underwood duet (in case I have not made it obvious already that I don't like that track!)<br /><br />Now for the good news. What I think more than saves this album is the fact that there are enough Steven Tyler sung up and mid tempo rockers. There are 7 of them in fact, which if we go back to the days when there were 10 or 11 tracks on an album would have been more than sufficient to satisfy fans. All these tracks are at the very least very good, and some are just excellent (e.g. the awesome `Beautiful', which I think should have been the lead single) with plenty of funk and groove that only Aerosmith can produce.<br /><br />Sure, the album would have been much punchier and quality filled from start to finish if they had left off the Perry sung tracks, the Carrie Underwood duet and maybe `Tell Me' to make this an 11 track album, but that's what the skip button is for on music players. It seems a shame to have to use the skip button on an Aerosmith album, but we should be grateful for what we have been given. It is a privilege just to be able to hear THAT voice on some new tracks 40 years on from the start of it all. Yes, 40 years! Come on, they deserve huge credit for that.<br /><br />Anyway, this is just my humble opinion. My message is two-fold...don't listen too much to the negative reviews and don't hold your expectations too high. If you do these things, you will have the pleasure of listening to some great new Aerosmith tracks and it is a such a treat! Overall, I am very satisfied Aerosmith fan. Thanks for reading!

They all gave the same answer and they all have apps that are available and free.<br /><br />The app is fast and consolidates a lot of travel information access and data into one app. It is easier than searching the web for the same data but it generally will not give you the best prices.<br /><br />What I don't like:<br />Like all of the other travel software they ignore the lower priced airlines for example (Southwest) even though they were 16 % less expensive on the airline tickets. Why, they don't get commissions like they do from the bigger airlines.<br /><br />If you are really on a budget then you owe it to yourself to use the web and really shop the best deals on airlines and hotels. These apps want your business; they want to make a commission so why charge for the app and remove the ads?<br /><br />I personally don't want an app that knows where I am and uses my email and reads my calendar and personal confidential data.<br /><br />Summary:<br />It knows where you are using GPS, sends unknown emails using your account, reads your calendar and personal confidential information. What else do you want to know? Go to the web using the web site and you don't have to share all of this.

B0041KVW2K|3.0|Yeah, so I have a $600 record cleaner (nitty gritty).  My original justification was that this would be great for my growing used vinyl collection.  Realistically, new vinyl needs it as much, if not more.  Is it crazy that these records are no fun to listen to without a cleaning?  Yes, but I think they are being held to an unrealistic standard for $22-a-pop LPs.<br /><br />These records were loaded with visible gunk.  My Abbey Road and White Album were full of pops an noise.  Side two of Abby Road looked like apple juice ran down the side of it.  One pass through the nitty gritty and they were sounding near perfect.  Generally I would make this my first step, but I wanted to A/B because I'm crazy like that.  So far I have not run into any serious misalignment or warping.  Just the usual stuff.<br /><br />As a young fan of The Beatles and vinyl, I am very excited by this collection.  For me vinyl is as much about the experience of playing as it is about the sound quality.  With most of my used vinyl copies of The Beatles albums being thoroughly warn, its great to get my hands on virgin and relatively sturdy 180-gram vinyl.<br /><br />I won't debate the merits of digital vs analog.  I have high end gear for each and enjoy each for critical listening.  I rather liked the FLAC version of this collection released a few years back and this release does not disappoint.  Although it feels a bit lame to create a vinyl kit off of 24-bit digital sources, I'm sure they are working with much higher-end analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog equipment when making these records than we are when listening to CDs or FLAC files.  Besides, its irrelevant, the result is fantastic.<br /><br />So, in short I think this is the best sounding vinyl from The Beatles you will find right now.  The used stuff is used.  The only reason people are selling it is because its worn out.  I'm taking off one star for the insane amount of gunk on these records and for the fact that I think they could have used higher quality vinyl (see recent Hendrix and Nirvana rereleases or any of the record store day 45s from The Black Keys--you could use these records for a coffee table top).<br /><br />* One thing worth noting is that I ordered my set from Music Direct and it came boxed inside a very thick cardboard box with a custom foam insert.  It arrived in flawless condition.<br /><br />UPDATE 01/13/13<br /><br />OK, I'm going to relent a bit and knock this down to a 3-star.  I've listened to every album 3 or 4 times at this point and there are some pressing issues.  I've gone over my whole set with a fine-toothed comb and will say several albums are very poor quality pressings.  No amount of cleaning will fix them up.  I've played on a few carts ranging from $200 - $1200 and a few phono pres ranging from $300 - $1200.  I've also listened through b&w speakers and grado headphones.  In all cases my RB301 tonearm was used.  Each combo had slightly different results with some being more revealing of the noise than others.<br /><br />In addition to some noise, there are also some odd pressing issues.  I have 2 sides in the kit that are off center.  SPLHCB sounds pretty good, but the vinyl is very uneven (2.6 mm on one side and 1.15 mm on the other).  Odd texture/roughness around entry grooves:  on my third listen to MMT the needle skipped from the entry groove well into the first song (the shelter 501 is not the best tracker, but that's pretty nuts).<br /><br />There are some pieces of vinyl here I'd rate 5 out of 5:<br /><br />Revolver<br />Abbey Road<br />Rubber Soul<br />Help!<br />The Beatles For Sale<br /><br />There is quite a long (13) threads on SteveHoffman about this and a lot of bad reviews here, so I can imagine there are some truly horrid box sets out there.  The best recommendation I've read is to purchase the EU box set from amazon UK.  Especially if you have a process to flatten warped records.<br /><br />I am going to contact EMI/Capitol to initiate an exchange on my bad records and hedge by ordering them all individually from the EU along with a few of my favs for comparison.

B00991TCOG|5.0|This quirky young woman is amazing. Her music is a delight to the soul. I think her YouTube videos, where i leaned of her, demonstrate her true showomanship. Thus, I bought the album to support one of my favorite artists.
6304711905|5.0|ANOTHER ACTION PACK....IT WAS ALSO A GOOD MOVIE HOW BROTHER AND FAMILY SHOULD STICK TOGETHER...BECAUSE BLOOD IS THICKER THAN WATER
B00AA7O22U|4.0|A lot of explosions, fighting, etc.  It was funny and enjoyable to watch.  Good cast and an okay story line.
0767812387|5.0|THIS MOVIE WAS ABOUT SOME ONE HAD TO PROVE THEMSELVES ......ONE THOUGHT THAY WERE BETTER THAN THE OTHER ....HE HAD TO PROVE HIMSELF
B000TGXT0S|5.0|Everything is awesome on this album, guitar, bass, drums.  Even the vocals are solid.  The speed and imagination on the solos is just great.
B009157BWU|5.0|This movie was great.  Not a whole lot of action but I like how they name and personalize the &#34;star&#34; chimps.  Amazing footage I can't believe they were able to film this.
B005BV0BA2|4.0|This is a solid concept album with a bit more keyboard than I would like but still quite heavy.  All the rest of the boys are in great form including awesome vocals from Bruce.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is my favorite game EVER!!!! i multiplay with my friends and make awesome worlds!!!! i completely reccomend this game for everyone!!!
B005938CS0|5.0|Maiden's start is awesome .  It is a great sense of raw aggression with a few quite interludes that then explode into fast and furious metal.
1451695195|4.0|I didn't think that there was enough specific information in this book about Heaven.  He talked about his coma a lot.
B008KE3960|4.0|Mindless fun. Smooth operation. Rapid advancement, even for all &#34;thumbs&#34; coordinated guys like me. And it's free! What's not to like?
B0027MJU00|3.0|In the two Gillian Flynn books I've read, this and Gone Girl...I was totally absorbed in the fast moving story and the craft in which the story was spun...then in both cases...the book ended. Not well, not creatively or not even tying up loose strings. It just ended and not a lot resolved. Sorry but I like not just happy ending..but I do like &#34;endings&#34;
B000FC1192|5.0|Neil Gaiman wrote a wonderful and strangely inspiring book, good for most ages (assuming the reader can actually read). This book mixes a touch of insanity with a touch of adventure, not unlike \\"Alice in Wonderland\\". On a final note, I will no longer feel a desire to strangle the next cat I see.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I was so excited to read about these 2 and to find out how they handled what life threw at them!  LOVED it and can't wait to read the next one!
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I googled an Oregon Trail game that I could either play in-browser, or on my device, and this app is what popped up.  So I downloaded it...  It's not so much the Oregon Trail that I grew up with and was expecting.  It's more of a Zynga style game, reminiscent of Frontierville or Farmville.  If that's your type of game, then you may enjoy this.  However if you're looking for an Oregon Trail game that you may have grown up playing on your computer... look elsewhere.  This is not it.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Malcolm Bannister is quite a patient and clever character who spends time in prison plotting his release.  Due to the fact that this book is such a fascinating story, I didn't get any housework accomplished for a solid day!  Grisham's story is full of detail which makes the story so fascinating, character development so &#34;visual&#34; and a plot that was not in the least predictable.
B001KP2J3U|5.0|Great movie great stars. Love Agatha Christie movies and books. Maggie Smith is devine! Bette Davis is timeless and ageless. Even though she hated working with Peter.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Nelson DeMille is such a fabulous story teller.  John Corey is the smartest wise ass around who demonstrates his wit and sick sense of humor in this story of terrorism, revenge and adventure in the most horrid conditions and environment that our military must endure.
1419705849|5.0|Perfect condition for a great price.  My kids were very happy to get the latest version of this great series.
B006YXTRHY|3.0|The acting is getting better.  Not as much teen angst  as the last few movies.  I was actually able to enjoy the story line.  I'm looking forward to part 2.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I have this app on both of my tablets.  They have helped keeping me occupied on boring flights and have provided many hours of enjoyment.
B0052GVGYG|5.0|Fantastic album - it's like the Allman Brothers Band with Susan Tedeschi as the lead singer. It's definitely worth it.
B009SJ3GUK|3.0|This season is rather graphic and gross. Very different from season one. I expected it to be a similar feel as the first season, very disappointed.  With the first season I could hardly wait until the next week, and I was trying to figure out what was going to happen all week. This one is more about butchering people, none of that in the first season. I preferred the haunted, thriller feel of the first season. Very much a let down this time!
B004TN7QPG|5.0|I love my Moon Reader.  It evolutionize the reading experience totally!  The only thing is I would like to be able to customize what dictionary I use for word look up.  Somehow I cant install the required color dictionary on my Supernova.  So this would help.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This is a very complete battery monitoring app with a great and simple interface that offers useful information about device power
0547884591|4.0|I'm the first to admit... I'm not a cook.  I hate cooking, I despise following directions (I guess it's my ADD),  I always f**up ingredients or don't have them and most of all I hate cleanup.  If you can relate then buy this book...!<br /><br />Although I would NOT recommend the Kindle version for a couple reasons.  1)  There are many parts and recipes that I would like to refer back to and its just not easy to do with thousands of pages.  2) There is a great chapter about Survival and how to cook under extreme circumstances, such as; Which plants are edible, how to eat wild animals, how to build a sick debris hut.  So Buy the Print edition.<br /><br />Overall this book isn't about just cooking.  It's about learning to do anything that you thought you weren't good at.  It's about using the 80/20 rule everything that you do.  It forces you out of your \\"comfort\\" zone.  There was a very smart person who once said:  \\"Life begins at the edge of your comfort zone\\".  Its good to go there and do new things... Tim Ferriss helps the \\"non-doers\\" learn anything..
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Read the book when I heard the movie was coming out. Absolutely phenomenal and inspirational read. Such a positive read with a great ending
B007TXN4TK|3.0|Sometimes there was no sound and I know it's just an app but it's hard to play the keyboard, nothing like a regular piano.
B005OP2928|5.0|This season certainly doesn't disappoint. There are few sitcoms that make you laugh out loud.<br />I continue to really enjoy this series.
B001BZRUR4|4.0|This was a really great book for me. I loved every bit of it. Ed was very easy to relate to, and I loved how he dealt with problems that are so everyday we don't even think of them. It was perfect for me and just what I needed.
B0047WJ12K|2.0|This movie was pretty difficult to follow although it was well made.  It was hard to follow the plot without knowing the details ahead of time but might be better if you knew the story line prior to watching it.
B009HEN7LY|4.0|Watched it with the kids and we all enjoyed. Not the best story line but the general movie was so intertwining that you could see past that.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|I enjoyed Prometheus but it doesn't have the power or suspense of Alien. It could also use more character development.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Loved the fantasy world. Only weakness is the ending. The author just kept on expanding the illusion further with rich description.
141659521X|4.0|The Last Man - Vince Flynn - Always a great read! Once you've started hard to quit. I've read all of &#34;Mitch Rapps&#34; series ad have neve been dissapointed.
B007EECSFA|4.0|Great plot.  I didn't figure it out till the end which is unusal for me.  The transition from present to past was pretty smooth.
B0099G6Q5E|5.0|I love this soundtrack! I listen to it almost every day! I was a little disappointed with the riff off when they added voices to Becca's solo but other than that I love it!
B00A77II0U|1.0|objects you add to inventory disappear and become unusable.  you're also not allowed to visit a place a second time to re-search.
B0012NVGHU|4.0|The music was really good, but I was disappointed in the ending! :(  There was obvious chemistry between the actors!
B000FC1RCI|5.0|I read this because my son's class was reading it for English - Loved it!  It is very well written and keeps you guessing until the end.
B009GEEMLY|3.0|Great effects and amazing dialogue and chemistry between the cast. If you are a fan of comics and all lovey-dovey for Joss Whedon then this will put the starch in your trousers.<br /><br />I felt the story was a bit slipshod. They shouldn't require you to watch 10 hours or other films just to have the proper investment in the characters of this one. I am still impressed with it though because I never thought Hollywood would be make a film that would capture the scale of the 1990s Marvel comics Mega cross-overs.<br /><br />Watched via Amazon Instant Video; Excellent Quality, I will use the service again for sure.
B001NLKT60|5.0|It took me a little while to get into the book but when I got past all of the language that was hard to read, I found a gem.  I love all of the characters.  I am reading the second book in the trilogy now and it is awesome as well.
B005BRS8Z6|4.0|This book is an excellent read for all ages.<br />Purchased this for my spouse going through a crisis. The author's perspective is great.<br />The author is a little repetitive, but it is necessary considering the information
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Tried to down load this app many times but to no joy just will not work on my tablet with Ice cream sandwich
0938045695|1.0|Here are 3 HUGE inaccuracies that can be found in Dragon Door publications relating to kettlebells.<br /><br />1. Calories Burned<br /><br />DD books claim you can burn 1200 calories in an hour using kettlebells.<br /><br />Calories Burned with Kettlebells<br />A metabolic equivalent (MET) indicates the rate of calories burned during physical activity compared to the rate at which you burn calories at rest, which has a MET level of 1, according to the Compendium of Physical Activities. Each MET represents 1 calorie per kg per hour. Circuit training with kettlebells has a MET value of 8, which means that an individual who weighs 70 kg, or 154 lbs, burns 560 calories per hour. This figure assumes minimal rest between kettlebell exercises.<br /><br />2. KB's are Russian<br />No, they are not. In fact, they originated in the Highlands of Scotland.<br /><br />3. The Old-Time Strongmen Trained With Kettlebells<br />They were only used to pose for sculptors. Strongmen made a good portion of their wages posing for artists, and the KB was a good way to show off their strength for a pose.<br /><br />I give this book 1 star for being so full of bs. Honestly you can get a better workout from jump rope (~800 cal/hr vs 560)!<br /><br />If you're still dead set on kettlebells I would recommend the book Kettlebell RX. It does a much better job of showing each step of an exercise, and does not come with any propaganda.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Great book! Read it while on Kauai over Thanksgiving holiday.  This book had some real twists in it, I was surprised with the direction it took. Maybe not as good as some of John Grisham's books but I enjoyed it!
B009HV2JT8|3.0|I guess it's entertaining for the price - I'm glad amazon has good prices for their movies on demand - just in case the movies are not that great.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The author Gillian Flynn tells this dark story by alternating first-person accounts from Amy and Nick, the couple whose marital bliss is unraveling. What you'll find within their sides of the story will astound readers who will roll over, look at their mate and wonder &#34;Who are you, really?&#34;<br /><br />To be honest, I don't know why it's on the best sellers list for so long. I kept reading and reading hoping something was going to happen that would seal the deal. I finished the book but really wondered why I kept reading...
1439153663|1.0|This was one of the bleakest books I've read in a long time -- child molestation, beatings, lynching, rapes, incest, opium addition, hateful marriage, families destroyed, missed opportunity for happiness, etc.  And it wasn't even well-written.  It is like a bad romance novel without the romance.  Just terrible.
B00773YOB4|5.0|The first cut I heard months back was the Gerry Rafferty &#34;Right Down the Line&#34; tune. After that, the rest was easy
B0098460O4|5.0|These two have a touching story, and are incredibly talented. This album is beautiful even if you don't usually listen to this sort of music. And if you do, it's a must-have. Mad love for these guys.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|what a great story!!  john grisham kept me on the edge of my seat waiting to see what would happen next.
B00A7ZWUJC|4.0|love it, didnt expect it to be this good. thought it was going to be a \\"rushed\\" album but its so much more than that. highly pleased.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|I would recommend it specially for little girl.  She has three movie elated to this one and my grandchild watch them over and over again.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|Macho smart aleck John Corey gets to be a bit too much and therefore unbelievable in this one ... plus the interesting tidbits about the country and the people are all dumped into boring monologues that remove the interesting-ness of the info.  A tedious read at best.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I payed for the game and the third world and now I cant stop playing it. I haven't slept or eaten in about a week in fact I'm playing it right now on my friend's kindle but I can't get the main theme out of my head. SKQUAK!
B0053O89XI|5.0|My package came very quickly and was in perfect condition when I got it. Big Bang is hilarious and I will be watching these episodes over and over again! The ultraviolet digital copy is really weird because you cannot actually download the episodes and do what you want with them. You download them to an ultraviolet client and watch them within the client.
0345803485|1.0|This book is definitely NOT worth reading. The characters are absolutely non-believable, the protagonist pissed me off (I know she's supposed to be like all clumsy-shy-librarian, but she is a weak character who I can't relate to). There is no story besides this dysfunctional relationship and EVEN THE SEX SCENES are badly written, like the author was 16 years old. There's just too much repetition of words, actions and expressions. And what the hell is about this \\"subconscious\\" and \\"inner goddess\\"? Its so lame, so stupid. Im 21 years old. Anastasia is 12.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|So far these seem complete with minimal errors in type. Great price for all these works. I am excited to get through the entry series.
B0090YHSFC|5.0|My great grandson loves this game and plays it all the time.  both of us are happy with it.  Glad we purchased it.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|thanks for the fun game! keep up all the good work. maby give us another way to earn energy faster.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|keeps a 4 year old very busy.  He taught Grandma how to do it! Easy enough for a 4 year old...hard enough for a grandma.
B009NPA3MS|5.0|Phillip Phillips has begun to make his mark in the music industry when he won Idol, now he is establishing himself as a promising singer songwriter who is in for the long haul.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Highly customizable, can save patterns, adjust sound level for each sound &amp; combine 10 sounds.  I don't hear obvious loops &amp; even the free version has four screens of noticeably different sounds.  I've got one combo saved that really works for me, but I enjoy just playing with the sounds too.
6305972591|3.0|As a huge fan of Stephen King, I love anything I can read, listen to or watch, with only a few exceptions. If he won't put his name on something, I'll skip it. It's research I don't mind doing. Every sequel to this movie is in that category.
0743497465|1.0|I hated this book so much that I am willing to go to any site and review it, all in hopes that another unsuspecting soul won't have to endure this terrible,terrible book.<br />I somewhat enjoyed \\"The Lost Symbol\\" and the \\"Da Vinci Code\\". Although not masterpieces, these books at least kept me interesting...<br />This one, however- I wanted to shoot myself. Terrible plot. Terrible, whiny, unbelievable, stupid characters. Nothing- and I mean, nothing about this book was good. Waste of time.
B009CPES4I|5.0|Great cast and some really fun lines in it - but poignant as well. the story line was fun and characters were likable!
9707704667|5.0|An amazing read! I truly enjoyed it, I suffered through it, along with the author. It is an amazing book, and definitely on my re-reading list! It's much better if you read it in Spanish, if you can.
B009RI4FRU|1.0|The only thing I enjoyed was the location shots - since much of it was filmed in Rhode Island - not new Zealand!! The plot was ridiculis and not even funny. I was so glad when it was finally over!
B00125JP1C|5.0|If you like action and guns more than a deep plot this movie is for you. My favorite scene is delivering a baby in the middle of a gun fight.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Couldn't put the book down from the moment I started reading it. An amazing story and a MUST read. :) DJ
098478280X|4.0|New version has lots of differences than the previous version.<br />but the code is written in Java. Hope there will be a c/c++version coming soon.
B0063GORYU|5.0|My sister always played Spider, and one day I tried it, and now I can't put it down. Love this game.  I will play until I win.
1580084621|3.0|Too much information.  I was expecting a cook book.<br />Calls for exotic ingredients.  Should have recommended substitutes. Doesn't describe the few dishes most familiar to me, Pad Thai for example.
B0000DZ3EN|5.0|This is actually almost as old as the original and was part of the series of OZ films that the author wrote but that most people have never even heard of. Wizard of OZ was not his only book and this is the continuation. Too bad the original cast did not do this one too however.
0525958002|5.0|The book came very fast and it was a great read. Essential reading material for any true Duran Duran fan!
B0051QK87S|5.0|This is by far one of Gaga's best albums. Of course all of her songs are disco best songs (I dont care what you say this is disco) and not as offensive as some of her earlier works.
B004SBX112|5.0|This game is fun to play and has lots of levels to complete. New level is called the Haunted Hogs.
B004XQO90O|5.0|Jake Gyllenhaal is worth looking at all day long and then when you put him in an action movie like this, you get a winning combination.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|This game has  characters that came from star wars characters, pigs included....it has 5 levels and is as fun to play as the other Angry Bird games.
B005IZLPKQ|3.0|I was excited to get this DVD and was disapointed in the end. Chris Evans is hot as is Richard Armitage but they dont let them do what they do best. I think this movie needed a better director because he directed this one in to boredom.
B00A12VW86|5.0|Another GREAT album from the guys!  Ummm I don't know what to say about the download... it was clear lol.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|There are so many games in here that it is distracting. You also may be asked to fork out some money if you want to play all of them games to their fullest capability.
B004DI7HZ6|1.0|I have just started reading this book and so far I can't figure out why the author wrote it yet. For me, this book has been difficulte to get into.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|well written and very readable historical fiction about the lead up and World War One period as seen by families from Wales, Germany, and Russia.
B003TSEL7S|4.0|The book was well written and the plot was interesting but I should have started with The Lighting Thief and read down to this one. I didn't see the point of Percy Jackson or how he tied in to the plot. That is why I didnt give this book a 5 star rating. I did like the book well enough that now I want to read the first book and reread this one.<br /><br />I also thought that this was an adult fantasy book so I was a bit disappointed that it wasn't. However, The book had a great plot and a lot of action and adventure and a (tiny) bit of romance. I wish they had had a series like this when I was a teen 20 years ago. I might have been better in school If I was assigned something worth reading instead of the Old Man and the Sea and The Time Machine.
B009OYTAL8|3.0|This is a fantastic episode, and we enjoyed it most of the way through, but it took us half an hour to watch the last three minutes because the download became so slow.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I am a fan of action movies, and this movie moved along just fast enough to never be boring, and slow enough you got to enjoy the plot, along with the stuff going BOOM! Loved the soundtrack as well.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I would recommend this series to anyone who like adventure, and romance, such a great series. The only downfall is the foul language.
0345803485|2.0|had to have this because of all the hype and was disappointed with it...dont know what I expected but this wasnt it
B009LXEBD4|4.0|I'll start with the positive. I enjoy most of the singles on the album. Don't Rush is a great song, and I very much enjoy People Like Us as well. Even Catch My Breath has grown on me. Kelly is an amazing singer who can sing many genres very well, and it shows with this album.<br /><br />The only problem I have is a few of the singles. Ideally Addicted, Alone, Gone, I Forgive You, and Let Me Down would have been singles, and at least 4 of them would have been on this album. Mr. Know It All and Walk Away would not have been singles. A Moment Like This and I'll Be Home For Christmas would be left off as well. Focus primarily on Kelly's pop singles. It would have made for a more cohesive album and could have been a very, very good Greatest Hits album. As it is, I still enjoy the album and it has my recommendation.
0345803493|1.0|I never read this one.....didnt like the first one so didnt see any point in reading more of the same...not my cup of tea
B009WJ44KC|5.0|I have always been a fan of John Williams, and I had heard a lot of good things concerning this album. After seeing the movie, the music was used very subtly, and I definitely wanted to hear more. The album is great, and a fantastic addition to any John Williams collection.
0345803507|1.0|didnt read this book....didnt like the first one so didnt go on to the rest...many more books to choose from
B009EAO38C|4.0|The videos on YouTube for any of the pieces within the Album is a factor for me to order this album.<br />Great videos!
B00910Y1OQ|3.0|This is a good trick game.  When you reach level Greece number 7, it quits and goes all the way back to the beginning.  FRUSTRATING TO SAY THE LEAST.  DONT WASTE YOUR TIME!!!
B0033VUH6A|4.0|I found this movie riveting and thought provoking.  I waited a long time to be able to rent it online and I feel like I've already seen drama that emulates the style.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I read 50 Shades series too.... I feel this series is less sexually aggressive. The book is suck you in...  can't wait for the next release!
B002N7CTKM|5.0|Community is not a show going to be your favorite show if you like conventional sitcoms. Community continues to push the envelope while constantly throwing in pop culture throughout the show.<br /><br />Troy and Abed in the morning!
B00846REIS|5.0|I read 50 shades series. I feel this is less sexually aggressive. I can't wait for the next release :)
B007QPFGJW|5.0|The Harry Hole series is the first book series I have read out of order.  Even with that fact each book is well written/translated. With Phantom Nesbo had me in the dark until the end of the book again and has me waiting for the next installment the Hole series.
B0063M22QO|4.0|The game itself is fun, and this edition is easy to play.<br />I'd like it to be easier to change the appearance of the tiles and the difficulty of the game--so far, I've missed the instructions.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This is the best app. I've downloaded! when I lay down to go to sleep at night my brain wont shut off but with this and the right mix of sounds it does the trick. I quit thinking about the stresses of life and it takes me to my happy place. Insomniac no more. if I do wake up in the. middle of the night I can fall right back to sleep, if it has already turned off its very simple to turn back on even if you're not fully awake  it also drowns out my dog and boyfriend snoring.  This is a must download!  Beautiful sounds and mixes.
B004Q9TYWQ|5.0|This book was great fun and a quick read.  Terrified of my auto correct feature now.  I laughed constantly until my husband thought I was nuts.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|What more is there to say? The Walking Dead is a staple for any DVD cabinet. Watch, enjoy, and learn!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I am a big Facebook user and spend a lot of time on it. When I got my Kindle Fire HD 8.9, I was excited that the Facebook app was available. If it hadn't been, I wouldn't have bought the device. It was easy to download, but it does not work well on the device. The app does not load all the way and only one page of updates is available. Usually, on other devices, I can continuously scroll to older updates in my news feed, but when I reach the bottom of the screen, the loading icon shows and the app just stays like that without loading any more content.<br />Another problem with the app is that when I click \\"like\\" on a friend's post, the like button gets chosen and then it un-chooses itself and goes back.<br />The last problem is that photos posted by friends are only shown in a partial box and opening them up is slow.<br />Because of all these problems, I'll likely only use the mobile site on the Kindle Fire HD and will not use this app.<br /><br />New update 1/11/13<br />The app has been fixed. The size issues, scrolling issues and \\"like\\" features have all been fixed!
B0088X7YU0|5.0|... You will like this one too. I'm a sci-fi nut, so it's hard to displease me. (Okay, even I didn't like Two-Headed Shark Attack. I do have minimum requirements!). This was a good story though, as good as the first movie. You will see the heros from the 1st movie too, all of them! It is entirely CGI, like the FInal Fantasy movie, but I love that stuff. We enjoyed this here at our house!
B001AGXEAG|4.0|This is just a fun movie to watch.  Heck, the whole cast is great in this movie, and the music is great.
030758836X|1.0|One of the worst books I read...not one redeeming character! Bad plot... Wish I would not have believed the reviews...
B00003CXCS|5.0|This is still one of my all-time favorite movies! The music and the scenery are supurb! All people of all ages need to see this film at least one time. I have seen it more than 20 times since it came out. Homer
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|I recomend this movie to all s f fans. It has great special effects, especially in three dee. Good flick.
B005NJU8PA|1.0|Tim is an energetic, inspirational and most of all promotional character. 4HWW was a really good book because it broke out of the box and helped people to do the same.<br /><br />The success of that and 4HB seems to have pushed Tim and his team beyond the virtue of being good and into the trap of using tools like waves of fake five star reviews and other \\"stunts\\" to be what this is about - more so than the content.<br /><br />We need another 100 one star reviews here just to balance out the fake ones and end up with the three-ish stars this book probably deserves.
081297381X|4.0|The distribution of review rankings looks positively Gaussian, but this might contradict one of the books central tenets.  Therefore, I'll frame my review in the author's vernacular.  I predict that the average intellectual will enjoy reading this book, because it's okay to be a \\"fool in small things.\\"  However, I would not recommend that one take this as gospel and radically change your investment profile.  Be skeptical of the \\"Highly Probable\\" event that this book is totally wrong, impractical about predicting future events or just one more viewpoint that is partially true.  Remember the parable about building your house on the sand versus a rock.  If the rock is Truth about life, then sand is just little bits truth and one would be wise to avoid building on such a foundation.  All that said, I did enjoy reading this book and found it entertaining.  It was worth my time and I learned more than I do from most books, hence my above average rating.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Great game. It was hard at first, then became easier, then when I got into world 4 it got harder. Awesome game.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I still have not had the chance to try out the 7.1 channel because my windows laptop is on its way in the mail. But trying these things out on my brothers mac already tells me im going to love these things. VERY VERY comfortable headset. One of the most comfortable ive tried on and i will say that i have put on ALOT of gaming headsets. The wireless is EXTREMLY clear with the 40 ft distance no lag promised and true. I easily walk out of my room and go to the bathroom or kitchen and still listening to the music perfectly. and thats about 2 or 3 walls seperating it also. I cannot say about battery life or 7.1 chanell or programmable keys yet. but so far im loving it. will get back to this review soon as i try out alll the features
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Another great book by Nicholas Sparks. I wasnt really surprised by anything it was pretty predictable but i still loved it.
B00992CF6W|3.0|The game is almost perfect.....  When I try to search for a network game and join it takes forever and I haven't even got a chance to play one. There should be a tutorial or some objectives to play the game to even start off.
1878424114|5.0|The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success<br />THis book is simple but practical.  It resonates with simplicity and truth.  I am incorporating all these principles as the guidelines for conducting my life.
B009VLXMJA|3.0|I have bought all of Taylor's albums.  This is probably my least favorite.  I still like it, but I feel like it is not as good as her other albums.  It has less meaningful songs on it and the music is very different too.
0547884591|5.0|Tim did it again.  Another great book (and beautiful too).  Since it arrived last week, my daughter (13), wife and I have had our noses in it almost non-stop.  Easy to just pick up, open, and start reading.  Tons of hacks, useful info, and simple understandable insights.  Would definitely recommend, and that's coming from someone who has drastically reduced the number of books in his household over the last year.
B008QTV3X0|4.0|Homelands is a high intensity series. It is thrilling and keeps you on your toes trying to figure out what comes in the next episode. I would have given this a five star but the streamlining was not working well through Amazon on a few episodes. Tried to contact but no where to give complaint. Hopefully next time no issues..
1905236042|5.0|I use my Yoga Pretzels deck in a class I teach for 6-12 year olds.  The cards themselves are nice and sturdy and the illustrations are bright and colorful!<br /><br />I let students pick a pose card from the deck and we all learn the pose together.  The games in the deck are great and I like to end each class with one of the \\"breathe\\" and \\"time in\\" cards.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|loved it read all three books they were talking about it on the radio station i listen to and my peers would talk about it.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|I have tried downloading the app twice and it won't open. Fix the app and I will give more stars.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|loved it read all three books they were talking about it on the radio station i listen to and my peers would talk about it.
B007M45PMU|5.0|Besides the big hit this album is really fun and amazing. They do a nice job of balancing fun loving and meloncoly
B007IXWL2C|5.0|loved it read all three books they were talking about it on the radio station i listen to and my peers would talk about it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great episode!<br /><br />I put this show on my danger to stop watching list  after the slowness of season 2, but season 3 has been a delight so far. They keep pushing the action so something is happening every episode and they've toned back the relationship things just enough to find a perfect blend that other AMC shows seem to have.
6302468027|5.0|I have  loved this movie every since it came out. It all comes together in the end an inspiring friendship, love and hope for all. You will love it too.
B005VPRETE|5.0|Our daughter has logged many hours playing with her legos- this was the perfect companion piece for her collection.  So happy there is now 'legos for girls!&#34;
B009FZFONO|5.0|I can't believe that Season 3 is even better than the first two seasons but it is...can't wait for more episodes!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Addictive. and entertaining I have enjoyed using it since the moment I downloaded.  learned I can go back and can edit.
B007KDFWRG|5.0|I loved the Derek Trucks Band and I love this new band too. This is soul-shaking music and I can't get enough.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Awesome game for whole family.  Over Thanksgiving whole family from ages 9 to 70 played.  We were having contests to see who could get the farthest in a certain time frame.
B009329ZF2|3.0|The overall premise of the movie is obviously far fetched. But even accepting that, the general plot line of the movie is poorly developed.  However, if all you are looking for is lots of action with Navy ships, then it might be worth watching.
0345803485|5.0|I'd give it 1000 stars if I could! I've never been able to just read a book, i'm not a reader at all! But this book is so interesting and you can actually see what the characters are doing as you read it. I know it's an exotic book but it is so well written with such great interesting detail. It has kept me so interested and I can't wait to read the other 2 books!!! I recommend that all adults read this book, it's fantastic!
1609611543|5.0|Really enjoyed this book, especially the recipes. Very thorough and sound diet advice that doesn't feel like a diet.  Highly recommend.
0385344228|5.0|A teenager is accused of murder and the impact this has on the family - I could not put it down ..
B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|This thoughtful book is a must read for anyone involved with children: parents, teachers, grandparents.<br />I believe it has breakthrough strategies.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Love this.  Easy to use.  Makes organizing my photos so easy.  Great delivery.  Excellent price.  I would definitely buy more of these if I needed them.
B008CPBB0I|5.0|I have been waiting a while to see this and enjoyed every moment- GREAT family film  to see for sure:-).
B000URWYTS|5.0|Absolutely loved this book.  I had no idea about Frank Lloyd Wright's life.  I had a really hard time putting this down.  Story really draws the reader in.  Mr. Wright certainly had an interesting life.  Highly recommend this.
B0011XBLUS|5.0|Itz an age old classic. I loved it when I was a kid growing up on Westerns and I still love it today.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I have read almost every book by Nicolas Sparks.  He didn't disappoint me with this book.  As with his other books, I found it hard to put this down.  Light reading but very entertaining.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|it's a great CD, and for 99 cents, you can't beat it. it's actually a great CD - usually CDs have 2 to 3 good songs, this one has 11.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Couldn't put this down.  Loved all 3 books.  Very strange, but intriguing.  Ending almost seems unbelievable.  Would recommend this to everyone.
B00338QENI|5.0|This is a compelling story about both a family's history and a medical miracle that should be more well known in America. Much can be learned when we know as a society how many medical advances have been made possible because of this one woman's cells. It is absoutely amazing!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Love this.  Easy to use.  Makes organizing my photos so easy.  Great delivery.  Excellent price.  I would definitely buy more of these if I needed them.  Defintiely for mature audience.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|very helpful for those of us with ADD and/or memory issues and/or organizational issues. helped very much with gathering info for our trip!
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is fun to play alone.  Often I can win.  Like that if I can't win the first time, I can retry.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|A terrific read for everyone who feels rushed, pushed, and prodded through life at breakneck speed!  Once again, Mitch Albom touches another of modern humanity's dilemmas with deep insightfulness. I read his books over and over, and appreciate their content more with each read.  Another winner.
0525952926|5.0|The second volume of this trilogy lives up to the promise of the first, leading the reader through another generation of 6 related families making their way through WWII in five countries.  The epic series is every bit a match for Michener, with perhaps even deeper dives into humanity.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|The first half or more of this first-hand account was great and moved along quickly.  I'm certain that no words are adequate to describe such a momentous experience, but more words don't change that fact.  The plug for the foundation at the end was a real turn-off.
B0059XTTW8|5.0|Great adaptation of one of LeCarre's best books.  Some at our viewing found it hard to follow, but that's part of the charm.  Be prepared for time warps and skipping around, but doing so is actually key to geting the story told with suspense and intrigue.  Worth buying and spending some time with.
B009CG2YDE|4.0|I was hesitant at first but this app is actually good. Simple graphics and play but still fun. Dont have an opinionbon the in app purchase yet.
B00881PPTO|1.0|they make commission off you.  though they pretend that this is a &quot;pro&quot; version.  I doubt anyone would pay for it
B00899DR40|4.0|No need to skip not one song on this album. Every song keeps you interested. I never thought I'd be on the JB bandwagon, but here I am...Black, married and still loving every song.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|The writing was disappointing, the storyline was dull, and I just can't see what in the world all the to-do was about this book.  If you want to read this kind of writing, Anne Rice did it much better in the Sleeping Beauty books.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I've always liked Klondike but the ads are very annoying.  Wish I could get rid of them cause I don't want to buy anything.
B005COO1X6|2.0|This one was disappointing to me.  I didn't especially care for the story and so was ultimately disappointed while reading it.
B002GHIPYI|4.0|This is my 5th set of headphones, and no the other ones are still working fine, but for some reason I like trying out different companies to see which one is best. I am not an audiophile or ever get to that level, but I have been trying to look for inexpensive headphones that give decent sounds and no leak. Sadly, none yet and honestly, if I had not buy all of these headphones, I would have been able to buy one that has no leak, but I wouldn't have it any other way. As for these headphones, i would say that they are decent and in high volume (of course) they do leak. I studied in a room with many people before, but have yet to hear them complain about noise level.
B008602KQI|5.0|My 12 year old is a huge Hunger Games fan, and so she was thrilled about this.  Even the adults in my household (myself included) liked this one.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Could not put the book down. It was the one of the best books I read in a while. Had me going until the end as who the killer was. Just wish she would stop making Kay talk about what (or who the killer is get too it)....
B00881PPTO|4.0|This has the exact same permissions as the free version that has 170 reviews,  averaging 4.5 stars.  Why do people freak out about permissions on FAOTD offerings but ignore them altogether when downloading apps on their own?<br /><br />I regularly use the free version, and might as well switch to this version without ads. Calm down people!
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Enjoyed this Crossfire novel.  Fun to read, with unexpected tiwst.  I look forward to future novels by Sylvia Day.  Adding to my favorite writer list.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Great series,  However, there was a problem with a couple of the DVDs as they didn't not play smoothly.  Kept freezing on a couple of the disks.
B008CP92ZO|3.0|Being a huge fan of Paul Rudd and also a fan of Jennifer Aniston I had very high hopes of this movie.  But alas I came away a bit disappointed.  While it does have it's moments hear and there on the whole it just wasn't as good as it should have been.  The jokes kinda fell flat.  One highlight was Alan Alda in a role you typically wouldn't picture him in.  Other than Clueless this might have been Paul Rudd's weakest performance that I have seen.  I thought Jennifer Anistion did a pretty good job and as always she was very easy on the eyes.
B005G4TJUC|5.0|Birthday present!!
B009GEBBNQ|3.0|I can't say that I disliked this movie at all.  I was entertained throughout.  I just think that it was way overhyped by everyone.  While I'm glad it boosted Joss Whedon's name I think it was far from his best work.  It doesn't even come close to The Dark Night Rises.  But then again I haven't been a very big fan of a lot of these Marvel Movies.  While the Hulk was amazing I didn't like David Banner's character at all.  I hated the Thor movie and he doesn't do much for me again.  In fact of the movies leading up to this the only ones I liked a lot were the first Iron Man and Captain America.  I kinda liked the second Hulk movie and am just a little bit mad that Ed Norton didn't return to the role,  Thor is flat out on the worst movies I have seen in awhile.  At least thats my assumption because I haven't finished watching it in two attempts.
0684135051|4.0|Elizabeth Zimmerman! How can you go wrong? This book is well worth every penny if just for her little hints!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I loved reading this book.  It was well written and engaging.  One of the better stories about Seal Team victory.
B0098VYKSA|3.0|Not the best film, but entertaining enough to get your attention. Recommended for a rainy day or when there's nothing better else to watch.
B0060D123K|5.0|Classic!  It's good for my 6yo, and gives good learning chances.  The best way to see a classic Christmas story.
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|This is a great movie. I recommend it for the whole family. The underlining message is ever so applicable to all those with children. My familiy and I really enjoyed it..!
B000069KGM|5.0|My favorite album by Chicago.  Brings me back to the Beginning, in Chicago.  Great days for music.  Great place for music. CTA
B008FPZQRO|5.0|this was  the first multichannel disc i listened too when i upgraded hi-fi and integrated into hi-end surround(5.o)(1st movie was U-571-unaware it was demo favorite), so I was 2 for 2 on auditioning my system with top choices for each media.  I think u need a 5 point racing harness in the chair if u hear this in hi-res system. I had always thought the Tarkus suite was incredible, most of the rest just filler.In surround, the whole album is magnificent.  Bitches Crystal is awesome-full scope of song concept comes to life, it's a monster. The suite is stunning. No overstatement. Better listen than DSOTM, IMO. If u go for  multichannel, this is a must have. Enough said.
B003MXB4FC|5.0|Watched it twice by myself, hardly laughed.  Watched it with my 12 year old son and we both laughed so hard it was ridiculous.  Truly a funny movie.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I was engrossed and horrified at the same time.  My favorite Gillian Flynn so far. Such a different style, that is a guilty pleasure.
072325804X|2.0|The book in the photo is what I wanted and have given as a gift before. The one I received was a totally different cover not even similar! I didn't like it as well but there was not enough time to try an exchange with you before I needed to give the gift at a special occasion. Totally disappointed in you. Meredith
1455502758|4.0|but the author died, which I guess was the point of the book. Fascinating to follow the dying of an atheist; unlike some, I didn't expect a deathbed conversion, but it was  inspiring to see that his love of life followed him out. A good read for anyone who is going to die sometime.
B0044WUQ3G|3.0|the overall concept was good but the acting was very amateurish and the plot was so awfully thought out that it was laughable.
B007U1FEQW|1.0|This will be a very short review. First of all, I have not listened to the album in its entirety. I quickly realized that they've chosen to put auto-tune on the vocals. This is not acceptable. Not because I'm against the use of such technical aids as a principle, but because it sounds devilishly horrible. The metallic, artificial sounding timbre of auto-tune ridden vocals is the last thing I want to think about when spinning an album by the beach boys. How other reviewers have come to accept this kind of music rape, is beyond me. Auto-tune disqualifies this album from a sincere evaluation of the music on it. There is a limit. Puke.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The book was very good. The book was interesting.  It captured the interest from the beginning and held it until the end.
0425263916|5.0|Loved the book could not put it down. Recommended to all my friends.  Cant wait for the third book, too bad its so far away.
B000INAXGU|4.0|Didn't know much about this band but my family and I love &#34;Canned Heat&#34; from Napoleon Dynamite so I thought I'd try them out. GREAT compilation of disco and funk. Good production as well. I'm pleasantly surprised!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|The book was very interesting and had good history for that time era although it was fiction.  Great book, couldn't put it down.
B005CAAURG|5.0|This has always been one of my favorite Queen offerings. A little less bombastic but a great rock album. Was originally panned by the &#34;critics&#34; - what morons! LOL
B005K01VZS|4.0|I always enjoy Mitch Albom's books.  I look forward to his stories.  They offer great lessons on life.  Definitely recommended.
B008XCJ03K|5.0|Music is my passion and Passenger is my new favorite group. You will not find a similar sound with another group.
B000067FP8|5.0|I love this sequel as much as the first film!  It is extremly entertaining and enjoyable.  I have both films now and watch em all the time!
B00881VLCE|5.0|this game is always fun and entertaining to do. it is also good for kids and adults. I love it!
B000P0J0A6|5.0|Great movie, and the sequel is just as wonderful!  I love this movie.  Glad i finally was able to purchase from amazon!
B0093DNRY6|3.0|These guys got my attention with &#34;Never Stop&#34;...a CD that came with a bonus DVD that is a great profile of the band. After that, I purchase several other BP albums with mixed feelings about each. This one fits that bill...some good, some not so impressive tracks.<br /><br />As a drummer, I'm a big fan of Dave King, so - as I state in the title of this review - I'll keep hanging in there to hear Dave's awesome drumming. I'm just not sure &#34;Made Possible&#34; is making any progress with this trio. Some of the more experimental tracks get a little dissonant without carrying the listener, in my opinion. I do like free jazz, but it's a fine line between &#34;leading&#34; and &#34;losing&#34; the audience.
B00005O5CM|5.0|I had so much fun watching this movie.  I found it uplifting and entertaining.  I definatly reccomend this movie to everyone!
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|I love Angry Birds, and have nearly every edition, on my phone, computer and at Facebook. While the Bad Piggies is fun, it's too difficult and too much work for me. I guess I get frustrated to easily.
0547564651|5.0|A very thorough review... Fantastic and insightful read. I've bought several copies for my friends and educators I know.  I highly recommend this book.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Fun game, great levels. Even with the ads that come with the free edition, they are not too &#34;in your face&#34;. I Love Angry Birds!
B009X01GJ2|5.0|I mainly went with this case because it looked fairly sturdy and I liked the color selection. Upon getting it, I like the padding and protection it offers. I like the ability to stand it up both portrait and landscape and I really like the on/off feature. It did take me a few minutes to figure out you can rotate the hard shell all the way around so you can charge while the case is closed but other than that, I have loved everything about it.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I'm addicted to this game, and obsessed in getting three stars on every level! Just the right amount of difficulty. Love it!
B006885EFE|5.0|This is one of the greats!  Should be a video for all world history classrooms.<br />I would point out that I thought I was ordering the DVD set.<br />Was not familiar with streaming video purchases. It all happened so fast.<br />There is not forgiveness when buying Digital Media at Amazon.<br />There are no order cancellations, exchanges, returns or credits.<br />I am not happy to be stuck with this steaming video version when I<br />thought I was buying the DVD set.  Expensive lesson learned.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|It's an intersting read and sheds some light on what one guy was thinking during is time in service.  In my opinion it included information about things that should have been kept out of the book and wouldn't have changed the story.
B00846F1YW|1.0|Overall I liked the game until I finished level 13 and then would bring me back to amazon apps. I paid for my game and am unable to move on! The situation is frustrating.
B001NHNG64|5.0|this book like the first in the series keeps you interested and can't wait to see what is going to happen nest.  This one allows the reader to guess correctly more so than the other ones in the Reacher series but I would still recommend it to anyone interested in the Reacher  series.
B002PWB7C6|1.0|At several points in the movie the sound cut out for a few minutes.  It didn't matter whether I was on the stereo channel or 5.1, it just had no audio track.  Also the HD had issues in places and the screen glitched a lot.  I love the movie, but I'm a bit upset that there is no way to contact Amazon customer service regarding issues with the streaming video.  The support portal is still geared for physical products.  For 3.99 I'd expect a better streaming experience and or a way to contact Amazon for support.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I read this bok after reading One Shot.  I enjoyed it as much as One Shot and will read all of the books by Lee Child and the Reacher series.  You can read any of the books in any order without missing anything.  I prefer to read them in rder but that's just what a prefer not necessary to understand the story of each book.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|when i first tryed it it was hard to figure out all of the birds being that im not a star wars fan (Sorry) but i got into it quick and it is fun I can wait to get the rest.
B00005JKNC|5.0|My husband and I love this show.....We could watch it all day long.....I bought this a christmas gift for him.  Had quick delivery and item was as described
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Hey my name is Caleb and I'm gona tell u that this game is good for pasing the time plus it entertaining good choice to buy if u want to chat email me at calebr422@comcast.net. see ya later
B004ZZS4CC|3.0|I feel for Jaycee Duggard and the live she's had to live. I was really interested in this book, but unfortunately it was hard to get through because the writing wasn't very engaging.
B000XUBC5E|5.0|Another awesome read by Harlan Coben. Definitely a page turner with a lots of juicy twists. Quick, exciting read! 5 stars
1400049628|4.0|The book is a great read, especially for the zombie enthusiast or survivalist. The book is well made and is very nice to flip through and read during down time.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Read it in two days! Definitely would recommend for someone who is looking for a book with lots of twists.
B007857FOO|1.0|Don't get me wrong i'm a twi fan but.....<br />I got this one from walmart not target. Target was nicer but more expencive. The box is deceiving!!!! I beleived that it would be all cardboard almost like a hardcover book like all the other twilight gift sets. Not so!!! The white case you see in the picture is just hard paper almost a dustcover for the dvd thats inside which looks just like the 13 dollar dvds you see in the store. All thats \\"special\\" about this version of twilight dvd is that it comes with a fabric poster, that you can't hang with scotch tape but will have to nail to the wall or frame. Frame not included. I'm a collector and have all twilight gift sets from target and was VERY disapointed with how cheap this one was. NOT worth 40 dollars! Wait until both parts get put into a combo pack.
B00A77II0U|5.0|nice graphics..never boring....nice flow...one of the best Ive played on the kindle fire. If you like a good story line and puzzle solving,  this game will be well worth your time.
B000IU3XTW|4.0|Skin and Bones joins relics such as Nirvana and Alice In Chains unplugged CDs. Every song is solid and unique in its one way.
B00A6N7BS0|4.0|Good Action flick but Very gory!  But good storyline to follow.  Didn't expect the ending.  Could have cut out the flying brain matter.
B004HX4RT6|4.0|I found this game well designed and it plays well too. Haven't had it force close on me. Loads pretty fast and can play for hours.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|It's got a good plot,  okay dialog,  great effects and the ending was quite unexpected but it prompted me to watch the follow-on movies. It wasn't slow and plodding like Battleship at the beginning and had a good pace throughout.
B009NCM248|4.0|Corey and the crew nailed it on this one. The last album (Audio Secrecy) was disappointing, but this album made me remember why I love this band so much. Songs like &#34;Gone Sovereign,&#34; &#34;Absolute Zero,&#34; and &#34;RU486&#34; really rock, why mellower, acoustic tunes like &#34;Taciturn&#34; (an instant classic) bring the album full circle. Ranks close to their second album Come What(ever) May.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|A fun movie to watch with the family or by yourself, Pixar always puts out quality movies. I thoroughly enjoyed this film.
B005DI65L2|5.0|Professor Horowitz offers the general reader an artfully written professional survey of humankind's best friend.  From their first interactions with stone age man to the present, Horozitz provides an engaging \\"from the dog's point of veiw\\" narrative that any dog lover will enjoy. Especially interesting are her discussions of a dog's sense of sight and smell, compared to humans.<br /><br />This book will make a great gift for the holidays or a weekend read!
B0086700CM|5.0|The app works great on my kindle it is easy to play and yet still entertaining. Highly recommended for almost every age.
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|This movie is suitable for anyone at any age. A great movie to watch with the whole family. I will watch many more times.
B0046XMTZG|3.0|This is what you would expect from a graphic novel made into a movie.  Not the best, but not the worst.  I would probably watch this again.
B003THHIEM|5.0|I have been a Castle fan since the show started, because Castle is such a great crime comedy show. I love the banter between characters.  The writing is excellent, the show has great character development, making it really fun to watch.  Even going back and re-watching episodes, there are many little details that you miss the first time, that make this show continually enjoyable to watch. Definitely recommend this show, it's so much better quality than other shows I've tried to watch lately!
B009CG2YDE|4.0|just played a few levels, but controls work fine on my HTC inspire. good fun, time killer, arcade style galaga-ish.
B003TH14H4|5.0|I have been a Castle fan since Season one, because Castle is such a great crime comedy show. I love the banter between characters.  The writing is excellent, the show has great character development, making it really fun to watch.  Even going back and re-watching episodes, there are many little details that you miss the first time, that make this show continually enjoyable to watch. Definitely reccommend this show, it's so much better quality than other shows I've tried to watch lately!
B0014D6PCO|4.0|I enjoyed this movie because it helped set the scene for The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises, but I realized that it wasn't entirely necessary for me to enjoy the other two movies.  I like the way this trilogy of stories is told, so I was probably always destined to like this movie.
B0043WDK2G|5.0|I have been a Castle fan since Season one, because Castle is such a great crime comedy show. I love the banter between characters.  The writing is excellent, the show has great character development, making it really fun to watch.  Even going back and re-watching episodes, there are many little details that you miss the first time, that make this show continually enjoyable to watch. Definitely reccommend this show, it's so much better quality than other shows I've tried to watch lately!
B0049VVE7Y|5.0|This is by far the best television series about zombies and human survivors.  I love the characters and the stories behind them.

B00005K9LM|4.0|I bought this album because I wanted all my favorite tracks like &#34;Jawbreaker&#34; and Rock Hard Ride&#34; Free on there
B002B79BVO|5.0|I would recommend this show to those who enjoy well-written plots and period pieces.  This show does a great job of portraying the attidues in society during the 60s era.
B0045XICB2|5.0|The Twilight saga is one of my all time favorite movies. I read the books and I loved them & I really love the movies as well. I will be watching these over and over again. Starting when I get home from work today.
B00AA7O22U|2.0|The Expendables franchise continues to be less of a love letter to the kickass actioners of the 80s and 90s and more of a crude teenage sex poem to the stuff lining the bottom of the Walmart bargain bins. Stallone seems content to just rest on the laurels of the concept, and both times the execution ends up feeling as lifeless as half of the cast's respective leathery faces. Instead of doing something interesting with the established and well-worn conventions and cliches, Sly's just fine with laying down and making snow angels in them. And though tons of stuff blows up, none of the action is even any good, which, in this case, is like screwing up the ground beef on a hamburger.
B000N2HBSO|4.0|There was a good amount of information not widely known to ordinary people. gave good insight to the movie. i would recommend it to most of my friends.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I loved this book. The characters were well developed and were people I could relate to. The romance between Travis and Abby is just so sweet. Travis is such a badass guy but has never loved a woman, and Abby becomes his best friend and the love of his life. He comes to depend on her emotionally and Abby who emotionally was more independent and hesitant to give in to the relationship, also comes to depend on the comfort he provides her. You can really feel with the authors writing style the depth of emotions of each character. I highly recommend this book.
B009LA1QW6|5.0|Some people are going to tell you that this album is too slow compared to Born to Die. These people must not have listened to the entire EP and thought of it as its own unique entity. While there are sad, slow songs, this album cannot be categorized as such. Just listen to \\"American\\" and \\"Cola.\\" Also, how can someone not love Lana Del Rey's homage to Walt Whitman with \\"Body Electric\\"? I say buy it. I've already listened to it three times in one evening.
B000H4QD1O|5.0|This is the best sci fi show in existence. I watch each episode over and over and wish there were more. I cant believe they cancelled it!!! :(
B009VB9VKY|1.0|Terrible movie. I do not think this should have had such great ratings with the critics. I could not stand any of it.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|I love the ending to Harry Potter, everything they did in this movie blew me away. The price you can't beat, and even though there arent many special features, you get your own digital copy. :)
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Good going bloc going good enjoyed this book wasn't his best but enjoyaboe enjoyed av lot more than become others
B001UV4XHY|5.0|The price of this movie couldn't be beat!!! And even though there aren't many special features, for those who want just the movie I highly recommend!
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|This was for my grand daughter and she loved it. She watched it a number of times while it was rented. She wanted me to get it again.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Some details in the book don't add up but it was an entertaining read.  Grisham showed his creative imagination once again.
B0006OBPTA|5.0|My kids loved these and it made me remember watching these with my parents. Good memories. Gave us a chance to talk about bullying.
B005HJU7HA|4.0|There are a few formatting issues and typos, but totally worth it for the price! The stories cannot be beat.
B004U8ZH8S|4.0|This is beautiful to look at and is a nice handling of the Rapunzel story. It's funny, not condescending, and well-done entertainment.
0321701763|4.0|I could not find the book in my country out of stock<br /><br />I got the book within one week its ok<br /><br />I'm happy with the result
B008MG1E4A|4.0|This was a very literate, caring, and enlightening story of the Bin Laden hunt. I'm glad that it did not seem like a 'cheesy' expose.
0307454568|4.0|Great series of books.  This one was very good but I enjoyed number 2 the most.  So sorry Steig died so soon after submitting his manuscripts.
B001VLXNLU|5.0|i started reading these serious just to see if i would be interested in this subject&#62;  OMG!! i couldn't stop&#62; as soon as i finished the first book, i could not wait to start the next and the next etc!!!
B009CG2YDE|5.0|I like it.  It's basically a 16 bit, motion controlled, Space Invaders type shooter with upgrade elements like what you see in Breakout.  Simple, fun, addictive, and rewarding.  Perfect for a few minutes of good fun at a time on your phone.
0525952926|2.0|I've read everything Ken has written and loved them all, but I was disappointed with winter of the world. The first half was nothing but ragging on fascism. We know fascism was bad, but he just goes on and on. I got bored. And then their was one love seen after another, more like a soap opera. The second half was better, but still not anything I cared for. And it cost $20 and you can't loan it. The third book.......I think I'll pass.
B004ZQBP3Q|4.0|I run a limo company and needed to update the tunes in the cd-6pack. This works. I enjoy a few of the songs, the rest is noise, the kids seem to like it a lot.
B005F3XV7Q|5.0|If you like Kevin James, then you will simply love this film. He was truly hilarious in this one. I laughed just as hard as I did when I watched Paul Blart: Mall Cop. A+++
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|The HD playback was NOT HD.  It was fair at best.  The audio did not always match the video.  The movie was funny and worth renting.
B009NQKPUW|1.0|Bad picture , skips alot and very slow down load. Not 1080P picture. Alot of bad pixel and very slow. Sound quilty is really bad too, cant hear what there talking about. I need to rise the volume very high just to hear talking but very static. Am using comcast hisg speed internet too.<br /><br />P.S Netflix is still better
B004FOA84A|5.0|I love this game so much it is really cool there's so much stuff you can do I reccomend this game for people who like mysterys.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I love this series. I watched it a while ago, and then ordered it so that I could watch it with my boyfriend. The first episode is a little slow, but after he watched the second episode, he was asking to watch just one more episode. It's addicting and a great story.
B001NLKWLW|3.0|The book is overly long and switches from one generation to another so frequently, that you must not let much time pass between reading it or you will spend too much time going backward to refresh the details.
B0039RY3MM|4.0|the best and easy to apply metal thermal compound for extreme overclockers (good for deliding too!). product itself is excellent, giving one less star only because the seller (frozencpu) overcharges seriuosly for it ($22 including shipping) and purchased here only because sidewindercomputers.com was out of stock ($12.99+2.99 shipping) ... at least I paid with rewards and not real money ...
0788860275|5.0|I bought this for my kids and they love it! I would highly recommend this product!
B009329ZF2|2.0|I gave this 2 stars because it is pretty to look at.  Other than that, expect a litany of cheeseball one-liners, a whole lot of predictability, and ridiculous acting.  As far as the plot goes, this movie offers you everything you've likely seen many times before.  There was no real attempt to give you anything new in that development.  I'll admit I didn't expect much from Rihanna branching out into acting, but it was still a little disappointing I just couldn't help it.  She didn't offer anything to the movie by her being there other than throwing her out there like 'Here, have Rihanna.' And if her role had been entirely removed from the script there wouldn't be a hole left behind.<br />Don't expect there to be any memorable characters in this movie, but in the fashion of Transformers, if you enjoy CG explosions and little else, some parts of this you're bound to find entertaining.
B004UJAOLM|4.0|I enjoyed this classic.  I didn't know the story prior to reading it and once I adjusted to the older style prose it was a pleasant read.
B009E9QOEO|5.0|excellant cd. very well done and recorded. The music is classic Zeppelin. it was shipped out very quickly and arrived the next day.
B00AA7O6QC|4.0|This was just a fun, tounge in cheek action movie.  Laughed each time there was dialoge borrowing a line, or scene from each of the &#34;aging&#34; action stars previous movies.
B0045XICB2|4.0|We rented the movie for our date night.  We had both already seen it before.  My wife sees all the Twilight movies as soon as they come out at the theater. The process of ordering the Amazon movies is very simple. It was the first time I had downloaded a movie from Amazon.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book was incredibly well written and I couldn't put it down!! There were several mention stating was a lot like the Grey's books, but this book much better reading.
B00466HM28|5.0|I really like this mini keypad. I can plug it up to my iPad and work with garage band with it. Very versatile.
B005LAJ17M|5.0|Once we started watching, we couldn't stop.  My wife and I spent a big chunk of our weekend watching the entire season.
B001JOIEZ4|5.0|I could only get a few of the songs I wanted by buying the whole album, turns out it was worth it!
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|This game is a lot of fun & requires thinking!  Nice mix of easy, medium & hard tasks.  My 4 & 7 year old grand children love it also.  Teaches problem solving & basic physics.  The whole family is addicted now.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Love the story, the characters, the settings, the period detail. The romances are full of drama that never veres over the top into farce, because the writing and acting are Just. That. Good. Delicious. Wish I could enjoy watching it again for the first time, but I'll settle for owning it so I can watch it whenever I want! Same writer as Gosford Park--Julian Fellowes. Similar in its wit and insight into human nature. For everyone who loves a grand sweeping story with lots of great characters--the historical time period April 1912 to spring 1919 is wonderful and engaging--seasons framed by the sinking of the Titanic to after the Spanish Flu outbreak at the end of WWI.
B007FEFLTO|1.0|This book is not worth the money or the time it takes to read it.  To summarize this book:  upper-class Britons having sex with upper-class Britons; lower-class Britons having sex with each other; occasional inter-class sex; some other variations, all forbidden given the time in history.  Stilted, boring dialog.  Historical juxtapositions, a la Forrest Gump (Churchill, FDR, etc).  This book goes on and on and on from the 1920's to the late 1940's; the heroes are dull and predictable, the villains are dull and predictable.  I thought it was never going to end.<br />You are wasting your time and money if you buy this book.  It is the worst book I've read in a long time.  I will definitely not read the third book of this \\"trilogy\\".
B008X9Z3UC|4.0|This case fits the Fire HD beautifully, but with the shorter battery life (compared to my old Kindle), there is no room for the charger in the case, since it fits SO well.  Needs a small pocket for the wires and the plug.  Then it would be perfect.
B006L9B6TI|5.0|I like the idea of teaching us to be more grateful.  Only half way through but love the structure.  Teach a basic principle, have you write your personal thoughts on that principle in a journal.  Love it!
0307200477|4.0|Wonderful book, which my 1 year old son loves! But, greatly dislike the binding! This is the 60th anniversary edition - I would think this would have come up before. The binding is very cheap ring-binder type.
B005GSY23M|4.0|After the first few tracks, the soundtrack takes a slow, somber, musical turn. Which, while very good, is not something I can simply 'listen to.' That said, it's great to listen to while working or doing any other activity.
B003VANOFY|3.0|Currently on my second headset after shipping the first back to Logitech. Both headsets will occasionally disconnect from the base station before beeping and coming back online. Since I use these for both music and work phone calls this can go from annoying to down right frustrating depending on the situation.<br /><br />Sound quality and battery life are both pretty good, so as long as you're prepared that the connection may drop these are decent wireless headphones and will usually work quite well for you
B002RKSZKI|4.0|Emma is probably me favorite book by Jane Austin. I do not want to give away anything, but you must get to know this wonderful girl.
B0012QCZ54|5.0|Given as gift to granddaughter because she likes this kind of dvd.  I hope it makes her happy.  That's all.
B000JMLFLW|4.0|Long and wordy. Don't read it when you are tired as it does require some concentration. Keep your characters straight!
B009ANP4F4|5.0|Given as gift to granddaughter because she likes this kind of dvd.  What more can I say?  That is all.
B000OT8GCQ|4.0|About what you expect from Sparks. He writes a good book. Romance and love, you know, that kind of thing.
B004529NKC|5.0|Giving as gift to granddaughter because she enjoys this kind of dance and music.  I have never listened to it.
B002RKSZWG|4.0|I have all of the Jane Austin books. I like them all. I like the period and find it interesting to see how women were treated in that time.
B0046E5HCM|5.0|going to see pink in March i cant wait.... bought the cds to brush up on some of her music
B002RKS81O|4.0|I like Jane Austin. If you use your imagination you are immersed in the time and place. This book was a little more complicated than some of the others, however.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Have always used FB and this app seems to work rather well on the Kindle Fire HD. A must have using on your Android system.
B005HSL626|5.0|Fun, easy game to learn for the whole family.  Good time killer when riding in a car or waiting on someone.
B0074V3712|4.0|Mr. Wilson's comparison of social behavior in insects and in human beings is interesting.  The similarities in the prerequisites to social behavior are interesting.  Most notable are the way social behavior is hard-wired and rigid in insects and is much more flexible in human beings.  Of most interest to me was Mr. Wilson's commentary on the nature of man, specifically that our selfish interests and our altruistic group behavior are in conflict.<br /><br />My only complaint is that much of the material seemd repetitive (e.g. the communal nest as prerequisite for social behavior).
B006LSZECO|5.0|Page turner for sure! I love this book and have recommended to many friends. The suspense at the End of every chapter kept my nose in this book til the end.
B008G8SFGO|3.0|The sound of Monster successfully follows that of Creatures of the Night and Revenge (the best KISS albums of the 80s and 90s, respectively) but the songwriting simply isn't up to par.  Songs like 'Back to the Stone Age' and 'The Devil Is Me' start with promise but don't go anywhere and much of the album sounds like filler.<br />Still, it is much much better than Sonic Boom, for it actually delivers two good songs ('Wall of Sound' and 'Freak') and one very good song 'Long Way Down.'<br />For those three songs, it is worth buying.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|This book was not at all what i expected. It is suspenseful, disturbing, and a real page turner. The way it is written from the boys perspective leaves a lot of mystery to the story, I enjoyed his perspective.
B00A6SZRJ0|5.0|Two Steps are the best out there and literally work magic in the studio. Their music takes you somewhere else. Skyworld is another masterpiece of their evolving music.  They are hard to departmentalize.  I'd describe them as HyperEpic Classical. Beautiful music.
B009CG2YDE|5.0|This is a nice throwback to classic games. It is a retro feel and look. The gameplay is smooth and fun.
1449410243|5.0|This is a Christmas present for my daughter but, looking through the book, it looks like it will be lots of laughs, especially for a cat lover.<br /><br />The book arrived right on time and in perfect condition.  Thank you.
B005VPRDAY|5.0|My daughter loves these Legos! Very girlie! Perfect gift for her at the age of 8 years old! Very happy!
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|Simple on first appearance, but increasingly complex and engaging, with a bang of an ending. Highly recommended for book clubs for an engaging discussion!
B003B02O7I|4.0|I love his characters.  He has a way of redeeming a tarnished soul.  The plot for this one is again excellent.
B009LK6JS2|5.0|Holy cow this app blew me out of the water I have the graphics turned all the way down and it still looks great once in a while minor graphical glitches and my hardware is a bit under powered so I get minor bits of lag sometimes but if you are wondering about the quality of this it is a fantastic game you take off and land which really takes a bunch of trial and error you will crash multiple times but very rewarding once you get the hang of it.
B000FC1GJW|4.0|I read this to see if the series would be good for my 10 year old grandson.  I found it a bit advanced for him, more suitable for a 14 year old.  If a person has an issue with the way these books question religion, they may not like them as much as I did.  Well written, excellent plot, thoroughly enjoyable.
B005QPGHQU|5.0|I will never grow tired of the sound this group produces.  Both powerful and classic. Amy's vocals are strong and her experience continues to grow with each album.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|For me, Grisham has a way of pulling me into the book to the exclusion of what else is going on around me.  The plot is a bit reminiscent of The Firm, but that doesn't distract.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I love hidden object games. I could play them all day long if not careful. I like how this game has different things to do.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Enjoy the audio, it help me understand the Word better. I like that you can step-up different reminders to help you keep on track.
B004P4KMSC|5.0|Great truck! Already have several Bruder trucks and our grandson loves them all. They are sturdy with lots of moving parts to manipulate.
B0059XTUVI|2.0|This movie focused heavily on Thatcher's mental state near the end of her life. Apparently she had some form of dementia. We only get a brief moment on the Falklands War. We get some archival footage that is accurate. Less accurate are some of the staged sections depicting attacks by Irish Nationalists/Republicans. The car MP Neave is blown up in should be blue, not red. The INLA took him out. When the Provos trashed out the hotel in Brighton where the Conservative Party was holding a meeting I thought the filmaker could have covered it better. All in all a disappointing movie from the historical angle.
B00942Y0TM|5.0|Maximus is the best character of the movie. The entire movie is fun and entertaining. Highly recommended for all ages.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I listened to all sounds and without a second thought I purchased the full version. That's the first time I ever spend money on an app. But that's how good it is!! Very genuine, crystal clear sounds. My cats get exited with the bird ones.. so realistic :)
B002GHHHPQ|3.0|I saw this film may years ago and wanted to see it again after recently reading a book about bombers in WW2. It's quite a good film; once it gets into the air about half way through it certainly improves and the aircraft action scenes are pretty good so the film won't disappoint. The reasons why it only gets 3 stars are not big reasons but nevertheless: (1) the talk over at the beginning is vomit inducing, the film has too many cliches and becomes too predictable (even though we know how it will end)  and most the aircrew (10 of them) are, for me anyway, very irritating young actors! At the end of the day, in spite of everything the movie is a light-weight when it should have been better.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|As soon as I listenend to all sounds I didn't think twice and bought the full version. Never paid for app before but it's that good! Wrote review on the trial version also. Very good app!!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Once I figured out how to play, I have enjoyed it.  Some tiles match, the flowery ones, that don't look alike.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|Good movie all around great acting would recomend it for anyone to see it makes you laugh and cry .
B001RP1G0U|4.0|Is it predictable? Yes. Is it formulaic? Yes. But is it entertaining, funny and witty? Yes! It's a sweet feel good film.
B005HSG3VK|2.0|It doesn't hold the kindle in place, but like the protection I get.  I don't like giving reviews anymore...you require too much description
B007RKPO84|5.0|I heard and liked Kreator long ago (Flag of Hate).  I have followed and liked them through their career.  One thing is apparent.  These are genuine musicians.  They continuously focus on music and strive it improve.  This is a Kreator album so no breakout/crossover BS.  The experience/ intracasies/detailedness won't jump out untill after the 3rd or 4th spin but when it catches your ear you will know this is something rare.  These guys continue to improve over time and are one of metal's best
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|for a free app coin dozer does not disappoint! the coins drop smoothly and accurately and its easy to get caught up in trying to get to your next goal. definitely don't regret downloading this app
B00992CF6W|5.0|now you can bring minecraft everywhere you go this better then the Pc one and better the th Wom minecraft
034580404X|1.0|He's abusive. She's as bland as a jewish cracker.<br />She's hypocritical. The book has completely awful editors.<br />Fan fiction like this shouldn't slip under the radar.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|I watched this movie in the theater and then watched it on streaming as well. The streaming works well. I have never read the book. The movie stands on its on. It tells a very interesting and somewhat scary story. You really need to watch this with an open mind as some folks will find it very challenging material. Special effects are excellent. The story is violent so be warned there is a lot of explicit violence.
B004TI5N38|5.0|I enjoyed this book. David Baldacci is a personal favorite and never disappoints. I would recommend this book to a friend.
B0086700CM|4.0|Down load this and get ready to kill some time with your device of choice. You are running through a temple being chased by some kind of monster. You have to watch out out for the changing walk ways as well as other obstacles. Lots of fun and plays well on a number of devices.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|This action movie has great stars and a lot of action.  My family and I watched it recently, then we found out that they're making a sequel of it with many--if not all--of the main cast!  It makes a bit of a political statment that some may not agree with.  But, I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B0090EIILU|3.0|A funny mindless movie for when you just want some pointless fun. Watched it on the streaming option. The streaming technology worked well enough.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Arrived on time. Kids like the movie. Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks
B00881PPTO|1.0|I got this as the free app of the day today and I am in complete disbelief.<br /><br />This is Cyber Monday and Amazon chooses to give us this app for free???<br /><br />If you read the last part of the app description it says:<br /><br />\\"This PRO app is the same as the free app; the only difference is that there are is no text banner ads on result pages.\\"<br /><br />SO WHY GIVE US AN APP THAT IS ALREADY FREE AMAZON???  I THOUGHT THE WHOLE POINT OF THE FREE APP OF THE DAY PROGRAM IS TO OFFER AN APP THAT IS NORMALLY A PAID APP FOR FREE?<br /><br />Sorry if I sound very upset, but I was really expecting something nice as the free app of the day with this being Cyber Monday.  Is that too much to ask for?  If the app is the same as a version that is already available for free minus the ads, and I really wanted this app, I would have just gotten the free version instead of waiting for the ad free version to become free.<br /><br />Amazon, do the right thing and add a second free app of the day today!
B000MV9026|5.0|Thanks  for the movie we do enjoy having it. Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks
B009WJ44KC|5.0|No fireworks here (this is not 'Star Wars') but very Coplandesque - reminds me of Copland's 'Quiet City' or 'Our Town'.  John Wiilliams' music here is reminiscent of his 'Hymn to the Fallen' from 'Saving Private Ryan' and superbly underlines the film scenes.  If you liked the film as I do, you will find this soundtrack an excellent addition to your library.
B0053O89JM|5.0|Arrived on time. The Husband likes the movie. Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks
B0015DROBO|2.0|I havent read much of the book because I have no idea what is going on and I was not enjoying what I read.  That is my personal opinion of the book.  My older sister loved it!
B0026P3G12|5.0|Arrived on time. like it very much. Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book, author, and story line! Can't wait to read the rest of them.  It really left me hanging and wanting to read more!

0689835604|5.0|I really love every Karen Katz book I have ever seen. This one is especially cute. My two-year-old loves lifting flaps. Frankly, my four-year-old also still enjoys this book. The artwork is terrific, and the colors are vibrant. A total winner of a board book!
B003NFM3JK|5.0|Thanks  for the movie we do enjoy having it. Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks
B009A3NGF4|5.0|If possible, this album is even better than &#34;Sigh No More&#34;.  It has been on constant repeat since I got it.
1558903259|5.0|Thanks  for the movie we do enjoy having it. Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks
B0074VTHKM|5.0|I thought it was the second best book in the series behind the abduction. I think you do not need to read the books in order, but you may want to.
1419701533|5.0|Thanks  for the books we do enjoy having it. Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks
B003O86FMW|5.0|Excellent to have the book deliver to my Kindle instantly---neede to read it after finishing The Hunger Games!!<br />Certainly will buy more e-books!!

B007SZ0E1K|5.0|I just recently upgraded from some AMD 6-core Processor that really didn't do much for me. The i-5 3570k I recently bought was just the perfect upgrade in my custom PC. I bought the ASRock Z77 Extreme4 mobo along with this processor and it has worked wonders. I recently overclocked it safely at ~4.3-4.4 GHz with my Cooler Master Hyper 212 Plus and it still stays relatively cool when doing so.<br /><br />Overall, it is an amazing processor that is just a tad bit expensive but if you are looking for a huge upgrade, this would be a good upgrade.

B0085Z3B2Q|5.0|I have a serious pet peeve on Amazon: when people leave horrible reviews of good products based solely on shipping and/or service.<br /><br />And because of this, I give the product 5 stars! The combo pack was an amazing deal. We keep the DVD in our sons' room so they can watch it as they please. And we use the Blu-Ray for family movie night. AND we have the digital copy on my iPod, tablet, and my son's iPod Touch. As you can see we get so much use out of it.<br /><br />The movie is one of our favorites. Dr. Seuss laid amazing groundwork for this epic movie. The colors and detail are gorgeous. the music is super catchy and my kids actually learned something!<br /><br />CONS:<br />I PREordered this movie almost a month in advance, so it would be here the day it was released without having to fight for it at the store. Unfortunately, it showed up almost four days late. When I tried to voice my concerns, I basically just got a &#34;Sorry that sucks,&#34; in return.<br /><br />Overall I'm happy with the purchase and would do it again because of the price.

B00A6PD9I4|5.0|This has become our new go-to movie for family night in our household! The animation is beautiful and keeps both the children's and our attention. The story line is heart warming too. BUT it offers just enough &#34;scary stuff&#34; for our 3 & 5 year old boys.

B009AMAKSQ|5.0|The movie didn't just tell the book's story, it brought everything about the book to life. HOWEVER, I saw an incredible opportunity that was passed by, and it felt like it was due to political and social issues. *****SPOILER ALERT***** If you haven't read the book, skip the rest of this review.<br /><br />Charlie's sister Candace had a much bigger role in the book. Not only did she get abused, but she ended up pregnant and taking Charlie with her to get an abortion. While I completely understand the seriousness and potential backlash from society, I was really disappointed in the author (who was also the screenwriter and director) for not showcasing something like this more efficiently and giving it more screen time. I watch Nina Dobrev on TVD and I don't think they left out this storyline because she can't act (she can, and very well). I know it seems like an insignificant thing to be upset about, but the world does it's best to shove this \\"dirty laundry\\" side of life under the rug. I would have liked to see the director push it into the light and force people to see the bigger picture.<br /><br />I'm still giving the movie 5 stars, not only for it's ability to bring the book to life, but for the actors who pushed themselves to be so true to the characters. An awesome movie, and one I will definitely buy on Blu-Ray.

B0074EIQQU|2.0|I was captivated by the unique nature of the music The Mars Volta produced. Each record provided a new and sometimes bizarre look at what the possibilities really were in the music industry. '[[ASIN:B00009V7T2 De-Loused in the Comatorium]]' was a brilliant start to an off-shoot career. Following that album came the sophomore, my personal favorite, '[[ASIN:B0007GAEW6 Frances the Mute]].' These albums proved that there were musicians out there still trying to experiment and make music that they want to make instead of what the people expect. That is quite a cliché thing to say, I am aware, but I believe it. Releases following these two albums were not quite as unique, but still had the band's flare. Then came '[[ASIN:B0028SVXR6 Octahedron]],' an obvious shift in style for the band, but it was a good style shift that presented the band in a more subdued and self-proclaimed 'acoustic' light. And now we have 'Noctourniquet.'<br /><br />I purchased this album as a pre-order long ago. I figured that even though I may not have enjoyed every single song on every album they have released, I still enjoyed each album as a whole. Nothing is really odd in this sort of thinking at all, but perhaps I should have been a bit more wary. My two-star rating is meant to stand in conjunction with my thoughts on all other releases from The Mars Volta. My personal opinion of this album is that it is very slow and lacks the uniqueness that made all the other albums so alive. This is not to say that others will not enjoy it by any means. Perhaps this is the album that some fans have been waiting for, and I have no problem with that. In fact, I am hoping that's the case so that people continue to listen to them. However, this album simply did not match up to what I have come to expect from the band. Perhaps it is a bit shameful to admit that I have expectations from bands, but I do have expectations and I think many of us would be lying if we said we didn't. The song structure is so much simpler in this album than the others, and that is not quite my taste. But that is my own opinion.<br /><br />My hope is that people will give the album a shot so that they may make comparisons for themselves. For those wondering how it matches up to the other albums, I hope to have been able to help by saying that it is really nothing like any of them. And if you have been waiting for The Mars Volta to settle down a bit and produce something a little more traditional, this record is for you, and you should snatch it up immediately. For myself, though, I will revert back to the traditional ways of The Mars Volta.

B006O2QNOU|4.0|This was a really frightening look at how ridiculous high finance has become. EXCELLENT acting. I would have given it a 5 star review, but the ending was somehow lacking. Perhaps because I wanted more. It was very worth the time to watch!

B008MG1E4A|3.0|I admire the courage of the author and his service to the country and his charitable goals for the proceeds coming from the sale of the book.  The writing was sophomoric and the commentary on policy both US and military very shallow.  The details of the raid made the book worth reading, but it took a lot of words to get to the planning for and execution of the raid. Thank you Mr. Owen for your service to our country.

B0084U0IEG|2.0|My first Ian Mcewan....maybe not my last but I could not get excited at any part of the story.  Ok ending.  Too much intellectualizing throughout the rest.
030759565X|5.0|I have waaay too many cookbooks, however, I couldn't help but buy this book to support the wonderful work of Smitten Kitchen. Deb has a truly delightful approach to cooking and I've been enjoying her work (for free!) for years. I wish her all the success in the world, especially for an accidental, home-taught cook who has such a fresh perspective and who isn't afraid to play in the kitchen, take risks.
B00AA7O6QC|3.0|Lots of action, terrible one liners. Exactly what you expect it to be. Not quite as good as the first one if you ask me.
B0086700CM|3.0|Temple run is good but the grafiks some times glich on me. Temple run has good chosis of people that u can be.
B00932A2MC|2.0|enjoyable enough to watch, but set your expectations low. A few cool scenes, but for the most part this was a fairly lame film.
B008AK8FHM|1.0|I would not recommend this book , not worth $9.99 maybe 99c !  It mostly talks about his family and what they are going throu, I expected more enlightment on the other side there are much better books written on the subject out there .
B009VB7QQA|4.0|Fun movie. Terrible premise, but if you are into movies with decent action and great visuals it is worth checking out. IN HD.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love that I am able to use evernote for a variety of purposes and from anywhere.  I use it at work and can record information that can be shared with my colleagues and my administrator.
B009KHBDUU|3.0|Plenty of witty comments and good lord is there ever some sweet sweet Eva Green cleavage. Thankfully that's all I was expecting, and that's all I got.
B004Z2TUGE|3.0|I have watched better movies.  Might have liked this more if i thought the story was going somewhere.  They don't appear to be making anymore movies involving these characters.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love that I can read a verse in a number of translations, highlight verses, and make bookmarks, plus you can tag your bookmarks by topic.  It is very easy to find passages, too.
B000OVLINI|5.0|I have recommended this book to several people and only 1 person didn't like it.  So often today books are written without concern for the construction of the words, but only the outcome.  This author is a very good writer.
B008458O3S|5.0|This was the one remaining app from my iPhone years for which I kept the hardware around. Now with Trainyard on the OS, I am now 100-percent Android.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|Very boring movie.  I was excited to finally get to see this and was bored the entire time.  Waste of my time.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This game is amazing to pass time during your day  ,keeps you intrigued !!!!!  i highly recommend it for anyone that likes  continuous gameplay.
B00A6PD8RQ|4.0|Brave is a great classic tale with current era twist. My children loved this movie. PIXAR once again proves that great storytelling is still possible.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I could not put this book down. So many twists and turns, it will keep you at the ed ge of your seat till the very end!!!
B004LOMB2Q|3.0|It's one of those programs that looks nice on the surface, but gets detailed the more you get into it. The concept of storing your stuff off of your phone has good and bad points. The good point is that your data stands a better chance of surviving if your phone takes a swim and never comes back. The bad point/s deal with the security of your data (it is in someone's hands that isn't yours) and if you have no signal, you do not have access to your data.<br /><br />With storage options on phones increasing every year, the ability to store more info on your phone increases as well. Don't get me wrong. This product has its uses and benefits, but it just doesn't fill my needs right now.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Life of Pi was a wonderful ride where the reader is taken on a visual vacation like no other.<br /><br />While the story has a few lulls in it, most of the tale is enthralling.  This is the kind of book when it's over you can easily slip into a &#34;Good Book Depression&#34;.
B000W91RUG|5.0|I just love this show!  With all the drama on TV and silly reality shows, it's nice to know there are still good comedic actors and writers out there.  I love the smart wit of all the characters.
B005LAIHPY|3.0|I can suspend a lot belief in movie action for the sake of being entertained but this movie just seemed ridiculous to me. The ne'er-do-well younger brother of a Navy officer suddenly (there is no noteable timeframe) goes from B&E and burglary (for a beautiful cause) to Lt Cmd in charge of weapons on one of our most sophisticated ships in the Navy?  Then is about to be kicked out of the Navy and yet is left IN COMMAND of the weapons?  Please.  I have too much respect for our Armed Forces to buy the scenario.  At least in Transformers they didn't try to pretend any of the premise was believable.<br /><br />The story of the movie, aliens attacking and our human resolve to survive, is entertaining, even if you can believe these massive alien ships can pop out of the ocean and not so much as spray a nearby raft let alone swamp it.  I had also some problems believing Rhianna getting smacked in the chops by an alien that is clearly pressing the weight limits of our destroyer's steps (he bends them just walking on them) and she gives a weak 'ahh' and turns and faces the alien like she wants to fight it.  If it weighs enough to bend a steps of a Navy destroyer she could have at least been knocked out before miraculously surviving a massive backhand.<br /><br />One of the coolest parts of the movie was the appearance and 'enlistment' of some former sailors from the Mighty Mo.  They step up and run the ship/museum when our erstwhile techno sailors are not sure how to get it running.  I also like the Japanese captain's (and Taylor's atagonist) solution on how to track the unseen alien ships without working radar. Clever and exciting to watch.<br /><br />Overall, the movie was worth the cost of On Demand from Amazon but not worth owing or seeing in the theatre.
0553801473|5.0|This was great but the saga is not finished he needs to write more books.  The dragons are still across the sea this needs to be finished there could be a lot more books.<br />There is more of the story that should be revealed regarding a lot of<br />the characters some of their fates are still left hanging.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|My whole family enjoyed playing this game with me, even though I was keen to have it all to myself.  It's beautiful and enjoyable.  Difficult yet not too hard to lose interest.  I played it bug free on my kindle fire.
0345529057|5.0|This is a highly addicting series I hope he plans to right more books and I hope they do more<br />of the mini series.
B0044XV3R8|4.0|Despite the criticism Cameron got for Avatar, a lot of envy in that I suspect, I think the movie is actually pretty good science fiction. Sure, you might quibble with some of the scientific aspects but this is entertainment, not science class.<br /><br />A lot of people must've felt the same- enough that when the studio went beyond money grabbing with their bare bones (nothing but the movie) release, they released this version with alternate, &#34;child safe&#34;, soundtracks.<br /><br />My only real complaint is the way the different versions aren't presented one to a disc but split onto more than one. Why do that?
B006OCM0G0|4.0|This is harder and needs more dedication than bakery story but it is addictive. You will probably want to play this for a while but could get boring. It's free so this isn't a problem.
B001UV4XIS|4.0|An improvement over part 1, still preferred the book. A great deal of detail is lost in the movie version and it becomes the inevitable Hollywood finish except for all the &#34;innocent &#34; bystanders killed off.
B0086700CM|5.0|Great game but same thing over and over again. You are running away from the monkeys and you have jump, slide or turn. The biggest challenge is that it goes a bit faster.
B001UV4XHY|3.0|Book was much better the first part seems contrived to build suspense for the final installment. Difficult to watch on a TV screen.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|It can be a tough book to get through when it gets more into the BDSM lifestyle.  But I was interested in delving deeper into the characters and why Christian chooses this lifestyle.
B0087GYY92|5.0|I thought this was a great read, especially for fans of Star Trek and Galaxy Quest. It picks out the little things you always knew were silly or badly written and runs with them. Well worth the read.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|Too many descriptive sex scenes we can do without.  I liked the back story that was developing so willing to keep going.
B008RXYOKY|5.0|This is a fantastic accessory for MacBook Air or Retina MacBook Pro users. The super-thin case doesn't allow for Firewire 800 ports. But with this adaptor, you can use all your \\"old\\" Firewire 800 or 400 devices. (You can use a special Firewire 400 to 800 cable to access your really old Firewire devices). One cool thing with this adaptor is that it's doesn't have to be directly connected to your machine's Thunderbolt port. If you have several daisy chained Thunderbolt devices connected, you can add the at the end of the chain. You never have to lose out using your Thunderbolt devices when you have to use this adaptor.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I was getting tired of these two by the third book - his controlling and her trying to just &#34;love&#34; his problems away.  I was disappointed how EL James ended the story.  It was one of those times I was glad to finally be done with reading a book!
B008ALA6DW|5.0|I have a MacBook Air that I needed to connect to a wired network *and* use my Thunderbolt RAID. I thought I was out of luck. Turns out you can plug this adaptor into the end of your Thunderbolt daisy chain so you get both Ethernet and Thunderbolt connection at the same time! It doesn't have to be directly connected to your Mac. Just make sure your Thunderbolt drive has two plugs so you can daisy chain it.
B000YHG72E|5.0|great really funny movie, one farrell's best movies out there an captures the holiday spirit. Its a must see for everyone in the family.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|What can I say, other than I was curious. I don't get what all the excitement is about. There's not really a storyline and it's just not all that interesting. What's worse is that there are two more books in the trilogy, blech. Two adjectives to describe this book - boring and repetitious. Certainly not romantic. I guess you could sum it up in one word: porn.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|SD card reader works great.  Connects within about 5 seconds of pluging into the ipad with fairly quick importing.  Would definitely recommend for those not completely satisfied with the Ipad camera.
B00AA7O6QC|3.0|This is OK for a group of guys drinking beer and waiting on a game to start.  Your wife/girlfriend will make you pay if you make her watch it!<br /><br />The one liners and cameos are pretty good and I am glad to see them still acting and making money.  Lots of things getting blown up and people getting shot/knifed/beaten etc. but not too bloody.  Sly looks pretty scruffy but maybe that was the idea?
B009CPJHY4|5.0|The cast drew me in to see this film.  Maggie Smith, Judi Dench, Dev Patel.....i had a god feeling about this movie.  When i saw the film I was not disapointed.  What a fantastic storyline.  Followed all the way till the end of the film.  This is one movie not to miss.
B009K0OL06|5.0|Definitely one of the best shows out right now.  They balance the &#34;soap opera&#34; aspects very well with intrigue and you actually come to care about the characters.  Highly recommended!
B009VLX8FS|3.0|Although it is the first time listening through the whole CD, it doesn't really stand out like her last two.
B003WE9TU8|4.0|It was a long time ago that I studied history at high school- evaluating sources, checking documents, reading textbooks etc etc.  The one thing that you don't do in history class is oral history, perhaps because history is seen more as an analysis of events rather than as the older troubador tradition of telling stories.  This book is a fictional return to the art of telling stories as history, of seeing a larger picture in snippets and fragments, forming a comprehensible whole from your own interpretation of the interaction of its discrete parts.<br />As such, this makes World War Z a very clever piece of fiction, more analagous to the reading of newspapaer accounts that an blow-by blow telling of a story.  When fiction is just handed to you on a plate, there is less scope to use your own imagination to fill in the gaps and vacancies, whereas in this book, the reader is invited to place their own shape to the whole. You will find yourself wondering what happened to the protagonists, whether what hapened 'here' had an influence on 'there', who and how and why this story or that was included.<br />As such, while I understand the criticims leveled at the book as a series of seemingly unconnected incidents, disjointed and lacking real dramatic tension, I actually found that the opposite was true.  I very much enjoyed the leaps in time and place, and couldn't wait to see if there was any blow by blow account of how the war was 'won'.  I wasn't disppointed to find out there wasn't.  Allowing my own imagination to interact with the book made the whole experience intensely satisfying.<br />So, if you like plot spoon fed to you, this is not the right book.  If you like the grand tradition of storytelling as oral history, you won't be able to put this book down.
B006IDG2T6|5.0|Within this book is information that has opened up a new way of thinking about religion and spirituality for me.  In addition, there are resources listed and I found an amazing website dedicated to Free Will Thinking.  I will certainly purchase other books by Sam Harris, a man who takes logic and applies it not only to every day life but to myths about death.
B009D8RJR2|4.0|I was puzzled when I noticed the relatively low overall rating for this novel. Then I discovered that this was due to an apparent avalanche of 1 star reviews from \\"disgruntled Kindle users.\\" All I can do is shake my head in wonder: \\"Some People\\" indeed. Anyway, the issue at hand, or what should be the issue, is the quality of this novel, and I thought it was a very good one overall. Anyone who has read a few Michael Connelly novels knows what the expect and he doesn't deviate much from his standard formula this time either. The plot relies more on the Mickey Haller \\"Lincoln Lawyer\\" character this time, but Harry Bosch plays a role too, although I thought the way that Harry is portrayed, and his presence in general, was oddly subdued in this novel. The only other thing I wasn't crazy about was the ending. A bit of a suprise, especially after the reader had been led to expect something else altogether. But hey, that's the nature of novels like this, so I can't be too disgruntled. The bottom line: this is another engrossing read from Mr. Connelly.
B00A77II0U|4.0|first time reviewer. I am a huge hidden object fan. I have played other alawar and this is one of my favorites.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game is so addictive and fun!  I haven't played a good game like this since angry birds when it was new!  keep it up game circus!  I LOVE IT!!!!
B001NLKWLW|4.0|Top-notch writing.  Very exciting story.<br /><br />However, the author planted several clues about Linus' (sexual) obsession about his daughter and then about her daughter, Eliza.  About half-way through the book, I suspected that Eliza was Nell's mother, but Nathan, Rose's husband, was less indicated in clues than was Linus as Nell's father.<br /><br />I don't mind alternating time periods or viewpoints, but I feel there were too many in this book.  Thus I chose 4 stars.
B009K0P10K|5.0|Love this show and glad that I was able to catch up!!  Everyone should check out this show, it's wonderful!
0385535147|3.0|The last  Grisham book I read was non-fiction and I didn't like it. The Racketeer had interesting twists that helped, but I can see it being made into an interesting movie.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|I have always enjoyed Angry Birds and Star Wars, so the two of them together is great. Very entertaining and fun to play.
1451695195|2.0|I  really believe in an &#34;afterlife&#34; but this story was unique. The part when he was &#34;told&#34; that he could do no wrong bugged me.<br />I loved that a family member stayed on duty to hold his hand and helped him come back. I heard a review on the ABC news<br />that inspired me to buy it.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|Do not watch elementary.  Watch this. You won't regret it. Cumberbitches for life. If you don't like this, then you cannot appreciate good acting.
0385532458|1.0|I had read it before.  Didn't like it the second time.  Tired of stupid southern characters. Southerners have bred some brilliant writers and we have a lot of intelligent people here.
B0063IH60K|3.0|Have used it a little and have no complaints.  Helps me pass the time when nothing else is happening.  I don't use it much.
0547995660|3.0|I first read this book ages ago, but we selected it for a quick read for our monthly book club this month.  Somehow, I forgot that it was a \\"young adult\\" book so had to keep that in mind while I read it.  It's a very short book, and very thought-provoking, but not incredibly engaging.  Although I enjoyed the story and definitely recommend it, it wasn't an overly-exciting page-turner for me.  I think it would be wonderful for a parent to read along with their young teenager.  It reveals a very interesting societal concept and I think would open up quite a few channels for real-world communication for a parent/\\"child\\".<br />(Would give it 4-stars for young-adult readers.)<br /><br />Good read - just make sure you remember its literary level and target audience while reading and you'll enjoy it!
B000W9DTG6|5.0|The Ocean series is one of my favorite ever! I am glad I bought this series. Had no trouble getting to me either!
B009WO7NQO|4.0|Another totally time wasting, addictive version of Angry Birds. In other words, a 5 out of 5. Well, it would be 5 out of 5 if more levels came with the original purchase rather than requiring more money to unlock features.
B000EUDAWG|5.0|Got this for my dad for Christmas regardless to say ITS THE BEST THING EVER! It works well scaring people too!!
B00280LYIC|5.0|I was very stubborn about reading this book. Everyone was telling me I should and how amazing it was. Id finally caved and I was NOT disappointed. I've read a lot of books but this one stands out. I can't wait to read the next in the series!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I don't even know where to begin about this book. It has absolutely no depth to it, and the story line is desperate. The writing itself is amateur and thoughtless. I took forever to read this book because I wanted to quit reading it so many times, and I had to force myself to pick it up and read. Besides the poor writing skills of this &#34;author,&#34; the story has so many flaws. Overall, it was a bore and not worth any money.

0345803485|3.0|I bought it as a gift to my wife....she's still reading it...will let you know once she's done. I can not recommend it yet to anyone.
B00A2FSXHK|3.0|It is a fairly good movie, but it completely twists the message of Philip K Dick's story. If you've seen the other PKD movie adaptations (Next, Paycheck, Bladerunner, etc.), it is very similar in character.
0807014273|5.0|Find the meaning of life in taking responsible action everyday. That would be how I would sum up the books invention of logo-therapy. A great read!
B009VSW15Y|2.0|I love the new kindle fire. However, the only reason I upgraded from my original kindle is for the camera.I love the size, the screen, the speed of wi-fi, however,  I had planed on taking pics of my family and friends, not myself, and it is too hard to hold it at an angle to take a picture.  I will buy another one when the camera is facing outward.
0385535147|3.0|When Judge Raymond Fawcett is murdered and his safe is emptied, the FBI scrambles to solve a crime with very little evidence.  Then comes an offer from Malcolm Bannister, a former attorney who is serving time in a Federal prison camp for money laundering.  Bannister says he knows who did it and why, but he wants a deal.<br /><br />I enjoyed this clever story, which carries the reader through a plot that seems straightforward and evokes sympathy for Bannister's seemingly wrongful conviction.  Grisham introduces characters and presents facts as needed and by mid-story, we think we have an idea how it will all work out.<br /><br />But new characters and twists lead in a different direction and just enough information is left hanging until the finish, when it's all wrapped up.  In the end, you can't help but return to the beginning and rethink the characters.  Grisham shows us that the question of what is fair game does not always have a clear answer.<br /><br />I liked Bannister's character, even as we learn more about him and see to what lengths he will go.  I enjoyed the fast pace of the book and how Grisham pokes fun at the FBI.  If you're a lawyer or a former inmate and you take issue with some of the facts or unrealistic turns, make sure you read the Author's Note at the end, telling us this is \\"indeed a work of fiction.\\"<br /><br />It's been years since I read The Firm, The Pelican Brief and The Client, which I thought were excellent.  This does not seem as substantial, but entertaining nonetheless.
B006OCM0G0|3.0|but... they need more food. they have a lot of gliches. also if you bont have Internet bony get it.
B00000K3CK|5.0|One of my favorites since I was a child, plus like the black and white.  Good remake with the new one also
B0053O89IS|5.0|I LOVE ALL OF THE BONES SHOWS. I HAVE BEEN WATCHING THEM SINCE THEY FIRST CAME ON THE AIR AND THEY ARE AMUSING, EDUCATIONAL ENTERTAINMENT.
6305428042|5.0|Born and raised in Massachusetts, love the story and where they filmed a lot of it.  Always was a believer in the occult to begin with.
6305014140|4.0|The seller was a positive, no problems there, the product is in excellent condition and complete/original case. My issue is with the screen format. I think it's called Letter Box? It's kind of annoying and I would have preferred widescreen or panascan. That's the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars and this has nothing to do with the seller who was excellent.
B004SIP9RO|5.0|I am an old romantic at heart and truly believe in signs.  Cute date movie for sure, needs to be brought back again.
B005FITIDC|4.0|What a difficult ethical dilemma.  I view it as WWII writ small.  The means by which to stop evil people from doing evil things (without becoming what one is attempting to overcome) is an issue I wrestle with, although on a much smaller scale.  It is also notable that the &#34;Army of One&#34; concept is shown to be deficient.  I would expect this movie to engender substantive conversations, especially among Christians.
B00976NY6A|3.0|I'm a huge Killers fan, but this album left me very underwhelmed.  There are no &#34;must own&#34; songs on this album and the characteristic vocals of Brandon Flowers are hidden behind some failed instrumental tries.<br /><br />I don't really regret buying this, but I am disapointed.
B007UPNA6Y|4.0|A classic great Jack Reacher novel, you will not be disappointed! But I do recommend that you read the previous one before you start on third one.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|We are loving season 3, and generally have a hard time waiting for each episode!  I don't want to say anything specific, so as to not provide spoilers, but this season really carries the story forward!
B00005QZWI|1.0|The Music is great, no doubt. However the format sucks. This is recorded as an enhanced CD or ECD. You cannot play this on your computer hence rip it into MP3 files for you portable player. You will have to play it on your CD played and digitize it with a sound recorder like audacity. Then name and export each song as an MP3 file, pain in the ass. If it says \\"Enhanced\\" anywhere in the description it is an ECD so Beware!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I love this app so much it even lets you wake up to your own songs I strongly reccomend this
0880796863|5.0|This is exactly what I was looking for! The cards are colored beautifully and the book, though small, is very interesting. The back of the cards are also lovely, and probably my favorite out of all of the backs of the decks available on this website. The box is very thick cardboard and seems very durable. This pack would be a good place to start if one is interested in the tarot but isn't sure what they want from it, but I would recommend buying supplemental books.
B005HJWWW8|4.0|I have a pair of Sony MDR-V6 headphones[[ASIN:B00001WRSJ Sony MDR-V6 Monitor Series Headphones with CCAW Voice Coil]]that I use with an older Cowon D2 mp3 player. When I added this Fiio E6 to the mix I realized that I had been only scratching the surface of what those 'phones could do. When paired with my Koss SportaPros[[ASIN:B00001P505 Koss SportaPro Stereo Headphones]] or KSC 75's[[ASIN:B0006B486K Koss KSC75 Portable Stereophone Headphones]]the Fiio doesn't make much of a difference. The same goes for when I've used it with my HTC EV0 (One X) smart phone. If you turn off the Beats enhancements and use a better audio program like JetAudio you can hear the more of a difference, but ultimately this product is for using with a good mp3 player and larger headphones.<br /><br />I showed it to my audiophile step-father and he was intrigued enough to buy the E11 [[ASIN:B004QVPGXK FiiO E11 Portable Headphone Amplifier With Micca Accessory Pack (Wall Charger and Extra Battery Pack)]] and L9 cable [[ASIN:B004QVNNI0 FiiO L9 L-Shaped Line Out Dock (LOD) Cable For iPod and iPhone]] to use with his iPhone 4. He was impressed too, and this is a guy with Peachtree headphone amp at home. If you are going to use it with an iPod or iPhone definately get the L9 cable too. We tried it both ways and the sound is much better using the L9 cable with either the E6 or E11.<br /><br />If you are trying to decide between the E6 and E11 I would say the biggest benefit to the E11 is that is easier to operate and the battery life is much longer. The E6 dies after about 5 hours of being turned on. Sometimes I forget to turn it off in the morning after I get off the bus and by the time I leave work it is dead. The E6 also dies abruptly. The E11 has double the battery life and an indicator light for life. When my E6 dies forever I will be stepping up to the E11.
1433502410|5.0|This version of bible is needed if you really want to study the words of GOD. The abundant research and explanation is very handy and helpful if you want to dig deeper. I would certainly recommend this to anyone who love GOD.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its an ok game sometimes I wish I could buy more games but noooo I cant. but yeahh good game
B001HBYHFA|4.0|Movie is worth watching. However, the show far, far outshines this flick.<br />If you need a little &#34;Firefly&#34; fix, then this is for you. I sure do miss that show.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|this game constantly pauses and closes on its own everytime i open it up. it needs to be solved and then it would be  great.. but for now cant really play with it closing on me.
B008NW67E0|5.0|I liked this from the very first time I heard it. I loved the first one I bought and this one didn't disappoint.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|love angry birds. this one is great!  Never regret this purchase. or any angery birds they just keep getting more interesting to play!
B000O8OTNC|3.0|I just got this yesterday and sharpen my knives very well... I will taking it on my long year trip and see hwo it treats me and how it last.
0790736314|5.0|This is classic horror and it arrived in mint condition. I am pleased with the movie and will watch it again & again. Thank you. Kim Jones
B004LWZW7Y|5.0|Love this movie but most importantly my kids love it and are always glued to the tv when it's on.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|Made for a movie.  The reviews were better than the book.  Not a great read.  Finished reading the book, but was bored.
B005PK1G76|5.0|Purchased this for my double city mini jogger and it didn't work out too well. I'm sure if in had single it would work so much better. This thing a made from quality products and I would most definitely recommend this for anyone who needs a super sturdy cup holder. I purchased a double wide JL Childress organizer/cup holder and this is way better & much more sturdy. returned both
B000Z45PEC|5.0|La mercancia es de excelente calidad, y llego a tiempo segun lo establecido en el sistema. Lo recomiendo 100 %... Venezuela
B003629IPW|5.0|I am 62 years old and was raising a small child in the mid 80's & 90's, so was really unaware of the REAL Michael Jackson revealed on these discs. OMG!  What an amazing artist, musical genius and horrible LOSS to this world!  These DVD's brought me to tears... LOTS of tears.  An incredible performer -- better than any EVER!  His humility, grace, compassion and love were certainly not brought out in any media coverage, but rather he was made to be a bizarre child molester and after seeing these, I'm certain NONE of the negative media reports were correct.  It was shameless.<br /><br />He is a true inspiration and I have never been so impressed and my heart truly touched.  He's in heaven now and happy.  It's just a tragic loss to this world.
B007EECSFA|4.0|I always enjoy Kate Morton's historical fiction.  The Secret Keeper starts out a little slow, but it certainly picks up!!<br />You will be shocked at the end when you find out what really happened to Dorothy and Vivien!!
B000A2RRF4|5.0|Unbelievable talent!  A must watch for EVERY AGE!  I'm 62 and this was my first exposure to his live performances.
B0018QOIXU|2.0|We have enjoyed the wonderful, incredible talent of Adele &#34;21&#34; which motivated us to purchase Adele 19 that proved to be a disappointment.  Our bad!!!!
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|Adventure; maturity; family values. Good flick for the family but I find movies as this one can be meaningful to moms & dads too. Enjoy!
B00973CGXK|5.0|This was a great purchase. I would recommend to all my friends. Great way to have great music available at anytime!
B007MU85D0|4.0|I bought this album because it was on a Black Friday sale, and I loved their song Little Talks.  Overall I am very impressed with the whole album.  They are definitely a good group with some unique music.  They have a little bit of an older, folk feel to their music - similar to Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeroes.  I highly recommend this album.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|Our family is in love w/ Harry!  We all have enjoyed his books, movies, and sayings over the past several years.  Of course, this was a big hit.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|it is just a delightful movie. anyone with a pet will recognize the bond between the girl and the bird.
B0055B7IPE|5.0|This is one of the best Pixar movies I've ever seen! Great family film, and for people of all ages.
B001VNB54A|5.0|as a veteran I could see similarities between my experiences and those of the characters. as I get older I hope that my grandsons do not have experience such times
B00A7ZXDLQ|5.0|It's a great Cd it's Rhianna!! I just love the music and I own all her music, true Rhianna fan.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|it is a delightfully charming family movie.  The minions are funny and the villian is  not scary to young children.
B006YC74E8|5.0|VERY HAPPY THIS AP WAS AVAILABLE I WAS STRESSED OUT WHEN I COULDN'T GET THE CAMERA WORKING AND LOW AND BEHOLD IT WAS THERE AND IT WAS FREE YEPEEE
B00A12VW86|4.0|I have been a long time Green Day fan and this album is fun and great! If you like Uno, you'll love Dos!
B004QZA0QE|5.0|And even ought to be really interesting to anyone interested in the history of writing and formation/writing of books.<br /><br />I first read Frankenstein in college and was completely blown away by how poorly no movie had told the real story contained in this book. And now to be able to read Shelly's original and see her husband's editing - wonderful!<br /><br />A really insightful look into the process of editing a magnificent novel.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Just a simple calculator. It does what it should and gives you a decent calculator you can add where you need it?
B006SMLAMQ|1.0|This paid app has stopped updating the weather forecasts for the last 4 days making the app a HUGH waste of space.  After deleting a location I found adding a new location was also broken.  Deleting and reinstalling the app didn't fix these issues.
B00A3DZ61W|3.0|Not much new here.  Mostly repackaging with a couple of game play tweaks.  This &#34;game play franchise&#34; appears to be nearing the end of its run, as it now turns to emphasizing merchandising.
B002XXLKHY|5.0|My seven year old has watched this 3 times in the last 24 hours. Ok, that sounds like the TV is now the babysitter. Please remember. Gum on the street is NOT free candy. Great movie.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|The funniest Christmas movie ever. We watch it alot every holiday season! They don't make them like this anymore.. If your looking for a good laugh this is it.
B00A1U2SVS|5.0|Even after all these years, they still bring it!  I have listened to the album three times and, although different, it is still the very best!  How can you argue with perfection...Jason is as heavy handed and his father and fills in the way it should be....I am waiting on the DVD's which will really show how much fun this was for not just the performers but those who were lucky enough to attend!
B005LAIHZY|5.0|This was anoth great Disney movie. My kids love it. No matter how old you are or what gender, it has something for everyone..
0553381709|5.0|Skip the cheaper mass market paperbacks - you want this book, considering how long it takes to read. Pages stay open without holding, map is legible, larger text/spacing. ENJOY!
B005MVLI8A|5.0|What is there to say. You like Nirvana or you hate them. I happen to enjoy the music very much when I'm in the mood for it.
B009VB7QQA|5.0|We were really interested in watching this movie since it presented a different twist to history.  The movie did not disappoint and left us both in the grip of what would happen next.  This was a thoughfully constructed movie that my wife said was even better than the book.  We highly recommend Abrahmam Lincoln: Vampire Hunter to everyone interested in the vampire genre.
B0011BGY66|3.0|Hardly! Expecting some serious goth inspired vampish fun, I was instead transported to Jamaica. This isn't my favorite genre, but it is well performed and the songs are catchy. It's good music for a sunny day and a happy walk.
1609611543|5.0|This book was recommended by our family physician.  It was interesting, but don't think that we can stick to a wheat free diet.  Good read
B009G8GRX6|5.0|It had me at the first few notes and kept me throughout this theme album. The wonderful thing about this music is that it doesn't all sound alike, it doesn't have a great beat and is easy to dance to...no this one is for the discerning musician. It's multilayer music paired with surprise twists and intelligent, superb lyrics make it a must have the socially enlightened person. This isn't radio fare although a few would do well on the radio. I am amazingly surprised at how much I enjoy listening. Every time I discover something new. If you want happy, happy, this is probably not for you. If you want truth delivered in an enjoyable way although that truth may not be very happy...this is a great purchase.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|Can't wait to keep reading the series and see where it converges and differs from the show.  Great writing, story, characters, and art work.
B007U8UBGI|5.0|Very interesting mix of traditional bluesy songs and electronic music. Jack delivers some great vocals and his band performs wonderfully with some amazing harmonies. The songs are thoughtful and personal. In my opinion, this one is a definite keeper.
B000009VOL|5.0|Introspective, opaque, and underdeveloped are all qualifying adjectives to describe Moon Pix, the 1998 sadcore record by the American female troubadour Cat Power.<br /><br />Yet its the brilliant cohesion of its musical elements that manage to uplift the presented compositions to a higher level; the observational nature of the first person lyrical narratives (not afraid to throw in self-deprecating remarks for the sake of honesty), the minimal performances and production values that work by virtue of their absence, and most importantly the wrapping personality that enfolds Marshalls' own delivery are all fined tuned with each other.<br /><br />The well distributed set of tracks do not necessarily complement each other in terms of effectiveness, but they do work as a whole for the sake of mood balancing; songs like \\"Back of Your Head\\" and the trad cover \\"Moonshiner\\", for example, are nightmarish tales of emotional and mental turmoil which would be much harder to swallow without less brutal songs like \\"Colors And The Kids\\" and \\"Perking Saint\\" close within the track list, granted the mood is never optimistic throughout the album.<br /><br />Furthermore, a song like the aforementioned \\"Moonshiner\\" is an example where Marshalls' takes all the familiar elements of the music, strips them naked and makes it her own, and that's what makes Moon Pix so great; Cat Power may take familiar elements from say, Bill Callahan, or Elliot Smith, or even as far as Alanis Morissette, but at the end of the day she makes unique product of her own, which undoubtedly distinguishes her from her contemporaries.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|This book takes the reader into the mind of a woman who suffers from the same debilitating amnesia every time she awakens. Understanding how she manages her life with limited memory keeps the reader engaged.
B001FB55L2|4.0|The price was great and it was shipped in time to go under our Christmas tree even though it wasnt promised until Jan.
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|Such a cute movie. My son wanted to watch it over and over. I watched it again without him. But I always love disney movies. Great story for mothers and daughters too. My 3 year old son even got the story about the bond with your mother.
031606792X|5.0|This book got me laid more than anything ever has in the history of man for anyone else. I whack it a lot.
B004LROUNG|4.0|This was a fun read about what happens with some of the small law firms with just a bit of exaggeration.  Enjoyed the characters and the story.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|I love playing Bad Piggies, not as much as Angry Birds, but still fun and addicting game.  Would recommend to everyone.
B0089AD8IO|5.0|I'm still watching the first season disks and am having no problems with any of the disks so far. It is great to see the episodes I missed in the first season.
B001NCQSDM|5.0|I enjoy this for the nostalgia of when I was young. Three creative guys, three instruments. Huge sound. I still have my vinyl album!!!
B00AA7O22U|3.0|Bloodier than the first one.  Even with the big names, the acting was pretty poor.  Constant references to the movies that the others have been in, not necessary if you ask me.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|If you like John Corey, you will like this novel. There are more than a few &#34;loose ends&#34; when all is said and done, but Corey's sarcasm and wit are as sharp as ever.
B004SRNH10|3.0|A necessary program to run many applications on Android.  If, however, you don't have any applications that require this, don't download it -- it will just eat your battery and take up space that could be better utilized elsewhere.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Having had an experience myself that was \\"out of this reality\\", I found comfort in Dr. Alexander's book as it confirms what I already believe.
B0051UP5NQ|2.0|I downloaded this as an alternative to using Google Docs to open documents attached to email, but not once was this program able to open .docx, .pdf, .xlsx, etc. files.  That was the only reason I downloaded it, and it failed to perform.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I enjoyed reading about the WWII characters more then the people from the modern day angle of the story.<br />They seemed more believable and added more richness to the story. The main character, Laurel, was ok<br />but didn't seem to have much depth to her whereas Dorothy and Vivian's lives were filled with drama and<br />many challenges. I am referring this book to my book club because of the twist at the of the book. I feel we<br />will have a lot to discuss in reference to all the main characters.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|It was a good quick read, and once I started I couldnt put it down for a minute! I LOVED IT!!!!!
B003YFIUW8|4.0|Our book club read this book last month. Most of us really liked it but were surprised at the ending..<br />it seemed to come out of no where. The author did a great job of writing from the viewpoint of a<br />5 year old. It was not difficult to imagine the child's daily life in the Room. Kudos to his mother for<br />making the hours/days/months/years go by with such a structured routine. She made sure he<br />was able to converse above most 5 year olds. It was interesting to see what elements in his life were<br />missing (how to go down/up stairs and space relationships) Would recommend.
B009M8TA20|4.0|This book tells the story of Zlatan in an easy but also detailed way. The balance between football and family was good in my mind. There are also a lot of things that you can not read from many other sources if you're interested in European football.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Liked it a lot until I read some reviews.<br />I agree, the ending was weird. Didn't really like it but then decided it was<br />the only thing that could happen.<br />Some of the events were not plausible but if you don't think too hard about<br />them then it's an enjoyable read.<br />A lot of swearing.
B009VB97EY|1.0|After it was downloaded it would not open! Never got to watch the movie. Very dissapointed on my flight that I was not able to watch.
B000JMKTLO|2.0|I read this book after reading Gone Girl. I enjoyed the story line and writing style of Gone Girl and thought<br />another book by the same author would be a good read.<br />Disappointing and just plain weird. I wouldn't recommend it.
B00687PWQG|5.0|Was a great tool for helping my daughter understand the Revolutionary period while studying for a seventh grade social studies final exam.
1608871517|5.0|I WENT TO THE MUSEUM OF MICHAEL JACKSONS CLOTHES, IN PARIS, AND THEY WERE OUT OF THE BOOK, I CAME BACK HOME AND ordered IT RIGHT AWAY.......GOT IT MUCH LESS MONEY TOO...it was very interesting story the authur had to tell of his experences with working with michael ...hes right about michael was one of a kind and will be missed by millions..im very glad i  was able to get this book from you  thanks for having it sincerly ric
B009LROCJI|4.0|Some nice compositions.  Very Bach-like. Some are almost written like fugues, which I really enjoy.  Any fan of the Four Seasons is sure to find something they like here.  Recommended.
B006WQLH7G|5.0|Works fine, easy to configure with an intuitively designed interface.  Once installed it is easy to modify the options the way you want them to be
B00448SE4S|4.0|I'd actually resisted seeing Scott Pilgrim for a while just because people had told me it's a video game movie, and what came to mind are the previous horrible abortions that were video game movies; Super Mario Brothers, for example.  But this isn't a video game movie, it's a movie shot like it was a video game, and totally different.  Besides that, it's just a good movie, with a lot of good action, a well told story about life and, essentially, 'coming of age'/facing your past mistakes, and some good music to boot.<br /><br />Definitely worth a watch, even if you don't like video games or don't catch the subtle nods to 80's and 90's gaming trends and arcades.
B005LAIGZU|5.0|The action in this video is great and the live fire really added to the action protrayed by the actors and these real Amercian Heroes. The only easy day was yesterday!
B007THA4FI|5.0|I liked everything about it, including the non-Hollywoood ending.  Great writing, rich characters and interesting story.  A screenplay MUST be next!
B000EHSVSC|5.0|Gpod 2nd world war story. This is also the Japanese side of the story. Great movie. A must see for war lovers.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|interesting problems face the familiar medical examiner in the latest novel, but I found it somewhat disappointing compared to previous novels by Patricia Cornwell.  For me the details of Kay Scarpetta's  medical procedures and the usual supporting characters were just not at the usual high standards (& pace).  The story was intriguing, Kay is clever & smart as always, but I was left feeling let down.
B00007AJGH|5.0|It is a fantastic, hillarious movie. The actors in it were fantastic in their actions. The most funniest movie I have ever seen.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|an imitation of that many shades of grey theme, but done well! I really liked these characters, and can't wait to read more.
B000BNX4MC|5.0|This is a great classic movie. A must see. Funny movie. Great cast in the movie. Would never happen in real life.
B000BBOV8U|4.0|The music on the two cd set is awesome! Huge Bryan Adams fan.  In downloading the cd's to my computer,  it would not download all of the two cds.  It only downloaded a combination of the two, which was very disappointing.
B00000FZ1V|5.0|Funny, funny movie. Good cast....About what you would expect as to ghosts and goblins. Funny eradication of them. Good movie to watch.
B008P76UKE|5.0|It is amazing how well 16 hours of Wagner's Ring music was summarized in 80 minutes without losing the essence of the four operas. Musical motifs representing the characters and situations along the operas are well selected and follow the chronological order of the plot. The orchestra, the Lorin Maazel direction, the sound and images of the blu ray are impeccable. This musycal synthesis is recommended as an introduction to the Ring or just to hear when you are in a Wagner's mood and do not have the 16 hours required to hear the full and monumental Wagner work.
B00000F14B|5.0|A movie with the most fantastic cast. Superb band. A good comedy in the classic sense. A must see movie for kids.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|This app works very well and is needed for your Kindle Fire. One example, I downloaded a PDF (I hate PDF but we have to live with it). Kindle shows it under Downloads but I couldn't find it later. This app allowed me to move it from the downloads folder into the Documents folder. After restarting my Kindle the PDF now shows up on my Carousel.
B0009HKH6Q|5.0|This is a great movie. It has suspense, drama, good storyline, good cast. This was the first Thomas Crown Affair. The remake was with Pierce Brosnin.
B00124DSR0|5.0|It's been a while since I've heard these songs and it was a treat! I had forgotten how well they played the horns and how unique their music was. And the long guitar solos...
B00003CXCT|5.0|Had to have the classic Star Wars trilogy. Bought more for sentimental reasons than any other. Great classic movies. A must see.
B005JABSB6|4.0|You need these to see 3D TV, period. Two pairs came with the TV, but we frequently have guests, so we need more glasses. These are quality made. The battery has excellent life, and their choice of using a USB interface to charge the battery means I can plug one pair into the back of the Sharp flat panel TV, and multiple glasses into USB ports on PC's in the house.
6305511055|5.0|Wow! What a suspenseful movie. Good cast. Good story line. It could happen in real life too. A must see.

B005EHILV4|1.0|The features work as advertised, but the sound is so poor, you can't get anything useful out of it.<br /><br />When the device is plugged into USB, the audio always has some background hiss, regardless of whether or not something is plugged into it. The sound turns into something awful when it is plugged into the wall and you use the analog audio out. The only thing I could find is that the phantom power is the likely cause, but there is no way to turn that off.

141659521X|2.0|I bought this book trying to prove the other reviewers wrong...that perhaps they were just tired of another \\"Mitch Rapp\\" novel. Well, I was wrong, but I had to read through to the very end to prove to myself that I should have saved my money. The first four or five novels that the author wrote around Mitch Rapp were gripping and good. But like Sean Dillon, the \\"eternal\\" character in many of Jack Higgins books, Rapp will not go away...he may be shot or blown up or scorched or whatever...but he will not go away. It is for this reason I believe that 2 stars are generous enough for a tired old character that won't lay down and die. And by the way, I personally have had enough of the author's choice of sewer language for his characters. Like the Last Man, this will be the last book I but written by this author. I do not recommend it.

B001HBYHFA|5.0|This is a must-have for fans of the Firefly tv series.  It is the feature film that was made to tie-up the prematurely cancelled show.  The movie delivers on every level.  It is a great story and includes all of the original main characters.  Great action and a satisfying conclusion to the series.  It can be watched as a &#34;stand-alone,&#34; but viewers will get so much more out of the film by watching the Firefly series first.  Wish they made more action/sci-fi movies like this one.

B009LXEBD4|4.0|Kelly Clarkson has reached the point in an illustrious career where she can package her hits into her first greatest hits compilation. This compilation arrives via [[ASIN:B009LXEBD4 Greatest Hits-Chapter One]], a seventeen track/one disc collection.  Greatest Hits - Chapter One gets the whole 'compilation' thing right, nitpicking about what to include from each of Ms. Clarkson's five solo discs, as well as hit duet with Jason Aldean (\\"Don't You Wanna Stay\\" originally from [[ASIN:B0041GWWSC My Kinda Party]]) and some new songs (\\"Catch My Breath,\\" \\"People Like Us,\\" and \\"Don't Rush\\" featuring Vince Gill.  And no compilation would be complete without the holiday cut tacked on somewhere right? Clarkson's \\"I'll Be Home For Christmas\\" closes.  Since many have heard these selections, this review won't analyze production, songwriting etc., but will evaluate as a compilation.<br /><br />Clarkson's first album Thankful (2003) is represented by no. 9 Grammy-nominated hit  \\"Miss Independent\\" (Track 3) and no. 1 American Idol winning single \\"A Moment Like This\\" (Track 16).  These are the two most representative cuts of Clarkson's debut, so kudos to the choices made.  The Deluxe version tacks on \\"Beautiful Disaster\\" near the end, but ultimately disregards the excellent \\"Trouble With Love Is\\" and minor hit \\"Low.\\" Even so, \\"Miss Independent\\" and \\"A Moment Like This\\" are more definitive.<br /><br />Second album 2004's sextuple-platinum, 2x Grammy winning juggernaut [[ASIN:B00064ADRK Breakaway]] is the best represented effort, sporting no. 2 hit \\"Since U Been Gone\\" (track 1), no. 6 hit \\"Behind These Hazel Eyes\\" (track 5), no. 7 ballad \\"Because Of You\\" (track 6), no. 6 Avril Lavigne co-write \\"Breakaway\\" (track 10) and no. 12 \\"Walk Away\\" (track 12).  All five songs were huge hits at the time and represent the pop chanteuse at her very best. No quibbles here.<br /><br />Third album 2007's My December was Clarkson's miss. There was controversy all along the way between Clarkson and Clive Davis in regards to the tone and material featured on the album. While Clarkson failed to back down, sales weren't favorable and the sole hit was the dark no. 8 cut \\"Never Again.\\" The cut does make an appearance here (track 7), following \\"Because of You\\" and serving as a darker contrast to the somber ballad.<br /><br />Fourth album, 2009's 'comeback' [[ASIN:B001AQXJ9W All I Ever Wanted]] is represented by bubblegum sensible no. 1 \\"My Life Would Suck Without You\\" (track 2) and popular no. 13 hit \\"Already Gone\\" (track 8). \\"I Do Not Hook Up\\" only graces the deluxe edition.  While it's absence could scrutinized since it was a top 20 hit, it's absence is also justifiable.<br /><br />2011's [[ASIN:B005HQ5S3G Stronger (Deluxe Version)]] yields representation via no. 10 hit \\"Mr. Know It All\\" (no. 9) and no. 1 hit \\"Stronger (What Doesn't Kill You)\\" (track 4).  These are the two most notable cuts from Stronger, though \\"Dark Side\\" wouldn't have been questioned had it appeared.<br /><br />As for the rest, \\"Don't You Wanna Stay\\" is a sound choice (track 11) considering it was part of Jason Aldean's breakthrough and did hit the top 40. \\"Catch My Breath\\" (track 13) is a solid promo single, even if it isn't as strong as the juggernauts showcased on this compilation (produced by Sound Kollectiv) .  \\"People Like Us\\" (track 14)  finds Clarkson in solid voice against a driving pop production (produced by Greg Kurstin). \\"Don't Rush\\" (track 15) is certainly pleasant, with Vince Gill adding nice vocal harmonies to Clarkson's lead (produced by Dann Huff). Closing cut \\"I'll Be Home For Christmas\\" (track 17) is described as the iTunes Session Version, produced by Thuy-An Julien. Maybe its inclusion is odd, but Clarkson performs it extremely well if nothing else.<br /><br />All-in-all, there are no missteps on this compilation.  The standard version accomplishes the task of showcasing Clarkson's biggest hits while the Deluxe adds a few more notable pieces of her discography.  The new cuts don't propel Clarkson's star any loftier, but do find her in superb voice. Highly recommended for both the die-hard and casual Kelly Clarkson fan. 4 stars.'t propel Clarkson's star any loftier, but do find her in superb voice. Highly recommended for both the die-hard and casual Kelly Clarkson fan. 4 stars.

B009J2VR3Y|4.0|Ultimately, creating a 'greatest hits' compilation should be the easiest thing in the world. Unfortunately, the 'compilation' is one of the most messed up things that occurs in the music world.  The catch comes when you include versions other than the original that people have come to know and love and when you include bonus cuts/remixes that truly don't even tickle the die hard enthusiasts fancy.  That was the big rub with the two-disc [[ASIN:B00004R84V Whitney Houston - The Greatest Hits]]; it had too much fluff and omitted important pieces of Houston's illustrious career. 2012's [[ASIN:B009J2VR3Y I Will Always Love You: The Best Of Whitney Houston]] is stronger because of it's focus and the elimination of remixes that did not truly exemplify Houston's prodigious pipes. It also presents Houston's hits chronologically, something many greatest hits collections could benefit from. This reflection won't relay the superb nature of these timeless classics (everyone knows how great they are), but it will evaluate the soundness of this compilation and its epitomization of painting Houston as the the star that she was. This will be an album-by-album approach.<br /><br />1985's Whitney Houston is represented by no. 3 hit \\"You Give Good Love\\" (track 1), no. 1 hit \\"Saving All My Love\\" (track 2), no. 1 hit \\"How Will I Know\\" (track 3) and no. 1 ballad\\"Greatest Love Of All\\" (track 4).  Four extraordinary choices, producers get it right, presenting the four most notable cuts from Houston's debut and eliminating fluff.<br /><br />From 1987's Whitney, no. 1 hit \\"I Wanna Dance With Somebody (Who Loves Me)\\" (track 5), no. 1 ballad \\"Didn't We Almost Have It All\\" (track 6), no. 1 \\"So Emotional\\" (track 7), and no. 1 \\"Where Do Broken Hearts Go\\" (track 8) appear.  Another focused choice of four cuts, only no. 9 hit \\"Love Will Save The Day\\" ends up being omitted and that's justifiable given the focus of this particular set.<br /><br />1990's I'm Your Baby Tonight is generally considered one of Houston's weaker albums. That said, it still yielded two great no. 1s via \\"I'm Your Baby Tonight\\" and big-time ballad \\"All The Man I Need.\\" Both represent the album here as tracks 9 and 10.  There were other charting singles from I'm Your Baby Tonight (\\"Miracle\\" at no. 9 and \\"My Name Is Not Susan\\" at no. 20), but producers again hit the nail on the head with the most preeminent hits.<br /><br />After three studio albums, the soundtracks begin to take over, in chronological accordance of Houston's career. From 1992's Album of the Year winning [[ASIN:B000002VMD The Bodyguard: Original Soundtrack Album]], Houston's no. 1 interpretation of Dolly Parton's \\"I Will Always Love\\" enters in at track 11 proceeded by \\"I'm Every Woman\\" (track 12) and \\"I Have Nothing\\" (track 13).  These are the most notable choices and any of the three would have skeptics preaching.  The only somewhat questionable omission might be \\"Run To You.\\" That said, in the logic of this compilation, \\"Run To You\\" only managed to peak at no. 31, so its omission is by no means a 'game changer.' 1995's Waiting to Exhale soundtrack is represented by no. 1 \\"Exhale (Shoop Shoop)\\" (Track 14) while 1996's The Preacher's Wife is represented by no. 4 hit \\"I Believe In You And Me\\" (track 15).  No complaints here.<br /><br />1998's [[ASIN:B0026MOVO6 My Love Is Your Love]], arguably Houston's last 'blockbuster' studio effort, is represented by no. 4 hit \\"My Love Is Your Love\\" on track 16. This would be my biggest criticism. \\"It's Not Right, But It's Okay\\" gained more notoriety given its Grammy-win and presence as the 'voice' of that album; it also peaked at no. 4.  Additionally, \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\" peaked even higher at no. 2 and was a pretty big hit.  That said, neither of the three were 'classics' compared to say \\"Saving All My Love\\" or \\"I Will Always Love You.\\"<br /><br />Closing out the album are two 'bonus' cuts essentially - a re-recorded/duet version of \\"I Look To You\\" featuring its composer R. Kelly (track 17) and \\"Never Give Up\\" (track 18).  2002's Just Whitney is rightfully ignored, as is 2003's One Wish and 2009's I Look To You. The only argument to make toward 2009's I Look To You is omission of \\"I Look To You,\\" though that cut had little traction ultimately on the charts.<br /><br />Overall, this focused compilation gets things correct more often than not. My only major quibbles would be the failed omission of \\"One Moment In Time\\" (no. 5 hit) and perhaps the underrepresentation of 1998's My Love Is Your Love. Otherwise, there is little to knock. Highly recommended compilation for the late, great Whitney Houston.7) and \\"Never Give Up\\" (track 18).  2002's Just Whitney is rightfully ignored, as is 2003's One Wish and 2009's I Look To You.

B009LDXQGW|4.0|[[ASIN:B009LDXQGW Trilogy (Explicit)]] is a three-album compilation from Canadian R&B artist the Weeknd (Abel Tesfaye). The Weeknd's brand of R&B is very 'emo' by all means, dabbling in themes incurring both the sensual and substance use. The Weeknd's tenor is as 'sweet' as can be, perhaps most reminiscent to U.S.A. audiences to The-Dream. The three albums that compile the appropriately titled Trilogy are three previously freely distributed mixtapes released in 2011 - House of Balloons, Thursday, and Echoes of Silence respectively.  Each mixtape has had its respective nine tracks digital mastered and added a bonus track to compile Trilogy's three distinct, ten track discs.  At 30 tracks, The Trilogy is an abundance of material, though also a lot to digest in one setting.  Even so, The Weeknd helps to usher in new movements in R&B music and excels at killer ballads.<br /><br />The first disc of Trilogy is 'House of Balloons,' arguably the best. \\"High For This\\" sets the tone possessing a moody, 'stoner' vibe and exhibiting The Weeknd's bright, piercing tenor in all it's glory. \\"What You Need\\" epitomizes The Weeknd's lovy-dovy aspirations (\\"And I'mma love you girl, the way you need/ain't no one goin' to stop us...\\") while \\"House of Balloons/Glass Table Girls\\" serves up one of many solid 'double-tracks.'  On \\"The Morning,\\" The Weeknd continues to excel at his brand of overt-R&B, dropping the `obligatory' f-bombs  as well as the sensual.<br /><br />'House of Balloons' continues being cutting-edge on valedictory cut \\"Wicked Games,\\" nothing short of one of the more heart-wrenching R&B ballads in years (\\"Listen ma, I'll give you all I got/get me off of this, I need confidence in myself...\\") \\"The Party & The After Party\\" does the double-track in style, rivaling the quality of \\"Wicked Games\\" while \\"Coming Down\\" is literally about 'coming down' after drug-use.  \\"Loft Music\\" comes off a bit indulgent, while \\"The Knowing\\" insinuates reciprocated cheating.  \\"Twenty-Eight\\" closes the first disc in confessional fashion (\\"Baby if I knew you'd be living in my sheets/I wouldn't have shown you any love...\\")<br /><br />The second disc of Trilogy is The Weeknd's 'Thursday' mixtape plus bonus cut \\"Valerie.\\" \\"Lonely Star\\" continues to display The Weeknd's flawless falsetto and emo-lyrics (\\"Blaming all your sins on your best friends/and nothing's ever your fault...baby you don't need your best friends cause I got everything you want...\\").  \\"Life of the Party\\" again delves in to substance-inspiration while the title track of the disc \\"Thursday\\" is extremely odd-ball: \\"Not on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, but on Thursday...\\" \\"The Zone,\\" featuring Drake is the highlight of the second disc, featuring a sound vocal by The Weeknd and a solid verse from Drake: \\"Whoa, all these broken hearts on that...man if [...] dancing's an art you know many [...] artists I know?\\"<br /><br />\\"The Birds, Pt. 1\\" and \\"The Birds, Pt. 2\\" continues The Weeknd's sensual path in top-notch form while the substance use-infused \\"Gone\\" cites The Weeknd's name checks 'influences'.  \\"Rolling Stone\\" lacks the direction of the best cuts, but \\"Heaven Or Las Vegas\\" does a fine job of atoning, even if it possesses some `sacrilege': \\"they say they want heaven, they say they want God/I say I got heaven/Well I say, I am god.\\" Bonus cut \\"Valerie\\" closes the disc capably, particularly with more risqu&eacute;, though quite memorable lyrics.<br /><br />The final disc of Trilogy is 'Echoes of Silence.'  The Weeknd's opens the disc with \\"D.D.,\\" a cover of Michael Jackson's \\"Dirty Diana,\\" which he executes in incredibly capable fashion.  \\"Montreal\\" proceeds but doesn't ultimately captivate like \\"Outside\\" which follows, possessing the lushness of past contemporary R&B with the moodiness of modern, alt-R&B. \\"XO/The Host\\" does the double track as well as anything else, delivering more `direct' lyrics. 'The Host' portion of the song contrasts 'XO' by slowing the pace and drawing things out.<br /><br />\\"The Initiation\\" shows off The Weeknd's manic side while \\"Same Old Song\\" is easily one of the more commercial numbers of the album. Juicy J gets a guest spot with a rather pointless closing outro.  \\"The Fall\\" is a B+ cut while \\"Next\\" is an 'A' opening in foreboding fashion at the onset and buttressed with heavy drum programming. Title track \\"Echoes of Silence\\" is much more effective than \\"Thursday,\\" find The Weeknd taking his time executing the lyrics and allowing the audience to hinge on to his every word.  Closing bonus cut \\"Til Dawn (Here Comes The Sun)\\" feels like the weakest of the new cuts.<br /><br />All-in-all,  [[ASIN:B009LDXQGW Trilogy (Explicit)]] is a jam-packed effort.  There is both a healthy abundance of material as well as an overabundance of material.  The themes remain concrete and while there are overlaps, The Weeknd ultimately has no shortage of approaches to continually target and play on those themes.  Perhaps not quite the 'victory lap' of 2012 R&B releases such as Frank Ocean's [[ASIN:B008CJ0KI8 channel ORANGE]] or Miguel's [[ASIN:B008QZ9EC6 Kaleidoscope Dream]], it is still a great triumph for the continued existence of R&B. The Weeknd could, however,  tone down the language and be just as effective ultimately. Highly recommended and a steal for the price. 4 stars.ut.<br /><br />\\"The Initiation\\" shows off The Weeknd's manic side while \\"Same Old Song\\" is easily one of the more commercial numbers of the album.

B0085Z8F4A|5.0|I waited for DVD to see it and I wished I hadn't.  I should have known that through out film history a movie that has a lot of haters and lovers is good sign that's it's worth a watch. This is not a pop film. There's a great deal of symbolism that may leave many either not caring or lack the appreciation of the content.  The same could be said of Blade Runner, a film i hated as  a youth but loved once I got older. This film was exactly what I had hoped  it to be and had made it worthy of a purchase. I rarely buy films these days, but I will (after this review) buy Prometheus.

B0050BPIB0|5.0|What a singer, this guy's music is amazing. I bought this CD after listening to his songs on Youtube and it is worth the money. I recommend his music to all my friends who are like me learning Spanish at college. He has great lyrics and an awesome voice. Overall great singer.
B0067RQYNW|5.0|its the full version. its free. you can create spreadsheets with working formulas. you can create docs. reminds me of a mini Excel.<br /><br />its worth having on your device.<br /><br />i am using tge kindle fire hd
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I have a 47 year old mother, a 49 year old father, a 24 year old sister, a 16 year old brother, a 4 year old neice, and me. My mother enjoyed playing this on her kindle. My father didn't really play. He's not the video game type. My sister liked helping and playing every now and then and on our trip to Connecticut. My brother would play if I let him, (He-he) when he got bored. My neice LOVED playing with Auntie's Kindle Fire. It was one of only a few things that would keep her content on our trip, especially since it took longer than expected. As for me, it is one of the better apps out there. Not a scam, a true app that Nordcurrent Ltd took there time on for our sole enjoyment and entertainment. Have a nice day. :) ( Review by Ginny :) )
B0098VXBIA|5.0|So funny! I loved everything about this movie! I definitely recommend renting this movie! Great for girls night with a bottle of wine!
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|Having never read any of the books but hearing raves about the movie, I thought we would watch this one.  It was entertaining and we enjoyed watching it.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Love this show and the fact Amazon has it ready for me to watch so quick.  This show gets better every season!
0525425764|4.0|I bought this for my Grandson.  He loved the other books in the series so I bought this to give to him for Chrstmas.
1594744769|4.0|This book was not at all what I expected.  However, it was rather good.  I enjoyed the story as well as the writing.  There were a couple predictable plot elements, but all in all it was enjoyable and good.  It was not a difficult read, either.  I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys light reading.  There is an underlying element of sci-fy without being Dr. Who level as well as light a light romantic plot element.  In addition, there are a few things which are downright creepy.  But, not in a terribly gruesome way - just spine-tingly creepy.
B0000AUHPK|5.0|I have watched many versions and think this is by far the best.<br />The book isn't nearly as enjoyable as watching Ralph & Juliette.
B0095R76EW|1.0|Way too long and many tired old jokes, not sure why Emily Blunt would want to do this movie. It just wasn't the least bit funny.
1938469003|5.0|I had heard a lot about this book on podcast and was excited to read it. It reads like a good book, mostly explaining the history and style of what an IPA is and is not.  The history of this style of beer is really fascinating.  Best of all, this book provides a ton of great recipes for famous IPAs.  My only complaint is that the recipes are given in percentages, rather than the typical 5 gallon homebrew size.  Given some brew software, that is easily calculated though.<br /><br />If you want the real story of IPAs and want some killer recipes to go with it, get this book right away. The author is one of the definitive sources on this style for the modern age.
B009VB7P6G|5.0|We loved this - even our 6 year old son.  This was a sweet and funny movie - great for family movie night!
030758836X|5.0|I haven't finished this yet but I'm addicted to it. The characters are well developed and there are plenty of twists & turns. Very hip.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love this game. It is just plain fun. It is hard to win it but it is fun trying.
B009YX02T8|4.0|Just like all of the other Soundtracks for this series, it took some warming up to get used to it.  It really helped once I saw the movie though.  Having seen the movie, I can now relate the songs to their various scenes, which is always fun!  Recommend for the TwiHards!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love the game of solitaire and it is nice to have it on my Kindle so I can play it anytime. I tend to cheat at the game and this keeps me honest.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Great case at a great price! No reason to spend twice as much.<br /><br />Very lightweight yet still protects the device sufficiently.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Excellent game with a bit of a twist. If you liked AB Space, this will add another dimension of difficulty.
B009NQKXYK|3.0|Overall the FX were good, but, the acting and story were a bit weak - I must say that the ending was rather predictable and silly.
B009GEAPYW|3.0|I was really excited to see some of Frank Miller's art in motion. I expected a mix of the comic, the style of the Watchmen animated movie, and the coolness of the Sin City movie. But I was disappointed. The atmospere just wasn't there. The art was re-worked, not Miller's. The edge was lost. The original comic had scenes that are burned into my brain, but the movie failed to capture the pacing. I think that's the most disappointing - the pacing. It moves too fast and doesn't let you reflect on the gravity of each scene. Maybe they'll rework it for part two?
0525423656|5.0|After the events of Matched, Cassia and Ky have been separated. Cassia is on work detail planning her attempt to find Ky who has been sent to the Outer Provinces. Deemed and Aberration by the Society, Ky has no chance of returning and Cassia knows that this is her only chance to find him once again. Armed with a compass and the blue tablets stolen for her by her best friend, Xander, Cassia plans to make her way to the Outer Provinces by herself. She's prepared for a rough journey but before she can leave, the Society steps in. Cassia and a group of other girls are being sent to the Outer Provinces. The Society has been shipping people to the area on a regular basis, using them as bait in hopes that the enemy will believe the Provinces are still heavily settled. In truth, the people sent there don't last long. When Cassia arrives, she discovers that Ky has already made his own escape, into the nearby canyons. This area was once Ky's home and he knows it well, but can Cassia survive long enough to be reunited with him?<br /><br />CROSSED alternates chapters between Cassia and Ky, telling the story from their perspectives. It's an interesting tactic that's effective here because both characters have very different backgrounds and, therefore, very different reactions to each of the challenges they face.<br /><br />The history of the Society is touched on in further detail as well, but their motivations are still something of a mystery. What's more, the element of the Rising is added here and Ky in particular makes the reader question just who is actually the good guy.<br /><br />I love this series! So much intensity, such great world building, and the creepy dystopian Society! I read CROSSED in one afternoon and almost immediately started reading REACHED.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I've read all of Grisham's books.  This one had a very interesting, complicated plot.  I'm reading it again just to sort it all out.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I really enjoyed this book a lot.  I did not especially like the ending but all in all well worthwhile reading it.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I love how deep and intense Brody is, Damien Lewis is perfect for the role.  Wow, you can just about read his mind when he's in a jam.  Carrie, she's perfect.  No one could portray her better than Claire Danes, she's awsome.  And Dana, Brody's daughter is the best actress.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|this was a great episode.  I liked the information on the characters they are getting more in depth. Cant wait to see what is planned for the next episodes.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this app works great I have never had any problems with it, it is just a calculator though,  I mean it is not that hard to make a great calculor in my book! but it has always worked fine and gotten the right answer so I guess that I would say that it is overall a pretty good app.
B00009V7P8|5.0|Would absolutely recommend this CD! Damien Rice is not as well known as most top 20 artists but his music is very enjoyable
B000JMKRKC|5.0|For those who appreciate the basics: engaging story line, changing point of view, well developed characters and a finely crafted novel..this is the book for you.
B000002IQ9|5.0|Would totally recommend this CD to 80's music fans or anyone who likes Phil Collins. Great compilation of his music!
B00A3DZ61W|4.0|I would like to rate this but for some reason after installing it on my Android 2.2 tablet; when I click the icon a dark screen is displyed then it goes back to my tablet desktop. The program never initializes.
B00181JGI2|3.0|this movie makes me want to drink White Russians more than it makes me want to laugh. it's worth seeing but man do people over hype this move. rent don't buy.
B002Z58GQI|4.0|The product has performed without any problems. I have used it for backup and transfer of files. I would buy this product again.
0374275637|4.0|interesting book, but sometimes I think the author assumes too much from the research done.  DID you KNOW THAT AMAZON.COM is a real headache to work with?  I BOUGHT AN EBOOK AND YOU CAN't read about 30% of the content because it is tables and charts, and all they want to DO IS BLAME THE PUBLISHER>  THEY WILL WASTE YOUR TIME and make you feel like it is your fault--BEWARE>>>DON'T BUY EBOOKS FROM THEM!!!!!!!!! The book was Universal Principles of Successful Trading, but I think it may apply to many more books than this!!!!!!!!!! BEWARE!!!
0545128285|5.0|Perfect companion to the J. K. Rowling series. Look forward to my kids enjoying their very Potter Christmas this year.
1451620829|5.0|What a great book ! Hi highly recommend !! Good dirt on the 2 real dopes of the band !! (Paul & gene)
B00003CXC7|2.0|This is one of Hitchcock's finest suspense dramas and truly delivers in terms of glamour, bravery and suspense, however the condition of the CD was not at its finest. The CD stops and starts at multiple times throughout its viewing and despite wiping it and changing DVD players, it continues to have this problem. In future, would seller please verify that the product is in viewable condition.
0547884591|5.0|I already own the 4-Hour Body and love it so I was SUPER excited for the 4-Hour Chef. I got my copy last Wednesday and finished reading through it last night. Now I can't wait to start over and get hands on this time. I love Tim's writing style. It's as though I'm listening to a great friend explain a process rather than read a bunch of boring instructions. I also absolutely love all the pictures. I highly recommend this book even if you're only going to flip through it and not read straight through it as I did. Now I just need Tim to publish a similar book on gardening :)
B000SEGUDE|5.0|The smoothness in which the sections transition, the connectivity between them tenuous and fragile, the progression of pacing and the lulls that are a product of its structure -- I'm hugely impressed with this novel.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|Enjoyed the game very much. Back in the true Angry Bird fashion! I have liked all of the Angry Bird games except Bad Piggies. The only problem I have with it is the fact that they show more worlds that you can't get to unless you purchase them. I think, once you buy a game, you should get the whole thing.
B0010T3UV6|3.0|I am working at the kitchen. I love crocs cause so light and good fit on me.<br />but it's very slippery especially with a lot of water on the floor.<br />I would try other brand of shoes next time.
B0080SZ0V8|1.0|I was soo into this game and now it froze up and not allowing to continue! I hate when this happens! please fix, very disappointing. Playing on kindle fire.
B004SGWYW4|5.0|Truly an epic journey watching it... the cast and characters were awsome and the graphics were beautifully detailed. I recommend this to any one who loves zombies and girls and anime mixed!
B009KHDT0C|3.0|It was okay, I won't waste my time watching it again. Unfortunately, they showed all the good parts in the preview.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am not a big television watcher, not many interesting shows. This is an incredible show. I am waiting for season 4.
1439152802|4.0|Laurel's idyllic home life is shattered on the day that she sees her mother kill a man on their front driveway from her hiding place in the tree house. The police are called, investigations are pursued and it's agreed all around that the man had been a stalker terrorising the neighbourhood and that Dorothy Nicolson acted in self-defence. But it was only later after the police have gone that Laurel realises something: the man had addressed her mother by her name. Who was he? What was the secret which was so terrible that Dorothy would rather kill than have it come to light?<br /><br />Now in her sixties, Laurel's mother is dying and Laurel is determined to find out the truth about her mother's past, even if that means finding out things she'd rather not know. The book veers between Laurel's investigations in the present, seeking out the help of her brother Gerry, a scatter-brained scientist (a clich&eacute; I thought had died out years ago) and the past lives of three people who were intertwined in the past: Dorothy, Jimmy and Vivien. The book takes us from 1920s Australia, to England in the 1930s and 1940s, including the second world war.<br /><br />I have to say the parts with Laurel investigating things fell almost flat for me; it was as if she wasn't a character in her own right, but just there to piece all of the puzzle together. Parts of it were a bit long and rambling without really going anywhere, I think it could have been a third shorter and still would have made a good book.<br /><br />I enjoyed the parts about wartime London, everything was brought vividly to life but without it becoming a history lesson, from the nightly air-raids to the food rationing.<br /><br />There is a twist at the end I didn't see coming, which was a nice surprise, but a lot of things felt a bit contrived, such as Laurel finding letters or journals that explained a lot of the things she was trying to find out. I don't think things would have worked out that tidily in real life.<br /><br />The writing is mostly good, with the author having some good turns of phrase. She's got a good ear for dialogue and finding out what the secrets were kept you guessing right till the end.<br /><br />It's a good book, but with a bit of trimming, it could have been better.<br /><br />Review copy from Netgalley./>The writing is mostly good, with the author having some good turns of phrase.

B003G4W49C|5.0|This book is one that will one day be considered classic literature. The thought provoking nature lends to card‘s mastery of writing.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator is the easiest to use that I have found. I think this sums my opinion up on this calculator.
B009LROCJI|5.0|&#34;Recomposed&#34; is not &#34;The Four Seasons,&#34; nor is it meant to be.  If you can embrace this fact, you will likely enjoy this album.  Richter has lifted -- sometimes heavily, sometimes not -- from Vivaldi's grand work and made it his own.  It is a fun, rewarding listen.
B00881PPTO|5.0|Can't believe all the negative reviews based on permissions that are identical to the free version getting 4.5 stars.  5 stars as a great app with ads is now better with no ads! Thanks Amazon!
B008ZOHCKE|2.0|Although this had good reviews, I don't find it easy to use and will probably delete it.  It isn't easy to scroll between the notebooks.
B000WTBMBU|5.0|I really loved the fact that after all this time of procrastinating about this intelligently crafted album came to me in rapid fashion. All from the inquiry, down to receiving my package, there was nothing but professionalism.<br />Impressed, and grateful.<br />-Shinobi 009
0375869026|5.0|I started this book last night and planned to read a couple of chapters before going to sleep.  Well...instead of lulling me to sleep this book was so interesting and engaging that I stayed up late to finish it.  I loved it!  Most of my books are borrowed from the library, but this is a book I plan on purchasing not just for my family but for my entire class.  Yes, it is that good.  As a teacher I can tell you that the voices of the characters were 100% authentic and natural.  If you have a reluctant reader I think that this book will definitely capture not only their interest, but their hearts.  Wonder is truly wonderful.
B001BKTEZA|4.0|Very interesting and compelling.  Much of it is based on the notes of a lady who actually lived through this experience and happened to run into Steinbeck and shared her notes with him.  Her own book was not published until 2002 a year before she passed away.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I like using this game as mindless fun to unwind after a long day. not so hard that its frustrating, good for a non-gamer like me.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Very well written and compelling.  Well researched and has interesting historical trivia and facts mixed into this WWI era story with the fictional characters sharing space with real historical figures.  These characters are very well drawn.  Very enjoyable book.  Book one of a trilogy and I will be looking for the next two books, which may already be available.
B0015XASFS|5.0|Josh Groban has the smoothest voice. He is the reason why I now listen to classical pop music. This makes other music styles so much more enjoyable because it breaks up the monotony of only listening to pop rock. I now have a deeper appreciation for my other favorite music artists.
B004KZOWEG|5.0|Well written and obviously well researched.  This gives a whole new(for me) view of colonization which in Africa was pure exploitation to the nth degree and then some.  Good historical account and an interesting read.
B007L3BMGA|3.0|THIS BOOK SHOULD BE COMPULSORY READING FOR ALL PEOPLE INVOLVED WITH &#34;MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES&#34;<br />AS A WARNING ON IMMATURE SEX
B0064T6LV8|5.0|ok like my dad loves this game he was the person who showed me this game and then I ended up playing it all the time with him so I hope u.like this game as much as I do bye l8r everyone.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|While i am not a big fan of romance novels, I will occasionally read one for a quick diversion.  I was a big fan of &#34;the Notebook&#34; by Sparks, but had not read any others. This one has no surprises and I was reminded of another novel that had similar overtones, &#34;Sleeping with the Enemy&#34; which I liked better.  But don't let me discourage you from reading this,; it still keeps your attention in a predictable manner.
B0059XTUB8|5.0|I saw it in the movie theater. The gal nailed it. She was Marilyn,in my opinion.<br />I've been a MM fan for many years. Watched her movies.<br />The mannerisms were studied well and conveyed to the silver<br />screen flawlessly. I loved this movie and just ordered the DVD<br />to add to my Marilyn collection.Two thumbs up for this flick.<br />The primary actors were all marvelous at portraying Marilyn's<br />troubled times with her personal and professional life.<br />I highly recommend this film as an accurate depiction of<br />the onset of her demise.
B0086449YA|4.0|I like those soft songs....so slow... so nice....and the choice of interesting music instruments make this album great.... i am very happy to listen again to the beautiful music of Mark Knopfler...... of course you have to understand also that i am of his generation.....
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I want to download it but I have it free and its REALLY REALLY FUN.I'm not sure if I will get it but its really fun
B0000E1ALR|4.0|i like it so much......down by the river.....i could listen to it so many time....those records give us a broad perspective on the work of this great American singer.....
B0046B1KHG|5.0|This is my grandson's favorite movie, we've seen this uncountable times.  Now that I downloaded if to my Kindle, he can watch it anywhere!!!
B008RTE08E|1.0|It's every bit the piece of crap I knew it to be but I had to have it anyway.  Fortunately, this is the only real piece of junk they produced so everything else is great.  Buy it if you must but know what you're getting.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|II have a hard time sleeping, got the free app and love all the sounds. I play it at night to help me sleep.  I have now uploaded the full version.
0525953728|5.0|THIS BOOK WAS VERY WELL WRITTEN AND I LOVE EVERY MINUTE OF IT. PS<br /> MY WIFE THOUGHT IT WAS VERY COOL.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|wow best app ever right away I got on it I finished I think because I deleted. this app hmmmmm<br /><br />wonderful
0525953728|5.0|Book was ok. Very uninformative.  Didn't feel connected with the author or his experience.  Hope he starts feeling well soon
B00371V6SE|5.0|I believe the movie is faithful to the book, they are equal in atmosphere, emotion, character arch and tension. Really great.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|Cute movie, but wasn't about what I thought from the previews.  It is a great family friendly movie with quality animation.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|It's a fun, mindless time waster for those moments when you just don't wanna do anything you're supposed to be doing!
B007FEFLTO|1.0|I would love to read this book, but at this price it seems like Amazon is taking advantage of its' custmers by charging all the traffic will bear.<br />Well, I'll wait until the price comes down, this is ridiculous!!!
B0042VJ1PI|4.0|Nikki Heat is on the hunt for the murderer of gossip writer, Cassidy Towne, who just finished a tell-all novel.  As she enters the crime scene, she finds her old boyfriend, Jameson Rook, waiting for her. Working together, they discover that the recently deceased made several enemies from her column. Could one of these exposed celebrities ultimately threaten Nikki's life to salvage his/her career? This adult crime novel has great characters that are reminiscent of other superb tales. Wonderful action scenes and romantic interludes add to the plot-twisting story line. I love the TV show and the book reminds me of it. The only drawback: the first few chapters are slow. This one is good for anyone who loves a mystery.
B003Y5HWJU|5.0|I have the same problem with this set of Homeland DVD's as the last &#34;playback prohibited by area limitations&#34;.<br />I have reported the problem and there has been no action taken. I am very disappointed.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|After reading this in two days i had to get the next book. Had to read the rest the same week couldn't wait to get more of this series.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I have been studying what sugar does to the body when we over eat and now the wheat, so it only made sense why I lost so much weight especially around my waist and fanny when I gave up wheat 2 years ago.  Relating wheat to the glycemic index just like the sugar - so why eat it?  Now I have learned more about the inflammatory process in the body and how it increases risks of so many of the major diseases like cardiovascular and diabetes.  Thanks to all the research done on celiac disease we now know more about the bodies response to the modified wheat.  I am so glad I read this book and hope Dr. Davis keeps the information coming.  it will help me help others in wellness coaching and gives me another reason not to eat wheat along with added sugar.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|...but it was a great ending, loved how we got to see what happened to all of the main characters.
B007TMON8M|3.0|I was not able to play through the entire game, I could not keep constructions under cost.  It is fun but difficult to play.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Read this in one day, the day after finishing hunger games. Glad i read it before the rest of the movies came out.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|easy to read, and pretty easy to relate to. I'll be interesting to see how the movie goes along with the book.
B0091XIZO0|1.0|The CD was defective.  Only four tracks worked.  All the others came up null.  I could not appreciate Lang Lang`s artistry.<br /><br />I saw him in concert two weeks ago and he was excellent<br /><br />Of course, I am returning the CD.
B000AMJC2K|5.0|I have a twenty four inch LED monitor and it works very well.  It is very easy to use and stays where it is put.<br /><br />***Update***<br />Still going strong, works  fantastic. 11-5-2013
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|We had this movie DVR'd for my 3 year old son.If he didn't watch it I sure would.This movie os great for any age.It's Steve Carell,you can't lose.
1401230423|5.0|The series just gets better as it finds itself. The many layers of the stories add to the experience and are not at all confusing. Much better written than the usual comic book.
B008PWUYVA|3.0|This isnt a bad case, and it looks really good. But unlike other timbuk2 products, this one seems to be a totally different animal. I wouldnt be shocked if it were even manufactured in their same shops. The material feels plasticy and cheap. Not their usual ballistic nylon. Some of the stitching is coming out. That being said the stand is a neat feature, and the lack of padding allows it to maintain a very svelte profile. I suspect whether or not you like the faux leather is a personal preference, but just be warned its a very different timbuk2 product, compared to their normally over built stuff. For the price I would expect a little more.
0061906220|5.0|This is one of my favorite children's book I read it to classrooms all the time. Children<br />N enjoy singing a long.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|Light fun read. Great characters and interesting plot. Cleverly written! Id recommend this to anyone looking for a good story with unexpected twists and turns
B002HML6Y8|5.0|If you are a fan of Stephen Summer movies (eg The Mummy), you'll enjoy this.  It's fun, light hearted and fast moving.  Hugh Jackman is fun to watch as he goes through he journey in this film.<br /><br />I think the negative reviews came from those who wanted a more serious film or something with more content.  I hope this review helps a bit!
0307730697|5.0|I really liked the book, but it was very emotional for me.  The story is written very well.  It had my interest from the beginning.
B002HR1W1K|5.0|This is simply a movie you must see.  Whether or not you like Simon Pegg movies (and btw, I dislikes Shaun of the Dead), you will enjoy this movie!  The plot is great and moves quite fast. The acting and humor are exceptional and I still love watching this movie after all these years.<br /><br />Not much more to add as there are plenty of opinions here, but I hope you see this movie!
B002MFX0RQ|5.0|Love everything about this movie!!! Ordered it for my daughter, it's her favorite Jimmy Stewart movie, and that's saying a lot!
B005H0IW6W|5.0|I agree with the majority of reviewers here..this record is pretty great. His voice just works with these songs and helps to create a new idea of what christmas songs should sound like.  I used to only enjoy the classic version of these songs (like those sang by Bing Crosby, Nat King Cole, etc), but I've got to say, that Michael Buble has done an amazing job here.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This one makes you think a little differntly than the typical game.  Seems you use a different part of the brain to complete each level...  Good time killer
B005LAIH3G|5.0|Having never heard of John Carter of Mars, or knowing the premise of the film, I watched the movie with little expectations.  I have to say I was pretty blown away by the special effects, and sheer visual presentation of the movie.  They do a great job of producing scale in the movie so that the environments seem truly grand (as they should be!).<br /><br />Anyway, enough people here have talked about the plots.  I just wanted to add that I think this is a great movie for the entire family.  I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|I love the case, I had one before and lost it...but durable and pretty good..i went underwater for hour and a half with my phone and when i opened it up, there was no leaks...I like that i can stand in the rain with it and i dont have to worry its been almost 3 months and i love it.
B0018QCXH8|4.0|I've got to say that the acting in this movie was pretty great.  The characters developed were powerful, believable and demanded audience attention.<br /><br />I don't want to add much here since there are so many reviews...but if you are a fan of Daniel Day Lewis, you will certainly enjoy this movie.<br /><br />One note..if you have a good sound system, I'd suggest pushing the bass up for this one. The sound is absolutely amazing throughout the entire movie.  If you listen carefully, the background music is exteremely visceral...to the point where you can feel the chatter in your teeth.  It all adds to the ambiance and the feel you're supposed to get from this experience.
B008YWY0HK|1.0|I am a fan of Pixar movies.  All of them have been anywhere from very good to masterpiece level...until Brave.  This movie can only be described as despicable.  It is rated PG, but it might as well be PG-13, as it should not be shown to any children under 12 (or actually no one under the age of 30 should see this movie).  The only good part about this movie is the beautiful cinematography, but otherwise its trash:<br /><br />1. The movie simply advocates for a radical sort of rebellion by a teenage girl.  Yes, supposedly she is sorry and remorseful, but if that is so then why does everything go her way at the end anyway, and she changes her mother like she wanted to in the first place.  Come on teenage girls, rebel against your mother as best you can, then cry when you nearly destroy your family and then your family will do what you wanted them to do in the first place.  This movie is a recipe for disaster in any family.<br /><br />2. The is a dream movie for ultra-feminists.  Not the true feminists who want equality and opportunity for women, but the ones who feel the presence of males is superfluous, and women can do everything themselves without any males being present.  They do everything right while the men and boys are no better than a bunch of monkeys (sorry if I insult any monkeys for comparing them with the male characters in this cartoon).<br /><br />3. The violence of this movie is way beyond anything children should see.  I guess with kids these days exposed to violent video games and movies without parental supervision, this movie may be not a shocker, but for any normal kid living a normal kid's life, this will simply bring your boy or girl nightmares.<br /><br />4. The theme of this movie is:  get rid of any traditions and set your own path.  Freedom, finding your own love, no input from mother or family, that's the way a girl should act.  Then if you end up in poverty with 3 kids from 3 different boyfriends, that's alright, you made your own decisions, or paraphrasing the cartoon, you have set your own fate (and set the fate of your family towards certain disaster).<br /><br />5. This is the closest a cartoon has ever gotten to being a form of child abuse.  It can only confuse good kids and make not-so good kids believe that their overbearing mother and stupid father are the cause of all their problems.  The supposedly redeaming quality of the ending again would only make sense if the girl would actually make the right decision in the end and listen to what her parents asked her to do.  But essentially nowhere in the movie does the daughter listen to her parent's commands, from beginning to end.<br /><br />6.  Some have commented on the crass humor and inappropriate images, but these are the least of the problems of this movie.  The violence and the radical propaganda are what make this movie a piece of garbage.<br /><br />Shame on you Pixar, you have completely lost your senses and the respect of this former fan of yours.
