B00FRQ32N4|4.0|Overall I'm satisfied with the game. One thing I wish was different is that we could create our own bots. Save up money buy parts n upgrade your own bot. Things that you use gold for are a little outrages on prices. I like the game though.
B005MMY9A8|5.0|Good movie, but would be more enjoyable if the control bar at the bottom would disappear like in other videos when in full screen mode.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Works just like a regular calculator.  Great app for any tablet or kindle product.  Works just fine for me and mom
1937053571|5.0|Sentinel is the final installment of the Covenant series, and it picks up right where Apollyon left off. While I liked Apollyon, it was my least favorite book of the series. I've also recently finished a couple of other series and was underwhelmed by how they ended. So going into Sentinel, I was a bit nervous that my hopes and expectations would be disappointed, especially since this is the first time I'm able to see how Armentrout ends a series. Fortunately, my fears were for not. I loved this book and it confirmed why I love this entire series.<br /><br />To be spoiler-free, I will be vague in my review. But if you have been a fan of this series, you know what to expect. We get our snarky, witty banter. Humor appears alongside our more serious moments, giving the complete spectrum of emotion. We get the beautiful love between Aiden and Alex. The strength of Alex and Aiden's love was clear and apparent, never in question or jeopardy. Gotta love Aiden! We are revisited by some previous characters and are even introduced to a few new ones. And yes, we get more Seth! The action continually progressed without any of those dull dragging moments. With the plot progression, we continue on the road of twists and turns, with many unexpected moments that left me guessing until the end. There are strong themes of forgiveness, redemption, sacrifice, honor, duty, friendship, and love.<br /><br />My only complaint: This could have used one more go through with editing. The great thing about Armentrout is that she can write a fantastic novel and write it quickly, which means these books get to the readers' hands more quickly, making us very happy. However, both she and her editor should be a bit more cautious before hitting the publish button.<br /><br />Bottomline: The Covenant series is one of my favorite series, and Sentinel did not disappoint. This ended perfectly for me and left me guessing and wondering until the end. If you like captivating characters, action-packed adventure, snarky and witty dialogue, and twists and turns that leave you excited for more, than I highly recommend this series.ure, snarky and witty dialogue, and twists and turns that leave you excited for more, than I highly recommend this series.

B00B3MN65K|1.0|Didn't like it at all. Not impressed. Worst of his work. Wish I would not have bought it. Wasted money!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I read everything John Grisham writes, and this book did not disappoint.  It was a riveting read as usual.  Highly recommend.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Well I like this game and the princess bride is not responsible for the next few days ago in a way to get the next few weeks back in the princess and the other hand and the next few years old man in his book is the princess of three today's New York Times and the next day and age group that is therefore you can see the next few days ago by a way.
B00EY7LT9Q|5.0|Protecting the ordinary from the extraordinary, that is the mission of the Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. Phil Coulson Nick Fury's &#34;One Good Eye&#34; is back after seemingly perishing at the hands of Loki before the Battle of New York (in The Avengers). On the mend, Coulson is given full autonomy to choose his own team and cases. Cases that will open up a brave new world for Coulson and his team.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Grisham outdid himself linking the early days of &#34;Time to Kill&#34; with his latest book.  A great, realistic plot, riveting twists and turns and lots of humanity.  A great read

B008JFUPK8|5.0|This movie is great. It's a great story line, the actors are great, the soundtrack is great, the cinematography is great! It's all great! Watch it on Blu-Ray with a surround system and you will love it.
B00EQ30RVY|3.0|This record was a long time coming. The politics between the band and Scott Weiland. Scott wanted to tour the first two albums twenty years later to cash in. the rest of the band wanted to record new material. The first song &#34;Out Of Time,&#34; was actually recorded with Scott. Chester Bennington grew up a huge STP fan. He brings a stage presence to get people to show up at shows. I saw them live in 2001 Linkin Park, Staind, and a few others opened for the original Stone Temple Pilots. The Family Values Tour. Chester came onstage during the song Meatplow and said in tears that he always dreamed of sharing a stage with them Picture Mark Wahlberg in the movie Rock Star. This 5 song EP was rushed. It was all politics. STP cannot use Atlantic Records without Scott Weiland. Hence they cannot work with Brendan O'Brien who refused upon listening to this drivel. The first two songs, and the 4th Chester tries to croon Scott's voice either out of respect or to give an STP vibe. The third song Same In The Inside was a surprisingly good song. Party because Chester does his own voice. Kudos to the band for  doing their own thing and producing new music. Problem is its not STP music. Chester is still signed with two other bands. 5 songs rushed at a studio is not fair to fans. The final song, &#34;Tomorrow,&#34; is the only other good song and sounds very much like an STP song. Maybe if they worked on a different vocalist sound like 40% of this album I could enjoy it. Instead it sounds like a cover band. Not worth a dime. Listen to the 22 minute EP on youtube. I guarantee you will not listen twice. You don't have to agree with me but I am just adding some inside information. Already reports of Weiland getting with the other three to record new material. Nobody wants the lawsuit. As I said kudos to the DeLeo brothers, and Kretz for putting up with Scott, and attempting to move forward. Unfortunately they only sound good together. I have no reason to defend Scott who performs drunk as well as sleep deprived after years of playing high.nk as well as sleep deprived after years of playing high.

B00CUWWLWG|1.0|The game won't even open on my kindle, it just starts to load then shuts down. On my iPhone the max nectar and seeds reduced to 4000 even though I was on level 45. Now I can't play the game because I can't make any progress. Both happened as soon as I made an in-app purchase for the game. I reported to gameloft but it has been six months and they still have not fixed and will not refund my money.
B008KHG2K2|5.0|This was exactly what it seemed on the website, and exactly what my brother wanted for his birthday and to continue with his collection.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|John Grisham is back!  This book or maybe it's the character, Jake Brigance, takes you back to Grisham's earliest work.  This is one of the best books ever.  I found myself in tears at the end.  When a book can move one like that, you know it is one that you will always remember.
B00DYEN6XC|5.0|I saw Man of Steel at my local theater when it came out back in June and I loved it. It has all of the action and adventure you could want or ask for in a comic book movie and it also has a very emotional scene as well involving Jonathan Kent and Clark Kent. This movie kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time from start to finish. I saw it first on June 13th 2013 as part of the WalMart advanced screening the movie itself wasn't released until June 14th 2013. I saw it first in 2D then again a week later in Real D 3D format. I am also a huge collector of all things Superman and this limited edition 2 figure gift set is a must have for any Superman fan. It is a great value as well for this set and it comes with a Blu Ray/DVD/Digital HD combo pack of the film. The artwork and packaging is pretty cool as well.
B000SX89TS|2.0|The more I listened to this music, the less impressed I became and the more I regretted my purchase. I read reviews before purchasing, but I was unfortunately misled by the overall solid rating that this album seems to have. In reality, I think that there are 300 Air/electronica fans out there who enjoy this cheesy elevator music, and then there's the rest of us. I imagine mostly 45 year old long haired nerds would enjoy listening to this. I actually heard a few interesting tracks  which led me to take a chance on this, and I realize that perhaps as electronica goes, this is said to be a classic example and I won't take that away from it, but unless you enjoy listening to something that sounds like it was created with some kind of synthesizer from the 80's, steer clear. This music sounds like something Johnny 5 or Max from Space Camp could have written and performed. I also feel that HAL from 2001: A Space Odyssey could have had a hand in this. So fire up the Atari or dust off your portable tape player and get ready for a journey into 35 years ago. Clearly, the buyers here were mostly replacing their 8 track / tape collections.
B00915G6YE|5.0|I loved ALL of the seasons of Dexter, unlike some who criticized the direction the show went in after the first few seasons. Throwing in Hannah as a love interest...someone who is as damaged and twisted as Dexter, was perfection. Michael C. Hall is an astonishing actor always completely &#34;becoming&#34; whatever role he takes on...he alone makes watching this and every season a joy.
B00632HWOG|4.0|this makes it easier to check my mail when I'm on the go or at work. i just wish I could add more than one account like I can on my phone.
B00CEZJT2E|4.0|Charges fairly fast, holds a good enough charge and it's the size of my Nexus 4.  It's even got an built in microusb plug so you dont need to carry an extra cable to charge your phone/tablet.  The only thing is the built in plug is &#34;big&#34; so I had to take off my my official bumper on the nexus 4 in order for the plug to fit.
B00F9040HU|2.0|This is an ok game. It is a teaser to purchase the full game. If you have already purchased another Atlantis game from Playrix, then you know this is like the others. This is not worth the full price if you own another Playrix game. The new levels end about ten to twenty after the free levels.
B00DG86ARK|5.0|This is definitely the highlight of their career. I have been a fan since the release of Weather Systems. Like others have said, having the choice of surround sound would have been nice, and they must have had legitimate reasons for not doing so. The stereo track is high quality, and my main rig is 2 channel, so not a real biggie for me.<br /><br />This makes up for all the terrible youtube videos of the band.....a must-get for anyone who likes Anathema. They are not phenomenal musicians, but have a way of putting together a powerful performance very well. Vocals by Vincent and Lee are heartfelt and spot on. The orchestral backup and locale is terrific, would love to see a concert in an ancient Roman venue! Lasse Hoile always brings out the best in a live show (check out Porcupine Tree's &#34;Anesthetize&#34; Blu-ray...now THERE is a masterpiece).
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I like this, especially for using netflix. Here in Brasil, there are few movies, but, for the low price, worth it!<br /><br />With Youtube is great too!<br />I recommend.<br /><br />PS.: The first setup was unable to iOS, Android used.
B000NVIXFK|4.0|The first RUSH album containing many acoustic verses and passages. Still hard up and heavy at times, not their best effort, but a solid effort that requires more listening. &#34;THE MONKEY BUSINESS&#34; was a non-vocal jam instrumental effort that was the highlight of my listen. Too bad &#34;MALIGNANT NARCISSISM&#34; wasn't long enough and the last track &#34;WE HOLD ON&#34; was probably their heaviest on this disc.<br /><br />I would like to hear GEDDY employ some organ and spacey moog synthesizer effects on some of their newer songs.
B0049CVUNG|5.0|This has to be the Best cast to date in the Fabulous Production.<br />Alfie Boe is the consumate performer and along with a stellar cast that compliment each other and the setting of the O2<br />arena, The Best Production of the show that I have ever experienced.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This game is awesome. It has the best graphics and tons of robots to chose from. This game is so beast
B0034G4P7G|5.0|This movie just proves what a scumbag<br />that Mark Zuckerberg really is.<br />The way that he treated his friends and the fact that he did basically steal the idea for facebook are told from<br />start to finish in this movie.<br />Jessie Eisenberg does an astounding job<br />as zuckerberg.

B008469DGY|2.0|Wasn't worth my time to figure it out so maybe it's a decent game but for the little time I spent trying to learn it it wasn't worth it.

B004GGM444|5.0|Although Skrillex did not invent dubstep, he has become the poster child for that genre of music.  This album is an excellent forebearer of the genre.  I can listen to this album from beginning to end without skipping any of the tracks.  I just wish there were more songs.
0385537131|1.0|***SPOILER ALERT****<br /><br />This book was good until Grisham completely screwed up the ending.  They went to trial because nobody wanted to settle, well after Lettie wins the trial and $24 Million dollars, we end up getting a settlement anyways, are u completely kidding me???  Why did we waste this whole trial and time and time again saying they would not settle.  Utterly ridiculous!!!!<br /><br />It was bad enough there was a judge admitting everything into the trial left and right that he shouldn't have been admitting.  Grisham leads us to believe that there is grounds for appeal, which would be highly unlikely as all questionable decisions removed Lettie still gets the $24 million.  So there was no point in the settlement to avoid the appeals.<br /><br />***End Spoiler***<br /><br />This is yet another disappointed book by John Grisham, do yourself a favor and stay away from this book and all other books by Grisham other than the Theodore Boone books as right now all he knows how to right are the books for the younger audience!!
B005PK56TA|5.0|Love it! Great show keeps you captivated its a great series edge of your seat each episode, always full of suprises
0811879542|5.0|My 2-year-old got this for his birthday and it is almost a daily read for us. He loves it! He loves especially when his big brother reads it to him, and reading aloud practice is always good for the 7-year-old, too, even if it's a simple read for him.
B000002HB4|5.0|Rockin' country sound - it doesn't get much better.  Great bass, clear lyrics and am easy to follow beat.  Buy two - one for the car and one for home so you are never without it - you'll have a back up when you wear out the first CD

B00BAXFAOW|2.0|Not my favorite Malcolm Gladwell book. Book starts with a great premise and the first chapter is great, but falls off quickly after that. I agree with most of the other negative reviews about it being boring, lengthy and not completely adding up.
B00C90T4QK|5.0|Love Michael Buble and this CD makes my reading weekend awesome...I plug my ear bugs in my Kindle and I set to have a great time listening and reading my favorite novel.
B005MMY9A8|4.0|Reasonable and keeps your attention.  Great animation and special effects.  This movie makes a great party movie especially with surround sound!
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|It was a good story but it lacked the content that makes the reader not want to put it down!
0385335482|4.0|Before I had even read the first page I posted a status update on Goodreads that there was a very good chance that I was going to toss the book across the room in frustration. See, quite a few years ago I read one of the books in this series….Shopaholic and Sister and honestly, I really did not like it. Or rather, I absolutely despised Becky Bloomwood and from then on, I had, on principle, avoided any other books in the series. Despite you know, actually enjoying almost all the standalone novels that Sophie Kinsella has written.<br /><br />Becky Bloomwood still annoyed me. I have never been a shopper and I certainly have never been in debt (thankyouverymuch) especially from shopping…so it was extremely difficult for me to relate to Becky but surprisingly I found Shopaholic to be an enjoyable distraction on a rainy evening. It was funny and actually kind of sweet at times and by the end I may have even developed just the faintest hint of affection for Becky.<br /><br />Probably will still avoid the rest of the series but at least I can no longer judge an entire series of books on one novel, that I very well may have disliked entirely because I hadn’t read the first book in the series. Or perhaps it honestly was a bad book
1455525839|5.0|I have been reading the Pendergast books for a little over 10 years now. A d I can say that the authors have had some ups and downs. I was not a massive fan of the Hellen trilogy, yet in reading this addition to the series, all I can say is: Pendergast is back!! This was a fantastic book with all the twists and turns that we expect from one of these books. It's also a return to a historical drama/mystery. The historical aspect of this book is strong, and really helps feed the modern parts of the book. I also feel as if Pendergast is less reclusive and back to his normal self. One of the best aspects of this book is the relationship between Corrie and Aloysius, and it's awesome to see the dynamics of it.
B004Q7CIFI|3.0|I tried to write a review for this novel soon after I finished reading it and realized that I still needed time to process what I had read but even a full month after finishing I’m still not sure what I thought about it.<br />Overall I liked it, like always Stephen King is an engaging storyteller and writer and I was tickled pink by the It references but I struggled to get sucked in as I usually do when reading a King novel. I even had to renew this from the library because I could not finish in the alloted time.<br />I’m thinking that I would have liked this book more if I had been older and had experienced the Kennedy assassination first hand or the subject matter was something that I had experienced (9/11 for example) …because like I said, it was a good book but not one I felt as though I could fully engage in
B00BEF1AEK|5.0|This is a pretty darn good game. Witty and colorful, I play a round or two put it down but then unlike some games I find myself going back to play a round or two again.
B0054R6BFM|4.0|It took me only a few hours to get through this book, once I started reading and figured out the format I felt like I was pulled into the story and although I really did want to put it down and go clear my head, I just couldn’t. I had to keep reading.<br />This was not an easy book to read. It was heavy, and sad, and sometimes unbearable but at the same time I found it terrifically executed, almost as if I was reading a mystery and trying to figure out whodunit and with that, it made me breeze through even though I do not typically read mysteries.<br />The one downfall of this book was the format. There is a lot of dialogue (both verbal and inner dialogue) in this book (probably 95% is pure dialogue) and it takes at least the first chapter to find the rhythm…Hannah’s dialogue is written entirely in italics which helps but I still found myself having to stop and read over a page to make sure I had read it correctly and knew who said what. It was’t an entirely unique way of writing a story, but not common enough that it made for an easy reading experience.
B00EVW04PE|2.0|Olympus Has Fallen rip off. Lots of action and entertaining but plot didn’t flow very well and lots of predictable moments. Jaime Foxx not so awesome.
B000SEHJGQ|3.0|Although I have dabbled a bit in some Bukowski verse, this was the first prose of his that I have read. I’m no stranger to the Beat writing style, having read On the Road and Junkie so I knew that Ham on Rye was probably going to be a very in your face, graphic novel…and I was right.<br /><br />I probably allowed my dislike for the vulgarity to influence my three star rating as it was actually a well written book, especially the earlier sections where our protagonist/Charles Bukowski’s alter ego was a child.
B00ESY77LO|3.0|Fun and visually appealing but hard to follow at times. I like these types of movies like Romeo and Juliet. Fun to watch but hard to understand whats happening at times.
006202406X|2.0|Upset that after getting so attached in the first two books that the end of the series was like this.  Allegiant falls short in character building, drawing you in the like the other two, and is downright disappointing.  There's so much backlash with this final book I don't think I wold really recommend reading the series in general.  I don't want to give anything away, but expect frustration and anger if you read Allegiant.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I played Castleville on Facebook,  I was very excited when I saw it on my kindle.  It's a great game.
B003V2HWP0|5.0|This is one of the most romantic movies I've ever seen.  The actors have great chemistry, even though it is doubtful that two brunettes with dark eyes would produce a very blond, blue eyed child, but I suspended belief in this case.  I love Stephen Dillane (a great actor), Sophie Marceau is beautiful, and it was a good story.
B00DW1WR14|2.0|PJ was one of my top two or three fav bands for many many years so I don't write this review easily or with any joy.  I can't find one interesting, edgy, NEW sounding song on this entire CD.  It sounds like left-overs from Avacado.  The band has grown stagnant and it pains me to no end.  Gone are the edgy days and they've been replaced with safe-sounding riffs, stale lyrical content and a collection of songs that all have a similar feel and meter.  Nothing grabbed me and made me say, \\"whoa, what was THAT?  I gotta hear that again!\\"  This CD sounds and feels totally generic.  The only reason I give it two stars is because I just can't bring myself to give a PJ CD one star.  But one star it deserves....
B003Y5H5EW|5.0|This movie I purchased to go with the set.  as for the movie I was a bit dissappointed in how it began and ended.  It seemed much was missing and chopped up.  The flow was lacking but I'd buy it again for the set.  Needs a final  movie to end things up good.
B00GH4RKYM|3.0|Terrific effects if you're into loads of CGI stuff and the Superman suit looks really great.  In fact, the whole look of the movie is good and the main reason I give it three stars.  The story, on the other hand.....yuck.  Good performances from all the name actors but they aren't given much to work with.  The dialogue is forced and serves only to pass some time between CGI action sequences.  And the climatic action sequence (while visually cool to watch) basically has an entire city destroyed as our hero and the bad guy throw each other all around destroying everything in their path.  Taken to its logical conclusion, hundreds of thousands of people would have died during this battle which made it much less fun for me to watch.  Yes, I know its a movie.<br /><br />Decent enough rental, I suppose, but watch it for the look and not for the substance.
B002QVZ71I|5.0|It was so good to watch this wonderful movie after a long time. Lot of good memories came back to my mind
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I think that this game is perfect for kindle fire hd.The only flaw is that you've shouldn't have to download new

B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|An interesting read that describes the political and cultural climate during Jesus' lifetime.  I don't think that the book is sufficiently rigorous in its documentation to pass muster with academic historians.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game it is so cooooooool!!!!!!! And also addicting finally in kindle fire tablet and you can play and see who is the best on Facebook friends that have candy crush but it is pretty hard to pass some levels
B003O86FMW|5.0|I'm reading it for the second time & it still has me hooked. I love love love this book! Definitely the best book of the three!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This book moved me so deeply that I actually wept through the last two chapters - a combination of grief and relief - and I was reading at work at lunch.  This story is so well crafted that although there are references to The Shining through out the book, it can stand alone, but it truly is a phenomenal sequel.  I am often disappointed by sequels of books I have loved since I feel like the sequels sometimes take away some of the mystery and impact of the first book (or movie).  Not so in this case!  The sequel here continues the story so naturally and only serves to enhance the impact of the first novel.<br /><br />I did reread The Shining before starting Dr Sleep so that I would have the novel in my mind as I read rather than the movie and TV adaptations.  I'm glad I did this since there were a few things I had forgotten over the years and a few things I may have missed the first time I read the book.  If its been a while since you've read The Shining or you've never read The Shining, do yourself a favor and read that first - I think it will enhance your reading experience.  I highly recommend this book.  Hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
B004T6IBNY|4.0|The kids really enjoying playing this.  They all have a competition going on who is going to score the most points on each table.

B00CT2P6VA|5.0|I have played all the Quell games and Quell Memento is by far the best!  I am not discounting the other Quell sagas as each in its own right was a joy and challenge.  Play them all . . . you'll love them!
B008GOG98Y|4.0|It brought back memories of my amateur bike racing days and my generation from the 1970’s and I was able to share it with my teen aged kids.  We enjoyed it as a family.  Wholesome story.
0307272702|4.0|I do like this book and I think it is a good pick for people who want a quick read. It will give people a general, broad understanding of what causes weight gain and loss. Unlike his first book Good Calories, Bad Calories, this book does not have nearly as much detail to provide context and the research that backs up his statements. So, if you want the &#34;cliff notes&#34; then this is the book for you. If you want an in-depth explanation (biological and research-based) then I would recommend his first book over this one.
B004W1GCNC|4.0|Always entertaining to watch fashionable British snobbery.  It is nicely intertwined with significant historical fascist moments in Europe and high class soap opera-ish drama.  I rate it a 4 out of 5 because it started slowly but once you get into it, it is a classic worth watching.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It's a love story and keep in mind Christian and Ana are in their 20's ;-) It has a good story line.
B001KWZ796|5.0|Love the attempt to show some history and the difference between stations of that time.  Have watched the movie time and time again.  Have it on DVD so purchased it for my Kindle Fire.
B00FHATBGW|5.0|A really good game. Keeps your interest all the way to the end. Can not wait for a part two.
B00GDFVTZQ|2.0|The game graphics are great, but to me gameplay is sort of lame. Wish I had saved my amazon coins for something else, more or less like the first installment. I think this is my last Rayman on android.
1250030951|4.0|I expected FANGIRL to be fun, exuberant, charming. A love letter to the Harry Potter series and the fan culture surrounding it. A book about how terrifying and miserable the first year of college can be, and how change comes for us all. All wrapped up with a satisfying HEA.<br /><br />And it was all of those things. In some ways, FANGIRL is a pure confection of a novel. A crisp, airy meringue of delight. Our protagonist, Cath, writes fanfiction about the `Simon Snow' series, a thinly veiled twist on Harry Potter. This fictional blockbuster series will have eight books and the eighth book is scheduled for release just as Cath's first year of college draws to a close.<br /><br />Cath spends all of FANGIRL writing an alternate book eight. Her version of how it all should end. And she has to finish before the real eighth book gets out and renders all of Cath's own work irrelevant. I loved the way that Cath wrestles with her fanfiction; how she defends its originality but  feels punctured when her writing professor criticizes her. How she loves the fan culture even though it renders her own work ephemeral.<br /><br />One thing that I loved about FANGIRL is that it brought back those years before the Harry Potter series was over and the wait seemed endless but there was always that wonderful anticipation of a new book. Of being inside the phenomenon, experiencing it as it unfolded. We (the fans) all knew something amazing was happening, but we didn't know where it would go or how it would end.<br /><br />I did wish, however, that FANGIRL had dealt more with what happens when the eighth Simon Snow book DOES come out. It's the end of an era-the series is over, Cath's fic is over. She's ready for something new. That's the moment where all of the experiences she's had in the novel tip her in a new direction. The very last page of FANGIRL is an excerpt from the first page of the first story Cath writes after her fanfic. It feels really momentous, like a sea change. But I wanted to know why she picked that story, and how she meant to continue. In a way, I felt like the most important part of the conclusion-the `now what?'-was left off the page.<br /><br />So this fanfic that Cath's writing is a sort of-I don't know, a symbol of the limbo she's in? A project that she started in high school. The crown jewel of her adolescence. By the time it ends, something else needs to begin. Adulthood, if all goes well. And that's the foreground. Cath's first year of college, which is both ordinary and excruciatingly painful (excruciatingly painful in very ordinary ways, I suppose). She's separating from her father, who's more dependent on his children than he ought to be. Her twin sister, Wren, is tired of being one half of a whole and pushes Cath away out of an understandable but immensely hurtful desire to do her own thing for a while. And that leaves Cath, always the less social/popular/cool one of the pair, struggling to make friends on her own for the first time in her life.<br /><br />She has a hard time of it. The first half of the book really tugged my heartstrings. Cath's isolation and hurt are sharply drawn. It gets to the point where even her last safe place, her writing, is poisoned. There were moments when I thought to myself, \\"If I read all of this painful stuff and there's no happy ending, I am going to be so mad.\\"<br /><br />But there is a happy ending. And a really sweet, lovely, so charming romance. And Cath gets to find out, at the end of the day, that she's fine just as she is. Time happens. Change happens. Some of it hurts. But she's good.d to know why she picked that story, and how she meant to continue.

B00FPH6M82|1.0|While it looked like a good movie from the trailers, the acting appeared forced. Also I hated Will Smith's voice in the movie, way too serious, calm/zen-like. The father-son, general-soldier interactions were really bad and overly emotional. At times I was asking myself what is the most ridiculous thing that could happen next... and it would then happen.

B005KP7EO0|2.0|I had a tough time getting into this one.  I usually really enjoy westerns and since I speak spanish I enjoy hearing it in movies like this.  Still, I had a tough time getting into it and the ending didn't really do it for me.  I'm sure some might enjoy this movie but it wasn't my thing.

B0014DQSG2|5.0|I love the movie n the actors in it.  I lost the first dvd n so i sent for another one so i am satisfied.
B00GH4RKYM|1.0|Too many screw-ups to ignore. We were trying to enjoy this movie and set our minds to stoopid, and influenced it with alcohol, but still - the common sense alarms went off at every turn. Too many WTF and comeOn! moments to ignore the sheer stupidity in how the creators were trying to sell us this pile of BS. I believe now, that the public and common moviegoers have become too intelligent and are smarter than the movie creators and directors. They must be dumb to put out a movie like this and think, they can (still) get away with this incoherence? They are catering and trying to sell to a dumber public, that got smarter and smarter on them, eventually became brighter than the producers, that obviously lost touch with their audience. This crap could have worked 10 years ago, but now? No way.! People are just getting more savvy and intelligent every day, partly due to exposure to complex electronics and the Internet. Movies will have to get smarter and offer more sophisticated plots, or they will just be shot down by the viewers.
B000W27AE0|3.0|I was a huge fan in the 80s, but now the album seems a bit hit and miss. Of course there is Shout and all that, but sometimes all the angst seems a bit contrived. Great singer and band though.
B005544TRQ|5.0|The characterization is really wonderful in this show. It takes something that in and of itself is not that interesting sounding, that is, lawyers going to court but creates a fantastic series.
B004SH40BQ|2.0|I used this with iPod 3rd generation and it would constantly drop connection.  I returned through Amazon with the same description with a flawless and quick return.
B008H6GH8I|3.0|I'm a huge fan of the resident evil series. I've watched nearly all of the movies, played several of the games across many different platforms (starting with RE 2), and read many of the novels.<br /><br />I was super excited to learn about this movie when it first came out. I loved the first CG animated flim and watched it at least 5 times. This movie had a high expectations to meet.<br /><br />Graphics/visuals- Simply astounding. Many of the scenes were so lifelike that you could easily forgot you were watching a computer animated film! The level of detail went as far as having each individual strand of hair doing its own thing. Talk about painstaking for the developers, I'm sure. I cannot fathom a way they could have improved on this aspect of the movie, unless they went 3d and somehow had the licker tongue actually come out and graze your cheek. That is to say, the visuals were superb.<br /><br />Story- Decent, not great. Leon Kennedy joins up with a revolution of people trying to overthrow the Government of a smaller country. Thing is, they are using umbrella created monsters to achieve this goal. As you can probably guess, Leon doesn't approve of this at all. Through a twist of fate, he ends up joining their ranks to take down an even worse foe. I'll try not to spoil anything. As I was watching this movie, I kept thinking it was over during the scene breaks. Never a good sign when a movie that lasts just over an hour and a half seems like it is 3 hours long. Maybe some of the non-fight sequences should have been shortened.<br /><br />Dialogue- Overall good, but there were a few lines that made me laugh because they were so cheesy. I can't remember the exact phrase, but near the end of the movie Leon tries to convince the leader of the rebellion that he has a reason to live. Even though this was meant to be a very dramatic, heartfelt moment the line he said made me chuckle, totally killing the climax of the scene. There were other cases like this, but that one sticks out most in my mind.<br /><br />Overall, it was very well animated but probably should have been further developed story-wise with more attention given to dialogue. Maybe I'll devote the time to watch it again, but the fact that I'm hesitant suggests it wasn't nearly as great as it should have been.
B003G4W49C|4.0|This is a cool book.  It's about a boy named Ender who's a genius kid and was taken to Battle School, a school in outer space teaching kids war skills.  Even though this book has words that start with an H or a D, I think it deserved a 4-star review.
006202406X|2.0|I can understand how the ending can be seen as a bit clever which is what I think she was going for. However, I knew that was going to be the ending from the very moment that Caleb said that he would be the one to &#34;do it.&#34; The ending left me feeling extremely depressed and lifeless which is not the type of ending I like at all especially after putting so much work into reading the whole series. I thought that she could have framed a masterful happy ending that was not cliche at all but she didn't. This felt a bit lazy to me. All of this being said, I thought that the story overall in the three books was great because in order to get that type of emotion out of someone (total depression) the story must be written in such a way that I felt extremely connected to the characters. I felt like I was there with four at the end.
B00E6Z0THE|5.0|Superb graphics, clever yet solvable puzzles, logically plausible, consistently entertaining. If you enjoy this genre, Alice Trapped in Wonderland is the game to get!
B00FLNRN06|3.0|Overall, this is a fairly funny movie. It has its good moments and some slow areas. It had way too many attempts at humor that were not humorous.<br /><br />Premise: Pot dealer creates a fake family to help him travel to Mexico and smuggle drugs back to the US. The movie details the antics they encounter.<br /><br />Acting: Top notch by all. Although all the actors do a great job, Will Poulter(Kenny, the \\"son\\"), is the show stealer. Jason Sudeikis(David, the father) gets most of the good one liners. Jennifer Anniston, Nick Offerman, Kathyrn Hahn and Emma Roberts also do a great job.<br /><br />Writing: This is where the movie sags. With such a great cast, they simply did not have enough material for the entire movie and attempted to use profanity and 'out of place' sexual content to compensate. This unnecessarily limited their audience base. If they had concentrated a bit more on the writing, this could have been an outstanding comedy that was more acceptable for a wider audience.<br /><br />Funniest scenes:<br />[...]<br />[...]<br /><br />Special effects: None<br /><br />Family friendly: Movie is about drugs and drug smuggling, graphic sexual discussions are common, profanity is the norm. Lots of \\"F\\" bombs. Stripping and brief frontal male nudity are also present. This is not a movie I would show with kids, teenagers nor guests but that is just me. This is not a complaint, but simply attempting to provide info for those who wish to know.<br /><br />Other: I found a new use for my BigBubba mug (you have to watch to find out).<br /><br />Even with the slow and awkward parts, the movie had enough good humor in it to get 3 stars. I would watch a sequel with the same cast.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|Everything you learn in this excellent tale is from the experience of the  people in it. No wasted exposition, just storytelling that engulfs you in the world they live in. My only regret is waiting so long to read it. Do not read anything more *about* this book - just *read* it!
B008V2THJE|4.0|Different atmosphere, different, but well known, actors, realistic type of problem tackled. Amazing view of  Paris add a real bonus to this movie.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I enjoyed much of the book as well as the previous two, but the ending was left flat and disappointing to me.
B0060ANOXY|4.0|I love Roger Waters, and wish for the day when they all get back together again as Pink Floyd. Although David Gilmore won the right in court to use the name Pink Floyd, Roger Waters was the Heart and soul of the band. I have seen him in concert doing &#34;The Dark Side of the Moon&#34; and &#34;The Wall.&#34;  You don't even hear the difference of the other two not being there. So, that said, I enjoy every solo album he puts out, including this one. Actually, this one was better than expected.
B008JF8O9M|5.0|Printbot is very easy to set up and use. As long as you know the IP address of the printer. I like it better than the cloud printers out there.
B000002GYN|4.0|I don't think this is the best work they ever did, but it's not bad. My favorite will always be &#34;The Hell Freezes Over&#34; album.
1932100660|4.0|I was a little disappointed in the book in that it seemed repetitious in it's content. Once you have read the first 20 to 30 percent of the book, you have read it all. It was informative and can very well cause one to change their way of eating.
B00FLDG5AA|5.0|Even though Eric himself doesn't contribute much on this album, he has gathered many artists that make up for it. It is truly a remarkable album (CD).
B00ELD19OI|4.0|there's a certain type of melody that I like to hear which usually borrows elements from the Dorian, Lydian and Phrygian modes. this tonality is certainly dominant within the recurring themes heard in this release, to my ear anyway... if you like progressive music Haken definitely fit the genre well and their video for 'Cockroach King' is hilarious. I would like to catch one of their live performances, definitely.
B001V7YWTQ|5.0|What can I possibly say? It's Eric Clapton and Steve Winwood! Who could possibly find fault with this album? I already had the single CD version, but had to have the two CD set also. Two of the greatest musicians of my time (The seventy's).
B00GIY5OGC|5.0|So exciting like it is!<br />Ver y hood forma My child<br />100% recomendable<br />Excellent picture<br />Movie and musica liked<br />Hood
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Once again, I cannot find any fault with any work he puts out. He is a true professional, and you can hear that on his CD's. This one was no exception. He can do no wrong in my book.
B00GH4R95C|5.0|This is a story that's been told so many times, your first thought is, &#34;Oh no...not again!&#34; But the in-depth look at an alternate world, combined with the unique &#34;physics&#34; of the fight scenes make this a mesmerizing and very personal kind of film.  I highly recommend it.
B0096Y94PI|4.0|The title track is excellent, but some of the tracks are less than I expected from Michael Jackson. His other albums are much more enjoyable.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|This series just seems to get better.  I am looking forward to season 3 and then season 4 after the first of the year.
B00EPFEY44|5.0|I don't think he has ever put out an album (CD) that was not perfect in every way. He is one of the tops in his &#34;category.&#34;
B0093QE37S|5.0|This has always been one of my favorites.  Grant, Hepburn & Stewart are the greatest.  I know the plot by heart but never miss a chance to watch it again.
B00CW6DAKC|2.0|It was a good game, reminds me of country life on Facebook, until I went to open the game today and it is telling me I need to update until I click on update and it takes me to the apps page where it says open game.  I click on open and it tells me I need to update.  With this new issue I can only give it two stars, without this issue I would gladly give it four.  Unfortunately this is becoming too common an issue with apps updating and I have no patience for it, nor any hope it will get fixed.
B009CQMZ6K|3.0|good item for the price but it keeps falling off and it doesn't stick  very  well. Needs better suction and it would be great
B002QVZ71I|5.0|Tom Hanks and Sally Fields do an amazing job acting in the film. I enjoy the story line and mama's wisdom that Forrest is always quoting. It is a classic movie!
B007P7UF06|1.0|It is a great movie, one of our favorites, but the sound track was so out of synch with the picture is was impossible to enjoy. Sort of like a badly dubbed foreign film.
B007TK77QE|1.0|did not enjoy. waited whole book for something to happen. i seem to have missed the point of the story. depressing
B00FXES5WS|5.0|I love listening to Susan Boyle and I really love Christmas music. Susan Boyle has recorded my Christmas favourites. I will have many enjoyable hours of listening to her beautiful voice singing the most important Christmas music.
B0031RS4UM|3.0|after the first book, i found this one not as captivating. slow to get into. ending ok. good but not great
B0013DDN5M|5.0|I had this CD on cassette many years ago and used to play it constantly! As with a lot of my classic music selection, I realized I hadn't converted this classic into a more modern format. With tracks like the title track, Bloodstone, and You've Got Another Thing Coming, what's not to love about this goodie?
B000HKW7E0|5.0|This movie is a classic, we watch it at Christmas time and all year long...just hysterical!!!  My kids and I love it!!
091581112X|5.0|Exactly what I need in this very chaotic world to help myself. I read this book when i was 27years old.  Part of the content resonated and most parts were a blur.  Now with a lot more life experiences (ups and downs) at 39 years old.  This book simply resonates.  I revisited this book to help a friend find her directions and take this opportunity to write a review. The other books in the series have been very helpful too.  Sanaya Roman's website has free short meditation mp3 that has been a life saver for me when I am lost in direction or when my mood is in my shoes. Hope you can benefit from them too.
B00CNBS5XS|5.0|My nephew love this set.  Some of the Star Wars Lego sets look very cool but don't have a lot of playability to them.  This kit is surprisingly complex with very cool moving doors, secret compartments and a built in handle for making play easy.  It is also fairly large.
B002VL7CRA|4.0|I enjoyed this book minus a few parts when the author eluded to one of the main characters in a not so good way. The story itself is a touching one.
B00F56AZK4|5.0|Can choose 9 pieces for my 2yo or 148 pieces for my wife. Great puzzle app. Glad I bought the full version!!

B000FC2L1Y|5.0|I keep trying to decide which book in this series is my favorite. This is definitely in the top seven! HA! The characters continue to come to life and I can't get enough of Jamie and Claire.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|It's a really great but can move slow in getting the items we need. It's a really fun game though!!!
140053271X|5.0|Readability in Sunlight is super even when the sun is directly hitting the screen; can't be beat! The blacks are great and the contrasting white whites really helps these old eyes of mine! I like the Android operation too.
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|Fun, fun, fun and great, exciting ending!  Can't wait for the next one!  I hope Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child have already started their next saga
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Chromecast only worked on Netflix or youtube, both of which are already preloaded on my TV.  If you try to view a video clip from chrome or a old episode from hulu, it only sends video, not sound.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I always expect that constant King greatness as I begin one of his books and I have NEVER been disappointed! This was another in a long line of exceptional journeys with a true master!! Love, love, love it!!
B005T87QCI|1.0|Can't believe EVERYTHING cost actual money. Until fake money won't play the game. Would be five stars if was cheap and I could play. Don't get unless you have a lot of extra money.
B00CNGA1PS|5.0|I am addicted to podcasts especially the obscure motorcycle/automotive culture types.  The Podcast Addict App allows me to quickly search the podcasts I want and allows me to download only the shows I want to my android phone.  The controls are straight forward and can be quickly picked up, even by a novice like me.  I have tried the fruit products for my podcasts but by far the easiest to search and download was the Podcast Addict.  I have not had any problems with the App on my android device.
B00AA8Q0FQ|5.0|...but the kids absolutely LOVE it. They watch it over and over and over again. They never tire of it.

B003ODIZL6|5.0|Hahahahahah I didn't even read the dictionary I don't even know why I'm doing this I'm sorry for wasting your time but I must go now sorry :(.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|I enjoyed the books base. It's characters and it's deliverance. You'll enjoy the book also if you read it. God bless
B004DLPXAO|1.0|i did not know how to use it. It was confusing and did not work on my phone. maybe it would work better on phones that arent a samsung galaxy s3
B0089LOG02|4.0|I cannot put my finger on it, but I really liked this book! The way the two lives are intertwined, the young modern day orphan and the elderly woman whose memories she helps uncover in the attic was well done. It was sad at times but also brought two unlikely people together from very different generations and they bond. Molly uncover things for Vivian and learns things about herself. I know all this sounds &#34;cheesy&#34;, but this is a part of American history that I knew nothing about and learned much from.
B00CL151G4|5.0|This is my favorite television series - never miss it!  Most entertaining show to come along for a long time.
B00D3NSDVO|5.0|Almost three stories, each enthralling. I enjoyed this book so much that, for the first time ever, I rationed my reading in order to prolong the pleasure. I wish he will write more.
B00GOQ9M4O|5.0|I think those who are not as deeply connected to what the show is trying to accomplish may find this episode a bit lackluster. I found it to be very good. Exploring the depths of the Governor and building on his character was a necessary step to fulfilling the comic story line in the show. For him to just show up still void of his human side would have been a mistake. His ability to connect to others and regain his humanity should be an interesting twist to how he responds to those in the prison, revenge motive or not. My guess is that all of the 1 and 2 star raters are just in it to watch zombie heads explode. Dig a little deeper, people.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I am obsessed with this trilogy... Veronica Roth is a fantastic writer and I would love to read more books written by her.<br /><br />Very shocking ending-- It was great! Will definitely reread this trilogy before Divergent comes out in March 2014!!
B0063IH60K|1.0|the game has full screen ads that pop up way too often which makes it unacceptable. also seemed to make my kindle run slow until I uninstalled it.
B008YKGQR4|5.0|Easy to use, let's me stay in touch on my Kindle. Recommend it to anyone who wants the added portability.
B00FLDG5AA|4.0|I love the rock, blues, and country performances on this album. It includes most of the guitar and vocal greats who appeared in fine form at Crossroads 2013 in New York City's Madison Square Garden. These festivals have been held every three years since 2004 to benefit Eric Clapton's Crossroads Centre, a drug treatment facility in Antigua. At 29 tracks, however, the two-CD set only presents highlights from the 2013 festival. A much fuller version is available on DVD or Blu-ray with a total of 45 performances spread over nearly five hours. What's missing from the CDs? Some classic songs:<br /><br />1. Time Is Tight - Booker T. with Steve Cropper<br />2. Born Under A Bad Sign - Booker T. with Steve Cropper, Keb Mo , Blake Mills, Matt Guitar Murphy & Albert Lee<br />3. Everyday I Have The Blues - The Robert Cray Band with B.B. King, Eric Clapton & Jimmie Vaughan<br />4. Spider Jiving - Eric Clapton with Andy Fairweather Low<br />5. Next Of Kindred Spirit - Sonny Landreth<br />6. Cry - Doyle Bramhall II with Alice Smith<br />7. Big Road Blues - Kurt Rosenwinkel with Eric Clapton<br />8. Whipping Post - The Allman Brothers Band<br />9. I Got To Let You Know - Los Lobos with Robert Cray<br />10. Tumbling Dice - Vince Gill with Keith Urban & Albert Lee<br />11. Walkin' Blues - Taj Mahal with Keb Mo<br />12. Please Come Home - Gary Clark Jr.<br />13. Going Down - Jeff Beck with Beth Hart<br />14. I Shall Be Released - Eric Clapton with Robbie Robertson<br />15. Crossroads - Eric Clapton<br />16. High Time We Went - Finale with Ensemble<br /><br />It wouldn't have been hard to fit most of these 16 tracks on a third disc, especially \\"Time Is Tight,\\" \\"Born Under A Bad Sign,\\" \\"Everyday I Have The Blues,\\" \\"Whipping Post,\\" \\"Tumbling Dice,\\" \\"I Shall Be Released,\\" \\"Crossroads,\\" and the finale. But since Rhino, for whatever reason, hasn't seen fit to do so, and since the video discs are only $2-$5 more, I would suggest springing for one of those sets. Seeing icons like B.B. King, Jeff Beck, Robbie Robertson, and Keith Richards play with Eric Clapton is worth every penny. The DVDs and Blu-rays provide optimal audio quality and feature conversations with the artists as well as behind-the-scenes footage.<br /><br />Still, the tracks on these two CDs include seven Clapton numbers and several inspired pairings, particularly with Vince Gill on \\"Lay Down Sally\\" and the Allman Brothers on \\"Why Does Love Got to Be So Sad?\\" And there are many standout treats. My personal favorites are Booker T's \\"Green Onions,\\" Robert Cray's \\"Great Big Old House,\\" John Mayer's and Keith Urban's \\"Don't Let Me Down,\\" Buddy Guy's \\"Damn Right, I've Got the Blues,\\" Los Lobos' \\"Don't Worry Baby,\\" Taj Mahal's and Keb Mo's \\"Diving Duck Blues,\\" and the Allman's \\"Midnight Rider.\\" But everyone is sure to find something they enjoy.ff Beck, Robbie Robertson, and Keith Richards play with Eric Clapton is worth every penny.

B0094BB4TW|2.0|Very limited, doesn't update well. I later downloaded, &#34;full Facebook&#34; and am very satisfied with that app., don't waste your time with this one.
B002VECM6S|5.0|It's the best thing Sandra Bullock has done.This is a story that will make a strong man cry. If he doesn't, his wife should dump him. It's the best thing Sandra Bullock has done.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love the sound of rain and thunder. This app allows me to fall asleep to that every night and even switch things up when I feel the need for variety. I recommend this app for everyone not just those who find it hard to fall asleep and stay asleep.
B00AEFYW64|5.0|One of my favorite Sean Connery movies. A great story, well acted from a film era of notoriously bad acting.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I found the history of the orphan trains fascinating. I had heard about them but never knew if it was true. The characters were well developed and the story was well written. I thoroughly enjoyed the book.
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|I really like Pendergrast. And I like the interplay he has with this young woman he has chosen to champion. That  this also goes far back in history weaving toward today kept my mind jumping to see what would happen next. And the references to the other authors had me reviewing the stories mentioned in this book. WOW. How fine is it to have one book lead you back to review other stories by different authors.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|You pepele out there that still have the crudy youtube well this one is better clear HD no glitches and you don't have to wait on your youtube video it is much better than the youtube downloader trust me it is a great app.
B00D7Z4GQY|2.0|I normally like character driven books but this novel was disappointing at best. The big secret revealed is not a surprise. Irrelevant details are described for pages on end. The best part of this novel was the epilogue. Save your time and money.
0385340990|5.0|Loved this story, the characters are well drawn and the tension of the times<br />comes thru with the capacity of the human will to survive is well shown.
B008D28HYS|5.0|I just beat the game and I loved it. I wish there were more levels. This game gave me months of puzzles though and was worth the price.
B0042C1BP0|5.0|this movie doesn't stop being awesome, full of adventure and a great reset of the Bond character. I loved it.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|This will be one the best super hereo movies of all time ! Nice story plot exploring from the original ones from the 80&#34;s staring the late Christopher Reeves. What a tribute in my eyes !
B006DJ2JSI|4.0|It was just what I needed, so that makes it a great purchase for my kindle fire, I like it.
B00004RJ71|4.0|This truly a classic ganster movie above the rest compared to other latino movies i have purchased. An a original Thanks Amazon !!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This game is awesome.  Do your self a favor and download this baby asap.  Mucho Grande entertaining!  I'd buy that for a dollar.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I play this game on Facebook and this is so much better than expected. Looking forward to new games. Let's go have some fun.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|I really enjoyed the continuing saga of Jack,jr and the rest of the team which was really evident as this will probably be the last of the series with the demise of Mr. Clancey. I hope not but at least the way we know the books as anyway.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|outstanding that is all I can say but j am a John Gresham fan and have read most of his books
B00FXMGI0G|4.0|Wonderful movie with good amount of action and comedy, Bruce Willis and Helen Mirren were absolutely wonderful as were the rest of the cast. I definitely recommend this to all.
B00CH3DBNQ|3.0|This was just an okay read.  You can tell the thought process is that of a young person because the ideas bounce back and forth during her narration.  What she stands for and what she went through makes an incredible story and after reading it, I know how blessed I am to live in the United States of America.  No one should have to endure what she endures and yet she would love to return to her homeland in spite of it all.  She is a brave, courageous young lady and should be commended for what she's accomplished.  She read and studied physics at the age of 12 and loved every minute of it.  Our 12-year olds are reading The Hunger Games.  There really is no comparison in the lives of Pakistanis and Americans.  Thank God for America.  As far as the book goes, it was interesting but slow.
B00GH4RKYM|3.0|It was ok. They overhyped the oh so important message of what will the common every day people think of super man. They took a fun super hero movie and made numerous Jesus Christ references that it got old. Loved Krypton though and super's real parents. In fact all the actors did a good job. It just seemed preachy to me.
B00C74SHRK|5.0|One of these rare books that you really live in while you read it. Exciting from the first page on. I loved it! I started reading it again right after, because all other books on my kindle suddenly seemed dull in comparison.
B00GH4R95C|4.0|I really liked it. If they wouldn't have changed the main storyline from the original, I would have given it a 5. Henry Cavill is by far my favorite Superman!
B00CL0J99K|5.0|This was an awesome movie. I loved the first two Iron Man movies, and this one was just as good if not better than the first two.
B00CNQ7CRI|1.0|I adored the first two Bridget Jones books and was delighted to find out another was in the making. I'm sorry to report that I couldn't finish it. It was a huge disappointment and almost painful to read. The original Bridget Jones was delightfully quirky. This Bridget is desperately cliche.
B000JIHP88|5.0|This is an awesome mobile. My baby loves it. The first one we purchased broke. But, Amazon's customer service responded very quickly and replaced it right away. The new one has been going strong for the past 8 months. Great buy! It lights up and plays different songs classical tunes or jungle noises. It even has a remote, so you can turn it off from a far and not wake the little one. And, this mobile was a replacement for a disappointing one we had bought previously.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Eh.  Wasn't really drawn in this time.  The characters' deviations from past two novels established traits was disconcerting.  Still, a solid conclusion to the story arc.
B00BUAEYVK|3.0|Not as good as I was expecting. To be honest I was a little bored. And, I had really been looking forward to seeing this one as I love all the other DIe Hard movies.
B000GOSVEW|1.0|Stupid dialog that likes to think it's more clever and making a bigger point than it is.  Stupid circumstances like holding a gun to a guy's head while he's getting a blowjob and expecting him to be able to focus on his work.  Stupid plot twists.  John Travolta's stupid haircut.
B0031ES8P6|5.0|Very cute little toy. Matches my daughters room perfectly. The eyes and nose are small plastic pieces, so do keep it away from small children.
B00G32QIEG|3.0|It is not something I would simply recommend, but I didn't not regret the time I spent watching it. meh...
0307236722|5.0|More than recipes, it's a primer for baking, every thing is explained ,why and how ro.<br />Just the best baking books with fantastic recipes.
B008OLO7ME|5.0|This is a very nice bag. I always get complements on it. It has a nice number of pockets and holds both my ipad (without case) and my ultra thin laptop and all my cords, mouse, etc.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Season 4 is off to a stellar start!  The Walking Dead is infamous for being a show where nothing happens for 37 of the 43 minutes of programming, but this season everything has been pretty consistent thus far, with twists, turns, and issues at every point.  This season has brought walkers back as being the main threat, unlike last season which hardly focused on walkers, and instead focused on those living enemies.  If season 4 keeps up like this, I'll be a very satisfied fan!
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I was pretty freaking shocked to say the very least about this book. Overall it wasn't bad, but I'm still recovering.
B005K17RU0|4.0|This is a wonderful app! I use it all the time; especially in winter &amp; it's free - can't beat that.
B00B0LPYXG|2.0|I knew going in that this movie was about an addict and his addiction.  The pilot aspect of the film was simply ridiculous.  I think it's written for people who think they can be great at something without any effort or while high.  Not a message they should be catering to.  Once you get past the idiotic set up, it's a mediocre movie about addiction.
1594744475|5.0|These recipes are more than food, there art! Very informative. Book was just like brand new. Pictures to go along with instructions. Playing with food is fun!
6304490119|5.0|This was the first Stargate ever made. This one was the one that gave us the desire to watch all the Stargate series that came after this one. It is filled with intrigue, action, drama, joy, laughter. We recommend this to anyone especially if you love space movies with action.
1568363931|5.0|I really like this cook book, it helps with portion control. The recipes are great too! I would recommend for anyone trying to watch there wait.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love this app. It lets me know everything I need to know about the weather. And it gives me weather alerts that are so easy to check. I highly recommend this app..:)
B002KKCVUA|5.0|1st pair lasted through 8 years of camping, casual walking and kayaking.  This pair is 2 weeks old.  So far so good.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This comes in so handy app especially when the power goes out. This is a great backup! You choose the time you want up and it will stay on the same time for as many days as you set it for. You only have to set it one time. Highly recommend this app!...:)
B00992CF6W|5.0|Got this for my grandchildren.. I do NOT understand it at all...but all three of them love it...as one plays with it...they change things and their cousin has to figure out and add to or change...it is a great game for them to share and they actually understand it all. I don't but it keeps them happy and in a fun exchange. Their mother's tell me it is okay for all ages.
B00FN811SY|5.0|what a great way to read the Bible  on the kindle it is lit up and I love having the other translations to compare right next to what I am reading  Thank you so much
B003EV6DBM|5.0|The new Doctor fits in perfectly! Just wish I would have known he would last so long. Highly recommend it!

B001DJ7PQ4|5.0|Gotta love the Doctor! Really hated to see the end of this version, but change is unavoidable. Highly recommend this!
B00005JKHN|5.0|Absolutely awesome it was like it was brand new perfect condition very satisfied with my disney sleeping beauty purchase :)
B0000844I8|5.0|The beginning of a great adventure and a beautiful, if rocky, friendship! We are not alone in the galaxy and the series may soon be proven true! Nibiru and her people are on approach. Highly recommend!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was amazing.<br />It was thrilling, with unexpected events.<br />The new characters are a great addition to the series.<br />Can't wait to read the rest of the series.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|I love The Good Wife.  I feel there is always a great story with twists and turns. Good creativity with investigative work.
B00EK0UBPU|5.0|The characters were so real to me and the story took me on a nicely paced trip that moved my heart.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Great follow up setting from &#34;A Time  To Kill&#34;. Loved to revisit the old characters. I would hope we would get to hear from them again sometime in the future.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Amazing writing. Best book I have read in a long time. The imagery is incredible.  The subject matter handled expertly.
1476747016|5.0|I giggled throughout this whole book. It was so adorably cute, and had more than what is on her blog/facebook. I keep it always visible so I have a constant happy reminder when I am in my room. If you like supporting an author and their art-Claire would be a good pick.
B00GH4R95C|5.0|Of all the different versions of Superman that I've seen this one is the best. It really shows superman in a different more human light plus I like how they still have him interacting with his Mom and she knows his real identity and purpose yet still she treats him like her baby boy. The cast was superb especially Michael Shannon he really stole the show as General Zod even though Henry Cavill was the lead as Clark/Superman and he was very good, Michael Shannon outshined him in this role.<br /><br />Overall excellent movie.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I read the book loved it. Watched it at the Cinema loved it. Bought it on Amazon so I could watch it more often.<br />I highly recommend the book and the movie!
B00BS4PF0C|5.0|Love Blake Shelton, and love his music. Down loaded the CD right after the CMA show. A Good Buy for his music.
B009AMAGQM|5.0|I read the book Beautiful Creatures and finally got the DVD from Amazon. It was true to the book and Jeremy Irons was fabulous!<br />I recommend the book and the Movie! I enjoyed both!
B00BD99JMW|3.0|This final book in the series was not near as compelling as the first two books. There could have been a lot more detail about the world outside the city,but was just glossed over. Also using 2 points of view, Tris and Tobias  was confusing and it seemed that the author did that to help with the final ending. Also depressing and boring at the conclusion.
B001D09OAI|4.0|When the crowd sings &#34;Wild Thing&#34; as Charlie Sheen's character comes in from the bullpen, the hair on my neck stands up.  This is a great baseball comic and dramatic movie.
0810994739|5.0|The best way to keep my granddaughter's occupied.  They spend hours reading these books.  They are an awesome product and are<br />perfect for young readers.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This was a fun game that took me about two hours to sol e all ten rooms. Hard enough to be a challenge but not to the point of frustration.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this series. It was not your predictable ending, but I thought it was well written. I recommend reading this series.
B001EC2ISA|5.0|It's just a classic movie that I love to watch now and again.  I especially love when Beetlejuice's head gets shrunk.
B004GYY714|4.0|it is easy to use; allows you to listen even international radio stations. the audio quality is really high. TuneIn version for Samsung TV does not recognize some international radio station formats
B0038M2AZA|5.0|This is an amazing story.. Stories like this should assure all that God never makes a mistake. Temple Grandin has and is teaching all that being who you are is all that you need to do. I love this story
B003O86FMW|4.0|I read the first hunger games and loved it...<br /><br />They immediately picked up the second book to read and then ended up putting it down for months before picking it up to finish. Once finishing the book I did like it the cliff hanger ending has left me wanting to start the third book, but it took me forever to get into the book because the first two parts were really slow pace. Part three sped up and got more interesting for me.<br /><br />I can not wait to see how this book converts to screen it was a great book it's a great series, but I could tell this was a connector book.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It was great and I can't wait to see the movie and read all of the books again they were great
0786891416|3.0|It was delivered quickly.  I just am a little disappointed.  I thought it was a brand new book.  It has some wear on the edge of the binding.
B00CA6WLAE|5.0|YOU MUST READ THIS BOOK. IT IS AMAZING.but read the first  book before for it to make more sense than just reading this book.
1401311083|3.0|It was delivered quickly.  I just am a little disappointed.  I thought it was a brand new book.  It has some wear on the edge of the binding.
067101756X|4.0|Item and condition as described by seller.  Very interesting book.  Fans of this type of material should also check out the book: UFOs: Myths, Conspiracies, and Realities by Col. John Alexander who disputes some of the info contained in this book.
B00881VLCE|4.0|A great way to spend some time. The puzzles can be challenging and the pictures are beautiful.  The app will sometimes abend while I'm working on a puzzle. So that's a problem but the puzzles are great.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|My tablet may not necessarily be 'mainstream'.  I found the only thing I could do is uninstall Candy Crush Saga because it kept crashing & haven't had the chance to reinstall yet :(
B0054PSY2W|5.0|Love this movie..Alot of good actors in this movie.. Comical. Good movie and a great price. Love that it is on blu-ray
B006LSZECO|1.0|The plot and writing style are interesting but the characters are so awful.  I couldn't root for any of the characters... and they just got worse as the book went on.
098478280X|4.0|Grabbed this book to get some ideas for different exercises to run through with engineer candidates at my company. It contains many exercises, and also is a good companion for refreshing your skills. Well written.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is a lot of fun.  Both my daughter and I love to play it and it's hard to put it down.
B004NOCCEG|4.0|Clearly biased, slightly uneven, but well worth watching. Whatever your leanings, this documentary cannot be faulted in its excellent, straightforward representation and visualization of the financial devices that went into creating the greatest economic downturn since the Great Depression. Very clear and informative, if laying blame unevenly.
B00688628M|5.0|A great portrayal of what these men went through.  Realistic with emphasis placed on both the horrors of war and the human response.
006202406X|5.0|Great book! Even thought it has a sad ending, I still LOVE IT!!! I recommend it to you guys!! ❤️
B00F56AZK4|1.0|Does not work. Have never been able to open this app. It just goes nowhere. I'm disappointed. I was really looking forward to have a little Jigsaw puzzle to play with.
B005XUC398|4.0|A great inside look at the financial world. It was informative and more than a little scary to learn how little control the players really have over the economy.
B00GFOIUVQ|1.0|The first part of the game was fun but by level 3 u start getting upgrade stuff but with real money and u dont get many coins when u win but everything cost a ton now i would give 5  stars but they need to change the cost of everything
B0093QHWLC|5.0|Terrific movie. Great story about life and great actors. For some reason, I had never seen this movie before and I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Excellent,, such a difficult, controversial subject handled in a wonderfully human manner. I loved every page oft. I recommend it wholeheartedly and hope her other books are as good as this one.
B005LAII0I|5.0|First of all, Julia Roberts is an extraordinary actress. She did not disappoint in the movie. I really enjoyed the costumes. The storyline has more to it than the classic Snow White story. There is action. I loved the karate. The actors were selected superbly. I really do like the way the story of Snow White was made in stark contrast to the book where it counted. I think I loved the romance most of all. I appreciate the fact that Julia Roberts made a movie that she might not mind her children watching. Way to go Julia Roberts!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|bought mine on November 23, 2012  - no issues what so ever (sometimes it just too big to carry on simple birthday parties that we plan to only use on lens, in these cases we bought an extra small carrying case that is just big enough for the camera
0316055433|5.0|There is little to add to any of the 5-star reviews here, except, perhaps, to advise one to go to Stephen King's NYT book review for the most instructional summary.  I disagreed with only one of Mr. King's views--I couldn't read enough about furniture restoration. Tartt's descriptions of grain and texture are so important to understanding how a major part of this book happens.  As for potential readers put off by the length of the book, why bother?  There are plenty of mass market romance or crime novels out there for your reading pleasure.  This book is a work of art in itself. If one doesn't love words or beautiful writing, there is no need to bother with Donna Tartt or her other two magnificent books.
B00005RDSM|5.0|A Disney Classic to be enjoyed by all. A must for children. The magic of a good story to be shared over and over. A timeless tale
B00009L1UP|4.0|I think it's a good CD, if you like Queensryche you will enjoy it, good product quality and I received my merchandise quick.
B003H9M1Q2|5.0|A true Disney Classic to be shared for generations. A family movie to hand down. A heartwarming story for one and all
B000OJFV4C|5.0|If you enjoy period themed movies or series, this is the one for you!  Costumes, sets are great and acting is superb.  If you couldn't see this on TV, here's your chance to see it now.
B000683VI4|5.0|Love this story. Watch it over and over and over. Have shared with family and friends and all agree a great movie nite for one and all
B00514HDNW|2.0|Okay, so I did see the movie first and already had an impression of what the book was going to be about.  Unfortunately, the movie and the book only have the main charactor and the theme of the book in common.  I got 65% through the book still waiting for the big event of Neville finding some sort of possible cure and something more interesting than just his depressing musings.  To say the least the book does not give the movie justice....the movie is by far the better of the two.  I loved the movie and own the DVD.  Now if the book was as suspenseful as the movie, I probably would have finished the book.  I just got  BORED!  I would not recommend this book to anyone, especially if you have seen the movie.  You will just be disappointed.  I will admit that the beginning of the book kept me waiting for what would happen next, but then it just got boring....get to the point already!  In the movie, they know what caused the 'Outbreak' of the vampire virus; Neville's wife and daughter was significant characters .  In the book it really doesn't even tell you anything about the mother, the daughter, and it portrays  that the dog (of which was a main character ) was just a stray dog and not the great, smart dog of the movie.  If it wasn't for the fact that I had seen the movie and thought it would be a great addition to it and also to my book collection, I NEVER would have purchased it.  It was very disappointing.  To say the least I DO NOT recommend this book.
B004DK5CYM|5.0|Love this heartwarming story. A real tear jerker. A family movie night must . The true story brought to life
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Have never played this game before and thought I would download it to see what it was about...and I am pleasantly surprised.  Very fun and works excellent on my Kindle Fire HD. Thanks Zynga!
034580404X|5.0|A trilogy that keeps you wanting more. Read all three within days and passed on to girlfriends to enjoy and pass on.
B001NHNG64|3.0|Some technical goof-ups.  Why do I have to put in seventeen more word just to submit this short, simple review?
B003G4W49C|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this with my son and the conversations that followed.  Good twists and ethical dilemmas made this more than just entertainment.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|The first Follett Book I read was Pillars of the Earth.  Like that book, Fall of Giants shows Follett's ability to weave together many complex characters over a lifetime (or more) worth of time.  I really enjoyed this book.  While it is long (as was Pillars of the Earth), it never gets boring.  When I was away from it I wondered what would happen next.  That is the sign of a good novel.
B009POCG5Y|5.0|This was a great movie.  It isn't just a sports movie, and it's not just a love story either.  It's got the best of both worlds.  Clint was great in this movie, and it's a good story line, too.
B000W93CHC|5.0|I liked this book almost as much as Pillars of the Earth.  Follett is master at weaving together many characters into one marvelous and enthralling story that takes place over a lifetime (or more).  Start with Pillars and then read this next.  They are both very long, but very entertaining reads.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|It was good because it was different. I think i would like a little more action and suspense.<br />The writer can spice it up in the next one.
B00B5HQLMI|3.0|Disappointing!  Although a great action movie, i will leave at that an action movie.  Everything we love about JAmes Bond movies is missing form this and the previous 2 Bond Movies, No decent Bond Girls, no cool Gadgets, etc..previously seen special affects.<br />Again great action movie poor Bond Movie we have gotten to expect a lot more form Bond movies over the years and this fails
B00DJWV11I|5.0|Tangled was a very fun read. Fun to have a story told by the guys point of view, there aren't enough romance novels told by the guys point of view. Obviously make for plenty of comedy, and plenty of the hot steamy stuff.
B00CRMWMZ0|3.0|Kind of a letdown - did not quite live up to the hype for me. &#34;Giorgio Moroder&#34; is a highlight, though.
B00FXMGI0G|4.0|Same great crew as before plus Anthony Hopkins.  While this one had lots of action as well, it did not seem to move as fast as the first movie.  All in all, an enjoyable movie.
B00D6MJOAQ|5.0|A bit darker than previous BOC releases, but puts me in a good place when I listen to it. Sonically interesting and adventurous, goes places previous BOC releases did not. Highly recommended for BOC fans.
B0094KTCMO|5.0|Great movie. My son can't stop watching it. Would like to see a Part 2. Love it, love it, love it.
B008KE3960|4.0|There is a very simple game.  The strategic challenge isnt so simple.  Be on your toes at all times! Love it!
B00FRQ32N4|4.0|My son loved the movie and can't stop watching it that he ask me to download the game and he can't stop playing it and naming all the robots.
B00DQZQSNO|5.0|I like the color, the clasps, the rubber bank hook, and the back openings for the &#34;on/off&#34; and &#34;volume&#34;.  It fits well and looks great!
B0001611DI|5.0|Best zombie movie ever<br /><br />Saw this as a young boy and I have never looked at zombies the same way since.
B008JFUPK8|4.0|Movie was awesome. Loved the action. I'm glad they didn't put too much of Superman and Lois Lane's love story in it. I'm so tired of watching every Superman movie and it's always about their love. If I want to watch a love story, I'll watch something like Titanic... Man of steel is for the boys who love action movies. The special effect are amazing. The only one thing I didn't like was the actor who did Superman was kinda emotionless. He needs a little practice on his acting skills.
B005LAIIGW|2.0|I hated this movie.<br /><br />anyone that is like me and likes their movies a bit on the realistic side should skip this.  That's not saying that you shouldn't see it.  Heck you might enjoy it. My daughter and wife did,  I didn't.  Great cast, great special effects, great premice.  It was just the delivery that ruined it for me.Love Sandra Bullock and have enjoyed a number of her movies, but this one failed to deliver for me.
B00004VVND|3.0|Since I am a fan of Science fiction, I enjoyed this film which I am sure many, who do not like the genera, would not enjoy. But, I can't resist a story about  an amusement park full of robots where nothing can go wrong - go wrong - go wrong - go wrong .....
B008Q08IV4|5.0|this is one of the best films I have ever seen, once I have a chance but did not finish it , should really watch it early
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|Being a huge fan of J. R. R. Tolkeins books I may be considered biased.  However, I think that Peter Jackson has done a fine job in bringing this prequel to the screen.  I can hardly wait for the release of the second part (&#34;The Desolation of Smaug&#34; to be released on 13 Dec 2013 A.D.) Like any film adaptation, the books themselves are better.  However, as with the LOTR trilogy, the changes do not ruin the story and maintain the &#34;flavor&#34; of Tolkein's original work.
B0017KIBAI|5.0|Well you can't go wrong by using originals. It works flawlessly, as expected, I use it on a Wii and with two MayFlash adapters to PC and it all works great. And it looks great. Oh yeah and the long cord is a great plus.
B0086HGW42|2.0|mediocre songs, the A-team is his one hit wonder. he's a young man with a lot of skill and panache, but he's not that good.
0452295548|5.0|Best orientation to the stroke experience and how to deal with it we have found.  Have given many copies, all appreciated.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|The story held my interest.  Great re-visit to the setting and characters. Hoping to read more about these characters. It was classic John Grisham!
1439116881|5.0|This book kept me transfixed and cost me a couple nights' sleep. EOA was handled with love and intuition. A stunning piece of fiction ( I guess!).
1742204147|2.0|Initial thoughts, before going to Japan: I'm giving it four stars now because they seem to have left out at least one important stop that people should be aware of. Okazaki, while not a big city compared to other Japanese cities, it is the place where hatcho miso is made and also where the Okazaki castle, which is associated with the Tokugawa clan.<br /><br />After going to Japan I've changed my review and am only giving this book two stars.<br /><br />When I travel I like to see the odd and unique pieces that each place has to offer. The shops, bars, clubs, and restaurants and all nice too, but they're not the main attraction. This books focuses on those though, leaving only a smattering of information about some of the true gems, especially in the Kansai region. The Chubu region has almost no useful information, especially if you want to wander off the beaten path. There is some information about, for example, the more popular castles, but that's about it. I found that stopping at the information desks in the train stations more informative and helpful than this book.<br /><br />If you're just looking to go to Japan and experience the shopping malls, restaurants and the mild night life that ends around midnight, as well as being stuck in the tourist traps, this book is for you. If you want to explore and experience the rich culture and history that is Japan, do not buy this book as it will disappoint.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I feel as close to these people as family as they move thru WW1 and then WW2 in this book. It is a very special historical drama
0061122416|5.0|Read this book as a personal experience and watch your perceptions of life grow! The author does an amazing job in provoking and emotional, spiritual, and thoughtful response from the readers.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|This game is hugely and simply entertaining!  For the price, I would recommended it to anyone.  This is a quality game.
B000ZHBB0Q|5.0|This is one of my favorite 80's movie. This is a must buy movie. It's amazing to see how young these actors are in this movie.
B005HHSYMW|5.0|Changed my thinking about violence. The world is a safer place now, but confusingly humans continue to do distasteful things to each other.
B00DXP7L88|5.0|I just wish this series never had to end. I missed the final season on Showtime, so was happy I could buy it. It does not disappoint!
1476758581|2.0|This is the very first time I'm leaving a two-star rating for a book I purchased / read. (I purchased a hard copy from a local bookstore). I give it a low rating for a simple reason - a total lack of coherence and flow. This book seeks to build on the pattern established by 'The Secret', where disparate quotations from varied sources were presented, with brief explanatory bits in between. It worked in 'The Secret', mainly because there was a clear focus that ran through everything like a string thread holding it all together. But here it's a jumbled mess!<br /><br />Also, this book seems to put the emphasis on hardwork, determination, etc and jeers at an easy, relaxed, predominantly mind-based approach, which is what was highlighted in, you guessed it, Rhonda's own 'The Secret' and subsequently in her 'The Power'. Why this contradiction, Rhonda?
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is one of my all time favorites. There are so many twists and turns I was on the edge of my seat throughout the entire book. The perfect thriller, I highly recommend it!
B00CGNYDIE|4.0|A lot more fun than I expected! Very re-playable, the controls are a tad easy to hit the wrong thing on, but otherwise an addictive, fun and thought-provoking game! I will probably buy more of these from the company.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|One of the best books I have read in a long time.... I love Grisham books but this ones stands out to be in my top 3!
B0086700CM|5.0|Fun interactive game. Challenge is to run through an open temple and jump, duck or dodge objects while collecting coins throughout.
B005L38QK2|5.0|Steelseries has always been one of the brands I dreamed I could afford. I found this mouse on sale and couldn't pass it up. I upgraded to this mouse from a Razer Deathadder, and this mouse by comparison feels better in every way. Since I game at 1080p, I am able to run this at a lower CPI (around 2400). This means the mouse runs more smoothly (the closer you run a mouse to it's maximum sensitivity, the more often your mouse is likely to skip a frame). I personally hold my mouse in a &#34;claw grip,&#34; so it's slightly smaller design doesn't deter me. The profiling software that Steelseries gives you (engine) is simple and comprehensive, but also very complete, allowing you not only to save multiple profiles, but to tie these profiles to applications. This product is well constructed in everyway, from the braided cable to the nonslip coated body, to it's incredibly accurate laser. I would highly recommend this product to any avid PC gamer.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|It's funny, heart-warming, and at our house, it's a Christmas Classic!  We watch 'Elf' multiple times every year.  Oh, and it's my 7-yr-old's favorite movie ;)
B00GFOIUVQ|2.0|i don't like having to automatically kill peeps, and i don't like the camera view. other than that it is pretty good.
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|Allie Brosh is hilarious! I cried with laughter while reading this book. It features the &#34;greatest hits&#34; from her website along with some great new stories. These simple drawings really pack a punch. It's a quick read but one I'm looking forward to reading over and over again!
B00B5HQLMI|3.0|Standard Bond fare with few new plot twists.  Starts some new faces as standard characters but that is not enough to overcome a weak plot!
B004B63M1S|4.0|A good grindhouse movie your collection.  Yes, the plot wanders over the place at points, but so what?  It was made to be like that.  A big production with a lot of money behind it, but made to look like those low-grade cheaply made, &#34;I'm spending my money to back this, and my girlfriend is starring as the lead female actress!&#34; kind of movie that you used to see at the drive-in's in the 70's.  But in an age where 99.99% of a movie is now CGI, it's nice to see the special effects of old being used.  More collections need to have movies like this in them, for when people get tired of seeing the $200,000,000 movie, and want to see something closer to the streets.
B006AZZPCM|4.0|This is fantastic! I can watch & save videos & music effortlessly. I appreciate this.  Kudos to the writers.  Thanks
B0036S4B6M|3.0|I hate to say anything bad because it is someone's reality that they chose to share with us. It just wasn't for me.
B008XG1X18|5.0|The go to place for everything you could possibly want.  I highly recommend this site to anyone who likes crafts, food and everything in between.
B000W745CU|3.0|This was a good addition to my collections of dvd and me and my grandkids enjoy it. Very good product.
B00DFBY1CE|5.0|Love! Love! Love!  This is a great cd for all blues fans.  Stephen Stills, Kenny Wayne Shepherd, Barry Goldberg... they are all so awesome.
B006GWO5NE|3.0|It worked perfect with my Kindle Fire. I got it really fast and it works well. I have had no problems with it
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I needed a calculator and since I always have my Kindle, now I always have a calculator.  And it was free.
B002ZG98Z0|5.0|I loved the first one and I got one for my friend as a gift she love it. The delivery was fast and very cheap.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is one of the best games I have ever played. It is full of adventure and I think that this is a legendary game. And you should buy it. &lt;3  (-:)
B001GCUNYO|5.0|Good movie and looks good on blue-ray. I got fast in the mail and it was very cheap for the price.
1401235425|5.0|I was never a big Bat fan as far as the books are concerned.  I've obviously read the Gospels of Miller and Moore, but the regular books didn't interest me much.  After all the incredible things I heard about Snyder and Capullo I thought I should give this run a try and these first issues are mind-blowing.  They've really brought to life a new era for the Bat that will go down in history.  I can't wait to finish this arc and get to &#34;Death&#34;.<br /><br />Read cover to cover first sitting and am currently waiting for Vol. 2 to get here.<br /><br />Have also re-read a few times so far.
B002VECM6S|5.0|I did not watch the instant video on this. It was a very good movie on dvd.  Good addition to the cheap deal
B0051UP5NQ|1.0|I bought OfficeSuite Pro 7 to work on Google docs.  The trial worked fine.  The Pro version simply gives me &#34;Network Error&#34; when I attempt to access my Google Drive.  I contacted customer support and they recommended that I download the app from their website.  This of course was a trial and they want me to activate it which would require me to buy it again.  It seems that Amazon doesn't have an easy way to get a refund so while I'll be doing that, I'm going to give up doing any document work on my Tablet.  I'm tired of wasting time sifting through office suites.  It's not that I need some super feature rich software, it's just that they don't work.
B004LWZW42|5.0|I like the entire series of these X-men movies. They are great to watch. I recieved it fast and it was cheap.
B004PYWRQC|2.0|Was not HD quality. Service buffered from time to time. Lot of pixelation was noticible. Film looked older than it was.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I had heard the talk about this series, and thought it must be hype, but all of the reviews and awards are well-deserved. This is an amazing story with fantastic actors.
B002UZXJA6|5.0|I am Irish, and Celtic Woman is my favorite Irish singing group.  I bought the CD because of the song, &#34;Amazing Grace&#34; which they do the best rendition of this song that I have ever heard.
030759565X|5.0|The recipes and text are so well thought out. The photos are beautiful. I keep this cookbook out on my kitchen counter at all times.
B001AX60KU|5.0|I bought this CD because of the song, &#34;If I Can Dream.&#34;  What a powerful song that Elvis did on this his Comeback Special.  I saw it on TV when this was originally broadcast. This CD is a wonderful reminder of that night of special songs.
B00132D808|5.0|This is by far Panic!'s best CD. If you're mad because it's completely different than A Fever You Can't Sweat Out, then you're stupid; Panic! never does the same thing on an album. This album was strongly inspired by Ryan Ross, he was literally the heart of it. You don't know what good music is if you compare this to their first album, or any of their albums in general.
B00C5R7B0I|3.0|I can't help not reading a new Scarpetta novel. But they are all much the same. Problems with Marino as always. It was good to have Lucy center stage this time and getting along with Kay. Will continue to read each new book though.
086571701X|5.0|If you are just beginning this is a great book to have in your collection, info is precise and issues are explained .
B00B1LN8WY|5.0|Such a nice package of a favorite series. Loved this show when it was on TV and I love throwing in the DVDs on a quiet day at home to reminisce a bit. Always a lot of laughs and the six characters will remain as some of my all-time favorites.
B00008GKEG|5.0|Perfect gift for my son.  He enjoys Beatles music and was very excited to get these DVDs and learn more about their history.
B006WXHJOO|5.0|I loved the movie!  I especially love the minions and this DVD has three mini-movies starring the minions so I couldn't be happier!
B0060V1WJ6|3.0|The movie was funny and romantic in a modern way. It highlights the notion that love is often messy and irrational but worth fighting for.
B00005JMXX|5.0|Great movie with a timely message.  The acting is great!  I watch this movie a lot because of the special effects and the actors.
B00E257S86|2.0|The pictures in the kindle version are just too hard to read, even in enlarged mode. Could use less words or chapters to deliver the concept.
B002A9THA8|5.0|A classic, fun movie with great dancing. A good girls night movie to watch or when you want something escapist.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Love the show, I love how the wife works so hard to support everyone including her husband, she is amazing and shows how most women have to be in this day and age to get by in life.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|so addictive and fun I cant put it down. a amazing game that keeps me intertertaned for hours at a time.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This is a good book.  The story line is interesting and it is hard to say more without spoiling it.  I would definitely recommend it.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I love this game/app, this is my first such type of game and i'm loving it!  Is there other games by fireproof!  I purchased this with my free coins which make it a really great choice.  Graphic are excellent clues are given, if needed game is challenging!  Great past time.  I've recommended this to at least four other kindle and ipad users!
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book was a true masterpiece, and included a blend of science fiction and realistic fiction. Enter Wiggin faced hardships and triumphs, but only wanted to act of his own will.I will definitely be reading the sequel to this book. Thank you Orson Scott Card!!!!!!! :)
B003EYVXSW|5.0|Weird...but I loved it.  I made the mistake of watching this with my parents, and my Dad hated it (too weird for him).  This film is def an acquired taste.
B0044DEAUA|5.0|good sound, looks good, not noticeable. I like it. The signal lasts forever too. I would definitely recommend to buy.
B007MG360G|5.0|this game was really fun but i beat i pretty guickly. (horse + horse=zebra ) if you get the game. have fun with the game! :-)
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Classic, excellent-quality, true-to-life drama that preserves the dignity and respect of the human experience, in contrast to all the dismal, superficial &#34;reality&#34; shows and violent &#34;entertainment&#34; which is our current media diet. Cleanses the palate, restores and renews faith, hope and love. After watching this, you will respect yourself and others, which is how it should be.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best game ever, i like it because you can build things and adventure around the world. i also like the multi player thing. but my kindle will not let any one join my worlds which stinks.
1595826971|3.0|The content in the book is perfect, but when I received the book in the mail, it had damage to it. The sides had dent marks, kind of like someone smacked the sides with a hammer. I'm not sure if there was an error boxing it, or if there was an error during shipping. I also know my book was not used for a fact.
B00CW6DAKC|3.0|This app is super fun but it now continuously is telling me that there is an update that I need before I can play. But every time I go to my updates, the update is not there. So now only after about 1 week of pain, I can no longer access my farm... =(
B00425S1H8|5.0|I bought this to work with my Beartracker BCT15x programming and it worked right out of the box.  Usually I have issues loading in these types of devices into my Win7 machine but not this time!!
B001NLCBJI|5.0|I may be a bit biased, but I love Bill Murray, love Scarlett Johansson, and love almost anything quirky and character-driven. In a world jammed full of &#34;You HAVE to love this!&#34; hollywood mega-movies and series, I typically geek out on anything honest and real-seeming, and this is most certainly an honest film. If the cover doesn't make you want to see it already, please give it a try :)
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|This movie is timeless.  This is my second dvd of The Polar Express.  The first one was damaged.  My family has this on our list for movies we watch at Christmas time.  I have the book and audio CD.  The movie embellishes the story, but in a good way.  I highly recommend this movie.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I haven't finished reading it but so far it is enjoyable and I will finish it before I see the movie.
B00F35B8F8|5.0|the best. really enjoyed this movie. great new cast. star trek keeps getting better. sorry shatner. you have to move over.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|Good information clearly presented by an author who has done his homework on the topic; a shorter more layperson-friendly variation on his earlier Good Fat Bad Fat.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|Another solid album from Taylor Swift.  There are several songs on this CD that could (and probably will) stand alone as hit singles. I listen to Red in my car several times a week.
B00DXPC1U6|2.0|My wife and I have been Dexter fans since the beginning.  What drew us in was the unique story line and the outstanding script writing.  Plenty of plot twists and unexpected surprises galore.  The final season was a travesty to the previous 7 seasons.  The writing was dismal.  It was sheer agony to go through each of the final 6 episodes.  What I'd highly recommend is you simply watch the final episode and save your self the pain.  Except for the death of Rita earlier in the series, the script writing stayed pretty close to the actual books.  Obviously this is why the show was so entertaining.  The final season strayed away from the original author's storyline; the show more or less went in it's own direction and this is why it failed.  I won't let out any secrets.  Suffice to say I'm in the &#34;negative&#34; camp.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The game must be really good.  my kids play it all the time.  I never get time on the kindle device where the app is running.
B0012QVJXS|5.0|As a fan of the Superman comic books Christopher Reeves pulls off the perfect Clark Kent-Superman persona, characterization...Margot Kidder as a quirky, anti-Lois Lane character, is stellar as well!
B003R50FRI|5.0|A surprising book that really opened my eyes to the beauty of poverty and nobility of criminals. Highly recommended read.
B007A4SDCG|4.0|Great concept. I recognized the idea of resistance professionally and personally. I've read all the personal development books and this one made a difference because there was no sugar coating, not technique, no programs. There is just an in your face identification of the constant battle we all wage with success and failure. It puts a face on what is keeping us from achieving our desired results. I wish that it went into more detail about overcoming resistance, but identifying it is almost as valuable.
B002ITWSUQ|3.0|Very cute movie...made me smile :) good movie for the whole family to watch. Would watch it again and again.
145210655X|5.0|DathVadar and son is about parenting and finding the funny out of uncontrollable events.<br />Hilariously fun and entertaining..even for grownups
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Super simple to use and set up, and can quickly turn your phone or tablet into a remote with the Chromecast app.
B0017I1IZA|5.0|Love her.....She is an amazing, entertaining author. Love all of her books. My friend recommended the Stephanie Plum books and I can't get enough of them....Too much fun!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Visually captivating, interesting character development, wonderful performances. If you love history, art and fine acting, this is your new show.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|good for mindless play. fun to decorate your own reef.<br /><br />pearls are hard to get though. I refuse to buy things for a game.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is great. I really like that you have different goals for each level. It keeps it interesting. Really fun game!
1455521310|4.0|I like beef stew. David Baldacci has written a nice big pot of beef stew. Everything works nicely together, but there isn't much spice, so it's kind of bland. The two main characters Sean King and Michelle Maxwell have a fun interaction going on. If you've ever seen the American TV show, King & Maxwell, shown on the TNT network, you will recognize these characters. The storyline is a bit far-fetched, and then there is the teenage boy who is told that his dad was killed, and the teenage girl, and their side story, so this book really has the feel of a made-for-TV movie.<br /><br />This is a pleasant, light, easy to read, book with plenty of action. It kept my interest. I zipped right through it. This would be a perfect beach book if it was Summer, but since it is getting cold out, I guess I would say that this is a good book to take on your Caribbean cruise. I'm sure that you can pick it up in the airport book seller on the way to catch your plane. You can read it on the deck, while sipping your tropical umbrella drink. All nice and fun. It won't disturb your sleep with nightmares.<br /><br />I give this book 3.5 Stars out of 5. Which means that it is a pleasant book, and if you like an occasional bowl of stew, I'm sure that you will enjoy this.<br /><br />I received this Digital Review Copy for free from NetGalley.com.
B00FHATBGW|3.0|Many Games by Big Fish Games are on Amazon only in Kindle version where elsewhere there is the Android version.<br />Not this case, but see Drawn for example...<br />Unlucky, those kindle tablet editions didn't download and install on Android Smartphone an Phablet. ...
B00ARI9CDQ|1.0|Most of the stuff on this site is irrelevant. I found looking through it for something worth reading a wast of time an deleted to site.
B00CPLGGXM|5.0|I think, for the money, this is a really fine piece of hardware.  The graphics are good enough to play all modern games, but don't expect to do so with highest settings.
B007OLYPW2|1.0|This book tries hard to be serious, but it is just chaotic and boring. I regret possessing it and will avoid Byatt in the future.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Love playing this between doing chore in the house . I too I involved and forget to finish chores.  Fun fun fun
0307887448|5.0|Great book.  Hated to see this book end.  The world Ernest Cline created is vivid and believable both in the 80s and the future.  Would love to see this as a movie.
B009MYARIK|5.0|I loved wedding night! I couldn't put it down! The writing was done so well that I could actually put myself into each characters shoes and feel the feelings they felt. At times I felt bad for the characters and other times happy. I was glad the story ended on a high note. A perfect yet quirky love story! Another great one for Sophie Kinsella!
B0028R3NCU|5.0|WHAT MORE CAN I SAY? IT IS WHAT IT IS AND WHEN YOU NEED SOME THING YOU TRY FOR THE BEST PRICE BUT ALSO GOOD QUALITY
B002S8AGZG|5.0|This movie is a classic. I had this movie on DVD but decided to purchase it on Blu-Ray. The transfer is a little better than on DVD.  I love the movie what can I say it still just as funny as when it first came out. I would highly recommend watching the movie if you have not.
B00005JPD0|4.0|WHAT MORE CAN I SAY? IT IS WHAT IT IS AND WHEN YOU NEED SOME THING YOU TRY FOR THE BEST PRICE BUT ALSO GOOD QUALITY
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Great show, love the acting and the story.  I'm starting at season one becaue I hate to jump into a show that I didn't start from the beginning and what a great way to do it than through Amazon.
B008Y7N7JW|1.0|kind of reminiscent of todays society, and somewhat comical in it's premise.... the kids were great though, especially Jennifer Lawrence
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Fun to play, but seems kind of easy for me so far.  Have others that I like better, even though I've seen reports that this is one of the most played games online.  Not big challenges for me yet.  Don't like the hints along the way - would rather try to figure things out on my own.  That's just me.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This game is the best game I've ever played&hellip;<br />I really like the smooth graphics and how swift the game runs
B008ANFRGQ|3.0|Pretty sure it's just me because as always there's no doubt Stevie Vai  is one of the best guitarist ever, but I thought  this cd was too slow... & I'm definitely pretty sure I was comparing it to his performance on &#34; I'm The Hell Outta here&#34; live or the &#34;Crossroads&#34; movie. Yes, my own head stuck in the 70's & 80's glam band guitar!! It&#34;s still nice to listen to, just no get up & go in my opinion! THX
B009XI7RF6|2.0|trying multiple ways to pass a level with 3 stars and still cant get it, also it is hard to get past a few levels
B00280LYHS|5.0|This series was a work of art. I started them this summer and finally just finished the last one. Thanks for writing these books!!!
B0042TV4IW|5.0|This is a very rare series because it's one the whole family can watch together. No violence, foul language, or sexual content. My grandmother could watch this without complaint because the morale values are without reproach!  Acting, scene design and writing are all superb...minute details help make it feel authentic and those details assist actors in creating characters that touch the heart and bring the audience back for more. Absolutely spectacular all the way around!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Absolutely mind blowing!<br />Could not stop reading it. Finished it in one day because it was so gripping! Excellent read!
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|it is a good read, it is not exactly a sequel but uses the same characters as an earlier book.
B00CGNYDIE|5.0|This is a fantastic logic game! I love nonograms and this is in the same category - deduction with room for occasional mistakes. There are various levels of difficulty, the puzzle sizes change, and it fits beautifully on my phone and tablet screen. I love it! I'm addicted already.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I was skeptically about this game until after listening to my sister bug me about the game, finally got it for my kindle......now I find it annoying having to wait to get more turns!!!... great time waster!!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Great device, got it before the projected delivery date, so thanks for that. Not a day goes by when I don't use the chromecast ever since I got it.
B00C5R7B0I|2.0|I didn't like this book. too clinical and lacking in character or character development. Too much technical stuff and not enough character interaction and development. i really didn't like this one. Maybe Cornwell just put anything together. I like her characters and in her next book I hope they are developed better.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This book is a must read!! But make sure that you have read Divergent and Insurgent first!! One you finish this book you life will be changed forever! Once u finish you might want to watch and interview with Veronica Roth on MTV. It will help u understand what your feeling. Please read this book!!!
B00EW9GQR6|1.0|Sucks Big Time!  She sounds like she's going to slit her wrists.  Most of the songs are sad and depressing.  So very disappointed.
B000P46QTA|5.0|I thought the movie to be well scripted and well acted.  Especially enjoyed the Stasi agent who underwent a transformation a little akin to that of Ebenezer Scrooge.  George Will on the Fox Sunday morning news show recommended it as a way of understanding Angela Merkel's early  experience in East Germany and why she reacts as she does to being monitored by the NSA.
B000FC1JCQ|4.0|I am still reading it. I am now on book 4 (this contains the entire series). If you like myths like King Arthur, and fairies and druids, you may like this. If you are a strict Christian and cannot tolerate any other views or any views that don't agree with yours, you may not like this.
B005OCFGTO|2.0|The package had a little piece broken inside, i really did not espectate that , it is not that important but it really ruined the package
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|So easy to navigate and quick too. I had another dictionary that took forever to look up anything on my Kindle. This is fast and easy to use.
1439190275|4.0|Bought this as a refresher. Between a low-carb diet and intermittent fasting a lifelong weight problem is finally controlled. Clearly written and informative, but there isn't really anything here that you can't just find on the internet (blogs, YouTube, etc...). But it is handy to have it all in one book.<br /><br />I'm guessing the added focus on leafy greens and other vegetables was bowing to pressure from the medical community, but vegies are never bad for you so it's OK advice.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Yeah I love to play this game on the computer on Facebook. But now it looks cool and one thing I notice you don't have a avatars. But still fun hope you don't have to have friends send you stuff really holds the game up
B004J4WKTW|5.0|An excellent book to awaken your imagination. Full of wonderment and vivid description. It will take you on a trip to the circus. AND THIS IS NOT YOUR.  Typical RUN OF THE MILL Circus. I was sad that the book ended. o
B00G32OER4|4.0|Good movie in the horror genre that wasn't filled with profanities and sex, which is very refreshing. I enjoyed it.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|It was very unforeseeable. I couldn't predict what was going to happen next. I loved this book. I think Robert Louis Stevenson did a great job at writing Treasure Island. It's interesting and a very good adventure book. It made me feel like I was actually there on the island. I absolutely love books like these. I love getting lost in them when I have had a bad day. Treasure Island has helped me do that. I hope other people like this book like I have.
0393317552|3.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Dr. Diamonds earlier book &#34;The Third Chimpanzee&#34; but this one is a chore to read. The title &#34;Guns, Germs and Steel&#34; is a bit misleading because there are really only two significant subjects are germs and steel. The author continually stresses the effects of germs on the &#34;new world&#34; inhabitants as though germs were a secret weapon used by Europeans to massacre  civilizations and conquer the Americas. The significant weapon was &#34;none of the above&#34;.<br /> It was technology.<br /> The author seems to be attempting to place a &#34;guilt trip&#34; on the reader for what he considers injustices committed by every explorer and Conquistador since Columbus on up until the Americas were &#34;conquered&#34;.<br />  No thank you. No one had any idea of what a microbe was at that time and they certainly did not attempt to use infection as a weapon to eradicate and subjugate New World Civilizations.<br />  The only difference between the conquerors and the conquered was the ROUTE they used to reach the New World. They both had essentially the same origin.<br /> Man was imperfect then and he is imperfect now, life is tough, and it is not fair.<br />  There are a lot of opinions expressed by the author, a lot of inferences and intuitive analyses with no scientific citations or footnotes to support them.<br /> The repeated implications that Europeans &#34;used&#34; germs as a weapon against those who lacked European immunities is tiring.
0316204366|4.0|Well written and true to Malcolm Gladwell's typical writing style.  Very engaging and a quick read.  He again looks at situations from a unique perspective and makes you question some long held opinions.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I have to say that I have always enjoyed this type of game and this one I do believe is quite possibly the best I have played in this genre.  I am playing on a Kindle Fire<br />HD and have had no problems with the game. The graphics though a little small are still easily seen. The music is nice and I have not felt like I have to turn it off. All in all a really fun game!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|What can you say about this classic.  My daughter is defintely into Star Wars, so this was a perfect choice for her.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game. Mind numbing fun. Love the challenge and rewards.my kids enjoy it as well. I hope to play more often.
B0045H6V8Y|5.0|The little boy in this film should have received most of the praise.  Good movie and he was definitely the star.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|I am so glad I bought these! I have watched them several times already. Great go-to show. It's a classic.
B00EPFEY44|5.0|Andrea Bocelli is the best tenor singer I have ever had the pleasure of hearing and the man can sing anything. Love in Portofino is a beautiful album of very romantic love songs. Very well done. I will treasure for ever.
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|Not sure, only just started playing, I liked the other one on my computer but wouldn't work well enough to play more often, I'll have to get back to you if this is as good or better
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I played Candy Crush for a long time.  I picked it up through the Google Play Store for free (as it is here), and loved it.  I recently uninstalled it because I started wasting so much time on it.  I found myself just waiting for my turns to come available.  It was too much to resist.<br /><br />Sadly, as a result, I uninstalled it.  If you have the time to play, this game is addicting!  If you don't have the willpower to ignore it, however, you may be in for a rough ride as it is one of the more addicting games that I have played.
B004SIP6A4|5.0|.. the truth?  Atypical! ;-)<br /><br />It's about time they made a really good musical film.<br /><br />Pros: This blu-ray is accompanied with several audio tracks.  Blu-ray PCM 5.1 channel 24 bit, AAC Compressed Dolby Digital 16 bit, PCM 2.0 channel 24 bit, PCM 2.0 channel 16 bit .<br /><br />Cons: About the only musical performed without interruptions, appears to be Cell Block Tango.  This Blu-ray version (and likely DVD versions as well) do not include the musicals in their entirety without interruptions.  The musical features included are a split view of their making and final performances with director and actor comments.  With the availability of the PCM 5.1 24 bit audio streams, it would have been really nice to provide the musical performances so people would not have to also buy the CD soundtrack.  Or, the CD/DVD soundtrack should have been included with the movie!<br /><br />For people whom purchased the Blu-ray and you're computer literate, can likely extract the Cell Block Tango audio using the following after legally copying the relevant audio stream.  In other words, 1380 is the start position and 18480 (start pos + t offset) is the ending position.  (Otherwise if you're wanting the audio only musicals, will need to also buy the soundtrack CD.)<br /><br />ffmpeg -i stream.wav -ss 1380 -t 460  -acodec copy  CellBlockTango.wav<br /><br />When dealing with music Blu-ray media, I usually extract all available stream types (ie. PCM 5.1, PCM 2.0 24 bit, PCM 2.0 16 bit, AAC/AC3/A52 Dolby/DTS) and divide each song into their individual tracks.  I do this for all my music media, and reserve hunting for the original media for Movie DVD's and Blu-rays, with Blu-rays being optional as I have no choice but to convert them as I use Linux.  (God how I dislike Blu-ray media and HDMI!  But am pro copyright here as people have to make a living.)
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very fun and addictive. Quite challenging! Would like more free bonuses but other than that it is great. It us also fun seeing friends progress along the path.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|I've always loved the Columbo shows and already watched the first entire season via Amazon Video.<br /><br />\\"Columbo: The Complete Series\\" is published on DVD, as the show was only broadcast via television quality, making it easily watchable for Linux users.<br /><br />A nice addition for anybodies Movie library at home!<br /><br />Pros:<br />1) Supposedly includes every show and every Movie!<br />2) Dolby 2.0 16 bit audio, and connecting to a home stereo via S/PDIF and using the stereos's 5-channel upmixing creates an adequate sound or audio field, with immersion.  (If I'm not mistaken, the stream is a two channel audio and enhanced using Dolby Digital.  It doesn't do much in of itself, until the home stereo upmixes to 5 or 7 channel audio.)<br />3) One of the best episodes so far, \\"Forgotten Lady\\".  And the shows just keep getting better!
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|this game is a real good game. I installed it but then it took up a lot of space on my kindle so I uninstalled it. it is really fun for all ages. I an 12 and a relative of mine who is 15likes it. it just take up a lot of space. I reinstalled it because it was such a fun game I could not just not play it! it would be 5 but I just needed more space for notebook for school because we can take notes on our kindle in my scjool. if I were u I would get it
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|It was on sale and I wanted to see it.  I like watching movies in 3D.  I will share this with others.
B00ACP3OOM|4.0|While this mp3 does not have the clarity associated with the rocket style in ear plug it is far more comfortable for lengthy swims.  Works better for strokes where head stays in water.<br />Pros.  Comfort. Fairly easy to set up before swim. Easy to load. Can still hear when out of water.<br />Cons. Not as clear (wouldn't recommend audio books)
B006LSZECO|5.0|Everything about this book was different. The plot,the writing style,characters were all exciting.  Thanks to Amazon for dropping the price so that I would purchase.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Entertaining and difficult to put down. I enjoyed the story and characters and I appreciate the fact that each book is an appropriate length for a series. Often authors will take one story line and break it into multiple small books simply to generate more revenue. I do not believe Rothfuss has done that with this series.
B005COO1X6|3.0|I didn't dislike it, but it was really too scary for me. And...I am a Stephen King fan. Brrrrrr. I usually read in the evening and I was turned off and didn't finish it. Nightmare stuff.
B00AYBU7TE|5.0|If you are a Johnny Cash fan, this is a wonderful addition to his many other great albums.  You won't regret the purchase.
1600597963|5.0|I highly recommend this book because it is not only an instructional tool, but it is also A VISUALLY STIMULATING WORK OF ART… REAL EYE CANDY!<br /><br />I looked inside several books on bead embroidery before making a decision on which one to buy and this was one of my top choices.  When I received the book, I was more than pleased because it is absolutely beautiful.<br /><br />Not only is it beautiful but the instructions and drawings are clear, the designs are stunning and the color combinations are simply elegant.  For a person who knows something about bead embroidery, the book is worth the price for the photos alone, and there is no shortage of photographs of variations for each technique.  Plus, the author also gives some good tips on how to handle different challenges that may arise with the use of different stones and shapes.<br /><br />If you are a beginner, this book gives good basic information on design, different materials and “how-to” instructions.  For a person who can follow written instructions and diagrams, I believe even a beginner could master some of the techniques, but even if it is a little advanced for some, the photos will inspire you to learn the basics and get better so you can grow to the level of some of the designs and techniques.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|I was mesmerized by this film.  The beauty, Pi's life experience.  It touches the soul.  I rarely watch a movie twice and I ended up watching this one twice in one week.  I highly recommend it.
B00F0N7JUG|5.0|Amazing film, amazing Collector's Edition. Fat chunk of content in Special Features, the UltraViolet copy has since jumped like 5 devices easily. I wanted to support this film the best way I could after watching it 3 times at theaters, and I feel like this was it.
B003G4W49C|5.0|The book was so good It is about Alina's and humans an capitals lets go ender and his friends yah,
0446310786|5.0|One of the great American novels and the quintessential book for trial lawyers.  Better to have written one great book than a lifetime of very good ones.
B00BPDR3F6|4.0|This is a \\"traditional\\" novel that follows a single and singular life throughout its course.  The choice of botany as the driving passion is both interesting and \\"remindful\\" of our essential connection to all living things, as well as a useful treatise on the pace at which discoveries were made a mere 100 years ago.  The heroine is a complex character, not always likeable, but ineffably human.
B0052TDGQO|5.0|Country music has always been my favourite type of music and Scotty totally rules.  You are the best ever in the world.  Keep up the excellent work.
B003RV43X4|1.0|The movie is terrible. The creatures were poorly envisioned, the acting without conviction, and the story uninspired. I will not watch the sequel.
0761172726|5.0|Love this calendar. Perfect for the busy mom and family. Very easy to use and keep everyone organized at glance Used it for years and will continue!!!
B00007KWHG|5.0|I love Frankie Valli & The Four Seasons and this CD had I think every one of their hits.  I'm really enjoying it.
B00632HWOG|1.0|Too many ads load before you can open the mail.  Ads changing all the time and blocking you activity on email. To put it bluntly, since they made changes several months ago  IT SUCKS.
B005MLOOJA|4.0|The characters and personal drama is excellent. Stellar actors.  The legal aspects of show, however, are completely far-fetched.  It seems there is no legal consultant advising the writiers.  That is my only complaint.
B00F91SCXC|3.0|Just your typical zombie movie. I didn't see any difference between this one and all the others. I am Legend, is better.
B0015GH5RY|1.0|The movie itself is excellent but the streaming kept messing up an stopping the movie which became extremely annoying so much so stopped watching it.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Liked the follow up on &#34;A Time to Kill&#34;. Would have liked it better, if there was more action in the middle. Seemed like most of the action happened in the last quarter of the book.
B00D7Z4GQY|2.0|I did not care for the style. I could not stay interested for more than 3 pages at the time. Also, the story is too predictable.
B000V6738U|5.0|Brings back memories of the 70's.  Really enjoyed this album.  There are a lot of great songs on this album.
B000W799NU|1.0|my DVD did not work, and now i have to go through all the troube to return it and reorder.  I love the movie, just didn't like the whole transaction.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|This game is fun to play. I could play this game all day. It is the best game that is out there.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Unbelievable tale of complex and mystical adventures.  Amazing mind to conjure this world and make you feel a part of it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is fun and addictive! Everyone warned me about playing, but I didn't listen! It's easy to play and you finish levels fast.
B003VWU2WA|3.0|Back in the day it was a nice useable product. With the lack of current drivers it's difficult to use… Still works nice IF you can get it to work with your system.
0765334798|3.0|There was a lot of potential here, but I felt it was just wasted. I'm not saying it wasn't entertaining, because parts of it were very amusing. However Scalzi created an interesting riff and then some strong emotional/psychological implications but dropped them to no purpose.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Deeply moving and compelling reading!  The author elicits a wide range of emotions, and the characters stay with you long after the book is finished.  This is a story based on truth that will hold adults and young adukts spellbound.
B00BFIFIPS|4.0|Very nice case! Adds some color/style to the iPhone but keeps its minimal form factor. Offers a fair amount of protection, as well. Plus the color casing is interchangeable so you can alter the style as you like! Another home run from SGP.<br /><br />Comes with a case and jelly home buttons - no screen shield.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|It continues the series perfectly. I couldn't ask for any more! I stayed up all night finishing it! I love it!!!
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|My 2 yr old son loves this movie. we watch it almost daily. so colorful, fun, storyline is simple, what a great creation, so happy to learn about this dvd. we went to a sushi place saw a Totor poster asked the waiter about it, then I researched Totoro and found this movie.  we bought 3 posters and have them up in my sons room.
B009SJ3GUK|2.0|Amazon... your player sucks. I couldn't watch this.<br /><br />Apparently a one line review is also inadequate for amazon.<br />Dammit amazon.<br /><br />American Horror story rocks tho
B00005JLEU|5.0|not so good for my 2 yr old, it scares him. It will be avail for him when he gets a little older. he watches Totoro and Ponyo daily. love the animation, colors, voices, and such talent.
B009AMANBA|3.0|Given the title of the film, I was expecting a story about one of the most intriguing presidents in our nation's history.  That was not the case.  Instead of being an autobiographical film about President Lincoln, this film's main topic is about how the 13th Amendment was passed.<br /><br />That is the problem of the film.  That is not as compelling or interesting of a story.  Do you really want to watch a 2 and a half hour production of politicians fighting and making backroom deals?  Of course you do not.  That is why this film is a bore.<br /><br />Yes, the actors are great.  The screenplay is well written.  That is not the problem.  The problem is that the story is about a much less interesting topic.<br /><br />President Lincoln is a very interesting person.  He was not always so gung ho about ending slavery.  It was not until later on in his life that he felt strongly against slavery.  What caused this president to change his mind?  Too bad for you.  That is not the story being told in this film.<br /><br />What this tells me is that you cannot make a good film about Lincoln.  I think a miniseries would be a better option.  It would be able to give a more in depth look of one of the most interesting men and one of the most interesting presidencies in our history.<br /><br />Hopefully, one day, someone will be up to task to take on such a project.
0385523394|5.0|Great book! Different than the show but way more informative, such an interesting look into the prison system. Was funny and a pretty quick read
B007J4T2G8|1.0|First 5 chapters read as if they were written by an adolesent. Bored and uninspired. Didn't want to read any further. Just bought it to see what all the flap is about.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This book was a surprise for me.  It started out a little slow but it was so worth it.  Every detail given to you in those first chapters was essential in bringing you closer to the characters and into their lives.  I found this book to be amazing!  The character devolpment was great and the epilogue was perfect!  I truly enjoyed this book and would recommend it to everyone.
B005CRQ2XA|5.0|this book was a really good book i got interested in it and read it in one night:) thanks for making this good book
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is the BEST game I've ever played in my LIFE! There is all sorts of things that you can do like decorate your park so more visitors can come to your park and have fun. You can also breed or buy dragons from the market my favorite Dragon is the SUN DRAGON Which is the hardest Dragon to breed in the whole game! I already have 1 of them in my Park! I LOVE this game SO much that I will give you the combination of the SUN DRAGON.(Ash Dragon+Storm Dragon<br />=Sun Dragon in day + 48 hours!) I think you should get this game NOW!
B00FHATBGW|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this game. The graphics were great and had a good storyline. Lots of places to visit and puzzles to solve.
B00EV6T6DQ|5.0|Beautifully drawn, Blue is the Warmest Color hits you  the gut while caressing your hand. Martin's illustrations with few words give better life to a complex story than prose could.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I don't have to rely on the TV to view the entire weather up-dates. This so convenient to have<br />This information handy any time anywhere. Living in the state of Florida it really is a helpful tool.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|This series is awesome! I was intrigued by the first book. Then, compulsive about the second one. The third was a must have selection...so much so that I bought it, lost it and repurchased it. Mrs. Roth is a very talented young author. Her insights are wonderful gifts to her readers. Wish those insights into human nature would have blessed my life when I was a young adult! Yet all things come at the optimal time for everyone. May her young readers understand and internalize her teachings about life. A very good book and an excellent series. I highly recommend it.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Amazing responds to the touch and such beautiful color display. I truly enjoy the convenient to be able to stay in touch with my.children and friends.
0062255657|5.0|Haunting.  So well written you get hooked into the characters and believe every possibility.  Not easy to put down.  You decide what is real
B00D23GXB2|5.0|Revenge of the Orgasm (The Lust Series) is a book I normally wouldn't buy, but I am a big fan of poetry, so I decided to give it a try.  These poems are a fun and hot.  I think these would be wonderful to read to your lover. You'll love these poems again and again. This is definitely a group of poems you'll find yourself returning to and if you need to spice up your love life in the bedroom....these will help you get started.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|This app is so good thank you I really enjoyed this app I will recommend this app to other people I'm
B00BKZUVGM|2.0|This was a pretty disappointing conclusion to what started out as an awesome series.  I feel like the split between the points of view of Tris and 4 didn't really add much except to confirm that they 'really' loved each other.  Divergent was definitely the best book of the series by a long way.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I am very happy with you at I enjoy so much I would recommend it to other people Eddie so satisfied I enjoy so much
B002U3CCKQ|3.0|This book was pretty dark but very interesting nonetheless.  The story was engrossing and I was genuinely interested to see the truth of the crime come out.  But I didn't really 'enjoy' reading this as the main protagonist was so depressed that it was sometimes hard to keep going with it.  At times it felt like a slog, which I think was the point, as Libby Day is depressed and having to drag her way through life.  But I think anyone who has had experience with depression might find some aspects of this pretty difficult to read.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love this app so much people should try it out is so helpful thank you very much for whoever I created this app play
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|..it would really be great if you could play for as long as you want without waiting for new &#34;lives.&#34;
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I'm very happy with this app thank you I will tell people about this app I really enjoy bye bye thank you
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|The best Bond movie in a long time! It's highly entertaining and I thoroughly enjoyed watching it. Great for a movie night at home.
B0032UYFA6|2.0|The show was great but the copy was pirated and the subtitles did not work.  When I got the movie, it was wrapped in plastic wrap instead of the hard to open celleophane.
B005PK56TA|5.0|This show is creepy as hell. Its given me nightmares. Watch it if you like creepy weird tales of ghosts and horror!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Very awesome game so realistic and very fun to play never gets old each level is more fun then the next I love how you can upgrade your current gun or guns.
B00COWOXGE|5.0|Outstanding movie, especially Tommy Lee Jones.  He definitively deserved the best supporting actor award for this performance as the Federal Marshal in pursuit of the &#34;Fugitive&#34; .
B003G4W49C|5.0|So cool and exiting not long finished in 2days easily. And I ask for more MORE MORE<br /><br />A perfect book
B00EGMQIJ0|3.0|The story is one that could well happen and makes you think about the choices you make and what you share online (like this review). The plot itself follows an obvious path and there are no real surprises in the book.<br /><br />Worth the read if only to improve your awareness of the perils of social media.
B009VA1FN6|5.0|This story took me on several journeys as each character developed, but it wasn't until the final pages that the truth was revealed.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Like this game, but don't like how you run out of lives so fast. Then you have to wait forever to play again. Nit otherwise it's a fun game
0545626382|5.0|Love it!!! Finished the first book. Now, I can read all of them and share with my friends. Can't wait to read them all.
B00BC254I8|3.0|I like Mike Tyson.  I think he is a complex, interesting person.  I thought the book was poorly written.  It could have been at least a third shorter.  There was just way too much repetition of Mike's sex, drugs, and alcohol and although written in Mike's &#34;voice&#34; at times came across as a high school essay of &#34;what i did this past summer&#34;.  It tended to crowd out the more interesting parts of the book about different characters in the fight game (i.e. Don King), Mike's self reflection about his life and why he is who he is.  Some will say the writer needed to elaborate on all the carrying on by Mike, but at some point it became boring and I found myself just trying to skip it.<br />He's had a remarkable life and happy to read about how he's turned it around.  I would  definitely go see the movie or the one man show, but not sure I'd recommend the book.
B00F1W1SS0|5.0|Its awesome how a  20 year band still delivers power and talent. I need to be sincere, this Concert is not my favorite from them in terms of camera angles and sound quality, The camera angles are sloppy at times, and Myung is almost missing...Whyyyy? In sound quality the voice of Labrie takes an emotional passage throughout the show, but at times, its just out of tune (but not horribly). I was listening to Scenes from NY cd, and the sound of every instrument just sounded perfectly balanced....here, some of the instruments feels overpowered by the guitar, depending on the song. The drumming is great, but if you compare it to Scenes from NY, it sounds muffled, it just dont has that &#34;thumping&#34; sound. I think the mixing could be better, BUT RATHER THAN THAT, ITS A MUST BUY FOR EVERY ONE, FAN OR NOT. TALENT DONT NEED FANS, JUST MIND AND ATTENTION....and dont miss the documentary, is beautiful! I was going to rate it 4/5 but the documentary made change my mind so 5/5!!! This band deserves it!!!
B00FVVR2ZO|3.0|I do like the game. Would have given more stars except for the fact that it won't let me add friends. I do wish you would make a game like this where you didn't have to add people in order to get items needed to play.
B00B5HQLMI|3.0|Interesting to see so many five star ratings on this one. My guess is that reflects a generational split between those of us who saw all the Bond films from the beginning (less impressed) and those who are late to the party and prefer and more Bourne-like Bond, which Craig has always been. This is a far better offering than the dreadful Quantum of Solace but still fell a bit short in my view.  I will agree it is perhaps the most visually interesting Bond in a while. The Instanbul and Shanghai sequences were particularly beautiful and the opening chase scene was very impressive, even if you HAVE to wonder how even Bond could have survived that fall off the bridge at the end of the chase. The action is all downhill from there and ending was perhaps the least spectacular of any Bond film to date. As some others have noted, the movie does suffer from a lack of sense of humor, which was always a part of the earlier movies. Much too dark. Way too serious. But again, that's what's popular (the many Dark Knight comparisons) so Hollywood is only too happy to oblige. Interesting to see so many supporting characters rebooted but that was overdue. The thuggish Craig should join the parade and let someone younger and more debonaire take over as Bond. Not a bad movie but not a great one either. It was a little too stilted too dark and, in the end, somewhat flat, I would put it behind the more interesting Casio Royale (Craig version).
B00G9U7R2O|5.0|Great Family Movie!!!  My kids watched it twice.  It's nice every once in awhile to have a disney movie come out that adults, kids and Teenagers Love.
B008Y7N7JW|1.0|Hate the concept, kids killing kids for sport. However my wife loves the movie and book.  Go figure! A very successful movie, but I don't care to ever see it again!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad I can finally play this game on my kindle!  There are many games similar, but none as fun as the original.
B00B5HQLMI|2.0|I did force myself to watch the entire movie in the hope of something more than just mildly entertaining.  This is yet another underdeveloped, over-produced, superficial, imitation Bond flick.  I do like the idea of the plot and there are some good cinematic shots in the movie, but other than that it would be more interesting as a silent picture because the viewer would be forced to use an imagination of which none is present.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|He always spins a great tale of court drama .You are immediately transported to a place  that keeps you on the edge of your seat
B00GH4RKYM|3.0|Good movie, but it tried to force a lot of superman history into 2 hrs.  Fight scenes were excellent!  Had to watch it twice to really get the storyline.
B003QTBT5C|5.0|saw this band live and blew me away. Had to get this CD to experience how 4 cello playing musicians who are so TALENTED and musically educated can ROCK I mean ROCK it in a way I could never think possible.  Love it and so glad I was able to see them live
B00BD99JMW|1.0|SERIOUSLY! (SPOILER ALERT!)<br /><br />I lost all interest in seeing the movie JUST because of the ending of this book.  I wonder if the financial backers of the movie KNEW she was going to kill of the heroine at the end of the series.  She left EVERY person empty and broken because they loved her so much - and then poof... she dies. WTH??? The first two books were fantastic, strong lead woman who, although still a girl, was willing to stand toe to toe with her boyfriend and tell him he needed to figure himself out more.  So many books in the Teen realm seem to want to hook girls up with guys who mentally abuse them... this one isn't one of those - which was soooo refreshing.<br /><br />But then the author rewards the reader with the message that ''Who cares how hard you fight, your gonna die and everyone you love is going to live heartbroken&#34;  - this ending sucked.
034580404X|5.0|well what can be said of this trilogy.  got this as heard Wendy Wiliams gushing about it on her show.  before this I had not even heard of it.  glad I got this series of books.  the first and second book were good, but the third was so-so.  wanted to read it as everyone was reading it and wanted to see what the hype was.  not bad overall
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|lousy ending. EMPTY hearted, no soul.  Felt like Katniss ended up with whom she did - just because he came home with her. grrr
B000SUKPKM|5.0|Have loved the Goo Goo Dolls since they arrived on the music scene. Fortunate enough to have seen them live in which I heard their songs and decided to get this as a lot of my faves of theirs is on it.  Iris and Slide are awesome and love listening to them over and over.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|A story of family, race and the aftermath. A lawyer determined to honor an estate of a man he has never metm
B000001DTM|5.0|I have loved U2 since they arrived in the 80's which to was one of the best eras for the music world.  This CD was their best before they broke to Zooropa and changed.  Every song on this CD is amazing and got it as my original CD was lost.
B00E9HML1Q|5.0|Great movie! The extended edition is even better; you get some information that is extremely relevant to the story (e.g. the black arrows). As with the extended LOTR movies, the bonus material is excellent, and really details how much work went into making the movie. It's almost worth the extra cost just to have the bonus documentaries!! The WETA statue is cool, and looks great with the figurines that came with the LOTR boxed sets.
B004YM6JP0|5.0|was not able to catch a lot of the season so I decided to get this to catch up and follow the series.  One of the best series out there and keeps one wanting more with the love triangle.
B00EY7LT9Q|5.0|So far this is one of the best shows on television in recent memory, and that's considering that I am a huge fan of Grimm and Once Upon a Time. Agent Phil Colson (recently back from &#34;Tahiti&#34; where he recovered from being stabbed through the heart by Loki in The Avengers) leads a capable but fairly dysfunctional team who can pool their creativity well.<br /><br />Comic-book violence, not much blood, maybe a bit intense for the kiddos, but definitely worth a watch.
1439181780|5.0|Was not a big fan of The Power, The Magic.  When I purchased this and started to read it, I was like this book was an inspiration and assists one into discovering the power we all possess to make our life and living better through power of positive thinking and how through this our perception of the world around us will change.  I actually read it over and over.
B001992NUQ|5.0|Has to be one of my favorite movies of all time. The casting was perfect. Norton, Pitt and  Carter are perfect as the dysfunctional couple (you have to read or see it to understand that) and Meatloaf Aday is excellent in his role. Perhaps a bit too strange a movie for some people, but a definite gem.
006202406X|5.0|This book is an amazing book and really well written. But, there are a few parts that she could have expanded on a little more. Overall it is an amazing book and I couldn't put it down. Besides what everyone's saying I really liked the ending and thought that it had to happen.
0062080237|5.0|This is an amazing book and I loved every word of it.  It is a masterful blend of mythology, travel, humor and wonderful characters.
0061726834|2.0|This book was great for about the first 3/4 of it I just kept waiting for something big to happen. Then in the last 1/4 of the book it was like she was in a hurry to finish it. She dropped the whole beginning of the book like it never happened and the main character does all kinds of things she wouldn't have done without any real character motivation.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|The first time I played this game I was not impressed. Then I saw my daughter playing and decided to give it another try. Now I have this game on my Kindle and my phone. I play it at least twice a day and I'm so addicted!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I love this game but cannot stand the time in between to play. Why can't we buy it and play it continuously ????  I would pay for this. Please update so we have a choice  please!!!!!
B00G9U7R2O|4.0|Not as good as the first movie for 4-7 year olds. Too much dialog looses this audience. Rent don't buy.  My son doesn't want to see it again, but like it the first time.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is great for the kids. fun and educational. both of my child sit and play for hours on end. hands together for Nordcurrent
B005H9B2CE|5.0|This is one of those movies where your experience is completely dependent on what you're expecting.  I didn't have high hopes for this one, but I was pleasantly surprised.  Chris Hemsworth did a brilliant job and the cinematography and CG was fantastic.  I'm sorry I didn't watch this sooner.  I can't wait to see the sequel.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Works pretty good most of the time.  Must allow some buffering during some movies but overall satisfied. I will be purchasing another soon
B009RX7IX8|5.0|I love this show - so well written and so fun to watch!  It is fun to see the all the character development with each passing season.
B004LROUNG|5.0|As always I was not disappointed by this author.  The story kept me captivated.  I wouldn't mind a sequel with David Zinc.
B008KW43TE|3.0|A few tracks are good, but most are kind of mediocre. Definitely an over-hyped album. Frank Ocean's voice isn't even that distinct from every other R&B singer out there. If he doesn't make some new fresh stuff soon, he will fade into mediocrity.
B00422LESO|4.0|I began to read this after watching the movie trailer for it.  I love the ending!  I look forward to reading it again soon.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved it. Great second book in the series. Cant wait for the movie. Jennifer is great as Latinas and Jena will be great as johanna
B00B0LPWU6|2.0|This movie could have been a modern day Antigone. Instead, it's an asinine heavy moral lecture about the evil of alcoholism.<br /><br />[spoiler alert]<br /><br />The premise of the movie is that the pilot is a wretched alcohol and cocaine addict with an uncanny ability to fly a plane. Despite being drunk and stoned, his instinct and heroics helped saved most of the lives on a fateful flight in an impossible situation. In fact, 10 sober pilots tried the simulation of the incident and no one could save the plane from a free dive and killing everyone on board. Although investigation cleared him for being responsible for the incident, ultimately he decided to admit for being drunk thus became automatically guilty for manslaughter. And even though he is in jail, he is a happy man free of his devil.<br /><br />It's a given that flying a plane while drunk is usually a recipe for disaster, just as breaking the laws are bad and evil most of the time. But even back in the ancient Greek, the question has been raised: there is always exception to the rule, and what do you do about these exceptions? Here is this pilot, flying better than everyone else while drunk. Actual, he could function extreme well in a physical condition that would knock out most people. Is he living a wretched live? Yes. Should the airline continue let him fly? I certainly won't feel secure knowing my pilot is drunk. But is he guilty of killing those who died in that crash? Heck no! This is a logic false equilvance that goes like this -- flying while drunk could cause flight accidents; There was this flight accident involving a drunk pilot. Therefore, the drunk pilot is guilty of manslaughter despite that all the evidences prove otherwise. In a rational, sane world, this pilot would lose his license but should have never gone to jail. But as a popular country song goes &#34;...people are crazy&#34;. And they have been for millenniums. This movie could have explored into the hows and whys on such absurd punishments are dished out. Instead, the movie gives a heavy-handed moralistic lecture -- alcohol addiction is bad, doing drug is bad. Don't do it or you're a criminal. That's why I gave this movie a two stars. 4 stars for Denzel Washington's acting. He is always a wonderful actor. Minus two stars for this inane movie, which comes out a net two stars.<br />Here is your food for thought of the day. The flight crew knew the pilot's alcohol problem all these time. They can smell the reek of liquor on his body. Yet no one ever bother to report him to the authority. Shouldn't the flight crew, or the airline for that matter, be guilty of negligence? How come no one makes a fuss about that in the movie?
B00F522C7C|5.0|I saw this with my daughter in the theater and she absolutely loved it. It was such a fantastic experience and amazing to share with her. I will always cherish it and am greatly looking forward to giving her the DVD for Christmas! :) She is beside me now and I'll go ahead and ask her what she thought. I'll type it below.<br /><br />My Daughter says &#34;I liked Dusty. He flies in the sky. I love Chupacabra. I love when Dusty got rain on him.&#34;<br /><br />Well, that's what my 4 year old thought. She always gets so excited when she sees anything planes. We'll be watching this Christmas day! :)
B004RJMUJO|5.0|I use to only use the free version then I got the payed for and is is so much better less ads. It has more blades and backgrounds I lobe the addition of star fruit
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|After all this time I have finally. tried candy's crush saga. Everybody and their grandmother. have been sending me requests on FB. I like it :*)
B001L5YW9I|5.0|I really enjoyed the historical overview of the French and Indian War and the struggle in early America.  Add this to some incredible scenery and action and you have a great movie!
B009LGO88E|5.0|It definitely does what it promises to. No regrets and no complaints! My husband loves his Circle Pad Pro. He uses it a lot and it work great.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Movie is awesome, have great action plus is the best movie ever. Hulk was better ca rector of the movie
B001EN71CW|5.0|Love this show and was very happy to get the blu-ray edition. The extras are fun to watch as well.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Can't, stop playing. Make it stop. I told myself I would never play this, then I started and never stopped.
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|One of the most interesting chronicles of Rock & Roll history yet.  It's amazing to see who made their career start through this studio.<br />The music is great, the contributions from involved personnel answer so many questions about the evolution of music. Loved it, will watch again and again. So many memories from that era.
B00EKXDVOK|5.0|Like butter - that's the only way to describe her voice.  No one else has/or will come close in my opinion.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this game. Very in depth puzzles. If you enjoy using your brain in games, I highly recommend it to you.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|Compelling story. Great writing. Love all the art history references. My only criticism would be that  the unfolding of time is sometimes a little confusing but not enough to detract from my overall enjoyment.
B00C81LYH2|5.0|This is a Christmas present for my grandaughter - I can just see the twinkle in her eyes when rips off the gift paper.
1579655327|4.0|Beautiful art. Stories to be told. Not many recipes.<br />Only 86 dishes in a 340 pages book. At the end it is almost an art book due to its precious art and design.<br />Lots of pictures. Many stories of different cooks.<br />Although I am not sorry I´ve bought it do not get it if you are only interested in the recipes.
B00BIPCY14|5.0|This series is extremely entertaining and has so many twists and turns that I could hardly wait to watch the next episode.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Not my favorite Stephen king read, but it is a fitting sequel. I recommend for people in AA or those considering- it's inspiring in that sense as a side note
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Love this series!  This is unique and totally engaging.  Must start with the first one ( divergent ) but all three books are fascinating and well worth it.  It can be enjoyed on several levels, just for the story or as a comment on society.  You enter this world and really become part of it.  If you liked hunger games you will like this.
1118109791|5.0|Just took the GMAT today and could not recommend this book more. I used it in conjunction with Manhattan GMAT strategy guides (that I would totally recommend since they give you an order with which to approach these questions). It was very similar to the GMAT content in difficulty and content. On my official GMAT I had questions that were extremely similar to the ones in this book. Use it!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love this show. Great, can't wait for next season. There always seem to be a twist at every turn. Very entertaining.
B00957T6X6|5.0|Excellent characterization makes these books well worth reading. Important: they are graphically violent and sexual, and many of the characters die. It can be depressing, and occasionally difficult to follow. It is still a great series.
B00BAXFECK|4.0|Although I usually think that making a reader slog through 700 pages is the height of author self-indulgence, Donna Tartt's exquisite attention to detail and her ability to make her characters take on a life made this book a pleasure to read.  Well, maybe pleasure isn't exactly the right word - the path of her protagonist - a boy who's life is irrevocably changed by the accidental death of his mother - is at times almost unbearably painful and depressing.  But this isn't the adventures of Winnie the Pooh.  Toward the end of the book I began to skip pages as she took way too long to end it.  If what you're looking for is total submersion, a book where you can lose yourself and your other cares for a week, then I recommend it strongly.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This book is elegant, sonorous, beautiful. It has a sense of poetry underlining the prose that makes it both easy to read and makes you want to think. It contains details not in the movie based upon it, which is a good complement to it. I was very glad I read it.
B004IPPINW|5.0|An ironic lesson on how to deal with the irrational and  biased fears  of the so called &#34; first world&#34; citizens.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|I loved it, some may find it difficult to follow. It is well worth the read. The story it tells meshes well with the movie that is based upon it, filling in some missing details and adding depth to the characters. Be aware of adult situations.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|Interesting and useful information.  I do not see myself going as far as the author suggests, however, I do feel better having not eaten wheat for 2 years.
B001BANK32|5.0|One of Stephen King's earlier classics. Well worth the read. Note that the follow up novel Dr. Sleep is coming out shortly, if it is not out already, making it a good time to read this book again, or for the first time if you haven't yet.
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|Its ok. My husband  loved it. I do not like  this kind of language. But he really loved it so that is the reason I have it a four star.<br />I will never understand  boys,  men  but he saw it with friends and they just really loved it.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Thank you Mr. King for an excellent read!  Well done.  I could not put this book down...suspense and surprises throughout.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Gosh I love  this kind of movies. I have all the James Bond series so this one is as good as those.<br />Really entertaining, more realistic I would say. It is really good
B00915G6MG|5.0|How can you go wrong with NCIS?  DVD is great and have had no problems with it.  I have all seasons of NCIS and watch them a lot.  Pricing was good too.
B00GH4RKYM|4.0|Great movie way better then the original superman. I hope they come out with the next movie I could see them adding to it.
B000UVT3OI|5.0|Excellent CD.  How can you go wrong with Garth Brooks.  Pricing was good and I have had no problems with it.
B009NX1YT6|3.0|Sound and video quality were fair. I'm a fan of the movie and still hope that a GOOD quality transfer to digital will be completed.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Very good heatsink, I use it with a 3rd gen i5 overclocked and this heatsink keeps it at 31 Celsius, which is very low for my processor  . Only downside is it can block some RAM slots and only comes with 1 fan for it, and it is kind of a pain to install, I needed a second person to hold the screws.
B003477DVK|5.0|My two daughters (ages 9 and 7) and I loved this movie.  It had an easy-to-follow plot and good messages throughout.  Of course, my kids were bawling at the very end, but it taught them some valuable life lessons about pets.
B001AH6ZWY|4.0|The movie was well done, with decent acting, nice music, and a few very impressive visuals (especially for the time period). The story is engaging and it helps you stop and think a little bit about how small we are and what should matter to us.<br /><br />The main thing I didn't like about the movie was the sort of constant battle in it between supposed science and supposed religion; the movie doesn't lean one way or the other in the end (the protagonist for instance starts out very against pure faith, but ends up strongly in favor of it), but throughout it seems to be trying too hard to promote a tension between the two. There wasn't very much character conflict in the plot, I guess, so they had to create something for conflict, and it didn't go very well. The film is also longer than it needed to be, IMHO.<br /><br />Overall, a good movie, and fun trip back to the 90s. I smiled seeing Clinton and CRT monitors everywhere :)
B00846REIS|5.0|I loved this book. There were many similarites to Fifty Shades of Grey and it was definitely just as juicy but that's why I loved those series, as well.  This book did not disappoint.  The chemistry between Eva & Gideon is irresistable and I couldn't book the book down.  I love this stuff!
0316055433|2.0|I like long books, but not tedious books. This was tedious.  I'm reading Les Miserables in french and am enjoying every moment. Every moment!  I could not get into The Goldfinch: why? - over-wrought writing, padding out the drama, oh, so llooooong, my god I had to wade through the first fifty pages, just like the young boy wading through all that horrific debris.  Then on to the next chapter and again too much belabored writing.  An editor is needed to cut the book by at least one quarter.  Get rid of the chaff!  etc!  This is my first and last Donna Tartt book.
B004UNX1LS|2.0|search function is weird. They should have lesser known artists. If you like the big names, though, this is the place to find them
B004IFYMWK|4.0|It was well done. It was nice that the movie was based on a true story. It is educational without being completely biased.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love to play this game. It's very addicting. It's a lot if fun to play with attractive prizes. You ought to give it a try.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|What is there to say? The name says it all &#34;Chris Kyle&#34; A great American the finest tradition. Unfortunately a tragedy took his life while away from the battlefield. You have to read this book. If you only read one book this year. This is the one!!!
B003DS3GC0|5.0|Great story line. One of the few movies I truely enjoyed seeing this year. Some of the best acting one could ask for.
B005MYEPXC|5.0|We stayed a week in the apartment above the bistro across from the church steps where the Peugeot stopped each night.  And the music keeps taking me back.  It's in the Sorbonne (school) district and the students occupied the street until 4:00AM the first Saturday night we stayed there.  Party on Parisians!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I had heard about this book and went to the library only to find it was Reserved by a long list. I added my name anyway and several months later, I had it in my hand. Rather than my wife and I reading it independently, I read it aloud and man, what a story!  As a former Army Officer, I know something about honour and chivalry so of Franz, I can understand, to some degree, why he did what he did. This book is a must read for anyone who is interested in the back stories of WW2 and is by far the best I have ever read. Thanks Adam for bringing this to us and thanks especially to Franz and Charlie for making it possible. And Yes, we too teared up at the end!<br /><br />Ken
B000A6EXNO|5.0|I have several DSLRs and will not go out without the DK-19 on them.  this is perfect.  Just be careful because they tend to fall off very easily.  Cheers
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Fun game. It is different from most farming games. Plus you use different people. I really like the scenery. Good game for adults and children.
B0084AZXKK|4.0|A easy to read and interesting story.  The kind of read that you use to end your day and travel to another time and place in your mind.
B00BHHIWQO|2.0|I don,t understand this game. No matter what l do, my score stays the same. I think it's a fun game if it would quit asking me to buy all the time .  And why does my scores change. I have no one to ask.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I think that it was amazing. Very moving. Just the way I expected it to be. Long live Divergent. :*
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Wonder is the most greatest book that me and my family love.<br />It was exciting because auggie the boy sometimes doesn't like who he is but then he figures out that people like him for who he is.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|All of these books are fabulous! They are such an easy read and such good books! Love all of them!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Stephen King is the Sci-Fi God of today. Mixing this with extremely accurate details, times, dates, and an alternate reality most of us want to seen played out, was an amazing experience. This book is looong, but absolutely worth the read.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Didn't like at all.  Found it boring  and to much changing from one person to another. do not recommend at all.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|The worst part of it all is knowing the series is over, however, reading the lead up to those last few chapters was amazing. Insurgent will stay my favorite of the three, but you can't not read Allegiant! &#60;3
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|very enjoyable movie.. loved it more than most from the past few years.. might be a glimpse of the future, but hopefully not :-)
B00FN811SY|5.0|The best library to get educated on the  Bible u will find answers to common question, like what happens to you at death. Why is their do much suffering. What does it really mean when we pray for Gods Kingdom.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Can't stop playing I love this game and fb makes it so much better I set my alarm clock so that I can play it to beat a level
B009HXG9UQ|5.0|This film is Anderson's finest. Nothing surpasses it. Bellissimo. This film was simply amazing in every way possible. Hope you all enjoy.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Way better than the original, on Facebook. Faster and better graphics. Easier to play on the Kindle. I love it.
B00821PCJS|4.0|Very compelling! Well written with great story lines. Has drama, suspense, romance, humor, all of the ingredients for a terrific series!
B004IQMXD4|5.0|Magic
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|Interesting, but totally predictable in the story line and outsome.  Grisham in his usual lawyers are cads mode and the characters pretty much stilted and unfleshed
B00DPKQ60A|5.0|I got this cd for my daughter.  She sounds so beautiful and there is no innapropriate words or language used in the album.
B00F8KIJ2I|4.0|Avril Lavigne is back with yet another great album. This one is definitely more rock that the two prior (Best Damn Thing and Goodbye Lullaby). I cannot say it is her best (Under My Skin!!!), but it is very good.<br /><br />Track by track review:<br /><br />1. Rock N Roll-The rocking beats and the feel-good have fun lyrics, and making a statement about rock n roll as a visual and a lifestyle (really should not miss the music video either), not to mention the guitar solo which is unexpected and excellent. 11/10<br /><br />2. Here's To Never Growing Up-a pop-rock anthem that kind of sounds like Nickelback, and considering Avril is now married to Nickelback front man Chad Kroeger, it's not unexpected. She also mentions Radiohead. A party song with lyrics involving staying young and enjoying your life forever. 10/10<br /><br />3. 17-a song about reminiscing, and who doesn't do that? A lighter, acoustic but fast song that flows well and sounds beautiful. I'll say it; she does it way better than her competition, like say, Taylor Swift (not hating just think this is better). 9/10.<br /><br />4. Bitchin Summer-a fun song meant to be a summer jam song, hopefully it gets to be the fifth single (we need a fourth prior to summer), with suggestive but playful lyrics, and songs about summer are always fun. How good is it? There is actually a random mid-section with a little bit of rap. If you liked \\"Nobody's Fool\\" from the original album, or even thought it was too much, this song will definitely appeal to you. 10/10<br /><br />5. Let Me Go feat. Chad Kroeger-a powerful ballad with vocals of both Avril Lavigne and Chad Kroeger. The title speaks for what the song is about, and speaks of remembrance, love, etc. There is some serious beauty in the layered lyrics near the end as well. 11/10<br /><br />6. Give You What You Like-a slower song with a almost 60's/70's early country sound, or like early Cher almost...really random, background is a little like Lady Gaga's \\"Teeth.\\" Not great, but different. 7/10.<br /><br />7. Bad Girl-a darker song featuring some metal vocals from Marilyn Manson, but it's not a duet. The metal crowd that likes female singers should love this song. It's Avril Lavigne with a more metal edge, with Manson-who can ask for more? 10/10<br /><br />8. Hello Kitty-ok, seriously, this could've been fun, but it is just too goofy. Random yelling, not like it's a story about merch or Hello Kitty...yeah. Pretty much a 0/10.<br /><br />9. Ain't Seen Nothin Yet-Not a striking song, but keeps with the same themes as other songs, and the love-story going around \\"you ain't seen nothing yet\\" shows Avril in love (probably referring to Chad I'd think). Nice to hear the once super-angry girl finding love...hope this one is a keeper after Derek (her ex.) 8/10.<br /><br />10. Sippin' On Sunshine-two summer jams on one album? While I do not think it's as good as \\"Bitchin Summer\\" because it isn't as original and sounds more generic, it's pure fun and energetic. This one tips more off of the \\"having fun\\" of the other summer song and more on the relaxation side. So, where it could've came off as filler, it doesn't. 9/10<br /><br />11. Hello Heartache-The song with the most impressive lyrics by Avril. The strongest vocal content at the beginning and all the way through. The song titles on this album are pretty straight-forward. A very strong song asking questions. 10/10<br /><br />12. Falling Fast-Hard to really have an opinion around this song, thought the title would mean more, but it was kinda slow, not in a good way. Hard to really have much of an opinion, it's just kinda here, nothing great. 7/10<br /><br />13. Hush Hush-a calm album closer, sounds like someone else did this song honesty, this comes off like lite or alternative, hardly a bad thing. We do want our artists to try different things and grow. It has strong lyrics about not dwelling on the past, but moving on to a better, brighter future. 9/10.<br /><br />Though it has better \\"rocking\\" songs than most of her albums, I would have to vote this album below her prior \\"Goodbye Lullaby\\" effort, but above \\"The Best Damn Thing\\" I find \\"Under My Skin\\" to be her loudest, rocking album, still with meaningful lyrics, and no filler. In fact, a lot of this reflects the sound of her debut \\"Let Go,\\" when it isn't being experimental. If Avril can hold onto all her eras while still growing, she will keep having strong album sales even when being slutty seems to prevail in the industry today...<br /><br />Overall, of course I'd recommend this album. Her doing some collaborations definitely makes for something that is enjoyable.

1932907009|4.0|Some of you are probably wondering why I’m reviewing a screenwriting book. Well not only is it November which is NaNoWriMo month but this is also incredibly helpful for those out there who are writers,editors, and agents. I was recommended this by someone in the publishing industry, she felt that it was a great tool to use when looking at a story and seeing if it works as a whole and if it’s capable of selling to both publishers and customers.<br /><br />My book is full of sticky notes…like it has sticky notes on the sides and then also inside to point out even more things that will be incredibly helpful when I look at manuscripts, especially mine, with a critical eye.<br /><br />Obviously this deals with movies and screenwriting, but it is broken down in an easy to understand way that you can easily apply it to novel. It was incredibly enlightening to see how similar the two writing practices are and that a lot of the techniques could be applied with ease. I also loved seeing the movie examples which kind of made it easy to see how the techniques are applied. Of course there were things that couldn’t be translated over but I still really enjoyed learning about the movie industry and how screenwriters make a living.<br /><br />One of the neat things is this helps with the things you don’t really think about while writing, like your ‘logline’ and synopsis. It helps build it in a way that sells the story but doesn’t reveal all the little tricks.It helps you think about the core necessities like what does you character truly want, it reminds you of the importance of showing and not just telling and it gives some great ideas for how you can pre-plan your story. Of course there is a ton more packed into a this thin book.<br /><br />Overall I’m super happy I bought this one and I plan to use this for my own stories, especially this really cool chart idea for story planning. If you’re looking to polish up your story and get it ready for the world I definitely think it’s worth a look. If you’re a screenwriter then I can definitely say this is a great accessible bit of info that may help you out.nitely think it’s worth a look.

B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I've played many games of this sort on my iPhone, computer, and Fire HDX and this is by far the best. It is free and worth downloading for anyone interested in this type of game or looking for a new time-buster. Wonderful graphics and sounds add to what is already an immersive storyline and an extensive collection of adventures.
1563899426|4.0|As most of my readers know I’m a fan of fairy-tales and I love when someone gives me a new and fresh take on stories so old. Fables: Legends in Exile does just that. This collects the first five issues of the series as we as a prose story called ‘The Wolf in the Fold’.<br /><br />I have picked up this book so many times in bookstores in the past and I always put it down. I was drawn to the premise but no the art and I never really gave it a chance, until a few weeks ago when my boyfriend bought a game based on them. He bought the comics and we both devoured them in a few days. Williagham takes the stories we know so well and puts them in the middle of New York city. They are exiled from their storybook world and now they have deal with the reality and grit of living in a place that doesn’t really belong to them. Now to make matters worse there has been a murder which threatens their secret existence and starts pulling at the already tension filled nerves.<br /><br />This follows the ‘sheriff’ Bigby Wolf (get it? Big B Wolf *giggle snorts*) as he tries to sniff out just who killed Rose Red. We get to see a side of the big bad wolf that we don’t really get a chance to in the short stories from our childhood and instead of just being a jerk of a wolf, he proves to be somewhat intelligent and capable of empathy…though he’s still kind of a jerk and really gruff. We also get to see just how famous characters like Snow White, Prince Charming, Belle, and Beast are coping with the change and how their relationships are faring. Beast and Belle are my favorite fairy tale characters so it was awesome to see them again, and even though their part in the story is not a big one I still loved seeing them.<br /><br />I appreciated that this wasn’t just a straight forward fairytale retelling and that there was the added mystery element that took the forefront, because in some ways that made me pay attention to the tiny details even more. It was also a really good excuse to brush up on some fairy-tales I’m not entirely familiar with like Bluebeard. I can’t wait to see what everyone is up too in Volume 2.excuse to brush up on some fairy-tales I’m not entirely familiar with like Bluebeard. I can’t wait to see what everyone is up too in Volume 2.
B008NAFDF6|5.0|Unit came with the connecting ribbon.  It slid in with a little persuasion and locked down.  The Acer Aspire One found the drive in BIOS.  Installed Ubuntu 12.04LTS and it is still running.  It was small enough to slide under the motherboard and wedged in there. I placed it in the anti static wrapper for insulation.  Not glued in, but snug fit.

B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I love the game, but I find the barriers to episodes annoying. I really dislike the annoy your friends options, so waiting three days is the only way to proceed.

B00FHATBGW|4.0|Pretty good game but the transitions between scenes were jumpy and not smooth. But the graphics were nice and it had a interesting story. I wish these companies that do Hidden Object games would realize we are using a small screen and have everything so dark! It's suppose to be hidden not invisible! Lighten up the scenes please so we can see the game!
B00CL0J99K|5.0|Wonderful movie . All of the Iron man movies are great and this is one of the best . Robert Downey is great

I am Absolutely Furious because I did not even receive a notice of the sellers cancellation.

B00F52YOPA|5.0|Hidden Object Home Make over is a fun game. It did lock up on me once on level 54. Keeps you entertained!
B0052RDHTM|3.0|The story is well told, but to me the &#34;romance&#34; gets in the way of the history.  Three stars from me.
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|As with some of the other Kindle users, my first cable completely fell apart (after a few years).  It started peeling, exposing the wires within the protective layer.  Once it started peeling, the whole thing cracked and totally peeled apart.  I did have to pay shipping for this new one but I didn't have to pay for the cable itself.  I hope this one is made better.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Beautiful, emotional story! It wraps you up in it. Highly recommend it to both young and old. Can't wait for the movie.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|This was such a touching and well-written book.  So many people I know and have known have gone through this it can be very heartbreaking.
B00CEZJT2E|4.0|Charger is excellent. Charged all three iPhones before it ran out of juice. Just wish it could be charged and charge phone at the same time.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I read this book and found it to be quite intriguing.  The characters were well devised and not disgusting like they could have been.  I didn't like the ending too much so I was quite sure I didn't want to read the others.  I did, however, and was glad for that.
B002VPE1WK|2.0|Cheap get around bag, not so comfortable and doesn't hold tripod on the side well at all. Everyone has the own preferences with camera bags and it really depends on you lifestyle. For me I upgraded to something thats 50% camera bag and 50% hiking back pack with enough straps for two skis and a tripod.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|Interesting movie about addiction.  There seems to be an onslaught of movies lately about addiction and the following redemption usually after a major tragedy.  This is but another of those stories.  Addiction is not a pretty thing and this movie drives that point home.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|Loved it! I can't believe I waited so long to read it. Definitely a must read for all who love literature.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I got dragged into playing.  Its both annoying and addicting.  Dont love the graphics but a good way to pass the time away.
B004DMIIOG|5.0|I love it! Beautiful Animation a MUST Have for the fans or not. Obrigatory!! Thanks Amazon! Until next time o/
B00GOQ9M4O|5.0|Great episode- Relax all you haters.<br />The Governor is certainly worthy of an episode and this was a touching full episode story of what he has been doing. I am curious to see if he reverts back to his old ways or not.
B007SGM084|5.0|I LOVE THE SERIES. IT'S A EXCELLENTLY WRITTEN. I CAN<br />NOT STOP READING it. I have read it three times since I got it. I love the books can not wait till her next book is out. It's hard to put down. Interesting,intriguing and exciting at the same time. MUST READ!!!!!!!!!
B005GYGCOI|3.0|I've found the book's content useful, but finding the information I needed was not easy with the e-book version. I recommend buying the hard-cover version, or looking for a more digital-friendly book.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Does an amazing job of cleaning my Android phone and freeing up space----and so quickly---it is unbelievably fast---and, as far as I can tell (not being a tekkie), complete and accurate (no problems after using this----which is often the problem with these &#34;cleaning&#34; apps)!  Great product----highly recommended
B003F3PMYI|5.0|An excellent book; well written with concrete steps to take to improve your life.<br /><br />What do you have to lose?
B00FB029IU|5.0|VERY HOT NEW TALENT, LOVE HIS ORIGINAL THOUGHT OUT LYRICS AND WAY COOL VOCALS!!  JAKE IS VERY &#34;DYLANESQUE&#34; AND THAT'S THE ULTIMATE COMPLIMENT!  KEEP PUMPING OUT THE CD'S.  YOUR SECOND IS AS GREAT AS YOUR FIRST IF NOT EVEN BETTER!!
B00B7Y0206|1.0|I wasn't able to access my existing playlists even after signing in.  Seems like they want you to download the lists. not really worth the effort.
B003O86FMW|5.0|There is s reason why these books are so popular. They leave you devastated and yet hopeful at the same time. I only wish there were more than three.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I loved the book, but the movie underwhelmed me in some ways. Certain moments that I thought were really powerful got edited out. Maybe they will show up in the second movie, but I doubt it. I also thought the costuming for the Capital folk was not as well done as it could have been. The acting was solid though, and I cannot WAIT to see the second one with the great additions they've made - Phillip Seymour Hoffman specifically.
0762777931|5.0|This is truly one of the best books I've ever read. Kris Carr, the author of this book is one of the most inspiring people i've ever followed. Her story is absolutely fantastic. In this book, she tells her story & how she chose to take control of her life by changing the way the lives and eats. She lays out an easy way to convert to this very healthy lifestyle and diet. Its easy, you just have to commit to something drastically different.<br /><br />Again, I recommend this book to anyone who is sick and tired of being sick and tired. Kris Carr will tell you how to feel better!
B00000634J|5.0|Great sounds from a lost era and generation. A must for anyone who grew up during that time, or wish they had.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This is one of my favorite books! It had an amazing story line. I loved everything about this book. I could read it over and over again!
1451626657|2.0|I know many think this is the greatest American novel ever written (including Heller himself), but I could not get through more than half of it. Heller has amazing ability to play with language, mostly double and triple negatives, but I found the story eventually got quite boring. Anyway, life is too short to read a book you don't like, so I dropped it halfway through.
1465414444|5.0|A well designed, illustrated and written recap of World of Warcraft lore. Although its size qualifies it as a coffee table book, it is an excellent reference book for any part of the WoW timeline.
B00DMK6WN4|5.0|For a sequel, this was just as good as the first movie!  We as parents enjoyed the humor!  Great family movie!
B00G9U7R2O|5.0|Great Movie My Family And I Enjoyed It Very Much.<br />If You Rent it You Will Get Your Money's Worth
B00AS1Q93S|4.0|TC does a good job, and the movie has a real story besides all the shoot 'em ups out ..........enjoyed it
B00G32TD98|2.0|Very predictable horror story with the obligatory happy ending. This is not as nearly as good as the Saw franchise.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app never glitches,  and is super easy to use! I Love being able to pin anything on the go.
B00GH4R95C|2.0|I've seen all of the Superman genre movies, and by and large they are all inferior to the Batman franchise. This new addition is also a disappointment. I don't think the lead actor has any charisma, which is a killer. Very predictable plot and ending.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|My husband got this as way to stream movies from his PC in his mancave to our TV's in the family room and our bedroom.  It provides beautiful High Def pictures and movies.<br />  As to the technical difficulty in getting this set up for all of uses (internet streaming, DVD-sourced movies, going to multiple sources, etc), he's still working it to make it do everything he wants.  I've asked if there's good documentation that he can use, but am not getting much response.  He's a typical guy who'd rather figure it out for himself rather than ask the instruction guide for directions.  So I cannot give a fair response about implementation.<br />  Am basing the 5 stars on what I see on the screen and it's performing flawlessly so far.
078513915X|4.0|Wonderful images, romantic rendering of the novel, It appears nice and charming and is suitable for teenagers who don't like reading.<br />A good idea for teaching English literature.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Great movie, got to love Bond! Something different from the past Bond flicks. Shame the Austin Martin was destroyed in the end.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is totally addictive.  I am so excited that I can finally play it on my Kindle!  It's so much easier than playing on my iphone.
B00E9PMMX0|1.0|It's pretty stupid of George Lucas to modify the classics in order to accommodate holes in the plot to the lousy prequel trilogy.  He should at least make the original theatrical versions available as a special feature.  I'm holding on to my theatrical version VHS tapes and my theatrical version DVDs (that I paid MORE for than blu-ray!) until Disney does the right thing and releases the films the right way.  It's only a matter of time.  My guess is that Disney is going to create Star Wars 7, 8, and 9, and then release a blu-ray (or whatever is the best newest format by the time this happens) box set containing all 9 episodes, and within that release contain the original theatrical versions of the original trilogy.  Until that happens I'm boycotting this offensive slap-in-the-face attempt at a quick cash-grab from the fans.  GIVE US WHAT WE WANT, is THAT SO HARD?  WE HAVE MONEY WAITING FOR YOU TO TAKE FROM US but ONLY when you DO THE RIGHT THING!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Well, I saw the movie &#34;Death Takes a Holiday&#34; made many years ago;  I watched &#34;Meet Joe Black&#34; and really liked it.  This book from the perspective of &#34;death&#34; is so tender and sad yet really quite beautiful.  It was difficult reading the ending in the waiting room of the dental office where I was waiting for my sister and had tears profusely rolling down my cheeks.  A very sweet and endearing story.  I commend the imagination to present this old theme of Nazi Germany in such a fresh narrative.
B00GHJ6BJW|3.0|I understand the direction she was going in, put out something fun and fast and bright and shiny. Unfortunately, there is not enough variation in the tracks-they all sound pretty similar. This comes off as pretentious and overproduced I'm afraid, though I am not sure that is what GaGa intended. Artpop, Donatella, and Gypsy are about all I could hang on to....Personally, I am now waiting for her to stop the madness and put out a stripped down product....just her, her voice, and a piano. This would take her to a new level (I always said she is basically a female Elton John) and she has plenty enough money not to have to worry about whether it sells or not. Time for her to reinvent herself by revealing her raw, untouched talent. Maybe next time...
B00AFROVQC|4.0|Once you start reading you won't be able to put this book down. Lots of action every chapter. Read it.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|This is an excellent television series and I love that the package came on time and in great condition. I recommend this to anyone.
B004T4KQJS|3.0|Interesting discussion on the state of physics in regard to an explanation of the material beginnings. However, the author should stay away from letting his anti-religious bias slip into his discussions. He is an obvious follower of the materialistic faith. This is shown by the author cherry picking and simplifying certain theistic worldviews and then ridiculing them. Also, making statements saying that there is no meaning that can be gleaned by the physical world around us. How can one believe that without a large degree of faith? It's interesting that he ends the book with a section that seems to try to convince the reader (poorly, I might add) that even though the universe started from \\"nothing\\" and will end in endless, consciousless expansion, there is still meaning for our existence. To me, the very fact that the author felt a need to go there shows he acknowledges the internal need of all humans to be and feel significant and the utter failure of a materialistic worldview and the discipline of physics to provide that significance and meaning.<br /><br />The book wants to answer the question why there is something rather than nothing, and to do so in such a way as to slam the door shut on centuries of \\"primitive religious superstition,\\" as Dawkins suggests in the afterwards. But, for the reader to actually accept the answers given in the book, they must manifest large amounts of faith and trust in a class of scientist, as opposed to a holy book or class of priests of the religious. The very type of faith the book ridicules others for.<br /><br />I am both a graduate school (PhD) trained engineer and a believer in the authority of the Christian Bible. Even if I accepted all of the physics of this book, it would not change my religious beliefs at all. The rationality of my faith is simply not based upon the things that the discipline of physics would touch. I don't start with the restriction of a materialistic worldview that the author obvious has.<br /><br />Bottom line, it's an interesting book when it focuses on the discipline of physics (which is a great majority of the book). The author would have done well to leave out his pot-shots at all things \\"religious\\" especially when his own faith-based presuppositions are not stated upfront. The only ones he convinces are those that already worship at the alter of materialism.
1857885082|5.0|Hillarious book. Reminded me so much of home, it brought back memories and family and friends, I could relate to a lot of what was written.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very clever. Addictive and good fun. Feels impossible at times but just takes a bit of patience. need more levels!
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|The convenience of having the complete season close at hands helps in discussions about the show. The entire season can be seen over a weekend without commercial interruption. When the kids come home from college they can catch up on any episodes that were missed.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Everyone should get this app...it is the most helpfull application you will ever install. It basically takes your R.AM. and makes it clear allowing your kindle to work faster !

B00G4CXHSK|5.0|This game is super cool and I would recommend it for people who like platforms games and pixel games. If your like me you will get this game because it is awesome and free!
B0094K1PW4|5.0|Great movie. The alien and his ability to know who was out to hurt him and who wasn't. Also typical gov't cover-up, not letting the public know the truth. One day the people will know about what the gov't is hiding. May all the creatures of the universe live in peace!!!
B00ESB6GBY|5.0|I love this show! I love everything about it. It is the best show I have ever seen in my entire 31 years. To me, it is more than just a show. You really care about these characters and you want so badly to be part of their group, to be their friend. You feel their pain when they are sad, cry when they cry, and you want to hold them and comfort them when they are going through a tough time. You laugh when they laugh and are happy when they are happy. I am going through a really depressing time in my life right now and this show is the rock that is holding me together and helping me survive. I love it!
B00EHMG358|5.0|Another AWESOME Pendergast tale from Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child.  I really love it that we are now seeing Pendergast with feelings.  Keep it up, please!
B006JD48NM|5.0|I have been an auto racing fan my whole life, and worked in Indy Car racing for 15 years, and I found this to me the greatest racing movie I have ever seen.  If you don't find it touching, you have a heart of stone.  Senna was truly a larger-than-life hero.  For any racing fan, this is a must-own item.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loving this series and reading the transformation of both the main characters! Sad to see the series end! Can't wait for the movies!!!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book brings a light to what it is like for a warrior and his family. Both Chris and Taya tell their sides in detail. Remarkable book. God bless. Thank you Chris and Taya both.
B001HM1PFO|5.0|It will get you eventually.... No other flick in the world quite like it. That's why it's considered a cult film.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|As always, Denzel shows up to perform. Great acting on his part and John Goodman's appearances in comedic relief were well timed.  Good plot, not the best, but was entertaining
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Great biography of a very complicated individual.  Revolutionary , visionary, inspirational, but also deeply flawed human being.  Highly recommended bio.  I bought the Kindle version and really enjoyed reading it on a smart phone.  The perfect format for reading about someone so personally responsible for this brave new world we live in.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|A book to make you think...the law, the rights, family and forgiveness ...wonderfully presented. It will turn over in my head for a long while.
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|So funny!!!!  The animals were especially funny.  Totally unpredictable!  We actually watched it twice.  I would recommend it to all.
B008CRC506|5.0|Love this show and glad it was available on dvd so quickly. Great music and fabulous cast.... great interaction! Will miss it on tv.
B002DOSBMK|5.0|This is my first book in the series. I chose to start with this one as opposed to book IV which would have been the original order. I'm glad I did. I learned much of the drow way of life. Drizzt is a great character and I look forward to his adventure that is just beginning.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|So far it's not bad. Still a lot of possible micro transactions which I don't like but I'll do w h at I can without spending money.
B00ECU4DPW|5.0|Grandchildren enjoyed this movie. The little girls are just fascinated with it. Teaches lessons for little ones. Again thank you.
B00E3IZIM0|4.0|Good movie full of giant robots beating up monsters!<br /><br />Great value, with the 3D Btu-ray, normal blu-ray and DVD all bundled together.
B004GJXQ20|5.0|It can be a bit overwhelming in the beginning, but stick with it. Recommended even if you've watched the series. Brilliant.
006123205X|5.0|Great Product, it should be given to all at the court house or church as they get married. Right on spot.
0316322407|5.0|The book came to me quickly and it was in great condition.  I liked being able to get some of the costs defrayed for previous purchases.<br /><br />The book was great.  Malala is an amazing young woman.  She demonstrates her wisdom and commitment to learning for herself and all girls.  Yet you also see flashes of the little girl.  I also got to learn a bit more about the issues in the Middle East.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|The game crashed a couple of times, but it was so good I didn't care. I can't wait for the next installment.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I believe this is really great game first time ive played deer hunter ever but I really like it so ill probably get it for a different platform also thanks highly recommend
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|I found that there was a lot of legalese which made it a little tedious reading for me!  I could also put it down and not want to keep reading to see what was going to happen!  A good book though!
B0084TWN9K|3.0|The book is rather glum. Some of the stories were beyond me, I admit, even though I read a lot ....
B006OAB3ME|5.0|Liked the old songs with new arraingements. Great musicians playing background. bought it after I saw the Pbs special on it
B00CNQ7CRI|3.0|The book made me smile, but not more than that. It is more of the same. It did not make me think.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This is a great product. I have been in the photography business for 7 years now and recently had my camera bag with my camera in it stolen. It was a very nice Lowpro bag...hmmm I wonder whats in that bag? This bag is perfect and cheap! Wonder if it is water proof, well I wouldn't throw it in a river, but I have hiked through a few rainstorms with it and the only thing that got wet was me and the outside of the bag. The tripod straps are not durable enough for my tripod, but it is great to hold my monopod on it. The thing I love the most about it besides being so cheap is that it has so many pockets! I forget where I put my things because there are so many pockets! I just recently bought my son a DSLR and will be getting him this bag as well. Great BUY!!
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Aside from the popularity of the movies, this series is just excellent. Stephenie Meyer's storytelling ability is on par with the level of authors like Stephen King!
B003Y5H4SY|4.0|makes the hair stand on my neck in the 1 scene. Give it time to set up.  Saw it on HBO first...
B000FA675C|4.0|Fun read. Very thought-provoking. Much better than the book! I enjoyed it though I enjoyed Angels and Demons a bit more.
B00ANGICRE|5.0|Helen Hunt is great as usual. Surprised and pleased she did this movie. She will pull me to any movie she is in.
B00FAPU0UK|5.0|Two skilled authors have teamed up and created an enticing story that is both hot and killer-ice-cold. Bedroom Games: 1 (Seven Levels) by Regina Puckett and Charity Parkerson  is a book you won’t be able to put down until you finish and that comes all too quickly. Sex, passion, anger, fear, a killer on the loose – hold on! Can’t wait for more from this pair of master storytellers. 5 –stars!
0440237688|5.0|Good story! Price worth it and Fast shipping.<br />The book is brand news. Well organize, simple, short, and very interesting novel.
B00AFROVQC|2.0|Well, I'm gay and I'm offended by the gay villain in this story. I think maybe it's a combination of the lack of character development and the use of stereotypical gay behaviors as a device to portray him in a negative light. Basically, it appears that the author meant him to be a mean, swishy, gay guy. So, I'm kinda offended by this. You might be too, if you're LGTB.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|If you like racing games download this game!!!!!<br /><br />If you don't like driving games definitely download this game!!!!!!!<br /><br />If you don't have a Kindle, go out and get a Kindle Fire HD and absolutely download Asphalt 8: Airborne !!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00EKJWS1Q|5.0|I have outlook on the computer, having the outlook light on the phones makes it easier for me to check out my mailbox.  Yea for the light app!
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|This game is ! ok fun I like the graphics and the cars. When my brother downloaded this I thought it was going to be boring but then when I did the first race it was fun. Like the game
0385366477|5.0|Listening to the story while on a long road trip was even better than reading it. The actor was fantastic at the different character voices and I felt like I was listening to a movie.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Before I played this game I never understood why people were so obsessed with games. After four hours of non stop playing I think I understand.
B00CNQ7CRI|5.0|Just as good as the other Bridget Jones books! Reading about 51-year-old Bridget didn't turn out to be as depressing as it sounded at first. The episode with her toyboy is superbly written; humourous and moving at the same time. Also the schoolmaster character was really entertaining.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|Great time consumer can not get enough of this game absolutely love it spent all my work hours on it
B00499NHLC|5.0|Intelligent treatment of a classic.  High production values.  Clever dialogue.  Very inventive way to convey Sherlock's thought processes.  Interesting locations.  Fresh .  Top class all the way.  Each episode better than the previous one.
B00GH4RKYM|4.0|Man of steel is a wonderful action film that gives the audience a modern look at the powers of superman. Unfortunately, the movie lacks inspiration and depth. While a  wonderful action film the movie was full of plot holes and lacked an underlying message. I would definitely recommend this movie to fans of Superman who want to see him represented with modern SFX technologies.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I enjoy playing the Bingo Blitz games and find them to be fast-paced and fun. There's enough variety between the Bingo and slots to keep things interesting. The free daily bingo tournament is great when I need a bingo fix but don't have a lot of credits and/or power plays!<br /><br />The one aspect of the game I find frustrating is the site response when my WiFi connection lags and the connection is not lost....There's no auto daub available in these instances and playing catch up can be frustrating.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|I totally loved this.  Historical fiction at its best and including some real-world characters (e.g., Darwin).  One of the best historical fiction books I have read.
B001BANK32|5.0|Classic novel. Read it years ago (as a teen) and it gave me nightmares. Read it again recently just to refresh my memory and to get ready to read his follow-up book, Doctor Sleep.  The Shining is one of his greatest books... no nightmares this time, but definitely stayed on my mind for weeks.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Easy to use. Whole family loves it. It's so cool to get a teaching video from YouTube and project it onto my big screen TV. Very happy.Worth the money.
B003CH9PTU|5.0|You have to be able to see the hilarity in bad situations and this TV series is full of them.<br />If the cover doesn't pique your curiosity as to what went on in the first season, I don't know what would.
B00G9U7R2O|5.0|As good as the first one... a wonderful, funny, entertaining prequel.  Mike and Sully continue to have great adventures together.
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|This is another no brainer. I believe in this game so much that I simply give my niece my phone to download the games because I see how much she enjoys them. The great thing is I can actually see the results of her playing them continually. Really great stuff!
B007L5LD9O|4.0|Not a big fan of turn of the century romantic comedies, but must admit, I kind of liked this movie.  The performances are all strong, the story is cute and uplifting (kind of a welcome reprieve from the dark and dire stuff I normally watch), very similar to Much Ado About Nothing - a he said, she said series of miscues and mishaps around love and relationships that ultimately has a happy ending - nothing terribly deep, but, nevertheless, a pleasant diversion when you need some time to just unwind, relax and enjoy a movie.
B007FDE4Y8|2.0|I'm conflicted on whether to give it a 2 or a 3.....I'm going to keep typing and I'll know when I am finished. Let's see for my first gig with it the bolts became unloose and I couldn't use it which led to me sending it back. Yeah, let me changed it to two stars. It is slightly difficult to balance, but after watching a couple of youtube videos on it I figured it out. I would go with the S-40 if you are looking for a cheap stabilizer.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|I preordered this for my husband after seeing it in the theatre. Love this movie, movie the whole family can watch together.
B00EVW0SA0|5.0|great movie one that was better then i thought it would be. so glad that i rented it. thank you
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I absolutely love this app. I got it today and I'm already hooked. I highly recommend this game for anybody.
031623480X|5.0|WOW!!! The information in this book is astounding!  I was blown away.  The author is well qualified to write on this subject and does so with style, humor and flair while presenting some hard facts.  I thought this book was tremendous and bought copies for others!  A must read!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I am addicted to this.  Very enjoyable Better than playing with a deck of cards.  Well done and quick. to use
B009A9BEHU|5.0|I love Coldplay. When I listen to this cd it takes me back to the concert. I love their live cds as much as the others.  Great band, great people.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I like the idea of Mark Greaney co-authoring the Clancy books. After reading Greaney's Gray Man series he has quickly become one of my favorite authors. It took a while for the story in this book to get interesting to where it would hold my attention. But when it finally did, it didn't let up. Now that Clancy has passed I hope that the Clancy estate keeps his legacy alive by writing more books with Greaney such as this one.
B009G8GRX6|5.0|At first I didn't know what to think of it, but it really grew on me and now it's been in my cd player in the car for MONTHS.  Muse is quickly becoming one of my favorite bands. Love the talent and heart of this band.
0446519456|5.0|This book is on communicating with the dead in the afterlife. The author seems to be in command of his subject matter and this is a good book.  I love the subject matter
B006LSZECO|3.0|Language was terrible. Justice did not overcome evil in the end. I would never recommend this book to anyone. It is suspenseful,but ending is a dud!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Great game and you can't beat the price. I love Mahjong.....and was looking for one to play on my android tablet.
B00CNQ7CRI|2.0|I had forgotten how much I disliked that format for writing.  Boring to the point that I couldn't be bothered to finish it.
B004UJAOLM|4.0|I don't know what I thought I knew about this classic, but it was definitely different from my vague preconceived notions. The characters were tortured. The setting vivid. I enjoyed it very much, although I am not sure what to make of it.<br /><br />I am happy to say that I can cross this off my list.
B004J4WLPU|5.0|This was one of the best books I read all year. I could put it down. Would recommend it to anyone. I also loved her other book Afterwards
B001F0WXY0|5.0|Simply the best science fiction I've ever read. It contains all of my favorite subjects and is told and written like poetry.
1455525839|4.0|PRESTON & CHILD ARE BACK!  WHILE NOT THE BEST OF THE PENDERGAST SERIES ( SEE &#34;CABINET OF CURIOSITIES&#34;, &#34;STILL LIFE WITH CROWS&#34; OR &#34;BRIMSTONE&#34;) IT DEFINITELY HARKENS BACK TO THE STORY STYLE AND CALIBER OF WRITING OF THOSE EARLIER WORKS.  AFTER &#34;JUMPING THE SHARK&#34; WITH THEIR &#34;HELEN TRILOGY&#34; (NAZIS.....REALLY?),  I HAD FEARED THAT THE ONGOING STORY OF PENDERGAST WAS DONE.  HOPEFULLY THE PENDERGAST WE HAVE ALL COME TO KNOW AND LOVE IS BACK FOR GOOD.  I NOW LOOK FORWARD WITH RELISH TO THE NEXT INSTALLMENT (WHICH I CERTAINLY COULD NOT SAY AFTER THE ABYSMAL &#34;TWO GRAVES&#34;).  A WORD OF ADVICE TO THE AUTHORS,  THE LESS DETAILS WE KNOW ABOUT PENDERGASTS PAST, THE BETTER.  THE &#34;TEASERS&#34; ABOUT HIS LIFE AND FAMILY FOUND IN THE EARLIER BOOKS ARE WHAT MAKE HIM SO FASCINATING AND MYSTERIOUS.  THE  DISAPPOINTMENT OF THE &#34;HELEN TRILOGY&#34; REALLY PROVES THAT &#34;LESS IS MORE&#34;.  I WAS MUCH HAPPIER WHEN ALL I KNEW WAS THAT PENDERGAST HAD ONCE BEEN MARRIED AND THAT HIS WIFE HAD DIED TRAGICALLY.  IT WAS MUCH MORE  INTERESTING TO SPECULATE WHAT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED.  NOW THAT I KNOW THE FULL STORY, THE MAGIC IS GONE. JUST SAYING.
B0063M22QO|5.0|This is a great game. I like that you can select how hard you play on  each level. I would recommend Mahjong to my family and friends.
B00E9PMMPI|5.0|Even though this movie is from the sixties for that time and era this was ground breaking special effects. Also seeing Rachel in blu-ray is worth the added bonus. The acting is very good and the transfer to blu-ray was well done.
B00FWLDHSY|2.0|Good action scenes, very mid century Japanese action movie. Charlie Hunman just talked entirely too much and Idris never took his shirt off...
B00BPJ5Z96|5.0|Excellent movie. This has always been my favorite Bruce Lee movie. Even better in Blu-ray. Now you can slow down the action and see just how amazing Bruce's speed was in real time. If you look closely you will actually see Bruce grab Bob Wall's wrist and pull him into the backhanded fist blow to the face. In real time you would not catch this move. Now we see why he was to fast for regular tv during the Green Hornet episodes. The greatest martial artist ever. Forget all the wires and the dumb CG crap now a days in most martial arts movies.
B00AFROVQC|2.0|I was not very impressed with this book. The story is interesting enough, but the writing is juvenile and the e-book had TONS of typos in it. The idea and world were interesting, but it's all just so simplistic and the writing just kind of throws it out in front of you. It's free for a reason.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|Quite simply one of the best sitcoms in the history of television.  This is a &#34;must have&#34; for anyone who loves to laugh and enjoys the special mix of intellectual humor and social humor.  It is brilliantly written and acted and is a treat for comedy lovers of all ages.  Season six of &#34;The Big Bang Theory&#34; will have you laughing until your ribs ache.  Another great deal from the folks at Amazon.
0385537131|4.0|This is the John Grisham I know and love. This book frequently refers to his first book, A Time to Kill, and while it is not really a sequel, it takes place in the same town with some of the same players. This book kept my attention from beginning to end. I very much enjoyed the storyline and the way Grisham developed his characters.
0060775858|5.0|This classic was a favorite of both my daughters, now thirty-somethings. I decided to see if it was still around to give my new grandson, found it on Amazon, and was thrilled that is was identical the the version we had had. It brought tears to my daughter's eyes.
B00GH4RKYM|3.0|Enjoyable movie but a little too much sci-fi.  Given that Superman comes from outer space, that may seem like a strange comment, but much of the movie played like Star Trek, not Superman.  There was very little interaction between Clark and Lois, or Clark and anyone for that matter.  The movie never really got around to good character development.  All of Superman's time was spent fighting Zod and his cronies.  We never see Superman catch any bad guys or save helpless strangers.  Overall it was just OK.  Henry Cavill is an excellent Superman.  Hopefully the sequels will give us more all the way around.
B008VO3PA4|5.0|Anyone with cats will love this adorable and funny book. I couldn't put it down.  A great gift for a cat lover!
068987751X|5.0|I love it, as does my toddler. Its so much fun for her to open things to see whats hidden in behind and to see things pop out, so its a lot of fun. Highly recommend it.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I downloaded the kindle version and it cleaned up a lot of space and memory for me. I think it is a great app.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Loved it! I could not put it down, I could connect with the characters and feel their happiness and pain.
4893580914|5.0|I used this text for my teaching Japanese. I have been using this text with different version for almost 25 years. I still think that this is the best text to study Kanji. There are plenty of Kanji study books in the bookstore or online bookstore. If your teacher doesn't pick up any specific Kanji text or reference book, do please use this text. I taught for 30 years in several different countries. I still think that no other text can win over this text. This text has Volume 2, Volume 3 and more, and more. I hope you will enjoy studying learning Kanji with this text.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Every phase of the game is fantastic . Even getting other people involved to help you get extra lives, to get to next level. Very well thought out.getting new skills as you advance.
B004S5D3B6|4.0|It's hard to believe this is based on a true story. It was very captivating with great acting. Walhberg and Bale are great together.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|My daughter loves this movie! The graphics / picture and music quality is amazing.  She watches it almost every day.
B00004XQ83|4.0|I gave this to a friend as a gift, so I can't really give a review of it - but my friend was delighted, as he loved the movie! - that's OK by me!
B0031RS58I|5.0|A great feel good story - was totally engrossed and could not put it down<br />An easy read<br />Perfect for the Summer Holidays
B00BH0VSM6|4.0|The act of asking his lover to act as bait for the killer seems incompatible with his mental state. Predictable outcome.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Google makes it so its perfect!!!<br /><br />Ok fan boy jokes aside this is a great product.<br /><br />Pros:<br />SUPER easy setup.<br />Super easy use.<br />Chrome browser streaming allows you to stream other video sources that do not have a Chromecast app. (plex server, other movie sources)<br />Super cheap<br /><br />Cons:<br />Gets VERY hot when plugged in. It really bothers me with how hot this thing gets. Heat is the big killer of electronics and with as much extended use as this device is going to get I really worry that it is going to burn out.<br /><br />Lack of apps/lack of development kit at launch. I understand that Google is working with other sources on apps but there really needs to be a public development kit available so that other programs can get chromecast support. (VLC, winamp, PLEX, even itunes maybe)
B00785P2QC|4.0|Good way to pass time. But they sure make you rely on cash purchases to further your game play swiftly.
B00DSOG0QS|5.0|A gripping, fast paced mystery thriller that really grabs your attention. Great characters and surprising twists makes Staged fright a difficult book to put down.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|One of the best albums I have ever heard.  I love the variance in song styles and how this album brings those style together to tell a story.  I have been told that there are deeper meanings or inside jokes for those people who have actually gone through the 12 step process, but I can not speak specifically about what those might be.
B00499NHLC|4.0|language made it a little difficult to follow.  Overall a very good series, I am trying to pace myself and not finish the second season to quickly so I'll be up for the debut of the third season debut.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This book is a wonderful read and stays with you after you have read it.  It brings up many questions about choices and random acts that effect life.  Would be a great book for a discussion group.  Have recommended it with others.
B001GMQALY|5.0|Pretty good movie.  Being 65 years old, I should have seen this years ago, but I had never seen it.  Wow I couldn't believe how good looking both actors were. Very sexy and very much worth the rental.
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|This is great animation done with excellent humor created for all ages.  Even my 39yo who scoffs at my enjoying animated movies, giggled while tolerating my playing this one!  After it finished, I asked him his opinion and he was still smiling, replied &#34;that was funny&#34; - I don't think you can get much better praise than that from a gloom n doom type person.  As for me?  I adored it!  KUDOS to the creators!!
B00DJ4PIBK|5.0|Bought this for my daughter for her birthday!! She is so excited and can't wait to start building. Thank you!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It is very fun. It is great for kids and adults. It doesn't have any glitches. I like how you can connect to facebook and ask for lives. I highly recommend this game/app.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I loved this game on FB but couldn't play it. I'm happy to see it available for Kindle fire. Thank you Zynga.
B009VMN3RA|2.0|First comes the disclaimer. I am a fan of Shirley MacLaine. Having said that she never stroke me as someone who would get the mother of the year award. I always felt that Shirley was probably fun to be with, difficult to live with (or without in Sachi's case).<br /><br />Anyway back to Sachi Parker's book.<br />I didn't like it at all. In fact I hated it. And the reason is not because I am a fan of her mother, it's because it is badly written, poorly edited and has very little substance.<br />I have no doubt that Sachi Parker had a difficult, lonely childhood. On the other hand the stories she describes are so far fetched that makes the reader (me) question her memories. There are a few of them, especially a couple with her dad that are obviously embellished with a child's imagination (for example the story when her dad took her at age 6 to a gay Japanese club and the waiters were stark naked serving drinks while stirring them with their youknowwhats. Come on now. Give me a break.)<br /><br />I have the impression that most of her stories are true to a certain level and at some point she exaggerated them in such a manner that they seem like a collection of short drama film scripts. There is the school story, the spring break story, the australia story, the plastic surgeon story (who deals drugs btw) etc.<br /><br />What made me wonder about her imagination and sanity is how many times she let things turn bad in her life because she did nothing about it. As an adult, not as a child. There are moments that I was screaming in my head over the absurdity of some events. Losing her inheritance from her dad is one example.<br /><br />She also writes repeatedly about people that she wants to do right about them, that they were good in general until they drank and abused etc and then she describes the life from hell living with them. At which point these people were good, I wonder? There is very little evidence of that if any. Why would you want to do right by them? Because they didn't kill you?<br /><br />Anyway, I know many people liked it and are enraged about what happened to her. I am just left with questions and no real answers, just a child's exaggerations in my opinion.they didn't kill you?<br /><br />Anyway, I know many people liked it and are enraged about what happened to her. I am just left with questions and no real answers, just a child's exaggerations in my opinion.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|too time consuming, too public. It changes too often, making it require constant use to keep up with it. I am never certain if what I post is private to the ones who I want to read it.
B00CU8OVIM|5.0|J. Cole does it again. This is a great CD and a fresh breathe of fresh air as far as Hip Hop/Rap goes. J. Cole reassured me that there is still hope in this genre. Its a great listen.
0061673730|1.0|A lot of people first read this book back in collage in the 1970s. This book is the ultimate in navel gazing nonsense written by a schizophrenic. I guess people back in the 70s were so high, that's the only way i can see this piece of Pseudo philosophy doing very well. There's also something about motorcycles and some kid riding with his dad on some sort of journey of enlightenment or something of that nature, but who can tell from this incoherent mess of a book.<br /><br />Another example of drug induced nonsense disguised as something meaningful and deep, when it's just shallow nonsensical ranting and ravings of a paranoid Schizophrenic.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This game is a little glitchy but it makes up for it by giving you 110 coins. This game is still very fun. Now I can buy a game that I wanted, Dentist Story, which is like this game, kind of glitchy.
B0013FSL3E|1.0|Ugh, this movie is terrible. First of all it's way too slow in the first half, would have made a better short, then the two robots, Wall-E (Who looks like a Gamecube with wheels) and Eve (WOW That's deep.) go aboard a large ship filled with all fat an lazy. Gee Earth is polluted and everybody's fat! How heavy handed can you get. Why was this so highly praised? This movie is pretentious and dull. This would have work as a short, not a full length movie!<br /><br />I thought the music was somewhat interesting, other then that not to much to talk about. Bolt was much better then this, i absolutly LOVE Bolt! Now that should have won for best animated picture, not this overrated mess of a film. Seriously this is Pixar we are talking about.<br /><br />This movie is the perfect example of hype can push a movie.
B005H9B2CE|5.0|Watched this at the movie theater when it came out. Ordered it on Amazon Prime video to watch before we went to see the second Thor movie. It was incredible. We just loved it!
B000002JNJ|4.0|Pantera start life as a hair/glam band before reinventing them self's with their first major label album, actually there fourth album in total. Pantera's sound was dubbed by a lot of people 'Groove Metal', i would called there music southern fried thrash metal. Take Southern Rock and combine it with some thrash and you have this album. Phil's vocals still have a little bit of higher pitched for of vocals that were popular at the time, he's voice would get more intense on the second album.<br /><br />Over all this is a very strong album, great playing, pretty good lyrics, plus there's that big Texas sound. Dimebag's Darrel's (He was still called 'Diamond Darrel at this put) guitar work on this is insane. If you like Southern groove thrash pick this album up.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|An extremely fun game, a great way to kill some time if you are bored. I highly recommend it to everyone!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|really love this app was using it on my phone til i got my kindle fire, this is perfect for all of the reading i love to do
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|Great easy to use camera. The photo really look good, has a fast shutter speed. I can take several shots in a row.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I enjoy playing different types of solitaire either with a deck of cards or on my computer or kindle.  Love a good challenge.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I play this every night. It's very addictive, this is my favorite app so far. I highly recommend this one. love it A+++
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|Motivational, encouraging, insightful and just what I needed to read to help me through this patch in my life. Thanks
B007KOYEOC|3.0|The story is subdued as a result of too much sex scenes. The amount of time spent on sexscenes makes it difficult to show how Christian  makes a living.
B008QMMEOE|1.0|It never downloaded into my kindle so I have not been able to use it! All of the other games I have gotten went right into my kindle. This one did not.
B00G32OMF8|4.0|Not as good as the previous 2. Their argument which is the climax of this movie was bit disturbing to me. Maybe it was real but maybe too real.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This was another great read by Grisham with a twist. I could not put it down. I thoroughly enjoyed it!
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|Writers like scientists, stand on the shoulders of giants. While, as Hemingway asserted,  \\"All modern American literature comes from one book by Mark Twain called Huckleberry Finn.\\" all modern detective fiction owes a great debt, if not an acknowledgment of its origin to Edgar Allan Poe and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.<br /><br />In White Fire Lincoln Child and Douglas Preston, not only acknowledge that debt to Conan Doyle, they give us a \\"new\\" unpublished Holmes story which is key to Aloysius Pendergast solving two sets of crimes, separated by nearly a century and a half. Of these crimes, I will simply say, without fear of spoiling anything, that they are closely tied to the environment of a Rocky Mountain ski resort whose life began as a silver camp.<br /><br />To cross not only the Atlantic but the span of time separating these events requires a bit of legerdemain which because of the inclusion of the stand-alone Holmes story is not as hokey as one would expect. And without that connection a great mystery novel would be merely good. One can forgive Preston and Child for this trick, because the trick works spectacularly.<br /><br />This is also a tale about Pendergast's young protege Corrine Swanson, now a junior at John Jay in New York City whose ambition places her at risk. If she is someday have her own series, as I suspect is under consideration, her character needs development. We shall see.<br /><br />All and all,  your winter reading list begins here, althoughI am not sure I would take it to ski Vail this winter.
B00FWAZ87I|4.0|I was a little sad when I heard a few years back that Arjen had run out of ways to express himself via the Ayreon moniker.  Thought it would be the end of it, and all future work would be solo, Star One or Guilt Machine albums.  While none of those options are a bad thing, per se (each of his most recent offerings under those respective names were excellent), I originally was drawn to Arjen's work for Ayreon (The Human Equation, to be precise).  So when I heard he was working on a new album, I started following his posts, and watching the &#34;guess the musician&#34; videos, and the like.  And I got more and more excited.<br /><br />Well, I finally picked the album up a week or two ago, and it was well worth the wait.  Ayreon is very much alive and well, thank you very much.  Is it his best Ayreon work?  No, I think Human Equation, above, or &#34;Y&#34; slightly edges this one out.  Is it awesome?  Oh, hell, yes.
B00ER23V1W|5.0|I loved the movie and simply adored the score, I couldn't wait to order it from Amazon after I'd seen the show… I haven't stopped playing it since it arrived, it makes great driving music.  Pop the disc in and you're right back in the movie with Sandra Bullock in non-stop peril.  Couldn't be better.  Very Vangelis-esq, not so much the Zimmerman-styled riffs we've been over-saturated with of late, a refreshing take, I look forward to more from Mr. Price.
B00FJ7YDV6|5.0|I got this app for my 3 year old granddaughter. She loves trains and loves this app. I was disappointed that in order to finish the story I had to purchase the full app. The app itself is great.
B000002GQE|5.0|The quintessential Moody Blues.  This is one of the classics of my teenybopperdom and Veteran Cosmic Rocker still makes me dance around the the livingroom (to the delight of the dog and the chagrin of everyone else.)
B003B02O0U|5.0|It had my attention from beginning to end.  I could not put it down and can see why it is Grisham's personal favorite.
B007NESBK2|5.0|I don't know how you rate something as subjective as this.  If you like Sade, you'll like this concert video.  If you don't like Sade, you probably aren't reading this.  This is the 2nd concert video of hers that I have.  I like it more than the first one because this one is on Blu-ray so the video clarity is great.  She plays great versions of her songs without taking you way, way off course like so many artists now do.  She's a great entertaining in my opinion, and this video captures that very well.  Definitely worth the money and I'd recommend it to anyone who likes her music.
B0057F869U|5.0|Absolutely love this version of Jane Eyre.  The casting is superb and the chemistry between the characters is strong and poignant. Much more so than other versions I have seen (including the version with William Hurt).  Lady Judy Dench added gravitas to the role of Mrs. Fairfax. I liked it so much that I bought the DVD.
0670026603|5.0|Wonderful book.  I think what was so powerful for me was the impact both Lou and Will had on each other's life.  They were in each other's life a short time, but were willling to be open to a very unconventional type of give and take with each other.  She was the only person he came to truely trust, and I think love.  Even when he had all the priveleges of life, they were not as meaningful as the intamacey Lou gave him. They each gave each other an opportunity to live life to the fullest.  They gave each other what the other one had missed.  This book will stay with you for a long time.  Hard to not turn it over and over in your mind.
B00DKY4LBW|5.0|As expected, the CD arrived in perfect condition, on time.<br /><br />The album itself is a brilliant next step for the Arctic Monkeys. Suck It And See hinted at experimental soulfulness in the guitar and vocal melodies (a la Piledriver Waltz) but didn't allow the attitude and hard-hitting rhythm that previously defined their sound. AM is an excellent fusion of the two ends of their spectrum, and more. Least expected was the fact that AM is basically entirely love songs, and yet it does new things with love songs can only be described by: &#34;Arctic Monkeys&#34;.
1476727651|3.0|its a little slower than other SK books. it took me 100 pages to get into it the last 100 (200) it has picked up some speed. I can put put it down and not get back to it for a few days and its no big deal.  Other books of his I could NOT put down and needed to keep reading all through the night if needed!!
0767919408|5.0|another outstanding work by my favorite author. Bryson is a charming storyteller and an insightful guide through an amazing summer, a pivotal year in our national history.
B006OOHYIC|4.0|4 stars! No game is perfect until you reach the end and you realize that you have enjoyed it the same as when you started.<br />This game makes you think and try different things. I believe that this game everyone will enjoy. You don't have to buy coins because you earn them and if you judiciously use them they will last quite awhile.
B00EB6ENXO|1.0|Totally fraudulent marketing. The top front banner says digital copy, but once you open the box, you find out that there is no iTunes compatible digital copy available on this disk. For iTunes compatibility, you must know ahead of time to buy the deluxe version. Now I am stuck with an unwanted product that I opened, so I can't return it for the right version. Trapped, stuck, taken advantage of, violated.
B0035KGWR2|5.0|One of my favorite pop/rock records of all time. It plays like a greatest hits package. This is Amy's Born In The USA, though her song, Fourth of July, appears on her next album! This is rich pop/rock that the liveliest numbers seem to have an Americana feel. I can't do the artist or the album justice with this little blurb, but this young lady is the queen of rock and roll right now.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I watched all 5 seasons of Fringe and loved it, but I feel the first year is the best.  The weird situations, and especially the funny things that Walter would say...just out of the blue!  And knowing how it all turns out doesn't seem to diminish the fun of the first episodes!
B00026ZG10|5.0|Great movie.  Plot was terrific.  Arnold and Jamie Leigh Curtis were a perfect pair.  Loved the movie. Would love to see anything else with both parties included.
0553801473|3.0|The guy just can't put a period on it! Another 1,000 pages and all you get is some more new characters and no satisfaction with the ones (and there are a lot!) you already know.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I loved &#34;A Time to Kill&#34; and was waiting for a follow-up novel. Sycamore Row carries the theme of racial<br />inequality and ultimate justice through a story with very likeable characters.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Pretty good adaptation of the book. In some ways it's almost better because of the way the book goes on with the, &#34;I say&#34;, &#34;He says&#34; dialogue and in the movie you are spared that.
B001YIJOI6|5.0|Delightful French pop from this lovely and talented French-Canadian. This is better than anything from the 60s. One of my favorite albums.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|It's my grandson's favorite movie available on the Ipad. He watches it again and again. A good family movie. It is my daughter's favorite also.
B00CDT41RY|1.0|Offensive, racial, unbelievable.  I couldn't watch much more than 10 minutes of this movie.  I would not recommend it to anyone.
B00FWLSLJ4|5.0|Mind candy action flick for a weekend afternoon or evening. Fairly quick paced with something blowing up, being blown up or cities being wrecked! Enjoy! ( strictly for Sci-fi action fans needing a 115 minute brain break,)
B000Q67876|5.0|Movies don't come any better made than The Shawshank Redemption. Probably the finest performances ever from Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins and one that tops their entire careers combined.
B00632HWOG|5.0|App works just like regular email; fast functional and always with me wherever I go.  Helps me keep track of what I'm doing
B001HBYH9Q|4.0|Captions didn't work, made it difficult for me to catch the dialogue.<br />Had seen it before; good for when you just want a comfort movie.
B004ZGI2KK|4.0|I love this movie, it's scary but not too scary, and they do an excellent job keeping you guessing on who the &#34;wolf&#34; is!!!
B00BBW16HW|5.0|Every health care professional should be required to watch this movie.  It shows the human side of a disabled man and the chance he gives to the care giver who is not the &#34;standard.&#34;
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|It's so helpful and perfect that I cant believe it's free. I keep on waiting for it to give me like my monthly payment or something but it hasn't.  :)  I highly reccomend it to all.
B0088T3B0G|1.0|Too much profanity and too dark. I was in the mood for a good guys dominate the bad guys movie, so I couldn't sit through an Oceans 11 type movie. I didn't finish it so I realize this is not an objective review.
B001ESSJ3M|5.0|Awesome album...a really accessible Tom Waits record for those who are newly listening to him.  Even for me, who has listened to him for years, this is a really nice, kickback and enjoy, peice of work. Jazz, blues with the poetry of Waits lyrics....
B000MF4O82|5.0|First this was a guilty pleasure &#34;so bad it's funny&#34;, then I realized it is the most sly, brilliant satire I have ever seen. As a satire of militarism, this beats even the classic &#34;Dr. Strangelove&#34;, which is a personal all-time favorite.<br /><br />As a work of satire, ST seems most directed at militarism's (and fascism's) effect on politics, pedagogy, relationships, mass media, public intellectuals, everything except the actual military.<br /><br />The military itself in ST is satirized less harshly, which I find entirely appropriate.<br /><br />ST is an all-time classic on many levels.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Costumes beautiful, acting terrific, engaging plot all add up to great entertainment. Once you start you can't wait for the next episode.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Such a well-crafted story populated with unforgetable characters and a narrator whose voice echoes in my mind long after I stop reading, this is an incredible book!  I had no idea, going into this read, of the topic or anything about the book, and what a gem it was to discover--better late than never!!  I understand it's been made into a movie, yet I have no desire to see it--I saw it all so clearly as I read, and fear that any attempt to portray the narrator and his characters, other than as was so masterfully done by the author, would be a disappointment.  It's been done in the pages of the book to the point that this story will live in my mind vividly forever!
B00B8R1NP0|4.0|The storyline was pretty good original even. I would have liked to get to know the characters more and i thought the way they talked to each other was weird. Like they said each others names too often or after jesse would say something there were exclamation points and it just read weird. But i would definitely read the next book to find out more about max and jesse i think the author introduced 2 good characters that make a good team
B002NT3B52|5.0|I just cannot express how much I enjoyed this book.  Ms. Horowitz's writing is casually elegant and she treats her subject with objective, but loving care.  It seems to me that no one but a dog owner/lover could be so insightful.  I genuinely appreciate her scientific approach, delivered in an &#34;everyman&#34; sort of way.<br /><br />I've had dogs from the no-so-bright to the, recently, very bright.  She gives me insight into this range of personality, helping me understand why I loved them all.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|Inspiring and uplifting story-- but be warned that the devastation of the tsunami is truly heartbreaking. Not for the tender of heart.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|This DVD is great, as it has extras that add even more to the greatest television show ever on TV

0525952616|3.0|In “Kill Decision” a growing number of mysterious deaths point to a single cause – autonomous unpiloted machines, drones.  The drones commit acts of sabotage or murder, and then self-destruct.  Nothing ties the drones to the people who unleashed them, leading to the disturbing conclusion that the machines are acting on their own, blessed with a new form of artificial intelligence requiring little if any human intervention.  Linda McKinney, a scientist studying ant colonies, finds herself coopted by a mysterious US Army special forces team.  Their mission learn how the drones work and discover the secret of their employer.<br /><br />Like many here, I was drawn to “Kill Decision” by the promise of “Daemon” which I enjoyed back in 2009.  While “Kill Decision” seems a natural idea given the other books, Suarez makes a critical mistake in leaving out everything that made those other books so much fun.  Like “Kill”, “Daemon” involved the impact of an implacable and enigmatic new form of intelligence.  What set “Daemon” apart from similarly-themed stories was its wise sidestepping of the underlying technology, and instead focusing on a wide range of characters coming to grips with a dramatically changing world.  Many of these characters were not technologically adept, allowing Suarez to delay revealing whether the ominous Daemon was real and as powerful as promised.  “Kill Decision” avoids that by populating itself with scientists and special forces troops, secretive agents and shadow-government enforcers.  Readers of “Daemon” who enjoyed following beleaguered Pete Sebeck, Tripwire Meritte and Loki Stormbringer – outsiders forced to come to terms with the titular AI - will find little to match in “Kill”.<br /><br />Also unlike “Daemon” we too quickly learn that the AI is real and learn enough of what it’s capable of doing because Suarez has a handy supply of experts around to explain everything – and spoil the story.Kill” is so eager to prove itself “eerily plausible” that it quickly loses any sense of mystery.  Instead, it navigates itself to an action-packed climax that feels forced – the book has to end somewhere, right?  Unfortunately, the climax – pitting the special forces heroes against a hive of drones - isn’t all that climactic since readers will have already been primed to expect an insect cloud of them.  By then, I was scratching my head – the drones are meant to create a new paradigm for warfare, but just seem grandiose.  In an age of shoe-bombs and wire cutters, is somebody going to really need laser-guided missiles and drones to deal with computer programmers and entomologists?  Suarez not only believes it does but makes that call early in the story, quickly establishing that “Kill Decision” will choose “overkill”.<br /><br />It may take a lot of research to lay down the basics of technology for a story like “Kill Decision”, but only a determined writer can take the next step and show how that technology affects other human beings.  Suarez did it with “Daemon” but didn’t pull that off here.
0812993845|3.0|This book was okay.  I thought it was the book that will never end.  It seemed liked she was trying to stretch a short story into a novel.  To be frank, a lot of it was just plain stupid.  I will not be purchasing any more of her books.  No worth the time...
B00BVYJG18|5.0|Killswitch Engage is a name that is synonymous these days with the term &#34;metalcore&#34; thanks in part to their recent mainstream success and appeal over the last several years.  With the departure of Howard Jones after the commercial success of albums such as &#34;As Daylight Dies&#34; and their 2009 self-titled album, fans were wary about the band's future.  When the announcement that the replacement vocalist was non other than the band's original vocalist, Jesse Leach, all fears dissipated, in fact, the return of Jesse Leach marks a return to a more aggressive Killswitch Engage that hadn't been seen in years.<br /><br />With the release of the band's original self titled album in 2000, Killswitch Engage had created a unique sound and style that differentiated the group from its peers, establishing themselves as a forerunner in the early metalcore scene.  Jesse Leach managed to combine aggression of modern metal with speed and energy of punk rock music, utilizing a wide array of vocal techniques that remain unique to this day.  Following the release of their sophomore album, &#34;Alive or Just Breathing&#34;, Jesse Leach left the band and the style of Killswitch Engage began to change with each successive album.<br /><br />Howard Jones and Jesse Leach are both talented vocalists who happen to use different vocal styles than one another.  Whereas Howard Jones leaned more towards dynamic and powerful clean vocalization of lyrics, Jesse Leach is probably the mirror opposite of Howard, seeing as he's more known for his aggressive yells, screams and growls.  Under the reins of Jones, the band lost most of its aggression throughout the years in favor of creating more radio friendly material.<br /><br />With the return of Jesse Leach, Killswitch Engage continues exactly where they left off.  Feeling like a true follow up to &#34;Alive of Just Breathing&#34;, &#34;Disarm the Descent&#34; feels like a time machine that takes the listener back to the early 2000's when the band was just starting out, only with obvious signs of evolution present throughout the duration of the album.<br /><br />The instrumentation is more raw, aggressive and dynamic than their previous album.  The rhythm is faster, relying on more blast beats than before and creating a much more technical and resonating tempo for the majority of the songs.  The guitars also see a return to a heavier set of riffs and strumming, resembling the style found on &#34;Alive or Just Breathing&#34;.  Overall, every instrument sounds as if the person behind it has been rejuvenated, as if new energy has been pumped back into the band.  What truly stands out on &#34;Disarm the Descent&#34; however are the vocals.<br /><br />Jesse Leach returns to Killswitch Engage without skipping a beat.  Leach has evolved since his previous time with the group, his growls are more refined and pronounced and his clean singing has improved significantly as well.  Comparing two of the most known singles created by Killswitch Engage with Leach as the front man, it's possible to see just how much the band has evolved over the years, yet the return of Jesse makes it also feel so familiar at the same time.  &#34;My Last Serenade&#34; showcased Jesse has a prime example of what a metalcore frontman should sound like.  The single from &#34;Disarm the Descent&#34; entitled &#34;In Due Time&#34; is a very comparable song to &#34;My Last Serenade&#34; in regards to the manner in which it allows Jesse to present himself as still one of the most talented and relevant vocalists within the modern metalcore genre.  The track is aggressive, catchy, powerful, yet melodic at the same time.<br /><br />The album contains in this fashion, blending melody with catchy hooks, heavy riffs, fast paced rhythms and poly-rhythms, blast beats, and the occasional breakdown.  Even the slower tracks, such as &#34;Always&#34; manage to feel real, seeping with true emotion, rather than feeling forced or faked, and the track fitsright in with the remainder of the album instead of ruining its consistency or flow.<br /><br />Overall, &#34;Disarm the Descent&#34; is a must buy for fans of Killswitch Engage (especially older Killswitch Engage fans).  It's also an album that all fans of metalcore should purchase since it defines what it means to be a metalcore band in every aspect regarding the definition of the genre.  The album is full of raw emotion, excellent instrumentation, and dynamic vocalization, creating a blend of what is possibly one of the best metalcore albums to be released within the last five years.  Previous releases had fans of the band believing that the group was more focused on radio play than aggressive metal.  The return of Jesse Leach seems to have brought new life back into the band, setting them on a voyage in a new direction that may have them once again as the metalcore that every other band wants to beat.  A testament to what this album is.right in with the remainder of the album instead of ruining its consistency or flow.<br /><br />Overall, &#34;Disarm the Descent&#34; is a must buy for fans of Killswitch Engage (especially older Killswitch Engage fans).

B005HJU7HA|5.0|The Complete Sherlock Holmes... by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle ,Copyright 2012<br /><br />  Although I am not finished with the book yet, I will give what I have encountered thus far.<br />Sherlock Holmes has a way of seeing evidence that eludes the ordinary person. His gift of observation is something to be admired. His skill at solving cases makes for an interesting story. The cases are interesting in themselves with an old world setting around the 1870's ,80's in and around London.
B0063IH60K|5.0|A great time waster.  Lots of fun.  Could spend hours with this game. I love the ones where I don't have to think a lot.
B00E9ZATJO|4.0|Not the best of the pixar films but definitely a good one.<br /><br />Monster's University is set before Monster's Inc.  We see a young Mike growing up with the desire to join Monster's Inc by attending the scare department of Monster's University.  The story is a basic one.  Its basically the old story of the geeks versus the jocks.  With the unlikely villain becomes hero of Sulley, who ultimately helps the geeks prevail.<br /><br />Mike knows all his subject matter but just is not scary enough to succeed so when faced with getting kicked out of the program he makes a deal with the Dean if he wins the scare games he will be allowed to stay in the program.<br /><br />The laughs are definitely there, from the first time you meet Mike to his ride on the pig across the quad its a good time.  The characters area ll well done and of course the monsters are unique.  Pixar may not be what it was under Steve Jobs, but this movie is definitely one of the better ones.<br /><br />I recommend it for all.
B005LAIHY0|2.0|\\"Prometheus\\" (the movie set in the same universe as \\"Alien\\" but don't call it a \\"prequel) is a beautiful failure, and it is the failure that prevails over beauty.  Despite awesome visuals, \\"Prometheus\\" leaves you with a lot of plot wholes and WTF moments.<br /><br />But first - what it's about<br /><br />\\"Prometheus\\" begins with a giant humanoid being walking near the top of a waterfall on an apparently pristine world.  Drinking something, he begins to slowly and agonizingly die - his body disintegrating while he's still alive.  We see his DNA break apart...only to miraculously reassemble themselves and begin forming new organisms.  Is this Earth - are we watching the creation of us?  The story jumps ahead to the late 21st century.  Archaeologists have found evidence of the giant humanoid's presence in drawings and inscriptions made by a number of Earth's unconnected pre-modern cultures.  Scientists Elizabeth Shaw and Charlie Halloway makes a dramatic deduction - the beings are engineers...of us.  Grabbing the attention of Peter Weyland, the chief of the huge Weyland-Yutani company, Shaw and Halloway are given the massive deep-space exploration Ship \\"Prometheus\\".  Their destination: a possibly habitable moon located in the orbit of a planet in a distant system, one that appears to match that found in the ancient cave drawings.  Their mission, under the nominal control of Meredith Vickers - a cybernetically sleek corporate rep - seek out the engineers and in so doing, learn the secret of mankind's existence.<br /><br />Now what WE thought:<br /><br />We confess we were seduced by the 1979-Alien-trailer style trailer for this movie.  Very few movies live up to their trailer, but the one for \\"Prometheus\\" was strongly suggested a very compelling story: scientists set foot on a distant world and discover remains of an advanced civilization.  They dig deeper for more clues, inevitably tampering and setting in motion some horrible secret left dormant by that civilization.Soon the scientists find themselves dealing not with an ancient dead secret but with a very real and living nightmare.  At first the terror appears minimal - more ominous than implacable - and the scientists believe they can contain it using their powers of reason.  Each attempt do so fails, and the terror only grows, creating a pyramid of fear, desperation, agony and horrible death.<br /><br />That was the movie the trailer promised.<br /><br />\\"Prometheus\\", the real movie, is completely different.  The scientists don't act very scientific - in fact they don't do much at all.  Ultimately, all the work falls on David, a beautifully artificial person programmed to speak ancient languages, read alien hieroglyphics, operate the technology of highly evolved civilizations and quote lines from \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\".  (Like Lawrence, David has left civilization for an alien wilderness - finding himself an anomaly in both.)  Although the scientists do find the world LV-223 to hold a catalog of horrors, the scenes of death and destruction barely link to each other as the trailer suggests they will.  At times it seems each episode of horror comes from a different movie, and none of them are all that vital to the overall story.<br /><br />What really kills \\"Prometheus\\" is the lack of a central mythos - that overarching story that holds up the one we see on screen.  The myth doesn't have to be fully detailed or even correct, but it must be compelling and specific enough to drive our characters, and exotic and scary enough to fulfill the promise of science-fiction and horror.  In \\"ancient astronaut\\" stories like \\"Prometheus\\" - The Mountains of Madness\\", \\"The Thing\\", \\"Five Million Years to Earth\\" or \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\" - the myth is bound by the actions and motives of godlike and long-dead beings.  The myth can be used to explain the \\"why\\" of the story, and while it can be vague, there should be enough to suggest something more than anybody can come up with on the IMDB message board for Prometheus.  There is only a paltry attempt at a myth here (the engineers created us), one that the scientist protagonists uncharacteristically avoid discussing (if engineers and humans have the same DNA, then that means that they are basically the same creature as us, rather than our creators; also if that was Earth at the beginning of the movie, and the dying Engineer brought life to it, then it means that Engineers have been physically unchanged for half a billion years - a span of time that saw dinosaurs rise from small reptiles to giant monsters and then shrink to become birds.  You'd think that scientists who crossed light years of space would have something to say about that).<br /><br />Despite its lovely looks, there's enough on the surface of \\"Prometheus\\" to make you scratch your head - from David's effortless navigation of an ancient alien spaceship, to Shaw's and Vickers desperately trying to escape a falling spacecraft (they look like Fred and Barney running away from a wild brontosaurus).  It's possible that \\"Prometheus\\" actually suffers for its beauty.  The movie is so primed to wow you with awesome visuals that it tosses out \\"The Code of Alien\\" which requires that terror be as unseen as possible.  Instead, the screen is packed with alien snakes, alien squid, holograms of engineer armies, holographic space navigation computers and reforming DNA.  Eventually we see so much that we're primed to expect anything except a story to make sense of it all.
B00CTSDDVO|4.0|I dont care for the 3D effects as I am a popout and depth kinda person I love having both and thats why I gave 4 stars. But I am a trekky and the 3D version of this movie is not much more than the non 3D they did do a great job on bringing this one back. Still not as good as the Capt Kirk days but it is great

B00BEK6Z7M|3.0|Fast read. Good st<br />ory, but I feel they are becoming a bit predictable in their story lines. Don't get me wrong, they are still my favorite authors and I will keep reading everything they write.  I just wish this had not just come out, what am I to read next?
B001JDS7CU|5.0|Phenomenal Bluray set.  Absolutely stunning views of the planet we live on.  MUST HAVE if you like nature.  Also, david attenborough does a good job narrating the series.  I also recommend the &#34;Life&#34; series as well.

B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|As always I buy these movies honestly not for the storyline as much as I am looking for the popout effects for 3D viewing (Im an overgrown kid what can I say) anyway this movie had a few decent effects in it but it turned out to have a VERY great awesome storyline to it as well so I got the bonus. Its a great movie

B00E72OKAS|5.0|GREAT GAME!!!!!!!  Kinda went by fast. But only cause it was soooooooo addicting! Pretty gory so probably not recommended for small kids....
B00D6C0D42|5.0|Brazil is definitely an intelligent, metaphorical, and even timeless motion picture.  It's very appealing to the social-economic thinker and an excellent reference for what has a potential to be disastrous arising from inclination.
B00F91H15W|5.0|The Bling Ring by Nancy Jo Sales is one of the best books I have ever read. It opened my eyes about how corrupt some of todays youth really are and the out of control envy some people have for todays &#34;rich and famous&#34;. It's filled with drama, suspense and the crazy ability that these kids had to deceive people so well and for so long.<br />The cool thing about this book is that it is 100% a true story. There were so many times I found myself saying &#34;No way!&#34; but all of the things that happened in this book happened in real life a few years ago. It's about a group of teenagers, later known as &#34;The Bling Ring&#34;, that went around robbing celebrities such as Paris Hilton, Lindsay Lohan, Audrina Partridge, Orlando Bloom, Megan Fox and plotted to rob many many more. Rachel and Nick, known as the &#34;Ring Leaders&#34;, initially started this fad these teenagers had. They later got friends to join them. They stole millions of dollars worth of items such as purses, shoes, watches and tons more. These fame, young hollywood obsessed, materialistic, &#34;rich&#34; kids wanted it all and were going at all costs to get it. Some of the things the kids did were sickening and quiet scary... such as steeling Megan Fox's hand gun and playing around with it and steeling money to buy cocaine which led to addiction for some of the kids. But while this story has serious topics there are some twists that cause you to laugh. Such as when Nick and the kids go to Paris Hiltons house and try on her shoes... You find out that Paris Hilton wears a size 11 shoe! And because of this, Nick steals these pink pumps and wears them around, its corrupt but funny at the same time.<br />I just overall loved this book for how real it was... but for how unreal and unbelievable it was at the same time. This book isn't laid out in a typical &#34;story&#34; format like most of us are used to. It is written from Nancy, the author's, prospective and point of few and it is the facts aboutwhat happened while her opinions are also stated and included. It's all about her interviews and encounters with the kids, the research, and the things Nancy went through in order to help make this true story into a movie (which I recommend watching).<br />I would suggest this book to mature teenagers and women of all ages or even men that are interested in a hollywood, fame obsessed themed book. It is a great, entertaining read with a great unintentional message. I give it a 5 out of 5 stars! Read it!
B008SAZHLQ|4.0|Honestly, I was totally into this book and the characters until the very last page. At that point I was just disappointed. I imagine others might love it.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|A heartwarming story, without being over-the-top sappy.  It makes for a pleasant evening of light entertainment that pretty much anyone will enjoy.
0375842209|5.0|The book Thief is beautiful prose, haunting story, memorable, loving characters in a story of humanity's best and worst moments in time.
B008602KQI|5.0|good movie and never had a problem with it's streaming. Never a stop or slowdown. Watched it on my pc
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Great little gadget - easy set up, it plays -  Now we just need more compatible apps - LIKE HBOnordic-
0385360169|2.0|Bought the Audio version because I heard so much about it that I was<br />curious.  I have bought many CD's for my long commute over the years,<br />and this is the first one that I can say has absolutely no story at all. I would<br />rate it at the very bottom of the list.
B008I43DYU|1.0|Same as the FREE calculator app.!!  No % sign!  So what am I not getting in the &#34;PRO&#34; model that I did not get in the FREE model!!?
B00BF11UM0|5.0|Even though you know how it ends, it keeps you on the edge of your seat.  I understand that the movie deviates from the actual events in some areas, but that overall it presents a reasonable summary of what happened.  It deserves all the positive prss I have read about it.  Even my wife, who hates suspense or violence in movies thoroughly enjoyed it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My son loves this. He's seven and likes to set it to creative mode just so he can build, hunt, explore and take care of animals. If they are a lego lover, they will love this too.
B000P407K4|4.0|The film is a pretty hilarious satire of the cold war. The actors do an amazing job of staying in character and conveying the caricature of each of the different characters.
B00A6CCF0K|2.0|I don't understand how this book is getting so many great reviews. I really don't.  Hey, I'm a huge King fan, and I read The Shining back in the 80's and was beyond thrilled to learn he'd just written a sequel. Because that premise is so full of.... potential!<br /><br />And the book starts with a massive bang.  The first section of the book is intense, chilling, left me breathlessly wanting more and reading into all hours of the night because I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />And then it derailed in a massive way.<br /><br />Spoilers galore coming. You've been warned.  But I reveal them because I care, and because you should not waste your time reading this book.<br /><br />First off, there's a LOT of Alcoholics Anonymous stuff in this book.  It's very relevant to the story, and works overall, but to say it goes into preachy is an understatement.  It's so over the top in your face that it gets in the way of the storytelling.  Want to read about how a real-life alcoholic writer put his booze demons behind him, and then wrote about it in a creative way?  Check out &#34;Last Call&#34; by Tim Powers.  Alcohol is a terrifying force in that book, and it's handled far more creatively than in Dr. Sleep.<br /><br />But the biggest sin of all -- hands down -- is that the good guys in the story are vastly more powerful than the bad guys.<br /><br />Wait a sec, I'm jumping ahead here.<br /><br />Let me clarify that after the first section of the book, all notions of horror are thrown out the window, and instead the book becomes a modern day adventure story. Instead of a dragon or a witch, the good guys are now fighting vampires (kinda sorta but close enough). But these monsters are so.... blah... that they are almost pathetic.  The only one with any gravitas is their ringleader, Rose the Hat. And she'd be ok, except that she's got her sights set on one particular victim, a girl named Abra, who befriends Dan Torrance through their mutual psychic link. Like Danny and the chef from the first novel.<br /><br />What makes Abra such a target is her massive power, which is attractive to creatures like Rose and her gang.  They want to ingest it.  But Abra's massive power makes her about 20 times stronger than Rose, who is used to being king of the roost.<br /><br />So instead of outwitting a deadly foe, the story's climax is a whimpering step-by-step account of how Goliath kicked the living daylights out of poor little David.  Or how Jaws ate all those tiny little minnows.<br /><br />Seriously, the girl kicks some major butt. You're never worried for her.  Even in the one brief section where she loses the upper hand for a chapter or two, she's so insanely powerful you know she's going to free herself, and she does with absurd ease.<br /><br />I've never been this bored reading about the battle between good vs. evil before.  Skip this, there are too many great books out there.
B00DAXYNEI|5.0|Amazing show!  Can't wait for next season. Well worth the money...best TV in years!!!! Kevin Spacey is brilliant.  Political power corrupts the morals and judgement of all who obtain it.  This show is all about political power and its corrupting influence! Gee...if we could only elect the right people into office then they would not abuse political power!
0312370830|5.0|It was shipped quickly, packaged well, new - and it is just as I ordered. A must read for anyone interested in the Holocaust.<br />Recommend.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I just love it.  It does everything except wash the dishes.  The only sad thing is...there isn't.  It's simply a good app.  And, for those in the know, it somehow knows all the numbers in every language.
B00B8P3EOU|5.0|I'm thrilled this has been re-mastered and released.  It's an absolutely beautiful album.  Fandango itself is now a classic. Quiereme Tal Como Soy blew my mind and how could you not love Push and Pull? It makes you want to get up and move like crazy.  California Blues is seductively sad and Aria is exquisite (named for his daughter?) - I could go on - each song has a different and amazing feel. Herb never disappoints; the whole thing is genius.
B00FWLSLJ4|3.0|Rented through Amazon and my PS3.  Movie was very good.  The sound deliver was terrible though and had to watch with subtiltes.  Might not rent again based on this.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|It's wierd to say that I loved this book, because it's so painful.  Still, it gives such a realistic view of life in North Korea.  This is way more than just the story of one man's escape.  Blaine fills out the story with eye-opening context from escapees from other camps and as well as other defectors.  It is like looking into North Korea with a periscope to see what's really going on.<br /><br />This story is very relevant to the current situation, such as the news that broke this month (Nov. 2013) of the public execution of 80 accused of watching South Korean dramas or posessing Bibles.  Such repression just boggles the mind.
0385343248|5.0|Lots of interesting characters as well as a fascinating plot.  A great window into a different culture and a different time.  I read it when it first came out decades ago, and had to read it again.  I loved it both times.
1250038820|5.0|Inspiring. A wonderful book. I love paging through it and marveling at the incredible diversity of this great city. I heartily recommend this book.
B00BMR5HOO|5.0|love it, it is accurate, gives me a good forecast for the next twenty four hours anywhere in the world, easy to use, simple, direct
B000QFW7UA|5.0|I'm not going to review the movie-it speaks for itself. Plus, if you're spending the extra movie to buy this 25th Anniversary Edition, you've already watched and love the movie.<br /><br />I'm going to review the 25th Ann. Edition set. The box it comes in is great. The coloring, 3D effects, and the subject matter all work well together. When you open it up to reveal the inside, the map from the movie is shown along with the metal &#34;skull key&#34; from the movie. The items all slide out towards the middle of the box. The storyboard cards are interesting to look at and come in a protective envelope. The other two inserts-the magazine replica and the article reprint are kept next to them as well, sandwiched between the game and the movie. The movie is a bit shorter than everything else, so they've put a cardboard insert to keep it from sliding around.<br /><br />The magazine and article are in fairly small typing, but are fun to look through.<br /><br />The game itself is kept in a box, then a plastic case and is all shrink wrapped. The cards, game pieces and board are individually shrink wrapped as well. The board is fairly heavy duty. I'd say it's made just like a normal game board, just a bit smaller. Folds out larger than expected-didn't measure but at least 12x18. It's big enough to easily play and sturdy enough you're not going to need to be super careful with it either.<br /><br />The movie is a BR. The one negative is that they don't include the DVD as well-as this is the Anniversary Edition, it'd be nice to have both. I was able to insert my old DVD and call it a day, though.<br /><br />If you're a big fan of the movie-this edition is the way to go!
B0012QTT4O|2.0|As promised, the acting, cinematography, and general production values are top notch.  But like the Sopranos, I find the content toxic and depressing.  There is already a pattern of a buildup of tension and a narrow escape.  This chemistry teacher is going to have to come up with more complicated strategies to pull off this double life.  But he seems to have a sociopathic disregard for the lives he's destroying even as his own body is wasting away.  I'm simply not up for 40 more hours of covert drug manufacturers.
B00FSCLMUW|5.0|This is Freshest hits album ever!!! What Laura did hear is redo (or remaster or do live) all the songs perviously released. Some are duets such as Non C'e with Marc Anthony., some with full orchestrations such as La Solatudane with Enrico Marricone which is just fantastic. Some are slowed down or done in a different way. Its all very well done. Along with a few new recordings for Laura Its like getting a new CD, really two there are a few versions of this out, the minimum number of tracks is 20 there are 39 tracks on the deluxe editions. Also the above version 20 Grandes Exitos is gerend to the Spanish speaking market (or Latin Music Market) while 20 Greatest Hits is greened to Italian and English Markets. So pick the version you want, I would surest you get the deluxe of either through, its wonderful and the extra tracks are great. Pausini is a wonderful singer she has a seductive and great voice and can interpret a song in many ways.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Terrible ending.  If you like books where a terrible, horrible crazy person does a ton of horrible terrible things to people and completely gets away with it scott free and then goes on to (presumably) have a child that will be subjected to a sociopathic mother and....I don't even know what you would call him father then sure...go ahead and read this.  I wish I could erase this book from my brain.
B00GHJ6BJW|5.0|LOVE this album! Every song is super catchy and so full of energy. My favorites are Venus, Do What You Want, and Fashion!
0345533666|5.0|This was an excellent book.  Fascinating to the end, which caught me completely by surprise.  I recommend this book, especially to book clubs.  Great discussion.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Was so looking forward the  final book of trilogy. This was not as good as Divergent and Insurgent, bit of a letdown.....
B000UR9T82|5.0|I've always been a fan of this version of the Spider-Man story over the latest version that has been released. While this Blu-Ray trilogy does not have the special features of other editions, if you are like me, you are more interested in the movie itself rather than the presence of those features. However, in this product, the Blu-Ray for Spider-Man 2 does give you the option of watching the PG-13 version, or the &#34;unrated&#34; version, the latter appearing to simply be a slightly extended version of the PG-13 version. Yeah, I know, that's not what most of us normally think of when we hear &#34;unrated version,&#34; but I didn't see or hear any reason for the unrated version to be given any other rating higher than PG-13. Spider-Man 3 did come with another disk of special features, but as I am a &#34;movie only&#34; guy, I haven't watched it yet. The sound, clarity, and quality of the picture is excellent, and only gets better with each movie. I highly recommend this product! ...and I hope to see Tobey Maguire play Spider-Man again one day!

6305558167|5.0|This version of Excalibur is a classic in my book.  Never get tired of watching it.  No bad language, some nudity.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Love the story line!  Great book. Kept me reading all night. Couldn't put it down :). Love that he calls her pigeon
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Khalid Hosseini has once again captured life in Afghanistan pre and post 9/11. The intertwining stories are wonderful in that they lead the reader through the tangled connections of individuals in addition to the knotted history of Afghanistan. I especially like how the ending starts at the beginning. His characters and their connections to their families is very compelling and yet has the aspect of real life in that it's not always the perfect Fairytale ending.
B003XDUCIG|4.0|Very awesome reading..many tips, causes and reason that I wasn't aware...excellent complement to who like cook and improve, and the more important..understand the art of cocking
B00FLDG42Y|5.0|RUSH always delivers. This is fantastic, I just downloaded the Rip hear at Amazon, and the CD set is on the way, I Had to have a hard copy; RUSH is one of the greatest bands of all time and they never disappoint live. This is just another in a long live of great RUSH live albums and is a must get for all us fans. Its  a mix of song spanning there shoe, career and newer never recorded live songs before. It sounds fantastic. 31 great RUSH songs Live.
1593275080|5.0|Beautiful LEGO includes lots of stunning architectural landmarks and buildings, like Mont-Saint-Michel. Since Lego has a kind of nerdy reputation, that there might be a few fandom pieces as well. And there are numerous Transformer-type robots, and spaceships inspired by seemingly every major sci-fi fandom there is.<br /><br />But what I did not expect were the many figural pieces included, both humorously comic and strikingly dramatic, ranging from the nearly photo-realistic to the artistically abstract. It’s amazing to see the potential for these simple bricks to create serious, substantial, authentic works of art. What becomes clear is that many artists are making Lego brick sculptures wherein the digital and pixellated becomes real. And then, unreal.<br /><br />My favorite work in this lovely, well-bound, 267-page coffee table book, is Nathan Sawaya’s “Red Dress,” which shows a large red dress hanging in the breeze and as the full skirt billows in the wind, it begins to dissolve into various pixels/bricks, as the wind gradually dissolves it into the air. It is a wonderful work for both the sophisticated modern artist — and creative, curious child — in all of us.<br /><br />I should note that no instructions are included in Beautiful LEGO and text is limited primarily to personal essays from the artists themselves.  It's just amazing to see the artists' creations!
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|I bought this for my husband and son. They watch it every year at Christmas-time. The video works great, I have no complaints!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Way better then the movie. If you are a zombie then you have to read this book.  It starts up slow but once you get going you won't be able to put it down.
B00EI2Y4MQ|4.0|Not the greatest UI, but very functional. Would be better if simple equations included comma/ period separators. Change that and the UI five stars.
B007HACDLK|3.0|A typically good Vince Flynn book.  His Mitch Rapp character is a little over the top but I still enjoyed the story.  I always enjoy Vince's books.  I am going to miss him.
B005S9EKCW|3.0|I have never seen any rendition nor read any rendition before this. That being said, I felt like they could have done a better job. HOWEVER, it has gotten me interested and I wish to find a better telling of this tale.
B008X9IH9G|5.0|Gotta love the one, the original - Poltergeist!! Now, in HD!! This has got to be one of the most revered 80s Sci-Fi/Horror films of all time! The entire cast did a spectacular job and the special effects were top notch at the time! So much so, that even many of today's films still don't rival the impact of the visuals seen in this epic motion picture! If you haven't seen this, now's the time! <br /><br />Rest in Peace, Heather O'Rourke and Dominique Dunne.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|This movie is just as great as it was when I was younger. I was glad that there weren't any cut scenes like in the televised versions. Love it!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Very well done and very touching! Moyes does a great job exposing the emotions associated with the main event.  A definite read!
B00C5R7B0I|4.0|I almost put this book down shortly after starting it and am so glad I did not!  I had so tired of Scarpetta's navel gazing  over Marino, and circumstances early on had her doing just that.  I think, though, that Ms. Cornwell did that to set the ship aright and put Marino into his proper place in the mix of characters.<br /><br />My characters, as I grew to know and love them are back!  Kay's the center of this book's focus; and nobody on her team is scheming behind her back or trying to spare her from something they think she shouldn't know.  Benton actually acquired some dimension; and Lucy is the powerhouse brainchild character who I have no doubt could and would handle any personal drama outside the covers of the book.  As it should be.<br /><br />The only negative I came away with is that I would like for the group to be involved in solving a crime that didn't involve them, either directly or tangentially.<br /><br />The ending was a treat!  The last two chapters provide a snapshot of who these people are to each other, and I don't think I'm giving anything away when I say that I wish Ms. Cornwell had provided the label of the wine Kay uncorked in the kitchen.  I could smell and taste it through my Kindle!  So what can I do but pour myself a glass of Jules Taylor Sauvignon Blanc - 2012 - and toast Ms. Cornwell and Kay Scarpetta!<br /><br />Salud!
B00BP0NI1M|5.0|clear, concise and factual. Ms. Moyo documents her examples well....and makes convincing arguments. Recommended fr  all involved with sub-Saharan Africa.
B000008DKH|5.0|Downtown lights. Listen to the Blue Nile's version, then Annie Lennox's version. This band is to rock music what Edward Hopper is to art. Paul Buchanan's voice comes from some place that lives between pathos and longing. Despite the reliance on electronic instruments, these chaps have created some weird version of soul music that never seems to age or fade after years of listening. How this band ever snagged a record deal is beyond me, given the music industry's focus on hit-friendly music...this is a required taste that stays with you long after the music stops. Indeed, this music requires a few spins, but once it grabs you, you are pulled in...just as I am, again and again.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|One of the best book I ever read and will read again in the future. A book that makes you want more.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|this game is a lot of fun.simple yet challenging. the only problem it is slows my kindle down. All of the apps pictures grey out and there is serious lag. I uninstalled and problem stopped. loaded it again and lag once again. too bad because its not worth the problems
B005HEPIDS|5.0|Timeless!  It was a great way to spend some time escaping. I want to be Hathaway when I grow up...😉
0061950726|5.0|For the plot, there are other reviews.  the reviews I like are the ones that tell you why its a good or great or bad book ...so skip this review if you don't like that type.  This was a sweet, well written book.  If you liked &#34;Saving CeeCee Honeycutt&#34; and &#34;On the Corner of Bitter and Sweet&#34; this is the book for you.  Historical fiction juxtapositioned with present characters it spans generations - as it did with us, I have shared this book with friends and my grandmother and all have enjoyed the read.
B002SRQ214|4.0|Pretty zippy quad-core unit at a decent price point. More than adequate for a mid-level system build, and suitable for any modern system. Sure, it's not the top-of-the-line, but it is the previous 'flagship' chip, and more than adequate, as stated. Good power, cache, and heat parameters, and fast speed capacity. An excellent buy
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Great story teller. Being an attorney and now a judge I can see so much of what happened in this book that has been similar in mine. Excellent! I could not put it down.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|If you are not reading Nalini Singh, you are missing out. She is one of the best and most unique PNR/SciFi writers out there. She writes interesting characters and tasteful, yet hot, romance. I look forward to each and every one of her Psy Changling books because I know she will not disappoint. Heart of Obsidian was no exception. Kaleb has been an intriguing character since the beginning of the series and I was so happy to see his story come to fruition. This is not a book that you can just pick up and read. I highly recommend reading the rest of the series in order to get the full effect of the complex nature of this story. It's so worth it!
B000FCKGPC|4.0|Very enjoyable read, with all the surprises you could want.  Must get the next book now!  I hate suspenseful endings.
B007HACDLK|5.0|anything Flynn is fantastic.  I presume he is now writing for the Almighty.  I hope there are some unpublished works so I can enjoy him a little longer.
B003V5CFV8|5.0|This is a classic. It starts out a little odd but as you continue to watch it you see the journey the three men are on is very relevant to any time in history. The music is and added plus.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|The book gave a good education of the challenges of being a quad and quad caregiver. At the same time, the story kept me wanting to read without being too depressed about the situation.
B0042KA5EK|4.0|I like the series. The first year may be the best before so many characters get introduced. Good villain also.
B00BGD8CFK|5.0|The packaging was so good I still have it as package design reference. The case really is &#34;Slim Armor&#34; and has protected my iPhone 5s from a few drops already.  The case doesn't really add much weight to the phone and I find that I can grip it better with the case on than off.<br /><br />Heads up though, make sure you check your power cables (non-Apple) and headphone plugs will fit in the appropriate holes, I have a generic power cable that won't charge it because the plastic was too big.<br /><br />Other than that, I'm extremely happy with this case.  My only downside to having this case is that I want to get some of the other colors now!
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|This was very fun and very entertaining. Great singing and a feel good movie that is well worth your time.
B00ARHAAZ6|4.0|I almost gave Steelheart 3 stars, but it was more entertaining than that.  I was really looking forward to reading this, expecting a much easier read after the last several Wheel of Time books that Sanderson finished for the late Robert Jordon.  It was indeed an easy read, but the characters were all too shallow - to the point that some of the relationships failed to hit me with any emotional impact at the major turning points in the story (think Anakin/Padme here).  The best character in the book only has a few pages, as the main characters were really one dimensional.<br /><br />That being said, it was a really fun storyline where you will probably think you have the plot figured out, to find that were we a little right and a little wrong, but missed several obvious clues.  I'm a slow reader, but was able to finish this book in a few nights.  I will read the next book in the series (Firefight) when it comes out next fall.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|I was glad to get this book done before the film releases on the 27th. Great book on the sacrifice of US Armed Forces for this great country!
B003UAMWWQ|5.0|A classic sci-fi comedy. A tour de farce.  One of Mel Brooks' greatest movies. May the schwartz be with you!
B005K17RU0|4.0|I like the app though it occasionally tweaks my kindle and I need to reboot. Aside from this I find it relatively useful and am keeping it for now.
159562015X|5.0|I have used this with several Coaching clients and we all love it.  The Report it produces at the end (on line) which you can download always has a few surprises that define the person in a positive way.  Nothing negative about this process. It really helps when clients are trying to change careers or jobs and makes the resume production much easier.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|It was interesting to see a different interpretation of Emma.  I would highly recommend it to anyone who loves all things Jane Austen.  It made me think of different aspects of the book that I had not previously considered.
B00BTYP6QE|4.0|The game plays really well, however, it is very distracting when your score progress keeps popping up-- especially when it is the first time you are playing and every time you score any points, the app informs you that you have beaten the high score.
B0060V1WJ6|4.0|I liked the movie because I liked the actors and it was a cute story with no bad content. Very nice movie to watch anytime.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|it rocks you need to get this rate it after you will think it will be fun to run and let everything out
B000002IP1|5.0|I love this cd I play it all the time never was a big Phil Collins person and a friend told me to get it boy what a great purchase.
B00A2H9PLG|1.0|I saw Olympus Has Fallen and as I sat there watching the movie I had chills running down my spine and up my arms because of the destruction. It was amazing as a veteran to see the resolve in the heroes of that movie. However (dot dot dot), there is an imposter about. White House Down. I will be honest, I have not seen the movie. i will be honest again. I will never see the movie. I saw the trailers for this movie and they made me mad. That scene where Jaime Fox loses the bazooka and Tatum is like what, how do you lose a bazoka? Why add humor in a movie like this? Its called White House Down. I assume that the white house and innocent Americans inside and out... go down. Then I found out that the bad guys are right wing politicians. Can another movie seriously be more politicized? An African American President fighting to survive against the evil masterminds that are the Republicans? Sound familiar? To be fair if it was the opposite way around, I would still be just as mad. That's why I love OHF so much. It just doesn't go there. I don't even think you actually know which party the president of OHF actually represents. Please, save your money and instead go see Olympus Has Fallen. I promise you when that secret service agent is fighting for his life and whispers, &#34;Olympus has fallen&#34;, you will get that feeling. And we all know that feeling. That feeling that we are about to get served something fun and special.
B00CRS88IO|5.0|If you are looking for a tremendous amount of action this is the book for you. Ian Flemming is a God when he has to get out of stresful situations. The author keeps putting his character in difficult situations filled with tension and it's simply outstanding how he manages to get out from all of them. Amazingly written!
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|Very few films can touch the soul of the viewer. The acting, dialogue, and content of this film is superb to say the least. I was pleased that the film had adult subject matter, nudity, and adult content because the real subject's discussed were not necessarily meant for someone who is shy to such things. The story is about adversity, honor, truth, and above all the ability self criticize. It's a tale of leaving behind all the things that hold you back from truly living. Denzel Washington's' portrayal is nothing short of fantastic. His clear cut ability to show the true heart of addiction and the pain that comes along with it should speak to anyone who has dealt with struggle or loss. Writing, acting, action sequences all 5 stars. Worth the watch.... You can bet money on it ... or just pay for it!<br /><br />Don't go into this film thinking its a typical movie. There is nothing typical about it. From a true movie buff ... I would like to thank everyone who made this film possible for me watch.
B00B7NPRY8|5.0|This book has been reviewed more than 1,667 times on Amazon, 1998 of those are five star ratings. So you know it's a great book, but why it's great may escape you from the reviews I read. I bought the book having heard it's a classic, but knowing absolutely nothing about it, and the reviews I read didn't make me more inclined to read it. The author is obviously a genius, I mean a calculus and physics kind of genius, who figured out what the magnetic draw of a charismatic president could do to a country more than 60 years ago. He dropped hundreds of spectacular gems you probably never even considered before.  Things that could change the way you think about life. In addition, the story moves along more rapidly than most, and moves from step to step in a deeply coherent manner that was being set up for chapters but escaped your notice until it unfolded. Sometimes I was startled by the rapidness. All 900 pages of it. The other end of the universe from Stephenson or Mieville. This is the story of a 15 year old who suffered defeat and hid in the desert until he became the ultimate ruler and foundation of a new religion. Great plot, great characterization, great pace. Very little about the military stuff, a great deal about the other stuff. Great everything. Perhaps my favorite book. A fabulous read that will stick with you long after you put the book down.
B000I9WWCM|5.0|This is a Classic. Full of British comedy and romance. Hugh Grant's sensitivity and handsome awkwardness combined with Rhys Ifans' scene-stealing portrayal of Spike is truly outstanding. Wish there were more movies of this quality.

B005LAIIRQ|5.0|Excellent movie. Beautiful wolves! Wow I was not expecting the ending! It is the kind of movie you want to watch again. Another good one about wolves is &#34;Frozen&#34; ( not the Disney one). Super fast shipping!!!!
B009ZQFSRA|2.0|With multiple well know actors, including Christian Bale, I expected something better. It was a formula based science fiction that had pieces stolen from other movies; nothing very original and the acting was banal.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love it. My kids think it's great as well. They play it all the time. Can't get more gems currently. Not sure what the issue is.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|App needs work.<br />Music and look excellent but spending money on an app to get all ththe main characters is ridiculous. The mini game takes forever to to refresh each song and there are only three songs! Why make the game so hard to enjoy?<br />I also turn off the push notification for certain things but still get notifications. Another annoying thing is a push notification comes every few minutes. Takes up my battery.

B00GH4RKYM|4.0|The movie isn't perfect. Who the #$# cares?  It's Superman being superman, punching stuff, saving the world, great special effects and a bad super villian.  This is the movie I wanted to see when i was a kid.... not that lame crap featuring Christopher Reeve, but something that takes the character seriously and explores the fact that he is an invincible alien with human morals.  Not perfect but a great start.
0312360266|4.0|Young reader books or not I really enjoy the series. If you plan on reading a young reader book as an adult you need to have and keep an open mind. Yes some of the characters may be annoying.....they are teenagers....they are supposed to be annoying...If you annoyed then the writers succeeded in their quest. The story is not complex but again....it's not intended to be. Its intended for an immature audience.....

B00985E3UG|5.0|Any intelligent person abhors the idea of being manipulated. Then when you read this book and realize you're being manipulated by people who don't care that they are damaging your health and your children's health, it's infuriating! Add to this that they are doing this just to get rich and even the most conservative among us will call for government intervention. A most excellent book!
B005LW5J9O|5.0|This was a captivating book to read that brings together a lot of different threads through time and history to recount the story of On the Nature of Things - anyone interested in history, Humanism, manuscript traditions & cultural history in general will enjoy it. I had read the poem in a Latin class in grad school, but gained a much deeper appreciation for the survival of the poem into modernity through this book.
B007V65R54|4.0|This book is a must read for anyone interesting in forecasting. The examples are interesting, but maybe a bit over the top with regards to baseball.
B007R11DKQ|4.0|This was surprisingly good.  Just picked it because you can't go wrong with instant streaming.  I hadn't heard of this movie but after seeing it - found I liked it a lot.  It would be good for the whole family.  A little scary but not too gory and a nice romance.

B00FEMJF6O|1.0|I like the game when I could actually play the game. Every time I go to update the option doesn't show up. It seems that the developer is a bit of a sore loser not wanting to hear the opinions and criticism of anyone other than paying customers. I would think that all comments and ideas would be welcomed since it would give them more feed back about what customers look for. Right now I like playing when it works but, since it won't work it's not even worth buying.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|I really loved this game when I got it I played for 3 weeks until the game deleted itself and the saved data I got so mad I was at the 4 region!!!!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Ordered this with some reservation, however when it arrived, all that went away.  I bought this for a bedroom TV - as my smart TV is downstairs.<br /><br />the hookup was real, real simple - HDMI and USB on the TV - then downloaded the app for my iphone5 (you have to also download the google chrome app) - followed the steeps and BAM - next thing I know I was watching videos and netflix.

0316055433|5.0|O K Fine!  After her second book which I couldn't finish, I was wary.  I read the first book, The Secret History 4 or five times.  Hesitated over her third book.  Would she be able to do it again?<br />  I agree with Stephen King in his review of it in the New York times Book Review section, it is a wonder.  I'll read it again and again.  However, like Mr. King when he gets up a head of steam, she could use a careful editor.  I found myself skipping chunks of description.  Having said all that:  It is a must read.  I guess if you're that good (and she is) and you spend 10 years writing it, she gets to show off her research.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I have put off playing this game a long time even when my friends were playing but I finally tried it and ok you got me now! Highly addictive and such fun! I love it!
0525952926|5.0|I love epic novels and this is as exciting as the 1st of the series.  This great historical novel brings history to life.  Couldn't put it down until I finished.  Can't wait for the 3rd of the series.
B001TH16DI|5.0|All of these movies have their strengths, which cover any weaknesses, even the &#34;odd numbered&#34; films.  Without Star Trek Motion Picture (Star Trek 1), we would never have II and IV.  But 1 actually should be appreciated by fans of 2001 A Space Odyssey and Outland.

B0036TGSR6|5.0|This is a beautifully crafted film. Polanski is a master.  On the surface, it's about a Tony Blair-like British Prime Minister who  The movie was controversial because of the subject matter more than the story itself, which closely follows the great book, THE GHOST, by Robert Harris.  Having ghost-written numerous books for celebrities, the world-weary ghost-writer thinks he's seen it all. He knows how to turn a boring or sordid bio into a fascinating, inspiring bio. But as this story progresses, he begins to suspect he doesn't know the half of it. And in the end, what he uncovers tragically demonstrates his naiveté.  Author Harris uses various plot devices that serve to have the 'ghost' of the dead former ghost-writer guide the new ghost-writer along the trail that led to his mysterious death. The use of the SUV's GPS system to lead the ghost-writer to those responsible is pure brilliance. If it seems simple to some, it's nevertheless an effective allegorical device that carries the viewer ever deeper into the mystery.  The ending is sadly ironic, inexorable and prophetic, like a great allegories often are, and it's lesson is as wry as it is bitter.  In the hands of the great Roman Polanski, who gave us CHINATOWN, the film is as artful as it is captivating.
B00FWLDHSY|1.0|Monsters vs. Big Robots? YES. This movie? NO. I'm a huge nerd. I regretted not seeing this in the theaters. Now I don't. Sorry for not elaborating - but to elaborate more would mean...I don't know...just me wasting more time thinking about this movie.

I velcroed the band, painted the worn stripes with nail polish, and kept on wearing. It still keeps accurate time.<br /><br />Since I loved it so much, I simply ordered one just like it. I wear lots of color, so it complements my style. I love that it has a soft 'ticking&#34; sound even tho' its digital. Who wouldn't give it 5 stars!!!

1416594787|5.0|The subtitle is &#34;The Evidence for Evolution,&#34; but if that was all that was included, it wouldn't be very new or exciting. Indeed, Darwin himself did a sufficiently good job for his time, and his work has been added to for 150 years. This is different. A more accurate subtitle would be &#34;Arming rational people to debate with creationists.&#34; It's all here, in great detail, done for those of us who do not have much of a science background as well as for those who do.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>Chapter 1: Only a theory? There's nothing &#34;only&#34; about a real scientific theory. Dawkins explains very carefully the difference between the way a scientist uses the word &#34;theory&#34; and the way, for example, lawyers do.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>Chapter 2: Dogs, cows and cabbages. The ways in which artificial selection can help in understanding natural selection, particularly since humans have been breeding plants and animals for specific characteristics for a very long time.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>Chapter 3: The primrose path to macro-evolution. Other species besides humans have shaped the evolution of other species. How flowers are pollinated is a great example.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>Chapter 4: Silence and slow time. How fossils -- and even modern DNA -- can be dated. Several methods are described, which overlap one another and reinforce one another's conclusions.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>Chapter 5: Before our very eyes. Some evolution is remarkably quick, and therefore need not rely on fossil evidence.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>Chapter 6: Missing link? What do you mean, 'missing'? The very term &#34;missing link&#34; is nonsense, and Dawkins shows why. He makes the point that we don't really need the fossil record to prove evolution is real; it's just a bonus.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>Chapter 7: Missing persons? Missing no longer. The previous chapter specific to human evolution.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>Chapter 8: You did it yourself in nine months. The ways embryology tells us about many physical functions and developments, including evolution.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>Chapter 9: The ark of the continents. The way plate tectonics reinforces what we know of evolution. And evolution reinforces plate tectonics, too.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>Chapter 10: The tree of cousinship. It's not just fossils that can tell about our development. DNA marks how close any one modern species is to any other.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>Chapter 11: History written all over us. The ways in which earlier developmental stages are still evident in modern species; the design is far from intelligent.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>Chapter 12: Arms races and 'evolutionary theodicy'. As both predator and prey respond to their arms race to survive, there are limits where the trade-offs are no longer worthwhile.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>Chapter 13: There is grandeur in this view of life. Dawkins is quoting Darwin here, and expands on every sentence in the last paragraph of Origin of Species.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>An appendix is titled &#34;The history-deniers,&#34; and is more directly about those who seek to discredit evolutionary theory. There are also extensive notes, bibliography, suggestions for further reading, and index. There are also 32 pages of color photos which go a long way to illustrate the text, as well as any number of black-and-white illustrations.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>The style is conversational, often amusing, and especially good at putting clever asides in footnotes. Here's one of my favorites, after a reference to 'Peking Man':&lt;br/>&lt;br/>*Predictably, the Peking fossil is now sometimes called Beijing Man. Why, since we are talking English rather than Chinese, do we go along with 'Beijing' at all, when referring to China's capital?

If I were on it, I would say something like the following. We don't dab on a splash of Eau de Koln to drown out the smell of Mumbai Duck, or go waltzing to the strains of'the Blue Danaj' or 'Tales from the Wien Woods.' We don't compare Neville Chamberlain, the Man of Munchen, to Napoleon's retreat from Moskva. Nor yet (though give it time) do we take our snuffling little pet Beij for walkies.

The plot is executed amazingly and the actors employ subtle techniques that make you believe they that are actually physiologically experiencing their super powers. The movie was detailed, well written and without plot holes. Nolan makes super man feel like an actual multidimensional person,  similar to his amazing portrayal of batman. My only complaint is that they failed to make Lois Lane a brunette?!?! Why? it's so simple! Lois Lane just felt kind of absent. Like I was watching Amy Adams play herself. She was still good, she didn't feel like Lois. Small detail.  Really well done movie.  Ended up being better than I anticipated. Highly recommend.
B003XVYLDU|5.0|I gave this book, a five star rating just on the caliber of the story itself.  Vonnegut is at his best!
B003NFM3JU|5.0|\\"...There'll be scary ghost stories. And tales of the glories of Christmases long, long ago.\\"<br /><br />It seems a rather British tradition that Christmas time be accompanied by scary tales and ghost stories.  Some of that tradition has drifted over, and trickled down, to this side of the pond, here in the good ole US of A, and perhaps the most well-known incarnate manifestation of that tradition is in Charles Dicken's classic \\"A Christmas Carol\\" (the original title of which was \\"A Christmas Carol. In Prose. Being a Ghost Story of Christmas.\\") and its many adaptations on film and stage.  This particular adaptation of Robert Zemeckis' holds true to the scarier and darker aspects of the Dickensian story, probably more than any version I have ever seen.  Purists and fans of the book who appreciate British Christmas pastimes will probably love that part.  Idle American moviegoers thinking that it will be light, feel-good Disney fare will likely be a bit taken aback by it.<br /><br />I might as well get this out of the way -- is it the best adaptation of the story?  In my opinion, no.  The 1951 version [[ASIN:B008UY8FI2 A Christmas Carol (2012 release)]] starring Alastair Sim is the most moving and has the best character development.  You see so much more of Scrooge's backstory in that version -- more of his transition from being a warm, young idealist in love with a good woman to someone who fears the world too much and seeks emotional shelter in cold hard facts and becomes bent and hardened by them; the reasons of WHY he hated his nephew (Scrooge's sister, Fanny, died giving birth to Fred), why he often struggled with self-esteem and perhaps became reclusive (his father was unkind and didn't want him around, because he blamed Ebenezer for his mother's death, which of course wasn't his fault, just as Fanny's death wasn't Fred's fault),  -- and so we can empathize with Scrooge more; he becomes more human.  He becomes the best kind of villain, one in which we see our own darkness, fears, and shortcomings reflected in him.  This Disney version falls short of that beautiful backstory, and I struggled to give it five stars for these reasons (almost went with four), but it triumphs in other areas:<br /><br />First, of all, it's a Zemeckis film, and that means a solid, glorious production from start to finish.  The wintry scenes are so realistic and beautiful.  There are so many themes of a classic Zemeckis flick -- flying, time travel, and of course, the amazing music composed by Alan Silvestri, which also includes some BEAUTIFUL, elegant, soaring arrangements of some traditional Christmas hymns.<br /><br />Second, the three ghosts are marvelous, all played by Jim Carrey, which is to me a symbolic self-projection of Scrooge's past, present, and (tentative) future Christmases.  The Ghost of Christmas past, especially, is bar none, the most creative and artistic interpretation of that timeless, mysterious character.  If you have not seen it, I don't want to spoil it -- but the effect of that character for me, was reciprocal of the form and shape he takes -- \\"luciferous\\", in the best, most angelic sense possible.<br /><br />The animation is superb. The 19th century London-era conditions and Christmas decorations are invitingly real.  Scrooge's harsh features and coldness of personalty are well-depicted, as are the youthful joys he later displays, post-redemption.  The animation is of course, more advanced than Zemeckis' earlier \\"Polar Express\\".<br /><br />All in all, though not the best adaptation in my opinion, it's still a great movie, a great escape into Dickens and beautiful Christmas artistry.  For those who enjoyed the ghostly British traditions of this version, and would like to see something similar, I'd recommend the first episode of the second season of \\"Lark Rise to Candleford\\" [[ASIN:B0042UIQYG Episode 1 [HD]]]. (I always like to include similar products in my reviews for those who share my same interests, and hope you find that helpful.)at helpful.)

B00B5HQLMI|4.0|I thought it was a thrilling movie. Non-stop action, but still can't get used to Daniel Craig as Agent 007.
B003BLPTB0|5.0|I purchased my first pair of Crocs 2 years ago and really enjoyed them, however after wearing them a while I wore off the tread on the bottom of the Crocs. This new pair of Crocs feels and fits differently. I find the new pair are less bulky on the outside, and fit more snugly on my feet. After putting these new Crocs on, I did not want to take them off. This new pair has improved rubber that really give my feet extra support and are amazingly comfortable as well! I liked my old Crocs that I had before, but the new ones I LOVE! Rarely do I ever find a shoe that is this comfortable right out of the box.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|Breaking Bad - thrilling, engrossing, one of the best tv shows ever. Once you get on board with Walter White and Jessie Pinkman you can't let go until you see where their story leads and how it ends. Excellent.
B0089LOG02|4.0|Good story and well written.<br /><br /> Have read several books about the Orphan Trains and this is close to the facts as they are known.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My 6 yr old son loves this game. Whenever we are doing something that requires waiting my son always asks for this game. He absolutely LOVES it.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Grisham is a fantastic storyteller.  His forte is, of course, the justice system.  This novel builds on his first novel, A Time To Kill.  It is definitely one of those novels you just can't put down and about which you are sad when done that it is finished.  I await Grisham novels with bated breath.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This is a good game. It's point and click, with hidden objects. Good graphics and storyline. The theme is creepy.
0316055433|5.0|Another masterpiece from Donna Tartt.  She paints with a fine brush and she never disappoints.<br />This book was  worth waiting for.
