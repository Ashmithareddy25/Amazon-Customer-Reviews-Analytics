B007FH9GT2|5.0|I was hesitant to watch this movie. The darkness of the movie is what makes it amazing though! Definitely a must see.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|very fun..I like all the games that are on it. sometimes boring though because you have to unlock new games with points you earn..
B004T2QZL8|2.0|Crashes on my droid X2. Just like the other reviews - force closes after 24 combos.  At least it was free. Guess you get what you pay for.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|EDIT:  As I promised, I changing my review since the developer patched the app and fixed the FC issue.  I would have given it 4 stars but they earned the 5th one by responding so quickly to the customers.  I have neverbefore seen a dev send out a major update on Amazon within 24 hours of being FAOTD. Thanks for being responsible devs.<br /><br />________________________________________________________<br />I loved it until the force close started happening.  I got about 35 elements created and now it FC every time I open the game.  Too bad, it was fun while it lasted.  I will gladly change my reading of the issue is fixed but I don't hold much hope for that since this a FAOTD and must devs abandon the app once it gets featured.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|it okay. it free so why not? great waist of time. games a fine. I am only doing this for coins on this game.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|was really fun to start with. but after a few levels it froze up and kicks me out. it's sad..cause I really liked playing.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This was the best book I have read in a long time. Finished it in less than 2 days! I highly recommend it. The characters are compelling and complex and flawed, like the rest of us.
B006PHD0RW|4.0|This is a cute puzzle game with a neat premise, and probably the only way bagging groceries could ever be fun.  The goal is to fit all of the groceries into the bag, but you have only limited control over the order.  In addition to making everything fit, you're also encouraged to avoid squishing items or packing them in such a way that the contents shift when the bag is picked up.  The graphics are nice, the touch controls are intuitive, and the optional goals make it worthwhile to replay levels without being frustrating.  Works great on the Kindle Fire.
B004T2QZL8|3.0|Worked fine for 3 uses and about 40 combos then started the force close thing. Fun app, much like alchemy. You can tell it's Russian made when one of the first 5 combos is vodka.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|This game works fine on my Kindle Fire.  I've had no issues with freezing or force quitting.<br /><br />This is a spin on your typical 'alchemy' game, in which you combine 'elements' to form new combinations.  On the downside, there's a story that you can't seem to skip which takes a few minutes to play when you start a game or make enough progress.  On the upside, you get a quip or quotation every time you make a successful combination, and some of these are quite amusing.  There's also a log of successful combinations and a great hint system which you an use once a minute to either tell you a goal to aim for or narrow down potential combinations.
B0063IH60K|4.0|the game is good but could be way better than it is! so if u do get it just be shire u know its an ok game not the best that's why I gave it 4 stars.
B004T2QZL8|2.0|i enjoyed playing until the force close began....hope you fix it soon so I can enjoy this game some more
B000JMLFLW|4.0|Romantic.  I started wishing i had lived during that time.  This book started my fascination with the classics.  Now, i cant stop reading them.
0307887960|4.0|I am 54 years old and I am 5 foot tall and weighed in at 145 pounds. Let's just say I was too big for my britches. I have yoyo dieted for the last 15-18 years. I would lose 5 pounds and gain it right back. I decided it was time to get serious about losing weight because my health was suffering from the extra weight. My cholesterol was getting too high, my blood pressure was getting higher and my knees were really bothering now due to the extra weight (and age) I am sure was a factor. I was also borderline diabetic as Well. I needed to do something now. I read the review about this book and thought this is the right life-style change for me. I got started as soon as got the book. I lost 10 pounds in 10 days. The next 2 weeks I lost 5 more. I have now gone down 3 pants sizes. Ya-hoo! This diet works for me. I have only 5 more pounds to go to get to my initial goal of 125 pounds. I will then reevaluate to see if I should lose 10 pounds more. I do like that I don't feel like I'm starving either. So far so good. I'm very impressed.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|great game with a little something extra with the story line to follow makes the time go by and keeps me entertained
1612130283|3.0|Either I'm really perverted or this wasn't as erotic as everyone is making it out to be. Sex scenes are graphic, yes, but not any more so than the average romance novel.
B006TXDOZ0|5.0|Best album of the year so far, ingredients: little bit of Jack White / Smashing Pumkins / Led Zeppelin / Beatles - fresh new sounds, strong brew, great guitar-sound.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|This has not had any problems with my kindle fire. It works great, and I know how it works, since I played it on addictinggames.com. It's a really fun game that requires creativity, imagination, and the knowledge it doesn't mess up. I AM ADDICTED. I usually play the Story games while talking to my best friend  on the phone, but yesterday I was playing Doodle God. Five stars, for the world! *****
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Excellent book....can't wait for movie!<br />Book is a great addition to my Nicholas Sparks collection.  It just might be one of my favorites.
B002RHGYOA|5.0|This book kept me from household chores - and getting the required amount of sleep. I really enjoyed the read. Being of Australian origin it took a little while for me to get to know the characters as the foreign names and places did not stick in my head. Once I became engrossed in the story this was not a problem. Intriguing plot with unpredictable outcomes kept me interested. I would highly recommend this book.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love these games and it is really fun to play with I would highly recommend this game to people.
B0063IH60K|3.0|challenging and fun. its your typical solitaire game. i enjoy the challenge of a difficult puzzle so this game is fun but can certainlybecome boring after a bit.
B0064MT1QW|4.0|I like this movie. Winning 9 academy award .. transfer picture very good and audio DTS HD 5.1 very well. A lot of Feature in standart Definition. and i hope the English Patient NOT release agaian with different Feature in High Definition . And I didn't have a slipcase with this edition
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is the best it is so awesome here has I am just ddoooo nshjsjhsh jkz awesome loving it. catch u later
B001NHNG64|4.0|The antagonists soon learn that Jack Reacher is the wrong guy to take on a trip against his will. The odds against Jack may be overwhelming but he does not back down.<br />If you sometimes feel like you are slugging it out against an enemy that is overwhelming and does not fight fair,you will have satisfaction in reading and identifying with the Lee Child hero.
B004T2QZL8|2.0|Like others that have reviewed, I thought I'd give this a whirl, too. Worked ok for about 45 elements, then, boom! Force close. Now every time I choose an element combination that doesn't make anything, it force closes again. It was fun before all the force closes. Very similar to alchemy, but elements seem to stay better organized. Hoping for an update/bug fix soon...
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I purchased the Marware cover for my Kindle Fire and was impressed with the quality and functionality of it.  I really like the way the stand works.  When I read in bed, my Kindle would get heavy, but with the stand, I can rest it on me, propped up with the stand, and read comfortably.
B0055AUS8O|5.0|I wanted to upgrade my boat shoes. I have been using a fairly inexpensive pair of Columbia sandals but I had 2 complaints.<br /><br />1)First of all was the comfort or lack there of. I broke my heel about 12 years ago & still have constant discomfort. Any sandal that I have worn is worse than a good pair of sneakers. I decided to step up & spend a little more money & try out Teva. WOW am I glad I did. I can't believe the comfort of these sandals. I have been wearing them around the house & working outside or in the garage for about a week now & they are absolutely great.<br /><br />2)The second problem with my old pair is that they acted like a sponge. Once they became wet, they stayed wet for hours which I really hate. I have not tried these Teva's out yet but from what I can see, they will be much better, time will tell.<br /><br />I am very glad I decided to purchase these Teva's. The comfort alone is unbelievable & they will get a lot of time once the Spring/Summer arrive & stay.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|This little thing mad my sony mdr-xb 500s sound 3 times as bassy and loud. it is incredible how good my headphones sound now. i highly recommend this for any kind of bass headphones.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I got the force close bug, but the game was fun until that point. Currently downloading the update. There is no reason to give this 1 star.
B002XTXG1G|4.0|Just stumbled on this movie out of the blue. I absolutely loved it. It is so entertaining and funny. It was<br />not what I suspected. Tom Hardy is so over the top and superbly brillant! This is a must see movie!
B004EBUXI0|5.0|Wonderful cpu. No problems to speak of and works just as intended.<br />Can't say anything for the included heat sink since I use a coolermaster instead.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|This is a great game and I highly recommend this game. If you don't buy this game it is your loss.
B004WPYNY8|5.0|One of the reasons I love Symphony X so much is that they are an incredibly dynamic band. They manage to deliver awesome music with every new album. They have a perfect balance...you can always tell that their songs are theirs, but not every album sounds the same. They are constantly trying new styles and throwing different twists into their music. Some fans complain that it doesn't sound enough live a certain previous album that was released, but honestly, if all their music was going to sound the same, why bother making more than one album? They are an ever-evolving progressive metal group and they have something to offer almost every metal fan throughout their very successful career and they have yet to release an album that I dislike.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this game!  I like how it plays in both portrait and landscape views on my Kindle Fire.  I also like how if I have a bad day, I can deal a &quot;winning hand&quot;!  :)
B004EPYZSK|5.0|This movie was way better then I expected after reading the way the \\"reviewers\\" more or less slamed it.  I enjoyed it very much and it is definately worth repeat viewings--only wish I would have seen it on the big screen but I should know better then to listen to the people who review this kind of movie as they are not sci-fi fans (at least concerning this flick).  Great acting by Harrison Ford & Daniel Craig as well as the entire cast.  With a title like \\"Cowboys & Aliens\\", you know that this movie is going to be \\"FUN\\". Pure Entertainment with great special effects (Aliens are awesome--from Stan Winston's company) and it also contains emotional scenes that are believable. Not to be missed--you will not be disappointed!! Again, Harrison Ford & Danial Craig are great and look like they had a fun time making this movie.
B005URRCUY|5.0|This has to be one of the most interesting records I've ever heard. For starters The Black Keys are in no way charting new territory here, I feel like I've heard these songs before. This album is like Exile on Main Street in the sense that it is not pushing any boundaries or exploring new avenues. What they both have in common though is that they are perfecting what came before. El Camino is one of the most energetic and consistent albums I've ever heard. You can clearly hear the influences in this record but the songs are performed with such bravado that you could swear the Black Keys were the ones influencing everyone else.<br /><br />Everything about El Camino is worth hearing. The energy, the confidence and tight playing makes this one worth every penny.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|This is a lot of fun now that they've updated and fixed the problem. It's a very big game I think, since I've been playing for hours and haven't even finished the first of four chapters.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really like this game. it is hard though. but it awesome. the only thing I hate about this game is that you have to earn stars to get games.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Stabbing sushi has me hooked.  Some of the games aren't for me, but there's enough that are.  I open more everyday.  Fun!
B006TXDOZ0|5.0|2012's Sweet Sour follows 2009's [[ASIN:B002AKAM38 Baby Darling Doll Face Honey]], a strong debut that showcased the Band of Skulls' talents, and ultimately their capabilities and potential, quite nicely. So the question is would the Band of Skulls stay on par with BDDFH, exceed the bar and set a *new* standard, or fall short?<br /><br />In my opinion, they did all three. And here's why.<br /><br />First, why this album stayed on par with their debut. These songs maintain the strengths the trio displayed at first. Russell Marsden's and Emma Richardson's great individual voices and even better harmonious duets (for lack of a better word) still blow me away, as though the two were born to sing together. They are harmoniously distinct, as in they sound incredible together but the listener can still pick out the nuances of each. Really, every track is an excellent example of this.<br /><br />Then there's the great guitar tone and effects... throughout. Enough said there.<br /><br />The creative timing and tempo methods and changes keep you on your toes without making you feel lost within the song (think how mentally exhausted you get when you hear Rush and contrast that with how smooth Pink Floyd switches between time signatures and/or tempos... Band of Skulls maintains that smoothness). This is often thanks to Matthew Hayward's silky smooth and incredibly precise drum tracks. Wanderluster has excellent execution of the 7-beat measures but then seamlessly flows into a more normal 8-beat format.<br /><br />And the \\"rock-your-head\\" factor... definitely maintained that. Listen to Lies or You're Not Pretty But You Got It Goin' On and just *try* not rock out. Yeah, thought so...<br /><br />Second, why this album set a higher standard than previously set by BDDFH. This album maintains a slightly slower feel than their debut. This displays their depth, their ability to make great rock songs without feeling the need to play obnoxiously fast and shred out a solo every 30 seconds(not that they did that on BDDFH, just that other bands feel that's what makes them \\"cool\\"). Tracks like Lay My Head Down (with the segment of pure and sweet instrumental controlled chaos), and Navigate (with the haunting instrumentation slowly yet powerfully driving the track) prove you don't have to play a mile-a-minute to make a great song.<br /><br />Third, however, this same slower pace is also why I feel they fell short of the bar BDDFH set (though only by a tiny bit). Tracks like Hometowns and Close to Nowhere are good slow songs with great dual vocals and nice guitar tone. But they seem to drag just a tad. I hate to say that because I really do love Band of Skulls, and the fact that these songs are slower (Close to Nowhere being *significantly* slower) isn't necessarily a bad thing. I mean, Close to Nowhere is the album closer. It's allowed to be slow. But when you compare that with BDDFH's final track \\"Cold Fame,\\" you see the difference.<br /><br />So if you were looking for more of a driving album in imitation of BDDFH, then you *may* be a little disappointed. But if you look at the album as a whole, you'll find that really the sound Band of Skulls established on their debut has not been lost. It's simply matured. And, in more ways than one, that's a *very* good thing.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|I played for a day then started playing this morning played for 10 mins. then it started force closing. Needs updating!!!!
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I loved this book. I just finished it and I swear I didn't want it to end. I fell in love with Travis and his bad boy antics. And Pigeon with her mysterious background. It was exciting to go through all of their ups and downs along with them. They are made for each other! I hope the author writes more compelling books like this one!
B004T2QZL8|5.0|now that the force close issue is fixed the game continues to go on with more combinations and now it doesn't lag
B005Q1W10A|3.0|I purchased this DVD of Downton Abbey Season 2 (Original U.K. Unedited Edition) only one month ago, in mid February. I love love love the show and the dvd works great, but I just came across it again for sale on Amazon and noticed that it now comes with the option to buy the dvd and watch it instantly, which was not available when I first bought it. The instant download came with my first season so it would have been nice to have the same option for my second season. I hate when I find a great product only to be discover it's upgraded version the next month...
B005IA9K2G|5.0|This is one of our favorite movies, which we viewed for years as a video tape.  We were delighted that this show was available through amazon.com at a reasonable price.  We are looking forward to viewing \\"Meet Me in St. Louis\\" again in this more modern format.
B0065GC0BA|4.0|At the beginning of this book, I thought I had it all worked out, however it proved me wrong.<br />I think it is brilliantly written, entertaining and emotionally challenging at times.
0545403359|3.0|I really enjoyed the movie, but I can barely tell how it came from this book. Some of the characters & situations were similar. Oddly, there was far more character development in the movie. The book is told from the point of view of the horse, so it might make sense that there was not much emotional depth, but it just felt dry.<br /><br />I don't recommend the book. I do recommend the movie.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I was surprised at how much I liked this book.  The characters were well-drawn and witty.  Although I am not a cancer survivor, my best friend died of cancer at a young age, so this book was particularly sad for me.  You might need some tissues.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a great app. it is really fun. I would totally recommend it to my friends with kindle fires
B005HSG3TC|5.0|Its just as advertised, lightweight, durable, and the kindle fire sits perfectly inside. The viewing stand is also very sturdy.
B00466HN6S|5.0|Our family saw this movie in the theater last year ON Easter Sunday afternoon, and we enjoyed it so much!!  Placing my Pre-order today for the DVD so we can enjoy it again during this year's Easter Season!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|fun games to play and really easy to earn more points for new games! definitely worth the download!  so so easy to play!
B004T2QZL8|1.0|Doodle God Force Closes after about 30 minutes of game play when the player gets to 32-33 elements and 8-9 groups.  I cleared data and played again and the same error popped up after prolonged play. Powering off and on does not resolve the issue. Once the game is started and the next move is made, it force closes.<br />Really like the concept and game play but a game that can't be finished due to Force Close issues has to be rated 1 Star.
B004T2QZL8|3.0|force close has led me to this opinion. I really enjoy it but when it force closes its really aggravating
B0058VW36U|4.0|what are y'all doing hi get cut the rope ha ha ha ha ha ha ha it's so so so fun you need to get it y'all come on. y'all you are so so happy y'all Miranda out bye girls and boy.
0307474712|2.0|I was actually pleased to see a few negative reviews because I thought there might be something 'wrong' with me for not liking this book.  Most people love it (or those who find it interesting enough to pick up, usually love it) but I somehow fell out of the norm.  I found the story slow and after a few re-starts gave up.  I never bonded with Emma, who I think I was supposed to relate to.  Really?  I don't think so.  Mainly, it was Dex's self-centeredness that caused me to give up.  I found extremely frustrating. Yes, he's flawed and there are people like this in society, but I'm sorry I don't find it adorable.<br />I've read long novels in the past where I wasn't completely wrapped up in the characters, but the plot was such that I had to keep turning the pages--I just had to find out happens at the end.  I have to assume that Dex and Emma make their way to each other at the end, but I can't see why.  Or, more truthfully, I no longer care why.  Recommendation: Proceed with caution.
B007M6P01O|4.0|The finale went off good. Rick finally grew a pair and blew off some pent up steam toward the group and their complacency with Shane and his wife.<br />Not too sure about the whole comic book direction it appears to be going in, but after all it was a series and it has to stay true to it.<br />I think the farm being overrun was a wake up call that they needed, the world they live in is not something they can sit back and forget about. The season did follow a soap opera type story line, but for what its worth, making an attempt get back to a normal life is really what these people wanted to do. Understandably there were some issues with AMC on money and everything else, and slowing things down was what they were really trying to do until things got squared away. But, looking at things from a realistic point of view, these are normal everyday people who had their world completely changed by something that they still don't understand. They are not highly trained military personnel who are skilled in fortification and survival techniques, everybody would kind of assume fencing would be adequate to keep a hand full of walkers out. The last thing that they thought about was a stampede. They are still learning as they go. I mean come on, look at Dale, the guy looked like he just came off vacation in his RV and the world went to hell on him. People don't naturally run around on survival instincts until something immediate confronts them, such as a lone walker walking around. These people just wanted to get back to what they knew as a normal life, to include relationship problems, which is an everyday \\"normal\\" occurrence. After a traumatic experience like the whole world turning into monsters, people need normalcy. They are not going to go out searching for more danger.<br />So there was a sense of reality in Season 2, despite how irritating things got for some. It really did at times seem like they were away from the real bad world, achieving what they were looking for, butno matter how hard they try, they keep learning just how hard it really is in the world now.....
B0054JZC6E|3.0|the game was ok, i think it could have been better. some of the games i didn't understand. it was ok.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I don't listen to reviews too often, so I didn't much care that everyone was having issues. For some reason I rarely have any of the problems others talk about. I did with this one however. Force closes around 30 matches in. I enjoyed the game until that point so I was going to give 3 stars. However, when I got here, there was an update available, so I thought I'd give it a shot. The update fixed the force closures. So 5 stars for a fun game and fixing issues!
B004T2QZL8|5.0|The latest update has fixed the force-close issue for me.  I'm enjoying the punny combinations again.  Thanks for the excellent customer service.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Love the whole trilogy.  Read all three in one week! I wish there were more books in the series.
0345529057|1.0|I really like the books.  The Reading is 5 Star.<br />The soft cover books however are very cheaply constructed.  The books have been read twice each and look like books from a library that have been read by hundreds of people.  Cost cutting gone too far.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I first heard about this series on the Today show.  I figured if it caused such a stir, I gotta read it!  I flew threw all three books in the series in a week. Fifty Shades Freed was my favorite of the three.  My only complaint is that, I want more!!!
B002JCSWVG|5.0|Even if you don't like sports flicks this one is a MUST have.<br /><br />Nelson Mandela is a remarkable man.<br /><br />Forgiveness is one of the hardest, if not impossible, virtues to attain and master.<br /><br />massive flick.  Slept on, sadly, but massive never-the-less.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|Excellent and entertaining until force close issue. Update fixed that issue and on the same day as the Amazon app of the day no less. I would recommend to anyone to buy.
B004T2QZL8|2.0|I got so far in this game then it started fcing on me. Its a good game ,but it won't work now.
B0055S348W|5.0|I got this on the faotd a while back and I have never had any problems with it I use a bluetooth printer and prints every time
0439023483|5.0|This book is great for teenagers and adults alike. For anyone who has read Harry Potter Books, or the Twilight series...this is a MUST READ.
B005PK1G76|5.0|I bought this drink holder to go on my Peg Perego Pliko stroller. The velcro straps are very generous in length so it fits perfectly on my stroller. It is not flimsy and holds drinks well. Also love larger pocket for wallet and zippered compartment for keys . Very pleased with purchase.
B001DF68MA|3.0|We just got this from UPS less then 5 mins ago. We were so excited.  Opened the package and my husband and I looked at each other and knew it wouldn't fit our son.  But just in case we put him in it (in the kitchen with hubby holding the back) there is no way! My son is 1 1/2 but he is tall and skinny.  He is just over 23 lbs. He is just too tall.  We are going to have to return it.  It would fit our neighbors kid just great, she wears size 6-12 month old clothing.  LOVE the concept, it just wont work with our kid.  Nicely built.
B0026MOVO6|5.0|I didn't really appreciate Whitney Houston until her death.  Her music touched me as I was going through lots of drama.....It was awesome to hear her sing my problems away.  I love Whitney!!!!!!
B004ZNAXX2|5.0|Immersion Box Set The Wall is amazing, all the products are excellent for a collector like me. I recommend it for anyone wishing to buy
B004MC8CA2|5.0|great Bible....my only wish is that I could use it offline too.I use it with my kindle fire and it works nice.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love thew holy Bible. everyone should have it. praise the lord.  love God and Jesus. this is the best book in the world
B004T2QZL8|1.0|This could've been a good game but the &quot;force close&quot; bug is causing this game to be unplayable. All we want is for an update to fix the bug. Please fix this asap so I can start playing again and at the same time rate this game a 5 star.
1401937519|5.0|Thank you Anita for sharing your incredible story.  I has created a shift within me to see all aspects of my self through love.  I am inspired to follow my true calling and passion in life now, realizing that I AM worthy of an incredible, amazing, loving life.  I have this I-Book on my I-phone so I can re-read parts of it daily!  I will be buying this book for many family and friends... Many blessings
0810989956|5.0|I have had the hardest time getting my son to read and he loves this book!! It's not the same as reading a chapter book but he stsill has to read to work the problems.
B003IKMR0U|4.0|Got the game in today, everything is there and in excellent condition.  Only issue was the caps that came off too easily, both top and bottom.  The bottom cap (without the tab at the top to help get it open) came off easier, so with a little super glue I was able to get it to stick in place just fine.  :P  Very fun and portable game to play with friends if you have some time to spare.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I have played Alchemy in the past and loved it. However, overall, I enjoy this game much better. The interface is much cleaner, and<br />the art is much more interesting, with each element having its own style simultaneously unique and cohesive. My only complaint is that there does not seem to be any indication when a terminal element (one that cannot be combined with any other element to create a new element ) has been discovered. However, this may be an intentional design choice to keep the player guessing. There is also the possibility that I have not yet created a terminal element, but that seems unlikely.<br /><br />I have seen many reviews complaining about a force close issue. I have not experienced this issue at all. I am up to 60+ elements and the game continues to run smoothly. I am using a Motorola Razr.
B004T2QZL8|2.0|This game is really fun when it isn't force closing every time I open it. Will give 5 stars once they update it to fix this extremely annoying bug
B004T2QZL8|3.0|the game itself has a really fun objective but once I hit a certain point, it kept force closing. I'm sure the devs will patch it up. the game is good, but this problem is a huge setback.
B001NLKT60|5.0|This first book was awesome.  I am currently reading the second.  It's a very easy read about a mature subject.  I enjoyed it thoroughly.
B005M2A4D4|4.0|Others have listed and reviewed the content on the discs.  I am disappointed that there is commentary on less than half the episodes, but I don't really buy the disc sets for the extras.  I wanted to complete my set of the 'new' \\"Doctor Who\\" series, even though I thought Series Six was weak in several spots compared to Series Five and the Russell T Davies episodes.<br /><br />With this particular set, I am very disappointed with the quality of the packaging.  Upon arrival, I discovered that the middle spindles of the disc trays were broken out of the first four of the six discs.  The first tray is also cracked from the corner into the center in two spots.  This is probably because, compared to the Series Five set, the plastic used is thin and cheap.  The case enveloping it also seems to be made of cheaper stock, and shows a clear and permanent crease in the spine.<br /><br />Unfortunately, since I live in Mexico, returning them to Amazon for a replacement that is not torn up would cost a lot more than just buying a new set.  I wish they'd just charged a little more and not used cheap and inferior materials for the packaging.

B004DMIIVO|5.0|I was a bit skeptical when I came across this movie at first; I had never heard of it before, and I'm always reluctant to invest money into media that I'm not 100% sure is something that I'm going to enjoy. However, the trailer, art, and story really interested me, and I decided to give it a shot. Man, am I glad that I did! This film has it all: action, comedy, and a heartfelt story of family and its bond through any strife. The animation is, of course, phenomenal; the style of the world of OZ is vivid and eye-catching - Ii would expect no less from Madhouse. If you're still trying to decide whether or not to buy this movie, I can assure you that you should watch this. It's a blast.
B005MMJ84K|3.0|Have you ever had a love-hate relationship with a story? I've had that experience with several books in the past (The Host by Stephenie Meyer and The Lovely Bones by Alice Sebold to name a couple), and, unfortunately, this book falls into that category for me. Pandemonium is the second book in the \\"Delirium\\" trilogy by Lauren Oliver. I was so blown away by the first book (as you can read in my previous review) that I was both excited and worried about reading this one - excited to continue along in the heart-in-your-throat, gut-wrenching story that was presented in the first book, but worried that it would never measure up. Well, the tally is in...and here's how it looks.<br /><br />Aesthetics<br />The cover art is beautiful, hands down. I would argue, though, whether or not it actually communicates anything about the plot of the story. The title is perfect for the overall tone of the book and carries over nicely from the ending of the first installment in this trilogy, reminding the reader with a simple word of all the emotions evoked by the Delirium experience.<br /><br />Plot<br />Sometimes, as readers, we want the story to go the way we expect. Some of us even feel a need for the story to go that way, as if during the course of the book we've formed relationships with the characters and want to see them prosper, triumph, achieve a form of happiness no matter how dire the situation...etc. Other times, however, I find myself wishing that I hadn't come up with the ending, or at least, in this case, the next path that the author would take. I wanted Oliver to wow me with this book, to take her characters to a level I'd never imagined, to blow my mind as she did in the first book. Hell, I would've been okay with the extreme disappointment that I felt after reading Mockingjay (the last in trilogy of The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins), just so that the experience would have been raw and new. I'm sorry to say that it didn't happen - no sorrow, no shock, not even disappointment. If I had to describe this book in one word, I would use predictable, and I'm so sad about that fact that I don't know if I'll read the third book. There's a large part of me that wishes that I'd stuck to the gut feeling that I should have stopped with book one. When I say I have a love-hate relationship with this book...you guessed it. It's (very unfortunately) the plot that I \\"hate.\\" Don't get me wrong, though...I enjoyed the read. I think my expectations were extraordinarily high because the first book moved me so much. I'm hoping that this book suffers from \\"middle book\\" syndrome, and that the last installment will wrap things up for me in a way that makes me fall in love with the story all over again.<br /><br />Overall Readability<br />I've said it before and I'll say it again, Oliver is a master of words. Despite the predictability of plot, I loved the writing. It's truly beautiful. I wish it was enough to save the story. However, the book is written in a series of \\"then\\" and \\"now\\" chapters, and I wish it had just been written as a sequential series of events. The flashbacks made the story seem choppy, and since the first book wasn't written this way, it serves to further break apart the two instead of allowing them to flow nicely together.<br /><br />Recommendation<br />If you read Delirium and loved it, you're going to be very tempted to read this book. At the end of the day, I know I'll read the entire trilogy, if not for any other reason but that I simply have to finish, to allow the author to play out the story and to give her one last chance to wow me again like she did in book one. That being said, my recommendation on this one will be \\"give it a chance,\\" because there is still great potential in the trilogy as a whole.<br /><br />If you do decide to read, be sure to pick up Hana - A Delirium Story and read that first. This is a super short, easy read written from Hana's (the main character's best friend) perspective. I mentioned before thatOliver has not just created a story but an entire world, and this novella only serves to expand that world for the reader. I love when authors do this, and I think you'll find that it will enrich the reading experience of this trilogy as a whole if you take part in this \\"bridge\\" story, too.Oliver has not just created a story but an entire world, and this novella only serves to expand that world for the reader.

0132350882|3.0|There are authors that suit you and there are authors that don't. Having spent a decent amount of time to get through Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship, I have found out, that Mr. Martin fails to suit me. His self admiration and belief that he is new software messiah (and as such, cannot be mistaken) is intolerable to the extent, when I literally had to convince myself from chapter to chapter to read the book until bitter and inconclusive end.<br /><br />The book itself decently represents principles of clean coding. Most of it known to me, I still enjoyed refreshing my previous knowledge and add new one. However, one cannot surpass the feeling that the only reason this book exists is for author to prove he is better than everyone else. This feeling is such, that you will want to throw the book out of the window at half point. I advise you not to do it as you will miss a lot of good stuff, but simply skip authors self-promotion (which takes about one third of a book).<br /><br />I recommend this book to eight graders that know how to code an application, but want to learn more about principles of clean coding. Take it as another guideline and you will learn a lot. Take it as a rule and you will get yourself banging your head against the wall.
B007B6T3K4|5.0|I have to agree with the majority, here. The new Xandria is wonderful. Yes, the vocalist sounds very much like Tarja but their sound is different than that of the old Nightwish. It differs from the old Xandria, too. It's heavier for one thing and has more symphonic grandeur, but you can still hear similarities in many of the tracks. Some tracks are fairly melodic. Track 14, for example, The Sailor and the Sea, reminds me of Blackmore's Night. There is not a weak track in the bunch, though. This is a new band and it is great. I highly recommend this to all those who like female fronted symphonic metal bands such as Nightwish, Wildpath, Epica, Amberian Dawn, and others.

B007704HO6|5.0|I read this book in one night and loved it.  I went to Youtube and watched the videos.  It is an uplifting tale of a former drug addict and the cat that changed his life.  I know, I know, corny as it can get but it doesn't come across as corny.  You see the challenges he faces as a former drug addict, as a street musician and the cruelty and kindness of the people he encounters in the streets.  All through his story, he also tells of the care and love he gives Bob.  You also see Bob caring and loving James.  It is uplifting and I hope I hear more happy tales from these 2.

I wish DLR would try to sing in his range though, it hurts to listen to him reach for the high notes. The early reviews were right, this is a mis-mash of old songs that have been rehashed. You can guess what sessions these songs came from.....anyway it's nice to hear the band running on all cylinders, and the You Tube footage has been great....what the F took so long???????

To be honest, the game isn't even all that fun. Just trying to combine elements to make more stuff, I thought maybe there'd be more of a challenge.

B003Y5H5HO|4.0|\\"I want you to help me catch a killer of women.\\" Disgraced journalist Mikael Blomqvist (Craig) is asked by a man named Henrik Vanger (Plummer) to find his nieces killer who committed the crime 40 years ago. He receives help from the eccentric Lisbeth Salander (Mara) who has her own motives. I had contradicting feelings going into this one. I really loved the original (I haven't read any of the books though) but I was worried about how this one would be but was very excited to see it. I though the casting was perfect but the original Lisbeth was so tremendous that I couldn't see how this could be as good. One of the first things I noticed was how similar Mara looked to the original actress. As the movie went on I started seeing more and more similarities to the original. I realize that this is based off a book so they will be similar but this to me felt like almost a shot for shot remake. It's been a while since I saw the original but it felt like almost the exact same thing. All that said though the original seemed better to me, I don't know what this was missing but I don't think it was as good. I did like this movie though. Overall, not as good as original but very close. I give it a B.

1614270198|5.0|I read this book in the late 1980s when my life had reached an impasse and I had no idea where to turn.  To get the full effect, one should really read and re-read it daily.

1400032717|5.0|As a teacher for \\"exceptional\\" children I recognize all of Christopher Boone's traits; phobias, aversion to physical contact, fascination with patterns, dislike for crowds and noises, and in common with many such kids, aversion to the color yellow. I don't know why so many challenged kids have an aversion to yellow, but for some cockamamie reason, they do.<br /><br />The book starts with Chris' neighbor's dog being killed, and he sets out to find who did it. He finds out, but along the way he finds out a lot of other unpleasant things, and in Benny Hill fashion, causes havoc everywhere he goes. If he doesn't remind you of Benny Hill, he'll remind you of the characters from the Dandy & Beano comics.

1419702238|2.0|As a middle schooler, I found the first 4 books pretty funny, and I could actually relate to some of the events that took place in them. The 5th book was when I noticed the series was loosing quality, corny stuff. This book is just ridiculous. I found it very corny, only a few weak laughs every now and then. Mainly because of the unrealistically ridiculous things that happen. How long can Greg stay in middle school? He's been there for 5 years now, I'm pretty sure middle school is 4 years at the most. And now a 7nth book in the series? Are you kidding me? I think Jeff should just pull the plug on the series, and make a spin off of it about Greg going to high school. I think someone needs to tell Jeff when it comes to people doing stupid/wierd things, when you get too ridiculous, (spoiler alert[Like when some kids used their socks to soak up energy drink from the sidewalk and wring the socks out into their mouths])It's really not that funny unless you actually see it in real life-No one would ever do that.
B005HV6Y5W|4.0|I have not yet seen this film but I wanted to comment about one thing. I've read about the imagery, dinosaurs, the cosmos, etc, that is interspersed in the film. If you watch most any Malick film, you will see that he uses this, technique, for lack of a better description, in most if not all his films. In fact he is known for this. The thing that I have been left with after seeing some of his films is that this is a artistic watermark that tells you you are watching a Terrence Malick film.

B006TLFPKO|4.0|I bought the downloadable version because I want to wait to buy the dvds until there's a full set. It works great on my roku player and the quality is good - no complaints there. If I should be reviewing the movie itself - well I love it, had already seen it multiple times before this purchase. However, I was really disappointed to discover that the downloadable version does not have any of the extras. Seeing as that was a really highly advertised part of this release and probably the part that I was most looking forward to (since I've seen the movie), it was a real let down - and I would think could have easily been included.

B007BVOF8E|4.0|TINKER TAILOR SOLDIER SPY is a challenging cinematic interpretation of John le Carr&eacute;'s novel of the same name, This is not an action movie: this is a quiet study of how the intelligence operations of several countries function - slowly, quietly, secretly, mesmerizingly, and occultly. To fully comprehend the complex story it would be best to read the novel first: the film condenses a long tale into just over 2 hours and for the uninitiated this can result in a conundrum of semi-fleshed out events. But if you are in for an intense psychological drama that requires 100% of your attention then this is a movie to savor.<br /><br />One aspect of the confusion that accompanies this film's story is the random uses of time changes - some things are shown in various stages of their development as they affect the story and some remain in the present, giving a time travel feel to the film. Odd little bits of action clarify this for the viewer: in the opening of the film George Smiley (Gary Oldman) is fitted for new glasses (a very fine bit of photography form cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema) and that is the clue that when he is wearing his new glasses we are in the present and not in a flashback.<br /><br />As for story it is fairly well known: we are in the Cold War in the 1970s and Control (John Hurt), the irascible Head of the British Intelligence resigns after a botched attempt to ferret out a mole in Hungary by sending Jim Prideaux (Mark Strong) on a mission. Prideaux is killed. Convinced there is a Russian agent serving as a mole Control brings on George Smiley (Gary Oldman) to investigate a story agent Ricky Tarr (Tom Hardy) feels compelled to share. Smiley considers that the failure of the Hungary operation and the continuing success of Operation Witchcraft (an apparent source of significant Soviet intelligence) confirms this, and takes up the task of finding the mole. Through the efforts of Peter Guillam (Benedict Cumberbatch), Smiley obtains information that eventually leads him to Jim Prideaux, the agent at the heart of the Hungary fiasco. And on it goes with the resolution of events offered to the viewer behind the same sort of shady gauze that hides much of the work of Intelligence.<br /><br />The strong cast includes key roles by Toby Jones, David Dencik, Ciar&aacute;n Hinds, Colin Firth and Simon McBurney.  Though Gary Oldman's performance is definitely worthy of the praise he has received, it is the performance by Tom Hardy that sets a level of excellence to which all the other actors must strive to achieve.  Have a good night's sleep that night before viewing, a couple of strong cups of coffee, and stay hyper alert: the film is well worth exploring and digesting.

B006E0PVI6|1.0|I received the abridged edition for Christmas, but I didn't realize it was abridged.  I was disappointed when I finished it and then I noticed the words \\"Abridged Edition\\" in fine print on the bottom of the packaging.  In my opinion, it's a crappy knockoff of the real thing for the purpose of generating more cash for the publisher and author.  As the book points out many times, this is exactly the kind of product that Steve Jobs despised.<br /><br />I have read the full text of the book and would give it four stars...but this is much different.  It's like they picked the gossip editors from some tabloid TV show and asked them to come up with a shorter version.  For example, you learn about which of the original Macintosh team took LSD when they were students, but you learn much less about the breakthroughs they created when they built the first Mac.<br /><br />If you need the audiobook, my recommendation is to make sure you get the unabridged version.  It's a few dollars more and three times longer...but I think it's worth it.  Then again, I am a longtime Apple customer who has spent a little extra over the years because I believe the Apple products are better than less expensive imitations.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I am writing this review having read all three of the Hunger Games series.  This first book, The Hunger Games, was amazing and the best of the series.  When I first heard about the premise of this book, children killing each other in a post-apocalyptic dystopia,  my initial thought was \\"this sounds terrible.\\"  I was wrong.  The writing is descriptive without tedium and it brings the reader into a fully composed universe that gives the reader a lot of room for imagination.  The story itself is gripping and the reader NEEDS to know what happens to the protagonist, Katniss Everdeen with every page turn.  The prose is written for the young adult reader, so do not expect literary fiction.  There are two bad things about the Hunger Games: 1. you will need to read the other two books immediately; 2. you will stay up to all hours reading and this may affect your life negatively in the morning.  Enjoy!
B0072GPQNG|5.0|S.Spielberg gold. He took a long-loved youth's book written in 1982, and transformed it into a film so beautiful it reminded me of the English Countryside painter Thomas Gainsborough 18th century. Having been educated to teach visual art, I was captivated with the continual perfection of composition of very scene, seemingly every frame. I am an avid British film/TV viewer, but `War Horse' cinematography meets the highest of anything I have seen to date. The period sets, scenery, and costuming are perfection transforming the viewer into a time capsule of 1914 to the end of WWI. Stunning aesthetic mastery.<br /><br />Janusz Kaminski must get some credit with Spielberg for the cinematography perfection.<br /><br />I did read the book first and was confident (viewing the film proved me correct) that Spielberg would be true to the book. It's about as close as a film can get to a book. Being a shorter book, written for ages 11-13 originally, and the movie length (146 min) helped provide all of the needed key points of the story of the amazing red bay Joey. One could say plenty about the fine acting but it is the story, and the compelling adventures of the horse, told through the view-point of Joey (akin to Black Beauty) that makes this a must see, and once available, for me will be a MUST OWN.<br /><br />The viewer literally rides through all kinds of situations, some heart wrenching, some heart stopping, some heart breaking, some heartache, while others end heart warming. Is it the horse that has all the heart and pours out from the screen; or is it the mastery of another Steven Spielberg directing/producing production that makes your pulse rise and fall in alarming changes? This is the first film in many a year that actually left me on the brink of tears. The end was so stunning that my wife and I could not move, could not get up and leave during the credits, and that was a plus since the credits footage contain some beautiful music that revives one's spirit after such an experience.<br /><br />Yes, there is warfare, and from WWI books and photos I have seen, and a grandfather's eyewitness accounting, the film shows the war accurately.

0823003590|5.0|Beautifully reproduced drawings, with close-ups and progress drawing of eyes, mouths, the problematic nose...I heartily agree with the other five-star reviews here. One reviewer said that the book concentrates on three-quarters views, but that's not strictly true. The author angles from above and below, there are straight-on views, and even one from the top of the head. The approach is constructionist, and the emphasis is on rendering the topography of the face in light and shadow. The portraits are very natural. Love this book!

B004EPZ0AM|5.0|I would normally boycott this type of movie, because sequels such as this are designed to make money and nothing more, but it's DANCING PENGUINS. It's cute fun, and better than alot of other animated money-grabbers. The psycho who created 200+ accounts to write bad reviews for this movie has WAY too much time on his or her hands. How can you hate something as adorable as DANCING PENGUINS! It was adorable, and that's all it was supposed to be.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|Several weeks ago I saw a trailer for a science fiction flic called John Carter. All that was shown was a virtually unkown cast(which I love when done right), a pretty  red -skinned girl that was obviously wearing a ton of make-up on that wasn't explained, a man throwing people around as if they were light as a feather, some flying ships, something about Mars, and some green skinned aliens with 4 arms. The movie that was depicted in this $250 million budgeted blockbuster's trailer was that of something you go out of your way to avoid and dislike without ever giving it a try, or seeing it.<br /><br />The fact is, this movie is nothing like the badly put together trailers for it. You are on the edge of your seat the entire time being fed little by little an amazing journey with a storyline, plot, universe, and characters to not just rival Avatar, but to top it. You are drawn in through a historical yet science fiction 19th century atmosphere that has you questioning if your in the right movie or not. The flashbacks and pre-setups that take place from everything to the current timeline of the story to the main characters previous family keep you interested, intrigued, and not able to predict some linear obvious plot like today's movies normaly do. The main storyline continues to entice all the way through till what seems to be an ending to the main plot and a temporary but happy ending to the romantic subplot.<br /><br />Romance, no matter how many people try to deny it, makes or brakes a movie. The cast involved, the emotional levels, the depth or lack of depth involved, the accurate gestures, the dialogue, etc. lays the foundation for the plot. John Carter's romance provides a perffect mixture of mystery, fueds, drama, and just the right amount of screen time to make the actual plot believable and interactive.<br /><br />Being a part of the technological generation that has strayed away from reading and more towards social networking, television, and movies is almost a curse. I had never heard of the amazing book franchise that sparked this motion pictures creation and funded the breathtaking world that is John Carter. I inted to read the first books I haven't had to read for college in the next couple months, and they will be the novels that inspired John Carter.<br /><br />John Carter deserves more than just a sequel, and I believe 90% of the science fiction fans who have actually seen the movie and not the trailers or negative reviews know this. Nothing else can be said besides the marketing FAIL on behalf of Disney or if the director really was solo'ly responsible for the advertisement. Anyone with a brain can tell there a significant market for science fiction in this messed up world we live in with a disapearing middle class and a growing instability in governments. Disney would be out of their minds to not introduce a new commercial or last minute advertisement campaign and attempt to gain a larger gross from the weeks John Carter still has in theatres and the dvd release.<br /><br />10/10 and replaces Avatar in my mind as the most interesting fantasy universe I have yet to come across and would like more of. I will continue to spread the word of what a real movie should look like, like John Carter.a curse.

This 'God' created the earth similar to the way of the bible. That is repulsive that amazon sees the whole opening sequence without thinking this is very pegan with the premise of the all seeing eye as God. confirms that this developer made a choice to mess with Biblical beliefs and supplant the real creator with some illuminate knock-off

0316098329|5.0|Room<br /><br />Author: Emma Donoghue<br />Reviewed By Fran Lewis<br /><br />The four walls of a room can often be confining when you are sick and unable to get around. But, what happens when the four walls become your only outlet with the world, your only environment and the only person that you see is you mother. From the day he was born Jack's world evolved in the space of an entire Room. His mother, Ma was kidnapped and lived in the room for seven years, gave birth to her son there and spent years nurturing, teaching and caring for this precious child. Let's enter Jack's mind and world as we hear his voice throughout the novel telling his story.<br /><br />As you enter the room and see the surroundings you understand the world in which this mother and son have been confined. The inner core of the room has little space, a bed, a wardrobe where Jack often hides, television which provides his only real connection with the outside and real world and the small skylight that some light comes through before the darkness falls and envelopes them. Creating a real world within a closed and sealed room is frightening to say the least. But, what if this is the only world you know would you be afraid? One woman who was kidnapped on her way to a college class, enters the world of one man who owns her every being, decides on her fate, provides her with some small comforts in life and expects her gratitude in ways no one would deem right.<br /><br />As our narrator, five year old Jack, relates his story, his life, how he and his mom referred to as Ma spend their days and nights, you wonder how they deal with the closed quarters, only their company and the knowledge deep within that there is much more out there than what they have. Yet, Jack is grateful for the small things and when he prays he expresses how happy he is with television, Ma, toys and the things that help sustain both of them except for Old Nick. Smart, inquisitive, wise beyond his five years Jack lives within animaginary and real world that he has created for himself. As you hear his voice, his inner most thoughts and begin to understand the mind of a five year old trying to live in a world that exists of just one other, his fantasies and his imagination. What about Ma? What can she do for an outlet to release herself from Jack so that he grows into his own person without leaving him? Yet when Old Nick invades their world and her bed things change and Jack hides in the wardrobe unseen, quiet and hopes that he won't hurt his mother and create the scratches that he sees on her neck every time he leaves.<br /><br />Bedtime stories made up games, Old Nick's voice as he rationalizes his treatment to her and her need for the pills he gives her to stay alive, yet selfish, only caring about himself and complaining about his finances while she and Jack remain alone. Locked in the wardrobe until she comes for him he endures the fears, bad dreams and wiles of a man who thinks what he is doing is right.<br /><br />Time to create plan to escape. As Ma hopes to create a permanent diversion to trick Old Nick into opening the door and getting them out The end result is quite unique as they finally encounter a police officer and they hope to find Room and release Ma too. The end result is one brave boy named Jack and freedom. Imagine seeing your first doctor and going through your first exam. Jack's perception of people and who they are is still not quite correct but he adjusts, as his Ma has to endure even more. Seeing themselves on TV was not exactly what they expected when they went to the hospital. Interacting with the world and the doctors seems awkward for Jack and even his mother. Now that Nick is in jail they should feel safe. From meeting Dr. Clay to his real grandmother and trying to deal with the real world Jack is truly amazing and his reactions to most things quite remarkable and unique. Throughout the end of the novel Jack meets his grandparents, learns more about his mother's feelings towards her father and is embraced by the staff and patients at Cumberland Clinic. Seven years in what most would save captivity and dealing with a miscarriage and then the birth of her son, as she recounts the events for reporters. Going to live with his grandmother when his mother is ill frightens him but Jack is truly special and he learns to deal with this separation.<br /><br />As Jack learns more about the real world, meets other children he tries to understand what things are and yet seems lost without his Ma. His grandma and Steppa  (grandfather) teach him a lot when his Ma is sick but he never quite understands everything. Jack is quite unique and needs closure and what he does at the end of the story will surprise the reader and make you wonder just who the grownup is in the story. Book, toys, bikes, a soccer ball and seeing a library for the first time and just going to the part Room takes the reader on a journey that most kids should never experience and will endear you to a mother who gave up more than just her dignity in order to survive in Room. With the help of Dr. Clay and his staff and finally getting a place of their own they have many miles to go and many hurdles to climb but together they will definitely and hopefully close the door to Room for good.<br /><br />This is one book that brings to light what happens when one mother goes protects her son at all costs, teaches him manners, love, understanding and most of all respect for life. Four walls can be confining when you are trapped and locked in or they can be your world and you can learn from the things you have at hand. One man that tried to take it all away from them and one woman who fought back with the help of one special young boy named Jack.<br /><br /> A must read for everyone as you will appreciate the little things in life and just being a family after reading Room.<br /><br />This book gets FIVE OPEN DOORS WITH NO LOCKS!

0141439831|5.0|This novel is one of my five or so favorites, and one of a kind.  I think there is also a case for saying it is one of the best and most original ever written.  It is certainly one of a kind.  Structurally, it has some flaws, but the brilliance of its wit and its unflinching confrontation of harsh realities make it a novel to read and re-read.  I can't think of any modern writer who is prepared to look life so fully in the face, and still laugh.  You will be plunged into Georgian England, and enjoy every vivid minute of Thackery's genius.

It also ran through the emotional marathon of the crazy relationship between Ana and Christian, which had so many ups and downs, but interestingly always had me wanting more. I will say that E.L. James giving the teaser at the end made me want the whole trilogy from Christian's point of view now. I hope E.L. James does that.

B0025UHKNS|5.0|I have  been using the 405CX now for a week, and I'm very pleased with the results..It has incredibly accurate GPS function, and it gathers all data and transfers it so easily through the my Win7 computer to Garmin Connect. I like the fact that they have eliminated all but two buttons, and every thing else is controlled by the touch sensitive bezel that surrounds the crystal. The controls requires tap, or touch & hold (for 2 seconds).  The face light is controlled by using a two finger touch and it is nice and bright.  I've used it as a handy light when no flashlight was on hand.<br /><br />I was using my smartphone's GPS and one of the Android training apps(Endomoundo), but the watch is far more accurate and easier to manage when I'm in action.  I would have had to spend $75 for a heart monitor, and this accessory is included in the 405CX box. The watch contains a re-chargeable battery, and a one hour run uses only about 15% of the charge. Adapters for the power adapter are included if you are out of the US. And I think the USB charging cable can be used through your computer's ports. But I have not done that yet. The watch strap is broad, secure and comfortable, with additional Velcro straps included in the box along with a small tool required to change the band.<br /><br />Garmin did an excellent job here and provides the support to make this a terrific purchase at Amazon's price.
B006M4RN3U|3.0|I think everyone has heard \\"We Are Young\\" which is a great song. After seeing them perform on whomever's talk show, can't remember who, I decided to order the cd. The song \\"Some Nights Intro\\" is awesome! Very Queen-ish in my opinion.<br /><br />I was a little apprehensive reading about auto-tuning reviews. I hate auto-tuning but thought I'd give Fun. a  chance. Now, there are about four songs that have auto-tuning that I could detect, correct me if I'm wrong:<br /><br />\\"Some Nights\\" - has it towards the end. Totally unnecessary. Took away from the song.<br /><br />\\"It Gets Better\\" - auto-tuning from the get go. Not a bad song but Ugh, the auto-tuning needs to go!!<br /><br />\\"All Alright\\" - not completely sure there is auto-tuning here. Sounds like it in the beginning combined with the lead singers voice but it's light or it was a girl's voice? Sometimes it was a hard to tell. If it was auto-tuning, again, why? I read a review stating that auto-tuning wasn't used to enhance vocals but the songs themselves. I disagree. It hurts the songs. It doesn't mesh well at all.<br /><br />\\"Stars\\" - Could not even get through the entire song, the auto-tuning WAS THAT BAD. It grated on my nerves so bad I wanted to punch my cd player. Couldn't fast forward quick enough. Just stop!!<br /><br />I do like the cd. I will skip the overused auto-tuning songs because \\"We Are Young\\" is really great and to me worth buying the cd.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I really enjoy this game ... plenty of options to set your own challenge level and great delivery with a fun, interesting theme
B004T2QZL8|2.0|I really enjoyed this game when I started playing it on my Kindle Fire. I got 16 different elements and it seemed to be working great. Then I had to set it aside and when I came back to it, every time I would go to create a new element, it would force close. Elements I had already created would work, but nothing new. I shut my Fire down and tried it again later, still the same force close problem.<br /><br />I really hope there is a fix in the works, because I believe it could be a five-star game. At this time, I can only give it two stars because it is unplayable after one session and extremely frustrating with repeated force closes.

B0002VFXFE|5.0|After building 4 computers i still come to this amazing product when i install the CPU and its complimentary cooler. I've always received stock thermal compounds, as i'm sure you have also, when buying your cooler or processor. Quite frankly, those don't even compare to the quality and ability this paste has. This paste allows you to grasp the full potential of the cooler you're buying, and is very reliable; know that if your CPU still overheats after using this compound, then it's your cooler. ***With this compound the use of a higher grade cooling system allows the cooling of your CPU to grow exponentially. I have numerous types of coolers on all 4 computers i built, and i have put this compound on each one. Doing so, i notice that with whatever cooling system i have set it up with (From stock to water cooling) it'll harness every bit of potential that system has to offer.<br /><br />An important note.. Do not think that this compound will magically cool your CPU for things like overclocking and high loads. If you have a problem with overheating you should probably buy a better cooling system. If you buy a nice enough cooler, then this paste will compliment it greatly. I don't recommend buying this product in hope that your overheating problems will be solved (I was dumb enough to do that at first).<br /><br />Overall.. this is the paste i always order when building a computer for myself or for a friend, and I've tried others but there is just something about that dark grey look to the stock compounds that sets me away from trusting it fully.<br /><br />This paste will for sure harness more potential from your cooling system, and alone will probably give you somewhere between 5-10% better cooling. That means a lot to a geek (lol). That means 5-10% more overclocking, or 5-10% longer life span if left alone.

This album clearly shows that Miles was a true innovator: always a step ahead of everyone else from the time of the cool album from the 1940's, to Milestones in the 50's, to the combo with Tony Williams, Herbie Hancock, Wayne Shorter in the mid sixties, to Bitches Brew, and then this.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|This bible is so easy.to use and allows one to change versions very quickly. It has become my \\"go to\\" bible.
0061251321|5.0|When I first saw the title of this book before reading it, I immediately recalled great leaders throughout ancient history, including those whom Homer discusses in his two epic poems, the Iliad and the Odyssey as well as those featured in plays written by Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides. More than 2,000 years later, the tribal leaders that Dave Logan, John King, and Halee Fischer-Wright discuss in this book are \\"natural leaders,\\" as were Achilles, Odysseus, Orestes, and Oedipus. However, they lead fellow workers rather than warriors to \\"victory\\" in the business world rather than on a battlefield. Moreover, what the co-authors mean by a \\"tribe\\" is a naturally occurring group of 20-150 people. Viewed this way, an organization becomes an interconnected series of these tribes. The key to changing an organization is to upgrade its tribes, one member at a time, through one stage at a time.<br /><br />As I shall soon discuss in more detail, their view of stages is the key to getting an organization at least to the fourth of five stages of development.  Their view is very practical: how to transform an organization. What they propose is based on a ten-year set of research studies that involved 24,000 people in two dozen organizations, with their members located around the world. The co-authors share what they learned from their research in this book.<br /><br />For example, how to build and then sustain strong relationships between and among an organization's tribal members. As they explain, \\"Every tribe has a dominant culture, which we can peg on a one-to-five scale, with Stage Five being most desirable. All things being equal, a Five culture will always outperform a Four culture, which will outperform a Three culture, and so on.\\" Paradoxically, the leadership challenge is to strengthen a tribe until it becomes a Four or Five culture while allowing it to function collaboratively within a federation with other tribes. In essence, the strength of a tribe is determined by the health of its culture.<br /><br />In Chapter 3, Logan, King, and Fischer-Wright introduce and explain what they characterize as \\"the tribal leadership navigation system.\\" Its purpose is help leaders in the 75% of companies whose workplace tribes have a cultural Stage Three or below to locate the leverage points by which to nudge their company forward (i.e. higher) faster while emerging as a tribal leader. The co-authors suggest how to determine the current culture stage and then explain what is needed to reach the next stage.<br /><br />One key point is that advancing a tribe is most efficiently achieved one member at a time. Aspiring leaders, therefore, must keep in mind that they have two eyes, two ears, but only one mouth. Therefore, they should spend at least 80% of their time observing what is (and isn't) happening and listening to what is (and isn't) said. Those whom Logan, King, and Fischer-Wright cite as effective tribal leaders (e.g. Griffin Hospital's David Charmel, the U.S. Olympic hockey team's Mike Eruzione, IDEO's David Kelley, and the Moore Foundation's Frank Jordan) have highly developed skills for \\"reading\\" a person's tone of voice and body language.<br /><br />Personal note: My own experience while working closely with several hundred companies is that one of the most revealing indicators is workers' use of pronouns. Those who are actively and productively engaged use first-person plural pronouns almost exclusively. Those who are passively engaged or actively disengaged (i.e. dysfunctional) seldom do.<br /><br />Credit Logan, King, and Fischer-Wright with making especially effective use of various reader-friendly devices. For example, Technical Notes, Key [Chapter] Points, Coaching Tips, Summaries, Leverage Points for a Person (per Stage), and Success Indicators. These devices facilitate, indeed expedite frequent review later.<br /><br />Here in a single volume is about as much information, insights, and advice as a business leader needs to help her or his \\"tribe\\" (be it a department, division, or company) to develop and then sustain at least a Four culture. The success of those efforts, however, must be collaborative in nature and continuous at all levels and in all areas of the given enterprise.lp her or his \\"tribe\\" (be it a department, division, or company) to develop and then sustain at least a Four culture.

1423140591|5.0|The book came in in great (new) condition. i looked in numerous stores but i couldn't find the book two in the series. i ordered it for my little brother. he loved it.
1439192812|5.0|I purchased \\"The Magic of Reality\\" for my family and my 11 y/o son (who despises reading) absolutely loves it. He said it's the first book he's ever enjoyed reading. Dawkins writes with clarity; however, not a page has been 'dumbed down' as other children's books can be. (I say 'children's book' but actually it is a fine book for the whole family.) \\"Magic of Reality\\" encourages excellent discussion as it stimulates critical thinking skills. The cherry on top would have to be the brilliant illustrations. The perfect science book for families.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|This is such a common issue apparently, I really wished developers would put more effort into this issue. HTC Incredible.
B00005OAID|5.0|I worked my way back to this album - Mayer's debut - after BATTLE STUDIES. And it doesn't disappoint. This album reminds me of Coldplay's PARACHUTES. Just like PARACHUTES, RFS as some reviewers and fans would refer to this album has zero fillers. Every single cut is consistently strong in the melody and lyrics departments. I've always been partial to singer songwriters like Suzanne Vega,James Taylor, Sting, Jackson Browne, et al.Mayer I believe continues their tradition.  I have a lot of respect for people who take time to think of the words that would comprise their songs instead of just leveraging on technology. Over the years, however, I've been finding myself drawn to albums which are very melodic and very strong in musicality. And the nice thing about these albums is that as they draw you in with their musicality and as you peruse the words that make up the cuts of the album, you realize there's more to discover in the songs beyond the hooks and the riffs. ROOM FOR SQUARES is one such album.<br /><br />The vinyl format is tops and delivery of this product was 2 weeks before the promised arrival. Thank you, AMAZON.
B004T2QZL8|3.0|it was fun but it keeps crashing at a.certant. point.!!!!!  so annoying i think it crashes at 28 elemements.  this is on the kindle fire
B004T2QZL8|3.0|it force closes when I combine elements that don't work. but when they do work it just makes a new element. fix the fc issue and the app should get 5 stars.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|great game love playing alchemy games this is well worth the $2.99 you pay for it :)  since the update there are no more crashes and works very well
B005PK55BE|4.0|Worth watching and a must have! I just find Mrs. good wife not in her best as far as acting is concerned..<br />She' trying  hard to act that her portrayal comes out  unnatural!  I found the other characters' potrayal<br />excellent though.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love it.  So many games in. My son loves it more than I do. So when I need points I just give it to him so its great for me and him.
B0065NPI5I|5.0|I'm very happy with this album. I've been a Sting fan since DREAM OF THE BLUE TURTLES. Most of my Sting albums are on CD format but when vinyl made a comeback, I started tracking down near mint vinyl versions of his albums. So far, I've tracked down DREAM..., NOTHING LIKE THE SUN, BRING ON THE NIGHT and SOUL CAGES. TEN SUMMONERS' TALES and MERCURY FALLING continue to elude me. So when this album came out on vinyl format and it contained selections from said albums, I knew I couldn't let it pass.<br /><br />I would also like to commend AMAZON for their trust and confidence in a loyal customer. When I wrote them to complain about my first purchase being too warped on one side (the other side was good), they immediately sent a replacement. THANK YOU, AMAZON. I already wrote this separately but I'm writing it again. I'm a raving AMAZON fan. May you continue to thrive.

B004T2QZL8|5.0|I loved this game online, so I bought it for my iPod and iPhone, and when I found out they had it for my Kindle Fire, I was thrilled! It's free on the Apple App Store, so I'm glad they have it for the free app of the day on Amazon.
B00689J512|5.0|I really love this album. I can listen to it all the way through without skipping any songs which makes it a really good buy for my money.
B005MYEPXC|5.0|One of the Best Movies I have seen, at first I had reservations, when I found out that it was a Woody Allen film, but after seeing it. The scenery, story and the actors were great. It is one very good movie.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|This app still has issues. Force closes and slows down the longer you play.  really needs work.  good game play though.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|Now that the glitch is fixed, GREAT GAME! :) Definitely worth the download. I need more words for the review to post so, purple monkey dishwasher.
B0063IH60K|5.0|this game is my favorite and i would always play it on the computer. now i can take it with me!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|love this game..... very addictive!!!! very hard however to figure out how to get neighbors.... but still fun either way
B00006FDCD|4.0|I watched this movie so many times as a kid whenever we would rent an armfull of cheesy horror movies. This is a classic horror movie; my only complaint is the length - a bit excessive in that department.
B00011KHTM|4.0|great for hooking up a mac book to an external monitor.  It works perfectly unless the cord gets bent, then it screws up the colors.  Just be sure to keep the cord as straight as possible.  Other than this it works amazingly.
B0019K06WM|3.0|cool and listenable album if you dig crosby, stills, & nash or csny. a little slow and boring at times, so, if you lean more towards the ROCKOUT end of things, you might find your attention wandering and you might be better served by the csny compilation called 'so far' or the csny studio album, 'deja vu'--the album absolutely never goes beyond mid-tempobut nevertheless, there are some gems here: south bound train, immigration man, frozen smiles, the wall song, and where will i be. cool mellow listen .just doesn't get  played  too often.
0307957934|2.0|Harris fell in love with his subject; in truth, seems amazed by his own investigation into hedge funds and high frequency trading.  He should have written an essay for Harpers or the Altantic or The Economist (the poet interprets the engineer)... but he didn't, he cobbled together his information -- unquestionably interesting, even scary -- into a threadbare, predictable potboiler that formally self-destructs in the third act.  It literally ceases to be a point-of-view narrative and instead turns into descriptions of what security cameras captured.  The world he limns should end with a bang, but this book ends with a whimper.
B006T5LGXA|3.0|Vincent Damon Furnier...that's \\"Alice\\" to you...serves up a two-CD memento from his October 29th, 2011 show at London's Alexandra Place. As you might expect, Alice knows what the fans came for. A little less than half of the 98-minute set, 10 songs, are drawn from the catalog of the original Alice Cooper band. There's one track from the new [[ASIN:B005F6NA4W Welcome 2 My Nightmare]], and three from the original [[ASIN:B000002I99 Welcome to My Nightmare]] album. Alice's voice is a little more ragged around the edges than it was in his 70s heyday, ducking the occasional high note here and there, but for the most part it's not an issue. The only song that really falls flat is \\"Feed My Frankenstein,\\" and that's because the original was so heavily produced and featured the dueling guitars of Steve Vai and Joe Satriani, while this one doesn't. Great to hear the song, but the original set the bar so high that it's impossible not to be at least a little disappointed.<br /><br />The original show aired on U.S. and U.K. television, and was also sold on CD as an \\"instant live\\" release, so this isn't \\"new\\" to hardcore Alice fans. For everyone else, it's a romp through the hits. Three solid stars.
B00012QM8G|5.0|Schindler's List (1993) directed by Steven Spielberg. Liam Neeson played Oskar Schindler. The movie (a true History) is set in Poland during World War II. After the Polish army was defeated by the German army, thousands of Jews were ordered to register with the Nazis and relocate to major cities. Oskar Schindler was a business man that needed capital to start a business, and he finds help on Itzhak Stern A Jewish accountant that introduce him to a couple of Jews that agree to lend Mr. Schindler money to start a factory making pans and pots using Jewish labor. The business started good, he was making money and getting to know the Germans and making relations with them, buying them dinners, presents (mostly liquor), fine cigars, caviar and women. Workers in Schindler's factory were allowed outside the ghetto, and Stern falsified documents to ensure that as many people as possible were deemed \\"essential\\" to the German war effort, which saves them from being transported to concentration camps, or being killed. SS lieutenant Amon Goeth arrives to oversee the construction of the of Plaszow concentration camp while in there he orders the liquidation of the ghetto where Germans will remove Jews from the overpopulated rooms where they were living and move them to the concentration camp, anyone that protested would be killed. Goeth also killed Jews indiscriminately most of the time for no reason at all, he would use them as target practice, at least once he tried to be good to the Jews but he could not do it and ended killing a boy just because he was cleaning a tub.<br />Oskar Schindler saw all this atrocities and gradually became concern for the Jewish that worked at his factory; he changed from producing pans and pots to a munitions factory for the Germans, together with Itzhak Stern came up with a list of Jewish people that they both knew and presented it to the German authorities as skilled workers that he wanted for his factory.  . In all he made a list of about one thousand names that were send to work in his factory, in seven months his factory did not passed any test and the quality of his products was bad but the Jewish working there were safe and protected, Schindler spent all his millions to sustain his workers and bribe the German officials.<br />Finally German unconditional surrender was signed to the allies to end the war, after 6 years of terror, Jews would be free. When Schindler was going to leave he was given a ring made by the Jewish in the camp, the material it was made of came from someone's teeth  and had an encryption in Hebrew from the Torah that said \\"whoever save one life, saves the world entire\\" and also a letter that everyone signed, but before he left he started to regret not being able to save more people and all the money he wasted that could have used to save more people The movie ends with the Jewish he saved honoring his tomb, Oskar Schindler died in 1974.<br /><br />This movie is a memory of the worse time in human history, but it also reflects how someone can make a difference in people's lives if we just do not think about ourselves only but everyone else. Although Oskar Schindler helped the Jewish and keeps them safe he wanted them to maintain his identity and towards the end of the movie he asks one of his workers to remember that it was Friday and it was Sabbath (a day dedicated for rest and worship).

B005Y423ZC|5.0|I liked her on the radio, but seeing her perform \\"in person\\" on this tape , made me love her style, her talent, her ability to be vulnerable and totally open. Because of this perrformance here, I will buy her stuff for the rest of our lives.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I had a little trouble downloading and installing the app (I think it was the tablet's fault), but eventually, I got it done.  It's awesome to be able to share my books between my tablet and my Kindle.  Yes!!!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Works just like I expected, but better! User interface is very intuitive. Cannot believe it was this easy! Best purchase I've made in the app store in years.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game (these games)are awesome.Its better than just buying all of these games seperately.I think anyone would love this(these)games.My friend showed me this game.And I tried it out on lots of my other friends and they loved it.So if you're reading this review,buy it!
B0030V0PEW|4.0|The book is very well written.  Makes a good case for use of checklists in order to simply or streamline complex processes / situations.  Many examples come from the medical world, but suggestions / methodologies apply to many other disciplines as well.  Overall, an informative and entertaining piece of writing.
B002KT3XH6|4.0|An amazing book, so well-researched and well-written!  BUT THE KINDLE EDITION HAS NO CHAPTER BREAKS, and you must go through the entire book one page at a time.  This is a problem for those of us who like to skip around in a familiar story.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|If you're a dog lover this book will make you change the way you look at your dog and wonder if he really does know what you're saying to him.  This is a great book because it touches every one of your emotions, it will make you laugh out loud and sob too.  Great dog!!!!!
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|I've come to realize that some very young kids are lost watching Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away.  They are beautiful but also very long and the concepts are too complex.  In this movie the main characters are preschool age and the story is told from that viewpoint for the most part.  This still has the beauty and magic of the longer Miyazaki movies but it is shorter and the plot is much simpler.<br /><br />The underwater scenes, even the flooding, are beautiful.  The childrens' adventure to reach the other side of town is epic.  That's just how it would be for little kids to reach the other side of a flooded town by themselves.  I don't understand the mother driving like a maniac everytime she gets into a car.  That's about the only part of this movie I don't like.  Otherwise I think it's great to introduce little kids to the Miyazaki they will love a little later on.
B006WWTKQ0|5.0|Please disregard the trolling party reviews and don't let your kids miss out on this jewel. Mumble now has his little one, Erik, the new adorable movie centerpiece. Get it in 3d - the effects are a great enhancement. There are lessons of cooperation and friendship - interspecies empathy. If you liked the first, this definitely won't disappoint you.
B00514HDNW|4.0|I bought the book yesterday, downloaded it last night and read in under four hours this morning.  I have to admit that though the book is a good read, i enjoyed the movie more.  I guess i must like almost happy endings to sad endings.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love these games, they def occupy &amp; pass the time. some are extremely easy while others are very hard. Good for kids too
B000002MNL|5.0|I remember being so excited to purchase this album when it was first released in the Spring of 1994. It absolutely met and exceeded my standards of what a Morrissey album should be, it terms of lyrics and music. It was then, and remains to this day, one of my favorite albums of all times.<br /><br />From the mellow, lush, \\"Now My Heart is Full\\" to the quirky, pop-y \\"Billy Budd\\" to the more assertive \\"Speedway\\", it is just a fabulous listen, through and through. There is a real cinematic quality to this album, (and not just because there are snippets from old British films and documentaries in some of the songs), but in terms of the songs telling a story of someone trying to find himself in a very hostile world. As previous reviews on Amazon and other sites have alluded to, many regard this as Morrissey's \\"coming out album\\", and I definitely agree with that interpretation.<br /><br />  The most famous track from the album, \\"The More You Ignore Me, the Closer I Get\\", has to be one of the most intelligently written \\"alternative\\" songs ever (and the only one to my knowledge to mention \\"lonely high court judges\\"!). And for my money, my most favorite, and the most haunting track is \\"Why Don't You Find Out For Yourself?\\", which only gets better on every listen. Morrissey's voice and lyrics were in amazing form with this album, and when you add to it the sensual photographs both on the front and (especially) the back cover, to me, you just don't get any better. Highly, highly recommended.
B0072PUC7W|3.0|Not my favorite State of Trance from Armin.  Kind of \\"edgy\\" (in a bad way) and annoying.  I miss the smooth selections from other years.  Overall a disappointment.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is the best app for my iPad and iPhone.  My Bible is always with me. You can easily adjust the font, select which version you want and it is very easy to navigate.  You can highlight favorite passages and make notes.  Highly recommend this!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is awesome for just having quick fun in the office or at home. I would recommend it to all
0307956350|5.0|In poker there is a saying that if you look around the table and you can't find the fish, you are it.  But what if you think otherwise?  This is a clever story of trying to evade detection at doing bad things for ostensibly good reasons.  It is interesting how each character is up to more than you might initially think.  I enjoyed it and recommend it.
0553582038|5.0|I gave this book 5 stars because it is the best sleep inducing device I've ever tried. Here's how I take it. I hit the sack between 10PM and 11PM, manage to get 2 to 4 pages read before becoming so drowsy I need tootpicks to keep my eyelids open. It works like a charm. \\"Then Biter chomped the face off poor, homely Brienne in order to make her more homely, a face that only Jaime One-Stump, the crippled lion could love...\\" ZZZZZZZZZ!<br /><br />The paperback version I read had 1,053 pages, not counting a free nap, uh, I mean chapter. Let's say I average 4 pages per night, that's 263.25 night's of easy sleep between two covers! I think I paid $8.99 for the book, so that's a little over 3 pennies per \\"4 page pill!\\" Well worth the price, I'd say! At just 4 pages, there's no danger of overdose, either. This prescription works equally well on planes, trains, and buses.<br /><br />Contraindications include danger of getting mugged in your sleep if you read it in a dark alley or a roomful of strangers.

B004T2QZL8|3.0|I love alchemy games and this one is fantastic until it forcecloses. Fix it! W/o the forceclose it would be five star!
B000RVK1AQ|5.0|The movie was great as long as you are looking for pure entertainment.  I purchased this as an instant video.  I had no problems with the streaming; picture and audio were perfect.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Love it to the Nth degree! It is the type of book you can't put down and find yourself totally involved in.  I can't wait to see the movie version.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I'm finding it hard to understand all the high ratings for this book. I don't have any problem with the subject matter, that's one of the reasons I bought it, but the writing is terrible - horribly juvenile. I've been reading it piecemeal because I can't stand seeing \\"holy sh!&/holy crap/jeez/oh my\\" every other paragraph along with the frequent mentions of a subconscious described as a thin-lipped harpy and an inner-goddess with pompoms (doing cartwheels). Use of the expression \\"argh\\" brings pirates to mind, not hot sex. There's better erotica out there. This is NOT well done. I also kind of hate the fact that Ana's goal is to \\"fix\\" Christian, as though there is something wrong with him because normal people don't behave this way.
B006UG90RM|1.0|I have been a Life long VanHalen Fan since their \\"Mammoth\\" days. It seemed that Van Halen was destined to Rise to the top of the Rock Mountain, and stay there. All went well, and they were riding high. Ted Templeman knew how to steer the VanHalen boys into some of the most Driving Rock songs ever!  Then came the School yard fighting and in-band pissing matches. So then die hard fans were left out in the cold until VanHalen 3. I was less than impressed at this massive waste of time. Gary Cherone? Who was the genius behind THAT stupid move? Until now, it was the biggest collection of garbage i had ever heard. Now its 2012. A fresh beginning...?<br /> Dave finally returns and the boys put out \\"A different Kind of Truth\\" This album should've been named \\"A different kind of useless Garbage\\" I thought that maybe, JUST MAYBE, after Dave's BRIEF Return for the 2 new tracks on the \\"Best of\\" album, to churn out a true VanHalen song like \\"Me Wise Magic\\" that \\"...Truth\\" might actually be their return to glory. NOPE. I wasted $12 on a drink coaster that you can actually put in your CD player.<br /> This album is more reminiscent of the CRAP, that is present all over top 40 radio.<br /><br />Don't waste you're money on this Garbage, And if you already have, then you're like me, pissed off, with a new drink coaster, that has the VH Logo on it...  YUCK!
0553826166|5.0|I HAVE READ ALL OF THE JACK REACHER SERIES AND<br />HAVE REALLY ENJOYED THEM.  I LIKE THE ACTION AND THE<br />STORY LINES.  KEEP ON WRITNG THEM.
B006ZEDZNY|1.0|I rented the video, which worked very well.  I did not have any problems with the Amazon video streaming.  I also liked how the application's search engine.  It was very easy to use and worked well on my TV.  The moving couldn't decide what it wanted to be a comedy or a drama.  It was neither and, therefore, failed miserably.

B005ZBBKHQ|5.0|Most casual listeners of The Cure are more familiar with their later work (late 1980's on) but what about the early stuff?  This boxed set gives you that dark, heavy, post-punk era sound they started off with in one package.  It is perfect for the die hard fan, or for that casual lister wanting to know how it all got started.  In short, no Cure music collection would be complete without these five albums.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|A great CD.  Love it. A very talented individual. The music appeals to a wide range of ages and people.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Works great on the kindle fire, very fast to load and scroll in both landscape and normal mode. Will sometimes lag a slight bit on my Evo 3D, and on rare occasions will only load one page at a time if my inbox/folders are super full when viewing on that device. However, for 99% of the time there is no problems when using. Would definitely recommend, very user friendly!
B000TDIEX8|4.0|It has all the cinematic emotion that made the movies great. If you like rocky this album will take you through all the ups and downs he went though,all the classic them music is there and then some.

B004XJRQUQ|2.0|This digital download is missing pages book two in chapter one is missing 15 pages<br />But the book is great
B002MQYOFW|2.0|Even though there is a TON of hype about this book, I just flat out hated it.  The premise of future-type semi-apocalyptic USA was a draw to me, but I HATED the characters and just wasn't drawn into the book.  Most interesting characters are Cinna and the President and neither gets much draw in these books, and I only wanted to finish it to get to the next 2 in the series.  Unfortunately, they didn't get any better and the following books were trash too.
B003Y5H5HY|1.0|I really really wanted to like this. I was completely open minded because any Lisbeth is better than no Lisbeth but I was so wrong. I didn't think anyone could mess up such a wonderful source material but again I was wrong.<br />SPOILER CONTAINED IN THIS REVIEW<br />I love and I mean love this book. I love the Swedish version (both regular and extended versions). I literally watched all 9 hours in a row and then watched TGWTDT a second time. I can not express my love of these characters esp Lisbeth. So I was excited to have an American version even though I thought it was unneccesary. Boy was I wrong. I don't know what they were thinking with the script. As much as I want to blame that bratty actress Rooney Mara for a bad portrayal, she looked the part though her characterization was a flat as a coca cola on a hot summer day. She didn't spark, she didn't have the strength of character needed. It I don't know if it her or how awful the script was. They never even attempted to explain Lisbeth other than she was troubled. No background was given. She was more of a freak brat with violent tendencies than the strong willed, brilliantly flawed, damaged woman she is the books/movies. She is supposed to not care about what other think, have a strong moral (even though they are her rigid morals) code and fiercely loyal. She is none of those things in this version. She actually asks permission to kill a man! WTF? She was actually told not to kill him in the book and she would damn well do I if she felt like it. I wanted to throw up when that happened. I cried at how bastardizated this version of her was and how unlike able she was portrayed.<br />Anyway, Daniel Craig was ok. He was no Michael Nyqvist but he was alright. Also flat and one note. Couldn't have cared less about him if I had tried.<br />The whole turning point in the book and Swedish movie is the rape scenes. This is supposed to be brutal and violent. Both the oral and later full on rape. It is suppose to help explain how Lisbeth is constantly victimized (esp earlier in her life) and how strong she is when she turns the tables. That should even be more shocking that her being raped. But in this movie it seems to be thrown it because it has to be included and it is not shocking or much of anything because we dot know or care much for Lisbeth because the writers/director hasn't made us care. Rooney is too stoic. Lisbeth was like a quiet storm. Even when she is not saying a word, she speaks volumes and yells it without a word.<br />To be honest besides the screwy plot and crap added from the second book that was weirdly thrown it and made no sense, this movie failed horribly. If you didn't know the story, then it is confusing. Heck I read the whole series and didn't understand this movie. But hands down the part that creeped me out the most was watching Lisbeth and Blomkvist together. It was weird. It made me feel dirty and I even threw up a little. It was nasty. There was no chemistry. It felt more like what I should have felt when she was raped but I felt violated for her.<br />This was not acceptable. These were not my beloved characters. This was a sell out and I am begging them to leave it alone and do not make anymore of the series. I beg you to walk away.<br />If you truly love the book, I encourage you to watch the Swedish version (regular or extended) and then you will see what this movie should have been. While it doesn't flow the book exactly, it also doesn't butcher the characters like this one.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I first listened to Adele back in 2008, I fell in love with her song \\"Chasing Pavements.\\"  She was little known at the time but I loved every song on the record.  Then, in early 2011, she exploded even further with the foot stomper \\"Rolling In The Deep\\", with the awesome video to accompany it.  I was just blown away -- Adele was a no-nonsense person and her fan base grew tenfold.  And I can see why -- her sophomore record, 21, is THAT good.  Beautifully crafted from start to finish, Adele took on different genres with each song.  Another foot stomper, \\"Rumour Has It\\", was a gale-force wind.  Her next hit, \\"Set Fire To The Rain\\", was even better sounding live (from the Royal Albert Hall record).  The next few tracks, \\"He Won't Go\\", and \\"I'll Be Waiting\\", are smart reggae.  With \\"Turning Tables\\", \\"Take It All\\", and \\"One And Only\\", Adele used some incredible lung power and knew how to deliver the goods, so to speak.  Next, Adele did a far superior cover of the Cure's \\"Lovesong.\\"  It's just way better than the 1989 original.  Finally, on \\"Someone Like You\\", you can hear Adele's voice emotionally (but brilliantly) break on the final chorus of the song.  She felt full of heartache but she made it into her own.<br /><br />Adele is one of those rare artists who can never do any wrong.  Although it could be difficult to have a follow-up as successful as this one, I sure can't wait to find out how she does it!  Go Adele, you truly ROCK!!!
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|I enjoyed all of the songs on the CD and they live up to Shania's reputation as a great Country singer.  I have some of her other albums but this is by far my favorite.

B00457WZEI|5.0|I really enjoyed this book from the perspective of the horse.  I wanted to read the book before I saw the movie.  It is well written and the author is skilled at storytelling. I am eager to read more of his books.
B000ESST6U|3.0|I appreciate one has to be Scroogelike to carp at this spirited production, magnificently conducted by William Christie and beautifully sung by so many talented and sparkling singers. But the very excellence of the musical performance--historically correct, idiomatic, deeply versed in the style of the period and the special pathos and nobility of Handel's genius--is a standing critique of Mr. McVicar's trashy and ignorant direction, with its gross and vulgar sensationalism.<br />I remember Christie's beautiful semi-staged production of Charpentier's Acteon, which dramatized the sexiness of Diana's nymphs bathing in their pool by having them each stick a naked foot out from beneath her gorgeous Fortuny gown into the imaginary water. You didn't have to have the special fetish of a Pushkin to feel the frisson. So why we have to have the pawing, the sexual mounting, the playing with perversity, and the wallowing in blood is beyond me.<br />I do understand the impulse to choreograph so much of the action of this opera. The music invites it; the stage tradition calls for it. So why did the director and choreographer make no effort to study the performance tradition--we know a lot about the choreography of Baroque opera-ballets by now--and try at least to incorporate its spirit into their routine?<br />Danielle de Niese presents a special problem, of course. She is so talented, not just as a singer but also as a dancer and a comedienne--and she is so filled with irrepressible animal magnetism--that it is hard to resist every conceivable excess if you are directing her, especially since it is probably hard to make her keep her clothes on. But one should let Handel be ones guide. He understood desire, but his grave nobility gilded everything in decorum.<br />Yes, I heard the roar from the Glyndebourne audience, and I believe in the market. If you can make Handel sell, more power to you. But Christie made Charpentier sell with just a naked foot--and in Brooklyn. Do we reallyhave to wallow to make this magnificent music-drama live in the 21st century?<br />For myself, I would rather just have a CD of this performance.
B006PZBRCY|2.0|Could not appreciate the whole movie due to HD quality resolution, I pay for HD and got less than regular DVD quality, very, very poor quality.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I went from the android to the iPhone, and this was one of my most used apps. I wish Apple could use it. Which makes no sense they can't, considering all music is downloaded to iTunes anyway.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I just got this on my Kindle and I love it. If you enjoy solitaire you need to get it. Very good!
B006Z7Z3R2|5.0|I saw this movie in theatres after having loved most of the director's previous film, House of the Devil. (I hated the ending of that movie, but think that it deserves another watch before I make up my mind for sure. Tom Noonan is so great in it.)<br /><br />This movie had such great, natural characterization. I laughed quite a bit even as the ominous notes came more and more frequently. As for the horror: there is a slow, building tension that suddenly breaks into a screaming run at the end, and it works better than any ghost story I've seen in a long time. And I like, too, that there is so much ambiguity. The circular nature of things (the locked cellar trap door being one that sticks out) make you question whether this is really happening or the protagonist is crazy. Neither interpretation diminishes the creepiness.<br /><br />I love ghost stories that understand that less is more, when it comes to explanations and showing the evil. The Others is another favourite of mine, and I think Ti West's Innkeepers is on the same level of quality.
0618918248|5.0|Do I need to say more? This book is just super! Very detailed and informative. If you are a person who still has many doubts regarding this matter, then go for it. And for those who live in the Middle East and arent sure if they can purchase this book: just order it as a gift. Works like a charm.
B005VTS4EY|4.0|Very entertaining.  Its challenging enough to keep me from getting bored but simple enough that I dint get too frustrated.  The simple graphics are great since it doesn't eat up my battery.
B00555X8OA|5.0|I saw the author's lecture on Authors at Google (on youtube) and, impressed with his presentation, bought the book.<br /><br />The content is as described. It is well-written and compelling without being technical--you see the cathedral without the scaffolding.<br /><br />I bought the Kindle edition and was 100% satisfied with the purchase.
B0075HO8P4|5.0|Birdy is probably one of my favorite artists so far. Her sound is really unique. This album has been out in the UK for a while now, so I can't wait until she releases her next one soon!
B004T2QZL8|1.0|Sorry this game was not at all stable on kindle fire.  It started out fun and I got to play for little while.  Then the game wouldn't stay open and kept getting the force close message.  Tried on and off over two days but it just doesn't stay on.  I tried - but ended up removing from device because it just is buggy.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|i absolutely love this game. super addicting. downloaded on my phone and my kindle fire. just wish i could get points faster to unlock new games quicker
B0063IH60K|4.0|functions good and plenty of options. can play for hours. difficulty veries from game to game.  I love the auto end.
B0045TYDNC|4.0|This is the new style rear cover. works as well as the old ones. Slightly different nylon, but seems pretty solid. Expensive for a little molded piece of plastic.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I understand all those who are touting this book as a realistic depiction of the tragedy of war, really I do. But if I wasn't supposed to be drawn into the subplot of romance, then why was that carrot so prominently dangled before me? I wasn't necessarily expecting or demanding a fairytale ending, what I was expecting was closure. After three whole books full of tension and build-up, what I got was a neat little paragraph claiming that my strong, independent heroine simply gave up and took the path of least resistance...I don't think I am asking too much for my author to keep Katniss in character, am I? What a horribly lazy and apathetic ending to such an enthralling work! (For which I still award 4 stars) It's almost as if Ms. Collins just ran out of artistic steam and decided to move on to something different so she wrapped things up far too abruptly; an understandable sentiment perhaps, but one which also shirks her responsibility to those of us who have taken this journey with her. Personally, I believe she owed her readers much more than she gave us. Even an actual conversation within the \\"climax\\" would have sated my need for something more than the enigmatic \\"anti-climax\\" I got. \\"Real, or not real?\\" \\"Real.\\"
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Very easy to use. Like keeping up with my notes and being able to finish later really help. Taking care of four grands doesn't always let me finish my notes.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this app is a handy and useful tool.... very easy to use and I really like the different versions that are available to help with studying.
0525478817|5.0|This book is honestly the best I have ever read. It made me laugh and cry, i couldnt put it down. It's not a cancer book. It may be about two teenagers who have cancer and friends who have cancer, it is not a cancer book. John Green is a brilliant author and a huge role model to me because i want to one day be as good as he is. I would recommend this book to anyone. I love it so much.
B004XZR63M|5.0|I've recommended this book to all of my friends. It is by far the best I've read in regards to finances.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game so much. it is really fun and an amazing passtime. my friends and I really really really enjoy it.
B003L20IFQ|3.0|I must say I enjoyed watching buried however it is a bit hard watching someone buried alive for a hour and a half though i get why they shot it that way. Over all the film was pretty good even if it tends to be slow at parts, its nice to watch something a little different. If your fan of Ryan Reynolds then this is a must see for you and I recommend it for a movie night or if its raining outside and you just want to stay in doors, either way im glad to add it to my collection of films. I give it a 7 and a half just because its a little slow but a must see none the less
0385344325|5.0|This is another excellent book in the Reacher series.<br />I was only disappointed by Amazon because they shipped me a copy of the book with a dark black magic marker mark along the bottom. This normally would not bother me, I have received other books with the same mark, but this was a full priced hard cover book. This type of mark on a discount paperback is not a concern. I did not purchase the book as an investment, but I am disappointed in the handling.
0061339202|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyable read. Packs with good advice on the pyschology of flow and its impact on everyday life activities and how to concentrate on them.
0307949486|2.0|Just finished reading the first two chapters.  I think the writer overlooked the rules of writing 101- capture the attention of your audience within the first paragraph, or something of the sort.  I hope Chapters 3 and beyond gets better.
B004T2QZL8|2.0|same thing over and over. did not enjoy. wasted about 20 mins before I just became too annoyed with the repetition of the whole thing. kindle fire. never made it past 15 elements so don't know if it would have force closed.
B004T2QZL8|3.0|Like everyone else, I was having fun until the force closes started to happen.  I've got a Galaxy S II Skyrocket.  Hope out gets fixed soon.  I am glad it was the FAOTD though otherwise I'd be pissed.
B003Y5HWMW|2.0|I'm not much into this fantasy lord of the rings crap , but when I saw the first episode I was pleasantly surprised especially when they show the creatures in the forest , but after that it just mainly became a snoozefest , who are these fanboys who get caught up with these storylines if they want to make a lord of the rings then go all the way and make it fantastical with creatures and monsters and magic and stuff like that , not just a bunch of people yapping about make believe , some episodes were just boring as hell , they say war is coming for the second season , I sure hope so
B004T2QZL8|3.0|hasn't force closed on me yet..<br />i think its a pretty good game, just wish i could get past 62 elements :/
B0071PS7AC|1.0|Poor graphics, very little settings to adjust, only one girl to play against. This game is a real dud. Not worth wasting your time on.
B0017SWPXY|3.0|I am not sure I quite understand why this book is so beloved? I get that the dog narrating the book makes it interesting and creative, but it still lacks so much in truly developing the plot that even this can not make up for the gaping narrative holes. It is very different from all other books, with most of the pages being dedicated to these crazy racing narratives that I had to skip over. Overall, it is a sweet tale of how one overcomes the death of someone they love but I could't get past the ridiculous racing methodology.
B00001X590|5.0|Joe Cocker announced his presence to the world with one hell of a debut album.  With A Little Help From My Friends is a strong and confident record that in many ways is peerless and impossible to classify.  It's not 100% rock; it's not 100% blue-eyed soul; it's not 100% blues; it's not 100% pop.  It is, I suppose, an amalgamation of all of these genres.<br /><br />Cocker, not known for his own compositions, certainly knows how to pick a good cover.  Highlights include Dylan's \\"I Shall Be Released,\\" and \\"Just Like A Woman,\\" as well as the album's titular song, a Beatles classic, for which Cocker is most commonly associated.  Yet the originals, written with the wonderful and underrated Chris Stainton, are also strong: \\"Change in Louise\\" and \\"Sandpaper Cadillac.\\"  There are two bonus cuts that are originals and a bit less remarkable.<br /><br />Still, this album is tremendous.  Jimmy Page's guitar appears on several cuts, as does Steve Winwood's organ.<br /><br />Great album.  Strongly recommended.
1451683405|3.0|Free Will is an excellent read by anyone interested in the free will debate.  I disagree with Harris on a number of issues and virtually all his conclusions, but he presents some worthy arguments against free will as he understands it.  That is the rub.  Harris' understanding of free will lacks some very important dimensions, beginning with the role of the intellect and the understanding of free will as derived from the power of an intellectual principle rather than mere matter.  Which brings us to the fact that Harris operates solely on the dogmatic belief that nothing exists except the material world.  In this regard he is a clear practitioner of scientism and does science a disservice since science should always be open to unforeseen possibilities, such as the existence of non-material reality.  Until Harris can prove spiritual realities do not exist (which is inherently impossible) he should refrain from flippantly dismissing them, especially when his own theory fails to account for important factors.<br /><br />Harris' examples of how a deterministic mind operates are valid only for those choices made without deliberation.  There are a great many decisions we make each day that are not \\"human\\" in the sense that they do not require the specifically human dimension of rational thought.  As Harris points out, animals think as well, but, as Harris fails to point out, they do not have conceptual thought.  If they did, they too would be engaged in mathematics and literature.  Animal thought has recourse only to specific examples of things.  In their minds they do not understand \\"men\\" or \\"cats.\\"  They always see a particular man or cat. When we say \\"kitty kitty\\" to a dog, the dog gets excited because it is recalling a specific experience with a cat.  We may get the dog to associate the term with other cats, but it is always associating it with specific experiences with specific cats, not \\"catness.\\"  They are not able to abstract the essence of what a thing is.  Conceptual thought requires the abstraction of essences.  We can think of such things as \\"beauty,\\" \\"goodness,\\" \\"truth,\\" \\"efficiency,\\" \\"diligence,\\" \\"circle,\\" \\"parallel,\\" and other such abstract concepts, that have no specific referent in the material world, because our intellects, unlike that of animals, have an intellectual principle that is spiritual in nature and able to go beyond the memory of specifics and grasp universals.  That is why whenever we visualize a concept it is always a particular example of that concept.  The concept itself cannot be visualized because it has no corresponding referent in the material world and is not \\"stored\\" anywhere like a memory; yet it is accessible to our minds because our intellects, having the nature of a spiritual principle, and not limited to material reality, are able to grasp universal concepts.  This frees us, when making choices through deliberation, from from the process of cause and effect engendered by material reality .  Harris' argument cannot account for conceptual thought and must, therefore, arrive at a deterministic view of human nature.<br /><br />Finally, I found Harris' arguments for the justification of a moral system based solely on determinism to be wrought with holes far too large to fill.  The last century saw numerous political and social systems based on a materialistic understanding of reality and they were the most destructive and murderous the world has ever known.  The reality is, any social or political system based on a materialistic view of reality will necessarily end in nihilism and self-destruction.  It is impossible to build a system of personal morality if \\"persons\\" do not exist, but only chemical reactions.  You may change the definition of personhood to include the \\"illusion\\" of personal existence as Harris suggests, but that will never serve to maintain an ordered society.  There is no way to escape the absolute personal powerlessness that results from a deterministic system based on materialism; Harris himself points this out very succinctly.  Harris fails to note, however, that individuals live and make moral decisions because they believe their personal existence to be real and in some way eternal.  There is a vast number of psychological studies which indicate this.  When that belief is replaced with the belief that their personal existence is an illusion, the basis of hope and moral order collapses.  Overall, Harris' argument was entertaining, but fanciful.
0756991145|5.0|This book is a little marvel.  On first glance it appears to be a fairly simple story about a young girl growing up on a South Pacific island with her mother.  But there is so much more here.  This story, in a minimalist way, shows what living in fear and in want is like.  The island where Matilda lives is under the cloud of rebellion.  There are two groups fighting, one group is the rebel group made up of local boys and the other group is the \\"redskins\\".  We don't learn much about these people, other than they are cruel and uncaring.  Life is very hard for Matilda and her small community.  They are suffering in the midst of this war that no one understands.  The children find it extremely hard, but along comes a saviour-a white man by the name of Watts- who takes over teaching in the small school and leads these children on a wondrous journey.  The Charles Dickens novel \\"Great Expectations\\" is what Mr. Watts uses to help teach these children some life lessons.  Matilda and her friends learn to look at life through Pip's eyes and to experience a life outside of their own little tropical island.  It also instills a lifelong love of words in small Matilda, and helps her get through some truly atrocious things. Such a lot of things for such a little book to bring forth, but Mr. Jones does it with aplomb.  This book is one that should not be missed by anyone who loves literature and reading.
B002WTC92E|5.0|If you don't like this book, you obviously don't appreciate the enjoyment of a light hearted fun read. No, this book won't teach you the lessons of life or how to find a perfect match, but it will give you a couple hours of sincere enjoyment. I think The Devil Wears Prada was fantastic; however, it was one of a kind, so to compare this novel to the author's classic rendition of a girl trying to struggle within NYC is crazy. This novel takes it up a step, targeting women who have already made it, for the most part, career wise and are now focusing on their love life. They are older and in a different stage of life from our beloved favorite character in the Devil Wears Prada. I appreciate the older humor and find it to be a similar spin off of Sex and the City without the focus just being on sex.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I love Evernote. I use it for notes at work and at home. I share notebooks with friends and coworkers.  Being able to use it from my work and home computers as well as my cell and my kindle makes it the perfect note app for me.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|It would be 5 stars easily if I could actually play it. I've been playing many times today and it just started force closing. Now I'm addicted and can't play! Update and fix please!!
B005HSG3VK|4.0|I would use it to protect the Kindle Fire. The prop thing it tell you to fold it dosen't work on beds and on tables it'll stay for 2 mins and fall.
0312323867|5.0|Blown away by this book! It is a must for everyone, especially if you love Emily Giffin books. This is my favorite book of hers because I found the characters to be very intriguing and the plot to be absolutely sincere and honest. I did not know how it was going to end, right down to the last page.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|i just beat the whole game!  lol so fun!  i adore it!  make sure to try this game out on the kindel fire!
B0052UZIFA|2.0|Used to be nice, but now that my sgs 2 has upgraded to ics it freezes after a minute or so. sounds similar to nexus problems. Buyer Beware.
1612130283|1.0|All you fashionistas out there should be in an uproar! Not only is this woman's vocab severely limited (she used the same phrases numerous times) but my sister who is a HUGE Christian Louboutin shoe fan (she owns a few pairs) could not believe that E.L. James misspelled his name. Lady, if you're going to use one of the top designers name in your books you have to get it right! It is Louboutin, not as you called it, Laboutin.<br /><br />I learned about these books like many readers from the morning shows(Today Show in particular for me)and I always thought they did their homework before they gushed about something on air. Now I know differently. If anyone of them had taken the time to read these books first, they would have been able to not only speak of her repetitious use of words, but the fact that she couldn't even get one of the world most coveted designer's name right. And if you live in New York, especially in the city where the Today Show is broadcasted from, then you bet they know who Christian Louboutin is!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I just finished the entire trilogy.  I found it to be dramatic, dark and captivating.  Overall, very enjoyable I would definitely recommend reading it.  I adored the characters and watching their relationship evolve.  I felt the book has the right amount of love, lust and romance.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|your game is horrible. freezes after a certain amount of elements are found. when people like you make a game you don't care if it is functional you just want money. hence you and your.games suck
B002N8A14M|5.0|This is the perfect armband/case combo for exercising! It's very sturdy, and I love the clip on the back of the case. Definitely a great purchase!
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I love this game its so interesting yet it keeps force closing. please please fix it please! this is one of those games that are just too cool to not fix
B004T2QZL8|5.0|Works great on my kindle fire. Addictive game. Give it a chance. Some good chuckles too :) Sorry the rest of you have crash issues...you are missing out.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its an ok.game not to.fun yet not to boring either its ok to play.it now and then. unlocking games.is a.little to much.
B0079R8KO0|5.0|Looks and feels great (leather like).  Design looks like it will last a long time.  Easy to put Kindle Fire into.  The ability to place Kindle at various angles is a strong point, watching movies and typing are what makes this cover one of a kind.  Get one, you cannot beat it for the price.  You will be glad you did!
B003SI84D6|2.0|Overall, you know the story.  Villans changed a bit, not better.  Ancillary plot lines not interesting. Big Hollywood over the top redo of simpler story.  Ridiculous mustaches. I much prefer a John Ford western.
B0073Q0DZG|2.0|Good story line but not very interesting. Hard to keep my attention.<br />Not much comic which is strange with Jack Black and Steve Martin
B005CA4SQK|5.0|Many of us, including myself, were disappointed when we opened our new Walking Dead 3 disc edition, selected play all, approached the middle of episode 2 and realized that the dismemberment scene had been cut. However after reading some reviews and replies to reviews I learned that if you do not select play all, and you select the episodes individually, the scene is there. Why is it like this? I have no clue. But the bottom line is that we can view the episodes complete and uncut if we just select them individually. Good thing, because I was getting ready to return it.<br /><br />So, having figured this out I can now say that the 3 disc Blu-ray version is the one to own.
B0067QPVD2|5.0|This is a great prequel to John Carpenter's The Thing. I havent read any of the reviews but I thought it had some of the same kind of gritty and gory details as Caprenters remake. Its worth a look.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I loved the graphics in thus game. I want to play it! but... it will only force close on me. I was excited, creating new elements, trying to speed through it. Then bam! Every time I try to create another element Doodle god forces closed. I guess the game wasn't meant to be :'(  I hope it updates soon!
B005H9B2CE|4.0|This was a well directed adaptation of the Thor story as I know it from my childhood.<br />Very well done with great FX and dailog. Can't wait for the Avengers with Thor and others.
1612130283|5.0|This book for me was a page turner I couldn't put it down. Yes there is alot of sex but you keep wanting to see what is going to happen to Ana....that being said I flew through the first book. The second book is even better goes deeper into Christian's life and they are learning more about each other. I can't wait to read the 3rd but am afraid for this all to end.
B004T2QZL8|2.0|so I have never had this problem before but I was trying to download the free version for the free paid app day. it will not let me download because of my address? I have never had this and I just downloaded free book. someone help me or tell me what is going on, I would.like to berths game free while I can and try it out. then I could also change my rating.
B0029LHX1W|5.0|The old adage states that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.  Few places and times would better demonstrate that saying than Stalinist-era Russia.  A country with a vicious totalitarian rule transformed normal citizens into monsters.  I'm not just referring to the serial killer at the heart of Tom Rob Smith's Child 44, but the \\"law-abiding\\" citizens as well, who were made to turn on each other for rather meager benefits.<br /><br />The hero of Child 44 is Leo Demidov, who, as the story begins, is anything but heroic.  Instead, he is an officer of the MGB, a state police force dedicated to stopping any sort of dissent.  Leo has a conscience, albeit a small one; it's enough for him to hesitate before arresting an alleged spy.  This hesitation will cost him dearly, creating a cascade of events that will end up putting him and his wife, Raisa in impoverished exile.<br /><br />During this exile, Leo realizes that a serial killer is on the loose, victimizing dozens of children.  In Stalinist Russia (or more technically, Soviet Union), normal crime cannot occur, because all citizens must be happy in the Worker's Paradise.  Therefore, the crimes are attributed to various insane people and the like and no one will acknowledge the links.  Leo will risk his life getting to the bottom of the killings.<br /><br />Smith does a good job showing just how much evil can come out of a totalitarian state, an evil that has even eaten into Leo and his marriage.  As Leo becomes a better person, he will learn that others can be good as well, though patches of benevolence may be no match for the viciousness of dictatorship.<br /><br />As good as the story is, I felt it was almost undone by the revelation of a relationship between two characters that seemed like an unnecessary coincidence.  I say \\"seemed\\" because Smith does a reasonable job justifying it, though I still felt it added a twist the book really didn't need.  Overall, however, this is a very fine debut novel,with great writing and interesting characters.
1451627289|5.0|I'm a huge King fan, and there is nothing I can add to the great reviews on these pages, the way King weaves all his stories together is simply amazing.  I would just like a to give a word of advice to anyone thinking of buying this book but is frightened by the negative reviews stating this is a over wordy long book not about a presidential assassination.<br /><br />Ask yourself a few questions, do you power through a book just wanting to get to the end?  Are you flipping to the end every 5 pages just to see how many more pages you have to read before you can finally move on to another book? What do you enjoy more, the journey or the destination?<br /><br />If you love the journey and the way a story can unravel in front of your very eyes then you will love this book.  One day after finishing it I wanted to pick it up and start over again, King always keeps you on the edge of your seat but he rarely tugs on your heart strings, this book accomplishes both.  I wish I could share more but I'd hate to spoil the fun.
B0063IH60K|5.0|it is very easy and fun to play...i love it! i like how you can change the background to be a photo from your album
0143119680|1.0|I am embarrassed I bought this book. It is pathetic. What was Amazon thinking when they chose it for Book of the Month ? Oh yes...money.<br /><br />One would think that if if an author had the guts to throw in a book each and every cheap trick in the profession, every cliché in the world, she would be able at least to write an entertaining story. Not the case. The only thing that is missing in the story is a werewolf. All the rest is there: vampires, witches, ghosts, a living house, the goddess Diana. But nothing, absolutely nothing happens during the first 3/4 of the book. The book is boring as hell.<br /><br />The witches and vampires remind me of X-Men mutants. They have powers like Superman, can fly, throw fire rays, you name it. But this is a 35 year-old woman who never wanted to know about her superpowers ! There is a lot of talk of DNA, and the creatures are considered superior to humans, who are weak, ignorant fools. At the bottom, this is a racist book, against the human race. There is even a race of creative, artistic fellows, the...demons !<br /><br />The love story, which comprises 99% of the book, is  boring. They just meet and immediately fall in love for no reason. No conflicts, no drama, no deep conversations. They just click. The vampire has the personality of a British robot. he reminds me of Arnold Schwarzenegger with fangs. The woman just adores him blindly. Before they met, she used to be promiscuous, career oriented, and suddenly she is like a 13 year old in love. It is just bad writing, the author can't build a plausible character.<br /><br />What can one say about a book where you find playing ghosts like in Casper, a house with a personality, like in the movie Monster House, and where the author literally uses a Deus-ex-machina trick by bringing the goddess Diana to help when all is lost ?  Give me a break. Not to mention that the book is completely politically-oriented, with a heavy new age tone, a lesbian couple, etc. The only thing thatis ok is the death of humans.<br /><br />In summary: this is a boring, pretentious book, full of cheap clichés, where nothing happens for hundreds of pages. Avoid it like the plague.
B0079KGAOY|5.0|Way, way back in the day, before a traffic pullover and then some breathlessly nflattering words, Mel Gibson was THE man. Mad Max, Braveheart, even Ranson, almost everything he touched was gold.  But Lethal Weapon changed everything.  The prototypical 1980s buddy flick, teams the unstable Mel Gibson with the stable family man, Roger Murtaugh, played by Danny Glover.  Whatever it was, these two had an absolutely magical chemistry on film that defied insanity, death and even bad scripts as the movies went on.  While the movies get progressively worse as they got bigger, with the exception of 2, Gibson and Glover propel this through sheer star power and will.  If you want to see two masters at work, doing what they do almost effortlessly, resulting in pure eye candy, check these films out.  They are a tad violent and a little sewer mouthed, hence the R ratings, but they are fantastic.  Add Joe Pesci to the mix, right off his Goodfellas role, and you got a great movie on your hands.<br /><br />If these are not the special editions, that would be too bad, because they are fun, but only the first one adds any real grabbers.  The scene where Riggs walks into a sniper's line of fire who was shooting kids is chilling and establishes Riggs' death wish quickly and brutally.  Modern post-Columbine sensibilities may find it hard to take, but it is an amazing scene.  All the other scenes are filler, but really fun filler.  If you can take a good hard R with lots of great comedy, this is a movie set for you.  Just remember it is a product of its times, and people were not as politically correct then.  These still stand out literally as some of my favorite films that I never get tired of watching.
B0055SWM08|4.0|very fun puzzles and keeps you going. I hope they make more games. Although they give you a lot of levels I whish there was more
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I LOVE THIS APP.BEST APP EVER.<br />It force closed a lot but somehow it fixed its self.<br />How do you play episodes?
B004T2QZL8|1.0|Looks to have great potential, but how to know for sure?  I'm running the most current version and it won't load past the 'loading' screen at the beginning.  Very disappointing and apparently isn't ready for prime time.  Fix the problems and I'll happily re-review.
B005LAIH2W|4.0|John Carter was a really good movie. I went and saw it with my wife and she also liked it. I am going to take my son to see it also. I can't wait to get the DVD!
B0018QOIXU|5.0|This first album by Adele is a hard one to beat her singing and music backup is worth the time and money to keep following her future.
B004SYP5WC|4.0|Helps to keep my bills organized. Would like to see a pie chart or bar graphs added in future update. Overall a great app.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|OK so I have never written a review, but this app has most certainly forced my hand. I read the reviews and thought that I would at least give it a try. I lived alchemy and I figured out very quickly that this was a clone. With that said I still like the layout and the art style that this version of the game has. Now I have noticed that it has been mentioned that the dev. has stated that updates will come if we keep the 5 stars rolling in. I am of the belief that you have to earn a perfect score not beg for it. I will gladly give this game a 4 and maybe even a 5 if and ONLY if an update is made to fix what I feel is a clear bait and hook bug that makes it so the game is unplayable after you start to get into it. Then saying that a patch will come if given a good rating<br />.. that's so not going to happen. I think that until we all see an update you should all go to alchemy. It is free and it has more elements.
B004T2QZL8|3.0|3/21/12 Good game... if u could play. Played for 30 minutes and now it foreclose instantly. Uninstall,reinstall no help. This was considered when rating.
B003ZDZ1WG|5.0|These young artists have really hit the right vein, and with this album this will be hard to beat in the future, but with their instrumental and vocals and the writing of their own music I am sure The Band Perry will pull out another great album in the future.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games is the best book I have read in years.  Every paragraph keeps your attention and interest. I can't wait to read the rest of the series.  I would recommend this book for anyone who likes a book that you just can't put down.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|I do not like it. It makes me very angery. It will not stop force closeing on me. Not a good app.
1439102732|4.0|This is probably my fifth Jodi Picoult book, and while I am definately a fan, I am a fan with certain, fairly low, expectations.  My main expectation is that she will pull her punches at the end (go for the happy ending).  She hasn't done it on all her books, but has when the topic is controversial.  This one tackled two difficult subjects, and she backed off at the end, taking the easy way out.  But it's still worth the read for her descriptions and understanding of what it means to be gay, and what it means to want a baby so bad you will do anything including destroying your life to get one.  I would suggest you stay away from the music, however.  The songs are awful and don't add anything to the story line.  The music isn't bad, but the lyrics are dreck and the singer sounds like a soloist in a high school chorus.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|With this Adele's second album it is easy to listen to and see why she got the 6 Grammy's and I am sure that she will get more in the future. She  is a great singer and artist.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game is great! Especially for the Kindle Fire. It works well and my husband and I just have hours of fun with it! You can't beat the price!!
0307949435|3.0|On its own and with the NPR review where I first heard the author, the ideas made sense. Further reading of the book and additional research left me unconvinced.Imay watch my carbs, especially sugar, but I'm not buying the whole package.
0385738773|5.0|I really loved it. It's pace was good, the twists were fantastic, it was tragic, epic, and just an overall great book.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|About 2 months ago I was here on Amazon looking for some new romance books to read. I really only ever read Regency period romances, but somehow that day 'Fifty Shades of Grey' caught my eye and lo and behold- six days later I had bought and read all three books- the entire trilogy. And let me tell you- I AM SO GLAD I DID! I love each book so much. I couldn't put them down. Christian's and Ana's story is really goooood. It's romantic, intoxicating, screwed up, steamy (x10!), emotional, dark, light, beautiful, and in the end- just perfect. ((((dreamy sigh))))<br /><br />Thank you E L James for these books! Thank you for Christian and Ana!!<br /><br />PS: Oh please write the story from Christian's point of view too. :-D
B007BDK3SS|3.0|To me, it seems as if the gameplay suffers from trying to make the game too technical. I enjoyed the longer sprints in the first game with big air versus the slow and techy types of tracks in this newest port. I paid for this game and was somewhat dissapointed. I would give it a 2.5 if I could and only rolled it up to a 3 because of my love for their first game. I hope they go back.
B005Y423ZC|4.0|Good entertainment. Adele comes through as talented and entertaining. Her commentary added alot to the songs but her 'earthiness\\" might put some off.
0385534639|4.0|This book gets a 4 for its vivid imagery. The author binds a spell (pun intended) with her words and brings to life a conglomeration of bizarre events and people.<br />A very strange book, but written in a powerful way.<br />Did I really understand what happened to the two main characters? Perhaps not, but the imagination runs wild.<br />Peculiar, but to call this a mix of Harry Potter and Hunger Games, would still not bring this to justice.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|I loved this app it was amazing but everytime I played it forced closed<br />awful<br />please do not get it
B0053O89WY|5.0|What a fantastic show. I really love how this show brings geeks and smart people to light. When this series began, I was very apprehensive to watch it and actually didn't watch in the begining. I started dabbling with the show in this season and began to really like what I saw. Naturally, I had to stop watching, pick up the previous season's DVDs and start in the begining. It was a pleasure. If you are just getting into the series, I suggest the same, start in the beginning. You will not be dissapointed.
B004T2QZL8|4.0|it is a wonderful game unroll it tells you to force close. it would have gotten a 5star rate but the force closeing.
B001H1SW4M|5.0|Clever, scary, and intense. This movie is sure to please those both into psychological horror and horror just for the fun of it. On top of that there is some great acting that is rarely found in scary movies.
B004T2QZL8|4.0|I really like this game nice graphics but after I played it for 10 minutes now it just force closes on my tmobile g2...please fix so I can give you 5 stars
1609611543|1.0|Eliminating gluten/wheat does not work if you do not have celliac disease or if you are not gluten sensitive.<br />I am cardiologist myself, and out of interest I decided to try this \\"diet\\".  So I eliminated all gluten from my diet and substituted it with almond flour.  At the end of 2 months, I actually gained 7 lb., probably because of high fat content in almond flour.  I did not follow his advice about not eating fruit, which is not related to wheat.  This book supposed to be about avoiding wheat and not about avoiding fruit so this did not make any sense to me. Fruit is very beneficial to us to just simply take it out of our diets.<br /><br />Now I am back to regular diet with wheat included and I lost 7 Lb.  I feel sorry that I wasted $10 for this very deceiving book.  As physician practicing cardiology I DO NOT recommend this diet (and book) unless you have celliac disease (less than 2% of population).
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|You really can't beat another cut the rope. second verse, same as the first, just more levels, more challanges, and even more fun!
B004T2QZL8|3.0|Fun puzzle game but it crashes constantly on EVO Shift. First time it launched, it ran for about 5 minutes but now after 20 to 30 seconds it will crash and need to be force quit
B006KSAPV0|5.0|Watching THE SKIN I LIVE IN makes you appreciate film again. Amazing, shocking, and entertaining movie, with an excellent performance by Antonio Banderas.
B003Y5H5HY|2.0|I repeat, I am not reviewing the movie-just the Blueray Special Edition package.  The movie is good-or else I wouldn't have bought the first day it came to DVD.  (I do find the Swedish version of Lisbeth to be just a tad more authentic/compelling, but that's just my opinion..lol).<br /><br />I purchased the Blueray special edition because (usually) it is the only copy offering a free download for computers/itunes.  Upon opening this package, I learned the \\"free download\\" can only be obtained by registering an account with Sony Pictures and THEN downloading it through their website. Per the instructions in the fine print (which could only be read after the package was opened and therefore unreturnable), the movie could be watched on an ipad by \\"simply\\" downloading a Pixster app (for who knows the cost) and watching it through there. Had I known I would have to go through all of this I would've bought the \\"standard DVD\\" version and bought a copy on itunes.  Now I have to go to itunes to purchase anyway so I can watch it on my ipad or Apple TV.  If I wanted to participate in Sony's \\"market research\\", I would've volunteered.  Now I've been forced to do so with the download serving as the carrot attached to a stick.  Lesson learned.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I think that some of the  games where you had to move with finger slides were rough but overall the games were fun and addicting.
B005K17RU0|4.0|This is the only weather app that I have used that is 99% accurate.. I love It... All the time!!!
B00127RAJY|5.0|After having a baby, I lost some of the weight quickly, this video helped me with the rest, and then some!  I never thought I would fit in my small clothing again, but I think I am in way better shape than before I got pregnant now and feel stronger than I have before.  I have been exercising 5-6 days a week and am on day 55 of exercise today.  I tried on clothing and was surprised that I am fitting in things that have not fit me in years.  I did 10 days of each level on this video, then moved on to ripped in 30 and am now using that video which I really like as well, and her 6 week 6 pack which I am only on level one of.  This dvd was a good starting point to getting back in shape for me and although I was still struggling with some of the moves (push ups, arm strength moves) I just did the best I could and tried to maintain good form and started to feel and see results pretty quickly.  Some days I really did not want to do it, but I just reminded myself it is only 25 min. and the time does fly by when you are actually doing it.  Now that I am seeing the results and feeling better I am finding working out with the dvd's quite addicting and I feel better on the days I make time to do it.  Love jillian and think she is a great motivator and highly recommend this dvd for getting in shape- inexpensive, and it works if you do!
B004O3YGMC|4.0|Splashtop remote desktop is a wonderful little program, it allows you to access your entire desktop or laptop through your mobile device. A little tricky to get adjusted to how your pointer responds to the touch screen but the trackpad feature is very nice, so far I have not seen performance issues from having to install the streaming client software onto my main computer(s) and when you sync splashtop with your Google.com account you can access your desktop from anywhere on any wifi network or 3g/4g. Easy to use and setup, was up and running in about 10minutes, for the price well worth it!
B00002N9ER|4.0|Installed brackets on a flat piece of board and mounted it on the wall behind a hall door.  Flashlight snaps into place very secure.  I wouldn't want to get too aggressive when snapping flashlight on because brackets are heavy plastic but still could break.  With proper care this mounting system should last perhaps a lifetime.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|my review for this app is further in this but I.feel.like I need to talk to the people who complain first. A. you need to rate these apps based on gameplay and your opinion not how well it works. B. it is okay to talk about it but when more than 100 people say it it gets annoying, people want to know how the app is not what happens to it. C. if you find an issue then you go to PRODUCT INFO and scroll.down and hit REPORT AN ISSUE WITH THIS APP instead of complaining.<br />My review for this is it is a fun app and requires thinking and guessing when you complete episode 1 which is finding everything possible you can play the mini games like run Santa run. it is fun and there was just an update that might have solved the force close problem but I will find out later. great faotd and fun if I bought it too. a must get
B004R13U6Y|5.0|Works great on my kindlefire. The only thing I would like to see is.dropbox and webdav support.Have it kinds like goodreader which is an awesome Pdt app for IPad
B007BDK3SS|5.0|This game is the best. It is simple and fun.Extreme is a fun word that means awesome.You don't have to sign your name or date of birth or anything. I have to say this game is great.
B004T2QZL8|4.0|It looks to me as if the latest update fixed the force close issue. Much more enjoyable to play now.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|would be better if it gave a little help on how to play some of the games but still incredibly fun.
0061992860|5.0|I bought this book because knowledge is something you can always take on any trip or during any situation. Just the section on improvising water purification alone, makes me feel like there is something I know that most people don't. It doesn't have to be the end of civilization or a zombie apocalypse for the information in this book to be useful. There are a lot of people, stuck in the aftermath of natural disasters or stranded in the wilderness because of a simple day hike, that could have found this information useful. If nothing else buy it , Just In Case.
B003R0MF5I|5.0|See if your friends and family have this, and other Chuck series.<br />See if there are re runs you can record to you favorite machine.<br />If no more free options, you have to buy.<br />You might say that is true for all other shows.<br />But this is worth paying for.<br />I was glued to my seat and watched again and again.<br /><br />I like other shows too, but this is the only one with<br />a good story line, and comedy, and worth paying for.<br /><br />You wouldn't be reading this if you haven't seen any Chuck.<br />If you haven't seen any Chuck, you don't know what you are missing.<br /><br />Almost all perfect facial expressions when they needed to express<br />that particular moment of worry, regret, happiness, stupidity, nerdiness........<br />There seems to be no limit on budget for Ms. Walker's outfits.<br /><br />And where did they get all those guns ??  Real or Fake ??
B004T2QZL8|5.0|This game is fun and addicting. I'm having a blast playing it. I just hope they fix the force close bug soon.
0061906220|5.0|I bought this book for my granddaughters, 2, 3, and almost 4 yrs old. They all love it. The two youngest especially. All three ask me to read it again and again. And all three, for some reason, when asked \\"did he cry?\\" answer YES every time. Then laugh when I say Goodness NO!. I made up my own tune before I listened to the original tune and the girls and I like my version better. They all sing along. The middle girl spontaneously sings the song whenever the mood strikes and she sings about whatever color shoes she happens to be wearing at the time. It's a very happy, joyful book.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|wasn't sure what to think of this game... bit it upon playing for a while... I began to like it. great time killer... but I usually end up handing it over to my son,who loves to play!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is a lot of fun. there are plenty of entertaining games to play and its very addicting. must download app
B006ANJ4BW|1.0|This movie did not live up to my expectations. Whoever did this movie has never read any of Robert E Howard's books.  Even Arnold's movie was better.  I certainly hope there isn't a Conan II in the works.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|There are so many games on this app and each and everyone of them are fun and help pass the time by and if you get frustrated with one game just play another one! I highly recommend this app.
B002JCSWV6|5.0|My husband wanted to see this movie. I'd never even heard of it but bought it for him. I thought it was a fantastic movie- very inspirational. And I would watch it again and again. I think it would be an excellant movie for young teens to watch to help guide them in to being forgiving, responsible, compassionate, and motivated to be better individuals.
B0034G4P4O|5.0|Wow! Now this was a real adventure! Old school meets newest school - and perhaps the penultimate achievement of CGI to date.<br /><br />I had so much fun screening this incredible production that it's difficult to compress into a short review. Obviously, others will likely do a plot synopsis and character breakdown, so I'll limit this to just my feelings and observations about Director Steven Speilberg.<br /><br />This seems to me the pinnacle of Speilberg's visions - having finally found the one medium that can truly express his artistic endeavors, his passion for adventure and drama; of reverent history and fond remembrance. While he'll always be remembered for his live-action films, and who can forget Jaws, Saving Private Ryan, The Color Purple, etc; in my opinion it will be his magic with children's stories that will perpetuate his long-term legacy. This film should, at least in my eyes, be the grand capstone to his incredible career.<br /><br />I'm so charged right now it's difficult to write! &lt;laughing> ;-D<br /><br />Suffice to say, this is what I've always believed CGI could accomplish when a competent guiding hand is on the steering wheel. This stunning film is what I suspect Zemeckis' syrupy sentimental '[[ASIN:B000Q7ZO8U Polar Express]]' and Cameron's infantile and ridiculously preachy '[[ASIN:B002VPE1B6 Avatar]]' was attempting.<br /><br />And proof that, if done correctly, computers can achieve something truly magical.<br /><br />I can't wait for the next chapter! Will happily pay my admission years in advance for another Tintin Adventure.<br /><br />Personal Notes:<br /><br />- Loved that there were shades of both 'Indy' in the soundtrack and the use of blended scene cuts - awesome!<br /><br />- Jazzed when his shooting star signature got worked into the story. &lt;g><br /><br />- Was completely floored when I saw, for the very first time last night, that the Laurel & Hardy of our times - Nick Frost and Simon Pegg - were in the movie! Holy smokes! &lt;laughing hard> X-D<br /><br />- Have to admit at being surprised that the filmmakers utilized \\"Tin-Tin\\" and not the phonetically correct Belgian of \\"Tahn-Tahn\\". Completely understandable, but it did initially throw me off. (my thanks to The Amazing Race for that tidbit) ;-Dlt;laughing hard> X-D<br /><br />- Have to admit at being surprised that the filmmakers utilized \\"Tin-Tin\\" and not the phonetically correct Belgian of \\"Tahn-Tahn\\".

B0063IH60K|5.0|Very entertaining when I find quiet time.  Just try it and I bet you will also enjoy playing.  Good luck its not as easy as it looks.
B0057O6IMS|5.0|Very affective, atmospheric, tense, lots of blood and gore, not for the faint of heart. I just watched it and I don't think I'll get much sleep tonight.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|My 9 year old son & I both love to play this game. The graphics are cute and engaging, the levels are challenging but not impossible.  It has saved us from boredom more times than I can count!
0316056871|5.0|If you're not a Tina Fey fan you probably will be after reading this book. This book had me laughing all the way through, I was in tears. Even my wife wanted in on the book when I was done after she seen how much fun I was having during this hilarious read. Fey even gives some great advice in the book beside some funny moments. i highly recommend it!! Plus I do highly recommend this great book that is also a really funny read!!![[ASIN:0983863016 How Desis Became The Greatest Nation On Earth]]
B004EPYZV2|5.0|Well I didnt like much of the MI III so I wasnt too excited to see the MI IV...but end up that this one is the best! GREAT MOVIE!
B004W2UBYW|3.0|As an IT person all my life, I just had to read this book. Everybody knows that the subject was an extremely talented and extremely complex personality. The book bears this duality out well, it is not a cautious \\"authorized biography\\". Lots and lots of positive and negative traits and actions are described.<br /><br />Why do I rate it for only three stars? Too many repetitions, too many words, too many minor details. I believe I now know about all the restaurants in Palo Alto and surroundings. Less is more, once again.<br /><br />I bought the Kindle version, downloaded it to my iPad - a nice experience.<br /><br />Steve Jobs was a great man, and as such he had great shortcomings. My son, an avid Apple fan during 20 years, has chosen not to read the book. He wants to keep the memory untainted.<br /><br />Rest In Peace.
B004T2QZL8|3.0|fun game where you have to think about what combinations will work. some combos are kind of silly but fun. played for about 10mins and it started to foreclose. restart the app and now I can prolly get 1 or 2 combos in before it forecloses on me. kind of unplayable now. *using HTC sensation*
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This review contains SPOILERS<br /><br />And the journey comes to an end......<br /><br />Honestly, this is the hardest of the trilogy to review. Ms. James really does cover a lot of ground in Freed and sometimes it seemed a little surreal. Christian does not loose his Fifty Shades (which I was so afraid of); she carries on the theme of the cover and title actually following the storyline; and Anastasia still has her doubts about her billionaire, megalomaniac, controlling husband.<br /><br />In Fifty Shades Freed, Ms. James tries to tie up all the loose ends bringing everyone full circle. Anastasia and Christian are working towards their HEA and are still tackling all the issues that they have with each other. We find out about Christian's past and his reactions when he really does not have control over a situation.<br /><br />The beginning of the book takes us on their honeymoon. There are some light and fun moments and one bondage scene where we go through Christian's regret of leaving marks (nothing permanent) on Ana. They return home to more intrigue with Jack and she finally brings everything to an end with him with Mia's kidnapping. The story-line's with Mrs. Robinson, Leila and Suzanne (a new sub that was never mentioned in the other two books) were also tied up. We faced Christian's fears with him and Anastasia's insecurities. There are some wonderfully romantic scenes and, as usual, the sex was hot. But, I did miss some of the banter between them that was in the first two books.<br /><br />There were a few scenes in the \\"Red Room of Pain\\" that were tastefully done. I enjoyed the orgasm deprivation scene, but, it was a little confusing. Except for the first book where Anastasia researches what a D/s relationship would be, there's no explanations of what he is doing or why. Ana safe-words in the scene only because she has no idea what he is doing. She knows he is mad at her but nothing is negotiated. I guess he forgot that she was never a Submissive and wouldn't understand that what he was doing was a punishment for disobeying him and not for her pleasure. The final scene in the Red Room was very touching.....Christian lightly flogging her while she was pregnant. I guess I never thought of a bondage scene being touching but, since this is not a \\"true\\" BDSM series, it fits.<br /><br />All in all, I actually loved the Shades Trilogy. It was a wonderful erotic romance. Anastasia and Christian were so easy to fall in love with.....you felt their love, pain and anguish throughout the books. Playful Christian just steals your heart and you want him to have a happy, normal life with the woman he finally gave his heart to. Even when he is being controlling and an \\"arse\\" you love him. It's his way of showing how much he truly wants and loves Anastasia. You feel Anastasia's anguish in trying to understand why Christian is the way he is....you go through her turmoil with her when she finally takes a stand against him knowing that she is pushing him to face his former life.<br /><br />As I previously stated, if you are looking for true BDSM, these are NOT the books for you. There are other series out there that give you the true meaning of BDSM if that is what you are looking for. (Kallypso Masters, Cherise Sinclair, Bianca Southerland, to name a few authors) Ms. James touches on the subject but, in my opinion, Christian is more of an Alpha Male with control and self-esteem issues than he is a Dominant (which is why it was so easy for him to slip back into his Submissive role in Darker).<br /><br />I give kudos to Ms. James for this being her first foray into writing. This was a very well written Trilogy with lots of love, romance and some steamy sex scenes. If there was any disappointment (besides not being true to the BDSM life-style) it would be in the \\"after thoughts\\" at the end of Freed. After the epilogue, there is an \\"Author's Note\\" that explains a scene in Freed. There are then 2 \\"Bonus Material\\" sections - Fifty's First Christmas and Meet Fifty Shades. Honestly, there was no reason to explain the scene from the Author's Note - it was implied in the book. Fifty's First Christmas would have been wonderful as a \\"flash-back\\" scene when he starts remembering his childhood. As for \\"Meet Fifty Shades\\", well this is Christian's POV from the beginning of Fifty Shades of Grey when he first meets Ms. Steele. Hmmm, interesting!<br /><br />I hope you enjoyed the reviews. Please remember, this is just my opinion and everyone has their own tastes in books. I enjoyed reading these from a reviewer's standpoint. Now, I think I will re-read them just for my enjoyment. So, I will end by Shades Trilogy reviews with my new favorite saying.........Laters, baby!ristmas and Meet Fifty Shades.

0307957934|3.0|Cast back to the recent past of May 6, 2010.  On the afternoon of that day at around 2:45 the U.S. stock market, already down 300 points, plummeted nearly 700 more in seconds, then rebounded to finish around 300 points down for the day.  Many, including the SEC/CFTC, offered explanations for the sudden drop and recovery.  However, even today, no one really fully understands the cause, itself frightening:  how do you cure a disease if you cannot ascertain with certainty its origin?<br /><br />Harris uses the startling and disturbing event -- the actual event -- as the climax of THE FEAR INDEX.  VIXAL-4, a hedging program developed by protagonist Dr. Alex Hoffmann, did it.  And guess what?  Just as an event like the Flash Crash likely will happen again, so will VIXAL-4, which might be VIXAL-nth by then, do it again.  Unfortunately, in the race to the denouncement, Harris tosses a lot of shopworn claptrap our way.  Too bad, because THE FEAR INDEX could have been a really terrific, much better exploration of some very intriguing and serious topics, among them the development and control of artificial intelligence, the primal drive of survival in sentient entities, the limitation of human intelligence (or the human tripwire, hubris), the dangers of mechanized stock and bond trading, and the ever popular greed.<br /><br />For me, and this may not be so for you, the problem arises in trying to examine these subjects in the context of a standard thriller.  Physicist genius Dr. Hoffmann breaks down when his CERN employer nixes his artificial intelligence experiment.  Fortuitously, against his grain, as he very much exists within himself, he attends a party where he meets his future wife, as well as a trader looking to branch out on his own.

B000MCH5TK|5.0|This movie has definitely grown on me.  I liked it the first time I saw it at a theatre, but the second time really grabbed me.  There were subtleties that I had missed, and I appreciated the acting much more.  Subsequent viewings have simply deepened my affinity for it.  It's not for everyone, but it is for me.  I would absolutely recommend this for anyone who has never seen it, especially if you enjoyed Traffic and/or Crash.

0465068367|1.0|Simply put, this book leaves much to be desired. The book is solely from the viewpoint of the Chinese. The author makes no attempt at hiding her disdain for the behavior of the Japanese soldiers in 1937, and continued on to take her tirade against the Japanese of today. The book went from bad to ridiculous. I lost faith in it 7% into it (Kindle version) when the author stated, \\"During World War II the infamous kamikaze suicide missions, in which Japanese pilots ceremoniously trained to fly their planes directly into American Aircraft...\\" While there were documented instances of Japanese planes ramming American bomber aircraft, why not state the very well known cases of kamikaze attacks against American and Allied ships?<br />I was angered by the author later in the book when she stated, \\"Anyone with half a brain was determined to get out while he still could.\\" She was referring to the Chinese who were attempting to flee Nanking. While I get the idea of people of any and all capabilities trying to flee the city, I felt insulted for the Chinese who couldn't flee the city. The old, the handicapped, the infirm, so because they couldn't, and maybe their families chose to stay behind with them, they have half a brain? It was a very poor choice of words by the author.<br />While I am in no way defending the Japanese during the Rape of Nanking, I do see the point of view of the Japanese after capturing Nanking and thousands upon thousands of Chinese Civilians. The author stated that the Chinese soldiers threw down their weapons, tore off their uniforms, and blended in with the general population. The Japanese then were faced with a huge number of people, more men than their army even. The author alluded to if the Chinese rose up and fought back, the Japanese would have been outnumbered. Since that wasn't the case, the Japanese were faced with a dilemma. They were an invading force faced with thousands of Chinese. Throughout human history, armies that conquered kingdoms andcities pillaged the entire area, killing every living thing. It's even mentioned in the Bible. That being said, what the Japanese did in Nanking is not unique to history.<br />Throughout the book their were numerous contradictions. In one example we are told that women who were in labor or after just giving birth were raped. But then we are told the story of a woman who told her Japanese captors that she had given birth to a dead child days before, so they didn't rape her.<br />The author references a Japanese document intercepted and deciphered by the United States on February 1, 1938 which the author uses to come to the conclusion that the death toll in Nanking exceeded three hundred thousand civilians. However, the document clearly states, \\"Nanking and elsewhere.\\" My other problem with this statement is, if in 1938 the United States is able to intercept and decipher Japanese secret messages - why were we unable to intercept their intentions to bomb Pearl Harbor? But this is irrelevant to the story.<br />The author continuously spoke of John Rabe being a Nazi. While their is no argument that he was a Nazi loyal to Der Fuhrer, I do think the author used his status as a Nazi to continuously portray an ironic twist to the story. The irony being a Nazi helping civilians, not murdering them in cold blood as they were doing in Germany. However, history has shown not all Nazi party members to be inherently evil.  The author appears to be unsure of Rabe's true feelings when she reported that his granddaughter stated, \\"...Rabe saw the Nazi Party primarily as a socialist organization and did not support the persecution of Jews and other ethnic groups in Germany.\\" The author then states dryly, \\"This may well be true.\\" To me, that statement sums up the author to me. She is unwilling to look past prejudice and stereotype. She sees all Nazi's, even John Rabe, as suspicious and evil. She sees all Chinese as victims. And she sees all Japanese as stubborn, evil, unapologetic people.<br />The author also appeared to try to make stories much more interesting than they were. Such is the case when the author tells us that the surgeon Robert Wilson nearly lost his life after a shell exploded fifty yards away. That is a substantial distance, unless we are talking a very large caliber shell - such as a naval shell. Since we aren't, it is hard to believe as the author continues on, stating \\"...Shattering the windows and spraying the room with shrapnel. No one was killed or injured...\\" Well of course not. The shell landed fifty yards away. That's not even a near miss. That's not even close.<br />The first instance of the author openly taking a jab at the Japanese occurs 41% into the book (Kindle version, location 1947 of 4724), when the author records the testimony of a man openly wondering if the destruction of Chinese property was a Japanese plot to, \\"compel the people of Nanking to buy Japanese goods later.\\" Very unlikely, and as such, this added absolutely nothing to the story.<br />A flow inaccuracy comes a few pages later when the author goes on to tell us the worst thing surgeon Wilson saw. But then one paragraph later, she tells us of an even worse thing the surgeon saw.<br />A confusing sentence comes a few pages after that, when the author states, \\"Chinese soldiers burned down the home of a twenty-nine year old woman in a tiny village south of Nanking... Before nightfall a Japanese airplane dove down at them, strafing the family....\\" So... Chinese soldiers burned down a chinese house? Or did the author mean Japanese soldiers?<br />Then the author states that the surgeons and physicians in Nanking went to Shanghai every weekend to recover from the strain. So even though surrounded by thousands of Chinese casualties, in the middle of a warzone, during an occupation by Japanese soldiers who are reportedly roaming around shooting people and raping women, these doctors can just up and leave the warzone, head to Shanghai for the weekend, and thencome back? That just sounds ridiculous.<br />The author continuously praises the Safety Zone leaders for acting bravely to save the Chinese. While their actions are worthy of praise, the author is a bit overzealous in her stories of their deeds. I find it hard to believe that the Japanese would sit back and not do anything when these Safety Zone Leaders, \\"Threw themselves in the line of fire, wrestling chinese men away from execution sites, knocking Japanese soldiers off of women, even jumping in front of cannons and machine guns to prevent the Japanese from firing.\\"I just find it hard to believe that a conquering army such as that composed of the Japanese, who the author makes out to be brutish and soulless, would allow these people to so openly throw themselves in front of guns without the Japanese 'accidentally' pulling the trigger. To me it shows the Japanese had restraint, which is a contradiction to what the author is stating throughout the book.<br />The author lost me when she argued the Japanese censors purposely took out a scene of the Rape of Nanking in the movie, \\"The Last Emperor\\" as proof that they were unwilling to admit to the Rape of Nanking. The Japanese themselves stated that they took it out for being too sensational. I agree with the Japanese. Just as an example of Japanese morals when it comes to movies, the old classic, \\"Godzilla\\" has the equivalent of an R rating in Japan.<br />Finally, the author completely lost all my respect when she began her rant stating that, \\"Those who ignore history tend to become its victims,\\" implying that Japan, because they will not apologize for their actions in Nanking, will someday rise up once again and declare war on all of Asia again. \\"No one thought that Japan would become the foremost economic power in the world - but they are. If you give them the chance to become a military power - they will become a military power.\\"<br />Call me cynical, but I believe this to be sabre rattling at its absolute worst. The author wanted to present the Japanese in the worst light possible, and finally worked herself into a fervor and then claimed that someday Japan will rise up and do what they did in Nanking all over again. Give me a break.<br />I didn't even get into all the paranoid extremist Japanese death threats and all of that, but take my word it. If you want to learn about Nanking, skip this book. Contrary to the author's belief that history has all but forgotten Nanking, just type in, \\"The Rape of Nanking\\" into Google, and you'll find thousands of informative articles.
0812992792|5.0|I listened to the audio version of this novel.  I would highly recommend that medium,as the narrators really added to the drama.<br /><br />I just finished the book last night and of course I dreamt about the final scenes in the book that night. Assuming North Korea and North Koreans live anything like how Mr. Johnson imagines them living, it's just such an upsetting scenario to contemplate.  But, he does a wonderful job of making his characters real and sympathic.  You want to dislike them all, but it's not possible.  And you come to understand the seemingly unbelievable choices they make.<br /><br />This is a novel that will stay with you long after you read it and you will think more about people who have to endure living their lives in North Korea after you've read this book.  How do they cope?  How do they find any love or happiness?  How can the rest of the world not care?
1593082037|5.0|Excellent stories and excellent characters! Why have I not read these before?! They should be a part of some high school or literature course somewhere. Americans really should take more British authors seriously. There are only so many plays of Shakespeare and so many novels of Jane Austen to choke over. I find the title kind of funny though: \\"The Complete Sherlock Holmes: Volume 1\\". I would hate to see the size of the book that contained both volumes.
B003EYVXV4|5.0|The very best of science fiction tends to be memorable for more than just robots, space ships, and dystopian future. What makes them remarkable are the litany of ideas and concepts , both large and small, presented throughout. And if you can do that in a way that looks cool and is entertaining, then so much the better. It's one reason why 35 years later we still admire Star Wars, and why Hollywood continues to try and emulate it. Suzanne Collins' The Hunger Games trilogy of novels falls into much the same category, a sprawling, epic adventure with social commentary to spare and a lead hero in Katniss Everdeen(Jennifer Lawrence) everyone can relate to. Yet people were justifiably worried about how that scope would be presented on the big screen, because more so than Harry Potter or Twilight, the exclusion of any single element could topple the immaculately constructed balance between fantasy and brutal realism that Collins constructed.<br /><br />There is little reason to fear, Team Gale and Team Peeta fans. The Hunger Games is everything a loyal reader could ask for, but more than that it's the type of film that promises a truly epic franchise in the making. With studios looking to adapt every semi-popular novel with the hopes of creating the next Twilight, few of them ever turn out to have the complexity and depth of character to stand the test of time. The Hunger Games is diverse enough to appeal to the broadest possible audience. There's enough of a love triangle to have people rioting in favor of Team Peeta or Team Gale, yet the action is equally intense and effective without being overly graphic.<br /><br />Credit immediately goes to Gary Ross, a seemingly odd choice for director who turns out to have been a perfect fit. Best known for Capra-esque movies like Dave, Seabiscuit, and the visually stunning Pleasantville, Ross is essentially doing the opposite of everything he's done before. The deep, textured story begins with a simply worded prologue, introducing us to the line of thinking that allows for something like the Hunger Games to exist. Taking place in the fictional realm of Panem, where the ruling Capitol lords over 12 separate districts, each poor in their own way but working to sustain themselves and the government. District 12 has had it the worst, a mining town that looks chillingly like the squalor of Winter's Bone, Jennifer Lawrence's big breakthrough performance. She plays a similarly strong, fearless young woman with a family completely dependent upon her. Katniss dotes on her younger, more fragile sister, Prim(Willow Shields), and does the work their mother seems incapable. To escape the burden of her life, Katniss occasionally scales the barrier fence into the restricted wilderness to hunt alongside her best friend, Gale(Liam Hemsworth), who has dreams of running away with her to start anew elsewhere.The hopelessness of their situation is made more stark by the decadence of the Capitol, which we see in quick flashes of brightly colored hair, an unending supply of food, and garish architecture. Meanwhile the people of District 12 look at bread as a rare delicacy.<br /><br />Any hope of escape is quickly dashed with the Reaping, a twisted lottery event held each year to select a boy and girl from each District to compete in the Hunger Games. The youngest have the fewest entries, while the oldest like Katniss and Gale have many, increasing their chances of being picked. When Prim has her name drawn, Katniss does the only thing she can think of to save her sister, and that is volunteer to take her place. The dramatics of the situation only brings a smile to the face of the flashy Effie Trinket(Elizabeth Banks), just the first taste that these games of literal life and death are seen merely as entertainment for the ruling class.<br /><br />Katniss is soon joined by Peeta Mellark(Josh Hutcherson), a quiet and fiercely confident boy she shares a mysterious past with. A few rushed \\"good-byes\\" later and the two are quickly taken to the Capitol for training. Not just in the deadly arts they'll need to survive against 22 other \\"Tributes\\", but mainly in showmanship. Their mentor, Haymitch Abernathy(Woody Harrelson), is a survivor of the Games and butts heads with the gruff Katniss over her inability to make friends and impress potential sponsors. Peeta instantly takes to his new found celebrity, using it to make a stunning revelation on national television that forces everyone to fall in love with the two poor combatants from District 12. While this would please the toothy, pearly white grin of talk show host Caesar Flickerman(an inspired Stanley Tucci), it would draw the unwanted attention of President Snow(Donald Sutherland), who has a malicious vision for the Games that would send a chill up Darth Vader's spine.<br /><br />Looking back on when The Hunger Games was just entering production, one of the great debates was who could possibly take on the Katniss role in a believable way. Some felt Gary Ross needed to aim younger, but the decision was made to select the red hot Jennifer Lawrence, and it was a decision that proved to be the right one. She is simply phenomenal here, capturing some of that awkwardness of youth, but also showing a real strength and resolve of someone who has seen too much for someone of her age. The search always seem to be on for a new heroine that girls can look up to, and unfortunately too many of them have flocked towards Twilight's Bella Swan, even though she is a character who is who she is because of the guys in her life. How interesting would she be without a wolf and a vampire fighting over here? Not much. Katniss is different, and whether we ever saw Peeta or Gale and the inevitable squabble for her affections, she would still be a character worth following. She's incredibly likable, smart, and tougher than even her male counterparts. Katniss is a character every girl can actually look up to, genuinely one of the most fully realized movie characters of any gender.<br /><br />The rest of the cast is superb, as well. In particular Josh Hutcherson, who many(including me) felt didn't have the look or the natural presence the Peeta role demanded. He proves to be more than up to the task, showing flashes of real charisma in his verbal sparring with Stanley Tucci, and leading man charm when together with Lawrence. Lenny Kravitz is dead on perfect as Cinna, Katniss' stylist who sees her as more than just tool in the Capitol's games.<br /><br />How does the film compare to the book? Well, as with any adaptation there are some characters and story elements that need to be dropped. Ross, along with Collins and Billy Ray as screenwriters, have managed to maintain the story's integrity while cutting down some of the extraneous portions. One of the book's prevailing features was that it was seen entirely from Katniss's perspective, and they've managed to capture her internal monologue on screen, mainly thanks to Lawrence's emotive performance. There are some portions of the story that are intentionally glossed over, likely because they will become bigger factors in the sequels, which are already in development. Lionsgate knows they have a hit on their hands, so why wait? This is a minor quibble, and can looked past because the allegorical elements are so on point. This is what happens when our celebrity obsessed, reality TV culture goes too far. It bears some striking resemblances to a film called Series 7: The Contenders, in which people killed one another off in a highly rated television show. The easy comparison many have made is to the controversial Battle Royale, but the two aren't saying the same thing at all once you get past the surface similarities.<br /><br />Those who might have been turned off by the extreme amount of hype swirling around the film need to put all that aside and just see the movie. This is without question one of the best pieces of science fiction we have seen in years. By comparison, TheHunger Games is a better opening salvo than Twilight and Harry Potter delivered by far, and the potential for this to to be a significant, celebrated franchise appear to be forever in Gary Ross's favor.aracters of any gender.<br /><br />The rest of the cast is superb, as well.

B0042GIRYE|4.0|I'm a fan of the Zac Brown Band and this set is a good example of their versatility while staying true to their basic music.  There are upbeat, enjoying life songs along with ones to make you think about what's important in your life.  It's a great relaxation set of sound tracks.  Enjoy!  I do.

B005LAIGP0|5.0|I really liked it actually! I heard it wasn't getting good reviews, but I don't know what those people expected.<br /><br />It was a good horror movie! It wasn't filled with gore and faux-blood spillage everywhere, but it was scary and perfect to bring girlfriends (but prepare for high pitched shrieks)!<br /><br />I brought my brother along and he thought it was very scary! And he's a horror movie buff! Just for the record, my brother wasn't cowering in a corner, he meant 'scary' as in 'well-done' for a horror movie.<br /><br />That being said, none of the scares were new ones, but they were very effectively used and that's better than most horror movies and movies in general.<br /><br />The acting was great; the cinematography was great, it was both beautiful and desolate on Isle Marsh; the spooks weren't original but well-done.<br /><br />The clothes were amazing. Daniel Radcliffe should wear something like this all of the time and he will never have to worry about going home alone ever again.<br /><br />It felt like a short movie, which is great because I think it's close to two hours long.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed myself, I feel as if my hard-earned cash was spent properly, and I would definitely subject myself to this movie again!<br /><br />As of now, I shall just have to content myself with reading, \\"The Woman in Black\\" by Susan Hill, the book on which this movie is based.
B005LAIGRS|3.0|It's been a long time since there's been reason to be excited over a Denzel Washington movie. Ever since his Oscar win for his heelish turn in Training Day, the actor has mostly been content to coast along in exciting, but not terribly challenging thrillers alongside bland co-stars. It's like someone is constantly trying to find a way to recreate the Training Day magic between Washington and Ethan Hawke. Denzel is always the coolest guy in the room, the one with the confidence and steely reserve that everybody else in the movie lacks. His smile indicates he knows something nobody else does, and there's never really any doubt he'll succeed. That same formula is employed yet again in Safe House, but with an abundance of style thanks to Swedish director, Daniel Espinosa, that makes this an intense thrill ride worth checking out even if feels a touch familiar.<br /><br />Washington's muted co-star this time is Ryan Reynolds, playing bored, untested CIA agent Matt Weston. Matt has pretty much everything he could want: a supremely hot girlfriend who adores him, equally unfair good looks himself, and a cushy position house sitting a safe house in the heart of Cape Town, South Africa. That's not enough for him, though, as he yearns to step out into the field and really earn his stripes.<br /><br />The phrase \\"Be careful what you wish for\\" comes back to bite Matt in the rear end when ex-CIA agent turned international terrorist Tobin Frost comes waltzing into a nearby embassy and turns himself in. He's got something that has kicked up a violent hornet's nest of activity, with all the world's assassins looking to put a bullet in him and take it. What is it? Doesn't really matter, and the script doesn't seem all that concerned with it, either. The only thing that matters is that Frost can't go anywhere without someone looking to put a knife in his back, and even the CIA safe house he's holed up in is stormed by armed killers.<br /><br />Frost hardly seems phased, even as he's forced to go on the run with a green as grass agent like Weston. Actually, Frost seems to revel in the experience gap, twisting Weston's mind like a pretzel even as he fights for his life, surviving one ridiculous shoot out or car chase after another. Not even the threat of waterboarding seems to phase Frost, as he's more concerned with the type of towel being used on him. His calm, while fun to watch thanks to Denzel's icy charms, is also a little irritating considering the seriousness of the situation<br /><br />The heavily lauded script by David Guggenheim lacks sufficient twists and witty banter, and you'll see the big swerve coming from a hundred yards away. How it landed on the Black List, Hollywood's annual selections of the best unproduced screenplays, is beyond me. The pace remains at a breakneck speed throughout, but what you want is more of Frost spinning Weston's head like a dreidle. We just don't get nearly enough of it, and too much of the rather weak mystery of a corrupt official within the CIA. What? A corrupt government agent in a spy thriller? Surely you jest. Vera Farmiga and Brendan Gleeson are wasted in this go nowhere subplot, which pans out exactly as you think it does. Ryan Reynolds is just over matched in every conceivable way opposite Denzel. While it's good to see him not playing the wise cracking pretty boy for once, his character is too weak to shine.<br /><br />It's amazing how every Denzel Washington film ends up looking like Tony Scott-lite. Daniel Espinosa, who showed he's a talent to watch after his nervy crime pic, Snabba Cash(known here as Easy Money), initially falls into the same category before settling into a serious groove. His style remains kinetic and and a little crazy at times, but he manages to find moments of calm where Scott can't stay on any scene longer than two seconds. The firefights brutal hand-to-hand brawls have a Bourne Identity feel to them, dizzying and visceral.<br /><br />So it's another solid outing for Denzel, one he can do in his sleep.The film will get your blood pumping, and might even make you laugh once or twice. It just could have been a lot better, with a stronger co-star and better script. Now if only Denzel would leave the safe house his career has been shacked up in and take some risks.zel, one he can do in his sleep.The film will get your blood pumping, and might even make you laugh once or twice.

B005LAIGWS|3.0|No other character in the Marvel Universe is more suited to the manic, bipolar antics of Nicolas Cage than the Ghost Rider, which is why the 2007 film turned out to be so disappointing. Directed by Mark Steven Johnson with all the flair of dry toast, all of Ghost Rider's most unique genre attributes were frittered away in a bland attempt to follow in the phenomenal success of Batman Begins. With Johnson mostly out of the picture, the rapidly produced sequel gets a much needed fuel injection with the twin duo of Neveldine/Taylor behind the camera, bringing with them the same chaotic energy that led them to success with both Crank movies.<br /><br />Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance is a more complicated beast, and for the most part Neveldine/Taylor are up to the challenge.  More in tune with the character's dark, pulpy roots, the supernatural grindhouse feel will be a welcome reminder to fans of Cage's underrated Drive Angry.  After a brilliant, Mignola-esque animated sequence zipping us through Johnny Blaze's deal with the devil that transformed him into the Ghost Rider, we learn he's been hiding out from civilization out in eastern Europe. His hopes of keeping the demon inside him locked away are quickly dashed with the arrival of Moreau(Idris Elba), a gun toting, hard drinking warrior monk who warns him of the Devil's(Ciaran Hinds) plan to attain a new host body. To do it, he'll enlist another damned soul named Carrigan(Johnny Whitworth) to kidnap the son of Nadya(Violante Placido), a woman he also struck an ill pact with. The Devil is a hell of salesman, apparently. He's always closing. The promise of eternal redemption is all Blaze needs to sign on for his most dangerous mission yet, playing the unfamiliar role of protector.<br /><br />With a trimmed down budget, this version of Ghost Rider has a tougher, meaner look to it. The lack of polish makes the flame-headed biker all the more visceral and terrifying, especially when he's got some poor thug in the grip of his soul destroying \\"Penance Stare\\". The action scenes should be where the film really shines, but unfortunately the directors don't go far enough. While some of it is pretty awesome to behold, like when Ghost Rider jumps in a giant construction vehicle and lights it with hellfire, others are uninspiring.  Undoubtedly they've got a better grip on what makes the character tic, but you expect Neveldine/Taylor to go absolutely ape dump on a movie like this, and sometimes it feels like they held back.<br /><br />Essentially shot in exactly the same manner as Crank, it's when the Ghost Rider is on the open road that are the brightest spots. Sure it's a little dizzying with all the jump cuts, speed ramps and other crazy camera tricks the directors typically employ, but it works to give the film a distinctive look. Even during the rare times when the action slows down, there is rarely a dull moment. A self aware sense of humor, such as when Ghost Rider starts urinating hellfire, occasionally works but often feels a little forced.<br /><br />Cage gives the sort of performance you'd expect for a movie this insane. He's constantly \\"on\\", flashing his teeth at every opportunity and always looking as if he's about to snap and jump off the cliff or something. While that may not work as often as he employs it, that's exactly the mode Cage needed to be in for this role. What's more entertaining is Idris Elba, who appears to be trying to match Cage for scene chewing honors. His chatty, wobbly Moreau is a total 180 from the strong and silent guardian he played in Thor.<br /><br /> While it's not a great movie, fans of Ghost Rider will leave the theater far happier than they did five years ago. There's still a better film to be made, and perhaps it'll happen in a few years with a slightly better script.

B004QL7K6G|2.0|Paul Rudd must have a particular fondness for hippies because he seems to love either playing them or playing off them. They make for relatively easy laughs and breezy comedies, similar to Rudd's performance as the free-spirited moron in last year's Our Idiot Brother. Hippies are fun, and they make for relatively soft targets for a likable actor like Rudd. Wanderlust, the latest comedy from the Judd Apatow umbrella, has Rudd paired up with a familiar face in Jennifer Aniston. Even though the two haven't done a movie together since 1998's The Object of My Affection, they spent plenty of time together on the set of Friends. Their chemistry together is on point, and the bulk of the film's laughs come between one another. Separately, Wanderlust succumbs to a drowsy script that can't overcome the slight plot.<br /><br />George(Rudd) and Linda(Aniston) are a seemingly happy married couple devoted to the idea of setting up their lives in bustling New York City. He's a businessman of some sort, while she just seems to be drifting from career to career. At this point she wants to be a documentary film maker....about penguins with terminal cancer. It doesn't go well. But their commitment is strong, and are pushed by a hilariously unscrupulous real estate agent(Linda Lavin!!) into buying a high priced \\"micro-loft\\", which turns out to be a closet sized studio apartment. George almost immediately loses his job, whatever it was, and unable to afford the lifestyle, they find themselves headed to Atlanta to stay with his scummy but successful brother(Ken Marino).<br /><br />Disaster strikes during the interminable road trip, in the form of a hairy nudist(Joe Lo Truglio) and his floppy man sack chasing them into a freak accident. Forced to stay at the ironically named Elysium Bed & Breakfast, they discover that it's actually a hippie commune, or as its leader Seth(Justin Theroux) calls it, an \\"intentional community\\".  The big city folks quickly fall in love with the relaxed nature and the close-knit bonds forged among the denizens, and after a wild night of drinking, pot smoking, and being treated like beatnik royalty, George and Linda feel they've found a new home.<br /><br />No more stress, no more reliance on technology, and no more barriers.Basically every hippie joke you can think of becomes an instant factor, whether it's farm animals turning up in the oddest places, wacky acid trips, and shocking infringements on one's personal space. It's all stuff you've seen before, but Rudd and an excellent supporting cast do their best to make it work. You know from the start that Seth has his eyes on Linda, who is acclimating to the group better than George ever could hope to. You know where it's going, but Theroux shines as the manliest guy in a town full of pacifists.<br /><br />Rudd nearly saves the day, however, especially as George's perceptions of the group begin to shift from enthusiastic follower to caustic observer. Tempted by a free lovin' sex pot(Malin Akerman), George is willing to give up good food, bathroom privacy, and his favorite local coffee to give the lifestyle a shot. If only Rudd help from a better script, one which wasn't so devoted to skit show cliches. Too often the film feels razor thin, like screenwriters Ken Marino and director David Wain came up with the idea on the fly to do a hippie movie, but never got past the conceptual stage. Basically, it's like they just assembled a talented group of comedic heavyweights and said \\"Have at it\\". Not everybody is capable of making chicken salad out of chicken crap the way Rudd can, and unfortunately too many scenes don't work for that very reason. It's sad to watch the great Alan Alda wasting away with a one-note bit that is never funny, yet repeated over and over again as if we'll suddenly change our minds about it. Sometimes that works, but not often.<br /><br />A look at the trailers for the film show a number of scenes that were apparently left on the cutting room floor, whichmakes the inclusion of some of the worst jokes utterly confusing. George's excruciating, profanity-laden attempts to psych himself up for some guilt free sex is a serious low point. It's only matched by a mother who gives birth to a baby right at George's feet, then proceeds to lug the placenta around like luggage. Why is this funny?<br /><br />Nearly all of the offensively lame attempts at humor come in the second half of the film, when it appears that Wain and Co. basically threw in the towel. For the first hour or so, Wanderlust moves at a solid pace, letting it's two charming leads tell what was a clever fish-out-of-water story. Too bad it all vanishes in a puff of smoke.makes the inclusion of some of the worst jokes utterly confusing.

B005LAIGYQ|2.0|In 2007, around the time that Act of Valor was first being kicked around by the Navy, the military was experiencing the lowest recruitment levels in their history. It was so bad, that within a few months they would be lowering the entrance standards to historic levels. Something had to be done, and since they already had directors Scott Waugh and Mike \\"Mouse\\" McCoy on the payroll shooting recruitment vids, it made sense to use their talents in what would essentially be a feature length commercial that would feature real military grade equipment and active duty Navy Seals.<br /><br />It's not the worst idea in the world. John Ford made propaganda movies for the military during WWII. Although Act of Valor probably would have disappeared into the dustbin of movie history if not for the arrival of Seal Team 6 into the national consciousness. Their high profile capture and disposal of Osama Bin Laden had every studio clamoring for a movie on the prized military unit, and in June of 2011 Relativity bought the rights to Act of Valor for a whopping sum, especially when you figure there isn't a single big name star attached.<br /><br />With all that build up, Act of Valor digs itself into a pretty deep hole right off the bat, with the directors explaining to us in detail just how authentic their movie is compared to others. To their mind, and that of the Navy apparently, no actor can adequately carry out the physical and emotion tolls. Their movie is different than everybody else's. A perfectly fine position to take if actors were being asked to actually go to war. But as it turns out, soldiers can't carry the emotional and physical tolls of...well, acting. Even worse, McCoy and Waugh prove themselves to be exactly what they claim not to be in the beginning, which is just another pair of Hollywood directors pulling the exact same stunts. What's the difference between these two and the Crank duo of Neveldine/Taylor? Oh, Neveldine/Taylor have a signature style, that's what. McCoy and Waugh look like they studied at the Peter Berg School for Michael Bay Imitators.<br /><br />The story actually kicks off with an unsettling bang, with a suicide bomber in Jakarta using an ice cream truck to lure dozens of children into the blast radius. Confidence that we may be privy to a more realistic, less glamorized approach is bolstered by the matter-of-fact nature of this disturbing scene. The incident is the tip of the iceberg, of course, with a deep cover agent(Roselyn Sanchez) investigating the terrorists beaten and taken hostage, forcing the United States to call in the heavy hitting Navy Seals for a snatch 'n grab operation that soon explodes into a full on war against terror.<br /><br />It's at this point we're introduced to the brave men(no skirts on this squad!) we'll be following for the course of the film, mostly through some terribly dry and plodding narration giving us the most basic introduction to the team as possible. Part of the reason could be to emphasize the unit rather than the individual, which is understandable, but that idea is nixed with the stilted attempt to show a close-knit and deeply personal bond between Dave and Lieutenant Rorke. We see the entire unit and their families hanging out on the beach, the men saying tearful good byes to their families before deployment on this dangerous mission. Using the soldiers and their real life families proves to be a major mistake for a number of reasons, but the most significant is that it's hard even for the most well trained actor to play themselves. In an instance like this, what we get are soldiers and their wives acting out how they wish to be portrayed, rather than just being natural. It comes off as stiff and resoundingly inauthentic.<br /><br />All the while this is being backed by the narrator, making vague allusions to bravery, honor, and courage. Great ideals to uphold, certainly, but the guy reading it sounds like somebody forgot to remove the bolts from his head. It's just macho talk with little substance behind it, a warrior code that you might find draped on the tunnel leading onto a football field, or screamed into a boxer's face between rounds. It sounds good, and hits all the patriotic buttons, but not much else. Frankly, it sounds like something out of Zack Snyder's 300, so it shouldn't be a surprise to know the script comes from that Spartan flick's writer, Kurt Johnstad. Nuance and subtlety haven't entered into his playbook over the last five years, apparently.<br /><br />Succeeding in it's primary objective most completely during the film's biggest action set piece, where the actual live fire from the military grade armaments is put to jaw dropping use as the team mounts a watery rescue mission. Waugh and McCoy set the action up beautifully, revelling in the thousands of spent bullet shells booming from the hydrofoil's cannon. This leads to a crazy, high speed chase that shows the directors will make some great action movies in the future. Great Hollywood style action movies. The rest of the film spits in the face of their supposed realism yet again, as splattery head shots are all too frequent, seen in a video game style first-person shooter perspective that we've seen numerous times before. There's nothing new here, and while that isn't necessarily a bad thing, when you make the claim that we're about to experience something totally outside the realm of Hollywood filmmaking, you ought to back that up. Right?<br /><br />Act of Valor is going to be a polarizing film, though, as some will bend themselves into a pretzel to defend it and it's heroic stars. On the way out of the attended screening, a colleague in the same breath categorized the film as being the most realistic military move he had ever seen and it was totally like Call of Duty.  What?  The truth lies somewhere in between. The genuine hardware does add a little something extra, but the bad acting, generic direction, and the filmmaker's outright arrogance does the movie no favors. Waugh and McCoy can pump their chests all they like over using real soldiers to re-enact what soldiers do, but who cares if they fail miserably at presenting a cohesive story? This is a movie, after all, right?

B0067EKY7M|3.0|About halfway through just saying the lengthy title and it becomes clear Salmon Fishing in the Yemen isn't going to be your typical romantic comedy. Can it even be called a romantic comedy? There is a central love story, but it's mostly between an eccentric, visionary Sheik(Amr Waked) and his love of fly fishing. So much so that he hatches a screwball plan to bring it to the desert highlands of Yemen. His reasons are grandiose and noble, even if the reality of it borders on impossibility. Doesn't really sound like something to take your girlfriend to on date night, does it? Are we sure this isn't some Werner Herzog documentary or something?<br /><br />Balancing a healthy dose of quirky romance with a touch of political gamesmanship, director Lasse Hallstrom(Chocolat)  trims down the disparate elements of Paul Torday's novel into a film that only manages to succeed on the strength of its amazing leads. Ewan McGregor buttons up his natural charm as Dr. Alfred Jones, a dull, married fisheries expert with an inflated sense of his unimportant government job becomes embroiled in the Sheik's ridiculous plot by a publicity seeking press secretary(Kristin Scott Thomas) for the British Prime Minister. Unhappy at home with a loveless marriage, and now forced into a job he doesn't care for, Alfred has little reason placate the sheik's chosen representative, the optimistic Harriet(Emily Blunt), who has a mouthful of a last name that becomes a running joke unto itself.  Suffering as her new boyfriend was recently called to fight in Iraq, she is thrown into her work as a means of coping.<br /><br />Lacking any sort of narrative momentum, the film isn't helped by an uneven script by the usually reliable Simon Beaufoy(Slumdog Millionaire). The very niche hobby of fly fishing isn't all that exciting on its own, in fact the very point of it seems to be the opposite of that. So you can imagine how engrossing it is to listen to McGregor discussing the different varieties of fishing lures, or if salmon taken from captivity will travel in the right direction. A missed opportunity was had with Thomas's character, as she steals the show when on screen with her boorish, invasive attitude. The film often veers into darker territory than such a light and airy comedy was built to handle, especially as the Sheik's own followers violently reject his plans to transform their homeland. The Sheik's reliance on faith to carry him through the difficult project is met with philosophical resistance by Alfred, a man of pure science. Their debates are brief, but provide some of the film's best moments of insight.<br /><br />It's the awkward, budding relationship between Alfred and Harriet that keeps the film afloat, as McGregor and Blunt have a chemistry together that is obvious even if their characters aren't that interesting individually. Starting out a bit chilly with Alfred's stuffy demeanor, they slowly build a bond through the improbability of their task, and the desire to see the Sheik's dream of achieving international harmony. As their familiarity with one another grows, and Alfred stops acting like a stuffed shirt, the two become a joy to watch. Amr Waked, one of the biggest stars in all of Egypt who recently appeared in Steven Soderbergh's Contagion, makes for an impressive and charismatic presence.<br /><br />The disparate plot elements never quite coalesce into a satisfying whole, even as McGregor and Blunt prove to be irresistible.

B007C3TVNA|3.0|What is it that we always hear? Not just from friends, but especially in movies and TV shows about parenting. It's that there's \\"no guidebook\\" to being a parent. You just have to do your best and learn as you go. That assumes a level of parental instinct exists on even the most basic level, but what if there isn't? What if you hate your child? What if your child hates you and everything else just as much?<br /><br />In We Need to Talk About Kevin, that emotional deficit leads to nightmarish consequences, the kind that would leave any rational parent breaking out in a drenching cold sweat. When we first meet Eva(Tilda Swinton), she seems adrift in this world. For unknown reasons she's hated and ridiculed by the people she meets on the street. In the heavily used flashbacks we see her during a happier time, spirited and in lust's grip with Franklin(John C. Reilly), the new man in her life. A particularly blissful evening leads to an unexpected pregnancy, marriage, and a fresh start in the suburbs.<br /><br />From there it's immediately downhill, as their son, Kevin, is a handful from the start. Eva can't stop him from crying, to the point where she takes walks near construction sites just to drown him out. He doesn't listen to her, going out of his way to do the opposite of what she wants. She has no connection with the boy, and as he gets older nothing seems to change. The bond isn't there. She's not built for it, and even if she was, Kevin wouldn't want it. In time he only grows more violent and hateful, especially towards her. The dynamic changes as a little sister enters the family, with Kevin having someone completely defenseless to terrorize. Franklin, a clueless schmo of a husband thinks it's no big deal and that it'll pass. He has no idea how wrong he is, about as wrong as a parent can be about anything.<br /><br />Marking the long awaited return of Lynne Ramsay as director and based on the novel by Lionel Shriver, the film poses an interesting nature vs. nurture question wrapped in a real life horror story . Was it Eva's lack of maternal guidance that leads Kevin down his murderous path? Or was he just a bad seed destined to go off on a killing spree? No answers are forthcoming, and that never really seems to be the point.<br /><br />Ramsay, who has been away from the camera for nearly a decade, goes a little too far trying to leave a signature fingerprint on the film's look, bathing it in off-putting colors, specifically heavy reds to foreshadow the upcoming violence. The use of flashbacks and time jumping are overdone and add little to the story's impact.  Ramsay's artistic flourishes, including some of the more dreamlike elements as we flash through Eva's memories, feel tacked on and unnecessary.<br /><br />As many of Tilda Swinton's films tend to be, their success rests solely on her considerable acting talents. Here she is mesmerizing as Eva, a conflicted woman tortured by her own failings, appalled by her hatred for her own son. These are the types of roles Swinton excels at, the ones no other actress would dare to undertake. No one else could play this role and be as believable and haunting as Swinton is. Ezra Miller is woefully miscast as Kevin, however. A likable actor who has done good things before(he's great in City Island), he seems to be fighting to stay on Swinton's level, but ends up snarling and smirking like a bad comic book villain.<br /><br />We Need to Talk About Kevin is a tough film to endure, not because it's bad but because Swinton's performance is so uncomfortably raw.

It was such an emotional roller coaster and a perfect continuance of the first book. I recommend this book to anyone that has read the first.
B004QL7K70|4.0|The teenage party movie. We've seen it all done before and know exactly where it's headed long before the turns ever take place, right? Reckless teenager is warned by his parents not to have too many friends over, keep the house clean, answer the phone...whatever. Said teen agrees but it's always a lie, and the party ultimately gets way out of hand. That sound about right? These movies tend to have the same message about responsibility and maturing into an adult, making the tough decisions. Nothing wrong with that. John Hughes built a career making films that almost exclusively dealt with those themes.<br /><br />Project X has no such inclination, and it's all the better for it. In fact, it's almost like the anti-John Hughes film, making the occasional nod to his work while simultaneously blowing it up by glorifying sex, violence, debauchery, wanton destruction, and all in the pursuit of a little extra clout in the high school hallways. Marking the second time this year that the found footage style has been put to masterful use, marking perhaps a game changing year for the genre, the film follows Thomas Kub(Thomas Mann), a Pasadena high school senior who might as well be invisible to the popular kids. He's not overly dorky or nerdy, just amazingly average and testosterone-free. Even his father thinks he lacks spine. When his 17th birthday rolls around, and his parents roll out of town to celebrate their conveniently timed anniversary, Thomas is explicitly told not to have too many friends over. Yeah....that's not going to happen.<br /><br />With the frenzied assistance of his Guido belt buddy, Costa(Oliver Cooper), who just wants to get laid like he supposedly used to back home, a party is quickly put together. But Costa is a little too good at his job, and in his efforts to ensure a party that will change their social lives forever, he unwittingly invites thousands to show up at Thomas' doorstep, creating a clusterbomb of epic proportions. We're talking a party that makes Weird Science and Can't Hardly Wait look like Sunday school.<br /><br />Along with their overweight buddy, JB(Jonathan Daniel Brown), Thomas and Costa make every conceivable wrong decision during the course of the night, but it only serves to make the party bigger and more out of control. As the crowd swells into the thousands, the family dog is terrorized beyond belief, midgets turn up out of nowhere to be thrown into ovens, and bursting garden gnomes release literal treats of ecstasy. Authority figures get the proverbial and literal middle finger all night long, including the angry neighbor across the street, who isn't taking kindly to the sound of naked girls diving into the pool or the booming bass cranked out by twin DJs on the wheels of steel. Oh, and the neighborhood starts to bear a striking resemblance to a war zone. Mere words can't describe just how insane this party gets. The word \\"party\\" needs to be redefined. Even the cop are helpless against the out of control rager, stymied by a combination of Costa's legal expertise and by a barrage of incoming fire. Perhaps \\"war zone\\" is even too mild to describe it.  Whatever the word, there has never been an experience quite like this on the silver screen in quite some time.<br /><br />That's really what Project X is and has always had aspirations to be: a never before seen movie going experience. Piecing this monstrosity together would have been impossible if not for the perfect combination of people behind the camera, starting with producer Todd Phillips. The thread of anarchistic wish fulfillment is one he seems to have a particular fondness for, seen in both Old School and The Hangover. Debuting director Nima Nourizadeh, a music video veteran, puts that experience to perfect use in some of the film's most stirring stretches of just watching the crowd in their state of euphoria, without a care in the world. The script, which bears a little too much of a resemblance to Superbad at times, was written byMatt Drake and Michael Bacall. Bacall is having a phenomenal couple of years exploring the crazy ways in which young people think, having also written Scott Pilgrim vs. The World and the upcoming 21 Jump Street remake. An oft forgotten subplot involving Thomas and his hot best friend, Kirby(Kirby Bliss Blanton), is the one aspect that is so cliche as to be distracting.<br /><br />The goal of any party movie is to put the viewer right into the thick of the mob, to experience the mayhem first hand. Few films ever actually accomplish it, because the most epic parties are a collection of perfectly aligned intangibles. A movie has to find a way to capture those things and do it in an organic way. The music, the people, the energy, just the right amount of rebellion and fear of what could happen next. Project X, for all the unbelievable antics, makes for an incredibly authentic and unforgettable experience. Too bad the high school parties in my day weren't this awesome.Matt Drake and Michael Bacall.

B0059XTV4Y|2.0|The story of Wallis Simpson and King Edward VIII is a fascinating one. Even as they passed through The King's Speech in a supporting storyline(played then by Guy Pearce and Eve Best), the idea of a monarch giving up his throne to be with his multi-divorced, American socialite lover is the stuff storybook romances are made of. Madonna, who co-wrote the script and makes her first feature directorial effort since 2008's Filth and Wisdom(which nobody saw and for good reason), clearly sees something of herself in Wallis, a woman who to the very lenient was an innocent bystander as the American paparazzi skewered her on a regular basis. More critical eyes will note Wallis' guile and opportunistic nature in all things, but most obviously in how she used her charms to woo her way into the upper echelons of society, even if it meant thrusting England into a constitutional crisis at a time when it could least afford it. The various interpretations of Simpson and Edward's scandalous affair is part of what makes them so intriguing, but Madonna has no interest in exploring any of that, content only with the thinnest representation as possible.<br /><br />Yet, Madonna's decision to present such an idealized view of Wallis(Andrea Riseborough) and Edward(James D'arcy), the future King of England, would have been tolerable if not for the questionable way in which she chooses to tell it. Divided into two separate but connecting stories, one set in 1998 and following poor Wally Winthrop(Abbie Cornish), the beleaguered wife of an arrogant but highly successful doctor. Essentially a trophy wife, Wally endures his emotional and physical abuse, even as she struggles to get pregnant through a series of fertility injections. Finding an emotional void in her life, Wally becomes obsessed with the story of Wallis and Edward, which she sees as the perfect fairy tale romance. Unable to resist hovering around a collection of their personal belongings up for auction, she looks for answers to her own problems by looking at their pasts, and in the process maybe finds new love with a surprisingly astute security guard(Oscar Isaac).<br /><br />Slipping back and forth through time to draw some rather slim parallels between the two women, it becomes increasingly less clear why Madonna split the narrative this way when clearly her interests lie in the past. The best way to explain it is that she had an overabundance of artistic energy and no idea how to harness it, as some of her flourishes make no sense. Sometimes it's hard to tell if she's shooting a biopic or a bad commercial for blue jeans or perfume. The confusion is amplified by an oddly selected soundtrack, especially when a drug fueled party thrown by Wallis and Edward roars to life accompanied by the Sex Pistols.<br /><br />Even if some of the creative choices are bizarre, at least the historical segments have some flair to them. The present day scenes are a crashing bore and shot in as flat a tone as possible. Abbie Cornish, usually such a firecracker on screen, is helpless against the bland cinematography and silly, melodramatic script. There has scarcely been a love more dull than that of Wally and her all too perfect Russian guard who comes off a little stalkerish as he watches her anxiously through the security cameras.<br /><br />Wallis was treated pretty shabbily in The King's Speech, but Andrea Riseborough tries to give her a touch more depth despite not having much to work with on the writing front. We see Wallis' intensity and devotion to the man she loves, even as she knows she'll be forever hated for taking the King away from his people. D'arcy is forgettable as Edward, especially when compared to Guy Pearce's previous charismatic turn. It's really unfortunate that this film had to come out in the wake of the 2010 Best Picture winner, because it's impossible not to compare, and when done so W.E. is found to be severely lacking.wn problems by looking at their pasts, and in the process maybe finds new love with a surprisingly astute security guard(Oscar Isaac).<br /><br />Slipping back and forth through time to draw some rather slim parallels between the two women, it becomes increasingly less clear why Madonna split the narrative this way when clearly her interests lie in the past.

B005LAIH2W|2.0|When the majority of the buzz surrounding your film is the question of how much it cost, then there's a problem that usually ends with some studio exec's head rolling on the floor.  With Walt Disney and director Andrew Stanton noticeably shaken over the numbers being thrown out about the cost of John Carter($250M! $300M!), that type of scrutiny has been their reality for the last month. What was the response? A full force marketing blitz that wreaked of desperation, which ended with a 10 minute sizzle reel of clips that turned out to be the perfect cure for insomnia.<br /><br />Unfortunately, that footage was an indicator of what was to come, as all of the dollars spent on re-shoots couldn't make John Carter any less of a boring, incomprehensible drag. Edgar Rice Burroughs, the famous adventure author and creator of Tarzan, would himself be up a tree if he saw what has become of his nearly century old Barsoom novels. Based on the first in the series, A Princess of Mars, the film is led by charisma-free Taylor Kitsch, showing none of the snap glimpsed when he played Gambit in the otherwise terrible Wolverine film. His John Carter is an emotionless cypher, a former captain for the Confederate army who can't seem to stay out of trouble. We're introduced to him via his notes, left behind for a young Burroughs(Daryl Sabara) to read. The author began nearly all of his Barsoom novels this way in a clever little twist, as if Carter's space faring adventures were real and he were simply discovering them. After an interminably long setup, Carter is mysteriously whisked away to the planet Mars, where presumably the action begins.<br /><br />Instead what we actually get is a string of poorly realized characters with convoluted back stories, droning on about some sort of civil war. Known as Barsoom to the natives, the world looks like the bone dry Tatooine segments in The Phantom Menace, only with less pod racing. Or if you like, imagine Waterworld without any water, and that's a pretty good idea of how lame this place is. It's also an indication of the level of convoluted political maneuvering you're likely to face. For some inexplicable reason, Sab Than(Dominic West) of the Zodangans hates the people of Helium, including their badly dressed king(a depressed looking Ciaran Hinds). Yet he wants to marry their feisty and very busty princess, Dejah Thoris(Lynn Collins), in a scheme devised by a bunch of bald headed mystical shapeshifters. Throw in some alien Tharks, a few white apes, and some random mumbo jumbo, and what you have is an action movie so convoluted it makes Inception look like Yogi Bear.<br /><br />It's not as if the plot is all that deep, it's just impossible to tell who anybody is or what their angle is. Nor will you care. Carter arrives and everyone thinks he's some sort of messiah because he can jump really far.  Imagine what the Hulk could do in that gravity. Pointless questions like this will infect your brain because nothing happening on screen will hold your interest.  At such an exorbitant cost, you'd think that money would have bought something more lively than a bunch of unimpressive lizards and mountain landscapes. Stanton, a Pixar vet who directed no less than the amazing Wall-E, appears tripped up by the source material. He certainly didn't have the same live-action success as his colleague Brad Bird did with Mission Impossible-Ghost Protocol. John Carter too closely resembles many films we've seen already, sadly ironic considering Burroughs novels were the impetus for so many of them.a pretty good idea of how lame this place is.

B004SBQGHS|4.0|Some reviews state that you will not lose your process from the free version, but that is not true for all devices apparently. I purchased this ad-free version for my Kindle Fire and it did not install over the free version and keep my progress. Instead it installed the purchased ad-free version alongside the free version, as if it was a different app. Would have liked to have kept my progress, but not going to get upset about it since I had not played it that much on my Kindle Fire as opposed to my iPod, in which I had completed the whole thing before the latest update of 15 extra levels. Which brings me to another point...I wished the Android version got updates as often as the iOS version.
B005LAIH4A|4.0|Adapting the timeless works of Dr. Seuss into feature films has proven to be a lucrative, if not always creatively successful venture. The problem has always been in finding a style that can adequately capture the author's unique style. Live-action movies like How the Grinch Stole Christmas were hamstrung by leaving the animated format, and The Cat in the Hat suffered a similar fate made worse by Mike Meyers' inability to be funny. A CGI version of Horton Hears a Who! better interpreted Seuss' daffy visual style, and that model is employed yet again with equal vibrancy in The Lorax, a film that shows the author's cautionary tale is as vital today as ever.<br /><br />Dr. Seuss(real name Theodor Geisel), who never went into one of his many classic children's books with a moral in mind, nevertheless expressed many of his views on the world through his stories, with The Lorax perhaps being the most overt. Essentially a cautionary tale about the dangers of over industrialization on the natural environment, the rather simple story has been given some extra padding by the folks at Illumination, bringing some of the same zany humor from their hit, Despicable Me(including a couple of nods to the film). Taking corporate greed and ecological neglect to an apocalyptic nth degree, the story takes place in Thneedville, a city completely made up of plastic and not an ounce of nature in sight. A chirpy little song in the beginning tells us that the people of Thneedville like it this way, with their plastic trees and bottled air(a clear shot at those who pay for packaged water). 12-year old Ted(Zac Efron) exists in this bright but bland composite town, zipping past his blissfully unaware neighbors on his motor scooter. He's infatuated with his neighbor, Audrey(Taylor Swift), and when she expresses the desire to see an actual living tree, Ted makes it his life's mission to make sure it happens. Heck, he might even get a kiss out of the deal. With the help of his mischievous grandma(Betty White), Ted learns of a mysterious recluse outside of town known as the Once-Ler(Ed Helms), who may know where the last trees can be found.<br /><br />Braving the smog filled world outside of Thneedville, and drawing the suspicion of the town's benefactor(Rob Riggle), Ted discovers the Once-Ler is a man burdened by years of guilt. The architect of Thneedville's creation and destroyer of the once plentiful Trifula trees, the Once-Ler was once just a man with a dream to strike it rich. Discovering that his silken invention could only thrive by chopping down all the trees, he runs afoul of the Lorax(Danny Devito), a little orange blob of a creature who serves as the spiritual protector of the forests. If Ted wants the last Trifula seed, he'll have to listen to the Once-Ler's story of how he let corporate greed blind him to the destruction being done to the world around him.<br /><br />The Lorax has come under scrutiny lately from some who feel it's \\"indoctrinating\\" children to despise big business by painting them all as evil. Those dirty industrialists! The story is actually a redemptive one for all involved, not just the Once-Ler but for Ted also. Ted's mission starts off as completely selfish, he could care less about the environment or making the world a better place. He just wants to impress the hot girl in town. Through the Once-Ler's story, he learns to appreciate nature in all it's forms and the benefits it provides that plastic and steel simply can't replicate.  Those complaining about The Lorax's lessons either don't know the book has been around for some forty years, or have never seen the film. Probably both. Those same people, who always seem to make more noise equivalent to how wrong they are, fail to realize that The Lorax isn't all that different from most children's stories. Then again, these are also the same folks who think suggesting healthier meals for kids is akin to turning the country into a police state. It's all just nonsensical politicalpandering. The Lorax, who is friends with the Once-Ler early on, doesn't have a problem with industry. He gets angry when it destroys everything else just for some short term profit. Surely, somebody like Lou Dobbs can see the difference, right? Eh, probably not. He's not paid to understand nuance.<br /><br />Directed by Chris Renaud, The Lorax is bold and dynamic visually, although the 3D adds little real value. Calling this simply a film for kids seems inadequate, because the message truly is universal and one that all people need to hear. It's about taking personal responsibility for the welfare of this planet. How something like that can be considered a hot button issue nowadays is absurd, but The Lorax gets its point across in the most fun way possible, just like Dr. Seuss would have wanted.pandering.

B005MTHRAA|5.0|Long out of print, finally released and a beautiful film.  This is a European film, so American audiences take note. If you think Will Farrell is funny or Mark Wahlberg is an actor or Steven Spielberg makes interesting films, then this is probably not for you. It's slow, very slow, very very slow. There's almost no music to wake you up as you fall asleep in your popcorn.  There's very little violence to pump your adrenaline up and, unforgiveably, there's almost no blood.  There's no nudity and no sex. Again, it's a European film.<br />If you appreciate Bergman, Fellini, Antonioni, or Almodovar, you might like this one.<br />Aside from the fact that it's the only fiction film Callas ever made, it's a gem. Accompanying it is a beautiful documentary on Callas.
B003Y5H5B0|4.0|Be real. When you first heard that Jonah Hill was planning to remake 1980s era, Stephen Cannell produced cop series, 21 Jump Street, you probably scoffed and wrote it off immediately. You wouldn't be alone, and the reaction isn't without justification. Helping to launch the career of Johnny Depp and being the highlight for others like Holly Robinson and Richard Grieco, the show was ridiculous on its face, centered on a special crime unit of youthful looking adults infiltrating colleges and high schools.  Frankly, the show was more cool than good, and neither by the final season. Fortunately, Jonah Hill and writer Michael Bacall knew there was no reason to revere the source material, deciding to go for something akin to Superbad meets Police Academy. It was a gamble, but a gamble that paid off as 21 Jump Street isn't just hilarious, it's a modern day comedy classic.<br /><br />Achieving the heights of hilarity that 21 Jump Street does couldn't have been accomplished by simply bringing the same old tired idea and plopping it onto the big screen. Too many other attempted remakes have made that mistake, thinking adding a few modern wrinkles will suffice. High school is nothing like it was twenty years ago. The social dynamics are different, the students are different, and the idea of who should be popular has experienced quite a shift. Setting up the change beautifully, we are first introduced to Morton Schmidt(Hill) and Greg Jenko(Channing Tatum) in high school, where Morton is an nerd doing his best Eminem impression, while Greg is the prototypical popular jock stud.<br /><br />Fast forward a few years and both are enrolling in the police training program, and both are terrible for reasons the other can compensate for.  Greg becomes the brawn, and Morton the  brains. After proving they don't have what it takes to handle the rough 'n tumble beat as bike cops, they are unceremoniously dumped into a rehashed program to use young looking cops as undercover agents in high schools. Wearing a sense of self awareness on its sleeve, the film takes a few jabs at itself for being a warmed over rehash as well, up to and including the use of Ice Cube as the token angry, African-American police captain. Cube, who has become an expert at playing off his old N.W.A. persona, is in rare form here, snarling and sneering at every opportunity. If there's a scene stealer, it's him.<br /><br />When it comes to comedy, it's the little details that matter the most are often the funniest. Greg is hyped for an opportunity to go back to high school and be the popular guy again, while Morton is justifiably terrified of reliving those traumatic years. What they discover upon arrival is that the entire culture is different. Greg's bullying antics make him a loner, while Morton's brains and gentle nature earn him cred with the cool kids, which he uses to try and infiltrate their drug ring.  In a lot of ways, 21 Jump Street has smarter insights into the ways teens think than some documentaries dedicated to the subject. You know from the start that Greg is going to get drunk off his new found popularity, and while it plays out like something out of Can't Buy Me Love, it works.<br /><br />Insightful thought it may be, there's plenty of room for gross out gags, penis jokes, and toilet humor. Hill is old hat at this type of thing by now, although it's unfair to say he's playing the same role here. His character is a little less self confident than usual, and not at all the miscreant he played in Superbad. Tatum, a better actor than many want to give him credit for, shows an affinity for physical comedy we haven't seen from him before. It's hilarious to watch his blank, clearly confused face as the world he thought he knew is flipped upside down. Even more so, he's a ball to watch leaping over cars and beating up rowdy teenagers. The jokes at his expense, since he clearly has the body of a thirty year old man and towers over everybody, are some the film's best. Tatum seems more than willing to roll with the punches and cut loose. For the most part, the supporting cast shines as well. Bridesmaids co-star Ellie Kemper is equal parts sweet and filthy as a teacher with a Mary Kay Leternou style obsession with Tatum. Dave Franco doesn't have much to do, but Brie Larson gives a winning performance as Molly, the girl who falls for Hill's charms.<br /><br />With so much attention focused on Hill, Tatum, and Bacall, it's easy to forget that the glue holding this madcap adventure together are directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller. Their only gig up to this point was the animated Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, and you can see they brought some of the comic madness of that film into 21 Jump Street. The action sequences, of which there are plenty, are fast paced and splashed with a little bit of Looney Tunes wackiness.<br /><br />You don't have to have been a fan of the show to appreciate this 21 Jump Street, but if you were then the film will feel even more special. Cameos are sprinkled throughout, including one especially brilliant appearance special for 'Jump Street' die-hards. There's practically nothing this film gets wrong. Even the closing credits rock. If there's one thing that they can do to screw this up it's making us wait too long for a sequel.m seems more than willing to roll with the punches and cut loose.

B004A8ZWVK|5.0|This was a great price for this movie and along with free 2 day shipping, well you can't beat that!! Was really excited to see this movie and get it for a very affordable price.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|Many reviews provide a detailed review of this watch, so I'll keep this pretty general.  I've had mine a week now, and it's averaging +12 seconds/day, which is respectable for this price point.  I expect it to slow down a bit more over the next 3 months as it gets worn in, hopefully settling on something within 10 seconds/day.  Took the watch camping and have wore it all week, it has no scratches anywhere, still looks new.  Lum is great, as I can easily still see the time at 4:30 in the morning without any special effort to &#34;charge&#34; the watch face.  It should be noted that the lum is not very apparent if there's sufficent ambient light, but once in the dark it's very easy to read.  Others have stated that the watch face is small, I disagree.  The watch looks to be standard size to me (~37mm), but if you think a dive watch is normal size, then this probably is not going to be right for you.  My biggest concerns with this watch are the 30 meters water resistence(this rating does not mean you can swim down to 30 meters, it's recommended that you don't swim with the watch at all), and the fact that I have to wear it everyday or it runs out of juice (but that's automatics for you, nothing unusual about this).  Overall I'm happy with this watch considering it's price point.  If I paid a little more, I might still be happy.  Recommended if you like how it looks, are ok with a normal sized watch, understand that automatics aren't super accurate (but you still want one anyway because they're just cool), don't plan to swim or shower with it on, and you plan to wear it daily.  If you just like how it looks, but want something more accurate with better water resistence and with less worry about it running out of power, look into the Citizen Eco-drive line of watches.  There's one very similar looking to this one, at a moderately higher price.  I considered the Citizen, but liked the idea of an automatic.<br /><br />Edited to add:  I've had this watch for a few months now, and I'm still happy with my purchase.  No scratches on the watch at all yet.  I reset it each month, setting it ~2 minutes slow, but the end of the month it's usually ~2 minutes fast.  It's seems to run run about 8 seconds fast per day, which is great for an auto this inexpensive.  Overall, I'm still very happy with this watch.  I've really come to appreciate the fact that the lum lasts throughout the evening.  And even though I've taken it off for 12+ hours at a time, I've not yet had it stop on me as some reviewers have indicated has happened to them.<br /><br />Edited to add (11/28/12): I've had this watch for ~8 months now and I've been wearing it nearly everyday. I have a single light scratch on the face, but nothing horrible, the rest of the watch still looks perfect. I did take the watch off for a 24 hour period, and it did end up stopping on me, but other than that one time it hasn't been an issue.  I'm still amazed by how bright the dial glows at 3 AM in the morning (and having just had a kid, I am up at that time frequently). I've also noticed that I've only had to reset the watch a couple times over the last couple months to keep it within two minutes of the actual time. When comparing the watch to the offical US time, it appears I'm gaining about 5 seconds per day (based on a 3-day average), which is about as good as anyone can ask for from an auto. Overall I'm still very happy.<br /><br />ETA (10/28/13): Still love this watch. The face seems to be very good at resisting scratches. So far I have not had any additional scratches on the face of the watch, although I do have a few scratches on the case now. Nothing I can't live with, I could even clean those out by buffing the entire case with a dremel, but that would ultimately remove the bead blasted finish (still would look great though, might do that in another year or so). I haven't been tracking the time keeping ability of the watch recently, but I almost never have to reset the time, it's close enough to perfect that the only times I can remember changing it recently were when I was resetting the date at the beginning of the month. Still very happy with this watch.<br /><br />ETA (7/7/14): The watch continues to perform well. I've worn it daily since receiving it, and it still looks pretty good. No significant wear since my last update, face still looks very good and case has some minor scratches. The time keeping hasn't remained as good as I had hoped, but it's not bad. It runs about 5 minutes fast every two weeks. I just set it 2 minutes slow each time, and I'm never more than a few minutes off over the course of the 2 weeks.<br /><br />ETA (11/6/17): The watch still functions, but has taken a backseat to a newer citizen eco-drive of similar style.

B004T2QZL8|5.0|Love the game! The only complaint I had was it froze with the original download but update was made available the same day and fixed all issues. Great response time/support.
B004T2QZL8|3.0|this game annoys me on my kindle, it makes it impossible to play. Amazon needs to fix the force close bug! maybe then it will recieve 5 stars!
0545091020|4.0|Let the Hunger Games begin!  My husband and I both listened to this... it kept us wanting more.  Eager to listen to the next two books in the series.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|First of all, I wanna say thanks for putting this complete series on sale and delivering it on time. Second, Daria is, IMO, a true 90s classic because I use to watch it on MTV all the time and have the shows on tape. If you like Beavis & Butthead (in which Daria was in before having her own show), I'd recommend Daria to anyone.
B0071T5PN0|5.0|China Town,<br />Stay Frosty<br />She's A Woman<br />As Is<br />Big River<br /><br />are some favs, but the album as a whole is great, and has the vibe of the VH (DL era) us fans dug them for.

0307957934|1.0|After reading 'Enigma', which was both well-written and well-researched, this book was a huge disappointment. The hero, who was supposed to be a genius, behaved so idiotically that it was hard to feel any sympathy for his plight. His wife, who is an 'artist' was equally unappealing. Not only doesn't she stand by him when he is obviously unwell, but she berates him for having made so much money, while she (of course) stays home and 'creates' in her sculpture studio. There is not one thing about either of them that is the least bit likeable or compelling.<br /><br />On top of that, for a book about a sophisticated computer program, it appears that the author did not bother to get any input from anyone who actually works in the IT field, so the book is filled with off-putting mistakes and gaffes. CPUs do not lie around on metal shelves in data centers, like so many cereal boxes in a supermarket. Motherboards do not sit out in the open and somehow just function. They are both parts of a computer and are absolutely useless without being assembled with the rest of the parts, unless you are in great need of a paper weight. While I would not expect most people to be experts on technology, I do expect a writer to do research and the lack of it was a glaring flaw.<br /><br />Sadly, the plot was also dull. I finished the book, but it was a real effort and it let me down page after page.<br /><br />I cannot believe this is the same writer who wrote 'Enigma'. I do not think I will try any of his other books, as I think it may have been 'Enigma' that was the fluke.

044024238X|3.0|Spoilers:<br /><br />Overall, I liked it. The main characters were likable, the story was a fun, fast read. However, there were several problems.<br /><br />First of all, it was predictable. Every choice that was made was well-telegraphed ahead of time.  The \\"mean boss\\" was the better boss in the end. The \\"nice boss\\" was a crook.<br /><br />Second, of course her high-powered mother was mean and neglectful. A woman can't be a raving success at work and a good mom, right?<br /><br />Third, there was no balance. She couldn't end the book being a successful lawyer of a private practice where she could help people but have a reasonable workload. Of course not. It's either \\"Work 90 hours a week and have no life\\" or \\"work 40 hours a week at a low-paying, service job but be blissfully happy.\\"  There's nothing wrong with being a housekeeper, but there also is nothing wrong with excelling in your chosen field!<br /><br />I would have liked to see her remain a lawyer but not necessarily at the crazy firm. But at a firm where she could be close to her boyfriend but still work. Maybe a firm where she would have to commute or he would? Much more realistic.
B001AQTWF2|5.0|GREAT CD, AS EXPECTED. \\"I LOOK TO YOU\\" IS ESPECIALLY CHILLING NOW THAT SHE HAS LEFT US. EVEN WITH MINIMAL RADIO PLAY, THE TRUE WHITNEY FAN WILL APPRECIATE THE LYRICS AND BLESSING OF THAT VOICE...

B0052VUNHC|4.0|I first want to say that this is the 4th book from Jamie McGuire that I have read...and really one of the best. I agree with there being typos, and yes, I was put off by the amount of fighting too, but the idea of a man changing to make himself a better person is something that any girl/woman would want.<br /><br />My loves:<br />-A tattooed, tough, bike riding, I want to cuddle, tell you how I feel, and wrap you in my muscle-y arms and never let you go guy...I'm so in. Trav was the kind of guy that would be completely honest with you, but also tell you you're beautiful while he held your hair while you were sick.<br />-My boyfriend happens to be my best friend and someone that I also hung out with in much the same way as Abby does with Travis before she knew how she really felt about him...no we didn't have a bet causing me to sleep in his bed every night, but I do recall some afternoon naps. I think what some people forget is that they both were somewhat attracted to each other from the beginning, they're both single (I don't think a couple dates with whats his name is called \\"exclusive\\").<br />-Pigeon...I love the name, I love what it references, I love the voice that I have used in my head for what I think Travis sounds like.<br />-I love how Jamie used a guy to be the individual with the psychological problems. Trav lost his mother at an early age and didn't know how to really respect women and Abby was the first (and last) girl that he would fall for. I think the mistakes he made were realistic and made him human...do I think he could have used a therapist, yes, but I also realize this is the first time he may have ever dealt with situations like watching his girlfriend get hit on by other guys, watching his girlfriend get man-handled by a potential racist, etc etc.<br />-Travis wanted to become a better person for Abby...when he messed up, he tried to fix it...I think that's something we can all relate too.<br />-That Travis protects Abby. I know some of you think he goes too far, but as a girl, I would want someone to protect me (especially if I was like Abby who never had someone to protect her before).<br /><br />Some...could have been betters:<br />-I think the fighting is a little intense...however Jamie doesn't write about his fighting enough to make it the whole plot. I do like the fact that the guy has a bad boy rep and fighting helps...and that his fighting only goes as far as his paid fights and protecting his lady.<br />-I wish they would have talked about getting both Travis and Abby some relationship support, but I get that its a book and fiction, and I don't think a weekly therapy session would have been a good part of the storyline. Similarly, I wish that we could have heard a little bit more about Travis's past...I think this would help some of you Travis haters...<br />-I didn't want the book to end the way it did...it was a little too wrapped up in a shiny, diamond bow...but I guess Jamie wanted to show that love can make it through some pretty rough situations as long as you want it to...<br /><br />I loved Travis in Beautiful Disaster. I think anyone who didn't needs to hold judgments until they read the second book in this series, which will be in his point of view...maybe everyone will get to see what is going on in Travis \\"The Mad Dog\\" Maddox's head. =)think he goes too far, but as a girl, I would want someone to protect me (especially if I was like Abby who never had someone to protect her before).<br /><br />Some...could have been betters:<br />-I think the fighting is a little intense...however Jamie doesn't write about his fighting enough to make it the whole plot.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Although I've owned a Kindle for over a year I have not previously been so enamored of a book to write a review. I had gotten notice of the first book \\"Wool\\" as a freebie and was curious.  I browsed the reviews and was quickly convinced I should spend the $4.99 for the whole Omnibus and I'm so very glad I did.  This story is one of the best Science-fiction books I've read in a very, very long time.  I REALLY want to know more about what happens next and I intend to look into other works from the same author.<br /><br />[ASIN:B0071XO8RA Wool Omnibus Edition (Wool 1 - 5)]]

B004LWZW8I|1.0|Was really looking forward to seeing this movie.  Love Lord of the Rings, new Clash of the Titans.  This movie was nothing but fighting, no real story that made any sense.  It was graphic violence that was not needed throughout the entire movie.  I would not have minded some of the violence if the plot or acting was any good.  I find it sad that these roles are the only thing Mickey Rourke seems to get.  My husband and I found it so boring that we shut it off halfway through.  There have only been a few movies that we have shut off and not given a chance.  We were really disappointed.  If you need to see it, rent it, don't buy it.  Hope this helps!!
0312641893|5.0|She has grease stains on her face instead of ashes. She's looking for the mechanical foot that fits her best.  And she drives to the ball in a beat-up gasoline car instead of a magical pumpkin. Welcome to Marissa Meyer's inventive re-imagining of Cinderella, the first of four books in the Lunar Chronicles.<br /><br />I finally got around to reading Cinder, and I'm so glad I took time off from my scheduled review requests to do so.  Cinder was everything I was expecting and more. Yes, I would say it exceeded my expectations.  May I make a suggestion to all aspiring writers out there, including the ones who are self-publishing their books because they believe they can write:  please read Cinder, for it is a perfect example of how a book should be written. Not only is it a bang-up story that will have you turning pages faster than a runaway hover craft, but it is perfectly written, perfectly paced, and packed with so much emotion and so many engaging characters that you will wonder where the time went.  I flew through it in a couple of days, and it only took me that long because I had to stop and (reluctantly) feed my family.<br /><br />When Cinder begins, World War IV is over, but the country of New Beijing is fighting a losing battle with a deadly plague. Cinder, a lower class citizen who is virtually the property of her stepmother Adri, is a cyborg mechanic who runs a repair stall in the town marketplace and also fixes everything mechanical that breaks down at home. Like Cinderella before her, she also has two step sisters. Pearl is mean and spiteful, but Peony is Cinder's only human friend. Until one day Prince Kai himself, heir to the throne of New Beijing, comes to her stall to have his favorite android repaired.  The prince is intrigued by Cinder's secretive nature and her lack of interest in him. But although she is attracted to the prince, Cinder is afraid of Kai discovering her secret: that she is part machine. Indeed, her cyborg parts include a foot and a hand, which she covers up with a grease-stained glove.<br />When Peony contracts the dreaded letumosis plague, Adri forces Cinder to \\"volunteer\\" as a test subject to find a cure for the disease.  At the medical center Cinder meets Dr. Erland, a kindly but determined old man whose task is to save the dying Emperor, Prince Kai's father.  In Dr. Erland's medical facility, Cinder learns a horrifying truth about herself, giving her one more reason to avoid Prince Kai.  As is the case with many of the characters, Dr. Erland has his own secrets, and although he seems suspicious at first, he later becomes Cinder's trusted friend and ally. With the arrival of Queen Levana, the evil ruler of Luna, the future of New Beijing rests on a terrible decision that Kai must make, and more than one life hangs in the balance. Readers may be equally thrilled and frustrated by the ending, which comes all too soon.<br /><br />Besides her creative take on the Cinderella story, Meyer fills her story with details that remind us that we are indeed in science fiction territory. For example, Cinder is programmed with an orange warning light that flashes at the corner of her vision whenever someone is lying to her, and her mechanical leg has a hinged door behind which Cinder stores her tools.  One of my favorite characters in the book is Iko, Cinder's wonderfully quirky android and constant companion.<br /><br />I'm always grateful to writers who can surprise me, and Meyer surprised me throughout the entire book. She doesn't go for the obvious happy ending, and for that she should be applauded.  At the risk of giving too much away, there were many times during the story when she could have saved a beloved character, but didn't.  It is this bravery in part that elevates Cinder above the many other young adult fantasy books on the market today.  When you read the final paragraph, just keep this in mind: luckily for us readers, Cinder's story isn't finished. The second book in the series, Scarlet, arrives in 2013.ives in 2013.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|After all the coverage about this book I decided I had to pick it up. I had also already heard about the origins of this book as a fanfic.<br /><br />Now with that in mind when I started reading it I wasn't shocked. It's pretty heavy on the BDSM in the beginning but it slows down over time. It's a decent read. I enjoyed it for the most part. There were moments where I felt like the story  was lacking so they just threw in sex to make ti better. This book is like lots of sex scenes with bits of story then more sex.<br /><br />The story is a usual romance girl meets boy they fall in love. Boy is bad for girl and they fight their love. She finds out how 'bad' he is and runs off. Eventually they fall in love. It is moderately written a few oddball sentence structures are scattered throughout the novel though. Overall it's not terrible, but it's not this amazing novel even though I managed to read it pretty quickly.<br /><br />If your looking for a twilight sex novel this series is for you.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|I played for a short time and now does nothing but force closes when I make a pairing. I cannot do anything else in the game now.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I found myself unable to put this book down and much better than the first in the series. This also took me a day and a half to read because I enjoyed it so much.  The second book I feel is even better than the first in this series. This book pretty much picks up at the end of the last one.<br /><br />A lot of the book is spent on developing Mr.Grey's character and his relationship with family along with Ana. We learn more about his 'problems' and why he is the way he is. Along with where he came from.  Many of the issues with Mrs. Robinson were also addressed in this book which made me REALLY happy. The ending left me at a spot where I was able to break from reading the series for a few days before starting book 3.<br /><br />I think the direction of the story has been very satisfying so far. It doesn't really veer off the path of a typical story in this format but it offeres enough 'new' stuff to keep me interested. Plus Mr. Grey is just amazing as a character. If you liked the first book I think you will enjoy this one even more.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|Decent game, if it would work.  After some point in the game progression, the app dies (force quit) at every new combination attempt.  If fixed, would rate 3 - 4 stars.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|You can stop bashimg the game now because of the force close. They just released an update fixing the problem.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|very cool game!!!! its fun yet a little tricky!!!!! these games are so addicting! fun from start to finish for everyone :)
B00127RAJY|2.0|I never write reviews, ever. But, I thought it was important to give my opinion and share my experience. I read the reviews before starting the workout. I saw that it was said to be rough on the knees, even those with no knee problems. I had an injury as a child when I was around 10 year's old, fell a few times on the same knee.  It aches in bad weather and if overused but I have been running for over a month every day for about 30 minutes so I thought I would be fine.<br /><br />I did Jillian's video on Monday.  I did the video and followed the low impact girl, knowing my history with my knees and wanting to ease into it.  My knee hurt on Monday afterwards, very achy.  Yesterday, Tuesday, my knee REALLY hurt. I went out and bought a knee brace. I could barely walk all day. I did walk, I fought through it and dealt with the pain.  Today, Wednesday, it hurts less but not much less. I still can't walk well and I have it propped at the moment on a cushion.  No more running for me until this heals. No more Karate. I was doing Tong Soo Do twice a week and fine.<br /><br />I plan to write down the ab and arm workout and continue to do that every other day and my running on the days in-between once I've healed.<br /><br />In the end, I don't think this is a safe workout and good for your body.  It seems VERY basic when you are doing it, but I believe it is too hard on the knees.  I was running, doing Karate and since I was a kid have done numerous workouts and nothing has taken me down until this.<br /><br />Just thought others should know.

0553801473|1.0|The last two books were just flat out, plain old horrible.  After reading the previous book, (and, actually, I'd started this at the end of the that book), with this book I had gotten unbelievably bored with the series, and would read the first two pages of every chapter, and, if it didn't grip me, i'd skip to the next chapter (I love my kindle and ability to quickly do that).  You would think that this would lead me to ending up at chapters where I didn't know what was going on.  Amazingly enough, that never happened!  Apparently, NOTHING happened in this book.....
B004T2QZL8|1.0|Great game except it forces closes after 30ish elements.  Only way I've been able to stop the force closing is by resetting my elements in the options menu.  Fix the force closing so I can give more stars.

B0051HNMTI|5.0|I liked the free version enough to upgrade, and i use this and the companion arm workout almost daily. the latest update is great as you can now create and save custom routines. also now viewable in landscape mode (although limited view doesn't show timer). using on kindle fire. combining the two routines gives me an effective 10 min workout that's surprisingly easy to stick with.
B004EF6632|5.0|I just loved the miniseries! Although I have not read the book, I trust BBC to have created a historically true and accurate adaptation. The romance story line I enjoyed the most - it reminded me of Jane Austin's eternal novel Pride and Prejudice. The last minutes of the film are unbelievably emotional, I had to watch it several times! The actor's play is very good and I greatly enjoyed the character's presentation by Richard Armitage and Daniela Denby-Ashe.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|the app wad working for me but then it started force closing a lot but i think it's fixed now or atleast for me anyway

B000V5ZIBU|4.0|It's so nice to see the first seasons of what must be the most underrated Star Trek ever.  So contemporary in the way it deals with themes that confront us right now:  The push-and-pull of religiously-based cultures vs. humanistic ones, the stress of constant war, questions about rebuilding a society that has been destroyed by exploitation and occupation, and examining how people from very different backgrounds can find ways to work together.<br /><br />Dark in tone, by Star Trek standards, but in an enlightening way.....
B004T2QZL8|5.0|Just putting it at 5 so that the dev's 'might' continue updating as they indicate in the program. App works fine until you have a certain number of combinations figured out and then it force closes on every incorrect combination. I was able to tin thrum the whole game and extras as long as I didn't make a mistake. It feels like some kind of cache setting wasn't developed properly...<br /><br />Still, it's an entertaining game if u can work past the fc problem.<br /><br />EDIT: I got an update AFTER rating this 5 star. Don't know if it's available regularly or if you must rate it to get the update to keep it from crashing. In the credits section of the main menu the dev's let everyone know about the '5 star hint' fyi.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|This game is so awesome I had no trouble with it! I recommend this game to you if you like to match things.Please its free. I hope you enjoy this as much as I do...GET IT!!!!!!
B004T2QZL8|3.0|This is a fun game, i've played it before on the PC, but this force closes after about 20 combos. I'm giving 3 stats cause in thinking if it doesn't force close than it would be 4-5 stars
B004T2QZL8|5.0|Quite iritating. I only was able to do 50 elements then started to force close every time I get an element cpbination wrong! I hope you guys can fix it

1469984202|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the Wool Omnibus. I could not put my Kindle down. It is not very often that I write reviews or give anything 5 stars however my delight over this entertaining series is such that I must share it with everyone. Do yourself a favor and read these books they are absolute genius. I can only hope that there will be more in my future.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Reading the reviews on this book, hearing people talking about it, I thought that this would be a great book to read.  Book 1 left you hanging, the plot and the characters were great. Book 2 became a little bit boring. It had basically the same plot as the first.  By the 3rd book, I didn't even want to finish it. I had to force myself since I paid money for it.  I lost interest after the first chapter.
B0067EKY7M|3.0|Sugary snacks sneak into many of our diets because immediate gratification trumps the fact that nutritionally there's not much there.  Salmon Fishing is a cinematic sugar snack that will please most viewers with its sunny, sandy optimism and pleasant leading characters with nary a dark side among them.  Yes, some nasty terrorists show up, and a few humans and fish lose their lives, but this movie pushes on with its gentle, sentimental tones to a place we all know it's headed from the get-go (romantic happiness and professional success in the Arabian peninsula).  Premised almost like a 1930s screwball comedy (and acted by Kristin Scott-Thomas as if she'd been cast in one), the movie unfortunately has far less comic energy (this Salmon's a low-carb snack).  The story takes its sweet time to get to the Yemen and other plot-point destinations, and isn't afraid of melodramatic twists and turns.  But it offers enough emotion and good performances to render a mild sugar high.  Like most simple sugars, however, the effect's not long lasting.

0439023513|2.0|First of all, SPOILERS below.<br /><br />I finished the book an hour ago, so the details are still fresh in my mind. Right off the bat, I can say that the feel of the book was completely different. The first book was fast-paced and exciting; I finished it in one night. The second book was a little less fast-paced and exciting, but again, I couldn't put it down. This book was just depressing and slow. There was hardly any action until the last quarter of the book, and when I finished, I just felt so crushed and depressed.<br /><br />The characters that we have grown to love were mutilated and ultimately changed beyond recognition. Katniss, the spitfire teen who doesn't care what anyone thinks of her; Peeta, the gentle & sweet young man with a 'golden tongue'; and Haymitch, the drunk that we all came to love. All of these characters end up unlikable and unrecognizable. (Gale didn't really have much of a personality to begin with, but you do learn more about him.)<br /><br />Katniss morphs from the strong ingenious female, the 'Girl on Fire' in the first two books to become a chronic drug abuser. I really wouldn't have suspected this, particularly after all she had to go through. I imagined that after the ordeals from the first two books, she would have been stronger. But you spent a large portion of the book with Katniss in the hospital on drugs, and the other half listening to her thoughts complaining about how her life sucks (it does suck, but I would have liked the fictional heroine to have a better message to give to the audience).<br /><br />Peeta is basically left out of the book, and even when he does show, he literally has his personality changed. Although he has some redemption by the end of the book, his lack of presence contributed to making the book feel completely different than the first two. And Haymitch hardly shows. It's like Collins just got sick of his character and let him drop off the face of the map.<br /><br />Collins adds a whole new slew of characters, but a lot of them are unlikable and just feel alien to the series.<br /><br />This book is essential for closure to the series, and when I was halfway through the book, that was the only thing that kept me reading it. If this was some sort of stand-alone novel, I would certainly have not read. Or if this was somehow the first book of the trilogy, I can guarantee you that Collins would not have met with the success that she did.<br /><br />I almost want Collins to create a fourth book, an 'alternate ending', in which maybe there was an actual 76th Hunger Games, with a whole new set of traps and Tributes. Anyone with me?
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have read science fiction/fantasy for almost 45 years. The series that I have most enjoyed are those by Robert Jordan, Issac Asimov, Frank Herbert, Terry Goodkind, Brandon Sanderson, David Weber, and George R.R. Martin. The Wool Omnibus by Hugh Howey ranks in this top tier.  His story and writing are gripping.  If you like science fiction, you will not be disappointed.  He deserves first rate recognition for his work.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|What a wonderful app!  I have purchased 4 versions of the Bible for my Kindle and now with the YouVersion I have dozens at my finger tips.  The various study guides are a real plus.

0307352145|5.0|Quiet  The Poser of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking by Susan Cain was such an eye opening read for me.<br />I am an introvert...no it's not a bad word!  It simply means I like Quiet and time to process my thoughts.  And yes!  I can talk too.<br />While reading Quiet I learned so much that I had misunderstood.  Not just about myself but about others, too.  For example, on page 226, \\"Is something wrong with me?....Probably the most common - and damaging - misunderstanding about personality type is that introverts are antisocial and extroverts are pre-social.  But as we've seen, neither formulations is correct; introverts and extroverts are differently social.\\"  This statement gave me SUCH freedom.<br />We, as people, are all created differently and uniquely.  One of my uncles is energized by people.  He loves to talk and talk to people he doesn't know.  He loves to be surrounded by people and is energized by their thoughts and talking.  On the other hand, my dad, his brother, loves to work in the garage building wonderful pieces of furniture or toys.  I love them both and they both have a special place in this world even though one is an extrovert and one is an introvert.<br />Reading this book was like drinking a tall refreshing glass cold lemonade.  Just the right amount of \\"sour\\" with the tingling, refreshing feel of \\"sweet.\\"<br />I loved the conclusion of this read...the \\"blueprint.\\"  Ms. Cain tells us to put ourselves in the right lighting.  Some of us need Broadway lights and some need a lamplit desk.  &lt;love this analogy><br />I was impressed with the insights of this read.  A great read for all...no matter if you're an introvert or an extrovert!<br />*This book was provided by Waterbrook/Multnomah for review*

1400069289|4.0|My usual habit is to pick up a mystery novel and engross myself in the imagined problems of nonfiction characters. I decided to change this habit and try this nonfiction book with the rather intriguing title that professed to help identify our habits and show us how to change them. Habits are those things we initially choose to do, which have evolved, through repeated use into things we do without thinking. Written in language even I can understand, the book breaks down the pattern of habits into three parts that we can recognize and change. The author illustrates that by first identifying components of a habit, we can then work to change them. This is a self help book that may actually be of some help, if we want to change. This book was provided for review by Random House. Now, where did I put that mystery novel?
0142419400|4.0|In short, the story is about a teenage girl from atlanta georgia, who is sent to boarding school in paris by her father. Anna, meets an American-English lad by the name of Etienne, a relationship, in which this book wraps around. The story is told threw the eyes of our main character, Anna. You really do get a sense of being a teenager and the ups and down of friendships and falling in love. The only thing I dislike about this book is the way that Anna worships Etienne like his is a GOD. Everytime she sees him, she tells us about his every gesture, every smell, every imagination...ENOUGH! haha, we know how you feel! But the author insist on running on and on and on about how she is sooo in love with him. Gets rather annoying, however, I just skip those parts and read along the story. The supporting characters add to the story perfectly. In the end, I do feel like Anna has grown up a lot. The ending made me smile...and yearn for a followup novel on Anna's journey.

1400067936|2.0|Amazon provides an interesting statistical commentary on this and all other products on its site: a graphic of the relative proportions of different star ratings assigned by customer reviews. If you flip this on its side it looks a lot more like what it is: a statistical representation of customers' views of the book.<br /><br />Nassim Taleb's Fooled by Randomness has an unusual \\"curve\\": a short \\"head\\" of 5 star reviews and a long tail of lesser ratings which  doesn't tail off. A large standard deviation, then, against a mean of four stars, compared to Leonard Mlodinow's [[ASIN:0307275175 The Drunkard's Walk: How Randomness Rules Our Lives]]- also a four star average, but a much more conventional distribution of grades  with a tighter standard deviation (a consistent curve from 50% five star to 2% one star, against Taleb's 46% five star and 11% one star).<br /><br />So I have learned something from this (or Mlodinow's) book.<br /><br />Having being equally entertained and aggravated by Taleb's more recent [[ASIN:1400063515 The Black Swan]], I was leery of picking up this earlier effort. While Taleb is undoubtedly stimulating literary company, he does verges on being a crashing bore, crossing the verge on and ramming your letterbox on many occasions. He seems also to harbours some unremedied professional grievances - the award of Nobel prizes is something in particular which irks him. Taleb's writing is constantly grandiose and egotistical - but he is self-aware enough to not only realise but celebrate that fact.<br /><br />So a real vegemite, love-him-or-hate-him sort of writer. Fooled By Randomness is, if anything, *more* bombastic, and its content less interesting. Its first half comprises mainly anecdotes (possibly apocryphal) about colleagues unnamed, and Taleb's repeated efforts to persuade you just how well read and what a voracious reader he is. (Interestingly in Black Swan he places much store in his *anti-library* - the books he has not read). Taleb's early observations about probability are pat, and under explained and, as other reviewers point out, have been more thoroughly and less idiosyncratically expounded by others (my recommendation is Leonard Mlodinow's book cited above).<br /><br />On probability itself, Taleb's love of anecdote sometimes contradicts his own preaching. At one point he recounts a bit of \\"anecdotal empiricism\\" as to \\"Anchoring\\" of expectation. \\"I asked the local hotel concierge how long it takes to go to the airport. \\"40 minutes?\\" I asked. \\"About 35\\" he answered. Then I asked the lady at the reception if the journey was 20 minutes. \\"No, about 25\\" she said. I timed the trip: 31 minutes.<br /><br />Two paragraphs later, in his next anecdote, Taleb rails against the stupidity of a man who derives conclusions from a single observation.<br /><br />There is a seam of useful information in the second half of this book, but you must wade through quite a lot of self-aggrandisement to find it, and none is unique: as mentioned, there are better presented and less irritating accounts of the same information elsewhere, so Mr Taleb may be disappointed to see yet another equivocal assessment of his book on this site.<br /><br />Except, he tells us, he won't be: he doesn't read or care about \\"amateur\\" reviewers on Amazon anyway, so no harm done.<br /><br />Olly Buxtonobservations about probability are pat, and under explained and, as other reviewers point out, have been more thoroughly and less idiosyncratically expounded by others (my recommendation is Leonard Mlodinow's book cited above).<br /><br />On probability itself, Taleb's love of anecdote sometimes contradicts his own preaching.

B003EYVXV4|4.0|Lionsgate's Easter blockbuster is a lengthy, high-octane dramatisation of [[ASIN:0545425115 The Hunger Games]], a \\"young adult\\" novel by Suzanne Collins. It is the first in a series about which I'd heard nothing before this screening. My eleven-year-old son tells me it is quite the thing at the moment. He's read the whole series and was mightily aggrieved to find out that his square old Dad was going to see it and not someone more fully deserving, like himself.<br /><br />Life's like that, son - which is more or less the starting premise of the screenplay. The Hunger Games skips nimbly from the heroic quest via a cutting social satire - our vacuous TV lives are mocked in the style of Neil Postman's [[ASIN:014303653X Amusing Ourselves to Death]] - to a pretty blunt commentary on contemporary geopolitics (the backdrop is a close simile for the Arab Spring), without ever forgetting the momentum and pulse of a great story. Director Gary Ross easily could have laid on the sanctimony too thickly but his touch was light and the picture was the more effective for it.<br /><br />The premise is simple: post apocalypse, there is a ruling clique in the Capitol. They live contented if empty lives by exploiting the plebian ghettoes surrounding their city. As punishment for a long distant uprising, each year two dozen proletariat children are picked out from these \\"districts\\" to fight to the death for the titillation of the Capitol's chattering classes.<br /><br />Here you'll surmise, correctly, that the story is heavily derivative, but of so many things it blurs. There are shades of [[ASIN:B0039O8AQK 1984]], [[ASIN:B000IZXR7U Mad Max]], [[ASIN:B000UBMSB8 Blade Runner]], [[ASIN:B0060CXW3O King Arthur]], [[ASIN:B0027V6AL8 The Running Man]], [[ASIN:B0036EH3WU Lost]], [[ASIN:0800195175 The Fifth Element]], [[ASIN:B005DNPKSQ The Truman Show]], Avatar, Total Wipeout and I'm A Celebrity, Get Me Out Of Here. There were no straight rip-offs, but it was difficult to say the film was any meaningful way novel.<br /><br />But it was executed with plenty of style, with much frenetic use of steadycam. I was sitting in the second row, cowed before a football-field sized screen. I had real trouble keeping the whole thing in focus. The jumpier scenes faded in and out dizzily and it was hard to take in without getting a headache.<br /><br />Nonetheless Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence, looking not a million miles from a ninja Laura Ingalls), dominates the screen and has more than enough presence to carry the drama. She musters chemistry with pretty much every character on the set except Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson), her notional romantic interest, who is a fellow combatant she must, in theory, kill if she is to survive. Hutcherson is badly miscast as a beta-male gladiator, and was in any case asked to play the most conflicted of all the characters. We suspect Katmiss pined instead for lantern-jawed Gale (Liam Hemsworth) an under-explained hunk, or an effete Cinna (Lenny Kravitz) - anyone, in fact, other than Peeta. Even Donald Sutherland's President Snow.<br /><br />For a long film with a long build-up, the background exposition was rushed. The tragic history of the Everdeen family was really only hinted at. Katniss' mother (Paula Malcolmson) is emotionally unstable in ways that aren't explained, and is scripted only moon-faced stares to convey her inner conflict. Partly, there are too many characters doing not enough each to make for a tight backstory. Some economising on roles would have helped a good deal.<br /><br />Still, the film works surprisingly well. The drama struck me, at first, of being a little pat (a rap on TV Reality Gameshows, suggesting contestants really are gladiatorial victims self-wounding for the titillation of the great unwashed) but as it developed the heroic aspect resonated more clearly with more recent geopolitical unrest. Wikipedia reveals that Collins' inspiration came to her when channel surfing between reality TV and CNN's coverage of the invasion of Iraq. This has been cannily updated in terms of the Arab Spring, and in particular the current situation in Syria.<br /><br />\\"Give them hope,\\" mutters Seneca Crane (Wes Bentley), another otiose character in a film full of them, \\"but not too much hope.\\"<br /><br />At which point one must mention a splendid turn from Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson) providing comic relief and vital plot exposition, at least until he resorted to parachuting lines of his script into the rest of the cast rather than saying them (you think I'm exaggerating, don't you).<br /><br />Through some convenient contrivances the seemingly inevitable downbeat ending was avoided, and resolute stares from all assembled at what was a rather unfulfilling conclusion suggest strongly that more episodes from Collins' series are planned.<br /><br />This is a well executed film which is well shot, well scripted, well edited and well paced - although it was a good twenty minutes longer than it needed to be.<br /><br />Olly Buxton<br />Flickfeaste of the invasion of Iraq.

1423113497|5.0|Percy Jackson comes across as a screw-up, kicked out of schools, dyslexic with a heavy dose of ADHD. What he doesn't know is that there is more to him than meets the eye. On a field trip to the museum, a teacher attacks him by turning into a fury and is dispatched by a pen-turned-sword given to him by another teacher. This is his first glimpse at a world he never knew existed outside of the storybooks.<br /><br />I love this book and I plan on reading the rest of the series. Haven't you always wanted to be someone special? What about the son or daughter of a Greek God - a demigod? Percy learns he's the son of Poseidon and he can't ever look back. I loved the action and adventure of this story and Percy's definitely a likeable character. It's like reading the Greek myths set in current times. Excellent, indeed!<br /><br />Percy Jackson & The Olympians: The Lightning Thief (1), The Sea of Monsters (2), The Titan's Curse (3), The Battle of the Labyrinth (4), The Last Olympian (5)

B0029QRA1U|4.0|I purchased this turntable because I wanted a second one for my bedroom. I already own a [[ASIN:B00005T3XH Sony PS-LX250H Automatic Belt-Drive Turntable]] that is in my living room. I decided to go with another brand for a little bit of variety. This model is very decent for the casual listener. I got it for $25 as an open box on here, which is amazing. Set up was one of the easiest, 15 minutes with no help from the manual. But the fact that my goal is not to use this unit to transfer vinyls to mp3 sped up the process. So I didn't need to download anything from my computer and didn't use the CD that came with the turntable. I just wanted to use this unit to listen to my records when I'm in my bedroom, with no plans of converting them (converting vinyls to mp3 doesn't make sense to me as I'm already subscribed to a music service. I would almost always find a vinyl album digitally). This seems to be a good unit although it does not have an automatic start like the Sony unit. You do have to manually push the arm towards the record for it to play. There is however a \\"stop\\" button to stop playback. I'm sure audiophiles would want something of a higher end with better sounds.<br />Update: April 20013 - I read some reviews here -- not too many but a few -- about the arm returning to the resting position when you try playing a record. I've also had that problem about three months after purchase and, for a while, stopped using this unit all together. But I'm reading on the same reviews on here that the solution to that problem is to rewind the record (like a DJ, with your hand, as if you were scratching) to about two revolutions before playback and it would fix the problem. I did just that and it seems to work fine with music playing. I'm not sure if I have to do that every single time I'm playing a record or if it's once in a while. But I'm happy I'm back using the unit when in my bedroom. Thanks to those who offered this suggestion.ny and get the [[ASIN:B0015HOFZI Sony PS-LX300USB USB Stereo Turntable (Black)]].

B005DOKK7Q|5.0|I love how this cover works perfectly for what I needed: just a case to keep my KFire in while I am not using it. If you are looking for more than that, I suggest you look elsewhere. I will agree with what some people have said before: if you bend it or there is a crease that you made, it wont go away. With me being a bit OCD this is something that I control/prevent as much as possible and I advise the same. I dont know much about the smell some people were talking about but since this product does have a leather strap (can be used to help pick up off the table) I guess that's what you should expect with leather, however mine did not have any noticeable smell.<br /><br />It's great for when you need to set down your KFire to charge, just flip it upside down, plug it in, and set it aside knowing that it's safe (especially with young kids around). I also use it in its case when I use my KFire as a stereo from time to time, I just like knowing it's in a case (top unzipped) and not just on a hard scratchable surface.<br /><br />After shopping around at other retailers, there was nothing I could find that compared to this product, and I love the color (a bit hesitant at first but love it now).

B005SFS4ZU|5.0|Long before movies became the dominant force of nature when it comes to entertainment the theater held audiences captive around the world. The lure of the stage for actors' remains but the popularity comes and goes in waves. Twenty five years ago interest in the stage rose once more when Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA opened. Webber combined horror, musical theater and romance into one massive production and it is the benchmark that many musicals are now compared to.<br /><br />It's hard to believe that it's actually been 25 years since it was first performed. It remains fresh for the thousands who see it performed to this day. I was fortunate enough to see it performed live in both Chicago and Cleveland and it still gives me chills to think of the opening. When I heard about THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA 25TH ANNIVERSARY PERFORMANCE LIVE AT THE ROYAL ALBERT HALL I was anxious to see how it would come out. It is amazing and a true treat for those who may have never seen it performed live.<br /><br />If you've never seen the stage performance (and by all means you should) or the movie version (good but doesn't nearly equal a live performance) then you need to watch this. While the Royal Albert Hall wasn't set up for stage performances the crew involved here to a stupendous job mixing the stage performance, live orchestra and video screens to bring it to life.<br /><br />The story itself (for those who've missed it so far) involves a young woman named Christine Daae (Sierra Boggess), a member of the chorus in the French Opera House, who has caught the eye of the mysterious Phantom (Ramin Karimloo). He's coached her and sets about to replace the Opera's reining diva with his prot&eacute;g&eacute;. Mishaps continue to occur until Christine is finally recognized by the new owners as well as their financial backer, Raoul (Hadley Fraser). It seems that he and Christine grew up together and were once in love.<br /><br />The Phantom continues his training of Christine in his underground labyrinth beneath the Opera house in a dwelling he's formed in the sewer system of the Paris. Here he composes songs meant just for her as well as teaching her how to perform. It's obvious he love her deeply but hides not just his emotions but his face behind a half mask due to scarring that took place some time ago.<br /><br />Raoul and Christine are joined together in love much to the displeasure of the Phantom who seeks to possess Christine body and soul. As he manipulates everything about the Opera house to bring her to stardom, a final confrontation between the two men for the love of Christine is imminent. She will have to make a decision between her long lost love and the man who inspires her music with his own.<br /><br />Instead of the scary and horrific monster we've been witness to for so many years when it came to the Phantom we are now presented with a deformed innocent who was tortured and ridiculed most of his life wanting nothing more than to be loved. This Phantom is the most sympathetic character in the film even though he murders, kidnaps and threatens to get his way. His longing for love, not lust, when it comes to Christine is sad and at moments you find yourself rooting for him instead of Raoul.<br /><br />The story would be enough to make this interesting but the music that goes with it only enhances the whole. Songs like \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\", \\"Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again\\" and \\"Music of the Night\\" are tunes that will remain in your memory long after witnessing this piece.<br /><br />As if it wasn't enough to see a near perfect performance of the musical once the entire cast takes its bow Webber himself takes the stage. He thanks so many for their help through the year and then introduces the original crew and then the cast from that first London performance including Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman. Brightman then performs \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\" with five of the actors that have done so inthe past 25 years. These same men then perform \\"Music of the Night\\". It is an amazing thing to watch and enjoy.<br /><br />If you've never seen this musical then this is the way to do so short of finding it playing live. Not only is it a wonderful 25th anniversary present, it's a brilliant musical as well and the package put together to celebrate is one worth adding to your collection.years.

B0059XTUEK|3.0|Marilyn Monroe was an icon of beauty, of Hollywood leading ladies. To this day images of Monroe can be found on everything from posters to shot glasses. She is an image that film fans carry on even though many of them may never have taken the time to see one of her movies. Such is the price of fame and also a bit of the story seen in MY WEEK WITH MARILYN.<br /><br />The movie is based on the true story of Colin Clark (Eddie Redmayne), a young man who intends to not follow in the family footsteps but to become involved in the world of film making as he sets out on his own. Determined to get a job, he applies but is turned down for a position with Olivier Films, the studio overseen by Laurence Olivier (Kenneth Branagh). Through sheer determination and with a little luck, he gets a job there and is soon the third assistant director on Olivier's new film. In essence, he becomes a gofer.<br /><br />It is 1956 and Olivier is about to begin his first non-Shakespearean movie, a romantic comedy called \\"The Prince and the Showgirl\\". Starring as well as directing he has chosen a Hollywood star on the rise as his co-star, Marilyn Monroe (Michelle Williams). But things start off bad and seem to get worse. Monroe is a method actor, taking time to work herself into the role she is playing while the cast and crew wait. Colin is sent to fetch her to the set and finds himself in awe; completely star stuck, but does get her there.<br /><br />As each day progresses tempers flare and Monroe continues with her temperamental attitude. Those that surround her like her acting coach and manager continue to pamper her and keep up the steady flow of prescription medication. Their goal is to stay with the gravy train and ride it for all it's worth. Colin enters and instead tries to offer her a friend that she doesn't have.<br /><br />After Marilyn's new husband Arthur Miller (Dougray Scott) returns to the U.S. to visit his children, Marilyn drops into another depression and calls Colin to her aid. Even though he was threatened by her manager, his devotion to the legendary actress continues. With the help of Colin as he distracts her and gives her the chance to share who she really is as opposed to the celebrity she has become, Marilyn does eventually finish the film. But at what cost?<br /><br />The film fluctuates between two ideas and combines them to make an interesting feature. On the one hand we see the star seeking star treatment that then turns into a gifted talent. So great is her talent that Olivier even comments that she is a natural to Colin late in the film.<br /><br />The other story is of a young girl who has seen the world, who has done what it takes to get where she is and who has lost something in the process. This is a fractured woman who feels she can't escape the caricature she has portrayed because it was after all fame, attention and love that she sought to begin with. But none of those around her truly care about the woman and seem more interested in the character. Except Colin, the young man who gets to know the real woman.<br /><br />Don't think that the movie revolves around a physical love story. It's more about Colin's infatuation that becomes adoration and Marilyn's need for someone to accept her for nothing more than who she really is. In the end there is no way that this romance of sorts can happen or continue. Such is the price of fame.<br /><br />Williams was nominated for an Oscar for her performance here. I'm not sure that it was that outstanding but she does a fine job. The performance is less about her ability to look like Monroe and more about her acting like her in the scenes of the movie being filmed and to portray her troubled psyche off screen. She does an amazing job.<br /><br />More amazing to me was Branagh as Olivier with the same swagger and vocal patterns that fans of Olivier will notice right away. As always he turns in a great performance. Redmayne displays the innocence of a young man and fanatical side of a person infatuated with a star.<br /><br />On the whole the movie is entertaining and enlightening. Will I watch it time and again? Probably not. But the movie is worth seeing at least once. With any luck it will help prevent a future actress from selling her soul to achieve her dream.f a person infatuated with a star.<br /><br />On the whole the movie is entertaining and enlightening.

B00783NWB6|5.0|First, I should say I loved this movie, Kate, Selene, and all the Underworld movies.  I just pre-ordered the regular Blu-Ray version.<br /><br />But second, I noticed they seem to be charging $10 for their \\"digital copy.\\"  Is that really the only difference between the editions?  Crazy.  First of all, all DVDs and Blu-Rays are \\"digital,\\" so the name is stupid.  What I think they mean is portable version, but charging for it is a ripoff.  Come on, we've paid for the content, not the format, and should not have to pay extra for a portable version.  And who wants a portable version that has to be attached to the Internet to work, anyway.  That's not going to do you much good on an airplane, where most people watch portable versions.  Better to save your money on these \\"digital copies\\" and invest it in a good Blu-Ray ripper, so you can convert the main movie to the portable format of your choice that you can view anywhere.
B006P0FICE|3.0|There have been numerous filmed versions of Alexandre Dumas' swashbuckling tale THE THREE MUSKETEERS over the years, my favorite of which remains that starring Gene Kelly and June Allyson. Some have been good, some have been bad and many have been so-so. But it's been a while since one was made so I guess it was inevitable that we have a new one thus we have this latest version from director Paul W. S. Anderson, the director behind the RESIDENT EVIL series of films as well as 2 ALIEN sequels.<br /><br />Right off the bat we notice a change as the original story has portions tossed aside and new more modern items included. The original 3 Musketeers - Athos (Matthew McFayden), Aramis (Luke Evans) and Porthos (Ray Stevenson) - are aided by Milady de Winter (Milla Javovich) in finding their way into the secret archives of the Vatican in hopes of stealing plans draw by da Vinci for a flying ship. The archives are protected by all sorts of traps that seem more along the lines of things we'd create these days than then. Once they take hold of the plans, they are betrayed by de Winter as she drugs them and hands the plans off to the Duke of Buckingham (Orlando Bloom).<br /><br />Several years pass and things change. A young man named D'Artagnan (Logan Lerman) leaves his family home in the hopes of joining the legendary Musketeers where his father once served. Along the way he has a losing fight with Rochefort (Mads Mikkelson), a high placed official in the government run by Cardinal Richelieu (Christopher Waltz) but is saved by de Winter. When he arrives in Paris the brash youngster soon finds himself involved in not one but three duels with various men he bumps into not realizing that these are the legendary 3 Musketeers.<br /><br />Before they can fight, they are set upon by Richlieu's guard and a sword fight ensues where D'Artagnan proves his mettle with the legends. Upon finishing they are called before the king to be chastised. Except the king rewards them instead while haphazardly telling them to behave. Thus the group of four are united and their loyalty to the crown and not to Richlieu, who hopes to take over control, demonstrated.<br /><br />With the exception of the opening the movie thus far sticks to the original storyline. It continues with a necklace belonging to the Queen in the hands of the Duke of Buckingham but instead of her having gifted it to him here we have de Winter stealing it. That gives us more of an opportunity for Javovich to have a larger role than in the book as well as a chance for her to display the fighting/action techniques she's displayed in other roles, perhaps because he husband is the director. You think?<br /><br />A dance is planned and Richlieu plants in the mind of the King that the Queen could prove her loyalty to him by wearing the necklace since he was the one responsible for de Winter stealing it. With only days to save the Queen the Musketeers are sent forth to retrieve the necklace and save the day. Along the way they come across various plans to stop them as well as numerous steam punk modernistic weaponry, including the flying airships. I have to assume that the makers of this film felt that today's youthful crowd would be hard pressed to accept anything less than a video game mentality when it came to weapons and fighting sequences.<br /><br />All of these minor quibbles aside the film is an enjoyable piece of entertainment. The action sequences are well filmed and the effects are dazzling. The acting is far above what one would expect for something like this and the characters well though out and performed. Perhaps the only thing that seems odd is the number of various accents displayed when all characters involved are supposed to be French.<br /><br />Anyone renting this will have a fun time at the movies so much so that it might even be worth adding to your collection should you be a swashbuckler or Musketeers fan. It will definitely offer you an evening of entertainment. My onlymajor gripe comes at the end when a set up for a sequel is clearly put forth in the most unsubtle manner. Other than that, it's all fun.major gripe comes at the end when a set up for a sequel is clearly put forth in the most unsubtle manner. Other than that, it's all fun.
B0059XTTW8|3.0|I found Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy overhyped.  It's a decent kind of film, but hardly something that's going to keep an audience on the edge of their seats.  For one thing, there are far too many characters and nuances to cram into a two hour film.  Much better for a mini series perhaps where characterizations can play out and actually mean something.  In spite of a strong cast, no one gets quite enough screen time except for Gary Oldman.  Don't expect excitement.  Expect to concentrate and then maybe feel a bit hmm.. about it.  Of course, John Le Carre fans may love this, but so much is under the surface that it's a somewhat humdrum experience.  Like that date that talks a lot but doesn't do much.  Smouldering ashes...
B004UXUX7S|5.0|There are movies that are released and then discussed later when Oscar time rolls around as being the next best thing since sliced bread. The actors and directors are talked about and make the talk show route. Almost always these incidents are nothing more than hype, trying to drum up interest in a film that is nominated but nowhere near as good as they claim. Then there are the rare times when it all clicks and turns out to be true as with THE DESCENDANTS.<br /><br />George Clooney stars as Matt King, a hard working property lawyer whose made his mark while living in Hawaii. As the film opens Matt has had a major setback arrive in a speed boating accident involving his wife Elizabeth. As she lays in a coma while the doctors wait to see how she responds to treatment, Matt is faced with day to day life at home involving his youngest daughter Scottie (Amara Miller).<br /><br />This is not Matt's area of expertise. It soon becomes apparent that home life has little to do with Matt of late and that he has no idea how to be involved in his child's life. Scottie has been acting up at school, presumably dealing with the life threatening situation her mother is in. With no idea how to cope with Scottie, Matt flies the two of them to another island where his older daughter Alexandra (Shallene Woodley) is enrolled in boarding school with the hopes she will help him.<br /><br />But Alexandra doesn't offer all the help Matt needs. Following in her rambunctious mother's footsteps, Alexandra has shown a drug problem in the past and when Matt arrives he finds her drunk. Flying home the next day they talk about what is going on and why she fought with her mother the last time the two spoke. It is then that Alexandra drops the bomb in Matt's lap that spurs on the rest of the film. She lets him know that her mother was having an affair and that she had planned to divorce Matt. This scene displays the acting ability of Clooney perhaps more than any other in his career as he displays shock, outrage, pain and disbelief within a matter of seconds. In addition Matt is told there is nothing more to be done and that due to her living will his wife is soon to be taken off life support.<br /><br />So begins Matt's quest, aided by his daughters and Alexandra's friend Sid (Nick Krause) to find the man his wife was involved with. It turns out the man is a realtor and in witnessing one of his signs in a yard, Matt and Alexandra are able to find him on another island. Soon the four are flying once more to find this man.<br /><br />With little solid clues they trace him to a hotel only to find he's not there. It is by chance that Matt passes him on the beach one morning while jogging and follows him home to a cottage where he sees him with a wife and two children. Having told himself over and over again that he wants to offer this man the chance to say goodbye to Elizabeth, reality isn't quite what he expected. What does he do now?<br /><br />While all of this is going on a side story has Matt trying to decide what to do with a huge acreage of land that his family owns. As trustee for the land, it is up to Matt what they finally do. One group of cousins wants to sell to a high finance man from Chicago who intends to develop the land with hotels and golf courses. The other is a local man who wants to do the same but continue to involve local people. And then there is the minority who feel that the land should remain as it is in pristine condition. In seven years the trust falls apart. If they sell now each cousin and Matt have the chance at making millions.<br /><br />At the heart of the film are two quests involving Matt. One involves his discovering the family that he left behind for the office, getting back in touch with his children and rediscovering who they really are as well as who he is. The second is relating to the land he was put in care of, a land and history that goes well beyond years and property rights and involved a tradition and sense of community. Where Matt will go with either quest isn't seen until the final reel.<br /><br />Clooney is amazing here. Rather than go for an over the top performance he displays so many subtle signs of emotion that you can feel each and every thing that goes through the character's mind as the story unfolds. His frustration, his rage, his sadness are all on display through the performance Clooney offers and it stands out as one of his best. Equally amazing is his supporting cast, most notably Woodley and Miller who show a large emotional depth for their young years.<br /><br />This film isn't a feel good movie but at the same time it isn't a downer either. It offers true moment of humor as well as drama and tells a story that involves you from beginning to end. As I watched I wondered if this was a movie I would watch again or just place on the shelf. In the end I decided it has to be seen more than once with time spent between viewings the better to appreciate what is seen on screen. This is one movie you don't want to miss.unity.

1452101248|5.0|I cannot say enough good things about this cookbook. I've become an opportunistic vegetarian over the past few years and these recipes have given me an excellent way to try new things with vegetables I love and work through CSA boxes. Mr. Ottolenghi's recipes are massively flavorful and span a wide range of complexities in preparation. Other reviewers have commented that he requests diverse spices, which is true for many of the dishes, but none of the recipes I've tried have suffered from omitting ingredients I've been unable to find in my grocery store's international aisle. Everything I have made thus far has been show-stopping, including the Eggplant, Mango and Soba Noodles we made last-minute to bring to a friend's party (low time commitment) and the Stuffed Onions (high time-commitment, but makes the book worth buying on it's own). In addition to producing deliciously complex and visually appealing dishes, the book itself is beautifully laid out and bound. It's become part of my kitchen decor even when I'm not cooking from it. The next time I'm in London, you can be certain I'll seek out Ottolenghi to try his other dishes first hand.

B000RIWAVW|5.0|The 1978 film \\"Halloween\\" is John Carpenter's best work (yes, we've seen \\"They Live\\" and even \\"Elvis\\"). It also has memorable performances by both Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasence. We see for the first time Michael Myers; a legal entity that after fifteen years has escaped the Haddonfield County Test Factory on Halloween eve. Let it be known: this is a classic horror film, unlike the countless sequels and majority of releases that comprise the aforementioned genre.<br /><br />One of the most interesting parts of the film is the beginning. We are lead to believe that Michael was locked up for being a crazed child assasin....which is technically true. But, Michael was no dayroom vegetable in the Cuckoo's Nest. Not at all, he was being tested and experimented upon by very sinister corporations (Sears, McDonald's, DeDonde Inc). They wanted to make sure that Haddonfield was monopolized, so they devised a plan that would take 15 years! Michael was to escape the facility and begin work for a new technology meant to replace AA batteries. But, none of this is explained in the film. Very interesting.<br /><br />We hereby recommend viewing \\"Halloween\\" on DVD with sound unmuted. Michael Myers may or may not be at large, but we certainly know that he went New Wave in 1982. How could he have avoided it?<br /><br />2.342

Tried to cancel my order from Northern Tool within 5 min., was told \\"too late, order was in the warehouse\\". The item did not even ship for 3 more days. Was told that I would have to refuse shipment. Well as luck would have it, the USPS just left the package at the door without even knocking. We got stuck paying return shipping, irroniclly it arrives 3 days after the Amazon one arrived. Return shipping on a cancelled item that had not even left Northern Tool.

Depression is a side effect of dying. (Cancer is also a side effect of dying. Almost everything is, really.)\\"<br />-- a small slice of the affected wisdom of Hazel Grace, from The Fault In Our Stars by John Green.<br /><br />Seemingly everybody, regardless of personal interest, occupation, social situation or general background, carries a list of books with such personal and cultural importance, resonance and transcendent ability to shape thoughts and ideas that may be dubbed as \\"essential\\". For many, such literary classics as Twain's The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, Orwell's 1984 and Salinger's Catcher In the Rye are permanently engraved on this list. Perhaps, for others, Sendak's Where The Wild Things Are or Adams' The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy have mattered so much in the lives of their readers that they, too, are deemed essential. Regardless of exactly which books reside on these lists, what is truly important to highlight is how each and every one of these \\"essential\\" texts have been a transmutable participant in the journeys of the lives of countless individuals.<br /><br />Which brings me to The Fault In Our Stars; John Green's sharply written, smartly balanced and, of course, essential tale centered around the \\"epic love story\\" of two teenager's suffering from the unfair, unpredictable and unrelenting human condition of dying from cancer.<br /><br />For fans of Mr. Green's previous novels (Looking For Alaska, An Abundance Of Katherines and Paper Towns), the author's identifiable use of witty and pointed dialogue is utilized to great effect as he illustrates the stubborn strength in two individuals who refuse to be defined by their disease. Yet, while Hazel and Augustus are perceptively conscience of the strangeness of the lives, they sweetly cultivate and develop an intense and sagacious connection that is, altogether, distressingly endearing, deeply touching and genuinely heroic.<br /><br />Stylistically, what Mr. Green surely excels at is never allowing the pulse of the narrative to get repetitive or predictable. Rather, the author is wonderful at unsettling the reader throughout at just the right moments. Just as he has in previous novels, Mr. Green utilizes a character revelation, from the perspective of the protagonist, to shift the paradigm and introduce a new sense of crisis and focus within the tightly directed narrative while still maintaining an honest sense of truth in the voice of the speaker.<br /><br />Ultimately, Mr. Green possesses the enviable ability to articulate such a satiable level of understanding that unequivocally makes the journey of his stories an acutely unique experience.

B0067QPVD2|3.0|Just watched the Blu-ray, downloading the digital version as I type this quick review. It's just decent, this movie pretty much attempts to explain everything that lead up to the encounter with the Norwegians near the beginning of The Thing by Carpenter. I don't care for the overall casting, no characters are memorable aside from the female lead and the dude that played in Dumb And Dumberer? whatever it's actually called... and he's only memorable because i was annoyed that they cast him until he was killed off then yeah. The CG creatures didn't bother me at all, they were great... the problem I had was basic, the directing... he didn't convey any true sense of hysteria that any normal person or group of people would be exhibiting in this alien encounter situation. The most he gets out of this group of actors is just a type of wide-eyed disbelief and stereotypical fear, let's face it if I was in that situation there would be many moments of outright panic, hysteria that would require yelling and calming others and one's self down, this movie doesn't convey or display any such scenes at all.<br /><br />It's a good film, but lacks the most import ingredient, good directing drawing upon good actors to manifest a true sense of fear, dread and overall hysteria upon facing the gruesome horrific reality of the situation they are trapped within.

Even worse, The Ghost of Tom Joad. Things improved a bit with The Rising, until the horrible Devils and Dust. But, wait - Magic was a masterpiece! I was back on board! Until, shortly after, came the largely ridiculous Working On A Dream. But it had at least a few great songs (\\"What Love Can Do,\\" \\"Life Itself,\\" \\"Last Carnival\\") so there was hope. The Promise had, shall we say, promise, given that the songs dated to the '70s. But it turned out to be a bunch of silly love songs.<br /><br />Regardless, my hopes were high for Wrecking Ball, especially given its inclusion of proper studio treatment of three of Bruce's best live-only songs: \\"Wrecking Ball,\\" \\"Land of Hope and Dreams\\" and \\"American Land.\\"<br /><br />Unfortunately, there are 10 other new songs on the record, and they're almost all god-awful. The music is corny, sometimes synth-laden, drum beats, repetitive, unimaginative choruses and melodies...think \\"Surprise, Surprise.\\" And then, the lyrics...just terrible, simplistc, \\"Occupy Wall Street\\"-level, one-sided, unimaginative...what a disappoitment.<br /><br />Look, anyone with a brain has been able to discern Bruce's politics since Nebraska (and even a bit in the two albums before that), and more obviously on Joad, Devils and Magic. And he's become more outspoken the past decade, which is of course his right. I've remained a fan, despite my political leanings (my favorite song on Magic is the title track, an obvious indictment of the Bush adminstration).<br /><br />But now he's gone too far...silly cliches, a complete lack of comprehension of why we're where we are today: Fannie and Freddie, Barney Frank, loose monetary policy, and of course Obama's absurd presidency. But instead, it's all evil bankers and one percenters, and the downtrodden are just hard-workin' good folk who can't get a break (neverlazy or shiftless, or people who took mortgages they couldn't afford by lying, or simply borrowed to the hilt). I could handle good lyrics with crummy music or crummy lyrics with good music, but no luck.<br /><br />Oh, and saving the worst for last: \\"Rocky Ground.\\" In 1992, I thought he couldn't get worse than \\"Real Man.\\" In '95, I thought he couldn't do worse than \\"Sinaloa Cowboys.\\" But in 2002 came \\"Waiting On A Sunny Day\\" and \\"Mary's Place.\\" Amazingly, he topped himself in awfulness in '05 with \\"Reno.\\" In 2009 I thought the bottom of the barrel had finally been scraped with \\"Queen of the Supermarket.\\" Until now. The silly melodies and simplistic lyrics of this song are bad enough, but then, in the middle, the sure sign of a pathetic old white guy trying to stay cool, there's......RAPPING! Yes, rapping on a Springsteen record. Hell truly has frozen over.<br /><br />Folks, don't believe the five-star Rolling Stone review or the fawning ones you see here and in the media. The emporer is BUCK NAKED, but nobody wants to say so. Even if you buy into the class warfare and simple worldviews, how can you excuse the music? And the rap?<br /><br />I'm putting my ticket for his upcoming concert on Stub Hub as we speak...

B0073LWEXK|5.0|I loved this game. I've played through twice and just started a third time. The graphics are so lush and detailed, the puzzles are fun, the story is more engaging than most. Honestly, I feel transported to another world when I open this app. Needed a couple of the hints, and the map is definitely helpful.
B004LWZW7Y|4.0|This movie tells the story of the much loved Puss.  We learn that as a child growing up in an orphanage, he becomes best friends with Humpty Dumpty.  Together, the two youths fall into trouble, but it seems that Humpty will never be able to shake that life.  Fast forward a number of years, and Humpty runs into Puss again.  This time he's got the ultimate scheme, to steal the Golden Goose from the Giant (of Jack and the Beanstalk).  Humpty convinces Puss to sign on to the idea, and the two go after the Golden Goose.<br /><br />This is your typical Dreamworks film.  The cinematography is stunning, the landscapes never better.  The humor is very strong, although there are a couple lines that (in my opinion) are a little too crude for children 6 and under.  The puns are great, and the movie is laced with them.  The only thing that I felt it was missing was how Puss got linked up with Shrek.  All-in-all, though, this was a very good film.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Well, we all know George.  This is the 1st release of the films to blu ray & it will NOT be the last.  We know he will release them numerous times on blu ray.<br /><br />I am a Star Wars fan & collector for over 31 years-started collecting August of 1980.  Took Empire to do that.<br /><br />Ok, we get all six films wide screen.  BORING DISCS, NO ARTWORK ON THEM.<br /><br />Three discs are extras.  Two of these discs are extras for the six films.  We veteran Star Wars fans know there are still missing deleted scenes-need bloopers.  Commentary for the films.<br />The third disc of extras has different documentaries & specials.  THE ONE I AM DISAPPOINTED IN IS THE SPOOFS SECTION.  Ok, Saturday Night Live-hey people isn't the best the episode where Carrie hosted?  It is NOT here.  I never watched the Friends TV show but is there NOT an episode where Aniston has the metal bikini?  Where is the Big Bang Theory?  Family Guy-so many to choose form & they only did a few bits from different episode.  Where was the one with Mark?<br /><br />And, of course where is the Star Wars Holiday Special?<br /><br />Brochure inside set is LACKING  I expected information on the films-nope nothing.  And that 2 page art work at the back of the package.  The main characters from episodes 4, 5 & 6  OR THE CHARACTERS WE LOVE Han, Leia, Luke in my opinion are barely shown in top right corner.  SHOULD BE RIGHT IN FRONT WITH VADER, YODA, CHEWBACCA & THE DROIDS RIGHT?<br /><br />We can just sit here & await the next time George does a blu ray release & see if improvements are made.<br /><br />Rating 5 for films, package would get a 4
B005HSL626|4.0|this game is great a few times it will freeze but its no big deal and there are a few ads other then that i think this game is awesome i play it everyday
B000PMLFRA|5.0|Well, we all know George.  This is the 1st release of the films to blu ray & it will NOT be the last.  We know he will release them numerous times on blu ray.<br /><br />This set is the original three films on three discs.  All wide screen.<br /><br />The only extras are commentary.<br /><br />So, this is you bones bare set-if you just want the original three films then this is for you.  The nine disc complete set is better BUT not perfect.<br /><br />Rating for films NOT for package-package would get a 3.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|better than the first and has more obsticles. I recommend this over the first though. I hope they make a lot more levels.
B004MC8CA2|3.0|they really need to fix it some verses aren't what the Bible exactly says on 2nx Timothy 2:3 the app said &quot;join with me in suffering...&quot;<br />when the Bible says &quot;endure hardship with us...&quot; PLEASE FIX!!!!!!!
0525425578|5.0|This was a gift. My grandson loved the book. I have no other experience since I have not read this book. I think my grandson would recomend it to other young readers.
B004T2QZL8|2.0|Worked fine for a bit and as everyone else has said, after a while it force Closes everytime you go to combine elements. An app this unstable shouldn't be the FAOTD.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|This game is so fun!!!!!! I you like to think and you like puzzle games this is defiantly for you.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I've played this game through on Kongregate, it's the same fun game. My friend had the iPhone version which was slightly different. This looks like the iPhone version. I have a Bionic and there were no issues prior to this review. There was already an update when I signed in to give this review. Hopefully this will start getting the 5 star reviews it deserves.
B004T2QZL8|3.0|the game is good fun but the force close is insane! I'm glad it was free. once the bug is fixed if ever it will be a 4 star game at least.
B004T2QZL8|2.0|This game was an ok game that was kind of addicting for 15 minutes, then it started to force close repeatedly. Tested on Kindle Fire.
0756407125|3.0|Having finished this book earlier today, I'm sorry to say that I am left with a feeling of immense disappointment.  (There may be some spoilers in this review, but I'll try to keep them small.)<br /><br />Things began to go wrong, for me, when Kvothe happily skips over narrating the story of his trial.  He basically interrupts the narration to tell us \\"It's all boring and I'm not going to waste my time telling you about it\\" and that's it.  I was disappointed, because there are supposed to be so many myths about Kvothe that came about because of that trial, and yet we weren't told about them because Kvothe says they were \\"boring\\".<br /><br />I was kinda glad though when Kvothe left the university.  I thought a change of scenery might be interesting and I was really hoping that it might actually lead to some plot development.<br /><br />But again, the book disappointed by choosing to gloss over the shipwreck.  That one really took a lot for me to get over.<br /><br />Things began to get a bit draggy and repetitive then: Kvothe dealing with poverty is nothing new, and I hardly really felt that this was very interesting at all.  Seen there, done that, get on with the story.  Please.<br /><br />The storyline with the Maer was a bit more interesting, but it dragged too much.  And then, when it finally looked like things might start to get interesting, Kvothe gets sent off to hunt bandits.<br /><br />And, as if the book wasn't already going downhill, it pretty much felt like it dropped off the edge of a cliff at that point.  The book felt too long.  I loved the prose, but oh dear!  The story itself just went on and on.  Tempi was an interesting character, but he's not heard from after a certain point and I doubt he ever will be.  I felt like all the time Kvothe spent with him was pointless when Tempi just sort of leaves and is barely mentioned again.<br /><br />Kvothe doesn't change in this story.  At all.  He learns some cool new skills, but he hasn't grown as an actual character.  Neither do his relationships with anyone else.<br /><br />There wasn't even a climax.  The story just sort of fizzles out and that's it.  I can't help fearing that there's just too much left to resolve for Rothfuss to be able to fit it into the next book.  I can't help expecting to be disappointed by the ending.<br /><br />I'll still buy the next book anyways.  I do love the prose, and the dialogue, and taken on their own, some of the events are fun to read.  Although most drag on too much.  It's all very episodic.  I feel that you could have removed half the book and not noticed a lack of it.
0439023513|5.0|SPOILERS<br /><br />When I finished reading this book, I literally cried- and I am not the type who cries from books or movies. I found the ending quintessentially perfect, the fact that she recognized she needed a flower rather than fire (which she has too much of) says a lot on the development and maturity of the character. I keep reading negative reviews, and it is mainly because readers are upset this wasn't a fairy tale ending. The fact she wasn't with Gale (or Edward as he is likened) and the fact she was hollow most of this book. This book was incredibly realistic in terms of the emotional grief the first two books caused. I read a review in which someone complained about Finnick being dazzling in book 2, to a mental patient in 3, who only revived with Annie. In my opinion that was a vividly real depiction of what was happening. Imagine seeing so many die, and then knowing your love is being tortured, to having them back-perfect portrayal of Finnick. This book truly was in essence perfect, as given the realities of the events in these books the characters followed precisely how their emotional states would be in real life.
B005HP2J66|5.0|This movie was exactly what it was advertised as being.  It's very informative and goes well with the book \\"The Land of Painted Caves\\" by Jane Auel.  Would recommend both the video and the book. Would buy again from this seller.
0143119680|5.0|I just loved this book.  Loved all the great characters.  If you love to read supernatural stories, with love in hem, you will love this book.  The author takes to you a world where different creatures can co-exsit when love is involved.  Its not a sappy book.  I can't wait until her new book comes out in July.
B004RKXNDU|1.0|I found the book hard to read, did not like the writing style at all.  Ended up returning the book.  I had been looking forward to reading it before I saw the movie.  I know in the past I didn't really care for Le Carre books but I thought I'd try again.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|Got this as the free app of the day. Had the same issue as most... Force Close. Then I checked a few hours later and there was already an update available. So I tried it, and the issue is fixed! Works perfectly on my Kindle Fire now. Love the game... simple concept, but difficult to advance quickly. I've put a couple of hours into it, and I still don't want to put it down. Highly recommend!
B004T2QZL8|2.0|this game is really cool and very very original. I cant stop playing it.......but it doesn't want to play with me anymore. yes it has rejected my affection by self closing and freezing up all the time. this sucks because this such a great game. please fix my new friend so we can play together again.
B004T2QZL8|4.0|I was disappointed upon discovering the app of the day was crashing but I'm pleasantly surprised the devs got a patch out by the ends of the day. It's a great game and deserves a better rating than it currently has. hopefully people will revise their previous reviews to reflect the current patch.
0545305497|5.0|Lots of action , suspense, and love very intriguing..stayed up late a couple of times until I finished the triology can't wait for Friday to see the movie!!!
0380713802|5.0|Bill Bryson is one, if not THE, funniest author of our time!<br /><br />I am now the proud owner (and protector) of ALL of Bryson's travel memoirs and have read and re-read them more times than I care to mention.<br /><br />There is one BIG PROBLEM though.  They are TOO funny.  The sudden outbursts of belly laughs.  The loud snorts of hilarity.  Sometimes loud enough to frighten little children and old ladies, not to mention spouses and strangers in a park.<br /><br />I was even accused of contributing to the delinquency of a highly educated adult by an annoyed spouse who was so disgusted by his wife's fits of giggles that he said...\\"why are you reading such a vacuous book?\\"  He'll never, ever be able to understand unless he finally breaks down and reads a Bill Bryson Book.<br /><br />Now that Bryson has moved back to the U.K. after leaving New Hampshire and been appointed Chancellor of Durham University in the U.K. he hasn't chronicled a new travel memoir in quite a while.<br /><br />I've emailed him via his Facebook page begging him to \\"hit the road\\" but to no avail.<br /><br />I guess I'll just have to start all over again at the beginning and re-read one of my favorite Bryson books, \\"Neither Here Nor There\\".
B000002KIK|3.0|Never Say Die is one of their best songs ever. The album's a slight improvement over their previous, Technical Ecstasy. There's more guitar and less synthesizer, the band shows some improvement which would show all the way on Heaven and Hell. I don't get all the bad reviews, it isn't as dark but that doesn't make it bad. It's also their last album with Ozzy before he went solo and is replaced with Ronnie James Dio.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I downloaded this game 3/20 and have not had any crashing issue. its fun making new elements and figuring out what you can combine to get.a certain result.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|okay so it was great until there were force closes then I deleted it and now I can't download it again. I hope this is fixed soon because I love this game
B00729GQ0A|5.0|I read this book in one day because I couldn't put it down. I loved how this book had action, comedy, magic, and romance. The chemistry between the two characters made me blush. I love blushing while reading a novel. Even if it's not the type of book that you would normally read if you like a good love story and you like to keep guessing what's going to happen I recommend this book. With this I have definitely learned not to judge a book by its cover because if I did I would have never read this book. I'm glad a friend recommend it to me because now I can't wait for the next in the series.    For full review visit: [...]
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|I have previously read the Diana Gabaldon Outlander series.  When I moved, the books got lost.  I am now enjoying them immensely on my Kindle.  This is a wonderful series, both in a  historical sense, and entertaining.  This is good reading, and I highly recommend it.
B004T2QZL8|4.0|i thought it was a doddle app.  but i was pleasantly surprised of the interesting game and unique user interface style.  very nice.  keep on going.
B004T2QZL8|2.0|This is a fun rip off of Alchemy, but it force closes on every move after 39 elements. The game is not useable now.
0385344228|5.0|A quick read, this book is hard to put down.  Fast paced and written in the view of the father.  You really come to feel as if you're a part of this family and care for them and wish for them the best, even while wanting for justice to be done.  There is no definitive answer to be found here one way or the other but the reader is left with little doubt as to what really happened.  Several things were predictable but in the end I was surprised.  This book will stay with you a long time after reading it and bring many questions to mind.  Just how far would you go for your children or those you love?
B004T2QZL8|1.0|I downloaded this even with all the bad reviews cause I thought it couldn't be that bad. Well they were right. It was working fine then a force close popped up and now I can't play at all. Can open the game and click to play but then it closes. was really liking the game too. Hope you fix it soon!
B004T2QZL8|5.0|very fun to figure out what element creates what. . . . . . . . . . . .
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I read the whole trilogy this past weekend.  I had no life because I could not put the books down.  Totally worth the purchase price.  I am so sad that it's over.  This author is awesome!
B004T2QZL8|5.0|i love this game woo much and played it on an iphone . i immediately. wanted it but it wasn't on the kindle fire. may e next will be temple run...
B006OAB3ME|5.0|This was more than I expected. I did read a review that was not too good, but I thought it was great!
B004T2QZL8|5.0|cant stop playing.  my son loves it. we were fighting for the game. it is a little frustrating to when you get stuck. its a puzzle.  great for kids.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|good. need kid safe mode for kids great I love update it and you wont have the force close problem.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|It's really entertaining, you care for the characters, the creatures, animation are perfect but they feel real and Lynn Collins and Taylor Kitsch have great chemistry together. A must-see for all the family!<br /><br />Critics said we've seen the story before...in Star Wars, in Avatar. Guess what? ERB was first.
B003Y5HWMW|4.0|It goes without saying that the series is really incredible.  The production values are on par with any big-budget movie and the acting is top-notch.  This blu-ray set offers an excellent way to watch the series, but I could not give it 5 stars for a number of reasons that I'll get into in a bit.<br /><br />The extra features are among the best of any TV series I've ever seen.  There are excellent character profiles, commentaries, and more to keep you occupied for hours and help you understand the world George R.R. Martin has created.  The picture and sound quality are absolutely perfect.  You won't find a TV show with a better blu-ray transfer.<br /><br />What I found to be disappointing about the blu-ray set doesn't make me think it was a bad purchase, but it's things that I've found common among HBO releases before and I wish they would hire better people to control their quality.  For example, before each episode there was a \\"previously on Game of Thrones\\" montage while the show aired, which is missing on the blu-ray episodes.  While I understand that it's understood that there won't be a week between episodes, people don't always watch the episodes back to back, and those clips served to point out key moments in previous episodes that will play a part in the episode about to be shown, and helps bring back memories and plot points that might have happened 3 or 4 episodes prior.  It's a shame that they were left out.<br /><br />Also, I am not a fan of the way they spaced out the content on each disc.  There are 5 discs in the set, and 10 episodes in the series, but the content isn't laid out in any meaningful way.  Disc 1 has 2 episodes, discs 2 and 4 have 3 episodes each, and discs 3 and 5 only contain a single episode.  I am assuming they did this because they've spread the features across the 5 discs as well.  I would much rather they had 3 discs with 3 episodes each, and the last two discs contain the last episode and the bonus features.  As it is now, it's just a while hot mess.  The same features are \\"available\\" on all discs, but selecting one that doesn't actually reside on the disc you have in brings up a prompt to insert the correct disc.  There is also no indication about which features are on which disc, so you just have to put a disc in and hope it's on that one, otherwise you will be forced to switch after the fact.  There IS a booklet included in the set, and in the booklet they list the features, but not what disc they are on.  Also on the booklet are a list of episodes with synopses, a grid with the major houses in the series and the characters that belong to each, and a fold out map of the kingdom.  While that is nice, I would much rather they took more real estate on the booklet to lay out what each disc contains and make the house information or map on-disc content.  What would have been much cooler would be a digital map that lets you zoom into the different areas of the map, akin to the excellent title sequence of the show.<br /><br />One more thing of note is that the discs take a VERY long time to load when put into a blu-ray player.  At first I thought it was my player, but I also tried it in my Playstation 3 and found the wait to me equally long.  From the time I loaded the disc, it took nearly 2 minutes for the Warning screen to come up, with the screen staying black the entire time.  I actually at first thought there was something wrong with my blu-ray player and unplugged it to reset it.  I have many other blu-ray discs that don't take nearly as long, and yes, both my blu-ray player and PS3 are completely up-to-date with their firmwares.  I upgraded the player immediately prior to loading the disc.<br /><br />All in all, this set is a must-have for anyone who is a fan of the series, and it is definitely worth a try for any fans of fantasy or drama who aren't familiar with Game of Thrones and don't mind a little nudity or gore that comes with an HBO production of this nature.  This would have beenthe easiest 5 of 5 stars ever if they had fixed some of the quabbles I laid out above.the easiest 5 of 5 stars ever if they had fixed some of the quabbles I laid out above.
B004J1DBJI|5.0|Can honestly say I have never been more satisfied with any app purchase ever. I am in high level calculus and physics class and if I ever have a problem I enter it in here it not only tells me the answer but also shows me the graph and how to solve it. Epic

B00632HWOG|5.0|In my opinion this app works great on the fire!! Very easy to use, has all options as regular email, and alerts you when new email arrives!
B004T2QZL8|3.0|An interesting and fun game.  It worked fine running right after download.  Now it force-closes the momemnt you select the second of two elements.  Restaring phone (Galaxy SII Titanium, Gingerbread) etc. makes no difference.  Fix the Force-Close and I'll give it 5 stars.
0316056863|5.0|I read this before nodding off each night and found myself laughing out loud, sometimes even waking my spouse (sorry, honey!). It took my mind off my busy, hectic, stressful days, which makes me appreciate it greatly and rate it highly. Tina Fey is a gem and a class act in America's entertainment world!

B004K4IZ54|5.0|The 3D in this movie is fantastic, very well done. Well worth the money. Way better than the 3D in Transformers 3.

B006JSXYPA|3.0|I had high hopes for seeing this movie in 3D. The 3D was not very good. No real depth and poor overall 3D effects. You could tell it was an effect they added after the movie and as quickly and cheaply as possible. When comparing to the 3D from Tron 2, Tron walks away the victor.
B0013ND30M|5.0|This is a beautiful movie and for any Sleeping Beauty fan, the two-disc platinum edition is worth every penny! I especially love how the animation has been re-mastered. The colors and art in this movie are even more bright and beautiful.

B0067R0APK|5.0|I love it. I can even check my moms weather. Note the time seen is the time of the last update, not current time.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I'd just like to say that I've really enjoyed this game and have gone past 28 elements without an issue. That said, I also really like that the developer(s) put out another update in less than 24 hours after being FAOTD, responding quickly to complaints about the force close. I like the challenge of the game, the UI, everything. Did a great job keeping users entertained.
1609611543|5.0|I started eliminating wheat and wheat products just a few weeks ago while reading this book. Yes there are a few recipes and suggestions about what food to avoid - fruit is not one of them - there are many good fruits to enjoy, especially berries. I do know this - since I eliminated wheat, I have also eliminated much of the joint pain I had - especially in the morning (I'm 64) - I used to pop 2 Advil first thing out of bed - not any more. This is a great book - pretty technical in places, but there are a lot of anecdotes and humor to break it up. Yes, I have lost 5-6 lbs, but more than that, I feel 10 years younger already. It made a lot of sense to me - read it and judge for yourself. Like the good Doctor says - all you have to lose is your wheat belly!<br /><br />Update 5/28/12: Been on the no wheat for almost 3 months - down 24 lbs as of today - shedding about 2/lb per week. This works and I'm never hungry.<br /><br />Update 8/17/12: Still with the program - no problem at all - in fact, having a few glasses of wine each night and still dropping weight - about 1 lb+ per week - total of about 35 lb so far.<br /><br />Update 6/16/13: Since starting wheat, starch & sugar elimination in March 2012, I have lost about 55lb and now it's almost second nature - I don't even think about refined carbs of any kind. The amount of energy I have now has increased tremendously. I have found that you will never gain weight with this lifestyle - you may level off for a while, but ultimately you will continue to gradually lose weight. Weighed in at 183 the other day - down from 238 - would like to get to about 175 (at 5'11\\").

Written five years before PKD experienced his 2-3-74 vision which he then spent the rest of his life exploring, researching, recording, challenging, buttressing, re-examining, and relating to his body of work.<br /><br />Ubik-you'll have to read the book to get the meaning of the term-unspools in a future (1992)Dickian world where corporations are interplanetary, the government is global, communication is by fixed-line vidphones, and telepaths, inertials, and precogs read telepathic aura. Oh, and time is fungible.<br /><br />When Glen Runciter of the Runciter organization is wakened in the middle of the night due to the sudden disappearance of yet another of his telepaths, he is concerned enough to \\"consult his dead wife\\" in Switzerland. And we enter PKD-land.<br /><br />A ruthless competitor prompts Runciter to assemble a team of inertials for a project on Luna, and then....<br /><br />But I don't want to lay out the plot. Too much is going on in Dick's world. The story is enjoyable and you need to read carefully, flip back and forth sometimes to keep it all straight. Life and death, time and space, forward and backward, energy and entropy are slippery concepts in Dick's hands. Of course no one is what they seem, but neither is the entire tale what it seems. That's what I like and admire about Dick's novels and stories: they take up residence in my pea brain and bug me long after I've finished them.<br /><br />And trying to explain what Ubik is about I feel is only a subjective retelling of the bones of the story, a retelling which can't do justice to the reading/thinking/puzzling experience. A retelling which reduces a story to just a story. Or more likely, I'm just not up to the task. I can't tell you with great confidence what the story is about because I believe the story is so expertly told that it will have a different meaning for a different reader.<br /><br />In Exegesis by PKD, he talks alot about Ubik, (Ubik the book and Ubik the term). He talks alot about Runciter. The novel is one of the several works which figures prominently in his exegetical exercise. In a way, he seems to believe that his body of work, of which Ubik is an important waystation, presaged his 2-3-74 vision. His work became clearer to him after he saw through to the informational underpinning of the universe. That sound crazy to you? Well Dick wasn't crazy and he wrote more than a half million published words (who knows how many unpublished) after 2-3-74 in pursuit of an understanding of that vision.<br /><br />Ubik by itself stands as an entertaining read, a sci-fi tale that challenges our concepts of reality, life, death, and the big one: why are we here? Serious topics explored in a whimsical, playful, smart narrative with oddball characters at the bottom of the socio-economic pyramid.  Misfits like Dick up against the man, trying like hell to make some sense out of this life down here on earth.<br /><br />Ubik is more than a fun sojourn into PKD-land. But if that's all you get out of it, it'll work that way too. Me: I can't get it out of my mind.<br /><br />[...]t about Runciter.

0545425115|1.0|I tried to be open minded. When I first heard the premise to Hunger Gams, I thought, \\"that sounds exactly like an excellent book I once read, Battle Royale.\\" When people would tell me all about how wonderful they thought Hunger Games was by citing their favorite parts, I thought, \\"I dunno, I seem to remember that from Battle Royale.\\" But hey, all these people can't be wrong, can they? I should just read the book on my own and see if they're similar, right?<br /><br />Hunger Games is the exact same book as Battle Royale minus any of the character depth or psychological games. Hunger Games is poorly written and plods along slowly. Hunger Games tries to make big points about how people consent by silence and the power of love and stuff, but it's so heavy handed, it just sucks all the drama out.<br /><br />Battle Royale is a faced paced, thrilling book all about examining the depths of the human psyche in an extreme situation. Through subtext and passing thoughts, Battle Royale has much more to say about war, the draft, totalitarian governments, and class warfare than the Hunger Games does.<br /><br />If you want a thrilling, deep, challenging, original work, read Battle Royale. If you want the same book stripped of the terror and a few points beat into easily digestible mush, read Hunger Games.
B004V2AWKG|5.0|I just love 'The Giver', and Lios Lowry is my most favorite author ever,I don't know what I would read with out her. Thanks for all the wonderful storys ever.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|After reading the series of books by Edgar Rice Burroughs (and would totally recommend them to anyone, especially the first three books), I was really looking forward to seeing this. The fact that at the helm is a director that actually knows how to tell a story put it in good stead. Even though the trailers did come across as a Star Wars/Avatar clone, and people are already lazily writing it off as such, but as the original book 'A Princess Of Mars' was first published 100 years ago, you can see after reading the book that George Lucas, James Cameron were definitely 'inspired' and mined the books for ideas.<br /><br />Well, that day has at last arrived! John Carter is finally on the big screen, and I have to say, I loved it! From when we first see the battle of the Zodangan and Heliumite airships over the skies of Barsoom (Mars), it really reminded me of the old swashbuckling movies and overall, director Andrew Stanton seems to have recaptured that old pulp action adventure spirit. Yes, I wasn't expecting a true book-to-film adaptation, things were missing or changed from the book, but then again, it's always to be expected. Not everything will translate well from the page and your imagination to screen, not forgetting that the original source material in 100 years old too.<br /><br />I thought the leads played their parts pretty well, impressed with Lynn Collins' Dejah Thoris (I think I'm in love!) and James Purefoy's Kantos Kan, even if his role was pretty brief! I also liked the way the movie was bookended with the Edgar Rice Burroughs (Daryl Sabara) scenes.<br /><br />Forget the critics, it's much better than you think. And if you like a good old fun swashbuckling pulp action adventure, like the Sinbad films of old (or even Raiders Of The Lost Ark perhaps), you should give this a watch! Recommended!
0545101425|3.0|After two fantastic books in the series, Suzanne Collins brings her The Hunger Games trilogy to a close in 2010's Mockingjay. Mockingjay is a solid book, but it doesn't live up to the standards set by its predecessors, unfortunately.<br /><br />The rebellion brewing in the first two books, especially with Catching Fire, finally explodes. In the first half of Mockingjay, our heroine Katniss Everdeen is at the center of things. She's a symbol of the resistance, visiting the front lines and taking part in major events while also encouraging the Districts to continue fighting. This part of the book worked for me. Katniss was her usual strong self, and the action had an important role in moving the plot along.<br /><br />Where Mockingjay falters is in the second half of the book. Katniss leads a mission into the Capitol to kill President Snow. This mission takes up a large portion of the book, and characters we've gotten to know and like die so quickly and so randomly that there's no chance to appreciate what's going on, and it doesn't really advance the story. This thread is then even more disappointing when, in the end, it all goes to pieces in the most gratuitous way possible, leaving the goal unachieved and even more beloved characters dead for little to no reason.<br /><br />This is compounded because Katniss then spends most of the climax of the series locked up and comatose while all the remaining plot threads are sort of resolved offscreen. It was very unsatisfying to not really be there as a reader while everything was resolved, and it was even more unsatisfying for Katniss to suddenly turn so passive and sit out the end of what should be her story.<br /><br />While I would have enjoyed a happy ending, that's really not my problem here. I've read and enjoyed plenty of novels that had dark or ambiguous endings. The trick is, though, that those books build up that sort of ending well, instead of just quickly and randomly killing a bunch of important characters before having the main character become an observer at the end. This sort of treatment isn't even what we've seen earlier in the series from Collins. The central premise of the series has been brutal death matches, but Collins was able to make those deaths and defeats mean something in a way she doesn't manage when the book shifts to war.<br /><br />I listened to the audio version of Mockingjay, read as the first two books were by Carolyn McCormick. McCormick's performance is as good as it's been all series.<br /><br />Overall, if you've read the first two books, definitely read Mockingjay. The series as a whole is still fantastic. Mockingjay's first half is as good the earlier books. It's just a shame that the final book ends on such a flat note.ore having the main character become an observer at the end.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|This was just great, and as others have said, would also make a great movie.  Loved how the story continued to grow, and became even more gripping as it approached the end. Not sure what I'll be reading next, but it'll be hard pressed to stack up to this.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game gets more difficult the higher the level. Visualizing moves becomes more important with each level. Sometimes I play a game just to pass time mindlessly, like Solitaire. Quell isn't anywhere near mindless; you have to think strategically to stay in the game. I like the challenge.

B003O86FMW|5.0|As an adult I was very apprehensive about reading this when my 16yr old brother asked me to. Wow am I glad I did. I could not put it down. I read the complete series. Hunger Games and Mockingjay are in a close race for my favorite. Catching Fire was a bit slower than the other two, but still good. Definately a good read.
B004EPZ070|5.0|I love this movie I can't stop watching it and now I wanna read the book again.  And who plays dex is so hot!
B004T2QZL8|5.0|After the patch, this game works great on my LG Optimus S.  It's hard enough that I get frustrated when picking the same elements over and over, but fun enough for me to keep trying :)

B0071MDA2U|4.0|If you will be reading this e-book on an iPad (using the Kindle app), be aware that the \\"enhanced audio/video content\\" in this version won't show up on your iPad. I have the \\"new\\" 3rd-generation iPad, and every time I get to a point in the book where there should be \\"enhanced audio/video content,\\" a message appears in the text that says something like, \\"there is additional audio/video content here that your device cannot load; a transcript of the content appears below.\\"<br /><br />I'm not so sad about paying an extra $1 for content I can't view--I'm mostly just disappointed that there appear to be videos that go along with Oliver's amazing story that I can't take advantage of! But until Amazon provides an update to the Kindle app that solves this problem, I'd suggest that you buy the \\"non-enhanced\\" version of the Kindle e-book and save yourself the dollar.

B004T2QZL8|4.0|I as well decided to try this app and disregard the unhappy reviews I had previously read. I played the game for a while got up to 83 element, enjoyed it a lot, and then it started to freeze. for small amounts at first then to a point where I had to turn off my kindle fire completely to make the frozen screen go away. I'm extremely frusterated because I enjoyed this game a lot only to find it unable to work...would definitely play it a lot more if they fixed what's wrong.

B002BWP49C|4.0|Had difficulty with the DVD in loading the movie. Finally was able to view, however cannot rewind any part of this DVD to re-view the scene. [[ASIN:B002BWP49C The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part I (Two-Disc Special Edition)]].<br />All the previews that were in the beginning are not now accessible for viewing. Just starts with the actual movie. The actual movie was really as I expected it to be in this series, especially the final scene. Am looking forward to part 2.
0399536108|4.0|Chris Guillebeau writes the online manifesto \\"A Brief Guide to World Domination\\" and multiple other articles, he is an avid traveller and charity worker as well as free-thinker. This book details some examples and suggestions of how to achieve the life you want, rather than the life you are living.<br /><br />A lot of his musings are based around age-old tenets like 'be less materialistic' and 'think outside the box' (I'm paraphrasing) and not all of us can live life like Chris, but nonetheless the message within this book should cause some rousing of dissent in even the most stoic of societal sleepwalkers. A couple of times, it's clear that he is pitching to us despite mentioning on several of his checklists about \\"not selling\\" to your \\"army\\" (readers, devotees) but then references his review score on Amazon.com more than once and plugs a couple of charities at the same time. It's not offensive, but feels a little hypocritical. I can see that part of this is serving his agenda, in the way he is trying to educate us to serve ours, but it probably should have been held out of this book!<br /><br />Whilst not all of his suggestions will be applicable to your personal situation, it is easy enough to see where he is coming from and do the fine-tuning yourself. A well written book with multiple inspiring quotes from famous visionaries amongst the block text and not heavy in the slightest. Recommended for those trying to extricate themselves from a rut.
B005G4TJUC|3.0|I'm just not a big fan of the super fast \\"clip a second\\" editing that's really big these days. Though this is a good movie I can't help but feel it would have been better as a animated reboot of the franchise.

B0002KZAKS|5.0|I was skeptical of these microphones because of the low price, so I bought one to try it out.  I have to admit they sound fairly close to a Shure SM58. It is not identical, but I believe some people when they say they prefer this mic with their voice - the frequency response is a bit different and the XM8500 has a bit higher gain.  The microphone is a tad lighter in the handle than a SM58(making it balanced a bit more heavily on the grill side), but still feels very durable.  This mic is near the quality and performance of an SM58, and at $22 I am just amazed.  I am buying a few more, for live sound I can't see the reason to pay more for an SM58.
B000001F2X|5.0|Just received this CD from ImportCD.com through Amazon and got the Mercury PolyGram 1979 edition. This edition has the origional track selection that includes Lets Go To Tahiti. Sound quality is very good, it just takes a little more volume. He reminds me of Knopfler on several tracks. The tracks are short, but excellent. A great buy at around $4.00 plus shipping, new.

B005LAIH3G|5.0|Not often enough do I experience the wonder and excitement of a fantastic journey that leaves me wanting more. John Carter made me laugh, cry and cheer my way through an all to short 2 hour ride through the barren wastelands of an 18th century vision of Mars. Written 100 years ago, it has been the inspiration for nearly all sci-fi novels and film including Star Wars and Avatar. Director Andrew Stanton has created a film close to all ERB fans hearts and has stayed true to the original text. I highly recommend for all audiences, from teens to grandparents, women to men, this is an adventure worth taking with the whole family.

B007K3JFUQ|4.0|Guy Ritchie's first 'Sherlock Holmes' was a decent, if completely forgettable attempt to reboot/remake the classic Sir Arthur Conan Doyle characters for a modern-movie audience. Now 'Sherlock Holmes:Game of Shadows' is out and while I don't think it comes any closer to successfully rebooting the franchise, as a sequel it makes a remarkable number of improvements and ends up being a very entertaining film.<br /><br />The main story of 'Game of Shadows' has Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson investigating a series of bombings and assassinations that put them on the trail, and in the cross-hairs of arch-criminal Professor Moriarty and master sniper Sebastian Moran. The plot in this film has some fun twists and turns as Holmes and Watson team up with a mysterious gypsy and Holmes' older brother Mycroft, but it's the battle of wits between Sherlock and the Professor that keeps this film engaging; Moriarty is a dangerous and diabolical adversary which raises the stakes in this film head-and-shoulders above it's predecessor.<br /><br />The acting in 'Game of Shadows' is much more level-headed than the first 'Sherlock Holmes' and therefore easier to swallow: Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law's Holmes and Watson act less like a bickering couple and more like long-time friends who actually care about each other. Stephen Fry brings dry-wit and welcome comic relief as Mycroft Holmes. Noomi Rapace is great but seems wasted in a smaller part as the gypsy. Rachael McAdams, who I couldn't stand as Irene Adler in the first film makes a surprisingly welcome (if brief) appearance in the film. As good as these actors are however it's Jared Harris as Professor Moriarty who ignites the screen and the scenes between him and Downey Jr. are nail-bitingly tense.<br /><br />As with everything else in 'Game of Shadows', the camera-work is an improvement over the original 'Sherlock Holmes' though is still a bit overblown. The slow-motion, rewinding-hand-to-hand combat scenes are much more fun as things don't always go the way Holmes plans. The more open environments in this film add to the atmosphere and make the action seem less artificial. Ritchie still favors super-close-ups and a bit too much slow-to-fast motion (I couldn't tell what was going on during one particular chase scene through a forest) but overall the movie stays coherent from beginning to end.<br /><br />As I've said: Guy Ritchie's 'Sherlock Holmes: Game of Shadows' is far from a successful reboot of the Holmes/Conan Doyle characters (and still carries a lot of pointless disguises and sight-gags), but as a sequel that gets right what it's predecessor got wrong it stands as a very fun movie experience.s don't always go the way Holmes plans.

B005LAIH2W|5.0|Having known no previous knowledge of the world of John Carter, I walked into the theater with caution, but I was just blown away when I got to the end.  The ending is what sold this movie as an instant classic and I hope this movie will be remembered for ages to come.  This movie has finally taught me to never again listen to critics or to use their score as a guide as to watch a movie or not.  The effects were awesome.  The world felt real, the characters had emotion and you could tell, even from the cgi characters.  Such character!<br />Once you get to the end of this story, you will truly realize the awesomness that surrounds the story.  Don't listen to the critics!  Watch this movie and I can't wait to get it on DVD!
B004T2QZL8|1.0|It was fun for 5 minutes but then it just force closes over and over. If that ccan be fixed I would give it 4 stars.

B0063IH60K|5.0|I love Solitaire and this version doesn't, disappoint!! It is terrific in visual appeal as well as responsiveness!<br />Kudos and it was free, too!
B000ECX0QU|2.0|This remastering in 1.85 (a bit too larger for a 35 mm base film in \\"flat widescreen\\" format - 1.66 is most appropriate) is not to recommend for the ugly colors: flashy red, some colors faded, finaly bad color balance. Why to \\"cook\\" the originals colors?
B0064NTZQ2|1.0|With all the rave reviews on Rottentomatoes, etc., I thought I'd try this movie out, but it was a big disappointment. There's hardly any dialog and not much action either. I'm not saying that a movie has to be action packed, but if you're not going to have action, then you'd better have some damn good dialog or some other redeeming quality.<br /><br />Ryan Gosling's character would scare off most people because he simply doesn't say much of anything. Maybe the character was on dope because it took him so long to respond to questions. I actually like Carey Mulligan in other films, but her character was pretty boring, too. Whenever Ryan and the son hung out together, they watched TV. Carey and Ryan just drove around in a car without talking (normally this wouldn't be a problem, if you really cared about the characters). One time they all went down to the canals to hang out. How boring is that?<br /><br />Even the first getaway scene was pretty boring. It doesn't draw you in or make you feel anything for the character. In fact, there really wasn't any character development at all. I can't believe anyone made a movie out of this. The actual plot has been done about a thousand times in different ways--only much better than this. I love foreign and indie films for not focusing on action all the time, but this one can't compare and left me cold.<br /><br />There's quite a lot of unnecessary gore. The audience can anticipate practically everything that is going to happen in the movie, yet somehow the main character can't (or the writer thought the audience would be dumb enough not to figure out what would happen). The main character is just plain dumb. I actually don't really like Ryan Gosling's acting, and this just cements my feeling about him as an actor.<br /><br />The only \\"refreshing\\" thing about the film was that there were no stupid sex scenes like there usually are in most movies today. The music was OK and fit the low key style of the film. My advice: skip it!
0439023491|5.0|I am very happy with my purchase it came in like 4 days and it was in perfect condition nothing scratched or tore now all I have to do is read it lol
B005GSY23M|3.0|First I have to say that I didn't like the movie, but I enjoyed the music. If you want the first five songs, you can buy them individually from the original artists. Just click on the link to the artist and you can find the song you like there. I'm mostly interested in the first 5 songs anyway, so that should cost about $4.95 instead of $7.99.

B007FH9GT2|3.0|I have read the books and watched the original films with subtitles and dubbed. The dubbing is quite good; you should try it. As for this newer version, I mainly wanted to see a Hollywood version of a great story. In order to make it Hollywood, they cut out SO much. Love Daniel Craig, and Mara Rooney was excellent, but it was a remake of a currently superb 2009 film...cut down and condensed to appeal to the masses. I will say the acting and scenes were great. I have no problem with that, just the cutting out of too many details. It isn't a bad movie at all, but the swedish version is better.
B0055V6EZE|2.0|His interpretations of Let Them Talk and St. James Infirmary are the worst that I have ever heard. Don't waste your money on this album. He plays the piano well and has good back up musicians but does not have a great voice. The best song on the album was by Dr. John.

B006OAB3ME|4.0|I got hooked on the standards years ago listening to my mother's Nat King Cole and Rosemary Clooney records. I have an extensive collection of this sort of music. This is an enjoyable album with wonderful instrumental support. The people I have asked cannot, however, identify the singer on most of the songs. The person this collection brought to mind for me was Harry Nilsson. I have been a fan of his since the sixties. He also claimed to be influenced by these early songs. His delivery is not quite as bouncy as McCartney's but I think truer to the originals.<br /><br />Obviously McCartney is aging and his voice is not as strong as it once was. However, these songs were often sung by \\"movie stars\\" with little vocal talent.  My favorite collection is one done by Fred Astaire and he certainly didn't have a \\"perfect\\" voice. Rod Stewart is also not the most talented singer but a lot of these songs are about attitude, delivery and the wonderful music.<br /><br />So, if you want a CD with top-notch vocal quality this one might not be for you.  If you want a CD where you get to hear Paul McCartney sing the kind of songs you love with beautiful background music and arrangements you will be satisfied. I often judge music by my reaction when I first hear it. If it makes me close my eyes and just let it sink into me I'm satisfied. This collection does that. Well worth the ten bucks!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I can't even begin to tell you how much I loved these books! I had no idea when I bought this first book, what the story was going to be about. At first I was a little put off by the thought of Sexual Bondage, but after reading these books, I really didn't mind anymore. I liked the fact that it was two consenting adults who love each other. Nothing wrong with getting a little kinky with the person you love! I read all 3 books in 3 days, and yes, my house looks like a pigstye and I've barely gotten any sleep :)  I was so sad when I was done with the books and it took me a few days to come out of my funk. The writing wasn't the best, but the story and characters I had in my mind, made up for that. I would highly recommend this book as longs as your aren't easily offend by graphic sexual content. Like I said earlier, I was a little apprehensive to read about Bondage, but this book was freaking hott!!!!!

0385534639|5.0|I kind of feel like I just awoke from an extraordinarily vivid dream. Overall, the plot of The Night Circus was nothing special, yet I couldn't put the book down. I think this in and of itself speaks volumes about Morgenstern. Her writing had this unique ability to transport me directly into the setting. It was descriptive enough to do this, yet remained clear and concise (although not overly so), which I think is truly a feat. Throughout the book, the tone took on a lightness interwoven with an underlying sense of tragedy. I didn't want to get too comfortable with the situation at hand as I constantly felt like the magic was sure to crumble at the drop of a hat. The darkness kept me interested, while the brightness kept me hopeful.<br /><br />In addition to the writing, the characters really spoke to me. I'm not sure what it was about this particular group of circus folk, but by the end of the book I felt like I had developed some pretty strong connections to most of them. Each character had a very specific purpose - no character was unnecessary and they seemed to all fit together perfectly. I feel cheesy describing a book about a circus like this, but The Night Circus was absolutely magical.

B004GUSG4M|5.0|From the very first page, Before I Go To Sleep captured my interest. I knew the basic premise of the story, which sounded interesting enough, but I had no idea I would get so wrapped up in this book! Watson took a really cool approach in using journal style to tell us the main character's story. I have always loved journal style - first because the chapters are short, but coming in a close second is because it always feels a little more authentic to me. I think it's a really great way to take the reader straight into the mind of the main character, which when dealing with someone with such an interesting case (she can't remember anything when she wakes up) makes for a very new spin on the style.<br /><br />Before I Go To Sleep was gritty and dark and disturbing, yet at the same time there always remained a glimmer of hope. I don't want to say too much more because I really do think you should read this. And for all those movie execs reading this (???), hire someone to draft the screenplay...this baby could make millions.
B001NB6QI0|5.0|rattle and hum got many great songs...It's one of my favorites from U2, maybe because before came the magic THE JOSHUA TREE and after comes the magnificient ACHTUNG BABY...RATTLE AND HUM got great live tracks, PRIDE and BULLET THE BLUE SKY are even better live...HAWKMOON, LOVE COMES TO TOWN, SILVER AND GOLD, and GOD PART II are among the best U2 ever done!If you like U2, you will love this one!
0385535139|3.0|Ohh John Grisham, you disappoint me once again! The Litigators lacked the pizazz that his older novels were always overflowing with. It verged on the good side of ok the whole time. I kept reading the book, mostly because I like John Grisham's writing style. He is the master of short chapters, which has always been my reading weakness. I think to myself, \\"Oh, you absolutely have time for one more chapter\\", and then BAM I'm sprinting to my car because I've managed to read an extra 3 chapters and run late for work. But enough about me...<br /><br />I think I took biggest issue with the plot. It just seemed like the bulk of the book was focused on things that didn't end up being all that important. Consequently, the parts I wanted to hear more about were summed up in a millisecond. I kept thinking some giant twist was in the works. There had to be something that was going to redeem this novel because, after all, this is Grisham! The master of twists and turns and awesome novels. Right? right? Bueller...???
B0006399FS|2.0|OK, ALL THAT YOU CAN´T LEAVE BEHIND got many mellow moments, but got some U2 gems...This one trully got 1 track VERTIGO...the rest of this atomic bomb is a lot of EXTREMELLY sentimental songs...Edge guitars are good as always, but BONO lyrics are very mellow and all the stuffs turns to be way too soft...Not one of the best by the great U2...
1400049628|1.0|I can't believe this book has been getting such high ratings!! I had such high hopes for the book, but it got pretty painful towards the middle and I almost stopped reading. I just kept hoping that Brooks would pull out some of that World War Z magic that I know he has stashed away somewhere. The whole book was comprised of list after list and it just ended up being extremely repetitive. There were lists for weapons to use on the defense, weapons to use on the offense, terrains to seek out on the defense, terrains to seek out on the offense, supplies to pack, and on...and on...and on.<br /><br />I thought it might take a slight turn for the better in the section that chronicled previous zombie attacks. A few of the stories were quite interesting, but for the most part they were kept to about a 2 page limit, which made them all blend into each other. The section with the most potential ended up as yet another list to add to the rest. I know the whole book was meant to be a parody, but I just wasn't able to appreciate the humor of it.<br /><br />Here's my advice (which I just know you have been waiting with bated breath for): if you want a really great book that is disguised as a zombie novel, but really represents so much more, go for World War Z. If you A) have already read World War Z and feel like it didn't give you enough detailed information about zombies or B) are genuinely concerned about learning how to survive a zombie attack, then you're probably better off reading The Zombie Survival Guide.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|I found it very interesting a must read to comprehend the factors involved in the making of successful people and products.
0553801473|4.0|I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this book, given the relatively negative reviews. I found the book exciting, well written and entertaining. The slow disintegration of the corrupt Casterly Rock kingdom proceeds, with the threat from Winter, the tensions of forming an alliance with the Wildings and the re-emergence of dragons ... I find it amazing that people regard this book as slow. The course that Arya Stark has taken is a mysterious but as fascinating as ever, as is Bran's tale.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is great, I use it all the time. The NLT daily reading version even has recordings, perfect for listening to when you are doing something else, or when you get distracted easily from reading.<br /><br />The only issue with this app is that you have to be online to use it. So if you are driving or cant access wi -ti, you cant get to your readings.
B00003CXHJ|5.0|I had a relative that was lost on the USS Kete in March 1945 and to this day it<br />is not known what happened to them.  The were on their way back to Midway from the coast of Japan and made a radio report and then was never heard from again.<br />The Navy think they were sunk by a Jap sub on its return to Japan and in turn was<br />sunk before it returned to base and report.  Another possibility is it may have<br />hit a mine that was free.  This movie will give you an idea of the life on a WW II sub and the sheer terror it is at times of battle.

B00051E906|5.0|* After the Fukushima disaster, I learned that the only radiation monitoring numbers I could get (and they meant nothing to me) came from an EPA station over 100 miles away with months-long delayed analysis --and their air sampling wasn't working at the time. I bought an RD-1503 through Amazon.com and have logged an average of 5 cycled readings a day ever since.<br /><br />* I've had no problems with my 1503, but I've read that a lot of handling can loosen up a critical solder connection inside, so treat it nice. Don't let it get contaminated, wet, or even very humid.<br /><br />* The best way to use this instrument is to pretty much keep it at home, protected inside a small, thin, resealable plastic sandwich bag. Do your monitoring in the same way, at the same location, and at about the same time of day --so that you have a meaningful \\"base line\\" of readings for comparison. You want to methodically do 5 \\"background\\" readings and average the results, then subtract that average from 5 readings on anything special.<br /><br />* Don't be fooled by radon\daughters, which decay by half (always first subtracting background) in about 40 minutes. Radon is _bad_ stuff, I chart it, and I wonder about its comings and goings, but it's probably not coming from Japan. However, should your background readings take a big and sustained jump, or if you get a sample of something that keeps reading high the next day, you may have identified a problem.<br /><br />* Learn about your instrument's limitations. It's very hard to usefully read beta emitters in food, water or milk with any Geiger counter. That takes trained personnel, special procedures and expensive spectrometry equipment in a lab.<br /><br />Google \\"Radex-RD1503\\" + \\"SW Oregon\\" for the little bit I've managed to learn.<br /><br />Craig
0439023513|5.0|Some people hate Mockingjay because characters die and this dislike is really not fair to the author. Suzanne Collins was true to her characters and the world she created and that's the best gift any author of a series can give.<br /><br />Some have said that there was too much political background and it bored them. This is ridiculous. Hunger Games is a political novel filled with subterfuge and a message of freedom that's relevant to our world today. The novels couldn't have been plausibly written without the political background and intrigue. These scenes also gave important insights into Katniss and how her beliefs changed through the course of the series.<br /><br />When reading a series like the Hunger Games, you become involved. You fall in love with some of the characters and yes, it's hard to read about these beloved characters dying. However, it should have been obvious from the beginning that Collins doesn't pull her punches and there probably wouldn't be a normal happily ever after at the end of the series. It's called the Hunger Games for a reason. This series is set during a war. In wars there are casualties and they aren't always expected. The books were gruesome, not so much in an outright, in your face way, but in a more subtle, heartwrenching way. Mockingjay is no different. To end the series in any other way would have been a disservice to readers and to Collins herself. No one cares about these characters more than the author and if she was willing to sacrifice them to stay true to her vision, then I'm willing to shed a few tears reading through it.<br /><br />I commend Collins for making the touch choices even when it was hard so that her series could become something more than a pastime. Because of her dedication, it's become a revolution all its own.
B0042RJWTC|4.0|I discovered this series late. I started watching last fall on BBC America as a re-run of the Showtime series and started at the very end of season 2 when Anne Boleyn is executed. So I watched season 3 and 4, then purchased the series to go back and watch the first 2 seasons. I've been interested in British history for a long time but hadn't really looked much at the Tudor era even though I saw Elizabeth with Cate Blanchett. I really liked the Tudors, recognizing it is not totally historically accurate and despite a few minor flaws. The flaws...obviously Henry is not portrayed physically accurate. Much of the time line is erroneous and missing periods of time are not discussed. Examples: Princess Mary is portrayed as about 5 years old when she is sent away from court and the next time we see her she is a teen. I know that it took several years for Henry to marry Anne and when Elizabeth was born, but the time seemed longer than historically accurate. (Perhaps my timeline is faulty). Throughout the first season, discussions occur regarding Mary's betrothal to several potential husbands, but she is never married during the series and it is not really explained why the betrothals fell through. Due to wars, betrayals by other soverigns etc. During the first season, Henry, Brandon, Knivet and Compton are like the Four musketeers. But then the second season comes and Knivet is missing. Compton dies of the sweating sickness in season 1. But there is no mention of what happened to Knivit. We never see how Henry's leg is injured in a manner to cause him lifelong problems. It's described as \\"an old injury\\" but it has such an impact on him you'd think we would actually see what happened. Mary Boleyn is present in the first season but just disappears - maybe she was with Knivit - and doesn't reappear until near the end of season 2. Similarly, Thomas Tallis who is in season one is gone without acknowledgement in season 2. Perhaps he was finding his sexuality since in season one he is straight, then in a gay relationship with Compton, then straight again. There is quite a bit of sex in season one. Less so in subsequent seasons. It isn't needed, especially the scene with Wolsey and his \\"wife\\", but then it isn't offensive.<br /><br />The acting was pretty good. JRM was occasionally over the top as Henry with too much facial grimacing. Natalie Dormer portrayed Anne perfectly(as I envisioned her). Going from reluctance in being the object of Henry's affection, to loving the power she obtained as the Queen. Her facial expressions indicated absolute smugness and superiority.  Nick Dunning very good as Anne's power hungry father. And Henry Cavil....what can one say about him other than yowza. Henry and Anne together exhibited an almost animal passion or lust more than love.<br /><br />Season 3 brought Jane Seymour portrayed by Annabelle Wallis, assuming the role from Anita Briem. I would have been fine with Briem, but Wallis brought a softer much more gentle approach. I ended up liking her better and loved that she brought Mary and Elizabeth back into Henry's life. Anne of Cleves was a brief marriage that became a lasting friendship. Once divorced, Henry actually seemed to regret his hasty decision.<br /><br />Season 4 wound up the series with wives Katherine Howard and Catherine Parr. Katherine Howard was portrayed as a vapid valley girl who was only interested in dancing and new clothes....and Thomas Culpepper. Catherine Parr brought a elegant, genteel maturity to the court.<br /><br />Everyone agrees that there was much poetic license taken with this series, but as another reviewer said, if watching this series gets people interested in reading or viewing accurate depictions, this series is successful. I found it to be thoroughly enjoyable.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|First of all I would like to clear up certian things popping up in the negative reviews.<br /><br />1. This isn't a post-apocolyptic world, its following the collapse of the U.S. If you want world-in-disaster go read The Maze Runner Series.<br /><br />2. For those who believe that this would never happen, I hate to burst your bubble but, it did. In the ancient Roman times and in Dictator Joseph Stalin's time, the people bent on power would kill there rivals by making them commite suicide. How? The most important thing to sane people is there families. The people who wanted them dead would threaten to kill their families if they didn't kill themselves first. Also today people threaten to kill families if they don't get what they want. This book just has a different senerio to show it.<br /><br />Enough with the History lesson, this book is amazing. Full of twists and turns and well, practically everything that makes up a best seller.  Refering to my title, I really have never read anything like this and even when the knock-offs come they will be just that. When abook makes someone cry you know its good and at one part, I cried like a baby. Rather than reading my review you should be reading the book. Its worth it I promise.
B006P0FD4W|3.0|This third venture into the lives of sisters Kristi and Katie being haunted by a demon is more back-story than scary.<br /><br />You'll discover the origin of the Paranormal Activity. While the DVD boasts, \\"The last 15 minutes will mess you up for life\\" have no fear - it really won't. It just provides the explanation.<br /><br />Back in the 80s when Kristi and Katie were young girls, their mother, Julie, and her boyfriend, Dennis, move into a new home. Dennis videotapes weddings and so we have our collection of video recordings of how this new house is haunted.<br /><br />Kristi has an invisible friend named Toby and this thing wants something; least of all being called fat. (\\"Don't call him fat\\")  Katie doesn't believe Kristi at first. Then she plays Bloody Mary with Dennis' assistant and the house begins to come apart.<br /><br />While there are a few jump-in-your-seat scares, this film simply cannot recapture the building dread of the original. (But I will admit that a scare involving a closet did cause my heart to literally stop for a split second.) You'll get the multiple camera angels: two bedroom shots and the kitchen. You'll get the sudden kitchen scares and the camera-on-the-oscillating fan gimmick does provide a couple nice effects.<br /><br />They left enough story open in order to continue the saga if they wish (and they will).<br /><br />I remember being frightened by the original and then intrigued by the simple genius of the filmmakers. With the two sequels, I seem to have lost whatever \\"fun\\" I had. It's almost like the Matrix movies where the original was superb but the sequels were just too heavy for their own good.<br /><br />Sometimes I wish Hollywood would leave well enough alone and not rush sequels.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book has it all corruption, new characters, and action. As an avid reader I know a good book when I read one and Catching Fire was great. At first I thought it was copying the first book but then, I relized that this is what probably would happen in a corrupted country. They see someone as a threat to taking down the rule that made them rich and powerful so they try and destroy them. In this case by sending Katniss back to the arena, using the other Victors as a way of killing her.<br /><br />A real life example would be Julius Caesar and Ancient Rome's corrupted Senete.<br /><br />So for those who thought it was repetative, it was the only way Snowe could hold onto power and keep a grip on the districts. It happened as it would in real life.<br /><br />I would also like to throw in that the arena in this book is my favorite because it was a really clever idea. Just thought I'd throw that in there.<br /><br />Overall, two thumbs up!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app its great for days I'm really bored. my siblings lk to play it too whenever I go over there.
B003Y5H5B0|5.0|I recently started watching the original series, because I absolutely loved this movie. This movie is more of a continuation of the series, and reboots the franchise. It was hilarious from beginning to end. I cannot stress enough how epicly awesome this movie is. It's filled with dirty jokes, car-chases, gun-play and action. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum play Schmidt and Jenko. Schmidt was a nerd in high school, and Jenko was a dim-witted jock. Seven years later, they meet up again at the police academy. They become partners and assigned to park patrol. When they screw up, they are  reassigned to a revived specialty division on 21 Jump Street. They must go undercover as high school students and  stop a new synthetic drug from spreading to other campuses by finding the supplier. They get stuck in tons of hilarious situations. If you want the perfect buddy-cop comedy action film, you'll definitely love 21 JUMP STREET!!!
B004T2QZL8|5.0|Amazing game, and dedicated devs who put an update out on the same day it had the problem, really fun messing around with the combos.
B005CMSDKA|4.0|Many others have covered the plot and various details of the movie, so I will just say that I enjoyed it immensely - the stylish action (and apparently I'm enough of a film geek that I did exclaim with glee at the extended camera take of the scene with Erik going through the train station) was dazzling and Ronan does a great job. As much as a slender teen girl could possibly convince me that she is kicking full grown men's asses, she did. I do agree that the ending fell a bit flat, though it wasn't bad and had an appropriate parallel to the beginning.<br /><br />Hanna's journey in the movie is both external and internal, and just like in the best books, they reflect each other. Hanna has had an amazingly unique upbringing in which she learns and does things most youths her age will never know or experience. Much of the knowledge is superficial facts though, as her drone like recitation of her cover story shows. She can speak fluently in several languages and say that she's from Leipzig and has friends named Rudy & Gunter but she has no real idea what that means because she has never known any friends and sounds robotic when reciting the story. Physically she's unbelievably capable, but emotionally and socially she's limited at best. Thematically the film is as much about this internal journey to discover her humanity as it is about the external journey to evade Marissa's team and eventually avenge her mother. There are obviously some parallels to Luc Besson's movie Leon with Natalie Portman as another young woman assassin, but I also see parallels to Blade Runner and its story of outsiders - Rutger Hauer's Roy Baty character and his fellow replicants - trying to reclaim their humanity. (Hanna and BR also feature quite compelling visual styles and electronic scores for more parallels.)
B004T2QZL8|5.0|yes this app had issues earlier today but they obviously did not mean or expect it to have errors. it has since been updated and wish all the negative reviews could be removed
B006ZCWU5K|4.0|Bruce is not a musical innovator in that he does not try to cross new horizons or explore new territory with his music. What he does, and does best, is to produce very tightly crafted songs within the musical realm that he presides over. That is what you get with Wrecking Ball, a collection of well-written, well-produced songs that are quintessential Bruce Springsteen.  In addition to his typical fifties-style rock stomps and thoughtful, ruminating ballads, he adds some world-music flourishes, mixes in a gospel choir and even tosses in a brief rap performed by a guest artist. While not his best, Wrecking Ball is nonetheless a satisfying and often up-lifting hike through the familiar territory of Bruce-land. Familiar territory, yes, but comforting in its familiarity. Most Bruce fans should enjoy the trip and even non-fans should find many things to like along the way.

B005LZW8FO|2.0|To call \\"Another Earth\\" a science fantasy is misleading. Like \\"Melancholia\\" and \\"Gattaca,\\" its sci-fi story serves as basis for drama about humans. This is exactly where \\"Another Earth\\" disappoints because, in spite of the nice idea of \\"another earth,\\" the film's story about the two characters traumatized by the tragic events in the past is formulaic and unconvincing.<br /><br />In \\"Another Earth\\" Brit Marling plays a young woman Rhoda Williams. Having caused a terrible car accident because of her reckless and drunken driving, she spends about four years in jail. After she comes out of prison, she visits John Burroughs (William Mapother), a former Yale professor, who lost his wife and child in the accident Rhoda caused. She wants to apologize to him, but cannot bring herself to confess the truth.<br /><br />In the meanwhile, the world has been excited about the advent of a planet (called Earth 2) that looks exactly like the one we live on. The first contact through radio was established, and it is strongly suggested that on the blue plant, or \\"another earth,\\" another \\"we\\" are living.<br /><br />This poses an intriguing question: suppose Earth 2 is the projection of Earth 1 (or vice versa), what is the life of \\"me\\" on another planet would be like? Or, in Rhoda's case, did another Rhoda commit the same mistake and regret it? Or is she having a different life that Rhoda on Planet 1 might wishes for?<br /><br />Instead of developing the unique concept, however, director Mike Cahill (his feature debut) goes on telling the rather familiar story of Rhoda who gets involved (romantically) with John. John does not know anything about the one who killed his wife and child (which I think is more implausible than the existence of Earth 2). Rhoda, while being attracted to the person whose life she had ruined, thinks of traveling to Planet 2.<br /><br />We are told about these things, which could have been more convincing with less sluggish storytelling and more details about these characters. I like the concept of another earth, but to make it really effective it needs a better script than this.

B007FH9GT2|4.0|I have read the books and viewed all three Swedish films including the extended edition (the best version, in my opinion). This version of GWTDT was very good. I do prefer the Swedish adaptation for it's faith to the novel. However, I can't deny Fincher's film captures the atmosphere of the books. I never thought that I would see Lisbeth on screen. Noomi Rapace came exceedingly close. Rooney Mara is a completely different Lisbeth but is equally as compelling. The contrast in performance is as varied, multi-faceted, and perplexing as the character they portray. Noomi Rapace was more the restrained violent, angsty side of Lisbeth. Rooney Mara better captures the hidden vulnerability and need to be seen as a person aspect. I liked the rest of the cast, particularly Robin Wright Penn as Erika Berger. She fit more with what I pictured Erika being when I read the novels. The plot changes were carefully fit into the overall storyline and didn't alter the quality. Loved, Loved, Loved the opening sequence of this movie! It is worthy of your time, in my opinion.
B005FLX2WC|3.0|I liked this album well enough, but I felt it lacked a spark, or maybe a few more inspired songs that would have elevated it to greatness. Maybe it's because I read the rave reviews and had very lofty expectations for this album, that I feel slightly let down. But hey, even if it's not my very favorite album lately, it's still a good one. Of course Joe is the new guitar god, but for me the real draw here was listening to Beth Hart's singing. I particularly liked her covers of \\"I'd Rather Go Blind\\" and \\"Something's Got A Hold On Me\\" ... I think Etta would have approved.
B0013FXWU6|5.0|I love this dark movie. Daniel Day-Lewis does an outstanding job in his performance as Daniel Plainview. It is interesting to see how a man becomes morally bankrupt when he finds \\"a whole ocean of oil\\" under his feet that \\"no one can get at\\" except for him. The relationship between him and his son becomes quite interesting, especially as unexpected circumstances occur for the both of them.<br /><br />It is incredible how much can change when someone gets an opportunity of a lifetime, or something that they have been working toward for most of their lives as Daniel Plainview has. He finally gets it, and it changes him, and it's malignant. Some parts in the film, you undoubtedly agree with him, and other parts you wonder what is happening to him...who is he becoming?<br /><br />It is a long movie (at least it seems long), so I don't watch it a lot, but it is one of my favorite movies.
B0025UHKNS|3.0|I bought this on Amazon.com and was initially LOVING it. However the battery is rubbish. It JUST works after a full charge for a period of about 2 hours before dying. Fine if you are doing runs/activity near to your house but not if you have to travel and then want to use it.<br /><br />It has a clock but you could never use it as a watch for the day as it would just die after about 4 hrs.<br /><br />I think the main problem is that you can't turn off the satellites once you have started using it as GPS. That sucks the battery dry. If someone has a solution please let me know and I will edit this post but at the moment I'm kind of upset with this product for this reason.<br /><br />I shouldn't have to leave it on charge all the time when I decide to use it.<br /><br />Perhaps the seller sold me one with a duff battery<br />Or perhaps that is just the way this product is
B0050DIWFC|3.0|This book isn't bad. I read it in a day. I honestly thought it was predictable though. I could pretty much figure out what was going to happen before it happened. I found the mother to be annoying. The premise was interesting, and I thought the author could have done more with the topic.<br /><br />It was an okay book.
B006L9B6TI|4.0|Gratitude. It's something we could all practice more of. The original book and movie, \\"The Secret\\" spoke about it. This new book, \\"The Magic\\" talks a lot more about the attitude of gratitude, and the \\"magic\\" that comes from practicing it.<br /><br />In the week since buying it, and using the words \\"Thank you\\" (even for the things I'd just as soon hadn't happened), my life has changed for the better. Being thankful in the middle of trauma isn't always easy, but it is do-able. It's also not easy to be thankful when we have so much because we take so much for granted, but again, it is do-able.<br /><br />If you appreciated the original \\"The Secret\\" (book and/or movie), then you'll appreciate this newest offering from Rhonda Byrne. There is indeed something magical about the attitude of gratitude.

0307888908|5.0|I have absolutely appreciated this book. I've been freelancing for years and I'm graduating with a degree in media and I'd be lost without this book. First he starts out explaining how we all should think like entrepreneurs. We don't have to start businesses of our own but we should learn to deal with and take risk and always be looking for the next opportunities. This book does not help you write a resume but it helps you will all the areas that are important before you write one and before you go on an interview. You will breakdown your goals and aspirations to direct you path more accurately. The chapters about networking and finding opportunity are going to an invaluable resource to the reader.

1881273873|5.0|Until now I have known about the five love languages but didn't truly know them.  We've talked about them a handful of times in our Sunday School class, \\"The Call of Husbands\\" at church and I've known about them before then. They always seemed like a good idea and I had a decent sense of what my language was.  I wish I had read this book 10 years ago and taken it to hear then.<br /><br />This book helped to open my eyes much more to the dialects of the languages and why they are so important to learn and speak in all relationships, be it marriage, dating, work, friends, etc.  Gary Chapman outlines the importance of the love languages, especially by showing how relationships can fall apart without noting them and speaking the ones most needed. He also details what each language looks like and then talks about how we can apply them in our different spheres of life.<br /><br />The book was not as deep as I was hoping but it was decent and I am glad I bought and read it.  With story after story I was led to wonder if Chapman was just filling up space with ease and not really being as meaty as he could be.  That said, each chapter ends with some good questions to go over and at the end of the book is a valuable section of questions that are matched to each chapter, put together for small group study, though still worthwhile for an individual.

0312641893|5.0|Summary:  A play on the Cinderella story, Cinder is a cyborg in New Beijing.  Cyborgs are basically second class citizens, so her adopted mother treats her like dirt.  The great thing about Cinder is that she is an expert mechanic, so she has some freedom to run her own booth at the market.  While she is working, the prince, Kai, drops in to have her fix his android.  It is apparently a matter of national security.  Shortly after the prince leaves, there is a plague sighting in the market which closes everything down.  Once Cinder gets home, she walks in to find her two stepsisters getting brand new dresses for the ball.  The slight shift from the Cinderella story is that one of her stepsisters is actually a sweetheart.  After the fitting, Cinder and her stepsister go to the junkyard to find spare parts.  While there, Cinder's sweet sister breaks out in spots, showing that she has the plague.  This is one of the turning points of the story.  After this, Cinder's life is sold into plague research and she finds out all sorts of new things about herself.  It still has aspects of the Cinderella story, but strays more to make Cinder an intriguing character that you can't wait to find out about.  Her relationship with Kai blooms with short, interspersed run-ins, and the villain presents herself.  The villain is Queen Levana of Luna.  She wants to marry Kai to become empress, and will do just about anything to have those wishes come true.  If needing to know what happens between Levana, Kai, and Cinder doesn't make you interested in reading, then you need to know that there is a killer of a cliffhanger at the end.  It is wrapped up enough that you don't think the book was worthless to read, but definitely makes you crave the next installment of the series.<br /><br />My thoughts:  I've already strayed into my thoughts a bit.  I really enjoyed this novel.  I was skeptical going in and had put it off for awhile.  I've read a lot of re-imagined fairy tales and some are just not worth the attention.  This one definitely is.  It strays away from the typical tale enough that you don't really know what is going to happen, but stays close enough to the tale that the fairy tale elements are in place.  The good thing about me putting it off is that I have less of a wait for the next novel.  There are only two criticisms that I have.<br />First, there are parts that are extremely predictable.  Cinder's true identity is like a neon sign flashing above her head.  I can't imagine any reader being surprised about who she turns out to be.  This didn't both me that much.  There are a lot of very predictable novels that are still entertaining.<br />The second bit of criticism bugged me more.  There is not enough world building for me.  The setting is described a little, but part of the fun of science fiction and fantasy is being transported into another world.  I was disappointed by how glossed over the setting was.  Luna and the Lunars are barely described.  Also, Earth has changed and I want to know what I should be thinking about while the story is going on.  I think that Meyer spent more time developing Cinder and her personality than the world around her.  Since Cinder is a very good character, this holds the novel together, but I'd like to care more about the surroundings in the future books.  There are four more and I'm not sure that just loving Cinder is going to hold my interest through the story if I can't fully picture where I am.

B0002KPIKA|5.0|This opera by Handel is some kind of myth and legend. There are several versions running around. This particular production is remarkable because it uses one male soprano (Narciso) and two male altos (Nerone and Ottone). The result is admirable and has little in common with some current versions that have Nerone sung by a tenor and Ottone sung by a baritone. Or even versions with the same for Nerone and Ottone and a a tenor for Narciso. It is the great honor of Jean-Claude Malgoire to go back to the most brilliant period of Handel's career when he had three permanent castratos in London for operas like this Agrippina.<br /><br />The first element we have to point out is the music. This is one of the best operas by Handel. His music is creative, each instrument having its own color and the orchestra when playing alone melts these different instruments without erasing the characteristics of each one of them. It is a union of differences more than a homogenized mash. Malgoire is by far one of the conductors who have best understood this side of Handel's music and who is best able to render it. His desire to go back to the original version of the opera is by far a revolution in the field because this opera, like many others by Handel and other composers, has been dominated since the end of castratos at the end of the 18th century by tenors and baritones. The music was changed for that and we lost a lot of beauty.<br /><br />The second element is about the plot. In fact the plot is simple. Agrippina is manipulating everyone, including her official husband, Emperor Claudio, to impose her own son, Nerone, on the throne of Rome after Claudio's death. She has to eliminate Ottone who is the official choice of the Emperor, but also Poppea who is flirting with everyone, Nerone, Ottone and Claudio without understanding that she is ruining her own future and that of the man she officially loves, Ottone, who accepted the throne under heavy pressure from the emperor who tried to get Poppea in exchange. Ottone felt he could not refuse.<br /><br />Agrippina is going to use all means available to turn Claudio against Ottone first who is rejected when Claudio hears about his love affair with Poppea. He is accused of being a traitor and menaced with death. That's when Poppea realizes she is going to lose him for good. So she moves towards recapturing him. But Claudio will try a last attempt at punishing the treachery of Ottone by giving Poppea to Nerone and the throne to Ottone. But it is too late? Agrippina has won in the wings and Claudio is obliged to yield: the throne to Nerone, Poppea to Ottone and peace on the Roman hills.<br /><br />On the side Agrippina had to give a good thrashing to Nerone who was enamoured with Poppea instead of only thinking of the throne. He yields in anger and reveals there what he will be later. He is an angry young man at the end of the opera whereas he had been a lusty teenager all along. In the same way Agrippina is obliged to court Claudio into accepting to let Poppea go, though he had nearly raped her at the beginning of the opera.<br /><br />Some say it is the triumph of immorality. In fact this is a modern analysis. It is the triumph of political expediency in a dictatorial situation. When the choice of the future leader is left in the hands of one and only one man, it can only lead to intrigues and other forms of plotting. Everyone becomes the stylus on the plotter, and there are quite a few styluses.<br /><br />Now we have to consider the vocal rendition of the opera. I will center this approach on Nerone. Nerone is dressed in a striped suit that is more a costume than anything else, with light and dark marroon tending towards purple vertical stripes, with a corresponding wig.  His alto voice is higher than his mother's soprano voice and he is systematically shown as a teenager, at times a child, hardly out of puberty, lusty like a wild cat who only wants one thing: Poppea. His philosophy about sex is simple:<br /><br />\\"When a woman invites her lover, pleasure is in sight. If she says \\"come right away\\", what she means is \\"come and enjoy yourself\\".\\"<br /><br />In other words anything the girl might say will only have one value for the boy: run, jump, dive and enjoy. This pubertal child only reads the world through his lust and we understand that is not to please his mother who thrashes him when she learns, from him, that he has been rejected by Poppea. The thrashing is so effective that he grows into an angry young man at once with an extremely violent tune:<br /><br />\\"Like a cloud that flies from the wind, I forsake, disdained her face. The fire within my breast is now extinguished, my heart is free from  its chains.\\"<br /><br />His conclusion then when he finally knows Claudio's decision is just plain simple: \\"I am filled with joy!\\"<br />The use of a male soprano for Narciso is also a perfect choice because the first encounter of him and Agrippina at the very beginning of the opera, when she starts planning the succession of the emperor, makes her and her red wig and him and his maroon tending to crimson wig the perfect plotting couple. The two voices are nearly equal in range though very different in sexual harmonics, and the way he runs around in pleasure when accepting her mission, with little nearly effeminate steps, he looks like some kind of poodle running around the feet of his mistress. But the voice is essential: he is like the canine image of his mistress.<br /><br />The fact of having Ottone sung by a male alto is also very effective since he has several duets with Poppea who is a soprano. Once again in these duets the two voices are very close in range and yet very different in sexual harmonics. That gives to the numerous suffering moments in Ottone's part a depth and a languor that expresses pain marvellously and pushes Poppea's distant condescendence that is supposed to make him jealous, to a point where it becomes nearly sarcastic and even cruel. Ottone's voice is perfect for his rather frequent lamenting like in:<br /><br />\\"You who hear my lament, take pity on my suffering. I lose a throne which I despise, but my treasure, whom I prize so greatly, ah! To lose her is a cruel torture, which discourages my heart.\\"<br /><br />In this dominant environment of two sopranos, one male soprano and two male altos, the baritone of Claudio sounds like the booming cannons of the state, and the basses of Pallante and Lesbo sounds like more or less unimportant voices. Pallante's bass is amplified though to some density when he is confronted to Narciso, a male soprano, with whom he is planning to more or less prevent Agrippina from winning. There the contrast between the two voices is striking in the strong male harmonics of both and yet the distance in range.<br /><br />But the best part of the production is of course the costumes, the set and the stage direction; It is a show and a brilliant show at that. That's where the revolution of the DVD reaches far and wide. It of course brings the work to millions of people who could not see it in a theatre, and won't ever be able to see it, since operas too often have short lived lives in one place and rarely more, at times two or three with co-productions.<br /><br />But the DVD of this opera is superb because it uses the digital technique as a tool to enhance the show. We can see the conductor and the orchestra during the overture or the musical pauses, which is impossible for most spectators in an opera house. The shooting of the opera is using the volatility and the flexibility of the camera. It keeps frontal or semi-frontal points of view to retain the vision of the show the way spectators may have had it. But it constantly moves from a full stage capture to a close-up on a face, a character, the hands, the deportment of him or her with zooming in and zooming out movements but also with following the characters on the stage. There is even one instance when a close-up image ofthe character (Ottone) is superimposed on the right side of the screen that keeps a full vision of the stage with the same character singing alone in the middle.<br /><br />The fluid editing of these movements, in fact continuous shifting from a full stage view to a close-up capture of a character with a rather slow, certainly not brusque transitory zooming in and later zooming out is essential for the rendering of the real life of the show on the stage. The fluidity of the changes makes the shifting practically un-disturbing.<br /><br />At the same time the singing, the acting and all that is typical of a stage production is kept and the viewer then can and must keep his mental reflective distance, which is typical of such an opera. The only thing that is supposed to completely transport us is the music, but the music becomes a background, an environment, a surrounding wrapping, maybe an inner marrow of auditory pleasure that does not block our ocular vision and hence does not make this show an all-sensorial experience that would short circuit the mental reflective distance that is the means through and with which we capture the full beauty of the opera.<br /><br />To conclude here I will say that the CD is perfect for your auditory pleasure but the DVD is the acme of perception for your full enjoyment of the opera. And that is the second level of the DVD revolution. It enables these extremely rich, and by the way extremely expensive, shows to become a real and full experience to millions of people. More and more operas are captured on DVD within twelve months after the production, at times faster, since the operas will not go on tours and the DVD becomes a tremendous financial income. What's more the DVD can provide the audience with subtitles (the original ones) and a set of languages (English, German, French, Spanish), which is a good economy of scale when compared with the printed translations for the CD.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUone's voice is perfect for his rather frequent lamenting like in:<br /><br />\\"You who hear my lament, take pity on my suffering.

B006JTS5OO|5.0|The Muppets never disappoint and this movie sure doesn't either. What a great addition to what I already own- Muppets take Manhattan, Muppet movie and the 3 seasons of the Muppets.<br /> Short and Sweet Synopsis: Walter grows up adoring the Muppets while living in Smalltown with his brother (played by Jason Segel). He helps get them back on stage after years of not performing by finding Kermit and his friends. They have to fix up the stage although there are some challenges along the way ( Tex Richman is one). And Amy Adams is a delight who is brother's girlfriend who is wishing for her boyfriend to propose to him and have time alone with him.<br />The movie has a bunch of upbeat, catchy songs which my 3 year old son never tires of the song \\"Life's a Happy Song.\\" and the entertaining \\"Man or Muppet\\" sung by Jason Segel which one Best Song at the Oscars. I love the songs but some might find it cheesy.  I guarantee you it's a classic and a great family movie that brings me back to my childhood love of The Muppets. I thought there would be more bonus features in this pack but I got a $5 off coupon for this value pack so I have no complaints about getting a good deal!
1741798981|3.0|London is a huge, multilayered city and Lonely Planet's Guide does a good job of informing the prospective traveller that they're in for a shock if they're expecting London to be some exquisite gas-lit Victorian fantasyland. London is actually comparable to New York in terms of diversity and variety. This is an exceptionally thick book that mostly breaks London down by neighborhood and lists the notable sights, hotels, restaurants, etc. There are also some beautiful photographs. Clubs and live venues are well-described, and several seasonal activities that foreigners may not be familiar with (such as the Gorilla Run) are highlighted in the introduction. As such this is a very useful reference work and I found out things about London that I didn't know before.<br /><br />However, I also had several problems with this book. This prevents me from giving it a higher rating and, since it is a travel book, I want to make potential travelers aware of these problems.<br /><br />1)It's helpful to know which attractions permit photography and which don't. Not all London museums are photography-friendly and visitors should know this. I did not find this information readily available in this book. Furthermore, since we are living in an age of heightened security, public photography isn't as straightforward as it used to be. Again, travellers from places where snapshots aren't a big deal ought to be told this in advance to avoid spoiling their holiday with an unwanted conversation with a police officer.<br />2)A little more elaboration on the Tube would have been nice, since many visitors rely on public transportation.<br />3)I appreciated that most of the book was written by long-time Londoners. But there are often colloquial Britishisms that aren't explained and this could present problems for travellers who speak English as a second language. Think that's far-fetched? London is a truly international city and not everyone purchasing a travel guide in English necessarily speaksEnglish fluently.<br />4)The Olympics are being held in London in 2012. There are scattered references to this throughout the book but I think that for many 2012 visitors, a discrete section on the Olympics - and how they may impact your tourist activities if you are not going to London specifically for the Olympics - would be helpful.<br />5)The index isn't very complete. I had trouble finding many places that interest me, such as Abbey Road Studios.<br />6)The book itself is printed on rather thin, pulpy paper. I'm wondering how it will hold up during extended travel and reading.<br />7)The authors assume you will be in London for an extended stay. Not everyone's going to be in London for more than a handful of days, so having sections on more targeted tours based on interests would have helped.<br /><br />In sum, this is useful as a reference work, but not as a one-stop travel guide. I strongly suggesting buying one of the DK books and then possibly using this book as a supplement.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|Good thing it was free, cause that game sucked. I don't see the appeal of combining some items to make something new.
B001HNE3NO|4.0|A captivating read with reminders of a painful time we prefer to forget. The historical inclusion of the French participation really jarred my memories and feelings.
B004MRB2FO|1.0|I'll be brief.  This book is overhyped and very boring.  There is another page that offers comments on it.  Be sure sure to read all the reviews.  Start with the one star and don't bother with 4's and 5's.
B0007XT87G|5.0|If you like prog metal this CD is off the charts good.  Good mixture of melodic mellow music with tear into you metal.  Think King Crimson / Old Genesis mixed with Tool.
B004A8ZWT2|5.0|The Tourist is a delightful throw-back to the era of movies like \\"To Catch a Thief\\" and \\"The Pink Panther.\\" We have both of those movies on DVD and watch them regularly with renewed pleasure each time. This movie offers the same level of fun and adventure with the added benefit of Johnny Depp's natural ability to be funny; I have no difficulty placing him in the same category as Cary Grant and Peter Sellers. It has action, beautiful scenery, a well done script, effective character portrayal by Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie, good acting in the supporting roles, and a variety of interesting special features.<br /><br />We really enjoyed watching the film with one exception; the surround channels sound level sometimes masked the dialogue to the point we couldn't understand what was being said. There was, however, a simple solution; we activated the English subtitles and the problem was solved. (For the record all of the speakers are balanced within +/- 1 decibel)<br /><br />Both my wife and I enjoyed the movie and had fun watching it. If you're a fan of the Alfred Hitchcock movies or the Pink Panther movies I think you'll have fun with this one too.
B007M6P01O|3.0|The finale was decent- alot of zombies- and they finally got off the farm. If they spend next season only at the prison it will get drawn-out though. Outside of Rick, Daryl, and Andrea however the other characters are weak. It's not a good thing when you don't really care if most of the cast gets killed-off. Now they will bring Michionne in, but seriously wt heck is she doing out in the woods with hundreds of zombies around? And old man Herschel with that 100 round pump shotgun was too funny. Rick needs to get serious and give Carl a good ol' fashioned butt-whooping for all the mess he's caused and Lori is a bipolar biatch who needs to be served-up as zombie chow. T-dog -what the heck good is he? He's always wanting to go off on his own, and never does squat. Just kill him-off already. Carol, seriously-- Sophia was more useful. And now that we know everyone's infected already, who cares if you turn into a zombie upon dying and not by being bitten/scratched. Maybe they will introduce a new twist here. Well, let's see what season 3 brings. I'm hearing talk about the Russian army invading(the Spetsnaz forces were underground and not affected) what's left of the USA and shooting it out with our heroes... now that would be epic!

B004EPYZQC|5.0|In regards to the radical driving off a huge cliff scene.  I recently learned that it was popular for men to try to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge when it was first constructed. Survival from this jump was pretty dicey. Some guys made it and some didn't. The first guy to try it died when he hit the water 135 feet below. Others were knocked unconscious and had to be saved by boats in the water. One guy claimed to do it without anyone seeing him and then opened up a successful restaurant based on the fact that he jumped. So really with falls of that height it is going to be pretty much up to the individual.    With a 200 foot fall the likelihood of survival becomes even less but that's when you have to factor in who is falling in this movie. You're talking about Paul Walker and Vin Diesel. Obviously they can handle it. Vin Diesel is a guy that can jump a motorcycle 40 feet into the air without even trying. Paul Walker is a determined man that won't let countless obstacles stop him from finding his dogs, you think a two hundred foot fall is going to stop him? Come on get serious.    look for my full review at  [..]

B0034G4P94|5.0|I just saw warrior on Saturday night I think and yes I almost cried during the final scene. Rarely in film do you see such a powerful mix of awesome fighting and legitimate acting. Its as if they wrote a movie for Vin Diesel and Paul Walker but instead decided to cast real actors. Rarely do I see a film where upon finishing it I immediately watch the final scene again. Rarely do I stand up and cheer in my home during a movie. Rarely do movies teach such powerful lessons like - never tap out until your opponent says \\"I love you.\\" I'm a little hesitant to say this but I think Fast 5 has just taken a step down the list of my favorite movies of 2011. Warrior is now number 1.    <...>
B005PR2FD8|5.0|This is triumphant return of Tekken since it's first anime release \\"Tekken : The motion picture \\" back in 1998. This is a must -have for any Tekken fan!
B00005QZWI|5.0|LOTR is my favorite book and also my favorite movie and I have listened to some of the songs on YouTube from the soundtrack, so I knew before I ordered it that this was going to be a really great soundtrack. Plus that, in my opinion, the music is one of the many best things about these movies. Listening to the soundtrack almost feels like you're actually watching the movie, since most of the songs are in the movie in their entirety. And if you know the movies as well as I do, you learn to listen for things like that.<br />The Prophecy, the first song, is the only one that doesn't really appear in the movie, but one could probably imagine it to be the soundtrack if the creating of the Rings were shown in more depth in the movie. Concerning Hobbits, otherwise known as \\"Shire music\\", is where Gandalf comes to the Shire and Bilbo writes in the Red Book of Westmarch. Shadow of the Past is the part where Bilbo leaves the Shire and Gandalf tells Frodo about the Ring. In The Treason of Isengard, Saruman reveals his betrayal and imprisons Gandalf in Isengard. The Black Rider is the scene where Frodo and Sam meet up with Merry and Pippin and see the Nazgul for the first time. The Sign of the Prancing Pony is where the hobbits come to Bree and meet Aragorn, and A Knife in the Dark is the scene on Weathertop where Frodo gets stabbed by the Witch-King of Angmar. Flight to the Ford is where Arwen gets Frodo to Rivendell.<br />Many Meetings is the beginning of Book II (in the book), where Frodo wakes up and visits with Bilbo. The Council of Elrond is obviously the council of Elrond, and also includes Aniron (the song where Arwen gives Aragorn the Evenstar). The Ring Goes South is where the Fellowship leaves Rivendell, and Journey in the Dark is where the Fellowship journeys through Moria and finds Balin's tomb. The Bridge of Khazad Dum is that awesome scene where the Fellowship runs down the stairs and Gandalf fights the Balrog. Lothlorien is the Fellowship's stay at Lorien, and The Great River is the Fellowship's journey down Anduin. Amon Hen is the part where Boromir tries to take the Ring from Frodo and the fight with the orcs where Boromir gets killed. The Breaking of the Fellowship is where Frodo and Sam leave to Mordor, Boromir's funeral, and Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli going after Merry and Pippin. It also includes In Dreams, which is featured in the credits. Lastly is May It Be, the credits song by Enya, and that's basically a three-hour movie boiled down to an approximately one-hour soundtrack. In the jacket is lyrics from the songs that have lyrics in Elvish with their English translations.
B005KR6OBM|5.0|Love Big Bang Theory. It is one of the best TV shows out there. I don't watch very much TV, but I find this show to be very entertaining. Great cast and great comedy. :)
B004XISI4A|5.0|I could not put this book down, having just read the other 4 books earlier it was great to get back to all of the characters and let the saga continue. Anyone who would like a series of books that they will not be able to put down this is it. I cannot wait for the sixth book to come out not that I want to put pressure on George R,R,Martin but come on my friend get writing I cannot wait. You have such a mix of characters some you love and some you just keep waitng for them to get their comeuppence,then you do a turn around and some of those beloved characters are no longer so lovable. Great writing gets you in and you don't want it to end. I highly reccommend this series to all.[[ASIN:B003YL4LYI A Dance with Dragons: A Song of Ice and Fire: Book Five]][[ASIN:B004JN1D2I George R.

B004LWZW7Y|1.0|Saw this in the movie theater with my son.  I found the Shrek movies good, or at least entertaining.  Figured this would be similar.<br /><br />But it's just not good.  Just boring and the funny moments are few and far between.  The beginning is mildly entertaining, but the rest of it was just a waste of time and money.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|great features, no freeze ups like other Bible apps and FREE! like all the study plan options and ability to make notes
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|Lovely movie, fresh, original, intense. It's Woody Allen's masterpiece. After so many movies now he díd it. I love it.  Highly recommend!

B006MQRLSA|3.0|I like the movie very much, it is very inspiring.<br />But too bad there is no closed caption, not good for someone who don't quite understand English very well
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Fun and addicting. I am motivated to play all the games. By having to buy the games with the points earned from each game...I want to play all the time.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I love this game. However, it is very hard to play it when it force closes every time I try to play.
0385534639|3.0|First let me say that I had read too much about this book before its release and my expectations were very high. That is why I feel let down. I eagerly awaited this book. I had read so many amazing accolades about it, and so I expected something amazing. What really brought me to buy this book was that so many publishers recommended this book as \\"the next Harry Potter\\"... This was the biggest let down. I understand that both contain \\"magic\\" but that does not put them in the same class.<br /><br />I would consider this book to be for women. By that i mean the whole plot is driven by love. I'm not against this, but again my expectations were set to expect an adventure or something a lot more exciting.<br /><br />The book is very well written, and the nonlinear style made it very engaging. It took a while for the story to captivate me, but near the end I could not put it down.<br /><br />I DO recommend this book, but understand it is NOT a \\"new Harry Potter.\\" It is more of a Nicholas Sparks sappy love story with magic throughout (and unfortunately that is not my choice of reading). I can understand why so many people love it, but I already gave the book to my mother and told her to keep it.
B004T2QZL8|2.0|Very fun game, but needs an update. The force closes are very frequent and annoying. Amazon needs to fix these problems quickly, or else the app is worthless.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I got this game for my kindle fire.  It's great. Totally recommend.  Downloaded fast.  Installed fast.  I like that it submits the score online, so there's competition involved.

B004T2QZL8|4.0|I found that once I completely uninstalled and reinstalled the app, it worked perfectly.  Very fun game!  The graphics are excellent, the quotes are amusing, and the controls are snappy.  Much nicer interface than alchemy.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|this was very first app on k-fire. it has good graphics. good archery. the only problem is the ads.Other than the ads. THIS GAME IS AWESOME!  and it's kid approved and take it from me I am a kid.
B004T2QZL8|4.0|after the update I didn't have the force close problem anymore. thanks for fixing it.  this game is fun and addicting to figure out the different combinations.
B006JTS5OO|5.0|There is no better word to describe this movie other then charming! The muppets are back...fresh and renewed. What made this movie so charming was its ability to poke fun at itself. The plot of the movie is so true to the francise (make big bucks or disney will scrap you) that it immediately grabs you. For those that grew up with the Muppets the nostalgia will warm you and for new generations the modern feel with appeal to them. Its a wonderful movie and I highly recommend.<br /><br />\\"It obvious...its predictable...its campy...its....The Muppets. . .we loved it!\\" -Waldorf & Statler
B004T2QZL8|1.0|id try to make a new element and everytime i put two together it would go black and say i have to close it!!!!! spool frustrating!!!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great Bible study, only issue is when wi-fi isn't available. Then it sometimes won't open.  Otherwise great selection of versions and studies.
B00005ASOC|5.0|\\"Finding Forrester\\" is one of my favorite movies.  Sean Connery depicts an author who has achieved the pinnacle in writing- which is writing the great American novel.  Then, he realizes the high expectations of others discourages him from writing another novel.  He writes one great book.  For some reason, it reminds me of Harper Lee.  She wrote one of the best novels in history- \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\"- her only novel.<br /><br />As far as the movie, it is quite intriguing and interesting.  The story weaves seamlessly and smoothly.  This movie seems to appeal in the writer in people.  Whether we want to write a novel or an essay, we can write a great piece of literature just like making a great jump shot.<br /><br />JR Felisilda<br />Author of the book, \\"Nanay: Lessons From a Mother\\"
B002MQYOFW|5.0|When I first started reading this series I did it because I had seen so many other people reading it. Including my math, social studies, and english teachers reading it. The first . . . I dunno, two (?) chapter that I read were boring as hell. Well, actually, I wouldn't say boring was the right word, but slow. But after that it becomes so addicting it is UNBELIEVABLE!!! :D Exciting and exhillarating. Although violent, even my most squeamish friends could not bear to put it down from start to finish. I  wouldn't say that Katniss is cruel or that Suzanne Collins is making it so that she has no sympathy or compassion for anyone outside her circle of trust-- because she does, but merely that Katniss -- and everyone around her -- have been accustomed to death and cruelty from the moment they were put into the world. She's accustomed to seeing people drop dead on the streets due to starvation on an annual basis. I also think that that's why so many people are being sucked into the books--because we are forced to ask ourselves if this really would be us watching people die and not do anything about it because we knew we would have to take care of ourselves first. Because we put ourselves in that situation and regretfully know that we really would be the ones watching people die in the streets and do nothing about it. For reasons unknown to me or most likely anyone else, humans have always been completely and utterly infatuated withe idea of violence, crime, tragety, murder and death while also feeling trust and kinship to those we love and care about. But what I personally love most about Katniss is that she would give up her life and innocence for her little sister, and also kill while doing it. The plot is absolutely riveting.<br /><br />It is official; I. Love. The Hunger Games.<br /><br />That being said -- TEAM PEETA!!!

B000MQC9H4|1.0|I was extremely disappointed in this item.  Had looked forward to viewing the movie but, after inserting it in DVD player, it refused to play.  I even had someone else try it on their DVD player.  It would have taken me the expense and inconvenience to return it so I just called it a loss !!  I sent feedback - never got a response.  Will not order from this seller again.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I absolutely love this game.  It is extremely additive and very difficult to put it down.  Limited skills. required to play.
B007M6P01O|5.0|This was the most interesting episode of them all in Season 2.  I am happy with the change of pace, introduction of new characters, and depth of characterization dealing with such a stressful complex emotional experience.  A+ by me ....I can't wait for season 3! I'm back on the train \\"ALL ABOARD\\"!
B003Y5H5HY|3.0|Loved the books, loved the original films, generally love Fincher's style and direction. This is a well-made film for Americans who haven't read the book or seen the original film. 50 minutes in I was bored and wanted to turn it off, but I wanted it to get better so I left it on. The movie stayed on and I folded laundry.
0802473156|5.0|Chapman addresses an area of love that is not discussed enough!  There is so much more to staying in love other than just staying married.  He discusses a common pattern in all relationships that i was never able to identify before reading his book.  Great book for feedback and insight from your partner also.
B004GHYCKW|1.0|I purchased this album two weeks ago... As a huge P.J. Harvey fan I feel as though this album was a complete waste of money and I could not get a connection to even one song. I don't know why she made the decision to change her style in such a different way but she doesn't even sound like the same person. I noticed the change a little in the album White Chalk but this was by far the worst CD I have ever purchased.
B004EPZ03O|5.0|It's time to play the music! It's time to light the lights! The Muppets hits Blu-ray shelves this week, after injecting new life into the moribund franchise. Jason Segel stars as a Muppet fanatic who teams with his little brother Walter to track down Kermit, Miss Piggy, Fozzie, and the rest of his heroes. Their mission takes on a greater urgency when evil oil baron Tex Richman plans to demolish the old Muppet Studios and drill for black gold. The solution? Why, get the gang back together and put on a show, of course! Clever, charming, and heartfelt, The Muppets is a welcome big screen return for Jim Henson's lovable creations that will both win new fans and delight longtime devotees.
B004T2QZL8|2.0|Got 2 stars because I see the potential to be fun, but locked up phone and force closes make it quite unplayable. If it ever reaches a more stable state, it would be nice to not have the element categories close after a successful pairing.
B006QVRVJK|3.0|Here's a recipe for tension: put Jodie Foster, John C. Reilly, Christoph Waltz, and Kate Winslet in a room, add a pinch of disagreement, simmer, and serve. Roman Polanski's Carnage sticks to those particulars throughout its 80-minute runtime, and though I found it a bit too stage-bound to truly take flight as a film, I simply enjoyed watching these four fine actors rip each other to shreds. A pair of married couples meets for a polite chat after a playground dispute between their respective children. However, it isn't long before any veneer of civility is stripped away, and the situation devolves into an out-and-out cage match of verbal sparring and bitterness. It isn't as compelling on the screen as it was on the stage, but Carnage makes up for its flaws with Polanski's smooth direction and assured performances from Winslet and Foster.
B006ZCWU5K|5.0|First of all, some context. I have been a huge fan and admirer of Springsteen's work since the day my best friend and I dropped the needle (yes on an LP) of Springsteen's new release (yes I am this old)--Darkness on the Edge of Town. It was instant shock and awe--Badlands, Adam Raised a Cain, the awesome title track--nothing to do but flip it over and listen to it again immediately. Then, on The River tour I experienced the magic of my first Springsteen show. The ticket (I still have the stub) states I paid $10.50 to sit in the nosebleed section. Still, hundreds of concerts later, I can honestly say those four hours were some of the most transcendent moments of rock and roll I have ever witnessed.<br />So no, I am not the most objective reviewer, but I don't blindly love everything he does either. I didn't think Tunnel of Love, Human Touch or his previous two albums were more than OK.<br />That said, I assert this is his best album since The Rising. Since I was unimpressed with about half of Magic and most of Working on a Dream, that alone is not enough priase. I would say it is up to the caliber of his best three albums (in my opinion)--BTR, Darkness and The River.<br />What really impresses me here is the diversity of material, lyrically and musically. This is the same Springsteen who wrote \\"Seeds\\" and the \\"Ghost of Tom Joad\\" album, looking at the world around him and expressing his concern and outrage for the disenfranchised, those beaten down by a system that doesn't work as well as we preach it does.<br />\\"We Take Care of Our Own\\" drips with the same sad irony of \\"Born in the USA.\\" Songs like \\"My Depression\\" and \\"Jack of all Trades\\" are mini-tragedies from one of our finest songwriters, the rock music equivalent of John Steinbeck.<br />Do not miss this important album--hey, it also rocks often and the music is a lot of fun!
B003Y5H5HO|4.0|Lately, it seems, if you're looking for remake fodder, Scandinavian cinema is where it's at. Christopher Nolan mined Norway for Insomnia, and Matt Reeves went to Sweden for Let Me In, both of which turned out to be rousing successes. Enter David Fincher, who last year helmed the American version of another Swedish property, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, an adaptation of Stieg Larsson's global bestseller of the same name, and came out with a great hit of his own. The story, for those unfamiliar, revolves around a disgraced journalist who enlists the help of a rebellious young hacker in hopes of unraveling the mystery behind a decades-old missing persons case; as they dig deeper, they uncover a vast conspiracy with far-reaching implications. With material here that fits squarely within his wheelhouse, Fincher succeeds in translating the Swedish hit for American audiences, complete with all the lurid details, the unabashed brutality, and the wholly committed performance from his lead actress.
B0052VUNHC|4.0|Abby and Travis had an explosive relationship from the beginning of the book. Abby has a father who is a gambler and drinker that teaches Abby the same traits she is tired of this life an leaves for college without telling him where she is.  She meets Travis who has the some of the same traits as her father with gambling and drinking, he also has a bad thing for dating and sleeping with different women.  They become fast friends, than to lover and than to fighting breaking up to getting back together.  The book is pretty good, but I also think it was a little to long, because the story line with back and forth to much for me.
B0059XTTW8|4.0|Former intelligence officer and British author John le Carre has seen seven of his novels brought to the big screen; Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, based on his 1974 novel of the same name, is merely the latest adaptation of his work. In a brilliant performance, Gary Oldman plays a British Intelligence officer who is brought out of retirement to investigate allegations that a mole exists within the organizations upper ranks. Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy has a great screenplay, score, and what I consider to be Gary Oldman's finest performance to date. Though I felt the plot was a tad difficult to follow, with its myriad twists and turns, the film is a rewarding experience, filled with nuanced performances and an engrossing premise. It's certainly worth a watch for anyone into high-stakes espionage stories.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Adele is my new favorite singer. The way she changes her voice is phenomenal. \\"Set fire to the rain\\" brings tears to my eyes.
B00466HN6S|1.0|If you were sad that the world had yet to see an animated/live-action hybrid film catering specifically to crowds anticipating the secular aspects of Easter, chin up! In the grand tradition of films like The Smurfs and Alvin and the Chipmunks comes Hop, the tale of a CGI rabbit who dreams of becoming a drummer and instead crosses paths with a slacker human with a surprising knack for delivering Easter candy to kids the world over. Let's be honest here: Alvin and the Chipmunks made over $350 million worldwide at the box office and spawned two sequels, and Hop made over $180 million itself. In other words, even though the movie was horrible, it's pretty clear I am not the target demographic. Want something silly and formulaic to babysit the kids while you tend the barbecue? Here you go.

Up until now, my favorite book on the subject has been Schopenhauer's [[ASIN:0486440117 Essay on the Freedom of the Will (Philosophical Classics) (Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences Winner)]], a similarly short work.  Now Harris has come along with an equally cogent essay (I was glad to see that Harris refers to Schopenhauer in the footnotes, quoting Einstein, a Schopenhauer fan).<br /><br />I especially liked Harris's demolishing of his friend Dennett's convoluted attempt to \\"save\\" free will.  Harris has no patience with such dances, whether the subject is free will or religion.  He's the enemy of all muddled thinking, which is so refreshing.
B006OAB3ME|5.0|This is a GREAT CD by Paul, ESP. the song MY VALENTINE....it truly IS one of his best. Of course, Paul has been my favorite Beatle since I was in grade school when they first hit the US. Even then, I thought he was ....the coolest...even before I REALLY understood what being cool was. So yes, I really like this CD, and plan to share it with a close friend.
B006PAZMMK|4.0|I don't really get the ballad at the end..I figured it would at least have some modern touches or a dub step twist...but it just sounds like a regular movie soundtrack backdrop for Disney or something..i dunno.  The other songs are good, great for partying, not really inspiring though...not for me anyway..except for Summit-(AMAZING)which is why I bought the album to begin with. ;)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|really fun and really cool. I loved it it was amazing to play. I shared it with my friends and family
B005RZ8WIA|5.0|all reviews of this cd and band are spot on!!!!!! volbeat takes rock,metal,punk and country and blends it into the best music I've heard in 30 years. this band is going to be huge!! I have had this cd for a month and it has not come out of my cd player.  By far the best metal/rock band out there. Buy this or any other volbeat cd you will thank me later!!
B004ZY0VHY|1.0|I started reading this book, and was finding it very hard to get into. I came to the reviews to see if I was off the mark, and evidently I am. I will go back to reading, hopefully as it progresses, I will become accustommed to the format, and be able to finish and give a correct review.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I loved this book!  It has been a while since I read something that kept me up til 3 am because I just couldn't put it down.  The characters are so well-developed and I began caring about what happened to them within the first few chapters.  The descriptions of scenery and people grabbed my imagination while the fast moving plot kept me involved in the story.  My only complaint is that I have to wait until July to hear what is next for Diana and Matthew!
B005WMQ5R8|5.0|I pre-ordered the blu-ray version before the reviews came up here and I have already watched the movie 3 times, it's just that amazing.  The Artistic style reminds me of a mix between Tri-gun and Cowboy Bebop.  The action is always at the max with the ridiculous racing and sound effects.  The audio is great on a 5.1 Surround sound and the Video quality is the best I've seen in any anime to date.<br /><br />For the anime fans you probably already have it but for people on the edge, take a chance you won't regret it.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|This game is flippin' rad! I got into the 50's on my evo 4g before the force closes started. But every time I've found a game with that issue, in time it was fixed. It's a great game!
B005UBNL0A|5.0|I stack up my PC with this CPU and a $50 Gigabyte motherboard and 4GB DDR3 Ram as I was building a budget desktop. my PC been working like a charm with WIN 7 and since the very first boot, I have never had a freeze, blue screen, or any other issues. The CPU is powerfull, and I can run any program including Photoshop fast with no lags. I can imagine if this CPU is with a higher end motherboard, will most likely function much better.<br /><br />Overall I'm glad that I bought this CPU. Fair price for a nice performance. I probably would have had to pay about $80 more to get an Intel CPU with same performance.
B003INBOE2|5.0|AMAZING!!!  The IP Man series is among the best of traditional martial-arts. I hightly recommend these movies Donnie Yen is great!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Great character development, riveting story and a great buy all around. I couldn't put it down. So good! It was really easy to buy this book for my Kindle Fire because it downloads all on its own.
1451627289|4.0|At the half-way point I would have given this book 5 stars.  The premise and characters were riveting, and the more King explores small-town America in the 50's and 60's, the better the story gets.  It really goes awry, though, when Mr. King drags us back to the Oswalds and seems to feel obligated to force the reader to engage with characters and story line that I, for one, no longer cared about.  I started out wanting to see what happened if Kennedy lived; then I got to know the story's small town characters and basically was fine just living with Jake in the world he was inhabiting and changing.  The ending feels rushed, convoluted, and lacked the thoughtfulness the rest of the book displayed.  Kind of soured my feelings about the book, because the title seemed a promise broken.  But the majority of the story was very good, so on balance I'd give it four stars.
1451648537|5.0|This is a highly readable book, thoroughly researched and brilliantly written. It gives an intriguing insight into the life and mind of Steve Jobs, a truly creative genius. Anyone interested in Steve Jobs and his amazing company, Apple, cannot fail to read this book.
B00356CO1E|5.0|I have never been a great athlete, so I let myself slide and got more out of shape than I care to admit. But I get so bored at the gym! Thankfully I read the reviews of Jillian's 30 day shred, and I am never going back! I'm on my third week and I can't believe the difference - I've lost inches! The workout is intense, but even though I suffer from thyroid problems, I can get through it and feel great.  I am going to stick to this and I can't wait to try Level 2.

B007IQX1G4|5.0|This is a movie meant for a very particular audience, so it's not surprising that the comments are so love-it-or-hate-it.<br /><br />It's a movie about the following cultural clashes:<br />(1) anonymous urbanity versus small town reputation;<br />(2) high-achieving individualism versus comfort-seeking community life;<br />(3)needs-fulfillment versus love-and-sacrifice.<br /><br />The movie initially paints a bleak picture of contemporary urban individualism; returning to her home town makes her appear shallow. But ultimately she realizes that she can't live like them because she is better than them.<br /><br />Movies that appear similar in the trailer (like Sweet Home Alabama) usually conclude that traditional community life is The Good Life. This movie reaches exactly the opposite conclusion.<br /><br />So if you want to believe in traditional love, family and community, you will hate this movie. It's a movie for the rest of us.
B004T2QZL8|2.0|There are so many errors. as soon as I combine two elements, the game errors. I have to allways resteart for it to work again.
B0073LWEXK|4.0|I like this game:) it's a lot different than others and I really actually enjoy playing this game. in the beginning it's a little difficult and confusing but once you get the hang of it, it works out.
B004T2QZL8|2.0|Got this as a free app of the day and enjoyed tinkering around with it until it started to force close constantly after I reached a certain point. I tried reinstalling it, because I have found that to work with other troublesome apps in the past, but now I can't even get it to install again. If they can  fix the bugs this would be a fun little time killer.

B0059XTTW8|2.0|Poor George, as Connie Sachs would have said.  This movie has to be the most misconceived adaptation of a great book ever.  I'll tell you up front, I am a huge fan of le Carré's work of the 60s and 70s, and in particular of the Smiley/Karla trilogy.  The 1979 Alec Guinness BBC television treatment was a masterwork.  This movie, bluntly put, sucks.<br /><br />First and foremost, the characters are badly cast and poorly played by (mostly) good actors who should know better.  In particular Gary Oldman as George Smiley is terrible.  He is made up to look more than anything like Lloyd Bridges after he picked the wrong week to stop sniffing glue in \\"Airplane.\\"  While Guinness became Smiley 30 years ago, Oldman plays the part without displaying the least bit of insight into the character.  William Hurt turns Control into a scenery chewer.  The nonentity who plays Peter Guillam looks 20 years too young for the part and the rest, including Colin Firth, who plays Bill Haydon without demonstrating any understanding of the depths of his character's complexity, just bumble and mumble along almost anonymously.  Don't even get me started about what is done to Connie Sachs.<br /><br />Almost as sadly baffling is the completely pointless meddling the writers of the instant screenplay did with the sacred text of le Carré's book.  Czechoslovakia becomes Hungary...why?  Jim Prideaux is shot pretty much apropos of nothing but ominous music at a Budapest cafe instead of by Russian troops tipped off to his mission in a remote Czech forest...why?  Ricki Tarr dallies with Irina in Istanbul, not Hong Kong...the list goes on.  The changes in the main do nothing to promote efficient presentation, they simply seem like gratuitous, err...tinkering.<br /><br />If you enjoyed the book or the Guinness version of the movie, please, please don't buy this completely unworthy effort.  Why le Carré allowed himself to be associated with it is beyond me, but then his books written after the trilogy doshow a substantial decline in the author's clarity of thinking.  John le Carré lost his way in a series of increasingly tedious books written from the 80s on, but he was writing at the top of his form in Tinker Tailor.  Alec Guinness left us with the performance of a lifetime in a movie that defined the spy genre.  The 2011 version is, by comparison, a sad mistake that deserves to be quickly and mercifully forgotten.
B004UID2LC|4.0|This app is a big help on downloading music onto my Kindle Fire. The sound quality is the same as the video and there's no problem in the process. But, there is one thing that bothers me. It's the fact that when I downloaded my first three videos and watched them, I went back to download more and all ot said was &quot;Searching&quot; and it didn't even START to download. So, I cant download any more videos.... Otherwise, if you want music quick and easy, this app is awesome.

B005LAIH2W|5.0|It's a huge shame that the public have heeded a few nasty critics and not gone to see John Carter in theaters! I LOOOVE this movie! I've seen it five times and want to go again! It's been years since I enjoyed a film this much and missed it so much in between viewings that I couldn't wait to go again! The cast is fabulous, the story smart and not dumbed down, but so thrilling it totally pulls you in! If you're a fan of the original books written 100 years ago by Edgar Rice Burroughs, or if you've never even heard of the story John Carter is based on, you will enjoy this movie! It's epic and even if people don't go see it in theaters, they will discover its magic on DVD / Bluray after and regret having waited! It's definitely a film that is best viewed on the Big Screen! It is sad that it didn't reach blockbuster status, as it should have, but John Carter is headed for cult classic status! Go Barsoom!! :D

B004EBT5CU|5.0|The title states it all.  She is amazing.  I can listen to this disc beginning to end<br />and every track is pure gold.

B005LAIH2W|5.0|I read Edgar Rice Burroughs' (the creator of Tarzan) Mars series when I was a kid and have wanted to see it as a movie (movies) ever since. About 30 years later, it appeared. It was worth the wait. It was amazing, the actors were spot on, the FX were great, the whole package. You may have heard this movie \\"ripped off\\" Star Wars and many other movies or books. The truth is, without John Carter and his princess, and the world that ERB created, there would not have been a Star Wars or just about any other epic science fiction story we've enjoyed over the last 100 years.<br /><br />Ignore the reviews, ignore the fact that Disney has barely acknowledged they even made the movie and go see it. Our kids (age 10 and 7) and a friend (11) loved it as much as I did.  The first word I heard (after them watching it in almost silence, well, not counting cheers and laughter at the funny parts), riveted to the screen - and if you knew these three kids - you'd be in shock) was \\"Again!\\" from our 7 year old son.<br /><br />We rarely buy DVDs since getting Netflix, but this is one I will buy.

B003Y5H5HY|1.0|I just wanted to add my frustration regarding the \\"digital copy\\" aspect associated with this package.  I purchased with the belief that a digital copy would mean that I could download and use on my portable device.  That is not the case at all.  The only download capability is to your computer.  I agree with the other reviewer.  I should have purchased the HD version from iTunes.  It is $2 cheaper and I could play everywhere.<br />The movie by the way is very good and I would rate it 5 stars.

0061726834|5.0|Delirium by Lauren Oliver<br />'''''<br />Lena was counting down the days until she could get the cure for the \\"disease.\\" Love was considered a disease called Deliria, and the government eradicated it with a procedure they created.  Lena believed that Deliria was bad and couldn't wait for her birthday so she would be safe, but, before she could get the cure, the unimaginable happened:  she fell in love, which changed everything.<br /><br />I have the Deliria; I loved this book.  I can't imagine a world without love. I'm a hopeless romantic, so that seems unthinkable. For a book about the nonexistence of love, it was a beautiful, heartbreaking love story.  The author's words touched my heart and had me holding onto each word like a treasure wanting more.<br /><br />I was easily pulled into the story. It was an especially connective read for me when I discovered it was set in Portland, Maine. I live in the Portland area, and I know it very well. I recognized most of the streets that were in the story and could picture the scene, which was pretty fascinating. I've never read a book where I've known the area that it was set in, especially a specific spot. I'm very curious about why the author chose Portland, Maine. I really enjoyed reading about a dystopian version of Portland.<br /><br />-Christie's Book Reviews
1451683405|4.0|Sam Harris can do no wrong, at least so far. Once again he delivers an extremely rational, clear and concise book. This time about one of our most cherished notions, free will.  Harris doesn't waste much time going over other philosophers arguments and although he mentions some scientific experiments (Libbet, W.Grey and more), he doesn't analyze them in depth. What he does is explain why free will can't possibly exist using simple logic.  The truth of the matter is that we are not aware of the neuronal events that precede our mental states. This is indisputable since we cannot account for what emerges into our consciousness. It really is as simple as that. For people who are not familiar with this subject and are not readers of Harris blog this is a great book.<br />And those who are well read in the subject will probably enjoyed it too, I did. My only complaint is that I wish Harris had gotten a little more into the implications of free will being an illusion. He does explain how morality can work but I'm much more interested in how it affects our every day to day lives, as well as our relations with others. But I'm pretty sure that would be a whole book in itself and here Harris seemed to be more interested in simply debunking the nonsensical notion that is free will.<br /><br />Recommended.

B001XRLWPQ|5.0|For years, the reality (no comment) and \\"abbreviation/acronym\\"-based shows (L&O SVU, CSI, CSI: NY, NCIS, NCIS: LA) ruled the ratings, and I have to admit, I liked (and still like) many. However, this year seemed to offer something new and different. \\"Castle\\" (and \\"Revenge\\", though unrelated except for both being on ABC) show what writers can create when not constrained by too many stereotypes of what a popular/profitable show should be. Yes, there are legitemate challenges that it is a stereotypical \\"ensemble police dramedy.\\" However, I believe the performances of many of the characters overcome any complaint of the show being unoriginal. In fact, I would say that it is one of my top 5 shows in the past couple of years. My only complainy is that it is not available on Blu-ray. C'mon, ABC, get with the times...

B000SCHC0Q|4.0|The story, though fictional, is a reality in itself.  It tells of the horrors facing Afghan women, the horrors of a country torn by wars - one after the other. It speaks of the effect wars have on Afghan citizens, of families and friends lost and displacement from ones home.<br /><br />My one problem was coming across sections/chapters that seemed too wordy and in my opinion, could have been edited.  There were quite a few pages that I skipped.<br /><br />It was a good read but like I said,very depressing.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|Great game. Good graphic and music not to mention gameplay. I had the force close bug after 31 combos but downloaded the update and it works good now
0156027321|3.0|Be sure to read the Author's Notes as the book is very confusing otherwise. I found Book 1 interesting but in no way comparable to Book 2!
B004T2QZL8|2.0|I have plated similar games before and enjoyed them. That being said DO NOT get this app. after about 30 new combos it will begin force closing after every attempt to combine.<br /><br />Also the lack of repeat combo blocking as I, like one of the people before me, do not have the best memory so that is a serious limitation.<br /><br />Overall if the crash glitches would get fixed it could easily be a 5 star game.
B004MNO0BQ|2.0|I have this app on the iphone, so i purchased it on amazon thinking it was the same version, but it doesn't have 2 player over wifi or bluetooth. Big consumer regret! Please add wifi and i'll update my review.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|First off, I could not put this one down.  The world created in Wool is believable, scary, and real.  I found myself rooting for the good guys and cursing at the bad guys.  Want more!  The fact this was created by an author without big publishing house creds should not put you off.  Be thankful the price of entry is low -- and enjoy.

0439023491|1.0|I read this quickly; what's the fuss about?<br /><br />Okay plot, not very original, two-dimensional characters and a rush to end the story by knocking off the characters very quickly.  It will most likely make a better film than read.<br /><br />This series is fine, I would guess, for younger readers with no attention span.  'Dune' and 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy still set the standard here.
0756407125|1.0|I loved 'Name of the Wind'. A great, and even classic, fantasy novel. But THIS book? Boring to the max. I got SO everlastingly sick and tired of reading about Kvothe having one endless, inane conversation after another with whatever girl he happened to be chasing after at the moment. Where's the action? Where's the drama? Where's the character development? Where's the magic? Where's the PLOT?<br /><br />In this book it is non existent. Save your money. Re-read 'Name of the Wind'. You'll be better entertained and you won't miss much in terms of either plot or character development.
B001UV4XJ2|4.0|This was well done and needs no review. If you've seen the rest you'll want this. If you don't like Potter you won't like this.
B0000041TD|3.0|So many people have praised this as \\"the\\" recording of La Boheme.  I think not.  I listened to this recording years ago - before it ever occurred to me to put a review online - and was disappointed, but I recently listened to it again and decided to stick my finger in the eyes of those who adore it.  First, while I'm not a Pavarotti fan, I have to give credit where it's due; he is the embodiment of youthful ardor, and does a great job.  Second, I am a big Freni fan, and I think she's done another lovely job.  But there the good news ends.  Elizabeth Harwood is just off as Musetta; she sounds, well, old and rough.  Rolando Panerai has some good moments, but it's a very inconsistent performance.  And then there's von Karajan.  His tempos (OK, tempi) and volume are all over the place; sometimes it sounds like it's a chamber piece and sometimes it sounds like a lush and over-orchestrated piece of schmaltz, and sometimes it's slow and sometimes it sounds like von Karajan was late for a bus (or, in his case, a chauffeur-driven Mercedes).  I guess the acid test for me was the second act; La Boheme is a piece of schmaltz, but I still think the brief second act is among the most perfect acts in all opera - and certainly in Italian opera.  In this recording the second act just doesn't work.  Harwood isn't good, von Karajan isn't good.  I'd be inclined to give this recording four stars for Pavarotti and Freni, but I've got to bring it down a peg.<br /><br />One last thought.  I like the Solti/Caballe/Domingo/Milnes/Blegen recording a whole lot ([[ASIN:B000009NIW Puccini: La Boh&egrave;me]]), but I think my desert island recording of Boheme would still be the now ancient one conducted by Sir Thomas Beecham, with Victoria de los Angeles, Jussi Bjoerling and Robert Merrill ([[ASIN:B000063UM0 Puccini: La Boheme (Great Recordings of the Century)]]).  I am not a devotee of old recordings, but that one is a gem.
B0000793ZB|4.0|Recorded at the same time as they did the soundtrack song \\"Don't You Forget About Me\\", \\"Once Upon a Time\\" didn't really reflect the impact of that song but, instead, reflected the musical changes occurring within the band. Although it eschews the glacial feel of their previous albums for a warmer vibe, \\"Once Upon a Time\\" still has quality songs and shows the band searching for a new musical direction while trying to stay as true to their roots as possible.<br /><br />I have mixed feelings about remasters--you never know what you're going to get with the loudness wars, over use of compression and noise reduction that became a hallmark of the late 90's and beyond. While Simon Heyworth's remaster is slightly louder than the original CD and doesn't boast quite the same dynamic range as the original, it also improves on the soundstage (at least compared to the U.S. edition which may have used a different tape source and not the original master tapes), it still sounds pretty good for a modern remaster. Heyworth used much the same techniques that he did with some of the XTC remasters (some of which were very good like [[ASIN:B000T04566 English Settlement]] and some of which were very bad like [[ASIN:B00005ATHO Skylarking]]. In the case of \\"Once Upon a Time\\" and [[ASIN:B0000793ZA Sparkle in the Rain]] Heyworth managed to improve on some of the deficits of the original CD's. That isn't to say this is a perfect remaster--in an ideal world the dynamic range would be kept intact with stronger detail, depth and soundstage as a result. Nevertheless, \\"Once\\" and \\"Sparkle\\" both sound quite good.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there aren't ANY bonus tracks. This would have been an ideal place to add the b-sides, remixes and even \\"(Don't You)Forget About Me\\" since it was recorded around the same time. The artwork is a pathetic reproduction of the original graphics for the album--with lyrics too small to read and even album credits that are in the tiniest fond imaginable. Virgin could have used a bit more imagination when it came to the packaging here and the content.<br /><br />Will you like this remaster? If you want the full dynamic range of the original CD maybe not but if you don't mind some of the loss of that range trading it off for the use of better tapes, detail and soundstage, then this might be the disc for you.used a bit more imagination when it came to the packaging here and the content.<br /><br />Will you like this remaster?

B003L77GRO|4.0|SPOILERS BELOW.<br /><br />Dexter must fry in the electric chair, simply as that (or the gas chamber, don't know what is in Florida).<br /><br />This is the only reasonable ending I can view for this show. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the show a lot. But Dexter is becoming really kind of obnoxious sometimes (other than kis killer-nature, of course).<br /><br />He's beginning to make foul play of current investigations made by their pals at Miami Police, just for the sake of himself killing the guys. It was first stablished that he killed guilty people that got away from justice. A kind of Punisher.<br /><br />But now, he kills the Robocop (Peter Weller) character without any remorse. Ok, the guy was not a very good cop, but was not a killer in any way, and wanted to use Dexter, by denouncing him, to return to his police job. And Dexter killed him mercilessly. And the fact that Quinn had phoned the guy a lot of times just minutes before his death is simply forgotten by his friends. This is the single most annoying point in the whole season.<br /><br />Another atrocious plot line is the LaGuerta/Angel subplot. Soap opera at its worst. As for Debra, I'd like to know how such a \\"charming\\" and \\"polite\\" and \\"adorable\\" girl has guys falling in love for her all the time. But Jennifer is acting very good this season.<br /><br />The Leman character did its part, but it all felt contrived. Ok, the atrocities the guys did with her were uninmaginable, but she went to Dexter mode only to satisfy her rage, and fastly saying to Dexter that she was satisfied and the urge to kill passed. Very, very contrived<br /><br />The only possible way for the show to end (when it ends) is having Dexter caught, tried and executed. Michael C. Hall continues to make wonder with whatever script they throw into his hands, but the Dexter character must not get away with murder indefinitely.

B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I can't see how something this violent and depressing could really be considered a children's book. Scholastic publishing or not, this is a very intense book. The post-apocalyptic commentary on class consciousness and the horrors of war is a moving story, but I honestly don't know whether I could have handled this if I had read it before the age of 16. (If I remember correctly, Scholastic's target audience is ages 7-12, and Harry Potter this isn't.) That said, there is no sex depicted, and the violence isn't as graphically presented as, say, Stephen King's thriller-crime stories or the Mack Bolan books. But Katniss' personal journey from naive to war weary is heart-wrenching and emotionally exhausting.<br /><br />The characterization is better than I've seen since McMaster-Bujold's early Vorkosigan books. If you read fiction to really care about the characters, this book is incredible. The interrelationships between the three leading characters are downright captivating. You follow these characters through their emotional arcs, and by the end of these books their crises are the reader's--and that's about all a reader can ask.<br /><br />So much for my impression as a reader. As an aspiring author myself, I've only got two things to say:<br /><br />1) I wish I had written it, and<br />2) I hope mine are as well-received.<br /><br />Collins has given every writer out there an example of what characterization and emotional development should be. Masterful!

B003Y5H5HO|3.0|I thought the opening credit-imagery was FIRST CLASS and AWARD WINNING<br /><br />The original had a jarring, edgy quality such that when Lisbeth [ SPOILER ALERT ]- in the original -  was first raped orally, you felt the violation. In this new version, the rape scenes are done well; technically superior to the old, but in the original the camera angle from near and behind the man's buttocks as he drags her head onto his front still makes the viewer gag. Rooney is great as she exposes little by little the horror in understanding what he wants, and is totally competent here.<br />It's the DIRECTION THAT FAILS: In the new one,  when a man is trapped burning in a car, Lisbeth is nearby, but the car  just \\"blows up\\"! In the older version, Lisbeth has a chance to save him... and does not, allowing him to watch her watch him burn alive. So, why in this new one - even have the scene of the car exploding into fire? What was the purpose of her standing there? IMHO, Fincher missed the whole point of the scene, or  is he trying to foist a gentler Girl on us? . by making a non-statement? Same thing with the original showing Lisbeth murdering the father. How could a director pass up a scene in which a sexually abused girl drenches her drunken, rapist father in gasoline, he awakens, realizes, stares at her, a 9-year old holding a match, and she tosses it on him. Hello, David Fincher, where are you? and I had trouble following all those \\"Vanger-rlationships.\\" He cud have had the girl put in animating Power-point type creative slides showing the relationships to bring the viewer to understand pretty complex who's who amongst that family.<br />In the original, after Blomvkist and the girl have sex, he appeals to her to stay and sleep with him; \\"I want to be close to you,\\" he tells her, and so Lisbeth faces this reversal of the man sincerely wanting the cuddling and she wanting to remain aloof. Where are you here, Fincher? He just blew these great dramatic situations off, and made a \\"blandular\\" remake. Why? I can only think to build up $team for 2 more sequels, such as are in the Trilogy. If so, I hope he gets some guts into the next one.<br />He had GREAT ACTORS.<br />Craig especially, and Mara. Craig doesn't give in to the temptation to be the tough guy. He plays it perfectly.

1741798981|4.0|The Lonely Planet guide to London is bursting with information. I would advise the reader who wants to make the best use of the book to read it before leaving for London, and make a list of the pages containing information on places that the reader wants to see.<br /><br />The book is filled with color photographs of all kinds of buildings and parks and has long lists of places to eat. There is are also sections on shopping and night life. There is also an entire section on places to stay, called \\"Sleeping.\\"<br /><br />Each tourist attraction is carefully described, with interesting historical anecdotes. There are detailed maps for each section of London at the back of the book, and a pull-out map showing most of the city.<br /><br />The book is so interesting that I am reading it for fun, being an English history buff.<br /><br />The reason I didn't give the book five stars was that the bus and subway maps are two very small panels on the back for the large London pull-out map that are almost impossible to read. Hopefully, that would be remedied in a future edition of the book.

The best Whitney video collection available!

The only people in the village not killed are a couple and an elderly woman who don't share the surnames of the murdered families.  As the police look long and hard for clues, Judge Birgitta Roslin, is shocked to discover one of the murdered couple were foster parents to her mother.<br /><br />She believes the police are looking in the wrong direction but can't seem to make them take the clues she's managed to uncover seriously.<br /><br />Alternately swinging over to the past and traveling from Sweden to China to America, the reader's given the insight into the murders, the murderer and the reasons for them without the whole story becoming clear to the police or Judge Birgitta.
1612130283|4.0|I will admit the book has many weird quirks but overall it is a good read and one of those books you can't put down.  It en-captivates you and you immediately fall in love with Christian Grey even though he is a weirdo. There are a lot of  disturbing parts in the book but there are also a lot of sexy scenes as well.  I only wish that the characters were a bit more original because they do have quite a few Twilight similarities.  All in all, still a new favorite book.  It is very addicting, just like Christian Grey!
1451648537|4.0|I am not sure that anyone from my generation is a proper person to review or really appreciate a biography of Steve Jobs. Mine was the generation where mother made toast in the oven; many a telephone call was made on a phone on which you called \\"Central\\" and were connected; news came either from the newspaper delivered to the door morning and evening or from the Saturday Evening Post or maybe Colliers Magazine, nothing more; and I can't remember anyone who had a radio.<br /><br /> Over the years, of course, that has changed and those of us who are left from the generation to which I refer have become accustomed to most but certainly not all of the gadgets of modern technology. Yes, some can use computers and maybe even a cell phone, but the iPod, the iPhone and the iPad are still in the iCloud for most of us; and those are the instruments that Jobs essentially created and gave to us. If we use them at all we don't use them with the effortless ease, the spontaneity, or the cheerful aplomb of our children, grandchildren and great grandchildren. So I have read this biography with a certain caution, not sure that I have fully appreciated the immense changes the man has brought to our society, not sure, for instance, that I completely understand the significance between an open and closed platform or grasp the elegance of the design of the iPad, and not sure that I can fairly evaluate the man and his work.<br /><br /> One thing I am sure of, however, is that the black nature of the man makes a fair judgment of his work difficult and that, important as he was, there were others too  - mentioned but not honored in the book - who were equally important , equally talented and equally entitled to share the technology stage with him.<br /><br /> This being said, however, I have no problem with appreciating good writing and the exercise of superlative literary and personal judgment on the part the author of this biography, a book which presents an accurate word picture, warts and all, of a major figure, an innovator, a mover and shaker of twenty first century technology, someone who \\"knew what the public wanted before it knew what it wanted\\". Even before he began this project, Walter Isaacson had been a solid biographer of Benjamin Franklin, Henry Kissinger, Albert Einstein and others, working mostly if not completely from secondary sources. Here, however, in his Jobs biography he has worked primarily from original sources. He talked to Jobs - more than forty interviews or conversations. He talked to his former colleagues, his friends and his enemies, the Jobs family near and far, his business associates. In short as a skilled reporter, a former editor of Time and President of CNN he was no lightweight interviewer. Nor, because of his journalistic experience was he any lightweight when it came to putting it all together in an intelligent, readable and accurate story of a man who was his own worst enemy and who has helped define our present by his genius.<br /><br /> Speaking of genius: When the seeds of genius are sprinkled among the human race at birth one hopes that the human vessel which receives them is normal - think Leonardo Da Vinci, J.S. Bach. Wm. Shakespeare, among others - but sometimes the vessel is flawed; and the vessel that was Steve Jobs was flawed beyond any conventional ability to forgive. He was eccentric and narcissistic to the line beyond which lies madness. He was unforgiving, cruel, selfish, unsympathetic, and disloyal to friends and associates. Only to his wife and children, to his adoptive parents and his sister Mona did he exhibit any sign of love or affection. He had no sense of humor, no humility, no gentility and no love for his fellow man or for his life or for that of others. In short, as a person he was simply terrible. And I doubt he ever experienced happiness - even for a moment. Triumph? Maybe. But Solace? Love? Tenderness? Peace? Never! I cannot imagine a sadder life. Yet his genius, his insights, his instincts and his uncontrollable work ethic gave us the best tools - the Mac, the iPod, the iPhone and the iPad - with which to navigate and to find our way in the huge fathomless sea of data and information , the sea of music, art, literature and experience which lies by our bedside and at our doorstep..<br /><br /> So when you read these 600 pages  - and I hope you do - forget the warts on the man, enjoy the story and the way it has been told by a brilliant writer and be aware that this is a once in a lifetime opportunity to read the life story of one of the most brilliant, beguiling, eccentric and important innovators of our time written by one of our very best biographers.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This series is exciting, well written and I could not put down. All ages would enjoy this book and should read.
B0068RHSZO|5.0|During recent years I have seen so many horror movies that had bad, or sad, endings that I hesitated to try Dream House. But its leading actor has pleased me with a number of solid movies, so I took a chance. It is well that I did, and after watching the movie I am perfectly satisfied with it.<br /><br />It is a blend of psychological thriller and horror, and it is done well. It is not a B movie. The lead actor delivers his typically good performance, and the supporting actor and two supporting actresses--all familiar movie faces--also do well. And when everyone acts well, maybe that means the director does well too. The story is pleasantly complicated with some twists and turns, the scripting is plausible, mostly, and the ending is happy.
0143116177|3.0|Ferguson argues that he can follow world history as the history of Finance.  That the direction of nations and empires based on their financial status.<br /><br />Wait... didn't he argue that \\"race\\" was what lead the direction of nations in \\"War of the World\\"?  Didn't he argue that the American Colossus was destined to fail as an empire despite its financial success in \\"Colossus\\"?  (Apparently we are supposed to ignore everything else he's written to follow his thesis).<br /><br />So ignoring the grand thesis of the book, his history of finance is fun and informative.  Stocks, bonds, banking and limited liability companies come off the page as real things that have real histories, rather than arcane mathematical theories of an economics or even most economic history books.<br /><br />Chimerica -<br /><br />Ferguson finishes the work with an important warning.  Those who see the balance of power in the world guaranteed by American debt owed to China and thus tying up the two superpowers in a Financial MAD must remember 1914 and its financial interconnectedness.  Globalization did not avoid World War I; there is no guarantee it will stymie World War III.<br /><br />Overall, I find this book not near as good as Empire or War of the World.  (Probably better than Colossus, which he seemed to just throw out there as a timely follow up to empire).

B001KZI2WW|5.0|The frayed, casual look is just what I wanted, and the positive reviews for comfort swayed me in this direction. Well, the comfort is confirmed. I'd say they run about a 1/2 size small, so account for that when you order. The insole is pebbled with little pips that almost massage your feet as you walk, and they're very well cushioned. I've worn them with jeans, and have worn them casually with shorts, and they perform as advertised. The only decision I have to make now is which color to choose for my second pair.

B007C4ZJ0S|1.0|Yes, I did see the movie, on demand. It was atrociously boring for the first 45 minutes. The lead actress does a good job in her role, but everyone else is expendable and brings nothing to the table.<br /><br />The real issue is that this movie is a terrible rip-off of the exciting, action-packed Angelina Jolie flick \\"Salt.\\" That movie was fast-paced, had a lot going on, and every actor delivered greatly. This movie is the exact opposite. The makers of \\"Haywire\\" should be sued for literally stealing exact scenes, which include the accused woman trying to get out of the main building.<br /><br />Their working on a script to \\"Salt 2\\" right now, just wait for it's release-don't do we I did and watch this garbage to suffice.

B00127RAJY|5.0|This is a great fast and effective workout. I have used this video twice post-partum as well as for big vacations. I definitely notice results quickly--by day 5 I can always see a difference in my muscle definition. I find Jillian to be very annoying but also motivating--kind of a love/hate relationship with her. I definitely recommend making sure you are drinking a ton of water throughout the day while on the shred, and also taking a multivitamin--it seems to help with the calf soreness that many reviewers complain of.<br /><br />Also, I have seen a number of reviewers who complain of knee problems as a result of the shred. Prior to ever doing the shred I had bad knees--I had a total reconstructive surgery on one and the have been putting off an arthroscopy on the other. Despite this, I have never had any knee problems related to this DVD. In fact, I find that strengthening my leg and knee muscles usually alleviates some of my typical knee discomfort. I think good form is definitely important, and I also ice my knees after the workout if I have any knee discomfort. (Which I have only ever experienced the first couple days.)
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|Rick and the other survivors in zombie land get shelter at a farm, after his son Carl is shot by a hunter on accident. Which makes season 2 a little slower with more talk and arguing at the farm through most of the season.<br />  However, the season has plenty of action, zombies and a scene full of tension when Rick meets two new survivors at a bar who also want shelter at the farm and don't want no for an answer. You also nave Shane getting more delusional to the idea of him, Lori and Carl living happily ever after if Rick was dead. While most of the season, Daryl is looking for Sophia, a little girl in the group who went missing during an early zombie attack in the season.<br />  Some fans complained that you just have the survivors at the farm bickering through most of the season and there's hardly any zombies. But that makes me wonder, what show were they watching ?? lol. There's still plenty of zombie attacks and if you want to see tons and tons of zombies at once, be patient, the season finale certainly has that! The season, though is mostly about the survivors struggling to keep their humanity, especially Rick and Shane \\"who really isn't trying too hard.\\"

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved the story plot and how the action plays out in the first book, its not hard for me to see this actually happening someday with how our government feels the need to control everything. However I struggle to see this for young adults. I am 22 so I am a young adult but I picture this book being marketed for like 12-16 year olds. While I am sure that they can read the material but the maturity level that is needed to understand the aspect of the hunger games or why someone would want to do this. There is no sex in the book but it is violent and a very adult topic. Overall I loved the book and hope that the movie can stand up to the levels it has set up.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|After reading the first two books I was way past being sucked into this story line. But after reading a lot of the reviews I was skeptical on how it was going to be ending up. But after reading it through I am even more in love with the trilogy itself. Everyone was expecting a happily ever after ending in which everyone gets to live and they are all friends again. But than again it is a war/fighting trilogy and while there is somewhat of a love/happily-ever-after ending its not what anyone would expect. Overall I love the books and the idea behind the Hunger Games. Definitly will be reading these books again!

B000FC1AGG|3.0|I have never read one of Sophie Kinsella's books before. I actually own \\"Confessions of a Shopaholic\\" and I've seen the movie, but I just haven't mustered up the courage to pick it up. So I decided that I'd go ahead and try out Sophie Kinsella and see if I liked her. I did like it. I knew from the word go how things would turn out, but it was still a pretty amusing and well put together story. It's hard for me to describe this book, I mean this author is so well-known most people have an opinion already.<br /><br />So the basics, the story is amusing, there are some internal chuckle moments, but nothing laugh out loud worthy. There is some romance and heartbreak, and some ladies you just want to slap. This is most definitely \\"chick lit\\" and is great for a generic audience. Also this is a very fast read, it's not a short book, but it reads quickly. It's not one I'd pick up again and it's almost forgettable, but I am interested to finally read my copy of Shopaholic.

0061743526|5.0|I know more than one person who considers To Kill a Mockingbird their favorite book. My friend Bob cherishes his first edition and speaks glowingly of the time when the author signed his copy. Ms. Lee, who grew up in Monroeville, Alabama, was a young child during the famous Scottsboro, Alabama Case (nine black men were accused of raping two white women). This apparently had a significant influence on her as she wrote the book in the late 1950's. It was published at the beginning of the Civil Rights Movement, won the Pulitzer Prize in 1961, and two years later was made into an Academy Award winning film with Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch.<br /><br />It's an endearing story told through the eyes of a nine year old girl, Scout, and it meant several things to me:<br /><br />It affirms that goodness ultimately overcomes evil, but always at a cost.<br />It condemns racial prejudices--as well as the fear and prejudices directed toward the Boo Radley's of the world (who in the end becomes the protector and a symbol of goodness).<br />Innocents can and do suffer from man's stupidity, e.g. Tom Robinson. The title is really about innocence, as Miss Maudie explains: \\" Mockingbird's don't do one thing but sing their hearts out for us. That's why it's a sin to kill a mockingbird.\\"<br />It reinforced a personal belief--that people are not basically good--a worldview leading to the assumption that everything bad a person does, is society's fault. I believe that people are born innocent and we grow up absorbing, learning, and understanding that good and evil are a part of us, if we ever grow up to maturity, that is. What Atticus Finch teaches his children is to understand that evil is a part of the world and we should treat people with empathy, as though we were \\"walking in their shoes.\\" His understanding and treatment of crass old Mrs. Dubose was a lesson in patient understanding--her life was mixed with great courage yet she was openly racist, which Atticus abhorred.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|If you like sci-fi, you cannot overlook this series. Hugh Howey creates a tangible, dystopian future with economy and clarity. His characters are attainable, developed and the storyline sucks you in and keeps you there even as it changes. I tore through these fast and will be reading more from Mr Howey.<br /><br />For reference, I usually read hard sf/space opera-types (Reynolds, Hamilton, Macleod) but am also keen for Herbert, Asimov, Heinlein, Dick and recently Cronin. I have never left a book review, but was compelled to do so by Wool.

B006L4MWVE|5.0|When the latest YA fad of The Hunger Games came strolling through the culture, more than one nerd read a plot summary, and, forehead creased, muttered, \\"What is this--Battle Royale?\\"<br /><br />And, with a dramatic, acne-riddled flourish, the great barbarian hordes of the nerd kingdom raised their fists, babbling incoherant, adulterated Japanese.  Events like Comic Con and Dragon Con trembled with their tender, awkward rage.<br /><br />I was at the frontlines of that unified moment of nerd rage, and I am happy to see this re-release of Battle Royale, even if it is clearly to try another dollar from the Young Adult section of the literary bankroll.<br /><br />For the fledgling among you, Battle Royale is just a terrific watch.  Your cultural barometer doesn't have to go anywhere east for you to recognize this as a tense, horrifying thriller.  Beyond that, it does a great job of expressing the awkward, emotional strain of 9th graders, faced suddenly with certain death.  Their decisions--who to kiss, who to kill--shape them in our eyes.<br /><br />Of course, the stand out performance here is that of Takeshi Kitano.  His twitchy, bizarre delivery haunts you, but also leaves room for sympathy, which is no small feat.  Sympathizing with a man who murders children is tough, even for those of us who have uncles just like that.<br /><br />For return viewers, my recommendation is to purchase this edition.  Largely, for the translation.  While decent in earlier editions, by the end of the film (particularly the final three requiems), the translation becomes unbearably indecipherable.  This edition redelivers those lines poignantly and perfectly.<br /><br />So it's worth the money, nerds.  Slap that cash down.
B0033AI4CK|5.0|I must admit that I hadn't heard of this movie until 2011 (I was only 4 when it came out and it never played in my home country). I picked it up last year 2011 through Netflix and immediately fell in love with its prophetic and satirical power. This movie is even more relevant today than it was back in 1976.<br /><br />It brilliantly shows the hypocrisies of our time, mostly how profits and financial gain have become the only measure of things and how quickly values can shift as a result of this measure, how it deteriorates relationships between people, friends, lovers, employers-employees.<br /><br />First, the network wants to shut off Howard Beale, the anchorman who is angry over being fired for low ratings but when Beale goes on ranting on live TV and ratings go up, they immediately devise a plan to make profit out of it. Something considered obscene yesterday can be considered a corporate strategy today. I'd like to quote two of my favorite monologues from the movie (I think they sum up best what the movie is trying to say):<br /><br />This is the scene when Mr Beale goes to meet the president Arthur Jensen, and here's what Arthur Jensen has to say:<br />\\"You are an old man who thinks in terms of nations and peoples. There are no nations!, there are no peoples! There are no Russians! There are no Arabs! There are no Third Worlds! There is no West! There is only one holistic system of systems. One vast and immane...interwoven, interacting, multi-variate, multinational of dollars. Petrol dollars, electro-dollars, multi-dollars. Reichsmarks, rins, rubles, pounds and shekels. It is the international system of currency which determines the totality of life on this planet. That is the natural order of things today. There is no America! There is no democracy! There is only IBM and ITT and AT&T..and DuPont, Dow, Union Carbide, and Exxon. Those are the nations of today.\\"<br /><br />After this encounter, that evening Mr. Beale goes on TV to preach the corporate cosmology of Arthur Jensen:<br />\\"....we know that democracy is a dying giant...a sick, sick, dying, decaying, political concept writhing in its final pain. I don't mean that the United States is finished as a world power. The United States is the richest and most powerful, the  most advanced country, light years ahead of any country. And I don't mean the communists are gonna take over the world because the communists are deader than we are. What is finished...is the idea that this great country is dedicated to the freedom and flourishing of every individual in it. It's the individual that's finished. This is no longer a nation of independent individuals. It's a nation of some 200-odd million transistorized, deodorized, whiter than white steel-belted bodies...totally unnecessary as human beings and as replaceable as piston rods. Is \\"dehumanization\\" such a bad word? The whole world is becoming humanoid...creatures that look human but aren't. The whole world not just us. We are the most advanced country so we are getting there first. The whole world's people are becoming mass-produced, programmed, numbered insensate things\\".<br /><br />Blu ray is OK, not great but it's not terrible. Overall it's a little grainy, most likely, due to the nature of the film used. But still looks pretty good given the fact that it is 36 years old. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in social and economical issues of today. There aren't many movies that are as clever as Network.of Arthur Jensen:<br />\\"....we know that democracy is a dying giant...a sick, sick, dying, decaying, political concept writhing in its final pain.

B0043XDV8I|4.0|Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe have now done four movies together, the most notable of which is undoubtedly Gladiator, a fantastic story, and a brilliantly realised movie in the tradition of Braveheart.<br /><br />With Robin Hood director and actor would face a story and a character, portrayed many times in movies and tv series. Robin Hood has been played by actors as diverse as Sean Connery, Kevin Costner, Patrick Bergin and Errol Flynn. Even Mel Brooks did a series Robin Hood Men in tights.<br /><br />Inevitably, if you are like me, you will make comparisons with your other experiences of Robin Hood. Bravely, it attempts to tell the story in a fresh and invigorating way, exploring the story before the story you already know.<br /><br />Firstly, in this story Robin Hood is not yet Robin Hood, but Robin Longstride, a man of uncertain origin and we suspect less than noble birth, and we meet him on the battlefields of France, fighting the cause of King Richard. Robin calls out the King's reckless crusade, and Robin and his three friends end up in the stocks, and so the adventure begins.<br /><br />Eventually, Robin and his men escape, and Robin assumes the identity of a dying nobleman, and agrees to carry out his last wish, which leads him to Lady Marion.<br /><br />Usually King Richard plays as a heroic character still abroad, and Prince John remains a scheming prince. Here however John becomes the King, and undergoes somewhat of an unlikely transformation from weakling mamas boy Prince to tyrant King.<br /><br />This presents a dilemma in accepting the story as given. Sometimes while watching this movie, particuarly action scenes you may feel like you are watching Braveheart or Gladiator.<br /><br />Apparently, Russell Crowe walked out of a BBC radio interview, when the British presenter, suggested his accent was Irish not English, Russell responding bollocks, and telling 'you got dead ears, mate.' You got to love Russell.<br /><br />Being Irish myself, I did think there was one scene where he had a slight lilt, other than that I found nothing wrong with the accent. In any event, I don't think Sean Connery has ever done anything other than a Scottish accent, even when he won the Academy Award playing an Irish policeman with a Scottish accent.<br /><br />I think most people will enjoy it. If the story elements had been more consistent with other versions I definitely would have enjoyed it more.<br /><br />What I liked most about this movie was him releasing the arrow in slow motion with drops of water flying off, and I also like the Little John character, who you may recognise as a villain from Lost.<br /><br />I hope you found this review helpful.there was one scene where he had a slight lilt, other than that I found nothing wrong with the accent.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|These books were amazing!  I am a fan of the Harry Potter series and Twilight, but these books went above and beyond all expectations I had! I could not put them down! The fact that they were all packed together in a trilogy was very convenient and I much preferred having them all together for easy reading on my Kindle.
B004LWZW4W|5.0|11 may go down as the year of remakes, reboots, and sequels. We had Footloose, The Thing, Straw Dogs, the end of the Harry Potter series. We had great prequels such as Xmen First Class, the best of the series, and now we have Rise of the Planet of the Apes.<br /><br />I have not seen all the Planet of the Apes series, but I have seen the first one with Charlton Heston, and the fish out of water, topsy turvy, apes rule the planet is hard to emulate and surpass from a storytelling point of view, as is the mythology of the original story, with the enlighened apes having their own spin on the evolution of the planet.<br /><br />With Rise of the Planet of the Apes we have the beginning of the mythology, and shifting the iconography west from the Statue of you know what to the Golden Gate Bridge and San Francisco. Every behavior has a positive intention, such as finding a cure for cancer or alzheimers, and making money in the process, yet at the same time exploiting innocent creatures to do so. When these elements get out of control then behaviors can have unintended consequences.<br /><br />For me, the mythology of the birth of Caesar under unusual circumstance, to a mother dosed with performance enhancing drugs parallels the birth of Moses, who would grow up to lead his people out of Egypt (San Francisco) to the promised land (Muir Woods). Human hubris, leads to the fall of humanity and the rise of the Planet of the Apes.<br /><br />Following the purging of the 12, Caesar as a baby, is found not in the rushes but in a cage, and secretly raised by a scientist James Di Franco, and his girlfriend played by Freida Pinto. We know that he has extraordinary abilities, that must be kept under wraps. Nevertheless Caesar has to contend with his own instinctive nature, and acting with the intention to protect gets into serious trouble. Caesar has observing ego, and learns from his mistakes. When we see a recurrence of a similar situation he handles it differently.<br /><br />Living in San Francisco I loved how these scenes played out in familiar locales, such as downtown San Francisco, and Muir Woods with the 150 foot high redwoods, which Caesar climbs, the panoramic views, and I particularly loved the confrontation scenes on the Golden Gate bridge, and how the fog was able to help with battle. I don't normally recommend special effect, except to say that they are outstanding.<br /><br />Andy Serkis, who previously played King Kong, plays Caesar, and movie magic from WETA captures the almost human facial expressions, and makes us empathise with his situation, we can see his thought processes. I loved the prison scenes, and how Caesar rises to become leader, how he contends with the alpha male, his captors, how he organises his fellow inmates. Evolution becomes revolution.<br /><br />Although the original with Charlton Heston is hard to beat, I loved this version. When a franchise runs out of steam, and a story runs out of possibilities, it is perhaps time to go back before the beginning, and start anew, and free of the restrictions of the original story, come up with something fresh and emotionally engaging. They did it with Batman Begins. That franchise was bereft of life.<br /><br />Now it has been done with Planet of the Apes. I would be interested in seeing a sequel, where Caesar perhaps has a love interest, she gets captured, they have a kid, and there is a power struggle within the apes, betrayal, escalation with the humans. The possibilities are endless.<br /><br />I think most people will enjoy this, and I hope you found this helpful.g in San Francisco I loved how these scenes played out in familiar locales, such as downtown San Francisco, and Muir Woods with the 150 foot high redwoods, which Caesar climbs, the panoramic views, and I particularly loved the confrontation scenes on the Golden Gate bridge, and how the fog was able to help with battle.

B006OFN0BQ|4.0|Throughout an illustrious directing career Clint Eastwood has delivered outstanding movies such as Unforgiven, Mystic River, and Million Dollar Baby, for which he has won five Academy Awards, for best Picture, Best Director, and including the Irving Thalberg Life Achievement Award. My personal favorite of all his directed movies is Gran Torino.<br /><br />The actors who have worked with him have been blessed with Oscar: Gene Hackman for Unforgiven, Tim Robbins and Sean Penn for Mystic River, Morgan Freeman and Hilary Swank for Million Dollar Baby.<br /><br />When I heard Clint Eastwood was doing a movie about Hoover, I admit I was somewhat excited, although it would be a challenging movie to do.<br /><br />I wondered would it deal with the relationship with the Kennedys, conspiracy theories, Hoover's alleged homosexuality, and alleged crossdressing, if it would deal with the entire career, if it would dare to show him in all his unpleasantness and darkness.<br /><br />If Hoover were alive today, I think he would be horrified at this movie. Undoubtedly, no such movie could have been made while he was alive.<br /><br />J Edgar deals with the entire span of J Edgar's career and makes brave choices in portraying the relationship between he and his No 2, Colson. The screenplay was written by same person who wrote the screen play for Milk.<br /><br />Leonardo DiCaprio making his first movie apart from Martin Scorsese in 12 years does an outstanding job in the title role, as does Arnie Hammer in the role of Colson. Naomi Watts plays Hoover's long time secretary to whom he proposes early in the movie, and Judi Dench plays his domineering and controlling mother.<br /><br />We see certain conflicts, and Hoover's use of Machivellian tactics in pursuing communists, upholding his position as head of the FBI through investigating the high ranking politicians who proved a threat. Whatever one thinks about Hoover one has to acknowledge some brilliance particuarly in organising, popularising the use of fingerprinting evidence, organising a national criminal database leveraging the Lindbergh tragedy to increase his own powers, and creating a highly respected investigative organisation.<br /><br />It was interesting to see how he was able to use propaganda to boost the reputation of the FBI. At one time the gangsters seemed to hold sway in the public consciousness as heroes, until the FBI's machine gun toting G men replaced them. We also see Hoover's vanity and narcissism in full display, and his racism particularly towards Martin Luther King.<br /><br />The Hoover story unfolds with Hover dictating his memoirs to a succession of agents. Why would he not use his secretary for this? It seems he wishes to tell his story to these people for vanity, and to promote himself as a legendary icon.<br /><br />In reality, Hoover was a temple of secrets, and probably the least likely person you could imagine would write his own memoirs. Although, he secretly tape recorded JFK, and MLK for exmaple, his relationship with Colson could possibly have ended his career if the true nature of the relationship became public. It's well known for example that Hoover did not allow women agents, nor did he hire African Americans. Yet, we have him dictating his memoirs at one point to an African American agent.<br /><br />One of the challenges with the story was the lack of a continuous protagonist, he mostly does battle with entities rather than individuals, such as communism and organised crime. By the 1960s apparently, he got soft on organised crime, while Bobby Kennedy got hard. Yet we have only two scenes in the movie with Bobby Kennedy.<br /><br />Another difficulty is the excessive use of makeup on several of the actors. With DiCaprio it's fine, but with Naomi Watts, and Arnie Hammer they wear bloodshot contact lenses which was over the top and unnecessary, and distracting. Old people do not necessarily have bloodshot eyes.<br /><br />I thought the performances byboth DiCaprio and Hammer were deserving of Oscar recognition, though neither were nominated.<br /><br />While Clint Eastwood has probably brought me more enertainment than anyone as both an actor and director, I am not as staunch a supporter of this movie as the others in recent years such as Changeling, Gran Torino, and Invictus. Nevertheless I give it 4 stars because I think it was a very challenging movie to do well.<br /><br />I hope this was helpful.both DiCaprio and Hammer were deserving of Oscar recognition, though neither were nominated.<br /><br />While Clint Eastwood has probably brought me more enertainment than anyone as both an actor and director, I am not as staunch a supporter of this movie as the others in recent years such as Changeling, Gran Torino, and Invictus.

B005LZW8FO|5.0|Watching Lars Von Trier's Melancholia, about an approaching planet led me to this movie made around the same time.<br /><br />As Another Earth begins, we are introduced to a bright, attractive young girl with a brilliant future, with an interest in the Cosmos, and she has just got into MIT.<br /><br />When another earth with the same continents and oceans appears in the sky, people get excited, some are nervous. As she drives along that night, a radio announcer talks excitedly about the new planet, while a father, pregnant mother, and five year old child sit talking in a parked car. Momentarily, she looks skyward. You can probably imagine what happens.<br /><br />Now we have a woman whose life is but a walking shadow. After some time she returns to the world. But her star has somewhat diminished. Although she says little me may infer that she has unresolved grief and guilt which cripples her from moving forward in life. She takes a job that requires little human contact, as a cleaner.<br /><br />Returning to the scene, she discovers the husband, and contrives to meet him and seek forgiveness.<br /><br />Discoveries about the other earth may make you wonder if there are people like you on this other earth, mirrors to ourselves, mirroring our events or not. Such possibilities offer the hope of redemption, although others find it frightening.<br /><br />As the husband continues to contend with his waterlogged grief, his withdrawal, and limitations of his previous musical abilities, we see no way for her to broach this subject. Meanwhile, a Branson like entrepeneur offers a select few a free trip to the other earth.<br /><br />My favorite scene in the movie is when she tells the husband the story of the first cosmonaut, a healing metaphor, and so perhaps if she cannot reveal herself she may be able to heal him in other ways. I watched this scene over and over. We wonder how it will all turn out.<br /><br />I found this movie to be very beautiful. It has won several awards, including two Sundance Awards, the Special Jury Prize, and an acting award for Brit Marling, a young actress who struggled to obtain acting jobs in Hollywood, and had the novel idea of writing a movie for herself with cowriter and director Michael Hall.<br /><br />In doing so, they have crafted a wonderful movie. As an actress she delivers a very subtle and nuanced performance. In three scenes in a row near the begininning she says very little, but she conveys a tremendous amount without words, and she has a certain beauty, let's face it, that, if you're like me, grows on you as you watch the movie. Another earth looks like an expensive movie, yet was made on a shoestring, causing director and actress to be very resourceful. To obtain a shot of her walking out of a prison, she walked in pretending to be a yoga instructor, there to give a class to inmates. When she walked out he got the shot.<br /><br />I was hugely impressed with this movie, the acting, writing, directing, the visual effects of the other planet. William Mapother, who you may remember as Ethan from Lost, or the villain from In the Bedroom plays the husband. Certainly, I liked this movie much better than Melancholia.<br /><br />Now, I would watch any movie featuring Brit Marling or made by Michael Hall. I think you will love it, and I hope this was helpful.ds, including two Sundance Awards, the Special Jury Prize, and an acting award for Brit Marling, a young actress who struggled to obtain acting jobs in Hollywood, and had the novel idea of writing a movie for herself with cowriter and director Michael Hall.<br /><br />In doing so, they have crafted a wonderful movie.

0439023513|2.0|The book deserves a 2.4/5, so I rounded down. I really liked the first 2 books, but this one left me feeling disappointed at first. Now after I've had time to think, I feel mostly manipulated. While all books manipulate you, the best ones don't make it obvious like this one. One of my biggest gripes is that Gale never served any purpose in the series besides being part of a love triangle. Some people claim this series is better than Twilight, but that series handled the love problem much better than HG. Also, I just didn't like Katniss in this one. She never appeared strong, assured, or even decisive. Few, if any, of the people acted realistically.<br /><br />The author wants to portray the horrors of war, but does it in the most contrived manner to elicit a response from the reader. Things happen and people react in ways that don't make sense. We don't even know if the government has gone through any true change. The people change in ways that don't make sense, as everyone around Katniss who doesn't die pretty much abandon her in other ways. It all seems calculated to make us feel sad about war, but really it's just the author manipulating us. And many of us don't like it.<br /><br />***spoilers*****spoilers****spoilers****<br /><br />Prim's death was created only to manipulate the audience. It served almost no purpose other than to show you can't trust Coin, but there were other and better ways to show that. Next, everyone abandons Katniss at the end when she's at her lowest. Neither Gale, nor her mother can even bother to visit her for no valid reason. If I only had 1 family member left who had been through severe trauma, I would not leave her alone. Finnick's death was also pointless. He should never have been in the military in the first place. He had his loved one safe, he was married, and he easily could've been used as a symbol of the hope a new world can come with a new gov't. His death was to manipulate the audience.<br /><br />Katniss's strength was undermined in this book. Not just because she spends all her time wondering if she should help the rebels in the beginning, but at the end when she loses herself. People who come home from war unable to function in life are rare. People die all the time; loved ones die every day. The fact that Katniss cannot deal with Prim's death, nor could Katniss's mother, shows incredible mental instability below the average person. We've never dealt with the hardship described in Hunger Games which tends to make people immune to loss, but we all manage to continue to live life despite the death of friends and family. We make more, we move on. This is hinted at in the end, but it's overshadowed and almost lost. Just do your family history before the 1900s, little children died every day from accidents, weather, or lack of medicine. People who are used to it, while they aren't immune, don't break down worse than people today.<br /><br />Other reviews have described it better than I have, but this book leaves you almost empty. Yes, war is hell. But there's always hope and there are people ready to do the noble and selfless thing that needs to be done. Katniss was never selfless, everything she did was for her own benefit. Maybe it appeared selfless because she was willing to die, but it was always because she didn't want to suffer with the guilt of letting her loved ones die or losing her loved ones. She didn't have to be perfect, but she should have been stronger at the end.<br /><br />Some think the ending was brave because it reflected reality better than many stories. Yet, we are left without any knowledge about what is going on. We are just assuming the new gov't is perfect and treats everyone fairly and that's it, despite the distrust built up against all gov't people throughout the entire book. It undermines itself. This book leaves you feeling hollow and somewhat empty inside, with a tiny glimmer of hope.

B006OKOZGU|5.0|Please describe (accurately) the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.  Thanks to those who do this.<br /><br />This has to be about the best video quality I've ever seen on a Blu-Ray.  It is better than 99% of the Blu-Ray movies I have seen.  I give it a 9.9 on a 10.0 scale.  It is better than most modern day movies which are shot digitally.  I usually have something negative to say about the video quality on a Blu-Ray, but I can't think of any critisisms, except maybe a little softness in some of the scenes.  I didn't see any grain in the entire movie, and I sit about 7 feet away from a 52\\" LCD.  You know you have great video quality when you can pause the movie, and still see no grain.  Even the dark scenes were without grain.  Blacks were blacks, with no video distortion.  I paused the movie and stood a foot away, and saw only very slight grain in the blue sky, and the fine grain wasn't widespread.<br /><br />The image was very sharp and detailed, except for some close up skin shots.  The reason I say this video is better than most modern day movies shot digitally, is because even the background seems to be sharp and focused.  The background in most modern movies is usually blurred, very soft, and out of focus.  Colors were fantastic.<br /><br />All Blu-Ray movies should look this good.  Most older movies have some grain.  Some modern movies have grain and look terrible.  This video is fantastic.<br /><br />Aspect ratio is about 1.85:1 (filled my widescreen), not the 2.35:1 listed in the product description.<br /><br />Where they did skimp is with the soundtrack. I selected Dolby TrueHD 2.0, which was the best sound I could select, but most of the sound seemed to come from the center.  In fact, my modern 7.1 receiver couldn't even play the TrueHD soundtrack, so I wonder if this disc even has it.  Although my receiver didn't display TrueHD, when I pressed the \\"Display\\" button on the remote, it displayed \\"Dolby TrueHD 2/0\\" no my TV - so I am confused. If the soundtrack really is stereo, I couldn't hear much channel separation.  But, the sound was adequate.<br /><br />I have to give this Blu-Ray 5 stars because of the excellent video quality.  The movie lasted an hour and 46.5 minutes.  I was disappointed there were no credits at the end.If the soundtrack really is stereo, I couldn't hear much channel separation.

B006OB3K56|5.0|Difficult to watch and impossible to forget. It hurts to watch Fassbender's performance of a desperately lonely addict, but at the same time I couldn't take my eyes off him.
B00632HWOG|3.0|As a Yahoo mail user, I prefer using the Yahoo mail app over the default mail app installed on the Kindle Fire.  It syncs up better with my Yahoo Mail account, and feels easier to navigate.  The big problem is that the app is constantly freezing up on my Kindle.  I can't use it without having it freeze or crash completely.  It's also very slow to load the emails.  I'm not sure if it's the app or the Kindle Fire, but either way it's annoying.  Overall, I like it better than the default mail app on the Fire, but the freezing issue is a major problem.
B004KBSQBA|5.0|simon is a musical genius<br />There are few if any musical people out there like him today.I might buy more of his genre before I die.
B00325NM6E|5.0|This is for the hardcover edition of Absolute Watchmen.<br /><br />If you've read the story, you know what it's about. If you've never read it... what are you waiting for, an invitation?<br /><br />To business. The Absolute format reprints comic books (yes, COMICS; they're not \\"graphic novels\\") at a noticeably larger size and, in cases like Watchmen, restored color. In relation to that, Absolute Watchmen looks AMAZING! The size, the color, the high quality paper, it's definitely flawless in terms of presentation.<br /><br />As far as extras, you get sketches, snippets of Moore's pitch, subsequent revisions and even a sample of his heavily detailed scripts. There are also essays from Moore and Gibbons written not long after Watchmen was completed.<br /><br />The binding is strong and sturdy enough to last for years. The book is heavy enough to lay flat and open to whichever page you want without need for a paper weight. The book also includes a ribbon bookmark.<br /><br />Nothing, NOTHING, about this edition was done on the cheap. DC spared no expense. They seriously knocked themselves out to make this the best possible presentation, and it shows.<br /><br />Skip those ridiculous prequels and stick with the original. You'll be glad you did.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was unfamiliar with the Hunger Game series until the early promos for the film came out. When I read this book I was hooked. Hunger Games was a fun and easy read but hugely entertaining....I didn't want to put it down. I have finished reading the trilogy and loved all of the books. If you want entertainment, no smut, no f bombs and just a great, easy, yet intriguing read, pick it up. You'll be hooked.
B005LHOKFS|5.0|I already have the NYC (New York City, New York) and ORL (Orlando, Florida) apps so this was a great addition! I was able to write reviews and on a Kindle Fire this is easier to navigate than a website. I &lt;3 this app!!!!
B0042JTDXK|4.0|I have every CD that Josh Groban has put out. He has a beautiful and very soothing voice, for young and old. I was a little disappointed in this CD. I was not as pleased with the song selection. But to each his own. He still is a very talented singer and will continue to be so. Hope he selects different songs the next time.  I will still buy the CD.
B004SRNH10|3.0|I don't remember downloading this app. I don't know if I've ever used it. The app, however, has not caused any problems on my phone.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|I picked this book off of a list for a History class I'm taking as a freshman in college, although it was one of the longest ones on the list, I'm very pleased with my decision. This book is a page turner, I can't put it down. It has so many twist and turns that you don't see coming. In my opinion it is defiantly a book one should read, for enjoyment or just for the history. I love it, and I'm hoping they make it into a movie :-)
B004ZQBOK0|5.0|This band has got hate for nothing. This album is totally different from their debut album We Stitch These Wounds. It has the awesome drumms from CC , Catchy Riffs from Jake and Jixx and solos,Better vocals from andy and they are very unique also and great bass by ashley purdy. The songwriting has improved so much and i see bright things in the future for them
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I use this app on my kindle fire and its great for waking up in the morning so if you don't like it you have another thing coming

B000SEFNMS|5.0|Great read.  Krakauer is an excellent writer.  I've enjoyed many of his works such as the Pat Tillman book he wrote, but this one is right near the top.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to all.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|amazing is just one of the few ways to describe this brand new rovio game but seriously make it app of the day or at least make it free for some of us who aren't allowed to waste money on games on kindle fire of ipod this game looks really awesome just needs to be free
1451627289|4.0|As I first time Stephen King reader I was far from disappointed with this book. It was well researched and well written. The one problem I saw in it was that of excessive explicit language. The book begins in 2011 and the language was appropriate for the time but as Jake travels back to the 1960's, easing up on the swearing would have added to the stories dialect. At a time when nearly everything we think of today as \\"normal\\" was very controversial I didn't find it very convincing to have young woman repeatedly using foul language in day to day life and in public. Aside from that this book is wonderful, a real page-turner. While many time travel books seem to be a scar on even the greatest authors career this one was certainly a win.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|This was a really great little app until I downloaded the new update and now the animated maps not only do not work but shuts the app down. Fix the bug and I will change the rating.
B005ER6SNM|5.0|It is a movie that is hard to look away from and you know it will leave you messed up while watching it but you have to finish it. It's that bad and that good at the same time. I was sorry that I read a review before watching it that gave away the ending so I would say if you want to see a traumatizing film that leaves you thinking why I watched it, this is a good one for you. I did enjoy the film and the acting was very well done. It is just hard to get it out of your head after. I like to be shocked while watching a movie and see something artistically done that I have never seen on film before. This one ranks up there in my wild movie picks.
140053271X|2.0|Mine worked for about a month, then froze completely. When it was working it was amazing! It took me a long time to want to switch to digital reading, but after a week of using it I was converted completely. The only problem was that the one I got was defective.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I'm having a blast with this game. The only problem is it's so addictive, I'm having trouble getting other things done!
