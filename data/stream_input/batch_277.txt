B00006690G|3.0|Dont listen to the other people sayin this is a bad album...its not a bad album but its not a great album either. Yea his rhymes are good but his singing isnt (Halies Song) I think his other cds were much better than this one. Songs like \\"Drips\\" and \\"Halies Song\\" and \\"Superman\\" make this cd sound bad. \\"Superman\\" and \\"Halies Song\\" sound like they were only made to impress female fans. He may be the hottest selling artist at the moment and deserves to be with Loose Yourself but not with this album. If you want true eminem style pick up his first two cds they were very good.
0812550706|5.0|This book by Orson Scott Card is a must read for any sci-fi fan. This is a fine example of a book that never stops to entertain you. Never has a stray thought that could bore you from the main story. A great book for anyone! Can't put it down!
B000062TU1|4.0|Wow, I loved this movie.  It was funny and entertaining.  Ron was funny and well casted.  He was perfect for the role and made the movie a lot better.  Hermione was also perfectally casted.  Malfoy too.  The malice was so....there.  The movie had great action, funny moments and some sad scenes.  Harry Potter, a movie for all ages from 10-100!  I recomend this movie to anyone who liked the book and to people who didn't.

B0000549B2|4.0|Ok Denzel is in it playing a bit of a cad.  But the real news here is that this is one of Spike's better movies, unlike the forgetable Girl 6 or Bamboozled, both nice efforts but far off the mark.  Wesley Snipes, who to me is always better when he plays an evil character, is wonderful in this.  Denzel is a little on the flat side in this one, this isn't a Malcolm X or Training Day performance for him.  Wesley is wonderful.  No action hero [stuff], just a great acting job.  Spike is in it as expected and does his usual in his role.  Joi Lee is credable and the soundtrack is good if not spectacular.  If you are a Spike or a Wesley fan, add it to your collection.  If not rent it and give it a look, its worth the price of a rental for sure.
B00005RFQ5|5.0|wow! princes new cd is really amazing, I have been listening to it for a while now, sure it has religious overtones but gospel type music can be pretty amazing wether you are religious or not..<br />I was pretty disappointed with his cd a few years ago Rave Unto the year 2000 so I haven't listened to any of his other new cd's much. but this one was really easy for me to get into, and he actually plays some smoking guitar on a few tracks...If you like prince you will like this I gar-Un-Tee
0743455967|5.0|Who says Stephen King can't write memoirs too? This infact might be one of the best memoirs I have ever read. The stories he shares with the reader, will crack you up, but the best thing is that in the back of the book, there is a list of Stephen King's reccomendations, well immediately after reading this book, I went out and got some of his reccommendations and they were all great reads. King also has some helpers for aspiring writers, he also told how he became the biggest writer in the world, shame that this great man is retiring from writing, I will miss the way he wrote with such humor and horror.
B000069AUI|5.0|'Parachutes' marked the entry of Coldplay as a Big Rock Act , giving us tunes which were fresh , vibrant , soft and lyrically and vocally blessed.<br />'A Rush of Blood to the head ' proves the band is evolving and moving in the right direction , where the music remains from the album , but the audience grows. The album is one step ahead than its preceeder and highlights the bands creativity in song crafting.<br />Alike , 'parachutes' this album has many wonderful tracks and in my opinion every track is worth the listen. The acoustic , piano and guitar riffs on each track vary to the extremes making way for an album which just can not be related to any other album or music sound. Songs such as &quot; Politik&quot; , &quot; God put a smile upon your face&quot; , &quot; In my place&quot; protray the engery level of the band rising to another level. While , &quot; Clocks &quot; , &quot; Scientist&quot; &quot; Green Eyes &quot; , &quot; Amsterdam &quot; , &quot; A rush of blood to the head&quot; , protray their sturdyness and softness within them.<br />As a second album , this has outdone the first ( which is rarity and triumph for any band). Coldplay as a band have triumphed. Their voice , their songs , their music symbolise immense talent unfolding time after time.<br />3 words of advice - Pick this album.
B00007BH3A|5.0|The last reviewer was way out of line reviewing this limited edition version of No Doubt's multiplatinum &quot;Rock Steady&quot;. Yeah, maybe there's only two extra acoustic bonus tracks, but if you are like me, and didn't get the original version of the album before this came out, you should get this version. Afterall, for the same price, you do get two acoustic tracks that are unrehearsed and pretty good. Plus the &quot;Underneath It All&quot; video is great. And I don't know what the last review was talking about, saying that the tracks are mixed up. Completely untrue. Disc one has the same 13 tracks the orginal version has. Disc two is simply two bonus tracks and a music video that plays in your computer. So if you have the original version, don't worry too much about getting this, but if you haven't picked up the kick a** &quot;Rock Steady&quot; album yet, why not get this version that has some extra stuff for the same price? The songs are great. Highlights are &quot;Hella Good&quot;, &quot;Hey Baby&quot;, &quot;Making Out&quot;, &quot;Underneath It All&quot;, &quot;Detective&quot;, &quot;Don't Blow It&quot;, and &quot;Running&quot;.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|When I first heard of t.A.T.u. on MTV News, I immediately fell in love. I then downloaded all of their Russian music and I became addicted. Although I could not understand a word that they said, the tone of the music, combined with their superb voices, were able to portray a message that is as strong, if not stronger, than the lyrics themselves. The CD sends a message that hasn't been touched upon that much - homosexual love. These two girls are ready to take on America, and aren't afraid of any of the hatred they might recieve. I love t.A.T.u. and they deserve all the support in the world!!!

0812550706|5.0|I could probably write a book about how incredibly intense and powerful this book was. I read this on advice from 4 of my friends (simultaneously, to boot), and have to say I was reluctant because of the \\"sci-fi\\" stereotype in my head. However, this book blew past all of my reservations and is one of my all-time favorite books, one I would recommend to anyone, and I mean anyone, to read.<br />Orson Scott Card shows a stunning understanding of human nature and the plot twisted and was so amazingly real that I read it straight through in one night without a pause. <br />Read the book, and if you are not a shallow fool (and perhaps even if you are) you are bound to enjoy.
0345423496|3.0|This is better than 2061 but still not a great book. The ultimate demise of HAL and Bowman is moderately interesting but the rest of the book is pretty flat. Poole's tour of the future is fun but it really doesn't do anything dramatic for the story. It starts to but Clarke never really goes there-misfit out of time and place, etc.-in any convincing way. Other potentially interesting sources of human drama are also left dangling or never developed.<br />The best (or worst) indication of the book's quality is the fact that whole chapters are lifted verbatim from previous books in the series. 2061 does this in one justifiable scene but to do it again with the same text plus two more in the fourth novel is getting a little lazy. I was asked to read some of the same chapters three times between the books in the series.<br />The whole series is still worth a read but it's more like pulp than great literature. As far as that goes, it's pretty good pulp. But neither 2061 nor 3001 poses the same sort of challenging sci-fi ideas or storytelling as 2001 or 2010.
B000002H72|5.0|This album is perfect.  One of very few albums that I can play all the way through without the slightest desire to skip a track.  This album almost single-handedly gave birth to '90s Alternative Music.  This was Alternative back before it was called \\"Alternative\\"...back when it was just \\"College Music.\\"  And it's the real deal.  No poppy sell-out radio tunes here.  Just pure, undiluted brilliance.<br />The Pixies, as a band, were sheer genius.  As a lyricist and singer/screamer, Black Francis couldn't be touched, even when Kurt Cobain started writing songs that sounded like the Pixies and releasing gold records that were full of Black Francis-inspired howls.  Joey Santiago is definitely one of the most underrated guitarists ever in the history of rock music.  He played the guitar like he was insane, while Black Francis got worked up into a frenzy and convinced you that the whole BAND was insane.  And Kim Deal...great bass player, her steady, comparatively sane rhythms, along with those laid out by drummer David Lovering, complimented by contrast the insanity that was happening between Francis and Santiago.  This was one of the greatest bands ever, and this was their finest hour.<br />The album starts strong with \\"Debaser,\\" a song inspire by the film \\"Un Chien Andalou,\\" and proceeds down the road to madness with \\"Tame,\\" a brief scream-along tune that will knock your teeth out the first time you hear it.  And from there, it just gets better.  I won't go into every song, though every song is worth going into.  I'll conserve space here and just mention that \\"Hey\\" is, when you get right down to it, a beautiful and twisted song that everyone should know by heart.  Other great moments include \\"Crackity Jones,\\" \\"Gouge Away,\\" and \\"La La Love You,\\" an obvious shot at the radio-friendly pop music of the time, most notably Depeche Mode.<br />My suggestion is to buy this album immediately, as it will enrich the quality of your life...then, for an encore, buy the rest of the Pixies' albums.  Believe me, I don't just hand out five-star ratings.  Trust me when I say that this is one album you shouldn't be living without.
B00005RFQ5|5.0|The Rainbow Children is the most electrifying piece of masterful craft ever created on vinyl.  It is complete with full of the most creative instrumentals and lyrics I have ever heard.  Prince proves that his genius is limitless on this set.  Time and time again he wows the world with his vast musical abilities and places in our laps real music, instead of the muddy pop mess heard time and time again on the radio.  The Rainbow Children is the definitive record that sets the tone for the music for this century.  It is an absolute shame that this record was not widely heard by popular music, for, this would be the blueprint for pop music to follow.  The Jammz on this set are endless and limitless.  The title track is pure genius within itself and gives you this feeling of being in a complete state of euphoria.  \\"Who is your real father; the everlasting one\\", Prince tells in the masterpiece of a song.  Muse2thePharoah is a classic within itself with perfect poetry to end this jewel.  The stand out in the album is Family Name.  Wow.  This is one of the greatest pieces of rock, pop, and funky as hell funk I have ever heard.  The lyrics are ever so relevent and really forces you to think for a moment while patting your feet at the compelling riff of this joint.  <br />The Rainbow Children is the defining moment of Princes career proving that after 20 plus years, his best is still to come.
B000002A46|3.0|Didn't really care for her rendition of Silent Night, but the rest of the CD is pretty good.
0790741164|3.0|This is, in itself, a good movie. But much of it is highly dubious. Let me first say that I'm not one of the few who believes in the 'lone-nut', 'single-bullet' theories. Except for maybe Jack Ruby, but anyway. I fairly agree with the forensics(the \\"Hows\\"), I just totally disagree with the conspiracy theory behind it(the \\"Whys?\\").<br />To start with, the real John Fitzgerald Kennedy was not what he was portrayed to be. First of all, much of it was based on ineundoes, half-truths, and mere speculations. I think Stone's films 'Platoon' and 'Nixon' fairly accurate enough(both of which I loved). But it is highly unlikely that the conspiracy was the anti-Communistic scheme as shown in the movie. As mentioned, JFK was not the left-progressive martyr so portrayed. He was a strong Cold Warrior and had no intentions of withdrawing from Vietnam. Do I think it was a conspiracy? Yes. But it was most likely a Communist plot by the KGB, Cuba, and various Marxist groups who hated Kennedy. The fact that he was NOT going to end or avert the Vietnam War my have been a good enough motive for them to do it. Lee Harvey Oswald was a stauch Marxist, and in my opinion, he fired from the Book Depository(not delivering the fatal headshot wound from the grassy knoll). But if indead the CIA, etc. were involved all along may have ment that there WERE Communists infiltrating top levels of our gov't(declassified Soviets docs reveal that, McCarthy's shenanigans aside). <BR>  <BR> But this movie insists that it was a right-wing conspiracy out to kill the President. Scary enough I'll admit, but the theory that it was a Communist conspiracy is not only creepier, but more realistic, based on evidence.<br /> Was Kennedy a liberal? Of course, but in the centrist-liberal sense. He more than intended to win the Cold War, and who knows? Maybe he could have won the Vietnam War. Anyway, this movie was Stone's(and Garrison's) 'myth' compared to the Warren Report's 'myth'. And this is my 'myth'(a conspiracy ofCommunists, pro-Castro Cubans, KGB, and pro-Vietcong, anti-VN War)compared to both of the two. At lot people I've talked to tended believe it was a Marxist conspiracy. But who knows? It may have involved our own gov't(or parts of it) all along. Scary.
B00006ZSAD|4.0|This is definitely an album to buy whether you're a Portishead fan or not. Portishead fans may be disappointed by the lack of beats which more or less (besides Gibbons' eerie vocals) made Portishead what it was. Those distracted by the beats, bells, and whistles, will be instantly attracted to this record. Being a Portishead fan, I was mighty cynical about this recording. Not being sure how a musically sparse sound would compliment Beth's voice, but she does a great job of wrapping her vocals around the sparse textures of the instruments. And the backing vocals are amazing. Buy this record just for the backing and lead vocal balance. It'll blow your mind with each listen.
B00007BH5C|3.0|If you really enjoyed The Fellowship of the Rings, you're going to be disappointed.  The tracks in The Two Towers are no where near as moving as Shore's previous effort.  Buy it only if you're truely a dedicated Rings fan.
6303823351|2.0|...they were not trying to do a good act in the film, but they were trying to be a bad actor because they were not prefering the oscar prize.<BR>only for beatles fans, if u like them! the songs are okay but the acting is terrible and dumb!...
B00005QEPX|4.0|Her second album is different from her first one. There are less ballads and more latin-songs. I think the first one was better.<BR>Love don't cost a thing: Sounds a little bit like \\"If you had my love\\". A R n'B song. It's not bad. <BR>I'm real. The version without Ja Rule. This song has the most \\"Pop\\"<BR>Play: That's my favourite. A gret dancesong. An irresistible melody.<BR>Walking on sunshine: The only dancetack. But it's not as good as \\"Waiting for tonight\\".<BR>Ain't it funny: This poppish latin-song is my other favourite.<BR>Carino: Sounds similar to \\"AIF\\" but it's not as good.<BR>Come over: This should be sexy but I think it's more boring.<BR>We gotta talk: Another latin-song. None of her best.<BR>That's not me: This song has Hip Hop influences.<BR>Dance with me: Not the same song that Debelah Morgan or Destiny's Child sing. Very hot and nice to dance to.<BR>Secretly: This is a ballad. I don't like it that much.<BR>I'lm gonna be alright: Without Nas. This version is just as good but it's pop-music not Hip Hop.<BR>That's the way: A danceble Pop-Hip Hop-song.<BR>Dame: Another sexy Latin-song.<BR>Si ya se acabo: Again Latin. I like it.<BR>Pleasure is mine: A R n'B-song. It's so-so.<BR>I'm waiting. This is an electronic song.  It's great that Jennifer tries so many different types of music.<BR>I'm real: (Murder remix with Ja Rule). The better and more succesful version of this song doesn't sound like Track 2.
B00005JLWL|1.0|Let me put it bluntly: to like this film is to confess to a complete lack of interest in originality and quality.  First off, the story is a rip-off of classic sci-fi stories such as Farenheit 451.  Moreover, the plagerism is pulled off so badly you could swear on you mother's grave a five year-old wrote the script. I mean, please: \\"in the future, to avoid a fourth world war, humans repress emotion, which they believe to be the principle cause of war.\\"<br />I would feel insulted if I were any of the actors.  The lines (which I have repressed forever) are atrocious, the stuff of the Sci-Fi Channel's worst series.<br />In the end, like The Matrix, this movie (probably at the insistence of its producers) fails to deal with any part of the story per se.  There is only action and special effects.  That's it, fin, end of story, ponto final, made for the type of person who refuses, if even for a second, to utilize a single neuron during the film's presentation.  To say this movie insults the viewer is a gargantum understatement.
B000008GEF|5.0|Probaly the most underrated album of all time.  A great piece of work.  I could never understand why this album never got the praise it deserves.  Expectations too high after ATMP maybe?  But jeez: if this isn't good enough for you, there's something wrong with you. At least it did make it to #1, which it certainly deserved.  In many ways it's a stronger work than ATMP.  The writing is more consistent in overall quality.  And the sound is way, way better.  The production job on this album is excellent. One of the best produced albums from a former Beatle and without question George's best produced album. Very meaty R&B sound (reminiscent of \\"Savy Truffle\\" from the Beatles' white album) on many of the tracks.  Great sax, piano and guitar work. And Harrison's singing is the best of his career on this album. A shame he didn't bring the same quality of production to subsequent albums instead of opting for a softer, etheral sound. Not a lot of depth to the lyrics perhaps but - I dunno - overall it sounds awfully [darn] good to me.  I recently listened to LITMW after getting his superb last album, \\"Brainwashed\\" which I initially thought may have been better. In fact, several songs on \\"Brainwashed\\" exceed anything on LITMW (especially lyrically) and his slide playing on several \\"Brainwashed\\" songs is the best of his career, but overall LITMW packs a heavier punch. Bottom line: great mid-70's rock that still sounds great 30 years later.
0061020710|4.0|Rincewind the (mostly) failed wizard is forced into a series of adventures with an insurance risk assessor \\"tourist\\" named Twoflower. Along for the ride is Twoflower's sentient, mobile, and ferocious luggage.<br />I'd heard many good things about the Pratchett's Discworld books, and so decided to start the series with the first published book. It wasn't quite what I expected. Don't get me wrong, Pratchett is a very good writer, but this book didn't reach out and grab me like I thought it would. Perhaps I'd read too much about how funny the Discworld books are. This one had a number of chuckles (some laugh out loud) but generally read more as consistently amusing than roll-on-the floor funny. Most of the fun comes from the interaction between Rincewind's pathetic, survivalist instincts, and Twoflower's tourist mindset.  Pratchett also pokes fun at various fantasy clich&eacute;s -- the magic sword, the brave hero, and the gods, to name a few. The main problem with \\"The Color of Magic\\" is that much of the story wasn't funny or unique enough to push it above the level of ordinary good fantasy.<br />I can see lots of potential in Pratchett's writing so I'll definitely read more of the Discworld series. It often takes authors a few books before they hit their stride and I suspect that this is the case for Pratchett.
B000077VPU|4.0|...where's the first part of the show?!  If that was included, the DVD would get 6 stars!  First of all, how could such a line-up ... be anything but extraordinary, and it is!  All the performers gave it their all, and none of them disappoint, stepping into Freddie's shoes for just one night (the dream of a lifetime for the \\"new generation\\" bands), putting their personal spin on Classic Queen, and giving moving, personal messages about AIDS (such as George Michael's in-your-face awareness message, and David Bowie on one knee, giving the Lord's Prayer!).  Top that off with superior digital DVD picture and sound, and WOW, this is the ultimate rock show, and a very moving tribute to the late, lamented, great Freddie Mercury (don't we love him so?).  Also, delightfully included, are the Freddie montages they showed while setting up each act, great interviews with Queen and the other artists, and some interesting rehearsal footage (from Annie Lennox/David Bowie, and George Michael/Lisa Stansfield).  I don't regret buying the DVD in any way, even at full price, because the proceeds go to AIDS work, but I will forever wonder what happened to the other part of the show (were their legalities, or did they just forget?!), and I will have to go buy the VHS to suppliment the concert.  In the meantime, this great show must go on and on in my DVD player, and you'll like it in yours, too.
B00004T9VY|5.0|\\"Tea for the Tillerman\\" still beckons to be heard, a rare feat for any popular recording that has aged beyond 30 years. Cat Stevens completely transcends the self-conscious trappings that plague many musicians and delivers a sparkling testimony about the life of a seeker.<br />Though undercurrents of melancholy run through many songs, Mr. Stevens does not give in to sadness and depression. Instead, the theme of love lost in the classic Wild World absolves his lost lover and warns her about the ways of the world. He confronts dying with an unflinching resolve in But I Might Die Tonight and appeals to the ideas of Zen in the muscular, celebratory Miles from Nowhere. Mr. Stevens raises the eco-flag in Where Do the Children Play, which still sounds relevant despite a few archaic (at least to current American sensibilities) words such as \\"lorry.\\"<br />He visits the quest motif more than once---perhaps an indication of his own state of mind at that time---in the jaunty On the Road to Findout and the plaintive dialogue that captures the essence of the generation gap in Father and Son. In Sad Lisa, he confronts a quest of a different sort, chronicling the narrator's efforts to deal with some form of mental illness, though it's not entirely clear if Lisa is real or an apparition only the narrator can see.<br />Mr. Stevens also delves into the possibly related themes of contacts with UFOs in the metaphorical Longer Boats and experimentation with psychotropic drugs as he catalogs images and experiences that merge Into White.<br />The stellar band that supply the musical textures here are in fine form, especially second guitarist Alun Davies, long the unsung hero on the best of Cat Steven's recordings. Mr. Stevens and Mr. Davies interweave melodies and ideas so seamlessly that it's almost impossible to separate one from the other. The rhythm section here ranges, whether nearly muted or unleashing torrents of energy, never intrudes but always anchors the songs. The strings on \\"Tea for the Tillerman\\" sparkle like moonlight on the ocean, offering subtle relief and counterpoint without choking out the music as they do on some of Mr. Steven's later recordings.<br />Mr. Stevens made many excellent recordings, some good ones, and one transcendent one, \\"Tea for Tillerman.\\" I hope that he has found the peace he sought and am thankful for this gift he left us before entering the life of contemplation and devotion that beckoned him.\\"Tea for the Tillerman\\" sparkle like moonlight on the ocean, offering subtle relief and counterpoint without choking out the music as they do on some of Mr. Steven's later recordings. <br />Mr. Stevens made many excellent recordings, some good ones, and one transcendent one, \\"Tea for Tillerman.\\" I hope that he has found the peace he sought and am thankful for this gift he left us before entering the life of contemplation and devotion that beckoned him.

B00003CXXP|5.0|Don't let the simple minds of mainstream viewers deter you from thinking that this is absolutely one magnificently beautiful film. It's definitly on my top 5 list of greatest movies ever. <BR>First off, let's get something straight, Steven Spielberg directed this film, NOT Stanley Kubrick. Kubrick only first conjured the idea from the film after reading the early 80's short story \\"Super Toys Last All Summer Long.\\" Kubrick wanted Spielberg to direct this film, and since Kubrick was never able to, Spielberg took the honor after Kubrick's death. <BR>This film stars Haley Joel Osment as a robotic child (mecha child) named David made for a family who's son is in a coma and may never recover. This couple acts as the guinea pigs for this new robot child. The couple's child comes to, and the couple realizes having a robot child just isn't safe for their real son, so they abandon David, just because they don't have the heart to destroy him. David then goes off on a search to find the \\"blue fairy\\" (taken from the Pinnochio story read to him by his \\"mother\\") along with Gigalo Joe (a lover mecha magnificently acted by Jude Law) to make him into a real live boy so his parents will accept him again. <BR>What makes this film incredible is basically everything, from the script, the directing, cinemotography, actors and metaphors. Everything falls right into place and just makes this one breathtaking film which leads to a tearjerker ending (that is if you're open minded enough to read deeper into the ending then for the face value of what it is). <BR>This message (what I believe to be the hidden message of the film) goes to show people something, something special about themselves and why we should appreciate the world around us. I really can't imagine any real film fanatic thinking this isn't an incredible film. Steven Spielberg is definitly one of the best out there.

So put on some sneakers, go clean your sink and get started, as soon as you read the book, that is....
B000069AUI|5.0|I bought this album strictly because of how much I enjoyed the Parachutes album.  In fact, when I purchased A Rush of Blood to the Head, I convinced myself that if this album is only 1/2 as good as Parachutes, it would be a solid album and worth the 15 bucks I spent for it.  To my utter amazement, A Rush of Blood to the Head not only exceeded my expectations, but it also exceeded the level of musical quality and innovation Parachutes exudes.  This album ranks on my Top 10 albums of all time list for sure.
B00005B36H|3.0|This is WAY too long and has its boring stretches, but it's surprisingly quite enjoyable. The graphic design is interesting, although it's just as &quot;no fun&quot; as always. It's interesting that the singles from this record, while melodic and interesting OUT of context, turn out to be so weak as pieces of the whole. <BR>The lyrics are still relatively meaningless and the album still succumbs to its own indulgence more often than not, hence the rating. This is Tool's best album, I'd say, which makes it all the more interesting that all the Tool fans I know seem to despise it!
B000002JNJ|5.0|This and Vulgar Display are Pantera at the top of their style. <BR>They gave Metal a fresh kick start to the 90&quot;s.

B000067CPX|4.0|For 20 years now the Red Hot Chili Peppers have, on the whole, provided a very urban, very hard edged, funky sound occasionally broken by melancholy, bittersweet ballads as counterpoint.<br />On By the Way the Peppers have taken a markedly different path.  The tike track aside, this is not an album that can in any way be characterized as \\"Hard-edged\\"-at least insofar as the sound of the album is concerned. (The lyrics are a different matter on some tracks.)  The energy, angst, anger and alienation that fueled much of their music is supremely sublimated on this album.  The sound is much more uniform, more thoroughly melodic, than has traditionally been the norm.<br />On the whole, this is a very good album, though one that takes some acclimation for the die hard Peppers fan (a group I can claim association with).  However, the album grows on you, and after a while the anticipation of a musical explosion of one sort or another passes and you can relax and get into this more mellow sound.<br />On the other hand, there is something of a sense of disappointment.  The absence of the funky rap style is noticeable and there is a dearth of the memorable, dynamic, gut wrenching, heartfelt primal scream that one expects from the Peppers-no Scar Tissue, no Give it Away Now, no Under the Bridge sort of tunes to be found here.<br />The real question is-Is this the new Peppers or an aside?  Have they evolved into a more tranquil musical zone?  I hope not.  I like this-I loved what came before it.  I'd like to think that there's still enough residual anger, angst and attitude to provide the occasional musical kick in the pants the Peppers used to be known for.  <br />In the meantime, sit back and enjoy.  As I say, it'll grow on you.
0066214122|4.0|This book follows the same 30+ year-old Crichton formula as _The Andromeda Strain_, _Jurassic Park_, _Sphere_, _Timeline_, etc.: a cautionary tale of science and technology involving an insolated location, ending in disaster. The characters are clichés (our introduction to the adolescent daughter includes her yelling \\"I hate you!\\" to one of her parents) and some of the plot twists are clumsy. But hey, I bet you already knew that without reading the book. Why? This is a Michael Crichton novel, and you've probably read him before. Some of the other reviewers seemed to expect something different, and I'm not sure why. I guess it's this kind of thinking that keeps the lottery in business.<br />So you know what you're getting. And with that expectation, I found this to be a fun, page-turning book. This time, Crichton writes in 1st person so that he can stop the story and have the viewpoint character explain points of technology. I found this mildly annoying, but the alternatives would probably have been more awkward. Overall, it was worth my time. I was entertained, and that's worth four stars.<br />Honestly, though, you've read this book before. If you're interested in reading about emergent systems without the fiction, I enjoyed _Emergence: The Connected Lives of Ants, Brains, Cities, and Software_ by Stephen Johnson. Or, you could do worse than discovering a new author for your reading time; there are plenty of great writers out there that would love to have you as a reader.

B00006AFUR|4.0|usually I don't go for the whole, I'm an actor I an sing too, deal. but Leto pulls it off rather well. I enjoy 30 secs. because unlike Deadsy (a totally \\"bad\\" band) these guys aren't trying to shock and devour others. Deadsy is just a band for the Korn people. I like Korn, but i am annoyed by deadsy.<br />Give 30 secs a chance. You won't be disapponited.

1567184855|2.0|I found this book to be entirely unobjective and self indulgent. The book purports to tell you just about everything there ever was to know about souls. The apparent source of this information is a number of anonymous hypnotic subjects regressed to a previous inter earthly existence as a soul in higher dimension.<BR> Immediately the rather large  ostensive claims of this book should make normally open minded people scamble for cover.<BR> In as much as the jury is still out on if human personality survives  death, it amazes that this book has every answer including the reworking of souls so terrible they cannot be salvaged. I had a long laugh at some of the reported spiritual experiences , i.e. the one where the reporting person sees his spiritual master with a devil's mask. The Master is just trying to scare the poor apprentice soul! <BR> Surely if souls come to this plane with free will,  even the murderer and the felon must have a purpose. That purpose is to challenge other victim souls who need to test their metal. How could heavan judge a human villan even as horrendous a Jeffrey Dalmer as anything more than a sick brain that hopefully as a soul recognizes his role in the human drama as the villan.  This book will be applauded by the gullible and laughed at my persons such as myself seeking answers to what if anything survives death.
B00006ADFL|5.0|Taking place in the 1950's in Christchurch New Zealand. Heavenly Creatures is based on a true story about the intense bond of two girls Pauline Yvonne Rieper and Juliet Hulme.<br />I think for Pauline in particular this friendship is very important. Pauline is moody person, an introvert of very strong character, kind of a tom boy, with short black unruly curls.<BR>Her father runs a fish shop, and her mother is a house wife, their working-class home also doubles as a boarding house. <BR>She may have feelings of inadequetcy, because of scars on her legs, leaving them brittle, from a childhood illness. But when she meets Juliet Hulme it seems she's met her soul mate.  <br />Juliet is an extrovert, worldly and outspoken, she even corrects the French teacher on her first day.<br />Juliet is impressed with Pauline's scars, she has scars too, on her lungs from a childhood bout with tuberculosis.<br />Juliet's parents left her in the Bahamas &quot;for the good of her health&quot; and she didn't see them for five whole years. Juliet tells Pauline &quot;All the best people have bad chests and bone diseases, it's all frightfully romantic!&quot;<br />Pauline finds refuge at Juliet's enormous upper-class house, where they play and obsess in their made-up world of Borovnia, they write about the escapades of their imaginary alter egos and their fantasy family. Juliet becomes Deborah and Pauline becomes Gina (a beautiful gypsy). and they revel in the music of Mario Lanza, the worlds greatest tenor! <br />But Juliets parents seem rather cold and aloof. Her mother is a marriage counselor, she has a special technique called &quot;deep therapy&quot;.<BR>And her father is an esteemed University rector. He is the first to question the intensity of Pauline and Juliet's relationship. He suggests to the Riepers that Pauline may be growing in a &quot;wayward&quot; fashion and suggests a psychiatrist.<br />However, Pauline seems oblivious to this. She thinks of Mr. Hulme. as the kindest man she's ever known.<BR>Pauline begins to grow desperate, at the idea that someone may try to come in between her and Juliet, particularly her mother. Who seems to grow concerned at Pauline's total obsession with her stories (and uninterest in school) and especially after a short affair with a male boarder, their relationship is rocky.<br />Whereas Pauline truly has loving parents, her friendship with Juliet is so important to her, it seems to have altered her reality. And the tension builds when Juliet's parents announce they are getting divorced and Mr. Hulme is taking Juliet and her brother to South Africa.<br />The story is absolutely true.<BR>The narration of the film was taken directly from the actual diaries entries of Pauline, which was discovered buried in her backyard by the police. And Peter Jackson, said he filmed most of the scenes in the actual location of the real events. <BR>Melanie Lynsky who portrays Pauline, is MAGNIFICENT! Her performance in fantastic, and seems so real.<BR>Those scenes in which she cries, are so excruiating to watch, because she's actually sobbing, and at the same time it's just facinating.<BR>She's also very charming. I think you'll like her right away. <BR>Kate Winslet is also wonderful. This must have been he first film for each of them, because in the opening sequence is says &quot;and introducing Melanie Lynsky &amp; Kate Winslet&quot;<br />Filmed in Christchurch New Zealand, Heavenly Creatures is a FACINATING and an absolutely ENGROSSING film. If you like movie of &quot;dark&quot; genre, you'll be awe-struck.<br />As an interesting side note, The girls were spared harsh punishment because of their ages. Juliet Hulme, changed her name to Anne Perry and is now a writer (of fictional crime) Anne Perry herself admits this. There has been speculation as to what has become of Pauline. But one source says, she changed her name to Hilary Nathan and is an ex-librarian, devout Catholic (almost became a nun) and now runs a riding schoolin rural England. This is from NZ (New Zealand) Woman's Weekly magazine 1997 in an article written by Chris Cooke.<br />I don't think I gave too much of the plot away :-)<BR>I'm such a fan of this movie :-) I'm so glad it's finally on DVD!
B000000WHX|5.0|Like one of the other reviewers said, reviewing a Massive Attack record isn't easy. Mezzinene was different because of its more stand out elements(deeper production, stronger melody, encompassing atmosphere). Here we see far different MA than what most people are used to(Mezzinene the starting record for most Massive Attack fans). This is not to sell Blue Lines short because this album is nothing short of genius.<br />The main thing about this album that can be hard to sell(especially to today's music crowd) is that it's a very subtile record. No sound, instrument, effect, or scratch really stands out. Instead they serve mostly as a comforting pillow which the vocals rest upon. They meld together perfectly that makes for a very soothing, comforting listen. Everything sort of creeps up you and seeps into your mind as you soon find yourself chanting &quot;Man, this is great!&quot;.<br />As for the music itself, its a mix of downtempo dance, electronica, dub, lazy rap,and regae(which later would become defined as trip-hop). The vocals are mix of different artists(soon to be solo artist, Tricky, Sarah, Mushroom 3-D, and of course regae star Horace Andy) ranging from divas to rappers to that bizare sound that Horace Andy makes(you know what I'm talking about). All the different style add variety, giving each track its own unique touch. Apart they work as seperate songs due to strength of song writing. Together, they form this awesome album called Blue Lines.<br />Not everyone will dig this. Some will say that it's sounds way to early 90s to be listenible. True, Blue Lines is not nearly acessible as Mezzinene, but if you have a little patience, you'll find this to be an unbeilevable album and certainly worth you money. Its inching its way up to be my favorite Massive Attack record. To think, over eleven years ago, this CD spawned an entirely new music scene. Worth the hype. Buy this album
B000067CPX|5.0|I know a lot of fans really dont like this album very much.  its just that they did evolve and change. i think thats nessassary for a band to stay around for as long as they have.  and i think there evolvement was pretty easy to see.. with some songs on californication like road trippin' you could tell that rhcp were moving away from their previous albums.  i think this is there best album yet.. its more laid back and not as aggressive as previous.  i think one of the best things about this album is how anthony's voice has really acutally developed into something quite good.  also, even though fruciante doesn't have as many failing flying riffs, i'd say the cool funky beat is just as cool if not better. i think anybody who really appreicates the rhcp and music in general will agree this is one masterpiece
B00006M183|2.0|Forget creativity....WHERE'S THE GRUNGE!!<br />With each record, these guys get closer and closer to REO Speedwagon.  \\"Love Boat Captain\\"?  Sounds like a ballad for a Titanic movie made in the 70s.<br />Whatever happened to PJ classics like \\"Alive\\" and \\"Evenflow\\"?  It seems they've fallen by the wayside, allowing more talented bands like Creed and Nickelback to take over the grunge title from Vedder.<br />On the positive side, STP's new album should arrive soon.<br />Let's get it back to what it used to be, guys.  <br />TAKE CARE!!
B000068PQ0|4.0|Macabre and distressing? Perhaps but more than that the Flaming Lips break through into the epiphany - discovering rather than creating with delicate and sophisticated production with an ability to make the miraculous seem possible. It's an album you can live inside for months. From the exalted beauty of 'are you a hypnotist??' to the surreal splendor of 'in the morning of the magician' the Flaming Lips take on a life affirming quality.<BR>Stand out moment is during 'do you realise??' with the lyric &quot;you realise the sun doesn't go down it's just an illusion caused by the world spinning' round&quot;.
B00005JKCH|2.0|I love the movie, I think it is wonderful.  However I was EXTREMELY dissapointed with the bonus features.  With two discs you would think that they could have put the deleted scenes in there somewhere.  My main purpose in buying it was for the now infamous cut scene with the twin towers.  I would have returned it but my husband wouldn't let me.
B00004RJ71|5.0|I was introduced to this movie several years ago by a friend and have loved it ever since.  It has great characters and a compelling storyline that keeps you interested throughout.  The absolute best part of the movie though is the quotes.  My favorites are \\"In you dreams Pedro, in you dreams\\" (Big AL)  \\"I'm gonna lick you clean\\"  (Miklo to Big Al)  and of course \\"Vatos Locos forever man.\\" There are too many good quotes to mention them all.  This movie is a must see for everyone no matter what backround you come from.  If you haven't seen it yet shut off your computer this instant and run to the video store. You won't regret it.  BTW Does anyone else think Miklo looks a little like Emilio Estevez????
B00006F7S4|5.0|One of the saddest things I have ever heard.  But one of the best.  Beck, being the chameleon of music has covered just about everything out there, fusion, country, metal to syntho-driven beats.  Here he and producer Nigel Godrich put together an album that will either put you to sleep or make you cry, or both.  It has rich landscaping texture that almost resembles Radiohead (Nigel Godrich).  If  you are a fan of either Beck or Radiohead and don't mind to be depressed for the better part of an hour (if you like Radiohead then you won't), then you need to make this album a part of your library.  Favourite tracks: The Golden Age, Lonesome Tears,  End of the Day,  Round the Bend, Already Dead.
B0000028UK|5.0|One thing ive noticed is a lot of reviewers dislike this album because most of the tracks are in pearl jam(ming) mode. What is the problem? Soo they like to jam... big deal. can u imagine how boring these songs would be WITHOUT killer solos at the end. Pearl Jam is a rock band and rock is about meaningful lyrics AND killer solos!! And i also think this is the best pearl jam album because its far less commercial than Ten (Jeremy was such a soft, boring song for example). In my oppinion Pearl Jam sound a lot better in this album then in Ten and have produced a much more rounded album. Elderly Woman, go, animal, dissident, rearviewmirror and daughter are all solid tracks and the solos are KILLER! Basically this album also has 2 of the best ballards pearl jam have ever produced in Elderly Woman and Daughter. THIS ALBUM HAS MUCH MORE PLAYABILITY BECAUSE YOU PROBABLY HAVENT HEARD ALL THESE SONGS 1MILLION TIMES ON RADIO ALSO.. :)
B000002UAU|5.0|Sgt. Pepper is one of those albums that it is almost superfluous to review. Like Bob Dylan's holy trinity of mid-60's albums, Jimi Hendrix's debut, and the best of the Stones and Zeppelin, outside of any subjective critical opinion, it will always remain a landmark - not only an ackwnoledged masterpiece and enormously influential, but a cultural touchstone as well. The question is, then, Does it actually deserve its reputation? After being hailed for over 30 years as nothing less than The Greatest Album of All-Time, one obviously comes into the album with extremely lofty expectations. Clearly, it can be understood how those hearing the album for the first time may find it to be a bit of an anti-climax at first - and it, of course, can not possibly mean as much to anyone hearing it today for the first time as it did to those who heard it upon release: decades worth of albums extolling the virtues which it pioneered have seen to that. To truly understand the signifigance of Sgt. Pepper, one must imagine how grandiose it seemed upon release. The production, clear and crystaline, still sounds amazing - and even relevant - today; just imagine how it must have appeared in 1967! A totally revolutionary album that clearly paved the way for later rock masterpieces such as Pink Floyd's The Dark Side of The Moon - what with its song segues and pseudo-concept - Sgt. Pepper is, perhaps, the most influential rock album ever recorded. In addition to this, it also did much toward getting rock music recognized as legitimate art. However, all of these things are always mentioned in regards to Sgt. Pepper and widely noted. A fact often lost in the shuffle is the album's consistently brilliant songwriting. Though Dylan got the ball rolling, The Beatles popularized the concept of writing your own material - unbelievable as this may sound today, this was unheard of a mere 5 years before the album's release. The Beatles show on this album why they, collectively and individually, were andalways will be the greatest songwriters in rock. The album's semi-concept, with its title track and subsequent reprise, were epic in scope in a way unheard of at the time and even rarely matched since. The album itself works well as almost one seamless, flawless piece of music (with only the tossed-off Being For The Benefit of Mr. Kite! hampering the album down.) Individual highlights range from the sing-along fun of With A Little Help From My Friends; to Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds, a psychedelic masterpiece and perhaps the greatest drug song of all-time; to Harrison's enigmatic, sitar-tinged Within You Without You; to When I'm Sixty Four, a very typical McCartney song that harkens the album back to earlier, simpler Beatles material. McCartney, it must be noted, wrote the majority of the album (and sang most of the songs), and he deserves to be commended for that. That said, aside from the aforementioned Mr. Kite, Lennon's songs here are all stunning masterpieces. In addition to Lucy, he also contributed Good Morning, Good Morning, a great song with caustically biting lyrics (not to mention one of George's best guitar solos), as well as the majority of A Day In The Life, one of the best Beatles songs ever, with its beautiful vocal and absolutely perfect ending, incorporating the famous sustained piano chord. This is the last time on record that The Beatles, aside from the famous ending suite on Abbey Road, would ever truly work together as a unit. No doubt an album of such staggering success and influence would have a possible detrimental effect on any band - much less one ripe with such invidivual talent (not to mention ego and girlfriend problems) as The Beatles. Though thankfully not a swan song, this is an obvious epoch in the band's history, and a rightfully lauded masterpiece. One of the best rock albums ever made, yes, and as essential as bread and water.
B000002BFZ|4.0|Normally i would give ANY Pearl Jam album 5 stars (I think they are by far the best band of the 90s) because they always consistently provide great albums with INNOVATION which a lot of bands lack these days. The reason why i give this one 4 is that although this album is very very solid (ie all tracks are listenable) their are not many exellent tracks.. no Betterman, Alive, Black, Elderly Woman, Daughter, Given to fly's. Sure Hail Hail, Lukin, Sometimes and Smile are gooood but only Hail Hail is really in the same league as those songs mentioned above. DEFINITELY worth the cash though.
B00006690G|5.0|It's rare to find an artist so unapologetically real.  Eminem's lyrics are excellent.  The key to his success, if you ask me, is that Eminem speaks about his problems in a way that people can relate to.  His lyrics aren't always pretty but they express very well.  Everyone can identify at some time in their lives with what Eminem is feeling.  Buy this CD.
B00000G3Q4|5.0|this is one of the all time greats but for those who found it scary i pity you
B00007EL92|5.0|This release presents the first ever surround 5.1 release by the King and you don't even need to own a DVD-Audio player as the disc is fully compatible with Dolby decoders, what a blast!<br />The separation between instruments and voices on this surround release is simply incredible, a whole new dimension in terms of the oftentimes lacklustre sound quality of so many Elvis reissues on CD over the years.<br />The added dimensions in the 50's and 60's tracks (reverb in the rear channels) are very realistic to say the least, and both &quot;In The Ghetto&quot; and &quot;Suspicious Minds&quot; are the definitive highlights (one would hope that all 1969 session material will get the same treatment one day but I wouldn't hold my breath).<br />While this DVD-A does not include a system menu (who needs 'em anyways) it does actually have two Dolby Digital tracks, 5.1 and 2.0 (the bonus tracks are in 2.0 only), allowing for crafty manipulations by the various Dolby surround modes in your processor!<br />This is definitely a pure joy and more fun than you'll ever have with any other Elvis release (you can actually get Elvis in the center channel after all, which unfortunately does not get much use in the surround mix at all).<br />This DVD-A is a handsdown winner and a big thank you goes to BMG, especially for choosing to go with DVD-Audio!  It seems SACD releases in multi-channel are still a rarity in the pop world, besides with the Dolby tracks you can actually engage your processor (which would simply sit idle with SACD!).<br />Keep 'em coming, BMG, it's the 21st century, there's no reason to hold back on other equally carefully remixed Elvis tracks!  It's just amazing to see the King leapfrogging ahead once again and beat the competition outright (Beatles or Stones in surround anyone?)
1881273156|5.0|WOW!  I have one chapter to go in this book.  In just this weekend, I can already see my marriage changing.  I am sure if my husband reads it too, I will notice even more changes.  I have learned how to 'choose' to love and why the original love experience doesn't last.  His concept is so simple that just about any two people could live together successfully, so long as they stuck to his guidelines.  WOW!  I can't say enough good things about this book.
B000002KD9|3.0|ATGR and Harvest are constantly described as Neil's best albums, but in my opinion, neither has stood the test of time as well as many of his other albums, and are both decidely patchy and uneven.<br />Tell Me Why and Only Love Can Break Your Heart are tedious mid-tempo plodders with banal lyrics.  Two songs (which closed each side of the LP in the dear old days of vinyl) are complete throw-aways.  Charming, I suppose, when you first play the record, but 30 years on, pretty boring.  Even in the aforementioned days of vinyl, this left a pretty uneven album:  in the days of CD, you are liable to feel short-changed.  Neil isn't at his best when covering other people's songs (a notable exception is 'The Wayward Wind' on Old Ways), and Oh, Lonesome Me is a dreary dirge, which introduces Don't Let It Bring You Down, another, self-penned, dreary dirge.  However, this album does have at least one bona fide certified classic:  Southern Man, which has lost none of its power, truly one of Neil's greatest songs (an even better version is to be found on the otherwise mostly hopeless Journey Through the Past album).  The sentiments of the title track are a little sentimental and hippy-ish to have aged well, but it is a nice performance with Neil at the piano.  The album's other rocker, When You Dance, is probably its best moment after Southern Man, although the ballads I Believe in You (in which Neil makes effective use of his limited vocal range) and Birds are also pretty damn fine.  Probably three and a half stars would be about right for this inconsistent album.  Actually, a lot of Neil's seventies albums are patchy and uneven, but tend to get overrated because of one or two outstanding tracks (Zuma, for instance).  There are at least a dozen Neil Young albums that are better than this:  Time Fades Away, On the Beach, Tonight's the Night, Comes A Time, Rust Never Sleeps, Trans, Old Ways, This Note's For You, Freedom, Ragged Glory, Harvest Moon, Sleeps With Angels, Silver and Gold.  In anyone else's canon, however, this would be a fine album.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne has a great album! I recommend buying it if you're at the music store and not sure what to buy. All the songs are cool and you can listen to it all the way through many times without getting bored. My favorite song besides &quot;Complicated&quot; is probably &quot;I'm With You&quot; or &quot;Losing Grip&quot;. You need to buy this album, you won't regret it.
B0000542D2|5.0|Albert and David Maysles were on the scene for the Beatles first arrival in America {including the two Ed Sullivan Show appearances and live concerts} in 1964.

B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina Aguilera has gone from snotty pop princess, to a beautiful lovely woman. Her music has actually touched me with this album. All I can say it wow. Her voice was smooth and angelic. She never tried to upstage herself like she did in previous albums. And amazingly, she co-wrote the majority of this album. I can't believe it at all! She worked with Alicia Keys and was also accompanied by Lil' Kim. The sound is a complete mix of R&amp;B, soul, latin, and alittle rock. Not one bit of perky pop at all! I must say, I never liked her before but after this album, I appreciate her! Must buy!
B000002UAO|5.0|In 1965, the Beatles were heavily influenced by Bob Dyaln, marijuana, and fascinating new studio techniques. All of these elements are heard on &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;, the album that &quot;changed&quot; the fab four forever. Instead of cranking out two singles and filling the other two sides with unmemorable throw-away cuts, emphasis was now put on each individual song, something unheard of in the heyday of AM radio.  Acoustic guitars were more present than before, which is actually a healthy change. Songs like &quot;The Word&quot;, &quot;Think for Yourself&quot;, and &quot;I'm Looking Through You&quot; redefined the pop song by searching for more meaning, and thus exploring more ground than anyone had ever done before in a three minute track. Along with the Beach Boys' &quot;Pet Sonds&quot; this sets the standard for Pop Albums, and is still regarded as the Beatles' masterpiece.
B00007ELEL|5.0|I'm a dedicated Coen fan, and I must confess it took a little time for this one to grow on me, but it's an instant classic.  The characters are well-drawn and memorable, and John Goodman is an utter comedic gem in a role written expressly with him in mind.<br />The language is a bit, er, extreme -- I have a download of the movie script and it averages five occurrences of the &quot;F&quot; word on each and every page.  Still, who can resist a bunch of bowlers who speak in the vocabulary of college professors?  This is a device the Coens employed to wonderful effect in &quot;Raising Arizona&quot; and &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot; (except those involved hicks speaking like college professors) -- and it's used to its full potential here.<br />See this movie.  Soon enough you'll be speaking in &quot;Big Lebowski&quot; lines as we so often do at my house:  &quot;World of pain.&quot;  &quot;Donny, you're out of your league!&quot; &quot;They're nihilists, man.  They believe in nothing!&quot; &quot;D'you have to use so many cuss words?&quot; &quot;Don't be fatuous, Jeffrey.&quot;

This book and &quot;Making Faces&quot; have changed my whole outlook on make-up and how I use it to my great joy!<br />You should read the entire front section and it may help to have &quot;Making Faces&quot; as well to understand all that he shows you in this book. But it is mostly intuative once you get going!<br />Hurrah for Kevin and my deepest sorrow that he was taken from this earth much too soon.
B00005JL2O|5.0|I thought that the series had run out of originality, Mike Myers has to prove me wrong.  The first ten minutes are so creative and packed full of cameos (and if you tell your friends who the cameos appearances are  your friends will never forgive you) that it sets the pace for the rest of the film perfectly.  Even the jokes that he has used in past films he somehow manages to renew and make fresh again.  For those parents out there  watch out  this is a very risqué film and should probably have been rated R.  That being said, the adult humor is what makes this film so great in the first place.<br />If you thought the first and second in the series were groovy, you're going to love the third
B000002LIX|5.0|With every passing year Jane's Addiction, like so many other once-unstoppable bands, sounds a little less scandalous.  How could they not considering how thinly their creative legacy has been spread, borrowed, stretched and stolen?  As KRS-1 once said, it's inevitable that music become watered down.  And though many of the bands that owe their very ethos to Jane's may themselves be excellent (from giants like Pearl Jam and NIN to midgets like Anandasong and Houston), the enigmatic originality of Jane's Addiction continues to dilute.  It is an unavoidable shame that they will never sound as powerful as they truly were to anyone but those who were listening from the beginning.<br />People sometimes forget (or never knew in the first place) that Ritual de lo Habitual was released in a year ruled by bands like Skid Row, Poison, Ratt, Warrant, and Slaughter.  (Remember Slaughter?)  Say what you will about these bands, they were the definition of late eighties/early nineties commercial Rock, and they were the antithesis of Jane's Addiction's &quot;Art first, flash second&quot; mindset.  More-or-less straight ahead Rock songs like &quot;Stop&quot; and &quot;Ain't No Right&quot; keep strange company next to Poison's &quot;Unskinny Bop&quot; and Ratt's &quot;Lovin' You's a Dirty Job.&quot;<br />But Jane's Addiction dabbled in far more than mere riffs and hooks, as &quot;Three Days&quot; and &quot;Then She Did...&quot; aptly demonstrate.  Veritable epics of early seventies Glam Rock/Proto Punk composition, these tracks feature a textural and orchestral finesse unmatched by any other band with as few pretensions as Jane's.  Certainly one could argue this statement by citing a band like Queensryche, but one could also set one's hair on fire to win a bet.<br />Ritual de lo Habitual did for Rock and Roll what Thoreau's Walden did for literature: reinvented the wheel by simply giving it corners.

B00000G3PA|2.0|Armageddon is the low-intelligence, B-type film that seems to have become so typical of uber-producer Jerry Bruckheimer, with the exception of last year's Black Hawk Down, which I have not seen, yet, and which has gotten positive reviews. The plot structure is very weak, and the characters are paper thin.<br />The film opens with a meteor shower raining down on the earth from space, debris from an asteroid the size of Texas. After a sequence of mass destruction taking place in a big city, the government learns of the Texas-sized asteroid, and that it's going to strike Earth, which would result in the end of mankind. <br />The solution is to form a group of expert drillers who must travel to the asteroid and drill a hole through it, so the asteroid splits in half. That way, hopefully, the split asteroid chunks would miss Earth on it course through space. So a misfit group of oil drillers find themselves the ones for the job. The fate of planet Earth rests on their shoulders . . .<br />In my opinion, Armageddon is worth the rental price, nothing more. The film is miscast, and, as I've said before, the storyline is weak and the character development is almost nonexistent. In my opinion, at least. Rated PG-13. 2 stars out of 5.

0451207521|5.0|It will come as no surprise to anyone that the Allies won World War II or that D-Day - a pivotal event in the war - was executed successfully.  Nonetheless, Ken Follett has written a novel that makes this event suspenseful even though the reader knows what the end result will be.<br />Returning to the era in which Follett's best books take place, Jackdaws follows female operative Felicity \\"Flick\\" Clairet and her efforts to destroy an important German communications center.  She has a plan, and it requires a team of six women.  What she assembles is a motley crew of semi-amateurs, but it is the best she can get.<br />What makes this novel especially stand out is her adversary, the German Major Dieter Franck.  Franck is ruthless, but he is not evil and while a soldier and a German patriot, he is not fond of the Nazis.  Instead, he is out to stop what he considers to be terrorists: the Resistance members who threaten his people.<br />Considering current events, Dieter's motivations have certain parallels to what many believe about terrorism nowadays.  This adds an irony that probably goes beyond Follett even intended considering when this book must have been written and raises interesting questions about what terrorism is and what is appropriate in fighting it.  Which is not to say that Dieter is a good guy, but it does kind of ironically invert some things that are happening nowadays.<br />What is most important, however, is that this is another great book by Follett, an entertaining page-turner that does not let up on the suspense.  For a great WWII spy novel, Follett is hard to beat, and this book is another indication about why this is so.
B000003S1A|5.0|My opinion is that this album is pure genius and a must for anyone interested in progressive alternative music.  This is a unique product influenced by minimalism, new wave and Frippitronics at it's best. \\"The Sheltering Sky\\" alone is worth the price of the album. I would go a step further and say that this is one of the best albums ever made and would be on my top 10 list although this album may be a bit heavy for some listeners.  In truth I like this album more than I listen to it. Every once in a while I'll put it in and marvel at the brilliance.
B000002ITM|5.0|this record seems to be more refined and a lil slower sounding than the past records. which imo are pretty obsolete and raw. something i would have to be in the mood for. im always in the mood for this album. out of all testement albums i have, this is one of my favorite albums besides \\"practice what you preach\\" \\"the new order\\" and the newer ones.

B0000256KE|4.0|\\"For Your Pleasure\\" has often been acclaimed as Roxy's greatest achievement. Having loved [[ASIN:B0000256KM Stranded]] and [[ASIN:B0000256K7 Country Life]], it was natural that I should try \\"For Your Pleasure\\" given the reviews it gets in record guides.<br /><br />However, I cannot admit that \\"For Your Pleasure\\" lived up to the hype that it has often received, and that critical reservations by writers like Robert Christgau are well justified. This was especially true on the slow and dragging \\"In Every Dream Home A Heartache\\" which showed the band being overburdened by Eno's heavy synthesiser experiments, as does, to a lesser degree, \\"Beauty Queen\\", which clearly lacked the magic provided by Eddie Jobson's ecstatic violin melodies.<br /><br />Moreover, one actually notices less eccentricity in the song structures than are observable on the band's first two Jobson-era albums - though the structures are contrasting, it is generally in a very simple manner, as on \\"Strictly Confidential\\". Eno's dense synthesiser experiments often turned into slow-burning drones like those on \\"Sentimental Fool\\" from [[ASIN:B0000256KK Siren]], which were by no means compelling and added almost nothing to the songs, even on rockers like \\"Editions Of You\\". Though \\"Do The Strand\\" was a compelling and driving rocker with Mackay at his most vigorous on saxophone that deserved much of the praise it has been given, on the whole Eno's synthesiser experiments worked best on the three pieces on the second half of the album.<br /><br />\\"The Bogus Man\\" featured Ferry's highest-pitched and dreamiest vocal (in one line he sounds almost like Liz Fraser!) and, whilst it does not stick under the skin, it was more effective than the often-murky first side, especially with Mackay given considerable rein to his saxophone prowess. \\"Grey Lagoons\\", a mixture of three fairly simple verses with the first taste of Ferry's dramatic and feminine vocal style and an extended instrumental jam featuring some very fast piano from Ferry and brilliant saxophone and harmonica, was particularly effective. Curiously, the boxed set \\"The Thrill Of It All\\" includes all the songs here except \\"Grey Lagoons\\".<br /><br />The title tune was a slow ballad that benefitted from the uncluttered arrangements in the chorus so that Ferry's vocal is compelling. It is on this piece that the deeply feminine, mystical side of Roxy that gives them kinship with artists like Laura Nyro, Kate Bush or Jane Siberry is first apparent. Even Eno's synthesisers appeared much more effective in this stately context than they do on earlier songs, and the outro was intensely beautiful with the repeated \\"Tara, Tara\\".<br /><br />Though it contained a number of excellent songs, \\"For Your Pleasure\\" was not Roxy Music's finest work - for that, look to [[ASIN:B0000256KM Stranded]], [[ASIN:B0000256K7 Country Life]] or [[ASIN:B0000256VK Avalon]].iant saxophone and harmonica, was particularly effective.

B000000WA4|5.0|Wow! i have never been a fan of SP until about 3 days ago when by chance i stumbled upon the song \\"Here is No Why.\\" It just caught me off gaurd. I had to download it that second. While i was at it i decided to download a couple of other songs off of this 2 cd set. I picked Bullet Withh Butterfly Wings and Zero. I was hooked. In about 5 minutes i had the entire album downloaded, and i listened to the whole thing loving every second of it. If you like any type of music at all there is a good chance some song on this album will suit you. You want something throaty and heavy, Bullet With Butterfly Wings or zero. Soft and mellow? Well thats when you download Cupid De Locke. Intense techno? Love and 1979 are two great songs. Ths album has it all and thats that.
B0000640VO|5.0|The title character of Amelie is so adorable, you can't help but love her. She is a young woman who takes so much pleasure in helping other people find happiness, she forgets to find a little for herself. Whether she's trying to fix up a co-worker with a regular customer, or defending a shy young man at the grocery store who is picked on by his boss, Amelie is the ultimate do-gooder. She is so cute and sweet, you kind of wish she was YOUR friend. This is a wonderful French film (by far, the best I have ever seen) that will charm the heck out of you. This film had me from the very beginning, when it was showing Amelie as a little girl (wreaking havoc with the neighbor's television reception), right up until the very end where she lived happily ever after. And yes, it is quirky - but not bad quirky. For instance, the scenes where Amelie's father keeps receiving pictures in the mail of his missing garden gnome in various countries, yes it's a little odd - but hilarious. If you're looking for a light, fun film, this is it. Nevermind the subtitles, you may not even need them - you'll be so fixed on the beautiful scenery, and on Audrey Tautou that you may even forget to pay attention to the dialogue. That is the power of this film. Just sit back, relax, and spend some quality time in Amelie's world. It's a great place.
0399103422|5.0|The family Corleone is a family to respect and fear. This book is a book to read and enjoy. I really enjoyed this book from cover to cover. From simple beginnings, Vito Corleone is able to become a man with much power and influence. He runs his family buisness like a well oiled (olive?) machine. All the members of the family come to life in this novel as each do their part to keep the buisness running. Other characters in the book equally come to life as they play parts that inter-weave with the family. This book had me on a kind of rollercoaster with the goings on with the different family members. We get a look at how the young Vito started in the family buisiness all the way up to where Michael the youngest son assumes leadership of the family. Everything in between makes for some of the best reading I've come across in a long time.

B00003CX9Q|5.0|E.T. is a favorite from my childhood along with movies like Goonies, Explorers and Monster Squad. This Limited Edition Collection is a must for Collectors.  They will stop producing it after the new year. An almost flawless transfer gives a bright picture and great colors.  Their is a lot of special features along with the Live performance of John Williams conducting at the 2002 premiere.  I liked the 1982 version better without the new computer animation of ET.  Overall this is one of the better DVD's to come out in the last several months.

B000002KMY|5.0|While it might be heresy to say so, I like Dio Sabbath better than Ozzy Sabbath.  RJDs voice is a better match for Iommi's low, pre-goth guitar than Ozzy's high pitched, nasal offerings.  Dont get me wrong, \\"Paranoid\\" and \\"Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath\\" were terrific achievements, but Sabbath met their true voice on \\"Heaven and Hell.\\"<br />     Speaking of \\"Heaven and Hell,\\"  many have effectively argued that \\"Mob Rules\\" is less consisten, and a slightly less successful rehash of its predacessor.  Be that as it may, \\"Mob Rules\\" is still a superb album and one of the finest examples of heavy metal ever cut.<br />     Like \\"H&H,\\" the disc opens with a fast-paced, straight-ahead heavy metal rocker, \\"Turn up the Night.\\"  \\"Voodoo\\" and \\"The Sign of the Southern Cross\\" get most of the attention, but the fun really starts after the title cut.  <br />     RJD's voice effectively safes \\"Country Girl\\" from being mere filler.  Then comes \\"Slipping Away,\\" where RJD once again turns up the vocal growl among the masterful Iommi Riffing and Geezer Butler's improbable bass line.  Butler is clearly an underrated bassist and metal's finest. Like Iommi's influence on rock/metal guitar to come, Butler elevated the bass beyond mere rhythm instrument.  There would have been no Steve Harris (Iron Maiden)without Geezer first.  After ripping great lines throughout, Iommi and Butler then have a rolicking good time trading scorching leads.  All good, clean fun in a very dark vein.  \\"Falling off the Edge of the World\\" starts with a quiet, slow lament, flows into a heavy gothic riff, then finishes with a full-fledged metal assualt ont he aural senses.  This one alone is worth the price of admission.  Unfortunately these latter cuts, despite being the best, are not available for sample here at amazon.  Take my word for it-- they rule!<br />     Given its admittedly minor weaknesses, I hesitate to give this one 5 stars, but it's simply too good to be left behind with the second tier.  Should you get \\"Heaven and Hell\\" or \\"Mob Rules?\\"  What the hell--get 'em both.  At a mid-range price, they're a steal.
B00005JL3A|4.0|I dont like video games to be turned into movies. However, this is a pretty good movie. (Not to mention Mila Naked) It lacked something along the way, and the super creature zombies [were bad]. The dog zombies were the best part of the film, and its worth watching just to see them, and mila naked. Definately worth watching.
B000069HZP|5.0|I have watched this movie over fifty time. Yes I am a huge fan of movie and more of a fan of great movies.  Upon viewing the film Seven which is a Classic I new that The Game would deliver.  This film takes you on a ride from the top to the bottom.  It's on my top ten list.  My concern is the quality of the DVD. This is one to watch. On buying this movie I would wait.  One of the companies resposible for creating special edition dvd's, hopefully Criterion Collection, will do justice on The Game.  There are several reviews reading negatively about this work of art.  Watch the movie anyway. Three or four people out of one hundred and fifty reviews is a small minority.  Lasty for those who have seen the movie I love how determined and sheltered Micheal Douglas character is.  Some people questioned how real the movie is and how the character believes everything that happens.  It works great but take in to account it is a movie only for entertianment.

I had explored religions and many self-improvements books in the past but really haven't found anything fit into my logic/intuition completely. To me, they are not flawless since religions are mostly man-interpreted. I bought the book few months ago and have been feeling very much liberated.  I am very grateful toward Mr. Tolle, a person who found the path and also so determined to share it with us.  His writing is so clear and genuine and I found my life changed dramatically as I read the book every time.  I bought the CD version after the book and have been listening to it everyday --it is very helpful to remind myself anytime I can to practice my new thought pattern. Along with the book, I started to practice meditation as well. Thank for Tolle, I think I finally found the treasure within and I can see the positive changes happening everyday.  Highly recommend this book!
B00006G8LB|4.0|Good film. The Willem Defoe parts are silly, but overall good. And I always thought Toby MaGuire such a wimpy actor, that I never liked him. But he plays a wimp in this movie--except when using his superpowers--so he's actually well cast
B00006RU5B|2.0|I had high hopes for this one, but was let down big time. I'm a big fan of Rage Against the Machine, particularly Tom Morello's songwriting and playing. I should note that I like RATM for the music--though I may sometimes agree with the politics, it was always about the music for me.<br />Audioslave contains some familiar RATM tones, but this album is all about Chris Cornell, who I'm not particularly fond of. His voice is overpowering and strained, like he's constantly in pain. But while you'd think that pain and rage would go together, all I got was pain and rage that this could have--and SHOULD have--been so much better.<br />I agree with another reviewer that after multiple listenings, I can't remember which song is which. It's like a soundtrack for a Michael Bay movie--the movie is lame, but there's so much action, you can't really pay attention to the music.<br />Art is art, and artists should be free to do what they want and are not slaves of their fans. Is the band and album's name a commentary on this? I don't know, but I hope the next album is a little more creative and exciting.

B000005ITX|2.0|Sometimes there really is a good reason why an album remains in relative obscurity. But these days, FOREVER CHANGES gets more than its share of attention thanks to some obviously burned-out hippies that have become music critics. <br />This album does sound dated, stuck in the sixties like the Monkees. There is a weirdness to it which includes flamenco-style guitar and lyrics like \\"Oh the snot has caked against my pants/It has turned into crystal\\" (whatever floats yer boat), but most of it borders on ATONALITY as well as notes and chord progressions that simply DO NOT WORK. These characteristics make for an uncomfortable listen, but maybe I'd feel differently ON ACID.

0066214122|2.0|This begins in dramatic fashion and immediately hooked me on suspicion alone:  What was happening to this family!? To this man's wife!?  As the tale unfolded, it did keep its grip until the husband takes on a consulting job with his wife's employer. The job was taken reluctantly (past bad-blood), but allowed the husband an attempt to get to the bottom of his wife's strange behavior at home. What follows is a decline into nano-talk and technical babble that severely overshadowed what could have been a gripping drama to the last page. Some of the reasoning/explanation of the swarm behavior and other science-induced narrative made my mind wander off the story,with a hope that a reasonable, believable drama would return in the latter chapters. It didn't happen. <BR>Too many books, too little time. When is the next Nelson DeMille novel arriving?
B00005JLRR|2.0|The ST \\"even-odd\\" rule, if you haven't heard of it, says the odd movies really stink and the even ones are good (and sometime have been really good--remember Wrath of Kahn, IV, and First Contact?).  Anyway, as an even one, I had high hopes for Nemesis, but (sigh)....<br />I'm a big STNG fan, but I had issues w/ this film...  Roger Ebert expresses it really really well, so I won't do you the disservice by fumbling with something already well put. <br />--- snip --- <br />There might have been a time when the command deck of Starship Enterprise looked exciting and futuristic, but these days it looks like a communications center for security guards. Starships rocket at light speeds halfway across the universe, but when they get into battles the effect is roughly the same as on board a World War II bomber. Fearsome death rays strike the Enterprise, and what happens? Sparks fly out from the ceiling and the crew gets bounced around in their seats like passengers on the No. 36 bus. This far in the future they wouldn't have sparks because they wouldn't have electricity, because in a world where you can beam matter--beam it, mind you--from here to there, power obviously no longer lives in the wall and travels through wires.<br />...<br />I tried to focus on the actors. Patrick Stewart, as Capt. Picard, is a wonderful actor. I know because I have seen him elsewhere. It is always said of Stewart that his strength as an actor is his ability to deliver bad dialogue with utter conviction. I say it is time to stop encouraging him. Here's an idea: Instead of giving him bad dialogue, why not give him good dialogue, and see what he can do with that? Here is a man who has played Shakespeare.<BR>...<br />There is a scene in the movie in which one starship rams another one. You would think this would destroy them both, and there are a lot of sparks and everybody has to hold onto their seats, but the \\"Star Trek\\" world involves physical laws which reflect only the needs of the plot. If one ship rammed another and they were both destroyed and everyone died, and the movie ended with a lot of junk floating around in space, imagine the faces of the people in the audience.<br />I think it is time for \\"Star Trek\\" to make a mighty leap forward another 1,000 years into the future, to a time when starships do not look like rides in a 1970s amusement arcade, when aliens do not look like humans with funny foreheads, and when wonder, astonishment and literacy are permitted back into the series. Star Trek was kind of terrific once, but now it is a copy of a copy of a copy.<br />--- snip ---<br />I encourage you to check out other reviews Ebert's authored... They're typically really brilliant and add to the entire film experience.
B00005U2JL|4.0|The god of lyrics is back! With his unique, strange way, M.M. gives us a great show of rock music! It is not only the show, the songs that make it great but also the 30-minute documentary that shows what it is like to be backstage at such a concert! Since we learn more about Marilyn Manson in general I would suggest it not only to M.M. fans but also others! A great DVD that when combined with surround gives you the impression that you are in the concert! Great!

0446608955|4.0|The story, &quot;A Walk to Remember,&quot; is about two young adults, who are brought together and fall in love. I think that this book is very good, and the audience this book applies to is varied. Anyone can enjoy this book, and get something out of it, or relate to it in some way. It shows people how a first love feels, and how love can change anyone. The theme of this story I think is to live every day as if it were your last, and never pass up the chance to tell someone you love him/her. The plot in this story is very traditional love story. Two people fall and love, spend every waking minute with each other, and realize that they are meant to be together, but the difference in this story is that in the end it is impossible for them to be together. Landon Carter falls in love with Jamie Sullivan, unexpectedly, and realizes that she is the one. He is heart broken to find that Jamie is terminally ill. I think this whole problem makes there last few months together more valuable. This book definitely stirred my emotions, it made me really think. It made me realize that there is someone out there for everyone. And when you find the person you love, you will do anything to make them happy.  I recommend this book to anyone who's in for a little crying, laughing, and smiling. It is a quick book to read, but every bit of it is enjoyable.
B00000K2W1|5.0|I am not a teen, but I wasn't alive when Janis died. Like Hendrix, Coltrane, Mingus or Bird, the experience of seeing her live is something I never had, never will. But for those present at any of her shows, it must have been an exhilarating experience, to say the least.  I get chills down my spine on almost every song here. From the soulful screams of &quot;Try(Just a little bit harder)&quot;, to her really raspy yet whispery delivery on the classic &quot;Summertime,&quot; Janis's voice seemed to channel profound emotions right into your soul. The musicians are also very innovative and solid, be it pure psychedelia (Big Brother) or horn laden R&amp;B (Kozmic Blues). Yes, she got caught up in the climate of the times and died way too son. Nonetheless, we were lucky to have such rare talent among us. No one since has equalled the power, the raw and piercing emotion of Janis Joplin.

You have to get this... It is the best season, besides season three... When is Season Three coming out On Dvd. Anyway for any true Friends fan buy the complete second season.
0446677450|4.0|I enjoyed the book. It is helpful for young people and adults. It shows you how you need to use your money wisely so that  you'll have greater opportunities in life. It also shows you how you can select stocks the right way, so that you'll make more money. I recomend this book to everyone because it's a good book and it has great information for the future.
B000002A6M|4.0|Just a word for the rap/rock, rap/metal kids of today: Even though it wasn't entirely Aerosmith's idea to fuse rap with rock (I think producer Rick Rubin first suggested it to Run DMC),Aeorismith's willingness, open-mindedness and fearlessnes is what brought these two genres together for the first time. Also, the kind of material (in retrospect) was very appropriate for it - the attitude, the swagger, the groove of \\"Walk this way\\" fit like a glove with the rapping of the Run guys. Therefore, all rap/metal kids, when they put on a Kid Rock, or Limp (lame), or Rage, or Papa Roach cd ARE PAYING HOMAGE TO THE ORIGINATORS: Aerosmith and Run DMC. Whether they know it or not, or whether they choose to deny it, they are paying tribute to them by being fans of this kind of music. Word.
0553260111|2.0|The doctor who finds Bourne is shown as a drunk but seems quite intelligent when you pick up his comments to Bourne. It didn't add up. <br />I just didn't find the female character all that believable.  She seemed too easy to jump into a love story and deny all of her other existence.<br />Last, Carlos flew to the US the same time are Bourne did in the end. Why didn't anyone mention looking on the plane rosters that morning.<br />Carlos  who is said to be a well known face rushes past dozens of people, though one entry and no one says a word or looks at him<br />Gunfire in a house and no one calls the police.<br />Just plain weak.
B00005OM4N|3.0|personally i think this album is degrading to ms. spears. on 95% of the tracks you can hardly hear her voice at all becasue of all the computerized junk that has been done to it. on her first album she had an okay voice, she sounded like most of the girls i know who can carry a tune alright. but she doesnt even allow herself that anymore. the songs on this cd have a good beat, aand are nice for dances and clubs, but over all, theyre still pop-y sugary sweet songs for the under 12 crowd. if she thinks she being innovative, shes not. if she thinks shes \\"reinventing\\" herself, shes not. this album is just lik her other 2, but with more drums and purring.
B00005221M|2.0|If you can still find the VHS version , get it. The DVD is missing a few key moments that were in the original theatrical release and the video.The Disc is ok, but why add some scenes and delete others? This Is DVD!! Put it all on there!!
B000002L9J|4.0|\\"The Queen is Dead\\" ranks as one of the finer Smiths recordings. It's lusher, denser and more baroque than either \\"Meat is Murder\\" or their self-titled debut album, but it retains Morrissey's uniquely melancholy view of life. His lettucehead laments are wonderfully undercut by Johnny Marr's jazzy, jangly guitar riffs (I think he outranks U-2's The Edge for sonic impression) and the band never sounded tighter. This is a collection of tunes to accompany a walk in the moss, dressed up like Oscar Wilde, and throwing one's velvet-gloved hand over one's head in mock-despair - and it's great fun if you understand Morrissey's dark humor.<br />The songs range from rollicking (\\"The Queen is Dead,\\" \\"Bigmouth Strikes Again\\") to mopey (\\"Never Had No One Ever\\") to hopeful (\\"There is a Light That Never Goes Out\\") and all manner of navel-gazing themes. The imagery is rich: being buried alive (\\"I Know It's Over), naughty clergy (\\"Vicar in a Tutu\\"), and weathered tombstones (\\"Cemetry Gates\\"). In short, all the things that Morrissey loves best. His oft-times unsettling vocal makes the lyrics more personal than political, while Marr's deft chords prune the excess sentimentality. <br />Musically, The Smiths could rock out (listen to Mike Joyce's strong drumming in particular) and they could change from ballad to rockabilly on a dime. Although much of their magic was due to Morrissey's black-curtained self-pity, the band was unique for its day - only equaled by groups like The Cure. \\"The Queen is Dead\\" is a high point for The Smiths.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I recently married an Apache gun ship pilot that has been attached to 3 Battalion of the 101 Airborne for 8 years.  Many of his friends were part of Operation Anaconda in Afganistan.<BR>Although this series documents the beginning of the 101st, it makes it very clear that no matter where the ... is going on, the 101st are there, taking care of business.<BR>Even to someone with no prior exposure, other than TV and news regarding the military, like me - this series really opened my eyes to what our troops go through for us.  And generally for no recognition or appreciation what so ever.<BR>What Spielburg and Hanks manage to capture on film is very much real.  These are true to life conditions,  and one should take the time to reflect on each segment - this is NOT entertainment - it is real.
B000001ESF|4.0|The ineresing thing here is the fact that this album is heavy, extremely heavy, even being labeled as a progressive-rock album. It´s progressive in its conception, but the guys plays with energy, even in the soft moments like LESSONS.<br />I just love this album, I´m not a rush total fan, but I own a lot of their albums, and give credit to where credit is due: these guys are genius. <br />I recently watched them live in São Paulo, Brazil (November 22, 2002), in front of 65,000 people (never befor they had played to such a huge crowd. Fortunately, I was right at the front of the stage (after paying a HUGE amount of money to do so...)and I could enjoy all their marvellous technique at close hand.
B000003Z6I|5.0|This CD is so good that I am going to give it 5 stars even though the cover of Elvis' In the Ghetto is weak.  The problem is that the lyrics of this song sound pretty lame compared to Nick's fantastical poetry. I don't think he really believed in it himself.  That being said, I love this CD. It still, of course, bears heavy traces of Birthday Party, but what is wrong with that. I ask you: Does ANYONE rock as hard as Nick Cave? Of course, if you are reading this, you are a fan who has come to add his or her positive review as homage to the Man. Fact: Birthday Party/Nick Cave and the Seeds make the late sixties Stones (circa Jumpin Jack Flash, Gimme Shelter, etc.) look like a bunch of wimps.  Am I right or what?
B000002B7M|5.0|Contrary to the recent fake reissue, this is the REAL BLIZZARD OF OZZ.<br />This masterpiece has all the lyrics (and a lot of mthe music)written by Bob Daisley, all riffs written by Randy RHoads, while Ozzy contributed some of the vocals lines and melodies. A total team effort. This would be a band really called BLIZZARD OF OZZ, but everybody involved agreed that Ozzy was the selling point.<br />If you still don´t know this one, go for it.
0571063896|5.0|This is the book that got me seriously started with card magic, and I still learn something every time I pick it up.<BR>     It teaches the basics of card magic: shuffles, palming, the pass, glimpses, etc.  But more importantly, it covers the real secret of magic: how to entertain and amaze.  There is more to a card trick than meets the eye, and this book covers those things.<BR>     Each chapter teaches a sleight (or sleights) or a principle of magic, and then a trick (or tricks) utilizing that sleight.  <BR>     I still use some of the tricks from this book in my performances.  The tricks taught are all excellent and absolute stunners in the right hands.<BR>     Besides the general chapters, there are two chapters on flourishes, one on routining an act, and one on platform tricks. <BR>     I highly recommend this book to all students of magic.  It is a classic, and an excellent choice for the beginner.  Even if you are an expert, you should own this book, as it will enrich you as a magician.<BR>     The Royal Road to Card Magic is one of my favorite books in my magic library.
B00005QDW1|4.0|Rock Steady starts out as kinda a high paced fun fest (Hell good and Hey Baby) then slows down around Track 6. Gwen's still on the love tip for the most part so if your not the mushy type forgetaboutit!! One of the highlights of this CD has to be Waiting Room. Prince or the symbol dude helps Gwen out with vocal and its a really jazzy/funk song... i loved this cd and the only reason it doesnt get a 5 is the overuse of this god i know what type of effect it is but it sounds like one of those old school video games...annoying well anyway its a good cd and you should pick it up
B000066NW0|5.0|I don't care what anyone says...I love this album! I recommend this album to anyone who loves real words with real emotion. I can't pick just one song that I like the best because they are all equally great. I put this cd in my cd player it picks me up and makes me want to sing along at the top of my lungs.
0812513495|5.0|Enders Game is probly the best book I have ever read. The book is filled with action feeling and a great plot. The main character of this book Ender Wiggens is a great. He is a genious, little kid, yet more powerful then someone twice his size. The book has lots of amazing characters. My favorit character was Alai and Graff. All the caracters add a differnt part to the book and with out them the book would not be complete. Even though I did not like Peter, with out him there would be no major confflict. So i recomend this book to every one no matter what your age is you will love this book!
B00005JL96|2.0|Yes, I was saddened by the first scenes.  Lilo fights with her<BR>friends instead of talking things out.  Her relationship with her sister is scary too.  There are too many &quot;nice&quot; movies out there.  Don't waste your money.  Buy a traditional family movie.<BR>Disney please go back to good family values.
B00005JKCH|4.0|This movie is great! The acting in it is fantastic and the effects of Spider Man swinging through the city are amazing. The Green Goblin is the only let down. He looks more like a plastic toy than a real villian in the movie. But overall, it's well worth being bought!
0812550706|4.0|I read this book for a project for school. At first I thought I wasn't going to like it, but as i read more and more I found myself becoming engrossed in the book. We had two weeks to finish it, but I had it done in two days. The book had a unique plot and great character development. I found it easy to picture myself right next to Ender, experiencing what he was going through. Some people found it hard to believe that a six year-old would talk the way Ender did, but they forget that he is smarter than the average child that age. Overall, it was a great book, I highly reccomend it, and I can't wait to read the rest of the books in the series.
B00006F7S4|3.0|Three and a half, to be exact.  Three and three quarters.  Just because i'm a hard grader.<br />Since when was sounding like the greats of the past a bad thing?  Millions of us would sell our souls to the devil to make music that sounded anywhere near Nick Drake, or the Beatles, or whoever else people say this album sounds like.  (Although Round the Bend does seem like it belongs over the top of River Man on Nick Drake's Five Leaves Left.)  Beck has a talent for every type of music, and this album showcases one of these areas.  Sea Change is yet another classic from another classic artist.  Yes, artist.<br />Whoever says this album is boring or uncreative is not listening closely enough to the songs.  The celestial background seascapes on songs like Lost Cause, Lonesome Tears, and others give the 60s and 70s an incredible modern twist that only beck could think of.  It is truly incredible the little things Beck adds to his music to make it unlike anything else.  The string arrangements, like in Paper Tiger, are incredible, as well.  How he gels electic bleeps and whizzes and strings so completely with his ever-interesting bass lines and vocals will forever amaze me.  Sea Change is a perfect example for all these things.<br />For those who say this album is one big block of sad, you may be right.  But have you ever heard such heartfelt, focused, beautiful, intriguing sadness in all your life?  Yes, i'll admit, you probably won't want to listen to this CD on your way to your wedding, or on the car ride to Disney World, but that doesn't mean its a bad album.  Its just means you have to be ready for it.<br />Although not as free as Stereopathic Soulmanure or Mutations, Sea Change holds great value in my eyes from its sheer musical beauty.
B00006CXSS|5.0|After seeing Saving Private Ryan a few years ago I ran out to recommended it to everyone I know. Now I would do the same for BOB with much more enthusiasm.<br />More than just a war movie, this film demonstrates how ordinary people set out to do some extraordinary things, even in the most onimous conditions. It's a celebration of humanity in general. The production is excellent, it has the same 40% reduction in color saturation as SPR, and same ggod sound quality, which added to the experience tremendously. Surprisingly, the performance were also great across the board with these no-name actors, I envision some of them future movie stars. Oh, even without a single actress in this film, all of my female friends loved it.<br />Garbages like \\"Pearl Harbor\\" and \\"Windtalkers\\" completely destroyed those film-worth materials, that just churns my stomach. Now if they can have Spielberg & Hanks redo the PH, or some other Pacific Theater saga, and keep Michael Bay out of it....
B000002U8A|3.0|Of the 3 Duran Duran albums with the original line-up, this is the one I would not recommend. Simon LeBon's vocals have gone from the confident crooning of the past to high-pitched yelps.  The lyrics, although brilliant in places, (\\"catch me with you fizzy smile\\", \\"saw your heart turn spade this orchid's turned to black\\") are often unbearably cliche (\\"caught in the crossfire and it ain't no wind of change\\", \\"you belong to the hands of the night\\").  Andy Taylor's guitar licks are particularly corny here too, like bad hair-metal, especially on 'Of Crime and Passion' and 'Shadows on Your Side\\".  All that said, it's still a fun listen if you're a fan.  Fun that is, until the last few songs.  The end of  `Shadows on Your Side' is haunting (unfortunately, it too suffers from the aforementioned problems of whiny singing and inappropriate guitar work).  'Tiger Tiger' is a gorgeous instrumental.  'The Seventh Stranger' is heart-wrenchingly beautiful and is suavely delivered.  John Taylor's bass goes all rubbery and fretless for these final two.  Maybe they dragged Japan's Mick Karn into the studio and didn't tell anyone.  <br />Speaking of that great under-recognized British synth-pop outfit, Japan, has anyone ever noticed the striking parallel between these two groups?  It always appeared to me that Duran Duran was always one step BEHIND Japan musically and stylistically.  Album by album, you can see the conscious following of footsteps:<br />Japan-Quiet Life (1979) / Duran Duran S/T (1981) ... stark synth-disco<BR>Japan-Gentlemen Take Polaroids (1980) /Duran Duran-Rio (1982) ... slick Euro-pop<BR>Japan-Tin Drum (1981)/Duran Duran-Seven and the Ragged Tiger (1983) ... ethnic experimentation<br />Just compare band photos from each period and you can tell from that alone.  Ahh, but what Japan originated Duran Duran perfected and SOLD!  Plus, Duran Duran were better looking!!!  And isn't that what really matters here?  Style over susbstance?  NO!  Duran Duran put out some great albums.  Seven and the Ragged Tiger just isn't one of them.  Buy the first one and Rio and get to know the true heirs to the Roxy Music throne of glamour and over-the-top greatness.
B00003CXCW|4.0|\\"There's nothing tragic about being 50,\\" gigolo Joe Gillis tells the freshly face-lifted Norma Desmond in \\"Sunset Blvd.\\" For once, Gillis gets it right. Certainly nothing wrong with being 50 if you happen to look as good as Paramount's restored version of Billy Wilder's creepy Hollywood classic.<br />Filmed on unstable silver nitrate, the 1950 \\"Sunset\\" no longer existed as printed when Paramount decided to revive the black comedy for its archives and this new DVD \\"Special Collector's Edition.\\" The movie so closely identified with the studio survived only as flawed acetate copies of the original internegative. They were converted to digital at 2,000 lines -- a resolution double that of high definition. Restoration specialists went through the film frame by frame, buffing out scratches and removing the dirt. After several years' work, the results were transferred back to 35mm prints, and DVD. (\\"Roman Holiday\\" had a similar rescue, and these restoration efforts are detailed on that DVD but not on \\"Sunset.\\")<br />Like tarnished star Norma, who can't be expected to play 25, the rescued \\"Sunset Blvd.\\" images have their ups and downs, but their inner beauty can't be denied. Purists can quibble over the homogenized digital video -- the amount of grain, lack of resolution and shimmering -- but the rest of us will be too busy savoring this tale of bad craziness in the Hollywood Hills. The film is presented full frame (1.33:1), as Wilder shot it. Sound is mono -- mostly OK, sometimes darn good. Dialogue is crystal clear.<br />Ed Sikov, author of  \\"On Sunset Boulevard: The Life and Times of Billy Wilder,\\" does the feature commentary with a chatty, often awkward tone that will put off some Students of Film. He's clearly reading from notes.<br />But Sikov has the film down cold and views it with a great eye -- check out his description of Norma (Gloria Swanson) as a claw-handed Nosferatu in the shot at 20:45. (This is \\"a monster movie at times,\\" Sikov notes.) Or how he calls attention to former silent actress Norma disdainfully brushing away a boom mike that ruffles her feather during the visit to Stage 18.<br />Of particular interest to \\"Sunset\\" buffs will be the re-creation of the original opening that was laughed out of theaters by heartland preview audiences. Silent clips accompany script excerpts in which Joe's body visits the L.A. morgue and makes chat with the local stiffs.ntion to former silent actress Norma disdainfully brushing away a boom mike that ruffles her feather during the visit to Stage 18.<br />Of particular interest to \\"Sunset\\" buffs will be the re-creation of the original opening that was laughed out of theaters by heartland preview audiences.

B00000JLWW|1.0|Though I can understand why this film appealed to so many and I can even applaud its technical merits, I am still bewildered at those who claim it is \\"one of the greatest films of all time.\\" Just as bewildering is the fact that it won so many Academy Awards and even beat out \\"L.A. Confidential,\\" quite possibly the best film on the '90's, for the Best Picture award.<br />What you have hear is a film that capitalizes on a tragic disaster, with a script that caters to lovesick teenagers.  Put Leonardo di Caprio in the lead role and you've got more than your fairshare of lovesick girls stomping over one another to see this film over and over.  And guys get to see Kate Winslet's bare breasts....(one of the few parts of the film I enjoyed).<br />Artistically and technically, it is a spectacle..I'll give it that! And Billy Zane, as the \\"evil\\" side of the love triangle is excellent.  But the script is so by the numbers and routine!<br />It's simple- poor but handsome and talented boy meets wealthy, rebellious, sexy socialite girl.  PRoblem is, she's engaged. And, of course, she doesn't want to be!  One thing leads to another, they get to know eachother, and she loses her virginity in the backseat of a car (how many times have we seen this?).  Fiancee gets wind of it, gets angry, tries to kill the young man. An iceberg beats him to it. Boy saves girl, sacrifices his own life. She lives to a ripe old age and never forgets him.<br />See what I mean? THIS won dozens of awards and the praise of critics worldwide? I can't help but scratch my head at this.  Have moviegoing audiences become so conditioned to accept rubbish and think its amazing?<br />If you are in the mood for a 3 hour, mindless, overly-sentimental spectacle, then this is the film for you....If not, do yourself a favor and pass!
B000005QH3|5.0|BUY THIS MOVIE NOW !!!<BR>IF YOU NEED FURTHER COAXING, THEN READ ON.<BR>First of all lets put all the downsides to the movie aside. There are not enough to mention. All you critics who have that shallow spectrum of view, step off. Ya know the ones who say film quality could have been better, music could have been more mainstream etc etc. Or the best one from one of Amazon's own (Sean Axmaker)\\"it really does'nt make much sense\\". Please spare all of us your views on what an American Hero is or what criteria he or she has to meet to be one. WE KNOW. Be you the Blue Collar Gearhead or appreciative Internet Guru or CEO. Anyone can follow this movie and understand who Kowalski is, what he stands for, why he chose to do what he is doing in present character form, and why or why not he may or may not have taken his own life in the end. As all of us are seperate of mind and soul, we may draw our own conclusions. Gee I can't recall a movie with a more elementary outline of showing a characters bio than this one. I have seen alot of movies folks and I don't usually go out of my way to affirm the quality of a film. But some just don't need to be criticized. Here is some healthy advice for anyone who has viewed or intends to view this movie in the future. After watching this film, if you don't get it, then please start seeking psychiatric help. I cannot offer anymore in the area of temptation for you to buy this film. Although I can guarantee that you have nothing to lose in purchasing it. For if you don't like it, someone that you know will. So in a sense, you have nothing to lose.
B00003CXAE|1.0|No! GREASE is not the word!! This movie is one of the worst musicals ever made.  SINGIN IN THE RAIN, and WEST SIDE STORY...Now those are musicals!! The characters look too old for their parts. Olivia Newton John and Stockard Channing look like bimbos and Travolta and Conaway look like hoodlums. They don't look like...high schoolers?  Some of the songs are catchy (Summer Nights, and Grease Lightning) but the movie is badly directed and the song and dance numbers are really bush league! All the characters are meanspirited, annoying and should be in an old peoples home and not going to Rydell High .  Lastly, the acting is all terrible.  Skip this movie and put on AN AMERICAN IN PARIS or ON THE TOWN or any other musical besides this piece of [garbage].
B00000K19E|5.0|The one who hasn't seen The Matrix?  Well do yourself a favor and buy one of the best science fiction films of all time.  This is a definite BUY recommendation.  It's one of my favorite films.<br />I saw this the first time in a sparsely occupied theatre.  And it really was a random pick at the dollar show, because I hadn't heard anything about it during its first release at the larger theatres.  When the film was over, I was in awe.  It was probably the coolest things I had ever seen on screen.  I was blown away.  How many films (in your lifetime, even) do that to you???  <br />To try to explain the story would be too difficult and confusing here.  Let me just say that it's set in the future and machines and software are ruling the earth.  Now, what does that tell you?  Not much, huh?  Even to the people in The Matrix, they had to experience it to get an understanding of it.  And even then...<br />Keannu Reeves is perfect for this role.  His cool attitude really fits the character.  Hugo Weaving is great as Agent Smith.  Really, the whole cast is good.  <br />The cinematography, colors, costumes, sets, and special effects are great.  And there's loads of special effects.  Some of which have been copied ad nauseum since its release.  It's fast-paced, engrossing, and intellectual.  That's pretty rare.  <br />It was directed by the Wachowski brothers.  They also directed Bound, another under-rated film.  Although the transition to The Matrix was pretty phenomenal.  I can't imagine how they'll top this with the sequel.  A major reason why this was so awesome was that it was so original.<br />Granted, seeing it on the big screen and seeing it on your tv is a big difference, but nowhere near worth downgrading it.  It's still an awesome.  And the DVD is loaded with interesting extras.  Buy it.
038533348X|5.0|Cat's Cradle by Kurt Vonnegut is by far one of the greatest novels of the 20th century. Vonnegut brings this fictional story to life with great detail at every turn. From the creation of ice nine to Bokonism, Vonnegut weaves a complex but entirely believable story. The novel begins with the main character John who is writing a book on the day the bomb was dropped on Hiroshima called The Day the World Ended. His writing this book leads him to his destiny as he travels to the laboratory where the bomb was created and then to San Lorenzo where he becomes president. San Lorenzo's founder, Bokonon, created a religion for the people. This is an average idea except for the fact that Bokonism seems uncannily real, with it's own terms and practices all created by Vonnegut. This novel is a masterpiece.<br />Cat's Cradle is fast passed, deeply detailed, and very interesting. The novel is very ironic and a must read for everyone. Kurt Vonnegut weaves a great story that never lets you down. Through its outlandish turns and twists Vonnegut makes it seem so very real. This novel is definitely a 5 out of 5.
B00004VW35|3.0|This is for Neil Young fans and country music (not the lousy modern country-rock) fans who may like Neil Young.  He collaborates with Willie Nelson and Waylon Jennings on a few songs, so that should tell you something about the recording.  This is pretty good light country music to listen to.  It's not spectacular, in my opinion, but good stuff.  I recommend purchasing only to fans with a real interest in this type of music.
B00005B5L4|5.0|On every track you'll hear many new sounds and instruments that were buried in the two channel mix.  The difference is as huge as going from a mono mix to stereo.  Absolutely fantastic.
B00006J9OV|4.0|There is a lot about this DVD that I love, from the opening footage of Lincoln Center to the ascension of the chandeliers, the stage settings, the extraordinarily convincing acting, the wonderfully clear sound. However, Levine, perhaps seeking to emulate Hans Knappertsbusch in choice of a \\"langsam\\" tempo, actually comes off in the opening prelude and several times throughout as sounding as though he has lost his place. Where Kna would draw out the essence, the twilight, the mystique inherent in the mysticism in this wonderful opera, Levine's mob seems to just stop at points. And maybe it's me, but on video, he looks down at the score, so maybe, just maybe, he did forget. Maybe it's a cultural thing. New York tends to overwhelm whatever it does, that sometimes the more subtle and fragile essences are lost.<br />That should send most New Yorkers into a frenzy. Anyway, Parsifal had its first performance outside of Bayreuth in NY with the Met, so the return in 1993 was a return effected with an homage to, though not a replication of, the directions the composer had issued for the production. The scenery is great. As you watch the singers perform, they inhabit their roles with conviction. Lighting is dramatic. In fact the whole experience is very much one of great wonder and joy to be part of. On DVD, it sparkles!<br />I am likely ruined by Kna's 1962 performance, made in the certain knowledge that he was dying himself. On CD, that is the performance to own. You will feel your heart being pulled from your chest. The essence of the philosophical issues and the human questions presented in the music and text were cleared and presented by an artist as iconclastic, independent and as visionary as anyone to ever take up the baton. The orchestra and the singers knew the drama on the page and from the podium and played and sang as I've never heard in any other production.<br />How could NY hope to match that? You would have to be German and would have to have lived in Kna's soul. All the same, this is a remarkable document of a work that asked so many questions about the nature of one's heart and soul. I enjoyed this enormously and would think that all lovers of this opera will find elements to embrace passionately in this production.
B000006PYU|4.0|An excellent return from a welcome old friend. Riveting &amp; gut wrenchingly beautiful, simple, sraightforward blues with a feeling. A guitarist and bluesman who certainly still belongs in the same class as his bretheren Kim Simmonds and Eric Claptin. I enjoy this very much and listen to it frequently with growing appreciation.
B00006NSZ5|3.0|(...) all the D-12 and Eminem (...)(don't get me wrong, hes a great rapper and lyricist)this is 50 Cents time to shine. \\"Wanksta\\" is the best rap single to be released in a long time.  His flow is slow and matches perfectly with shady's beats.  Not only can he flow but this cat can write.  He raps with an attitude and will take over the rap game in the years to come (time for Em to step out and let 50 enter).  So purchasing this album for (...)$ is well worth it...just for the 3 songs featuring 50.<BR>...<br />... <br />...
B000001FA4|4.0|Reading reviews on this album I find that this one gets underated.  Granted, it my not have been the album fans were hoping to get at the time, that came 3 years later, but it's still good.  The emotion on this album is deep.  I think Edge's most hauntingly beautiful guitar work can be found here.  SONGS: A Sort of Homecoming, Pride, The Unforgettable Fire, Promenade, Bad, &amp; MLK.
B00006RU5B|5.0|I believe the new Audioslave cd is incredible.  However, based on other reviews which i've observed, too many Rage Against The Machine and Soundgarden fans were expecting this cd to be one of the two.  Realize, that although these bands are joined, they still formed to make a new one.  Therefore, it's going to be different, which i beleive was the main and comprehensible goal.  This is a wonderful cd from begining to end and i highly recommend it.
B00000JCOV|5.0|This goes out to all you KoRn,Limp Bizkit,P.O.D,System Of A down,Linkin Park park fans out there.it appears that slipknots first album (Slipknot) has the heavy fast metal fiffs and also very fast rapping styles....Well actually i think this one's better than IOWA..
B00005JLF5|5.0|What can I say about DS9?  DS9 was the best star trek series in my humble opinion.  The series had symetry:  when you saw it in it's totality you could discern a beginning, a middle and an end.  That is kind of hard to find in other trek series.  In other trek series its all about space missions and there is less continuity in the series as a whole.  I'm not saying there bad their just on the second tier compared to DS9.  DS9 was open to story arcs that other trek series didn't touch:  politics, war, and religion.  How different peoples build trust and survive together.  Plus its just fun to watch.
B00000JLWW|1.0|This was a terrible movie. I've seen it done before (West Side Story). All it was, was a reason to get Leonardo DiCaprio in the spotlight. This movie never should have been made. NEVER SHOULD HAVE WON BEST PICTURE. I saw many movies from that year that deserved best picture, and this wasn't one of them. This movie was horrible. I wasted 3 hours of my life watching this movie. I laughed when Leo died. <BR>  What the hell was James Cameron thinking? Stick to action, that is what you are good at. I must agree with T.V. guide:<BR>   \\"This DVD proves that James Cameron kicked ( it ) pre-TITANIC.\\"<BR>            -T.V. Guide<BR>             Refering to the Terminator DVD
B0000041LO|5.0|I found this box-set incidentally. I have not hear any of the Haydn Piano Trios before the purchase. Once I begin to play the Disc 1, I was unable to stop the music playing as I love it so much. I completed the entire cycle (9 CDs) in 2 days, over the weekend!<br />Definitely a 5-stars recording! I regretted why I did not come to notice it earlier...All these beautiful music are going to keep me accompany for many years to come. <br />Only complaint - One small little box to contain 9 CDs is indeed a little miserable, and I cannot even close the box after removing the plastic wrapping...!!! :-)
B00005JLRR|5.0|I read a review that said this was a clone of Wrath of Kahn. I must disagree.  I think it is purposefully meant to mirror Kahn. There are many parallels, but I believe that Nemesis stands by itself.  I don't know if there will be any more TNG movies, but this one felt like it was an ending.  The one thing that impressed me was the level of emotion in this film. At first, I felt a sad nastalgia as the characters met for a wedding, then I felt nervous as the characters meet the villain. Next came excitement as the action picked up.  By the end, I was actually squirming in my seat from the tension.  I have never seen a Star Trek movie that has struck my emotions like this. I say bravo to the Star Trek franchise. I hope there are more TNG movies.<BR>PS (Do you think we'll ever see movies from the \\"Enterprise\\" crew?)
B000002C1V|5.0|I think the music on this album is every bit as good as the lyrics.  (In fact, I'd say that this is the best use of an orchestra on a 'rock-and-roll' record ever--except that this isn't a rock-and-roll' record...)<br />And maybe that's where the confusion lies.  There are some great rock 'moments' on the album ('Your Possible Pasts) and--in 'Not Now John'--a pretty good rock-and-roll song (or two)--but overall, this emotions on this album simply aren't suited to rock songs, or to 'rock-and-roll'.<br />Waters whispers more than half the lyrics, and other than the two aforementioned songs, the intermittent and unexpected percussive hits from the orchestra only accentuate the alienation and the resulting paranoia that are the themes of this album.  This album is about stillness; quiet sadness. <br />If you come to this album ready to have it adjust your mood to something like you felt during 'Run Like Hell' or 'Another Brick in the Wall Part 2', then you cannot help but be disappointed--but you've missed the point.<br />But, if you found that album's focus on the dangers of rock-and-roll stardom more than a bit juvenile, then you will find this a welcome change, a more mature--and thus more timeless--album.<br />(As for the comment that there were no radio cuts from this, I remember hearing 'Your Possible Pasts' AND (a massively edited version of) 'Not Now John' in medium rotation on FM radio, way back in 1983.)<br />Keith Russell.
0312979479|5.0|This is an excellent book. There is only one slight problem - the author never intended to call it &quot;And then there were none&quot; or &quot;10 little Indians&quot;. For the sake of political correctness one tries to rewrite history.
0066620996|5.0|Twenty-one researchers looked for public companies with the following patters: Fortune 500 Companies with fifteen-year cumulative stock returns at or below the general stock market, a transition period followed by cumulative returns at least three times the general market over the next fifteen years.<br />Eleven companies were identified and compared to similar companies within industry that had not transitioned from good to great.  For example, Abbott was compared with Upjohn; Circuit City with Silo; Gillette with Warner-Lambert, Kroger with A&P, etc.<br />The project involved coding 6,000 articles, 2,000 pages of interview transcripts, and 384Million bytes of computer data.<br />What was learned?<br />Since THE key role of the Board of the hiring and firing of the CEO, we will focus on this area only.  But the book has lots of strategic implications for Board members and senior executives beyond CEO recruiting.<br />Boards of public companies often assume that salvation can be achieved by hiring a well-known, charismatic CEO from outside the company.  In a world of supply & demand, Boards ask shareholders to pay dearly for such rare talent.  Are the results worth it?<br />According to Collins and his team, such charismatic leaders are NEGATIVELY associated with good to great companies.<br />Ten of the eleven good to great CEOs came from within the company.  Good to great CEOs are self-effacing, even shy.  They have a blend of personal humility combined with fierce determination for the organization as a whole.  Boards of Directors are looking for Julius Caesar when they should be looking for Abraham Lincoln.<br />The research-based nature of this effort takes the book out of the ordinary category of \\"pop\\" management books.  It is a book to read, digest, and re-read.<br />Larry Stybel & Maryanne Peabody
B00006JDVV|5.0|This film was an exceptional action film, but it was also an excellent showcase for some fine acting by all the players. Matthew McConaughey was a realistic fighting man, rough, but sensitive to the plight of his people. The interplay between him and Christian Bale, two strong leaders, was as captivating as the dragon scenes.
B000000WJZ|5.0|Simply the best Pumpkins CD ever made and perhaps one of the greatests cd's ever made.
B000009FHN|3.0|A have nothing against A music fan from Tampa, FL United States, but you have to get the right soundtrack in your review.  Dead Souls was covered for the original Crow soundtrack, not Lost Highway. You should get every soundtrack that Trent does work on, by the way!<br />Whether or not the story and the theme throughout this disc are true to written form (and not interpretational form), the extra track throws the feel of the disc off.  Whoever \\"threw\\" this track on this disc should be hurt.  I guess that there is a convenience factor about having your favorites all on one disc, but if you love NIN, you won't let the fact that they don't have the Xtra track on the orignial pressing get you down.  Leave the rest of the tracks to do that! :)  One kick ass album, though.
0876855583|4.0|Every life is a fantastic piece of living art. Each is as unique as it is identical, and our minds are vessels of change and will. In Charles Bukowski's brilliant, ugly novel Ham On Rye, the reader is introduced to a tormented, strong and ironically delicate protagonist whose own life is his foil, and pain his only crutch. From a silent child to a brooding man who screams with his fists, his life is the focus, and the blurry characters that surround it.<br />Henry Chinaski is a lonely character, tortured by a life he is forced to embrace, though ignorant to its agendas and inner workings. His is an existence swilling with horribly cynical and selfish individuals, numb to their own freedom and influence over those around them. Henry is bombarded with challenges of formidable and often overwhelming bearing, and he is forced to try and understand the will of others and the fickle nature of society, all the while desperate to piece himself together. The story follows Chinaski, from his first inklings of life's frailties to a weathered young man, strong with defeat. Henry's father, who raises him by pushing him down, throws Henry away with sadistic routine, both mentally and physically. His father's explosive anger is only overshadowed by his lust for his own eccentric sense of vanity, which is built up by the breaking down of those around him, acquainted or not. Henry, and his pawn of a mother are always the focus of his tyranny. With growing up comes many problems, challenges that are universal in essence but individual nonetheless.  With Henry, the perils of day-to-day life are only accented by the heavy hardships he is forced to hurdle. From the ever-present, impossible mystery of women to an education system that cannot contain him, and even a horrid case of acne, which only augments Henry's state of isolation, his daunting and unending misfortunes weaken him inside as he grows stronger outside. He is driven to understand a life that he never will, favoring observation over inane experiences. <br />   This is a novel about love, yet devoid of it. Henry's life is as profound as it is random, as ironic as it is seemingly pointless. We follow him through awkward and turbulent adventures, visits with relatives he'll forget, and friends and enemies he'll never really know. The story is varied and raw (a true reflection of life), but Henry's relationship with is father is of central importance. His violent, heatless nature is Henry's only model for personal development. So, instead of embodying his father's twisted idiosyncrasies and strange, consistent machinations towards society, Henry counters his father's personality, and both consciously and subconsciously forces himself farther and father away.  But the more Henry attempts to abandon his father, the more he begins to become him. A hoard of anger calluses over Henry's being, and he becomes short tempered, violent and quick to punches. As he matures, the bottle begins to beget all other events in his life, and becomes a cure for all his mental ailments. He begins to live his life in a drunken haze, throwing away the clear-headed, pessimism of his youth. With this comes a slow realization that the only thing he'll ever understand about life is the pain it brings. It has toppled a spirit that was never really there. <br />Charles Bukowski writes with a brilliant sense of honesty, and raw, intense sympathy for his character. The novel is composed in such a way that it appears as though the Bukowski himself experienced, perhaps autobiographical. His observations are so vivid, simple and yet poignant. The author uses language that is fiercely lyrical and at the same time candid and crude. <br />\\"My spoon was bent so that if I wanted to eat I had to pick the spoon up with my right hand. If I picked it up with my left hand, the spoon bent away from my mouth. I wanted to pick up the spoon with my left hand.\\" <br />With all the pain Henry Chinaski experiences, there is still a strange sense of optimism about the novel. One not only gains appreciation and a better understanding of the fickle nature of our social environment, but also realized how painfully blind we are to each other and our means. Disillusionment is not something one typically grows out of, but rather learns to ignore, and the more one tries to understand the world around us the less one learns. There is no secret to life, and there is no ending, only new beginnings and uncertainty.
0451204530|3.0|Give it 3-1/2 stars but it is notup to the standard we hold Follettto. The plot is good but draggedout and has little suspense.

6304044836|5.0|I was surprised at how good this movie is.  A remake of a movie starring Audrey Hepburn, Humphrey Bogart and William Holden, directed by one of the greats of American cinema, Billy Wilder, is not exactly the kind of task for the faint of heart.  The fact that Sydney Pollack (They Shoot Horses Don't They? (1969), Tootsie (1982), Out of Africa (1985), etc.) decided to do it must have raised a few eyebrows in Hollywood land.<br /><br />And let's just say I had preconceptions as I sat down to watch this.  No way could this be anything near as good as the original.  And for the first twenty minutes or so I was not dissuaded.  Julia Ormond, who was given Miss Hepburn's title role, seemed nothing far removed from ordinary; and Greg Kinnear, who played the playboy David Larrabee, seemed a poor imitation of William Holden.  Of course Harrison Ford, I told myself, is another story, since he is the embodiment of the fulfillment of the desire of many woman, and a fine, accomplished leading man.  He would be, I suspected, the lone bright spot.  In the original, Humphrey Bogart, a little past his prime, and in not exactly the best of moods, and not entirely pleased with the relatively inexperienced Audrey Hepburn, played the cool tycoon Linus Larrabee with some distracted forbearance in what many consider one of his lesser performances.  Surely Harrison Ford could improve on that.<br /><br />He did, but what really surprised me was just how diabolically clever the oh, so romantic script by Barbara Benedek and David Rayfiel turned out to be.  I mean, Cinderella move over.  Sabrina could not have achieved a more glorious existence had she died and gone to heaven.  It is hard to imagine a more fulfilling fantasy for a chauffeur's daughter than what transpires here.<br /><br />Quickly here's the premise of this celluloid fairy tale/romance: Pretty but ordinary Sabrina, born of working class parents, her father the chauffeur of the ultra rich Larrabees, grows up living above the garage in the palatial Larrabee estate.  She watches the lavish parties thrown by the Larrabees from a spot in a tree and falls madly in the kind of puppy love that never goes away with the younger of the Larrabee brothers, David, who is the kind of guy who gives playboys a bad name.  When she comes of age, she goes away to Paris (apparently to work for a fashion magazine: in the original Sabrina, she goes to a cooking school in Paris), picks up confidence and a new kind of eye-popping sophistication, comes back and...well, gets noticed.<br /><br />The basic skeleton of this, the story from the first Sabrina (1954), which is dreamily romantic enough and then some, is greatly augmented here with some very fine psychological touches including developing Sabrina's character beyond the pretty and stylish to something bordering on the wise and heroic.  Suffice it to say that we come away feeling she deserves every rainbow's end she gets.  I can see Benedek and Rayfiel exclaiming with riotous joy as they are writing the script (trading e-mails perhaps): \\"They want romance, they want woman's fantasy?  They want Sabrina to have a pot of gold and true love everlasting?  How about riches beyond counting and the doting attention of the two handsome, very rich brothers?  She can take her pick.  We've give 'em romance, we'll give 'em dreams come true!\\"  And they do.  Not only that, but they keep us guessing about who gets the girl until the last possible moment, and they do that very cleverly.<br /><br />Of course it helps to have professional direction by Sydney Pollack and a fine cast including Harrison Ford--at his best, by the way--and Julia Ormond, a hard-working and talented actress (I recall her from Smilla's Sense of Snow, 1997), who knows how to be cute without fawning, supported by Greg Kinnear, Nancy Marchand, John Wood and Angie Dickinson.  I mention Miss Dickinson because, as the mother of a perspective bride about to throw an incredibly lavish wedding, she gets to deliver this \\"let them eat cake\\" line: \\"We thought we'd use recycled paper\\" (for the wedding invitations).<br /><br />The script is full of similar witticisms, some verbal, some like eye candy.  For example, when Sabrina removes her glasses (the usual Hollywood signal for the adolescent ugly duckling to become a beautiful swan) after gaining sophistication in Paris, she quotes aptly but surprisingly from Gertrude Stein: \\"America is my country and Paris is my home.\\"  (Of course Gertrude Stein never heard of Paris, Texas--but that is another film, and besides, I digress...)<br /><br />I also liked it when Sabrina is in the arms of her Paris would-be lover who kisses her, and--noticing that she is not as engaged as she might me-observes with perfect decorum, \\"I'm embarrassed that you're somewhere else.\\"<br /><br />Memorable was the shot of Harrison Ford momentarily looking jealous and hurt.  By the way, he has a number of good lines, and he delivers them well.  I especially liked it when he sadly confessed: \\"I was sent to deal with you.  I sent myself.\\"<br /><br />It is probably better if you haven't seen the original and can experience this on its own merits without the odiousness that sometimes comes with comparisons.  Comparing Audrey Hepburn with Julia Ormond is like comparing Grace Kelly with Jennifer Lopez.  They really are very different people.  And comparing Billy Wilder's 1954 film (from the play by Samuel Taylor) is a little like comparing Lon Chaney's Phantom of the Opera with Andrew Lloyd Webber's.<br /><br />Bottom line: see this for both Harrison Ford who wears the business-first character of the \\"only surviving heart donor\\" very well, and for Julia Ormond whose intense and beguiling performance makes us forgive her for not being Audrey Hepburn.<br /><br />--Dennis Littrell, author of \\"Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!\\"er this \\"let them eat cake\\" line: \\"We thought we'd use recycled paper\\" (for the wedding invitations).<br /><br />The script is full of similar witticisms, some verbal, some like eye candy.

B00005YW4H|5.0|I have to disagree with some other reviewers who have written that this album really could have used a few more up-tempo tunes, a little more production... hey, maybe bringing in a synth would've perked it up!  We need some speed and some noise to get us going!  Well, okay -- if we wanted this to sound like every other album out there.  <br />But it doesn't, and thank goodness for that.  This is the anti-speed, anti-noise, anti-hype album of 2002.  It's the antidote to American Idol, canned rhythm, shrill dance tracks and copying last year's formula.  <br />Slow down!  Maybe turn out the lights.  Just listen carefully and this record will reward you.  You'll keep hearing more juicy, tasty little bits every time you play it:  the quietly exquisite little guitar solo on &quot;Come Away With Me.&quot;  The intense and unusual vocal harmonies on &quot;I've Got To See You Again.&quot;  The way Jesse Harris's &quot;One Flight Down&quot; sounds like some old classic the first time you hear it, then just gets better with each listening.  The way Ms. Jones swoops and glides over the gentle but compelling rhythm of &quot;Nightingale&quot;, cuts loose a little on the bluesy &quot;Turn Me On,&quot; or drops in her spare, wide-interval piano harmonies throughout.<br />The production is clean and low-key.  You can actually hear each instrument that's playing, yes, almost every note, and they are well-chosen.  The band is great -- it sounds like they're actually listening to one another.  There's no strutting and it seems like it might've been all about the music at this session.<br />I happened to get this CD at the same time I got a Nirvana collection.  Each is fantastic in its own way.  &quot;Come Away With Me&quot; is quietly brilliant -- enjoy it for what it is.
0802130208|4.0|This is a very funny book. The author has an extremely adept comic touch. Most of the humors one finds in fiction are based on irony, witticism, one-liner, and similar \\"static play\\", to be able to write a farce, larger-than-life action-oriented comedy is no small feat, and A Confederacy of Dunces does that almost perfectly. The story moves at a nice rythmn, with fresh comical relief just about where one gets a little tired. A page turner for sure.<br />However, to echo another reviewer's comment, I failed to find deep meaning from all the actions. What is the archetype Ignatius represents? What social or whatever profession the author is trying to make and advance? Does it have to do with a over-30 manchild living with his mother? A clock-work society rejecting the eccentric and, in some way, innocent? Some water color of New Orleans? The book can be said to touch on all these, plus several other subjects (the strike, the porno trade, etc), but does not do a deep enough job for the reader to get it.<br />As a Seinfeld sort of comedy, the novel is very accomplished and a model for this genre. However, compared to a similarly funny and riotous Catch 22, Mr. Toole's offering reveals its defect.
B00006F7S4|5.0|Forget who he is or why he wrote this album.  Who cares what kind of music Beck wrote before?  Who really cares about the girlfriend/breakup of some guy you'll probably never meet?  JUST LISTEN.  &quot;Sea Change&quot; takes you off the beaten track and into deep waters.  This album reminds me of why I rejected mainstream pop in my early teens and went for all that dirge stuff.  Beck, thank you for your attempt to save us from choking on our own pretentious pop-culture backwash.<br />I think that while &quot;Lost Cause&quot; is a good track, it is not really representative of what this album has to offer.  Don't judge this album by its' single.  I think &quot;Sea Change&quot; is a step backward in time with respect to emotion and pacing, but definitely very contemporary with respect to the musical style and effects.  The result, for me, is pure bliss.  It's nice not to have to dig way back into my collection and sacrifice new, experimental sound for some music with genuine emotion.  Put this album on, turn it up loud, and listen carefully.  Beck is doing you a favor.
0060977493|4.0|The initial impression was that Ms. Roy was a mini-Rushdie, more under control, less intimidating in rhetoric sweep and parody. After some reflection, it seemed equally just to say that Roy is anti-Rushdie, that is, she presents roughly the same subject from a feminine point of view. In that light, I believe Ms. Roy is has rare talent.<br />Ms. Roy shows remarkable control and dexterity in building the story to a climatic, though sad, ending. The plot and characters driving the story are mostly well done. And the ironic touch has the grace missing from, say, Rushdie's showmanship. It is a worthy read.<br />Where the book is inferior to Rushdie's best is in the areas of abstraction and allegories to India or human existence in general. The \\"moral\\" of God of Small Things tends to be old and unimaginative. It fails to wow the reader. The story is moving and well-told, but that is thanks to the author's writing skill more than her philosophical insight. Some reviewers have complained about the gimmick of capitalization, etc. I share this criticism, even though the irony behind the words is generally refreshing.

079070546X|4.0|Delightful holiday epic centering around the good-natured Clark Griswold, and his family.  Beverly D'Angelo looked especially good in this.  I have since had dreams of her in a Santa cap (and nothing else).  Rusty and Audrey were kinda lame in the movie.  Randy Quaid was a jerk, but that is his appeal.  I would give this 1/2 thumbs up (due to amputation).
B00005JKJA|4.0|The first time I saw 'Mulholland Drive' I enjoyed the filmmaking, but saw it as a TV pilot with a tacked-on ending that didn't coherently relate to the body of the work. Then I watched it again, months later. I have now seen it three times, and it is my favorite movie of 2001. Not only is it completely cohenrent, but Lynch has commented on the failure of the piece as a TV pilot with his movie ending. The movie is both the character Diane and director David Lynch's dream gone bad. If you have seen this movie and sort of enjoyed it but dismissed it, watch it again. The two &quot;parts&quot; do, indeed, form one sad, devastating story. And Naomi Watts, as I did recognize the first time I saw it, not only should have been nominated for an Oscar but should have won. Easily. Her performance alone is worth watching this movie for. Unfortunately, the DVD does not contain any extras or even chapter selections. If you can play multi-region DVDs, the French DVD is the way to go. Otherwise, this one is still worth getting. It's truly a masterpiece, and I don't say that often.
B00004Z4WQ|1.0|This was the worst movie I have ever seen in my life.  Tim Curry could've done WAY better than this piece of [junk]... (pardon my French).  If they had a '0 star' rating, I would have picked that one for sure.  It wasn't even funny.  It probably would have been funny if they didn't do all those disgusting things.  AND THE LANGUAGE!!!  I NEVER heard so much foul language from anyone's mouth in my life.  When I bought it, I thought it was going to be good.  The advertisements about it on TV looked good.  I don't recommend this movie to anyone, especially little kids.  The TV ads made it look like it was a good, funny, family movie.  What I do recommend is that you rent any movie first before you buy.
B00000J2SS|5.0|As another mentioned, it would be great to have more from Rainbow, especially more of the era spanning 1980-1984.  It was a bit of a catch 22 to see Ritchie Blackmore return to Deep Purple late in 1984, even though it produced the exceptional \\"Perfect Strangers\\" album.  I once had \\"Finyl Vinyl\\" on cassette tape, album, and on CD, all at once!  I don't really know how that happened but it is truly a great compilation.  \\"Spotlight Kid\\", \\"I Surrender\\" and \\"Street of Dreams\\" are much better live than their respective studio versions.  Perhaps, though, the \\"Japan Tour 84\\" CD ought to be re-released to do the Blackmore, Turner, Glover, Burgi, and Rosenthal line-up justice.  What really catches the listener is just how good Chuck Burgi is on drums.  A fast and furious drummer with remarkable precision.
B000065VB0|5.0|INTRUDER'S HAPPY IN THE DDDDAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRKKKKKKKKKK!!!!!<br />It was 1980, Gabriel was going solo for the past 3 years at this point. The previous album \\"Peter Gabriel 2: Scratch\\", laid the foundation for this one except that one did suffer from the cloudy production from Robert Fripp yet benefited from it's raw beauty in the songs. The morbid yet blue/jazz influenced \\"Home Sweet Home\\" marked what was to come at the ending of the 2nd album. Even the morbidity of that song was nothing compared to the frightening darkness and the alienated, black & white mood of Peter Gabriel 3 a.k.a Melting Face. The melting photograph perfectly shows the mood of the record: DARK & TERRORIZING!<br />Intruder could as well get my nod as the most frightening song ever recorded to tape. The song begins with echoing Phil Collins-style drums and the sound of wires being pulled and ripped out of a wall and then distorted chords come and shrieking voice effects come in with lyrics that tell the story of a burglar breaking into someone's home. Few songs scared me in such a pleasant way like this song did when I first listened to it. Just don't play it at 3.a.m. alone in the dark. Hehe! >:D \\"No Self Control\\" is a theme that tells the story of an Obsessive Compulsive Disorder patient who's about to commit something terrible due to the OCD disorder and finding it impossible to resist doing. The song begins with low-pitched xylophones before blasting into an explosive rocking track. A 1 minute 20 second instrumental called \\"Start\\" is a bizarre 'interlude' with a saxophone that provides the calm between the previous track and the next on but with an unpleasant calm. The quietness is suddenely ended with the banging loud drums of \\"I Don't Remember\\"The song begins with Gabriel's chaotic howling and becomes a chaotic, chilling, tale of an amnesiac who is being persecuted by authorities. The really awesome part though is the raging, blazing guitars at the ending combined with the sounds of (I guess) an alarm buzzer and the guitars and buzzer sound effects fading out will leave you with chills running throughout you. I just love those rock guitars at the ending. A piano intro brings us to what I consider the most disturbing track that PG has ever written: Family Snapshot. Don't be fooled by the title. It's a tale of an assassin who assassinates a well-known politician or entertainer just to get attention. The song gradually builds up from the calm pianos at the beginning into a scorching rock song kind of like preparing us for the terrible event that's about to occur. The song suddenly quiets down with \\"And I'll let the bullet, FFFLLLYYYYY!!!!!!\\", and then the calmness brings us to a flashback of a time when the assassin as a young boy, was alone & lonely after relations between his parents turns violent and the distraught of his desperations ends the song with the echoing piano. \\"And Through The Wire\\" is a more upbeat rocker with a poppier atmosphere that tells the tale of a murderer. \\"Games Without Frontiers\\" was Gabriel's first American charting single. The song is a New Wavish, song that denounces war and tells the tale of children being forced to fight in warfare. I just love the lyrical line \\"If looks could kill, they probably will\\", CLASSIC!! If you like this version, check out the Massive/DB mix of GWF available on Pure Moods III. Where the version on here is quirky, eerie, and bleak, the version on Pure Moods III is a dark, haunting, ambient version with a much more twilight mood. Overall, the Pure Moods III version almost sounds like a totally different song altogether. Both versions are awesome. \\"Not One Of Us\\" is another scorching rocker similar to \\"Through The Wire\\". The song from what I can understand, tells the tale of someone being singled out of a crowd, either because of ethnicity, religious belief, race, or simply because he or she is different. I love the wavy guitars at the ending. \\"Lead A Normal Life\\" is the only mellow track on the album. Don't think that this is a ballad. The first 40 or so seconds give the feeling of the song being the nice part of the LP until ominous keyboards and the howling buzz screams come in giving the peacefulness of the song an unpleasant odor. The song eventually turns out to portray the dreamy haze of a mentally ill patient at a dilapidated mental institution. This to me, is the scariest song after \\"Intruder\\" because of it's blissful yet burning wirey eeriness. The last track \\"Biko\\" wraps up the dark mind trip of PG 3 with recording samples of a choiring protest and becomes a chilling, and eerie song with piercing guitars and African drums. \\"Biko\\" is a song dedicated to anti-apartheid activist Steven Biko, who was murdered in 1977. The song fades back down into the protesters chanting which is ending by the sound of a drum, ending the album.<br />This album, as well as SO, stands as Gabriel's strongest, and most consistent of his entire catalog. Caution!: If you're looking for \\"Sledgehammer-like\\" or \\"In Your Eyes\\", PG3 is not the one to look for but for those who want to hear something different than what casual fans go for, PG3 is an absolute must.  . The remastered edition is astounding, bringing out more details and higher volume in the songs, giving them even more power than they did on the older masters. When the album was finished being recorded and produced, Atlantic refused to release it out of feeling that it wasn't commercial and dropped Gabriel from their label. After Peter Gabriel signed up to Geffen, had PG3 released, well, let's just say that Atlantic have regretted it ever since then.bum. Don't think that this is a ballad.

630027120X|5.0|I loved all your reviews and I along with you believe that this movie should be available in DVD version. I saw this movie in one of my Latin American classes and it touched me very fast. The way that the movie was shot and the sound track are great. Its one of those movies that makes people think about things. The cast was awesome. If you guys figure anything out about the DVD version please contact me.
0380789035|5.0|Finally finished reading American Gods! I didn't want to put it down once I started reading. I love the theories about Gods ... how they came to exist ... the \\"humanity\\" of them ... beauty! I wish there were more books like this.<br />There is a conversation between Odin and Eostre where he is trying to win her to his side and she points out that Easter is still celebrated. Odin asks their waitress what the word Easter means and the waitress replies that she is Pagan and doesn't know anything about that Christian stuff! *pelts waitress with Ostara eggs* \\"I think it's like Latin or something for 'God has risen', maybe.\\" Odin then asks her who she worships and the woman couldn't name a single goddess ... she says the female principal or some such thing. Mother, that gave me a laugh!<br />\\"Say 'Nevermore,'\\" .... There was alot of humor in this book. Not at all expected, considering the serious events, deaths, incarcerations and persecution, but most definitely appreciated. A sub-plot mistery was rather obvious from nearly the start of it, but not in it's entirety. Major plot twist towards the end that seeemed obvious throughout the book, but only once they began to reveal it. Definitely a good read. I'd definitely recommend it ... in fact my husband is reading it right now. I feel a bit bereft now that it's over. If this is a fair representation of his work, I'm going to have to pick up another Gaiman book.
B00003CXAA|5.0|So many things have been said and written about the Godfather Saga, that it is hard to come up with something original to say about the movies.  I guess what strikes me the most is the way Michael totally missintrptets his role as the head of the family.  And Family is the key word here.  He takes what his father has built and destroys it because he forgets what family means.  That one thing is why The Godfather movies are so good.  Coppola in showing the rise and fall of Michael Corleone makes a a point of what absolute power does to a person.  A Masterpiece of film making.  A+++++++
B00005YW4H|4.0|Holly Cole.<br />Basically, whenever I hear Norah Jones, who has a wonderful voice and does a great job with these songs and the music on this disc, I can't help but think about Holly Cole.  Norah sounds to me like a younger, less mature version of Holly... so if you're looking for more, I'd check out It Happened One Night, first, and then Dear Dark Heart second.
B00003CX8V|5.0|Who would have thought that a dark romantic comedy set against a backgroud of corparate politics and sex in the 50's could win best picture in 1960.  Billy Wilder's very dark and sometimes shocking film The Apartment did just that!!!!!  In his best film Wilder scores a knockout.  With telling the story of C.C. Baxter(Jack Lemmon),a loner, working for an insurance company  and his dealings with his bosses and love for an elevator opporator named Fran(Shirley MacLaine).  This movie is almost a satire of corporate America in the 50's.  A story of how people get used and the people who use them.  With a dark wit Wilder pushes the envelope of what people were used to seeing in a comedy, remember this movie was made in 1960.  Now he had made and would make other dark movies, examples Lost Weekend or the film nior classic Double Indemnity.  But most were drama's and none had the wicked satire of the Apartment.  Lemmon, Maclaine and Fred MacMurray all give great performances.  A +++++++++++++
6305342776|3.0|I just picked up the DVD and watched it for the first time since the mid 80's when it was on VHS. Disney really had a chance to make a great movie that could have appealed to science fiction fans and have a blockbuster hit. They had a great concept, plot, a good enough cast, and excellent SFX and lots of cash to spend (20+ Million) but they blew it on the execution because they had to make it safe and freindly for the little kids and protect the Disney family name. <br />Had this movie came out in the 50's or early 60's it would have become a classic Sci-Fi film, but in 1979 it looked horribly dated even with state of the art effects and brilliant set design - the film's sole saving grace and what die-hard movie fans of this genre should watch this movie for. <br />The dialog is cornball, the acting is cardboard and hammy, and the robots are right out of DisneyLand - silly (but fun), whoever came up with their trashcan designs proably worked at Hanna-Barbera or Fisher-Price and should have been canned. At least they is they are voiced by two great actors (Roddy McDowell and Slim Pickens) and arent nearly as annoying as Jar Jar Binks! <br />And another thing - after 20 years the hell/heven ending still doesnt make a lot of sense. The movie makes no real explanation about what the Black Hole is. (then again who knows what the heck it is?!) <br />Still, if you're a fan of cheesy Sci-Fi or have memories of watching it when you were a kid I say go rent/buy the DVD - the transfer is sharp (but not as sharp as it could have been - This movie BEGS for a high quality collectors package like TRON), sound quality is great and you can even see the piano wires holding up the robot Vincent! Just turn your mind off and enjoy the ride.
0783225482|5.0|I absolutely love this movie.  It is great in so many respects and is much more than just fantastic special effects.  It is laugh out loud funny.  I never get tired of watching it, and every time I see it I catch something I didn't see before.  Sometimes I really wonder if certain actresses who never seem to age really have taken some magic potion.<br />As far as the dvd goes, I have really been craving a \\"deleted scenes\\" feature for this movie.  I have long heard about the alternate ending that was shot and dropped at the last minute - I remember someone telling me it involved Streep and Hawn's characters on a mountain in Switzerland trying to come up with new things to do or places to go and finding immortality to be quite boring.  There are also entire scenes with Tracy Ullman that were fully cut from this movie when her character was completely deleted.  And, there is the msytery of the Greta Garbo actress on the end credits.  Someone is listed as having portrayed Garbo in the movie, but I have never been able to find her in the film.  James Dean, Marilyn Monroe, Andy Warhol, Elvis, and Jim Morrison are clearly at Lisel's party...but I don't know where Garbo is supposed to be (yet, a scene with her was evidently shot, since an actress is credited as playing her).  That scene must also have been cut.  <br />I think this would be a terrific film to have some behind the scenese featurette for as well.  In 1992, the effects used here were revolutionary...though Forrest Gump, made a few years later, gets most of the credit for being groundbreaking in this field.  I remember being totally blown away with what was achieved in Death Becomes Her and would love to know exactly what went into making it.  I think it would also be interesting to hear from Zemeckis himself exactly what motivated him to make this movie - I bet he would have some interesting stories to tell about his own experiences with \\"the walking dead of Beverly Hills\\".  <br />I doubt they will be making aspecial edition dvd of this movie any time soon.  There isn't any great public demand for it.  But, I hope that when the milestone anniversaries of this film come around someone will reconsider this dvd oversight and include all the cut scenes and other standard featurettes that go into dvds these days.<br />The movie is too good to skimp on this stuff.  And I truly would like to be able to see how Greta Garbo was featured in this film.  I think that scene could have been really interesting.

B0000039LE|5.0|Legendary movie director John Carpenter produced this low-budget film which has become a horror movie classic.  It stars Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasence.  The plot is fairly simple.  In 1963, Michael Myers murdered his older sister.  After spending fifteen years in a mental hospital, Michael manages to escape and he returns to the town of Hattonfield, Il, where he goes on another murderous rampage, this time selecting young teenagers as his victims.<br />Scream queen Jamie Lee Curtis stars as Laurie Strode, a bookwormish high school student who can't find a date and volunteers to babysit for some of the neighborhood children on Halloween.  Some of her friends are babysitting as well, and they keep each other company by talking on the phone.  However, Michael is determined to break up the fun, while  Dr. Sam Loomis (played by legendary actor Donald Pleasance), tries in vain to find Michael and return him to the hospital.<br />This is the first truly &quot;scary&quot; movie that I can remember watching, and it has become a classic over time.  The sequels that followed were no where near as good as the original. The music and the dark scenery are what make this movie so scary.  The actors do a good job as well.  This is a must movie for all true horror fans.
B00005AQF7|5.0|This is a classic in every sense of the word. Snoop was such an influential lyricist (even though he sounded a TAD better on The Chronic). The best songs were the ones that he didn't release like &quot;Ain't No Fun&quot; and the Slick Rick remake, &quot;Lodi Dodi&quot;. Get this album now if you don't have it yet, because Snoop doesn't sound this good anymore.
B000003S09|4.0|One of the first and certainly one of the best bands to emerge from the British Progressive Rock scene, King Crimson's constant perseverance and reliability have come to distinguish them as a force to be reckoned with.  However, long before King Crimson had built such an impressive resume of albums, which span 3 decades and include numerous different lineups, \\"In the Court of the Crimson King\\" introduced this band's creative vision to the world. Playing alongside groups like the Rolling Stones in England, King Crimson's first studio effort sounded like nothing else present on the 1969 music scene.  The album's interesting mix of medieval, somber ballads and paranoid, madhouse rockers took rock music one step further than it had ever been before and was instantly deemed wildly influential after being hailed by overwhelming critical acclaim. Even the vividly grotesque cover art was completely avant-garde in 1969 and while time has often not been too kind to most of England's Prog bands, \\"In the Court of the Crimson King\\" is still a fairly biting and very relevant album today.  Starting with what sounds like a distant foghorn, \\"...Crimson King\\" proceeds to run through three exceptionally modern sounding songs from the early Crimson repertoire.  The searing guitar and scathing lyrics of \\"21st Century Schizoid Man\\" still excite and tantalize as much as they did over 30 years ago and continue to provide a brilliant musical description of the Crim's main modus operandi literally decades after its conception.  \\"I Talk to the Wind\\" and \\"Epitaph\\" also both still sound as beautiful and full as they ever did, particularly after Robert Fripp's new digital remastering. Furthermore, with the new emergence of the modern indie genre that has come to be known as post-rock, these extended, soulful ballads have been gaining added importance as vitally integral influences and important touchstones for groups like Tortoise and Cul De Sac.  Actually, my only real complaint with this albumwould with the song Moonchild.  While the improvisational meandering of Moonchild are at times interesting and probably sounded quite cutting edge at the time, they simply carry on for far too long without reaching any true climax or point.  With a band as skilled and multitalented as King Crimson, particularly in the realm of improvisation as their live shows often highlight, it's disappointing that the album cut chosen to represent Crimson's less song oriented side was not one of their better takes.  Moonchild highlights the flaws of this album, showing that even though \\"In the Court of the Crimson King\\" is and was a good CD, it failed to completely capture the essence of King Crimson the way that subsequent albums would.  The CD ends on a strong note though with the grand, flowing title track and unless you are a true Crimson fanatic, the brief period of less than perfect song writing will most likely go largely unnoticed.  All in all, even though it is in my opinion not one of the most accurate or striking representations of King Crimson's multifaceted style, the lasting importance and revolutionary concepts of \\"In the Court of the Crimson King\\" still certify it as a near necessity in most record collections.
B00004Z4WQ|5.0|SCary Movie is hilarious!! It's a total spoof on all of the Teen horror/thriller movies like the Scream series, I Know What You Did Last Summer and Urban Legend. The Wayans came out swinging with this one and scored a KO. Scary Movie will have you laughing from beginning to end.<br />Honest to God, funniest scene in the entire movie is when the Gym Teacher (Ms Mann) crosses her legs. Oh and by the way, there is a lot of sexual humor in this movie and of course some nudity and drug use and swearing but other than that, it's funny as hell. I wouldn't suggest this to any younger viewers because of that reason. I just think that it has too much sexual comedy that younger viewers either won't get it or take it the wrong way.<br />Scary Movie is a total plus. Get this one and while you're at it, get the movies that it makes fun of like the Scream series and Urban Legend. Just to add to your collection. Again, excellent movie!
B00005JLS0|2.0|Two Weeks Notice marks the first time collaboration between two of the biggest names in romantic comedy.  With a combined resume of past works consisting Bridget Jone's Diary, Notting Hill, Forces of Nature, and While You Were Sleeping, it is quite surprising that it took so long for Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock to work together until now.  Both actors have accumulated quite a fan following, so there is no doubt that the film will be profitable, even in the midst of a month crowded with quality movies, but will it be worth your time and the price of the admission?<br />A Harvard law school graduate, Lucy Kelson (Sandra Bullock) dedicates most of her time to preserving historical landmarks the big corporations of New York are bent on destroying for the sake of urban development.  In her efforts to save the Coney Island community center, she makes a deal with George Wade (Hugh Grant) of the Wade Corporations.  In return for his promise to keep the building, she agrees to take the job as his new chief counsel.  However, everything does not go according to Lucy's plan.  Instead of her dreams of utilizing the company's vast resources to address issues she is most passionate about and to help those that are less fortunate, she finds herself at George's beck and call, making every decisions from his wardrobe to his prospective dates.  Realizing that this is not what she signed on for, Lucy decides to call it quits, but George refuses to let her go until she finds a replacement for herself, a task that becomes increasingly harder as the days go by.<br />It is a good thing that Bullock and Grant are both very likeable on screen, because even though the characters they often portray are very similar, you nevertheless enjoy their performances due to the personalities they bring to these roles.  Unfortunately, this is not the case in Two Weeks Notice.  In fact, I found myself feeling apathetic towards Lucy and George, and I really could care less what happens to them.  This isnot to say that Bullock and Grant did not try their best, the problem is they had very little to work with, since how can you breathe life to characters that don't have any to start off with?<br />Although the chemistry is definitely there among the two leads, it just does not seem to work.  To me Lucy and George act more like a pair of bickering siblings than a couple; their constant bantering and arguments did not help to convince me of their unspoken love and attraction towards each other.  I am sad to say that I was extremely bored by the experience, and the laughs are too few and far in between.<br />The bottom line is that Two Weeks Notice is neither funny nor romantic.  The dialogues are flat and the characters are stereotypically predictable.  Scenes rarely flow smoothly from one to the other, the whole film feels very much like going through a scrapbook where random events are cut and pasted together.  The worse thing about it is the blatant attempt to sell a mediocre story based on the strengths and popularity of two well-established veterans of the genre.  If there is one movie that can make both Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock dull and unattractive to watch, this is definitely it.  I simply cannot recommend Two Weeks Notice, it is clearly deserving of a pink slip.
B00005O5CM|4.0|Legally Blonde was pretty good for what it was. I still think that parts of this movie has things that only a girl could appreciate but the rest of it was pretty funny.<br />Witherspoon stars as Elle Woods and after getting dumped by her boyfriend, she decides to get him back by the only way possible... GO TO HARVARD LAW! In doing so she finds that she's more than just a pretty face, she's a top notch defense. Along the way, she tries to win back her beau only to fund out that he got engaged to a mean uptight Selma Blair who is constantly making her stay at Harvard an uncomfortable one. In the end she puts her Law skills to the test as she finds herself in a heated Murder trial. It's up to Elle to come out on top.<br />O.k. this is yet another comedy where you have to take it was it is. In any case, it's a funny movie and Witherspoon does reallt well in this role. A lot of people have plugged this as the new CLUELESS and I personally don't think it is because the 2 movies are completely different. The only thing the 2 share in common is that the lead is played by a beautiful, yet somewhat ditsy girl but other than that TOTALLY DIFFERENT and should not be compared to each other.<br />Definately get this movie because it'll make you laugh. It's a lot of cutesy and fluff so girls will get into this movie and any guys with a good sense of humor will also get a kick out of this one. If you're looking for other Reese Witherspoon movies, check out PLEASANTVILLE and CRUEL INTENTIONS as well.
0060523794|3.0|Considering the career path that Lou Gerstner has followed, this book doesnt come close to its potential.  That being said it is an interesting book about the turnaround for IBM and a few key insights of a high level CEO is shared with the reader. The book never comes really under the skin of neither IBM or Lou Gerstner, but ofcourse thats an opening for a sequal.
0670824399|5.0|The book is about the little girl Matilda. She's about five years old. Her family doesn't care much about her, they mostly care about money, the TV and bingo. Matilda is very talented, she can read already and she loves it. Her first day at school her teacher, Miss Honey, notices that Matilda is very talented. She goes to the Headmistress to ask if Matilda can jump to the final grade. But Miss Trunchbull (the headmistress), who doesn't like children, doesn't believe Miss Honey.<br />I don't want to reveal all of it but the bok is about the &quot;war&quot; against the Trunchbull, because nobody likes her. I think it is a nice end to the book anyway.<br />It wasn't too hard to read the book because it is a children's book. It is easy and fun language. The characters are also funny. Like the father who is selling broken cars, the platinum blonde mother and the Trunchbull, who hates children and usually swing girls by their pigtails above her head and then throws them out the window.<br />It is a good book and well worth reading.
B00000DHR0|5.0|Nearly every successful artist has recorded a Christmas album, but few can stand up to Celine Dion's &quot;These Are Special Times&quot;. Filled with beautifully-performed tracks, this record will be forever remembered as a timeless classic.<br />Opening up with the cathartic hymn, 'O Holy Night', Dion uses her strong vocal chords to send the sacred piece into the heavens, then gently brings it back to earth. 'Ave Maria' is beautifully enhanced by her tender vocals, adding an unusual touch to this Christmas compilation.<br />What makes this album different from all of the other Christmas records out there is its diversity in music. Everyone can sing 'Joy to the World'. Celine brings listeners something different, uniting both sacred and secular tracks in one seamless arrangement. New songs 'Christmas Eve' and 'Another Year Has Gone By' stand proudly aside classics such as 'Feliz Navidad' and, my personal favorite, 'Happy XMas (War is Over)'. <br />If you're looking for a great Christmas album that truly captures the tenderness and joy of the holidays, look no further. Celine Dion has captured the spirit of the season through this album, proving that these are, indeed, special times.
B0000640VO|4.0|Although this movie is not in english, the english subtitles are easy to read so you can fully enjoy the story without being to distracting. The story line is so charming. It has a great plot twist. If it was in english I would have given it 5 stars. Its the best foreign film story I have ever seen.
B00006RU5B|3.0|This combination should have spawned a bone jarring rock powerhouse of a record, instead it provides maybe two good rockers and the rest is really a bunch of forgetable ballads. When I heard of the Sound/Rage combo I thought this would be one of the heaviest of the genre but I was really dissapointed some of it puts me to sleep. Give me a break guys....when this band was formed what did you think your fans would want? Not the majority of this. Where is Kim these days? If you want heaviness check out the stoner rock scene.
B00006CXXU|5.0|This is it!! A great voice and catchy tunes. Take a look at the lyricks!!!<BR>I have always favoured Christina over Britney, not only in voice but also on the dare to be different looks.<BR>Here in Holland Britney has always been precieved as dull and boring...until she made Slave for U..but that didn't got on for the simple fact that she put on a show.<BR>Some comments were that Christina looked like a hootchie mamma but let me tell you: Her voice is great just as her talent.<BR>Sure , you might think she is a hootchie mamma but she does it with style...you go girl!!!
B00006LLNV|5.0|An excellent soundtrack for those who love inspired mexican music.  I loved each one of the songs especially &quot;La bruja&quot; performed by Salma Hayek, &quot;la Llorona&quot;, and &quot;Paloma Negra&quot;.<br />The music is the essence of the movie.<BR>A story that transports us through a life of an incredible, beautiful and inspiring woman. A woman that gives taste to life, beauty to the ugliness of things and strength to our weaknesses.A CD beautiful all throughout.
B0000071J0|4.0|I like Le Orme a lot. Apparently, this record is one of people's favorites. There are some really cool moments. The keyboard player is exceptional. I can not get enough of him on this record. Much of the record has the standard art rock melodic flows, but an appropriate amount of punctuation. It leaves me wanton. Clearly in tune with the Art rock scene of it's day, it is still a very good spin.
B00006HBUA|1.0|Normally I stick to the manga and japanese anime section of amazon.com, but I felt I had to write a review for this movie. Basically, I thought this movie was horrible. Anyone who did not go to see this movie for its actors will be surely disappointed. The plot was nonexistent, the acting was severely lacking, and the many special effects were clearly fake. My advice: don't get this movie until you've seen it beforehand and you know whether it's worth your money.<br />The transition from cartoon to live acting was a total bust. Cartoon gags, such as slipping on bananna peels, etc, are all very well and good when drawn with pencil and paper, but when they are performed by living actors, what was formerly funny is now just plain stupid. I think that they should have either stuck with cartoons, or left the outrageous gags out of the movie. It was an idea that could have worked, but the makers of this film completely failed in their endeavour. Not to mention the cast. WB picked a stellar and well-known cast, but this movie is just... not their best performance.<br />&lt;i wrote this a long time ago when i had nothing better to do. ignore my rabid rantings, or not, as you please.>

B00007BHOE|5.0|I am very pleased with this DVD. I'm not the biggest, hardcore fan of Slipknot, but I really enjoyed this DVD. The concert was filmed with 30 cameras, edited so it seems like a music video. It has fantastic quality. The DVD also includes many features such as behind the scenes and all of their music videos. Sure this may not be good as a concert, but who cares?? Slipknot isnt going to be touring anywhere in the US for a long time. I highly recomend this DVD to any Slipknot fan.
0385508417|5.0|This story was well paced, light, and fun. The premise of the story is this: daughter is gone to Peru so parents decide to save the $6100 they normally spend, avoid all things Christmas, and go on a cruise.  Of course, things can't be that simple.  Neighborhood decorating warfare ensues, leading to a near arrest.  Gossip and pettiness abounds.  Grisham takes a total break from his lawyer thriller style to deliver a nice tale of Christmas that should make anyone think twice about both the money we spend on the holidays and skipping Christmas!
B00005JL0I|5.0|I used to watch this movie all the time when I was a kid.  The pretty colors and shapes dazzled me, and even as a child I could appreciate the beauty of a gaggles of hot girls in skimpy clothing.  After seeing that it was released on DVD, I had to get it, for nostalgia's sake.  I found that I still very much enjoyed the film, but there are so many other things that I picked up watching it later.  I am sure that it is obvious from the cover that the movie has a strong sixties drug overtone.  Spinning lights and shapes are pleading to be watched under the influence.  You know that there is a drug undercurrent when there are in a room filling with gas, and they use it to blow the door open, and that gas is Lysergic Acid...  not so flammable, but is the main ingredient in LSD.  I also noticed the absurdity of so many scenes.  As a child I accepted a lot of it, but watching it now and seeing dazzling sparkles and colored lights behind Orson Welles as he does stage magic at the baccarat table, or the British government blowing up the estate of James Bond to get him to go on another mission...  it was nonsense.  Put all the humor, the all star cast, a decidedly non-annoying performance by Woody Allen, and a brilliant score by Burt Bacharach and Herb Alpert...  you have a definite classic, and a definite winner.<br />Even without taking drugs...
B00002ZMNV|5.0|S&amp;M is a rocking set! From &quot;The Call of Ktulu&quot; to &quot;Until it Sleeps&quot;, from &quot;For Whom The Bell Tolls&quot; to &quot;One&quot;, this 2 CD set brings new life to many songs from past albums, as well as the latest albums. &quot;The Call of Ktulu&quot; is absolutely dynamic, &quot;Until it Sleeps&quot; has dramatic use of strings, and each song is complimented by the orchestra. Many songs became even more powerfull versions of their still powerfull original recordings.<br />The best music from Metallica since The Black Album.

B00006J9OT|5.0|The opening tune is a Peggy Lee/William Schluger composition called \\"I LOVE BEING HERE WITH YOU\\", featuring some great vocalizing by Krall and tickling the ivory's that only she can, her back up is Anthony Wilson (guitar), John Clayton (bass) and Jeff Hamilton (drums) shades of the  King Cole Trio come to mind.  Smooth sounds of \\"LET'S FALL IN LOVE\\", a classic standard by Harold Arlen/Ted Koehler sends the listener into the realm of pure ecstasy.  Mesmerizing and tranquil vibes within an original style in this Burt Bacharach/Hal David \\"THE LOOK OF LOVE\\", sends a message of sensual feelings that Krall brings to the surface ~ must make mention this sounds better \\"Live\\", something in Krall's voice gives this more substance.<br />Some stand outs ~ \\"I'VE GOT YOU UNDER MY SKIN\\", nothing can top this Cole Porter selection that only two people I know give this their own signature, of course Frank Sinatra is the first and now Diana Krall comes to the forefront, not bad company to be in---beautiful arrangement  by Alan Broadbent music director, conductor of the Orchestre Symphonique Europeen, this song really gets under your skin, gotta love it.  Some great jazz piano on \\"DEVIL MAY CARE\\", Krall and her group are really having a swinging good time, and it shows.  One of my all-time favorite songs is \\"MAYBE YOU'LL BE THERE\\", songwriters Rube Bloom/Sammhy Gallop hit the mark with words and music, Diana takes it to a higher level with this intimate arrangement.<br />My highlight pick is \\"A CASE OF YOU\\", love this song, love Joni Mitchell (artist/composer) and Love Diana Krall with the lyrics pouring from her soul, this song especially shows what a terrific singer she is.  Another highlight has to be \\"JUST THE WAY YOU ARE\\", the never to be forgotten Billy Joel hit, Krall and her style take over, she's right at home with this one.  If you're not a fan by this time, there is no hope for you.  This album is a keeper for the jazz-buff in all of us, take it from me this is well worth the money and then some.<br />Total Time 70:11 on 12 Tracks ~ Verve 440-065-109-2 ~ (2002)he money and then some.<br />Total Time 70:11 on 12 Tracks ~ Verve 440-065-109-2 ~ (2002)
0515127485|5.0|This is a fantastic, precisely paced thriller. It also doubles as alternate history. The writing is crisp and tight. The plot moves fluidly through all the necessary dramatic twists and turns that are necessary to make a very good thriller. This is highly recommended.
B00005JLRR|3.0|As several people have pointed out, this movie is most definitly a clone of ST2.  Here are what I considered the parallels (SPOILER ALERT SO PROCEED WITH CAUTION):<br />Enemy with a vengenance factor:  Khan and Shinzon both had a grudge against the captain of the Enterprise<br />A Very bad weapon:  Genesis and the Planet Destroyer Romulan Ship<br />A Space Cloud that hinders sensors and communications:  Mutara Nebula and the green cloud that Nemesis takes place<br />A Death of a major character:  Spock and Data<br />The Death of the major character saving the lives of everyone else:  Spock gets Warp engines to work, Data destroys the ship that was about to fire.<br />The possibility that the major character will be resurrected:  Spock doing the mind meld with McCoy, Data doing a memory duplication with B4<br />A death scene of the villan with some a vengeful line of dialogue:  Khan quotes Moby Dick and Shinzon was happy that Picard and him would die together<br />Realization of someone that was related to you: Kirk meets David, Picard meets Shinzon<br />SPOILER END<br />I think there were some other minor things but I can't recall them.  Anyway, after saying all that, I would still recommend this movie for people as some good matinee entertainment.  I liked the battle sequences and the acting, for the most part, was okay.  The wedding sequence didn't work for me (it seemed very forced), Riker leaving to his own command didn't have the emotional impact that I thought it could have, and I was slightly dumbfuddled that no mention of Lore was to be found when B4 was first discovered.<br />But, all in all, it wasn't that bad, just not original.
B000002BFL|5.0|I've listened to Springsteen only since Born in the USA (funny how many people miss the point behind that song...) but have since grown to appreciate him as another troubador for the rest of us.<br />I live in Youngstown, the town in the song on the album by the same name.  It is a working class town devastated by the exit of the steel mills in the 70s and 80s, much like Springsteen sings about his hometown on Born in the USA.  He sings it because he knows it.  And it shows.  He may not know Youngstown but he's pretty darn close to the reality of many living here.<br />He played here on his acoustic tour in support of this album (sadly, I din't have the connections to get tickets; ironically, the 'common man' doesn't really count when it comes to Springsteen tickets).  Stranger yet (similar to Born in the USA being used as a political campaign song), radio stations here played it with pride!  Guess they didn't listen to the lyrics.<br />Anyhow, Springsteen is a voice crying out in the wilderness of America, speaking for those whose voices are rarely heard and, if they are, they are generally heard as part of some political agenda or other.  He gives voice to the homeless, to migrant workers, to released convicts trying to keep straight and to a whole host of other characters who really make up the American landscape.  <br />It sounds stark only if you haven't been paying attention to what is going on beneath the surface in this country.  While it is not overly joyous, there are moments of beauty and poetry to be found, even in the midst of this apparent bleakness.  Springsteen, as always, captivates and tells stories that put you there; you can see, hear and even taste the characters he is singing about.<br />While there are more instruments present here than in Nebraska, it is still relatively bare and buoys the lyrics quite nicely.  <br />On an aside, this album finds its roots in the book called Journey to Nowhere: The Sage of the New Underclass by Dale Maharidge(sadly, currently out of print) which begins in Youngstown and traverses the road and the rails to Texas.  If you've read the book, you'll find the inspiration behind this album.  Both are gripping and excellent.
B00006V9A0|2.0|What a drain.<BR> This cd, despite its potential, is a pointless desecration of everything the band stood for during its reign over punk/grunge music in the early 90's. Kurt Cobain, the lead singer, writer, and guitarist of the band who took his own life in '94, fought his entire life to debunk rumors of his \\"selling out\\" and refused to fall into the sink hole of commericial merchandising. <BR> This compiliation cd, a hit-mix headlined by the unreleased \\"You Know Your Right\\" (previously titled \\"Up On the Mountain\\") is simply a way to suck money from \\"fans\\" who know little about the band's ideals and/or are too lazy to enjoy the entire experience of all Nirvana has to offer.<BR> This is just the record companies and Courtney Love, Cobain's bitter widow and lead singer of Hole, trying to shove a few more dollar bills into their wallets. <BR> So many amazing songs have been left off this c.d. What about power-vocals in \\"School\\" off Bleach, \\"Frances Farmer's Revenge on Seattle\\" from In Utero, or Kurt's rare \\"Opinion\\" or any other of the great B-sides and little known rarites hiding out there. <BR> This cd is very disappointing. While all the tracks included are great, we've all heard them a million times, and there are so many unplayed songs that should get out to the fans.<BR> Anyone interested in buying this cd should do themselves a favor. Download \\"You know you're Right\\" and instead of this cd, pick up one of the unreleased Outcesticide albums off ebay which are packed with songs the majority of nirvana fans have never heard of.<BR>Unless of course, you're an insane collector like me... in which case, get both!

B00005JLRR|4.0|First, I have actually seen this movie in theatrical release. This review is not based on film clips from trailers or on speculation or fantasy. Second, I am a huge Star Trek: The Next Generation fan, both the TV series and the movies. Third, I am a great fan of Patrick Stewart. As my rating indicates, this is a very good movie (although I don't think that it is the equal of some of the best episodes in the TV series). And just as importantly, it encompasses the sense of adventure concerning the unknown, the unconquerable optimism of humanity, and the examination of human nature itself that has made the Star Trek franchise so durable.<br />The cast includes all the major characters from the long running series: Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart), William Riker (Jonathan Frakes), Data (Brent Spiner, who also plays Data's \\"brother\\"), Geordi La Forge (LeVar Burton), Worf (Michael Dorn), Deanna Troi ( Marina Sirtis), Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden), and introduces Shinzon (Tom Hardy) and his Reman Viceroy (Ron Perlman).<br />During preparation for the wedding of Riker and Counselor Troi (yes, at long last), the Enterprise is diverted from its journey to Betazed by unidentified signals from the planet Kolarus III.  They discover that these are emanating from parts of an android including a severed head which is identical in appearance to Data. After a wonderful chase and escape scene they are requested by now Admiral Janeway (Kate Mulgrew in a cameo appearance) to divert their course to Romulus and act as federation ambassadors to the new government. The head of the government is Shinzon, who is a younger clone of Picard. The Romulans had initially planned to secretly attempt to replace Picard with Shinzon in order to subvert the Federation from within; when the plan was abandoned he was exiled to Remus and saved from death by his Viceroy. <br />Shinzon claims that due to his human heritage but Reman upbringing, as the leader of Romulus he can be the link to broker a peace between the Federation and its enemies. Soon, however an intricate plot is discovered involving Shinzon's attempt to renew his failing health while planning the complete annihilation of earth. While the details are very elaborate, the basic story line becomes the continual struggle of good versus evil. And, of course, the interest is heightened because both Picard and Data engage in detailed introspection and self analysis in order to decide what makes them uniquely who they are and how they should deal with \\"their other selves\\". As you may guess, while the conclusion is ultimately uplifting as the human spirit and the ingenuity of Picard triumph and the earth and humankind are saved, it is not without considerable cost, including the willing sacrifice and complete annihilation of one of our old friends . <br />The final battle scene is very long and more in keeping with the action adventure nature and special effects of the movies than of the TV series, but does have some spectacular sequences during the final moments. I enjoyed the movie a great deal, and believe that it compares favorably with most of the other movies in the series. If the current intentions of Paramount to make this the final episode in The Next Generation serires are not altered, this is certainly a fitting way to remember these old friends, but they will be missed.
B00005JL96|5.0|Great film -- fun -- but with an underlying darkness that is a bit disconcerting, though thought provoking as well.  Not a problem for kids--they won't see the shadows--

B00003CXXO|5.0|It's interesting how artistic vision is often met with ambivalence, controversy, and confusion when first presented to the public.  &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; flopped when it was actually playing in the theaters, Led Zeppelin was initially reviled by the critics, and &quot;The Exorcist&quot; received as many bad reviews as good.  Now all are universally considered the pinnacles of their genres, and to criticize them only makes the critic appear ignorant.<br />I suspect &quot;A.I.-Artificial Intelligence&quot; may be the current example of this tendency.  Some people call it brilliant, whereas others scoff at it.  While I admit I'm biased (I loved nearly every minute of A.I.), I suspect that much of the negative reaction against A.I. is simply a defense mechanism to mask an uneasy feeling often generated by things which don't quite fit the expected pattern or the current spirit of the times. <br />It was interesting reading the review which analyzed the &quot;three acts&quot; of A.I.  The reviewer mentions characters which don't seem to fit (Jude Law), voices of toys which are too grandfatherly (Teddy), changes in mood (third act) and music (second act).  With all due respect to the author (who obviously put a lot of time and thought into his excellent and well-written review), it seems to me that the author's real problem with A.I. is that he doesn't like discordant elements.  After reading it, I found myself wanting to respond &quot;But I think the odd characters (Jude Law), unexpected voice tones (Teddy), changes in mood (third act), etc. make the movie more interesting and rich.&quot;   <br />In any case, the fact that over 2000 people have written reviews suggests that &quot;A.I.&quot; is generating strong feelings in its audience.  Some of us were deeply moved by David's quest, whereas others were distracted and annoyed.  Many viewers were somewhere in the middle...loving parts of the film and disliking others.  As for me, I was deeply moved and stimulated.  I thought alot about some big, important, and disturbing questions after seeing A.I., and for that reason alone I'd recommend it to anybody.  However, I don't know if it's a great film.  I believe &quot;A.I.&quot; may be the type of art that will require the passage of time in order to be properly evaluated.  I wouldn't be surprised if in 20 years, it is considered a classic.
0876855575|5.0|I consider Charles Bukowski to be American's greatest writer. And I consider \\"Ham on Rye\\" to be his best book.  Well, its my favorite.  I could go on and on about how great Bukowski is, but you probably already know that (and if you don't then theres no helping you).  So instead I'll say: If you like Bukowski's writing you might like my new book, \\"SURVIVING ON THE STREETS: How TO GO Down Without Going Out\\" by me, Ace Backwords.  Check out the amazon.com site for what the critics have to say about it. You can hate me for sneaking in this unsolicited plug, but hell, I'm on the streets and need to hustle up my next beer money anyway I can.  I'm sure ole Buk wouldn't mind.  -- Ace Backwords ...
B000002C4J|4.0|I think I must be biased by having listened to too many concept albums. As I listened to this Celine Dion CD, I thought it was a bit uneven. Not in quality, her voice is incredible. Very few pop singers can sing with the range of Celine. However, the range of styles was a bit extreme for me.<br />Let's talk about the extremes. On one end, we have a couple of duets with Luciano Pavarotti and Barbra Streisand. These songs fall very solidly into easy listening or light pop. Two great singers teaming up with another great singer.<br />Slightly to one side of this extreme is \\"My Heart Will Go On\\", from the movie \\"Titanic\\". I admit that I'm hooked on this song. The list of pop artists that could have pulled this song off is very, very short. The range of her vocal performance, the music backing the performance, the lyrics, simple but effective, create a phenomenal song well-deserving of the awards and praise it received.<br />Another song similar to these is \\"To Love You More\\", another beautiful song making full use of that lovely voice. Everything to like about this song.<br />A few songs just do not seem to fit into this CD. The worst is \\"Treat Her like a Lady\\". I could see Lil Bowwow or a number of other artists doing this one, but this song just doesn't fit into Celine's style, or the style of the rest of this album. This song is a speed bump on this album that just doesn't match, and I cringe every time the CD player hits it (yes, I keep forgetting to program around it). Note that I have no complaints with Celine's singing. Celine could sing anything well. It's just that it's not her style. Having Celine sing this song is like Eminem singing Partridge Family songs; he may do a good job, but is that really what he's all about? In addition, portions of some songs reminded me of Diana Krall. There were places where there was a faint hint of country.<br />Would I recommend this album to a Celine Dion fan? Absolutely. There is a lot of good material here. Her singing is at least good, and generally great. There are a number of really good songs. Would I recommend this album to a casual Celine fan? It depends on the tastes of that fan. If you can enjoy having a duet Barbra Streisand on the same album as a strongly modern R&B song, along with faint whiffs of country and occasionally forays into Diana Krall's style of music, then the answer is yes. For all others, I recommend getting a \\"best of\\" CD that includes \\"My Heart Will Go On\\" and \\"To Love You More\\".t least good, and generally great. There are a number of really good songs.

B000066NW0|2.0|Punk is dead because of Avril Lavigne.  She sings songs that sound nothing like punk and now the MTV viewers think punk rock is \\"Sk8ter Boy\\".

If you want to hear real punk try the sex pistols of ramones not avril.
B00004U8H4|5.0|When this movie came out in April of 2000, I didn't have any expectations. My friends and I were talking about this movie a couple months before it came out. We thought this was going to be the best movie since Stanley Kubricks A Clock Work Orange. With the title of this movie already disturbing, American Psycho guaranteed to horrify and disturb the audience; I couldn't wait to see it. I really enjoyed this movie because I am really into this genre of dark and twisted movies. It also showed us a person trying to find himself in the New York City society, and a great view of the eighties.    <BR>     The main characters are Christen Bale as Patrick Bateman, Reese Witherspoon as Evelyn Williams who is Patrick's fianc. The story is very hard to follow, abstract and extremely dark. The movie is about a good-looking pretty boy, Patrick Bateman, who has everything going for him with a great job, lots of cash, a hot girlfriend and even a hotter mistress. The only thing lacking in his world is any appearance of a soul. In his own words, he just \\"doesn't exist\\". Patrick has many hobbies: He loves music, going to clubs, charming the ladies, cocaine and of course killing, Mutilating and beating innocent people for the shear joy of watching them bleed. His lust for blood gets stronger and his sanity slowly slips away, that is what drives him to kill.<BR>      I really enjoyed this movie from start to finish.  I really be keen on these weird twisted, dark movies because it keeps me entertained and usually laughing throughout the whole movie. This is one of the best horror movie I have seen in a while. I don't know why I am into these dark and twisted movies, I just am. I love the way they just bluntly show the gore and violence without masking it at all. The way they portrayed his life is perfect in everyway, to everyone's eyes but his own. Through his eyes, his life seems boring and nothing can excite him anymore, except to kill someone and then paint it. In his eyes, blood, gore and death are beautiful. This is why this movie gave great visuals to the dark and twisted part of it.   <BR>      This movie is based on true story of a man trying to find him self in the high-class New York City society. When he finds himself, he figures out that, to be in this society is absolutely boring. The only way to stay sane in his eyes is listen to great eighties music artist like Huey Lewis and the News and to kill people for no reason. In this society, people rate you on what you wear, where you can get reservations and how good your personal business card is. For example, the main character, Christen Bale brutally killed his co-worker just because he had a better business card then him. This movie puts you on a dark and twisted search trying to find who the \\"real\\" Patrick Bateman is. <BR>      This movie also gives a great representation of life in the eighties and how money isn't everything but everybody thinks it is. In the eighties in New York City, it was all about where you ate, who you hung out with, and what drugs you did. Back then, the drug of choice was cocaine. In the eighties, cocaine ran ramped and you could purchase in almost any bar or restaurant. During this time, the crime rate skyrocketed and prostitution was big thing during this time. This movie gave great visuals of the eighties. It really focused on what people thought about each other. Everybody thought that money was very important, but people threw it away like old leftovers. This movie gave in depth examples of all these things.<BR>      This movie is either a love it or hate it type of movie. You might get it or you might not. If you do get it you will go for a 2-hour roller coaster ride of horror, gore and little comedy.  This movie gave a great story of a man trying to find himself in the New York City society and when he did he didn't really care for it. This movie also gave a great description of the eighties in New York city.  In conclusion, I really enjoyed watchingthis movie and I still enjoy watching this movie. Over and over again. I hope after reading my review you will go and watch this movie and like it as much as I do.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|I've recently gotten into the man in black pretty heavily.  While his older stuff is generally excellent and personal, it doesn't compare to the quality of this recording.  The sound staging (if you close your eyes you can see the band and point to each part in the space around your speakers) is EXCELLENT.  It's a VERY personal feel, even for a Cash album.  He's really on top of the mic and it sounds like he's right in front of you.  It was recorded in a chuch, which also made for some great acoustics and makes the recording seem &quot;big&quot; and &quot;open&quot;.  You can really hear the echos on certain songs (like &quot;First time I ever saw your face&quot;)<br />Does some pretty interesting covers, from Nine Inch Nails (&quot;hurt&quot;) to Depeche Mode (&quot;personal Jesus&quot;) to many others.<br />It's a very moving album.  His age really comes through in his voice.  The insert also has pictures of him... one of which is a closeup of his hand (presumably), wrinkled and old, on his guitar.  Most songs have a somber tone.  Not many &quot;upbeat numbers&quot;, but overall a VERY quality recording.  I would definitely recommend.

We learn that Heaven and Earth are very much the same.  As time goes on, we grow smarter, learn more...our heavens expand as our world does, we gain wisdom from experience, and even though we are happy, the things we want -- both in heaven and on earth -- are not attainable.  <BR>well...a minor &quot;experience&quot; that the main character has at the end defies the message of the book, which was enjoyable until that point.

This album is a Stereo and sampling feast appreciated best with headphones, loud. Among the highlights are &quot;Something to do&quot; - a brill social statement reflecting small town angst as well as &quot;Blasphemous Rumours&quot; (quite contreversial at the time,we have come a long way since then)Also love the lyric on &quot;Stories of old&quot;, simple and strong.<BR>Martin sings two songs on the album &quot;It doesnt matter&quot; being my favourite.<BR>Highly recommended for fans of old and new. A true original as only the Modes can muster.
0395389496|5.0|While browsing in a bookstore last December, I stopped in front of a stack of Polar Express books, and picked one up.  A lady passing by me with her 10 year old son stopped and asked if I had read it, I said no.  The woman held my arm and said &quot;You have to buy it, it is the most wonderful Christmas story my children have ever owned, you just HAVE to get it!&quot;  Her son agreed, and they'd had it for years!  She went on for some time and was so emotional and insistent, that I promised to buy it.  In fact, I was so intrigued by her response to the book that I sat there and read it after she walked away.  I was moved to tears at the end, scooped up two copies and a gift set that included an ornament and the cd with the story told by Liam Neeson (sp?).  It was a cherished gift to friends and my own 3 and 5 yr old boys.  I'm buying it this year for my nephews.  She was right.
0006531407|5.0|This survival book is rivaled by few others. It covers basically everything you would need to know should you find yourself out in the wilds without help from civilization. The color illustrations are a great reference and the book also includes some useful information on coping with domestic survival situations. The main drawback to the book is that for Americans (like me) it is written in British style English using many vocabulary words which most folks who learned American English would have a hard time with. Of course, this is understandable given that the author is British and served with Britian's SAS. There are certain areas which could use some more thorough explaining, atlhough for its length, this book is pretty detailed. All in all, it is worth every penny, baht or pound you would spend on it and should be read by anybody who ventures outdoors. Not only is it informative, but it's also entertaining as the author does throw in some humor of his own. My hat is off to to the author! A great book!
0767817729|5.0|I truly cannot believe how people can think this movie is not good.  It is the best Costner movie I've seen to date.  The story is classical in tone and nature.  It's instinctive and beautifully filmed by Tony Scott.  It hits several emotional chords.  Friendship, love, honor, duty, and last but not least, revenge.  I would say that the movie should not have been titled, \\"Revenge\\", as it suggests that's what the movie is all about.  The movie is about a divorced Vietnam vet who decides to 'get out' and take it one day at a time.  He is trying to collect himself and understand his life when he falls for a very beautiful woman (entirely plausable). The scene where they make love in the coat room is the steamiest scene on film.  It's beautiful.  The whole movie is beautifully filmed.  Costner's depth of character is immense.  His acting range is diverse.  The only bad thing I can say about the movie is that it is not LONG enough.  Sometimes the scenes jump around a bit without explanation.  That is the only weakness in the film.  It's a Great Tragic Love Story in every sense of the word.
B000003N7K|5.0|My love for jazz practically began with this album when my then-boyfriend gave me the CD as a part of Valentine's Day gift set seven years ago. He said a music store clerk recommend the CD when he asked for romantic music. Well, my thanks go out to that music store clerk because I simply adore this album. I've bought more than fifty jazz CDs since then but this one remains as one of my favorites still. Johnny Hartman's voice is that of thirty-year Port: sweet, suave, seductive, smooth, and just as effective. When it's dark and rainy, light up a candle, pour some wine and listen to this album. John Coltrane's tenor sax and Johnny Hartman's vocal will surround you in a musical cocoon of love and longing.
B0000640SA|5.0|Before Christopher Nolan would be tapped to direct a remake of 2002's Insomnia, he directed this modest budgeted thriller that sets bold new standards in mystery and suspense cinema.  Guy Pearce (Ravenous) plays a man named Leonard Shelby who is searching for the man that raped and murdered his wife.  That alone is pretty much the plot, but what sets Memento apart from other revenge themed thrillers is the fact that the film moves backwards event wise.  The film starts out from the end and works it's way back to the beginning, letting the viewer find out not just how something happened, but why it happened.  Memento is presented in this form due to the fact that Leonard suffers from a condition received when his wife was attacked that stops his brain from making new memories.  Lenny can't remember faces, names, locations, or anything else on his own so he takes Polaroid photos, writes endless amounts of organized notes, and even makes himself home made tattoos.  Pearce is simply unbelieveable in his role as the tortured soul Lenny, while Joe Pantoliano (The Matrix, tv's The Sopranos) almost steals Pearce's thunder as Teddy, a man who may or may not be on Lenny's side.  Carrie-Anne Moss (another Matrix alumnus) plays a sympathetic soul to Lenny's crisis while hiding ulterior motives, and she gives a knockout performance as well.  Memento requires more than one viewing to fully understand the complex storyline, but once you do you'll be left with your jaw on the floor.  All in all, those looking for something delightfully different and intelligent should definitely give Memento a well deserved look.
B000003RCY|5.0|It's amazing that with a standout debut album like this, Rammstein has been able to match it with Sehnsucht and Mutter. This is undoubtedly the best pure metal band of all time. Only a more eclectic mix like the Pumpkins or Marilyn Manson can match them and only the incomparable NIN exceeds. There are no standout songs on this CD since they are all great. The grating repetition that plagues virtually all metal bands is totally absent in Rammstein. It can only be attributed to genius. Also, repeated playings of this and their other two CDs only enhance enjoyment of this incredible music. <BR>Interestingly, none of my German business associates like Rammstein, but then they can understand what they are saying!
B000002I4S|5.0|Although I am now 58 and have been a casual jazz fan for 40 years, I only purchased my first Coltrane CD a year ago. Now I have five, of which &quot;Giant Steps&quot; is the most recent. Every one of them is excellent, and this one may be the best of them all. At the moment I write this, 68 other reviews of this disc are available, many by musicians, or by people who know more about WHY this is outstanding than I do, even though they may not have been born when it was made. All I know is that it is addictive, happy, glorious and uplifting. Remember in the film  &quot;Amadeus&quot; when the Emperor, played by Jeffrey Jones, tells Mozart that something seems wrong with his new composition? The Emperor doesn't exactly know the problem, but perhaps the work &quot;has too many notes.&quot; One might say that at times about Coltrane, but like Mozart, the dude knew where to stick 'em. I expected this disc to be good because before I bought it I read all those prior reviews, but this good? Mr. Coltrane has given me a lot of pleasant hours over the past 12 months. I was alive when his work was new, but not sophisticated enough to get the most out of it. I guess I've finally grown up!
B00006RU5B|4.0|mostly because of tom morello and chris conwell, many of the songs are at least half-way decent.  the pounding riffs of morello and the singing of conwell seems to help establish an unique type of sound of this group that is different than many of todays bands and makes these songs sound almost classic.<BR>your preference of what kind of music you like will help you decide for yourself if you like it or not.
B00005JLF5|5.0|DS9 is hands down the best Star Trek Series of all time. It is incredible that the quality of Voyager followed AFTER DS9. The stagnant generic characters of Voyager are completely opposite to the beautiful character developement of Deep Space 9. I am counting the days until I receive this DVD set. I recommend this purchase to any who even remotely enjoy Star Trek. Each season is better than the last!
B000021YQV|5.0|This album is System's best so far. It has some wicked tracks on (two of my favourites being Toxicity and Chop Suey). It is absolutley fantastic to listen to after a hard day, and you really can feel the pleasure the band get out of doing what they do. Amazing. If it wasn't rated out of 5, I'd give it 9 3/4 out of 10. Simply cuz I never give anything 10 out of 10. A must-have for any rock fan. Buy it! Now! Your life will be sooo much better if you do.<BR>Charlie Lindley
B00006JJ1O|5.0|Yes, we're all sick of gimmicky corporate plans to have us buy cds, and yes we almost always fall for them.  I bought the TATU cd and...well....I actually loved it.  If you've seen Britney or Christina lately, then these two Russian girls shouldn't shock you.  The music is awesome and the blend of the vocals works very well with it all throughout the cd.  I especially enjoyed the Russian versions of some of their songs.  Basically, it was put together very well and I'll look forward to their next cd.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|One word for this album would be, amazing. 200 km/h in the wrong lane rocks, and there first single, All the things she said has a total pop/dance beat, My favorite song would have to be 30 min though. This song has the best lyrics and relates to me the most. Everyone should check this out!
0375414053|5.0|I Don't Know How She Does It is a compelling and poignant novel about Kate Reddy, a working mother who struggles to balance her professional and domestic responsibilities. Kate loves her husband and two children, but she also has a demanding career as a fund manager for a large trading firm. Luckily, she has the benefit of a very caring husband by her side. Unfortunately, he has felt neglected and his patience is running out. Is taking the traditional role of housewife and quitting her high-maintenance job the politically correct thing to do? The feminist references aren't lost on me, and Pearson addresses said issues brilliantly.<br />This book ought to be devoured from cover to cover. Buy this book for every woman you know. This is the sort of book that everyone could relate to...

B000000W5B|4.0|For some reason, this album became one of my top five favorites over the years.  Maybe it's because Soup is the kind of album made for a rainy day or a blue mood.  Maybe it's because the Stones tried to do something very different with this record- a direction they would abandon for the Stones-by-rote of It's Only Rock n' Roll the following year.  Maybe it's because of the bad reviews the album got, including one mag calling it &quot;a criminal waste of vinyl&quot;.  Probably it's for all of these reasons that I love it.<br />Unfortunately, this album marks the break down of the rich collaboration with producer Jimmy Miller as well as the now-plainly obvious disintegration of the mighty Keith.  However, the songs are still good and worth a listen.  100 Years Ago, though a song dating from 1969 (they played this at Hyde Park), is a great track as is the classic tag line &quot;don't you think it's sometimes wise not to grow up&quot;.  Heartbreaker is killer Stones.  Angie deserves all the hype it got then and now.  Silver Train is a reassuring reminder of the kind of music the Stones normally made.  Winter is just a hearty dose of melancholy and typifies the sadness that pervades this record.  I could live without Star Star and a couple of other tracks, but the album is well worth a listen for Stones fans, casual or fanatic.  It's a dose of the Stones as glam band at their most befuddled and confused, but the results are memorable.  Enjoy...
0151008116|3.0|I qualify this book as a 'Chinese Dinner Book:<BR>  I know I've read a book, I just don't feel like I've read a book.  <br />The premise of the book was very interesting, and it was full of vivid detail and the right mix of fact and whimsy.  I found myself loving the character of Pi, as really feeling a sense of understanding this character because we journey with him during this growth.<br />That being said...there were a lot of times I felt this was a very disjointed novel, and the story sometimes let my mind wander...which isn't good for a novel.  By the time I finished, it was like 'OK...I know a character...but what's the story?'<br />I can't recommend this unless you have an airtight attention span.
B00007E8O5|5.0|A 2 disc release that includes all the songs from the original release of Degredation Trip.  None of the new songs let me down wich is hard to imagine after how much I enjoyed the first release.  with the song Pig Charmer he indeed saved the best for the 2 disk set this is an instant classic in my book and will probably not leave my CD player for a long time.  Jerry Cantrell has proven he can produce great music even out of the shadow of his former band Alice in Chains.  <BR>best rock/metal album of the year easily.
B000002JSN|5.0|My first copy of Physical Graffiti came in the form of two tapes my friend Chris gave me after one of his regular trips to the United Arab Emirates to visit his dad during high school summer vacation.  Back then, pirated tapes of many western albums were available in the U.A.E. for a pittance and Chris was more than happy to snatch them up.  A generous sort, Chris often gave me several of his new acquisitions at the end of each summer.  <br />While Chris was in the U.A.E., it was my job to make the 20-minute drive out to his moms house in Lightfoot and worry after their yard and the burly cat that patrolled it.  On the way to Lightfoot, it was not uncommon for me to blast my Physical Graffiti tapes from the speakers of my parents Reliant K.  Windows down, Custard Pie blared as I sped down the Colonial Parkway.  Then, The Rover escaped for all to hear as I zoomed past Pierces Pitt Bar-B-Que.  Up the deserted country road that served as a drag racing strip for many a testosterone-fueled teen, In My Time of Dying prodded me to drive ever faster.<br />Eventually, Id arrive at Chris moms place where it would be time to get my yard work on.  Even while mowing, Id still hear the songs in my head over the cacophony produced by the mowers busy blades.  Oh, my Jesuh. Oh, my Jesuh.  Robert Plant sure could testify even if his heart seemed to be more inclined towards the Eastern faiths.  And I sure could mow some lawn.  In less than an hour, the grass would be back down to a sensible height and Id already be inside the house preparing a tall cool one.  Lemonade, of course.  Once refreshed, Id retire to the living room where Chris family kept their most cherished books and movies.  Whats this?  A homemade videotape of U2s Live from Red Rocks.  No one will miss it if I borrow it for a few weeks.  And so it went.  To be honest, I never borrowed much and I always returned what I borrowed.  So whats thebig deal?<br />It really wasnt a big deal.  But if you think Physical Graffiti isnt a big deal either, you may want to see a competent mental health care professional.  Physical Graffiti is Led Zeppelins most varied, challenging, and, yes, self-indulgent album, yet somehow they pull it off.  It is composed of two discs that are striking in their Botvinnik-ian ability to achieve the aim nearly every time.  Hey, theres a reason Led Zeppelin are firmly entrenched in the rock music pantheon.<br />To fully appreciate Physical Graffiti, it is important to have some historical perspective on Led Zeppelin.  By the time they released the genre-hopping classic, Physical Graffiti, Led Zeppelin had already made two electric blues albums (Led Zeppelin I and II), one hard folk album (Led Zeppelin III), and two hard rock albums (Led Zeppelin IV and Houses of the Holy).  Producing classic single albums was obviously alarmingly easy for Led Zeppelin.  After awhile, the only challenge left became to create a comparably great double album.  Led Zeppelin werent the first legendary band to try to transcend the confines of single albums and they wouldnt be the last.  By 1975, the Beatles and Stones had already weighed in with the White Album and Exile on Main Street, respectively.  Later, the Clash, Pink Floyd, Guns n Roses, Smashing Pumpkins, and Wilco would all follow suit by engaging in that ultimate act of artistic hubris, the creation of a double album.  Without question, Physical Graffiti is one the best double albums of all time, though it is surely not Zeppelins best album.  The near flawless Led Zeppelin II deserves that laurel.  Bringing Physical Graffiti down to mere classic status are the mind-numbingly repetitive radio hit, Trampled Underfoot, and the two subpar songs at the end of Disc 2, Black Country Woman and Sick Again.<br />Still, I hate to bring up these minor quibbles lest they serve to poison you against an album that belongs in the collection of any Led Zeppelin fan.  If you are new to Led Zeppelin, however, I recommend you start out with Led Zeppelin II, and once youve had your religious experience with that album, move on to the sprawling expanse that is Physical Graffiti.  Before you know it, youll be ready to slip those two discs into the CD player of your car and start heading for Lightfoot.
B00007BK2N|2.0|After hearing such positive buzz about \\"24 Hour Party People\\" I decided to give the film a chance without knowing anything about it.  Let me just tell you, I was bored to tears.  I like 80s music, I grew up in the 80s so obviusly I love it, but this is a horrible film, and it's only redeaming quality is the good music, which by the way is shown only in very breif segements.  Anyone that likes structure or a real story please avoid this film at all costs.

B00006JJ1O|5.0|T.A.T.U.'s debut with their crossover CD is something that I've been waiting for impatiently since the release of thier AWSOME SINGLE &quot;All The Things She Said&quot;.Since the first time I heard that song in my friend's car, I felt obligated to go out and buy the single to start with;we kept playing it on and on in the car singing along loudly. Then the CD came out, and it was amazing to hear all the different songs on it; the style of singing and the music is differen from all the recycled music that we get these days, T.A.T.U.'s music is totally refreshing; they have a very unique style of music (the way they play the guitars is great!!) and their voices are very beautiful, and the lyrics are wonderful. Buy this CD and dont hesitate, you won't regret it at all!!
0140177396|3.0|Of Mice and Men published in l937, is the tenth book written by John Steinbeck. Even though the book only covers a three-day span, it portrays the full spectrum of human emotions including physical pain, tenderness, friendship, pity, and jealousy. Steinbeck's sensitivity for the common man is evident in this work and the others produced during the 1930's. It has been claimed by many that this period saw Steinbeck's greatest works.  The social injustices of the 1930's are depicted in Of Mice and Men. His political concerns for equality and happiness for society is a major theme in this novel and his concern for the poor and below average is also evident.<BR>     The protagonists, George Milton and Lennie Smalls, are laborers looking for work on a small farm in Salinas Valley, California. Lennie, the bigger of the two, is mentally slow and this seems to always get him in trouble. George stays with Lennie to take care of him after his Aunt Clara died. They both had big dreams of owning a ranch. This is another one of Steinbeck's major themes, the search for the American Dream. However, for Lennie and George the American Dream, to buy the ranch and &quot;live off the fatta the land,&quot; is not achieved because of their limitations.<BR>     Slim, Curley, Curley's wife, Candy, and Crooks, the antagonists, work at the farm along with George and Lennie. This is where many conflicts happen, such as the fight between Lennie and Curley. The final conflict between George and Lennie at the river brings to reality the importance of friendship and the desperation of loneliness.<BR>     This novel is also famous because it depicts Steinbeck's well-known style of writing, which includes such literary devices as symbolism, irony, metaphors, parallelism, alliteration, and repetition. In the opening paragraph by repeating such words as, &quot;with the...&quot; the author easily moves from one repetition to another. Some of his descriptive sentences, like where he describes &quot;Thepath through the willows,&quot; have a rhythmic quality that adds poetic meaning to this novel. Another device Steinbeck uses is the simile. His phrase &quot;the rabbits sat as quietly as little gray sculptured stones&quot; is a striking example. <BR>     I really enjoyed reading Of Mice and Men, by John Steinbeck. Its down to earth humor shows compassion in a time where there was none. I really liked his characters and how they are developed in the story. They are believable and bring out the appropriate emotions in the reader. Steinbeck's use of simple plot, natural dialogue, and natural setting, makes this an easy and enjoyable book to read. This timeless classic is a book that I would recommend to anyone, for it is a story that withstands many readings by many generations.
0446677450|3.0|I think this book was interesting, and was very informative as to how one shouild invest their money. However, it could make you think you do not need an education to succeed which I disagree with. Even if someone succeeds or not they should be educated anyway. At least now we know there is another way to make money without education.
B00005JL78|3.0|Here's the formula for Minority Report. Take the sad, frigid ambiance that permeated Spielberg's last flop, A.I.  Add a \\"name\\" lead actor, Tom Cruise. Blend in a little action, not too much though. Borrow photographic techniques from highbrow horror films: shoot in chilly blue and white hues, blur the focus a bit. Shock the viewers with plenty of lurid clips suggestive of snuff videos. Finally, to keep the audience grounded, throw in some elements the masses can relate to: moralizing against technology, plus a whodunit plot twist. <br />The end result is an intelligent movie, very much in Stanley Kubrick style, but lacking the grandiose vision of Kubrick. What's left is a depressing, creepy, brutal, ultimately sad and very very lonely experience. The darker side of Spielberg is shining through in full force. Like a diamond lost in space, its light is cold and lifeless.
B00006L3S3|5.0|The record industry is leading us around the block like a dog on a leash, when we should be taking collective legal advice on the previous misrepresentation of goods. However, this is one of the most stunning examples of the benefits of &quot;remastered&quot; discs I have yet heard. A comparison of this release with the earlier CD would be the first piece of evidence I would use in court to recover some of my payments to EMI (now three for this one album - and watch out for the next trip round the block!). <br />So yes, I resent this abusive treatment of consumers, but when remastering sounds this much better I'll just have to put up with the dog-collar. Captive audience indeed.
B00003CXS4|5.0|Highly talented writer/director Guy Ritchie delivers another masterpiece with Snatch, that equals the sheer quality and genius of his other masterpiece, Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrells. Once again the film is edgy with vast undertones of dark, gritty realism centering on the underworld but refreshingly encapsulates a darkly humorous side to it making the film have an even balance and therefore making it more enjoyable and entertaining in the process. The film has a host of subplots all shrewdly linked to the main storyline and a wealth of characters including a couple of likeley Cockney lads who are two novice unlicensed boxing promotors, Turkish (Jason Statham) and Tommy (Stephen Graham), fellow boxing promotor Brick Top (Alan Ford), Mickey O'Neil played by Brad Pitt as an Irish gypsy who gets roped into the boxing match where his opposition is rigged to win, Avi (Dennis Farina) as the man due to deliver a stolen 86 carat diamond and Bullet Tooth Villain (Vinnie Jones) who Avi hires to trace the diamond after he is robbed. The characters and performances are superb and vastly convincing, the host of plots are well-structured and the attutude-laced dialogue rides along like a roller coaster. Snatch on the whole is an utterly compelling film that will grip your attention and not let it go until the film is completed. Essential viewing and the extra features on this DVD are an added bonus. Highly recommended!

B00000634J|4.0|John Lennon, like his Beatle counterparts, wrote and performed his best material when they were together.  However, for a collection of his best post-Beatle material, this album is pretty good.  In contains some of his best solo efforts, including &quot;Instant Karma,&quot; &quot;Imagine,&quot; &quot;Whatever Gets You Through The Night,&quot; &quot;Jealous Guy,&quot; and &quot;Give Peace a Chance.&quot;  Unfortunately, it also contains songs which showed Lennon reaching the end of his songwriting high.  The much played &quot;Happy Christmas&quot; sounds very similar to Peter, Paul, and Mary's &quot;Stewball.&quot;  The edge he had early on in the seventies was all but gone in his &quot;Double Fantasy&quot; tracks, exemplified most by &quot;Woman,&quot; a nice melody, but a song closer to his ex-partner, Paul McCartney in terms of softness.  Don't get me wrong - John Lennon is one of my favorite artists of the rock era.  I just think that his decline began about halfway through his solo career.  As for the listener from Cleveland, Ohio, suggesting the phoniness of songs such as &quot;Imagine,&quot; one must keep in mind that Lennon was a complex persona who suffered a great deal of psychological and emotional trauma through his tenure with the Beatles and beyond.  His music always reflected this, and his honesty is what has attracted listeners since &quot;Help.&quot;  Sure &quot;Imagine&quot; sounds naive, and in fact hypocritical, but Lennon was a man who was brutally honest.  For a better read into Lennon's mind, take a look at the now infamous biography &quot;The Lives of John Lennon&quot; by Albert Goldman.  It offers a different perspective into the complex individual.  As for the music, this CD serves as a great beginner for one of the most influential artists in music.  For a more complete portrait of his psychological state after the Beatles, check out his &quot;therapy&quot; album, &quot;Plastic Ono Band,&quot; perhaps the most brutally honest album recorded.  Peace...
0446677450|4.0|When I read the first chapter of the book I was very interested in reading on.  While the rest of the book was not as good (rather not what I expected) I still enjoyed it.  The book discussed fairly easy but amazingly true things.  These helpful hints are so obvious that the average Joe probably does not even think about them due to its simplicity.  While I think the concepts taught in the novel were a little hard to grasp for two nine year old boys, I personaly liked the style of the text and the information being presented
B0000028UK|5.0|Ten was probably one of the all time best grunge albums ever. Their next album, Vs., is more stylized than Ten. Vs is basically what Pearl Jam becomes over the next ten years. The guitar work is less screaching, and the vocals involve less screaming.<br />All that said, I still like Ten better. Vs was a let down for Ten fans looking for more of the same, but maybe keeping true to their grunge roots was impossible. Still, many of the songs on this album are classic - &quot;animal,&quot; &quot;dissident,&quot; &quot;elderly woman behind the counter in a small town,&quot; and &quot;daughter&quot; represent some of the best work ever done by pearl jam. This is a must-have for any fan of rock-and-roll
0446310786|4.0|We had to read To Kill a Mockingbird for 9th grade.  I was surprised at all of the allusions, and how deep the book actually went.  There are a lot of themes that don't jump out at you all at once, and you have to re-read it to find them.  I thought that this was a good book for high schoolers, but there are a couple remarks and ideas that aren't as great for middle schoolers to read.  This is a good book and should be thought of as a classic.

B00005JKZT|5.0|Have you spent much of the last year wondering about what to expect with The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers?  I have.  The first film dug itself under my skin and became as precious to me as the Ring is to Gollum.  Going for 364 days to see the next chapter has been grueling at times.  But (sigh) here I am.<br />(Begin Spoilers)<br />The film picks up with a flashback to Gandalf battling the Balrog on the bridge of Khazad-Dum.  We see it all over, except we see more of Gandalf's fall as he continues to fight the Balrog.  Frodo jerks awake suddenly, and we see we have been watching a dream.<br />The film wastes no time drawing the audience in.  Fans of the first film will certainly love this one, probably equally, maybe better.  The tone is a bit different, as the tone of the book was different than that of the first.  There are more discrepancies in the story here than there were in 'Fellowship,' and more liberties taken as a result.  Does this hurt the film? Not at all, as long as you're not a Tolkien purist.<br />The cast is once again great, with John Rhys Davies' Gimli having more to do, as well as his turn as the voice of Treebeard adding charm to the CG character.<br />Speaking of CG characters, Gollum is very impressive.  He's obviously CG-based, but the motion capture of actor Andy Serkis, as well as his grovelly voice, help to make a sympathetic character.<br />Karl Urban (Eomer), Bernard Hill (Theoden), Miranda Otto (Eowyn), Brad Dourif (Wormtongue), and David Wyndham (Faramir) are all approproately cast, with Hill and Otto giving the strongest performances among the newcomers.<br />Howard Shore's score is great, once again hitting in all the right places, and fitting the grand scale of the movie.  The Helm's Deep sequence is stunning, but there is much more to love in this film.  The re-introduction of Gandalf is a nicely done moment, as is Sean Astin's speech as Sam near the end.  The movie ends on an even bigger tease than the end of FOTR... leaving us salivating for Return of the King.<br />(End spoilers)<br />Is it perfect? No.  Will I see it again ASAP? Yes!

B00005JKQZ|4.0|After the Grinch I swore to myself never to see a Ron Howard film again. My brother dragged me to this one and I went with my arms folded across my chest. Not knowing what it was about, I found the mathematician moderatly interesting. I was not expecting the \\"twist\\" and it threw me for a loop. It is obvious Ron Howard has grown as a director in this film. It reminds me of Tom Hanks' career. For years he was known as the king of romantic comedy and now he is considered one of our greatest actors. But back then, who knew. I hope Howard takes chances like this in the future. Great story telling with a camera.<br />As far as the DVD goes, the shameless differentiation between the real Nash and Crowe's Nash are a bit off-putting, but are nonetheless an interesting feature. Instead of a speech given at the awards as in the movie, some old dame with a tiara puts a medal around his neck. The commentary is also good and Ron does goof on the fact that is brother Clint is only heard in a sound bite instead of seen as in most of his movies. Maybe that's why it got best picture.<br />Speaking of which, I am one of the few that actually can see the reasoning why A Beautiful Mind picked up a few oscars. Howard wins the Julia Roberts oscar. She won because she actually acted, he won because he actually directed. This is his best film since Appolo 13, which was a neat hat trick. It is a good movie with great acting and a phenomenal story. A great addition to any DVD library.
6303407188|4.0|A very offbeat movie indeed.  Johnny Depp is quite adept at portraying this astonishingly talentless film director. The oddball characters that Martin Landau and Bill Murray play are quite entertaining as well.  The black and white setting works well with the mood of the film.<br />The twists and turns that Depp encountes in getting this film releases are indded comical.  Although the formula tires just a little bit towards the end, the overall impression is a good one.  Worthy of a viewing.

0385484518|5.0|As a human being, I can appreciate this book, but as a nurse I was deeply moved.  I am faced with death and the dying process everyday, and this book allows me to view the \\"inevitable\\" as not such a definitive end.  Morrie's words and outlook on life and death are refreshing and inspiring.  I recommend this book to ANYONE, believe me, you'll love it!
B00007E8V4|5.0|Any System of a Down album is great, no matter when it is made.
6302293553|4.0|Probably the finest of the Monty Python troupe.  John Cleese and Michael Palin are at it again with the rest of the gang.  Their wild antics are outrageously entertaining.
B00006JJ1O|4.0|200 km/h in the wrong lane is, in my opinion, a great album. the single, &quot;all the things she said&quot; is great, with bangin electro beats and wonderful singing, these two girls are really amazing. A step up from our US pop acts, this is more smart electronic music than pop, with the pop singers to draw in the crowds and make it friendly to a non-electronic audience. they take a smiths song and make it better than the original. Their accents are just adorable, and you can feel the two girls closeness, whether they are really &quot;together&quot; or it is just rumours, it is obvious they are close. It would be nice if there were more songs, but the songs on the album definitely satisfy. I believe these girls are the future of pop: not only do they have catchy hooks and lyrics, but their electro beats appeal to the smarter, techno loving customer.
B0000048CP|5.0|This cd contains what is probably the GREATEST Black Metal song ever recorded! And that would be \\"A Fine Day To Die\\" following the incredible symphonic intro \\"Oden's Ride Through Nordland.\\"<BR>Not an exaggeration. It's that good. So all of you who think Cradle Of Filth is all there is to Black Metal (not that they're bad)or think that Mayhem and Darkthrone invented BM, do yourself a favor and pick this up. You'll love yourself for it.
B000001G7O|2.0|Anne-Sophie plays her violin with ultimate fury, the sound is forced and the interpretation forceful. Second movement is beautiful. Karajan is the worse accompanist conductor ever, the orchestra is all over the place. Tempi horribly slow. <BR>If you want Anne-Sophie Mutter, get Beethoven Violin Sonatas, just heaven. If you want the concerto, Zukerman with Mehta, perfect in all senses. If Karajan, get Beethoven ninth and all the romantic and german repertoire. But Tchaik, Mutter and Karajan together didn't rock whatsoever. Bah!
B00005NP04|5.0|I am a huge music fan &amp; love all types including contemporary country.  I knew of MM, but never really heard her music.  Then there was one miraculous day when I was flipping through the channels on my TV &amp; her video for \\"Where Would You Be\\" was playing on CMT.  I was completely captivated &amp; mesmerized by the song &amp; her voice.  I was completely infatuated &amp; that day MM acquired a new fan.  I went out that day, purchased her greatest hits album, &amp; fell in love with every song.  This CD inspired me to buy all her albums &amp; now I have a complete collection.  Her voice is so amazing &amp; Angelic.  I am so glad that at that moment in time I was provided the opportunity to hear her voice &amp; idolize her talent.  Even if you're not a country fan you will be infatuated with her.  She is an outstanding performer w/ a voice that gives you chills.
0671015206|4.0|I felt that this book was an eye opener for most of America's common people. MOst would have no idea that the rich can just be like you and me. I felt that Stanley and Danko had more than enough facts and the book got a little boring with all the specific stories that were told. I feel that the book had a good positive message about budgeting money and changing your way of life.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I love this CD.  It is so tranquil &amp; romantic.  The kind of CD you would listen to at a cocktail party or with candlelight.  Nora is an incredible talent &amp; her music is so relaxing &amp; refreshing.  I definitely recommend this CD for anyone.  Her sound will whisp you away.
B0000041Q3|5.0|This one is just gorgeous. I am totally speechless. For years during the sixties and seventies I heard Nilsson and Corelli on Met broadcasts and they were great.<BR>But this recording puts them to total shame. Corelli has heroic macho tone of a baritone with killer high notes that he holds and holds, and Nilsson always pierces the orchestra with no problem.<BR>But that is impressive, but not grand opera.<BR>This set, Sutherland/Pavorotti/Caballe will be remember as the milestone in the annals of opera.<BR>No need to go on and on. <BR>Sutherland's was in spectacular voice here, singing with passion and ease. Her velvety sound is incomparable. It is both huge and clear and heavenly. In my opinion, the most beautiful voice I've ever heard when she is in her prime as she is here. She attacks the notes with no sign of strain...in fact, the role seems easy for her. She has no rivals in the recording studio as Turandot. In fact, she sings a &quot;10&quot; Turandot, and the next best is Nilsson's 1960 version with Tebaldi, and in that, Nilsson is an &quot;8&quot; Turandot.<BR>Pavorotti is youthful sounding and sounds so in love with Turandot. The voice is a joy to hear. <BR>Caballe's Liu is the very best. She uses her impeccable bel canto technique to spin pianissimos that never in recent memory been duplicated. She is NOT quite the equal of Sutherland, no one is. But she is very close. My problem with caballe is the register breaks. But she way outsings Tebaldi and Scotto, and Price.<BR>This is a super recording. There will never be another better. So in my case, I bought 10. Just in case it gets discontinued and I can't get another. Buy it.
0380820846|5.0|This is the best Whistledown novel out!  Penelope, Eloise, Hyancinth, Felicity, Lady Bridgerton, and of course Colin make this book.  It makes you laugh, cry and laugh some more.  The characters really do come alive in this Julia Quinn novel.
0316666343|4.0|I wasn't thrilled with this book because I was hoping for a different ending and was disappointed. Also she jumped about 5 yrs down the road and I was confused for awhile, it was a good in that I couldn't put it down. I just wish it was a little better.
0446677450|3.0|This book was very informative and moved at a fast pace. I enjoyed it and found the way &quot;rich dad&quot; taught interesting. I might not agree with some of the ideas presented in this book, but it did open my eyes to the &quot;rat race&quot; that most everyone is stuck in. Overall it was a good book and i recommend it to people who want a short and fast read.
B00004XQP4|4.0|This album is awesome. I think a lot of music fans would agree that its probably their most ambitous alBum yet. I do think that its great but its not their best. Green day is at their best when they are playing their wreckless no holds barred pop-punk that we have all come to love. This album is great but they should ahve mixed it up a little bit more with more Green day type songs. Minority, Fashion Victim, Church on sunday and SEx ,booze, and blood are the only songs that are even close to Green day's signature sound. That's not sayin the rest of the album is bad. Warning is great,Macy's day parade is great, Jackass has some awesome lyrics and some people have told me that it is supposed to be about Blink 182. Castaway is an awesome song.Waiting is great, even the wierd song misery is pretty good. Thre are 2 songs on the album that are just horrible especially for green day standards, Hold on and Deadbeat holiday. These songs should be B-sides they just dont sound very good. People have said this album was inspired by the Beatles, Springstien , and Bob dylan. Those are great compliments but in those songs you just can see Billi Joe and the boys trying a little to hard to branch out. Just skip those songs and YOU'LL BE fine.
B00005JL96|5.0|I can't stand Disney's cartoons and I was dragged into this thing kicking and screaming. I came away with tears and a huge smile. This is an old fashioned good movie with good characters, warm story, humor, and action. I am glad someone still makes movies like this. Oh yeah, the animation is a joy to watch.
B00003CXCW|5.0|It may have taken a long time, but it was worth the wait.  This perfectly restored version must have be done frame by frame.  I have a 52&quot; television which is quite unforgiving with old or poor quality films, but this dvd was absolutely perfect- not a single scratch or mark has been left- I noticed masses of details that I'd never seen before, even when at the cinema.  <BR>I hope that the restored print will be released for cinemas too. Its not available in the UK yet, so is only good for people with chipped DVD's, but if you can play it, buy this now.<BR>A fitting tribute to one of the best films ever made.
0375414053|2.0|The book caught my attention with the early scene of Kate &quot;distressing&quot; a mince pie to make it look as if she made it.  I have done something similar with chili in the not too distant past. (HINT: 10 cans of Hormel + 1 chopped onion + 1 chopped jalepeno (sp) pepper = 1 well received &quot;homemade&quot; potluck contribution).  Unfortunately, I found myself wanting to shake her out of her competitive, self-absorbed circus.   The book dragged a bit in the last third and the ending was a major disappointment as well.   <br />Yet, as a working mom, there were some scenes that were classic.  I laughed til I cried when her daughter drew a picture of her with &quot;a lovely hat&quot; that turned out to be roots.  The description of the &quot;Muffia&quot; unfortunately rang true - although it seemed to me that the &quot;Muffia&quot; were merely stay-at-home Kates who were just competing in a different realm.  I guess my disappointment is due to the fact that I was hoping for someone a bit more of a kindred spirit and less of a person I hope that I am never like.
B00006JL1Z|2.0|Ok, first off, I am a huge Fleetwood Mac fan.  If these cd's were called &quot;The best of the new Fleetwood Mac&quot;, then fine.  But let's look at just some of the great Green/ Welch songs that are left off this collection:<br />Black Magic Woman, Rattlesnake Shake, Green Manalishi, Man of the World, Albatross, Need Your Love So Bad, Sandy Mary, Hypnotyzed, Sentimental Lady, Angel, Why, Jumping at Shadows, Oh Well, Heroes Are Hard to Find...<br />At least some of these songs should have been put on the album, or else it's just a bogus best-of Fleetwood Mac.  Don't get me wrong though, I love the newer lineup too, and I'm sure that these cd's are good   :-)     But it's just not really the best of Fleetwood Mac.
B000062X90|4.0|A wonderful cd, many fine tunes, and as im thinking what to write, i merely refresh my memory of their beautiful music, including live , live in memphis and phoenix . such tremendous<BR>talent, and its good they are still performing
B000069AUI|5.0|Ok - I never heard of these guys before (Parachute? - might have to pick that up.) - just heard the song &quot;In My Place&quot; a few times on the radio, liked it, and picked up the CD a few weeks later on a whim.  <br />I can honestly say it is the only cd that has been in my car CD player for the past week - nothing else has even had a chance.  I buy quite a bit of music, and have never written a review here before this, but have to say that these guys are definitely on par with the Verve, better than the Doves come on &quot;the Last Broadcast&quot;, and completely blow away U2's latest effort.  <br />Lead singer Chris Martin's vocals vacillate between a yowling Bono in &quot;The Scientist&quot; to the low level poetic rasp of a David Lowrey (of Cracker) on &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot;.  The guitar work also varies from melting into the background in &quot;In my Place&quot; to taking center stage, unplugged, in the folksy and very addicting &quot;Green Eyes&quot;.  <br />Definitely not your teenage rock anthem album, but if there is a special someone you would like to get to know better and you have somewhere to drive for 30 minutes, there is no better CD to have on to close the deal.
B00005JKZT|5.0|If you didn't like the first movie then don't go, because you won't like this movie.<br />I was worried because some reviewers were trashing this movie on television. I went with a friend and watched the movie at the Mall of Georgia on Dec. 17 11:59pm. Overall, I thought the movie was really good and actually better than the prequel, in my opinion.<br />There is a lot of action and really cool battle scenes. They have a lot of humor to relieve some of the tension. This movie is pretty long (3 hours). Typically, I don't get moved (swept up) by the movie. The sound and music in the movie is awesome. The special effects, acting, etc. are excellent. Contrary to rumors, the movie doesn't drag or lag action! The movie has a pretty fast pace. NOTE I'M NOT A FANATIC FOR LOTR SERIES.<br />Even if you have read the book, the movie will be entertaining and different but still true to books. What more could you ask for? By the way, the books are excellent. Surprise, Surprise! They are well written. The only problem is all the names and etc. can bog you down.<br />Back to the movie, the only controversial thing will about the trees. I'm nuetral on them. They didn't make or break it, so the movie was still great despite them. It works out better in a book than a movie.<br />Anyways, it a great movie. It's worth the admission price alone. My friend just watched both of them yesterday, and he said that he like them both and wanted to watch the third installment. Hope that helps.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|I heard 10 seconds of &quot;All the Things She Said&quot; on the radio, and immediately went to buy the CD.  I didn't regret it-- this is the best CD I've ever bought, and I haven't been able to stop listening to it.  The music is a mixture of pop and electronic rhythms, but there is such a depth to the lyrics that TATU is set far apart from bands such as *N Sync and Britney Spears.  The message of freedom and self-acceptance affected me very much, and there are even two songs in Russian, which are really fun to listen to.  TATU is officially my favorite band, and I strongly recommend buying the album, as you will be hearing a lot more about Lena and Julia in the near future.
B00005JL78|4.0|Perhaps I'm in the minority on this, but I find Minority Report to be one of the best adaptions of a Philip K. Dick story. It rivals Blade Runner but is just as flawed as that classic film. The flaws are primarily in the story department. There's enough holes in the plot to drive a car through and coincidences that reek of cheap storytelling. Despite this, the film is successful because of the premise, the basic plot, the well written characters and Spielberg's sure handed direction.<br />What's gratifying is the fact that Spielberg doesn't dumb down the basic story. The screenplay by Scott Frank and Jon Cohen isn't as interesting or sharp as one that might have been written by Harlan Ellison, but it still manages to be relatively faithful and stake out new territory.<br />The visual effects are stunning and the storytelling style is more akin to Kubrick than Spielberg. It's clear that Spielberg's collaboration with Kubrick has had an impact on his style. Unfortunately, Spielberg still feels compelled to wrap up everything neatly with a feel good ending. The film goes on too long by about 15 minutes. It really should have concluded after the showdown between Cruise and the bad guy.<br />Despite its flaws, Minority Report signals new maturity and depth for Spielberg as a film director. It's a powerful piece of work that hammers the message home a bit too hard, but still manages to capture your interest and imagination.<br />The DVD transfer is one of the best I've seen lately. The extras are nice and include a discussion with Cruise and Spielberg about the making of the film and their perception of its meaning. The archives section includes production concepts, photos and gives you a sense of the evolution of the film from script to screen. The section discussing the visual effects by ILM are interesting and show areas where they've broken new ground again.<br />The most important thing, though, is the story. It's well told and gives Dick credit (unlike Blade Runner which didn't credit Dick until the end of the film or Total Recall which used Dick's story as a starting place for a routine unimaginative action/adveture sci-fi flick)where it's due. I believe he would have been happy with the film as it ably reflects many of Dick's themes about the definition of self, paranoia and the flimsy nature of the reality around us.which didn't credit Dick until the end of the film or Total Recall which used Dick's story as a starting place for a routine unimaginative action/adveture sci-fi flick)where it's due.

B00005OM4N|4.0|Personally, I enjoyed this album more than the ...Baby One More Time and Oops...I Did it Again albums. Poor Britney has been picked on for the last 4 years and I'm starting to feel bad for her. I break from work is exactly what Britney needs as she recollects her thoughts and rethinks her path in the music industry. So far, Britney Spears has done a great job but she lacks the confidence that we see in most artists. Everybody is looking out for every slip-up Britney makes because she has reached ultra-stardom and that tends to happen to most celebrities at that rank. Britney needs to be sure of what she's doing and just be herself. She had no problem with singles like ...Baby One More Time, Sometimes, and From the Bottom of My Broken Heart. Most of the songs off of this album seem fake and don't make much sense. Britney has had the same image as the previous two albums but it's slowly getting skimpier and skimpier through the years. That's fine, but is that really her style. When I think of Louisina, I think of a cute, classy girl with natural looks instead of a freak with very little leather covering her private parts. To me, my only interest in Britney is her music. The tunes are catchy and her voice is cute but the words are meaningless. I broke down the album so that it is easily understood what Britney's strengths and weaknesses are. And here is my review of each song...<BR><br />Overprotected has a great beat to it and many teens can relate to the song. This is one of Britney's strengths. Taking the work of other peoples' music and making it her own. This song could be associated with Stronger and Crazy. I give it 5 stars!<br />I Love Rock 'n' Roll was o.k. I was expecting something more spectacular and I got a repetition of chorus throughout the song just like I Can't Get No Satisfaction and the Beat Goes On. It's just annoying. I'd give it 3 stars.<br />I'm not a girl, Not yet a Woman is an okay song that shows Britney's small range. I am a tenor and I couldsing this whole song and not change many octaves. It doesn't have any synthetic instruments like all her other songs. Unfortunately, it was the only ballad on the album so it doesn't show Britney as a diva very much. Not a Girl could be associated with Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know and From the Bottom of My Broken Heart. (Mostly due to it's long title) I give it 3 stars.<br />I'm a Slave 4 U was a single I personally enjoyed most. Besides You Drive Me Crazy Remix, it is the only single you can dance to. What is so great about it is, it's different and the sound is just great. Slave is nothing like Britney's debut singles Oops...I did it Again and ...Baby One More Time. I love it. It is one of my favorite tracks off the album. But the problem of lyrics is shown again in this track. I give it 4 stars.<br />Anticipating is o.k. It has a little bit of a Janet Jackson sound which is good, but it's boring for Britney. It is a fun song but I think Britney should stick to her own style. I give it 3 stars.<br />What it's like to be me! Well, I HATE it! It's horrible! It's so dull and it sounds like Justin and Britney didn't put much work into it. I am very disappointed with the work they did. It was a bad way to end the album. I give it a disappointed 2 stars.<br />Lonely is a song that when I heard the name at first I thought it would be a slower song like Lucky but to my surprise, when I heard the cool beat in the begining of the song I was surprised. I fell in love with the song. It's slightly identical to Don't Go Knockin' On My Door. I love the ending when the orchestra kicks in. Good work with this song Brit! I rate it a proud 5 stars.<br />Boys is pretty cool. It's right for Britney's age. Probably not for mine, but I still enjoyed it. It's kinda like I'm a slave 4 U. The beat is cool but what annoys me are the whispers you hear every time. They are so annoying if you are using headphones. I think their were to many but I still give the song 4 stars.<br />Let Me Be has that R&B sound that I enjoy it. The only thing is it's something you wouldn't expect from Britney, but from another artist. Kind of like Anticipating. It gets 3 stars.<br />Bombastic Love kind of reminds me of Britney when she first started out. It's kind of like a flashback song. Britney has gone a long way from ...Baby one more time to Britney. It 's great to remember all the great things she did. Now she's here and better than ever before. Even though this song doesn't seem like a great song I'm glad they put it on the album. Britney: Great Job! I give the song 5 stars for all your hard work!<br />That's where you take me is a fast song. Even though it doesn't seem it, it is! It's an o.k. song. Kind of like One Kiss From You and I'll Be There. I give it 3 stars. It wasn't anything special.<br />And Cinderella! Oh, this song is great! Like Lonely it is very emotional. I love to end the album with this song because the Orchestra really kicks in here. I give it 5 stars! Great work on this song Britney! <br />Great work on your album. And most of all, great work on your career. Britney gets a 3.5/5. Just remember to be yourself on the 4th album. I can't wait to see what you do next! Good Luck!

6301966562|5.0|I watched this movie for the first time in the late 80's and years later I can remember most of the memorable moments.  Just recently, I purchased the VCD (Video CD) of Electric Dreams from Singapore via eBay.  It may not be the DVD that I wanted originally, but it would of been much better than buying a second hand VHS rental.  If the DVD ever comes out, I will certainly add it to my 'old-school' collection.  Overall, a very entertaining movie, even if it is 15 years later.
B00005YW4H|5.0|when i first heard this cd i totally listened to the whole thing. How many cds can you buy and listen and love the whole cd. I play this cd everyday. i told co-workers that this cd is &quot;a make out cd&quot; little did i know tht two days later on the premier of &quot;maid in Manhattan&quot; they play two of her songs and one was for J. Lo make love scene... I know my music. Keep it up girl. Don't burn it, buy this cd.
B00005JKZT|5.0|The excitement in the air at 12:01 A.M., December 18, 2002 was rewarded with the best movie I have ever watched. I know that sounds a little far-fetched, but indeed, the movie at hand, The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, by far surpassed its predecessor, The Fellowship of the Ring, until this time my favorite movie.<br />For many reasons was this sequel excellent, but it comes down to three main things:<BR>1) It is based on the excellent work of J.R.R. Tolkien<BR>2) It expresses the themes of the book very well.<BR>3) It is more open, in my opinion, for the public.<br />1) Being hailed as the best book of the 20th Century, The Lord of the Rings has been often cited as the beginning of modern fantasy. Bringing its readers into a world which is, at the same time, fantastic and realistic, the story expresses themes of hope and faith as well as some really good characters. Thus, since the film is well-adapted to match the book in many ways (making a few adaptations to shorten the length as well as make the story flow better on the screen), it is excellent just as the book itself is excellent.<br />2) The themes of both hope (and hopelessness at times) are expressed well in this movie. Also, through cunning development of Gollum, the theme that good can prevail within a (seemingly) completely corrupt individual is expressly shown.<br />3) In my opinion, The Two Towers is more accessible to the public. Once you get past all the names in the movie, the plot is relatively easy to follow even if you have not read the books. However, the thing that lightens the mood, which is often needed for viewers who are not \\"hard-core\\" fantasy/Tolkien fans is the comic relief that is often inserted. The movie is often very dark, so the film is at some times extremely dreary. However, throughout the movie, there are other areas of light humor which help lighten the mood which often helps non-fanatics.<br />So in the end, The Two Towers gets 5 out of 5. I HIGHLY suggest seeing this movie!
B000002INJ|4.0|Ok plain and simple these guys are the true \\"kings of metal\\" this cd features not only some of the heaviest songs like hail and kill and wheels of fire but some truely great ballads like the crown and the ring and heart of steel. Eric Adams has one the greatest voice I've ever heard period. and Joey Demaio is the greatest bass player to grace gods green earth and your see this on Flight of the Bumblebee. Lest put it this way if you dont own any Manowar cds then your either [...]. even though there lyrics are all the same and are basically hillarious but they do state there point. Remember Hail and Kill and Keep listening to MANOWAR. ALSO CHECK OUT DREAM THEATER the best Progressive metal band period
B00005JKZT|5.0|I have just returned from a 12:01 am first screening of Peter Jackson's second installment in the Lord of the Rings Saga.  So how was it?<br />It is clear we are in the midst of a milestone of cinema.  The Two Towers is every bit as stunning, overwhelming, moving and spectacular as its predecessor -- while being a completely different movie altogether.  FOTR was an adventure movie infused with a sense of wonder and awe.  It's major theme was loyalty.  The Two Towers is a war epic with a much darker and more frantic tone.  If there is a theme, it is about courage and hope in the face of overwhelming evil.<br />(very minor spoilers ahead)<br />We start off right where FOTR left off -- the Fellowship scattered.  Merry and Pippin have been abducted by Orcs.  Gimli, Aragorn and Legolas are persuing.  Their journey puts them in the path of Saruman, who is massing an army at his fortress to attack the nation of Rohan -- one of the powers on the side of good. But Rohan's king Theoden is old and sick and can not resist. Meanwhile, Sam and Frodo continue their quest to destroy the Ring of Power with an unexpected ally -- Gollum, the pathetic creature that once owned the Ring for 500 years.<br />This is movie-making the way it should be -- grand, majestic, almost monstrous in its power.  The vistas are grand, the characters strong, the visuals stunning, the direction crisp, the dialogue splendid.  There's not a single bad line or bad scene.  And there are many that simply overpower the viewer.  I'm going to need to see this a second and third time just to take everything in.<br />Highlights?  The final 45 minutes, which feature three simultaneous battles, makes Star Wars 2 look like a kid's video game.  The character of Theoden, King of Rohan, is splendily realized in the script as a man who yearns for glory while fearing he is too old to achieve it.  He is magnificently acted by Bernard Hill.<br />But the highlight of this movie is Gollum -- a creature corrupted and twisted by the Ring, his psych split down the middle with both love and hatred for it.  In him, you see the creature Frodo might one day become.  His CG character is amazingly realized and powerfully acted by Andy Serkis -- who deserves an academy award for his portrayal.  As my girlfriend said:  This is Gollum's movie.<br />My principle objection to the movie?  It's too short.  It is rushed.  I can see another Special Edition coming.  And it's not followed immediately by Return of the King.<br />For those of you have read the book, the movie parts significantly from the text but not in any objectionable way and not in any manner that alters the storyline.  It ends a few chapters before the book.  And Tolkien's vision is amazing realized.  I thought that the Ents would be comical.  Instead, they looked amazing.  Through skillful combination of CGI, models and bluescreen work, this movie is a seamless and perfect rendering of middle Earth.
B00006SFBD|3.0|This album isn't quite the culmination of Opeth I thought it would be.  I'm not one of those fans who'll keep harping on the older stuff, and claim they sold out or what not.  I really liked Opeth's newer offerings.  Deliverance seems to fall WAY short of the standards they've set with My Arms Your Hearse, Still Life, and Blackwater Park.  There is a quite a lack of substance to this album and many parts get unnecessarily repetitive.  <br />I enjoy when I hear a band progress and evolve with time.  This album just doesn't seem to fit in with the natural progression of Opeth.  It just kind of, I dunno, exists.  It's quite a mediocre effort on their part.  Opeth are an incredible band, and I *KNOW* they're capable of putting out a better album than this.  I'll ALWAYS be a fan of Opeth.  They're quite a solid band, and I KNOW they're capable of better.  They've put out INCREDIBLE music.  First time I ever heard them, I had to go sit down after about 5-6 minutes into it because i couldn't believe what I was hearing.  Deliverance didn't do that to me, and hasn't yet.  I get the shivers when I hear their other albums, yet Deliverance bores me.  I've listened to the album a lot, and I still feel that it falls short.  The riffing sounds uninspired in parts, Wreath and Master's Apprentice for example.  Some sections are repeated too long and become drawn out.  It's not a bad album, but I expect a little more from Opeth.  I guess this is their first speed bump in the road of greatness.  After reading the studio log posted on their website, I can kind of understand why the album didn't turn out so good - technical difficulties and such getting in the way.  Apparently Steve Wilson and Fredrick Nordstrom were called in to salvage the album?  I guess if you listen to it and think of it as a rescue attempt, it's not so bad.  ;)<br />I'd advise ANYONE who hasn't heard Opeth yet, to buy Still Life first.  Still Life is a solid account of Opeth's brilliance.  Then go listen to the others.  Please don't pass judgement on them based on Deliverance.
0449000729|4.0|The only criticism I have of this book is that soon after I got  involved with a character's story and wanted to keep going, that era ended and I was two thousand years further on. That said, the book is an absorbing read. Rutherfurd is a good storyteller and it's an interesting learning experience too!

0553275976|5.0|Iam more than happy that I finally read the book, although I knew about it for a long time. during my free-time I read a lot and this book was a terrific read, one of the best books I ever picked up. <br />it is about the fall of sherman mccoy, a wall street 'wunderkind'. one night, he and his 'foxy love' take the wrong exit of the freeway and find themselves 'trapped' in the bronx. by accident, they hit a joung black male. the hit-and-run causes them unthinkable trouble and from now on, everything goes straight downhill. simultaneously, many other people take advantage of their doom. foremost, the journalist p. fallow and rev. bacon. the book is full of interesting, funny, but also bad characters (especially mccoy itself who is indescribably arrogant, the english journalist as well as the slimy, sycophant kramer and the 'influencial' rev. bacon to name but a few) and wolfe provides an excellent description of ny in the late 80's. however, due to the fact that iam german I do not know whether everything is true or a slightly exaggerated description. but I perosnally think it doesn't matter at all because the message is clear: in an achievement-oriented society everyone is only interested in her/his own benefits and 'walks over dead bodies' to reach more and more. of course, it is stereotyping but I safely assume that this is true and undenieable at least to a certain degree. <br />the bonfire of the vanities is a bitter-sweet, satiric, funny, dramatic, and enthralling novel everyone ought to read. maybe one of the finest american novels of recent times. what I liked most is the fact that there are no 'real heroes' and almost every character shows its dreadful, abhorrent side. of course, the book has its lenght but its worthwile to proceed because the pace is always high and so many amazing things occur although one might correctly guess what is supposed to happen next. <br />moreover, wolf's writing is great, in particular the different linguistic details in terms of dialects, abusive language etc. are absolutely fabulous. with a clear conscience, I highly recommend this book...
0066214122|5.0|Crichton's latest, a combination of scientific technology with fictional futuristic possibilities, is a thrill ride from start to finish.  Jack Forman, househusband, is looking for another job while taking care of his three children.  Wife Julia is a vice president at Xymos, where they are using nanotechnology, manufacturing molecule-sized devices, such as cameras, that can be inserted into the bloodstream to view all areas of the body. Convinced Julia is having an affair, Jack notices her tremendous mood swings and late working hours.  <br />    Hired as a consultant at Xymos to fix problems on a program that he designed, Jack travels to their manufacturing facility in the middle of the Nevada desert.  Switching identities from the neglected suspicious househusband, Jack suddenly becomes immersed in technology gone awry.  Lack of proper venting at the plant has caused particles to be released into the environment, where swarms are created and seem to be multiplying.  The technological aspects of this novel become more complex, adding depth to this read which increases in pace, thereby immersing the reader in Jack's fight to destroy the predatory swarms before they destroy him and others.  The plausibility of Crichton's nanotechnology transforms this brilliant novel from mere sci-fi into a frightening look at future technology.
0446677450|4.0|I'm not crazy, I promise. I wrote my &quot;Assets and Liabilities&quot; twice because of Robert T. Kiyosaki's writing style that happens to repete almost every important point he tries to make. As good as this book is, the ideas are drilled into our head several times within a few pages. But, overall this book was very educational and profound. Many people are in the &quot;rat race&quot; of life and are looking for a way to get out, this is the first step. This book helps me to conceptualize how I will spend my money once I start making it. I will put it into assets, so my &quot;money will work for me.&quot; This book gives an insight to a bunch of great ways to keep on top in the rich man's world

B000002IGV|5.0|I was 14 years old when this album came out and I was completely blown away by it at the time. 18 years later and it still rocks! This is one of those timeless metal albums that really needs to be in any true heavy metal/hard rock fan's collection. From the arena anthems like &quot;We're Not Gonna Take It&quot; and &quot;I Wanna Rock&quot; to the power driven songs like &quot;S.M.F.&quot; and &quot;Burn in Hell&quot;, and all the way to the power ballad, &quot;The Price&quot;, this album keeps you rocking the whole way. Is it cliche and campy? Sure it is, but the bottom line is that this is just straight up, good hard rock.
B000002UAU|3.0|For years Sgt. Pepper has been considered to be &quot;THE greatest album of all time&quot; by fans and critics alike. However, I believe that the time has come to re-appraise its true value in Rock history in context of 30 years of musical development since its release. Many have said this album cannot be bettered - I believe this statement to be entirely false.<br />Firstly, the praise. It cannot be denied that this album pioneered many of the production techniques used in music today, from compression, tight bottom end punch (achieved through Starr's drum kit tunings and McCartney's bass integration), reverb techniques (vocals through Leslie speaker cabinet, tape echo and delay on instruments) and the use of exotic instrumentation (sitars, tambura, swordmandel etc...). Equally, some of the sounds created for this record are genuinely innovative and still impressive today; the chopped-up and looped caliope and organ sounds on &quot;Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite&quot;; the indian instrumentation on &quot;Getting Better&quot;; the orchestral passages of &quot;A Day in the Life&quot;.<br />In terms of the songs, there are some genuine classics; &quot;With a Little Help From My Friends&quot; is a chirpy and well-integrated number which is perfectly produced and performed (unlike Joe Cocker's hideous interpretation); &quot;Being For The Benefit of Mr. Kite&quot; is an excellent piece of impressionism, even if it may be rather slight; &quot;Getting Better&quot; is an optimistic song with an insistent beat and a clever arrangement; &quot;When I'm 64&quot; shows McCartney's grasp of genre and &quot;A Day in the Life&quot; is still impressive today, although I take issue with the musicality of the orchestral passages.<br />The packaging is worthy of mention, for it introduced the same level of innovation and thought to the packaging of the music as with the actual manufacture of the music itself. The original sleeve was printed in colour, included full lyrics, some cardboard cut-outs and the fantastic Peter Blake front cover. All of this added to the perceived value and integration of the product and dramatically increased the scope for artistry in music.<br />Now, the criticisms. Despite the production and the presence of some excellent songs, there is no denying that the average number of pieces on this record is inferior to that on the predecessor, Revolver. Many of the songs are either repetitive (&quot;Good Morning, Good Morning&quot;), unintegrated(&quot;Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds&quot;), boring (&quot;Within you, Without you&quot;) or dispensable (&quot;Sgt Pepper Reprise&quot;). When compared to the album which inspired it, The Beach Boy's &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;, there can be no comparison between the songs. The pieces on this album have none of the sophistication of Wilson's masterpiece, nor do they have the intricacy of those on &quot;The Beatles&quot; or &quot;Abbey Road&quot;. The lyrics too, are largely trite and inferior to the average number on &quot;Revolver&quot;.<br />As an integrated concept, the album does not hold up at all. There is no consistency between the tracks aside from the first two and the final two. It fails to come close to it's original inspiration, in fact, it misses the point completely.<br />Furthermore, in terms of the claims that the album has never been bettered, The Beatles themselves bettered it several times over with their following albums and artists such as Queen, Tear for Fears and Genesis have released ambitious albums which have toppled this release.<br />In summing up, Sgt. Pepper is a good album which has great historical significance, but it is by no means a masterpiece and it is probably one of the most misunderstood and overrated albums released.
0440180295|4.0|This story, &quot;Slaughterhouse Five,&quot; has basically one character that Vonnegut hasn't removed from the story at one time of another.  &quot;Slaughterhouse Five,&quot; is however, filled with antagonists.  Valencia, his wife, has appeared throughout the story for brief moments in time.  The schoolteacher, Derby, has too been mentioned and appeared on numerous occasions in the book.  Kilgor Trout also is a character that is there, but not all of the time.<br />                The story takes place in many settings.  The main setting, however, is Dresden, Germany.  Throughout the story the narrator travels through time to many locations.  He could be in his hometown of Ilium one moment and then be whisked away to the far away planet of Tralfamadore.  He has been to the Swiss Alps and to Canada.  The story's setting changes many times, but always comes back to Germany.<br />                Kurt Vonnegut intends to convey the anti-war theme in &quot;Slaughterhouse Five,&quot; by showing the horror of war.  He does this by describing the Dresden fire bombing during World War Two.  Vonnegut uses many literary devices to convey his theme.  He definitely uses flashbacks through time.  He also repeats  one single phrase throught the story, he always says &quot;so it goes,&quot; right after or before someone dies.  Vonnegut does describe the war very well, and certainly conveys his ideas.  In my opinion this book was a little hard to read and to keep up with, but it was overall a fairly good book.
0385720920|5.0|In the past few years, I can't say I've picked up a novel I wasn't required to read in college. I loved the movie Fight Club, so I decided to check out another work by Chuck Palahniuk. This novel was so interesting, I could not put it down and had it finished in two days! Palahniuk dark humor and depiction of our most animal instincts was incredible. As dark as the main character is in this book, I think most everyone can identify with some of his thoughts. Palahniuk's style allows you to read quickly and aside from a very few slow parts in the book, I could not wait to turn the page. I recommend this book to anyone, especially those who haven't picked up a book in a while. I liked the book so much, I went out and got a copy of all his other books.
1402511787|5.0|The best book I've read this year. The perspective of a child  maturing to womanhood and finally into an old woman, engrossing battle scenes, a fabulous love story - I was shocked to read reviewers who weren't spellbound as my family and friends were. To the point made by some other reviewers that the plot was difficult to follow, I did go back and reread the last chapter, but was glad for the excuse. While I do agree that pretentious prose can be a turn-off - I've never read more than a chapter in any Louis Begley book - I disagree that this book was off-putting. I found the distinctly British style essential to the story - to make the action believable, it could only happen in a society where form is primary.
B000002W8O|5.0|In spite of the continual wave of Elvis imitators, there can be only one Elvis, and on the CD, you get to hear each side of his nature.  &quot;Santa Claus Is Back In Town&quot; and &quot;Santa Bring My Baby Back To Me&quot; represent the rockin' Elvis; &quot;Here Comes Santa Claus&quot; and the classic &quot;Blue Christmas&quot; are gentler rock offerings; &quot;White Christmas&quot; and &quot;I'll Be Home For Christmas&quot; are sentimental secular songs;  &quot;Oh Little Town Of Bethlehem&quot; and &quot;Silent Night&quot; are reverently delivered traditional carols; &quot;Peace In The Valley&quot; and &quot;I Believe&quot; are beautiful spiritually oriented numbers; and &quot;Take My Hand, Precious Lord&quot; and Stuart Hamblen's &quot;It Is No Secret&quot; brings the album to a very sincerely devotional close.<br />The entire album is a classic.
0064471837|5.0|This is an awesome book. Sabriel battles the Dead from all levels of the Nine Gates. It is incredibly cool, as the rules of Necromancy and Charter Magic are amazing. This book absolutely transformed me, as few books do. A must read for all fantasy-lovers.
0375707972|4.0|I was recommended this little gem of a novel, by my friend, and I must say that it is short, bitter/sweet and thought provoking. Here we are introduced to Michael Berg a young impressionable boy, who like most young male men, yearns for the sex of a woman. Michael then meets up with Hanna an older mysterious character that is both loving and distant, yet who seems to be hiding a secret so disturbing that it consumes her life. <BR>The author, spends little time on embellishments and metaphorically strips his characters to the bare bones. Again short and bitter/sweet story telling up until the controversial ending; which I though appropriate. Give it a try.
B00005JLKB|5.0|When Smallville first came out, I thought the entire idea of the series was a bad idea. I didnt even start watching it until the season premiere of the 2nd season, but I INSTANTLY loved it! I was woefully proved wrong about my initial impressions. <br />The show is about Clark Kent before he was Superman. He has the powers (except flying), lives on a farm!, goes to high school, has normal friends, and even has a girl who he's interested in. He has a bit of an interest in journalism, but it's his friend Chloe that is the journalist of the group, with Clark only helping with the investigating. Lana and Clark both have unacknowledged feelings for one another, but the feelings appear to be growing stronger as the show wears on. <br />It's an awesome show and I cant wait for it to come out on DVD!
0385474547|5.0|I don't like reading fiction at all.  The only time I ever read fiction was in school.  That is when I read this book.  Could you imagine, I still remember this book after reading it more than ten years ago!?  It had a much long-lasting impact on me.  Of course, the writing is superb and hypnotizing, but what I treasure most is the irony at the end.  A cleverly, truthful, and untimely uncovering of the hypocrisy we live with in this world.  As a non-fiction reader, I highly recommend it!
B00007E8O5|5.0|Finally we actually get the masterpiece as Jerry himself intended.  This is a remarkable 2 CD set, if you liked the first release, this is a must have.  I have been a AIC fan for a long time, and absolutely love their music.  I believe Jerry is one of the most gifted musician/songwriters in the industry today.  Like many others out there, I was inspired to pick up the guitar 9 years ago after hearing AIC, and there is no better honor to a musician than learning and playing the songs they have written, which I love to do.  Degradation Trip is full-on honest music by an honest man.  It doesn't get any better than this, from the chunky riffs to the haunting melodies this is the most complete package a musician can offer.  Keep em coming Jerry, you're the man.
0684857219|4.0|Anyone that is really serious in becoming big should read this book.  It is really long, but covers everything you need to know about the topic of getting big.  The pictures are fabulous and inspirational for anyone shooting for that kind of physique.  I recommend some smaller books for beginners because this is just too much for someone starting out to digest.  However, you should definitely read something on weighttraining or hire a personal trainer before you hit the gym because it is very easy to injure yourself if you don't know what you are doing or even if you think you know, you probably don't.
0446677450|4.0|Overall, I enjoyed the book.  It is full of money makng strategies that are interesting and helpful.  It gives the reader a good idea about how money works and how to think out of the box.  It is also written in a conversational tone that makes it easy to read.  I liked how the author used his own personal experiences as examples.  It is very informative and is a good book to read before setting out into the workforce.<BR>There were some aspects that I didn't like.  I thought the whole first half was very slow; it seemed to be a huge, unecessary introduction.  It was also a bit sad to read about a little nine ear old boy that was so obsessed about making money and being rich.  But I'm sure that certain parts were exaggerated for effect. As a whole it was a very thorough, interesting book.
B00005JKZT|5.0|Alrighty.. I was one of those peeps that was lucky enough to have a midnight showing of the Two Towers in my area.. And all I can say is this.. AWESOME!!!!!!!<br />I am not going to give any spoilers away here so if that is what you are looking for please see the other posting with spoilers.. Instead.. I am going to give you a short rundown of the parts I found wonderfull..<br />1) The movie began with a bang.. By showing us what happened to our beloved wizard as he feel down the hole.. I found myself cheering.. <g><br />2) The acting was again superb!  The director again showed his eye for understanding this Middle Earth.<br />3) The CGI.. Ahh the CGI.. It was awesome!!!  Specially the big battle which is all CGI but, you would swear that it was not..  And then there is Gollum.. Being a CGI creature you would thing that they would not pan to him to much but, instead he is very prolific in this movie and very.. very.. well done..<br />4) The three subplots will just blow your mind away.. (well there are actually more then three but, you count them..<br />5) The musical score is just fantastic!!<br />And there is my list.. If I may say soo this movie was (if possible) better then the first movie!  Wonder what they will do in the third and final movie?
B00006RCNW|5.0|Thank God for cable TV!<br />\\"The Shield\\" is the most intense new cop series in a decade.  The action centers around an proto-experimental police precinct in South Central L.A.  The action is violent and intense and pulls no punches.  Series lead Michael Chiklis stars as Vic Mackey, leader of an elite squad within the precinct.  Mackey is corrupt, amoral, but a great and effective cop.  Even when you want to hate him you can't help but root for him.  The precinct house's new Lieutenant makes no secret about wanting to bust Mackey as part of his political aspirations, but Mackey isn't going down without a fight.  And he certainly has the fight in him.<br />The final scene in the first episode set the tone for what kind of cop Mackey can be.  But throughout the whole first season viewers are treated to a level of grittiness and action rarely seen on television.  Always intense!<br />One particularly satisfying story arc in the first season centers around one of the precinct's new detectives trying to catch what he thinks might be a serial killer.  He eventually gets his man, and some unexpected respect from his fellow officers, but the psychological price he pays is what will resonate long after the case file is closed.<br />And \\"The Shield\\"'s visual style (namely the art direction and use of color) is unlike any other cop show you've seen before.  That sounds kind of odd if you haven't already seen the show, but it gives the show a distinctive look to go with its already distinctive sound and feel.<br />Watching this show gives me the same charge I got from watching the first season of \\"N.Y.P.D. Blue\\" -- the David Caruso season.<br />That whole first season is also available from Fox TV on DVD in early 2003.  Too bad the \\"...Blue\\" box set won't also contain the first four episodes from Season 2, the episodes that wrapped up David Caruso's character story line through his exit from the show.<br />**** Easy instructions for watching \\"The Shield - Season One\\" on DVD:<br />  Point, click, buy, watch, enjoy, pick jaw up off floor.:<BR>       Point, click, buy, watch, enjoy, pick jaw up off floor.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|While t.A.T.u. has garnered much-deserved praise in their home country and across Europe in general, North Americans are (possibly for the first time, excluding those of us who've been following them from the start) just hearing the amazing sounds of the Russian-based duo. If you fall into that particular category and are looking for advice on this cool new sound you keep hearing about, you're in the right place.<br />Although their import cd classifies them as having a 'The Prodigy'-esque sound, it should be noted that t.A.T.u.'s lyrics are far from the hard-hitting, yet often non-sensical noise of The Prodigy. Rather, the duo's lyrics speak right to the heart through tracks 1 to 11 (i.e., the end), and especially hit home on their brilliant cover of The Smith's &quot;How soon is now?&quot;. However, although the lyrics speak of love, don't be fooled. These are the tracks you'll be hearing popping up in dance clubs all over the continent. It really is the kind of soulful crossover that the electrona/techno industry needs.<br />Basically what it all comes down to is, if you like music that speaks the truth of the heart but also gets you up and on your feet, then look no further than this cd! Buy it, listen, and enjoy!
B00006LI4S|4.0|Acoustic Pink Floyd?!  Is it worth it?<br />To a large degree, yes.  Gilmour plays a rather intimate show featuring some Floyd, some solo work, a couple of Syd Barrett's tunes, a cover or two or three, and a surprisingly good song from guest Richard Wright.  Excellent 5.1 sound and a few bonus features.<br />It may not satisfy all of the Pink Floyd fans chomping at the bit for &quot;Pulse&quot; to be released on DVD (AND JUST WHEN CAN WE EXPECT THAT?!  GET ON THE BALL, WHOEVER YOU GUYS ARE!), but it is an interesting and satisfying consolation prize for the rest of us.
0312305060|4.0|Michael Cunningham's literary idol and muse was Virginia Woolf.  Taking her writing style he brings her back to life as one of the characters in \\"The Hours\\" and places her in 1923 London writing her novel \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\".  Spanning across time and space the other primary characters are Laura Brown in Los Angeles in 1940s and Clarissa Vaughn in Greenwich Village in the 1950's.<br />Clarissa Vaughn is planning a party for Richard, a poet dying of Aids and her oldest love.  Many years before he had nicknamed Clarissa \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" after the character in the novel and indeed she parallels the Mrs. Dalloway character in many respects.<br />The Laura Brown character is also introduced while preparing a party.  Her party is for her husband's birthday.  Laura is pregnant and looking for more to her life than being the housewife and mother.  In her searching she has become fascinated with the novel \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" and reads it fervently to the point that she escapes into the fictional life of \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\".<br />Michael Cunningham does a great job of producing a highly readable text that intertwines the lives of the three women.  A recommended read for anyone who enjoys Virginia Woolf's style of writing.
B00005QG9J|4.0|Vocally, lyrically, and musically, Morning View does it.  This album is much more introspective and mature than most of the albums rock bands release.  Everything about it is honest, and in a way poetic.  If you ever have to write a found poem, definitely pick a song from this cd.
B00000DC7J|5.0|This album is Piazzolla at his best!<BR>Gracias,<BR>Lorena Armulescu
B00006JJ1O|5.0|T.A.T.U.'s cd 200 Km/H in the Wrong Lane is destined to be a hit in america.  Their best known track, \\"All the Thing She Said,\\" is already played on some of the hottest radio stations in the country.  All of their songs have such a real quality to them.  Teens of all sexual orientation can relate to the lyrics in their music and know what it's like to feel misunderstood. Tatu speaks to thier audience and the audience is speaking back with loud cries of praise and adoration. The songs on the album that are stil in their origional Russian form are filled with such feeling in the way their sung.  Because it is their native language, all of the emotion behind the words can be heard in the voices of T.A.T.U.  This is a must have for anyone who's ever been in love.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|This album is what we need in music today.  Not that pop or rap that we've been unfortunate enough to listen to day after day. The same songs are played on the radio, over and over again.  It's maddening. <BR> T.A.T.U is bringing a whole new sound to the table, I call it rock/techno, it has great drum beats, and this catchy sound you just can't deny.  So all in all, its a great CD, its lyrics are perfect with the music.  I give it two thumbs up.
B0000542D2|5.0|Great music, naturally, good comedy, good picture quality and nice special features. I loved this movie.<br />It's vibrant, filled with energy and a lot of just plain fun with John, Paul, George and Ringo.
B000002WPI|5.0|Easily one of the top five hip-hop albums (at least that I've heard). Only in a spot or two does this album take a misstep, but even then it's better than the vast majority of rap out there. My personal favorites are \\"CREAM,\\" \\"...Ain't Nuthing Ta F' Wit,\\" \\"Tearz,\\" \\"Shame on a N',\\" & \\"7th Chamber, Pt. 2.\\" If you're down with hip-hop, chances are you've already worn this one out. If you just crawled out from under a rock or just turned 13 or so - go get it now or steal your friend's.
0767827902|5.0|Watching this for the first time a couple weeks ago, I was surprised first by how many known talents populate the cast. Cloris Leachman and Ben Johnson, who won Oscars for their work here, act alongside Ellen Burstyn, Cybil Shepherd, Timothy Bottoms, Randy Quaid and Jeff Bridges in this coming-of-age tale also focusing on the dead-end lives and passions among the inhabitants of a nearly forgotten town.<br />Anarene, Tex., is not the sort of place I'd want to visit, but the characters who live there are so well-drawn and human that they evoke my sympathy.<br />Sonny, losing and regaining the respect of Sam the Lion, his wise idol and the owner of the town's theater, ambles into adulthood in the most difficult way. He's got a crush on Jacy, his best friend Duane's girl. He's having an affair with his coach's wife Ruth, a lonely woman who finds a roundabout, not-entirely-wise way of falling in love with him. In the process, Sonny becomes desperate, learning about sex, adulthood and life's occasionally less-rewarding aspects.<br />While we watch Sonny, we also watch as Jacy learns from her mother and from the adults around her how to deal with her own sexual longings, despite her initial interest in an innocent, romantic love with Duane. What Jacy does about her sexuality and how it transforms her from a good girl to a mostly manipulative, powerful character is as startling as Sonny's transformation.<br />The final scene, involving Sonny and Ruth, is astounding. Cloris Leachman delivers a powerhouse monologue filled with longing and sorrow, to which Timothy Bottoms responds with a sad, youthful silence. Sonny's adulthood has come too quickly, and it's more than he can handle. The whole thing is heartbreaking.<br />This is a great, great movie. In black-and-white, it's beautiful to see. The well-written story is universal, and the acting is superb.
B00001IVOR|2.0|I wasn't at all impressed with this album(s). Enter the Wu-Tang was a milestone in the hip-hop era with one great track after another and this is just... weak. There are a few decent songs here, including \\"Reunited,\\" \\"The City,\\" & \\"It's Yours,\\" but this double album could easily be pared down into one. The only real gem here is \\"A Better Tomorrow.\\" It's easily one of the best rap songs I've heard in a long time. The single, \\"Triumph\\" in my humble opinion, just plain ... The Clan could use not only a real dj, but a producer who can tell good songs from filler garbage.
B00005OAIE|5.0|One of the best things I can ever say about an album is that I left it in the CD player and just let it play all the way through.<br />&quot;Room for Squares&quot; kept me entertained from its first song to its last, and, perhaps because I'm in Atlanta and Mayer sings of a lot of landmarks here, I found the CD more than refreshing. I found it personally applicable.<br />Hearing Mayer's travails about talking too much and ruining relationships struck a chord with me. Listening to someone sing of &quot;driving down 85&quot; when you're actually driving down I-85 gives the album this deja-vu sense.<br />The first song, which is the breakout hit &quot;No Such Thing,&quot; is indeed fun, but &quot;Georgia&quot; is the one that hits me hardest and makes me think.<br />I love this album.
B00006JJ1O|3.0|I prefered the girls Russina language album better as the emotion on some songs is conveyed much more effecively, especially on Ç&agrave;÷å&igrave; ÿ (track 4) - a very powerful song in Russion, a good song in English - which translated to \\"Stars\\" on 200 kph in the Wrong Lane.<br />Julia and Lena have great voices and the CD is very easy to listen to all the way through over and over.  The English album does not have translations of all the songs on the Russian album and there is a great cover of \\"How Soon is Now\\" where the girls' accents come through in an innocently sexy way.<br />I'd recommend buying the Russian language CD first and then after listening to it a few times, buy this CD.  Analyzing the differences adds anew dimension to the enjoyment as can hunting down translations of the original Russian and seeing how the meanings can change.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Norah Jones' smooth voice and soft jazz piano work could soothe any savage beast. This CD's success speaks volumes, for it's just simply high-quality music. I'm glad this is selling so well.<br />It's perfect mood music for days when you want to hold someone and days when you want to just sit by yourself, sip tea and read a good, thoughtful book.<br />I've not bought many jazz albums, which (let's face it) is what this is despite where it's being played on the radio, but this music's grand.<br />It's hard to believe Norah Jones is so young and that this is her first album. It's absolutely charming.
0425152251|5.0|This book is a brilliant way to introduce yourself to the world of Philosophy.  From the pre-Socratics all the way to the most current major philosophers, this book provides the reader with a wealth of information to whet the appetite for more.  The story itself is also intriguing and absorbing.  'Sophie's World' is a book I often recommend to people.  Read it, already!
0792846443|5.0|I love, love, love Kathy Bates in this movie. When I think of it, she is what I think of. When it was playing in theaters, I was about 14, and I managed to see it at least three times. Rob Reiner's direction is competent. James Caan's acting is surprisingly subdued. Even Richard Farnsworth, Lauren Bacall and Frances Sternhagen create sympathy for their barely shown characters.<br />But, my God, Kathy Bates is brilliant, playing Annie as someone quirky, scary and even funny. William Goldman's script, which originally called for Annie to use a welding torch to remove Paul Sheldon's feet, does allow her the chance to go over the top, of course, but Bates' subtlety at key points in the film is what floors me. The little touches showing Annie watching \\"Love Connection\\" or dancing around to Liberace records. Through these scenes, Bates actually builds sympathy for Annie's character, her loneliness, her \\"morality\\" and her need to love a fictional character.<br />As a viewer, I cared deeply for her, even after she went nuts, tied a man to a bed, took a sledgehammer to his legs, held him captive, let everyone around believe he was dead and then tried to shoot him to death.<br />Kathy Bates has been uniformly great in films ever since this one, but this one is my favorite of hers. She's amazing.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|This album is just amazing! I heard &quot;All the things she said&quot; for the first time on MTV and decided I like the sound of TATU very much, so I bought the album the day it was released in the USA. I love all the songs, would be very difficult to choose a favourite. <br />Their music is very catchy and after listening to it a few times you will find yourself singing along in Russian, having absolutely no idea what you might be saying! It also just gets me dancing, doesn't matter where I am, and the tunes have a knack of getting stuck in your head. So beware of singing out loud in public... you have been warned. I've done it and it was a little embarrassing ;) I have no idea how they manage to hit those high notes! I get nowhere near them.<br />I fully recommend this album to everyone, so go out and buy it today! I have found that in some albums all the music tends to sound the same. TATU's album is not like this, and I like that.
B00005JKDR|5.0|I don't know how. I don't know why. But it's beoming a pattern, that if you see the name Pixar on a movie, it's gonna be good! They keep making films that kids love, parent's love, and are only rated G (in other words, they never pull cheap laughs, like Shrek did every once in a while, earning them PG status). Monsters, Inc., is a great movie, very funny and has it's moments of peril, and it's moments of fun. The technology behind this movie is so complex now, that if the world was not 'stylized', they could make you believe it's for real! John Goodman and Billy Crystal do some great comedy together, and the late James Coburn does a fantastic change in the movie. I'll shut up, buy this movie is worth [the price]! Buy it, no matter who you are!

B00006LFGD|5.0|This 2002 compilation is a must have CD for Streisand fans. It includes all of her big duet hits, along with two new tracks! One of the newly recorded track is a duet with Josh Groban called &quot;All I Know Is Love&quot;, magnificent. The other new track is a duet with Barry Manilow entitled &quot;I Won't Be The One To Let Go&quot;, another great track. The duets on this album show her diversity as an artist, from classic ballads to uptempo disco, she covers it all. My favorite duets here include Guilty with Barry Gibb, What Kind of Fool with Barry Gibb, I Finally Found Someone with Bryan Adams, Tell Him with Celine Dion, No More Tears with Donna Summer, and Make No Mistake (He's Mine) with Kim Carnes. Other duet partners include Neil Diamond, Frank Sinatra, Ray Charles, Don Johnson, Vince Gill, Michael Crawford, July Garland, and more. This is the perfect gift or CD for any fan of Barbra's.
0848801571|4.0|This is a great story of human evolution, but has little character development.  How does the earth react when &quot;Guardian Angels&quot; come down and establish peace?

B00006SFLV|5.0|My So-Called Life is *by far* the best teen-drama ever made.<BR>Its characters are real people who we get to know on a level that is much more profound than any other teen related show.<BR>I loved this show in high school when it first aired, and I still love it now in my mid twenties. This is a good show for high school ages through adulthood.<BR>So stop reading these pages upon pages of positive reviews and watch it!
B00004Y6NV|4.0|After many years of hiatus after \\"Brothers In Arm\\", Dire Straits finally comes out with a new album. If you've been listening to Mark Knopfler during the Straits break, then this album isn't anything new to hear. After playing with Chet Atkins on \\"Neck and Neck\\", and his time with the Notting Hillbillies, there isn't a surprise that \\"On Every Street\\" is heavily flavored with a country sound. This isn't a bad thing, and the album is still very good, it's just a large departure from the Dire Straits of the 70s and 80s. <br />One thing is certain about this album though, and that is Knopfler's guitar work is still a thing of beauty. His phrasing is simple, yet he is able to speak volumes with just a few notes. \\"Fade to Black\\", the best cut on the album, is a good example of his playing. Very blues on this cut, and just enough notes to pull at your soul. He doesn't have to be flashy, and he still sets the mood quite well. \\"Heavy Full\\", \\"Iron Band\\" and \\"Planet of New Orleans\\" has that Straits flavor, especially from later in their career. Songs like \\"When It Comes to You\\", \\"Ticket to Heaven\\" and \\"How Long\\" are heavily flavored with Country. <br />Fortunately, I enjoy Country and the other solo stuff that Knopfler has done. Even though I was hoping for the Strait's sound, this is still a good album. The songs are well mixed up so you're not stuck with Country cut after cut. If you're a fan of Knopfler, this is a good album to get. It's more like the prequel to \\"Golden Heart\\".
B00005JL7Q|5.0|In yet another year where comedies have been painfully dominated by the sort of sophomoric gross-out humor revitalized by \\"American Pie,\\" \\"About a Boy\\" was a real standout. (Ironically, it's  directed by the Weitz brothers, who also directed \\"American Pie.\\" Go figure.) Based on the novel by Nick Hornby (\\"High Fidelity\\"), Hugh Grant (\\"Four Weddings and a Funeral\\") plays a confirmed bachelor with no real human connections, no job, and no need for one (he's independently wealthy, and it's a humorous twist when you find out why). His world changes when he meets a single mother (Toni Collette, \\"The Sixth Sense\\") and her young son (standout newcomer Nicholas Hoult) that start to put a little perspective to his world.<br />In any other writer's hands this would have turned into a sappy romance between Grant and Collette, but that never happens here. The movie is, instead, about Grant and Hoult and how their unlikely friendship shapes them both. Plus it's just really funny, and never what you'd expect.
0553266306|5.0|This is great book about an attempt by some ex-military officers in France to assassinate Charles de Gaulle. Like all books I enjoy, the author really knows his stuff. The OAS, after failing to do away with de Gaulle themselves, hire a professional hitman code named the Jackal. This guy is really good but the french have their own really good detective. It's a struggle to stop the Jackal with the fate of France hanging in the balance. The countdown (or page turner) plot with the historical setting seems to be the key to writing sucessful books and this has it.
B00006IUL7|5.0|Al Pacino  (\\"Any Given Sunday\\") plays a cop summoned to the Alaskan town of Nightmute to track down a killer. The town is in a part of the world where daylight lasts for six months, and Pacino's trouble sleeping slowly begins to drive him mad.<br />Featuring wonderful performances from Hilary Swank (\\"Boys Don't Cry\\"), Maura Tierny (TV's \\"ER\\") and the incredible Robin Williams (\\"Good Will Hunting\\"), this movie is not the mystery one would expect. You know from the outset that Williams is the killer, and the drama comes from Pachino's struggle to capture him, especially after his exhaustion causes him to make an unspeakable mistake. Williams is best known as a comedian, but when he takes on dramatic roles like this, you get to see how good an actor he really is.<br />Director Christopher Nolan (\\"Memento\\") is becoming the master of a new breed of movies that aren't quite film noir but have enough in common with that genre to compare. And favorably, too. As in \\"Memento\\" he uses the trick of showing you only pieces of the puzzle in an odd order right up until the end, where it all comes together. Nolan has earned a spot on my slim list of filmmakers I'll give my theater admission price to no matter what.<br />I'm glad Warner Bros actually gave us both a fullscreen AND a widescreen edition, rather than just a fullscreen like some studios have opted for lately... but I still don't get why anyone would watch fullscreen in this day and age. Get the widescreen. See the movie the way it was MEANT to be seen.
0312955006|5.0|It is a good idea to read these Harry Bosch stories in order, starting with The Black Echo, The Black Ice, and then this, the 3rd in the series. Bosch has killed a serial murderer previously and now the widow is suing Bosch. My 1st thought was \\"Please Lord, don't let her win !\\" I don't want to spoil anything but if Bosch and the LAPD lost this suit I wasn't reading anymore Michael Connelly ! Anyhow, the suit is secondary to the page turning plot which has to do with a copycat serial killer. I really like this series because Connelly understands the LAPD and Bosch is a very likeable and dedicated detective. So will you !
B00006CXSS|5.0|it's simply the greatest movie ever made.  Yes, the war is the backbone of the stories obviously, but the dynamics involved with this movie are just so fantastic there is no point writing more about it.  No one can do it justice by doing so.  Hands down the greatest film ever made.  Private Ryan was a warm up.
0792151712|1.0|If u really want a good 2 video movie, get Scarface or the Ten Commandments, whoa now ain't that goin' too low?  Well Scarface is much better thn this, and if u want a good movie that won a bit of oscars, watch Glory, Forest Gump, or The Godfather.  This is the biggest definition of a boring movie u can find.  The only good part is when the dude fell of the ship and hit one of the propellers, dat was cool.  This lacked everything that could prevent this from being borin', and it's one of the most cheeziest luv storiez ive seen in all my life.

B00005JKZT|5.0|Like all of us, I've been looking forward to the second installment of Peter Jackson's _Lord of the Rings_ trilogy for a year now.  _The Two Towers_ has always been my favourite of the original trilogy.  Well, I'm happy to say the _The Two Towers_, the movie met and exceeded my expectations in nearly every respect.<br />Taking up where FoTR left off, \\"Towers\\" follows the now sundered members of the Fellowship on their disparate paths.  Frodo and Sam are heading for Mordor, hooking up along the way with Gollum, who agrees to guide them.  Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli pursue the Orcs who have captured Merry and Pippin, eventually coming to Rohan where they are caught up in that country's struggle against Saruman.  Merry and Pippin come through a series of perils to the forest of Fangorn, where they meet Treebeard the Ent.  By the end of the movie, everyone will have fought some kind of battle, either personal or monumental, against overwhelming odds.<br />Overall, _The Two Towers_ is even truer to the original than was FoTR.  Jackson takes a lot of time to go through this important part of the trilogy, with the result that he's only about 2/3 of the way through the book by the end.  I didn't mind this at all.  IN fact, I thought the slower pace was a good juxtaposition with the intensity of many of the events and the transitions seemed much less hectic than they were in FoTR.  I enjoyed the added material, particularly the extra Rohan scenes that set up the situation and the characters.  Many places in this movie, Jackson shows us things that are only told or alluded to in the book, and it works very well.<br />Once again the acting was great, both from the old characters and the new.  I loved the casting of Miranda Otto as Eowyn.  Brad Dourif shone as Grima Wormtongue, a character I always found somewhat flat in the books, and Bernard Hill as Theoden was also great.  I can't wait to see more of Eomer -- he ruled every scene he was in.<br />The CG effects were amazing.  I loved the Ents, who were a perfect combination of treeishness and bipedal humanoid.  But the real star goes to Gollum, a character so real that I could hardly believe he...uh...wasn't real.  The portrayal of his struggle between his \\"Slinker\\" and \\"Stinker\\" halves was incredibly well done -- at risk of sacrilege I would say even better than in the books.  And the way the realtionship and similarities between him and Frodo were played up was a good touch.<br />There were several departures from the book but only one that really bothered me (and bothered everyone who was at the midnight show I went to):  What they did to Faramir was just wrong and annoying.  I think maybe I have some idea why they did it, but, well, they just shouldn't have.<br />Other than that, the only flaw in this movie was that for about the first third of it much of the dialogue was very hard to understand, particularly the growly effects voices.  I'll need to see \\"Towers\\" again (as if I wouldn't anyway) just to pick up what I missed the first time around.<br />_The Two Towers_ is quite long -- a little over three hours by my clock -- but it never suffers from drag.  I enjoyed every minute (Except the Faramir bits).  This is one great movie!  I'm counting the minutes until the DVD comes out and the days until _Return of the King_!I loved the Ents, who were a perfect combination of treeishness and bipedal humanoid.

B00000099Z|5.0|Tool truly is the best band ever. With Aenima they show how musically genius they are. Pulsating beats and gripping vocals make this the best album I have ever bought, and will most likely ever buy, unless Tool comes out with one that surpasses this one, which I think is impossible for even them to do. If you haven't bought this record then you are missing out on a musical masterpiece. I'm sure every Tool fan (and alot of whom are not fans) would agree--the album is incredible.
B00005AQE8|5.0|This is, without a doubt one of the, if not, the best rap album of all time.  A few songs off this Double disc CD have been sampled like ambitionz az a rhidah(Cam'ron leave me alone)(Fabalous Y'all can't deny it(Hook)), I ain't mad acha(Blackstreet Don't leave me) All eyes on me(Nas street dreams).  But those songs weren't better than Pac's songs.  My favorite songs are, Anbitrionz az a rhidah, All bout u, Got my mind made up, How do u want it, 2 of Amerikaz most wanted, No more pain, Heartz of men, life goes on, California love, I ain't mad acha, U can't c me, Shorty wanna be thig, wonder why they call u..., All eyes on me, ain't hard to find, and heaven ain't hard to find.  Some of the other songs are good too, but not as good as these in my opinion, but if u don't have this album, u gotta check it out and see why pac's the greatest.<br />Peace out
B00006JJ1O|5.0|These two Russian hotties proclaim their hearts to the world through their wicked (awesome) lyrics and beautiful voices.

6305558175|1.0|From the creaky opening scenes to the final crash of Gere's wooden acting this film takes the biscuit for tedium. Rumoured that Foster only accepted the film after more lucrative contracts fell through, it remains a pale travesty of the original French film. A weak attempt to make the film palatable for US audiences goes totally against the original medieval European story that has been unsuccessfully updated to the period of the American Civil War. The deception that was just barely believable when set at the time of the Hundred Years' War, where it could play off the superstition that a man might be transformed by war becomes totally unbeleivable in its present version. My advice - paint some walls and watch 'em dry.

B00006G8G1|4.0|First off, this concert is fantastic.  The sound is clear and blistering, the energy with all six members recalls 1985's LAD.  Overall, I say \\"Get It,\\"  it's an excellent concert with newer Maiden songs sounding like old Maiden classics!<BR>Alas, there is a caveat:<BR>The editing is schizophrenic.  Something like 38 cameras are used which isn't the problem, it's the fact they're all used within a minute of each other over and over again preventing the viewer from focusing on anything for more than a couple of seconds.  <BR>In this day of MTV editing,  Iron Maiden should be above this.  The haphazard editing, I believe, is supposed to enhance the energy and excitement of the show but it detracts from it because it's somewhat annoying hoping to watch a camera shot for more than 2 seconds.<BR>Final note to band:  You don't need wild editing to show excitement, everybody at that concert only had one view, and they left exhausted from what I'm sure was the most intense concert they've ever seen.
B000062XM7|5.0|I've lost count of how many times I've seen this exceptional film, and the number of future viewings will no doubt be countless.  Michael Mann's THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS grips the viewer from the first frame to the last, with stunning cinematography, a haunting musical score, sensational acting, and a powerful story of conflict, romance, and a father's unspoken love for his two sons--one a Mohican, one white.<br />THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS takes us to the colonial French & Indian Wars of the mid-18th Century in America.  England and France were battling for domination of the continent, aided by fleeting alliances with various Indian tribes:  the Huron, the Mohawk, the Sac & Fox...the Mohican.  Three men striving to avoid this conflict are unwillingly drawn into it:  Chingachgook (Russell Means), a proud Mohican warrior, and his two sons, Uncus (Eric Schweig), and adopted son, Hawkeye (Daniel Day-Lewis).  Hawkeye's character is especially compelling:  born into the white culture, raised as an Indian, he is a transcendental bridge to both worlds.  The story picks up the journey of the three characters as they save a British officer and two daughters of a British colonel from a Huron ambush and accompany them to Fort William Henry; an intense romance between Hawkeye and Cora Monroe (Madeline Stowe) ensues.  The fort ultimately falls from a relentless assault of French cannon, the British leave, a bloody battle ensues.  Hawkeye and Cora are forced to separate:  he flees with his father and brother, she stays with her sister, to be captured by the Huron.  The film builds to a heart-pounding climax over a series of magnificent scenes that depict love, sacrifice, tragedy, and a father's revenge--all against the backdrop of music that tingles the spine.<br />Additional kudos go to Wes Studi, who plays the troubled Huron warrior Magua, whose twisted vision of justice adds yet another remarkable dimension to the story.  THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS has it all:  action, drama, tragedy, conflict, remorse, love.  Very highly recommended.edy, conflict, remorse, love.  Very highly recommended.
B000002KDG|5.0|I always thought Neil Young was just some cheesy folky with a funny singing voice who sang about searching for a Heart of Gold and being a child.  Around the time of Freedom I went off to college and met a whole group of people who thought Neil was the greatest.  When I heard Like A Hurricane (from American Stars'n'Bars) I flipped over the intensity of the performance.  Then I began dating a girl who would play After the Gold Rush and sing along while massaging my back and I immediately fell in love with the album (who wouldn't?).<br />Then I somehow got Rust Never Sleeps.  What drew me to it I'm not sure.  BUt I consdier myself lucky - this is definitely among the best Neil albums, and may be - aside from the (early) greatest hits Decade - the place to start.<br />The opening track has all the lyrical style that kept me away from Neil, but Trasher is lovely with Neil accompanying himself with a 12-string guitar and harmonica.  Ride My Llama is a throwaway, but because I never realized Neil wrote cheap throwaway tunes for laughs I really appreciated it.  Sail Away is charming and should definitely be considered for anyones' wedding song.<br />But the song that won me over is Pocahontas.  Absolutely mesmerixzing - a yearning lyric about the slaughter of the Native Americans, the song manages to jump some 300 years in one single line in the second verse (\\"They massacred the buffalo/Kitty corner from the bank\\") and jumps from being a documentary to a personal rumination that is both rueful and erotic.  The rest of the album could've been Neil and Crazy Horse belching, and it would still be worth ten times the price.<br />Fortunately, the rest of the album ROCKS.  Powderfinger is another story of death and change, and features a posthumous final verse from the narrator - wonderful, and a great guitar solo to boot.<br />And after that it's Garage Rock as only Crazy Horse could play it - if you know Neil primarily for his Harvest material, this will blow you away.  \\"Welfare Mothers\\" is a great bumper sticker, and \\"Sedan Delivery\\" has some of the funniest, most corrosive riffs and lyrics in rock.  (Nirvana arguably based their entire career on this song).<br />And the closing track reprise of Hey Hey My My?  Absolutely jawdropping.  It's among the HEAVIEST riffs in rock.  And it's not like the band sat there and said, \\"Hey, wouldn't it be a groove to rock that tune up?\\"  It's more like they all realized, \\"Waitaminnit, that tune NEEDS to have BALLS!\\"<br />And, good lord, it does.  Along with Gold Rush, On the Beach, Tonight's the Night, and Decade this is absolutely essential Neil.  Buy it.  Buy several.  It makes a great gift.fare Mothers\\" is a great bumper sticker, and \\"Sedan Delivery\\" has some of the funniest, most corrosive riffs and lyrics in rock.

B00005JKZT|5.0|Having just watched Lord of The Rings, The Two Towers, I can say with all candor that the movie is a fine successor to The Fellowship of The Ring. This movie is bigger and bolder, with an emphasis on action. The battle scenes are beautifully filmed, and the special effects remarkable. I would have liked to see some of the characters fleshed out a little more, but overall this is grand entertainment, and well worth the price of admission. Kudos to Peter Jackson and the cast for bringing Tolkien's vision to life on the big screen.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|First, I'll start off with the fact that I'm a frequent listener of international music. In stating that, t.A.T.u.'s english album, while different from the original Russian release, is truly amazing. The tones of their voices are so entrancing even in a different language, someone like myself often just listens to the music just for the emotions that the tones produce. When I started looking into the lyrics, I was amazed at how powerfull the words really were. Even though I don't know who, if anyone, assists them in writing, the thought and power written into each song rings a tone worth steeping over. I recommend this album to anyone who really enjoys dance music combined with thoughtful, powerful ballads that are sure to elicit a positive response from ANY listener! Cheers for Lena and Julia!
B000024L5R|5.0|Let's start by figures this time:<BR>Grammy winner for Best Album.<BR>Two major hits (BECAUSE YOU LOVED ME, penned by nonetheless than Diane Warren and produced by David Foster, and the Jim Steinman's written and produced collaboration on IT'S ALLCOMING BACK TO ME NOW).<BR>Three covers (Eric Carmen's ALL BY MYSELF, Aretha Franklin's NATURAL WOMAN and Tina Turner's RIVER DEEP MOUNTAIN HIGH).<BR>Three english versions for some of her biggest french hits.<BR>A real under-estimated ballad (CALLED THE MAN, by the same writing team of THINK TWICE) and two knockout tracks (DREAMIN' OF YOU and YOUR LIGHT).<BR>Many different A-list producers.<BR>All in style with Celine vocals and elegance.<BR>And we know she has still a long way to go...
B000021Y77|5.0|This is one of the most exciting films I have seen in a long, long time.  It's a story that could only be told in this medium, and it uses the medium in the telling.<br />Got that?  I know it's become cliche to say that a film has broken new ground, but this one really has.  It's so fun to watch you'll find yourself on the edge of your seat, palms sweaty, pulse racing.<br />An amazing film.  I loved it.
B00005JLRR|2.0|I have looked forward to this movie for the past year.  I read what those involved with the movie said they were trying to accomplish.  I thought the plot was a great idea, but the ideas was poorly delivered in this film.  It was more \\"Star Wars\\" than \\"Star Trek.\\"  Plus, when the bad guys sneak up on the good guys and are 10 feet away and fire and miss, and this happens over and over in this movie, it takes any sense of realism out of the picture. Plus, the dune buggy sequence is also ridiculous and totally detracts from any sense of real danger or realism.  Patrick Stewart is a great actor, but he said in interviews that he had a hard time \\"finding\\" Picard for this movie.  I'm not sure he ever found him.  A great disappointment and one of the worst of the Star Trek movies, if not the worst.  The \\"friction\\" between Picard and Shinzon was nothing compared to that between Kirk and Khan.  And there are many more disappointments than I will take the time to go into here.
B000002OZY|5.0|One of my favorite albums for as long as I can remember.  The story is fascinating, and as revelant today as it was over 30 years ago.  The music is still incredibly complex.  It is amazing how ahead of his time Pete Townsend was in 1969.  If you only know the popular songs like &quot;Pinball Wizard&quot; and &quot;Acid Queen&quot;, come get to know &quot;Cousin Kevin&quot; and the rest of the family.  It's well worth your time, and your money!
630027120X|5.0|This is the best movie of all times, not only for the scenery but all the actors.<BR>   I can't believe that It haven't been released in DVD, please we want it on DVD.
B000002J1B|5.0|In my opinion Yes has to be rated as the epitome of Progressive Rock. They have lasted and continue to put out good music. This CD is the pinnacle of their work. The Gates Of Delirium is the pinnacle of the album and Soon, the song within the song, is the pinnacle of &quot;Gates.&quot; I also think that Steve Howe's solo from Soon rates another pinnacle. It may take a few listens to let this grow on you but if you like Prog you have to get into it! The other two tracks are also fantastic.
B000002VSN|3.0|I guess Whitney succeeded in having Gospel music crossing borders and reaching listeners that normally wouldn't give a hoot about this type of music.<BR>Sure, her name on the cd cover is a guarantee, but she was coy enough to match this genre along with some more chart-friendly stuff as I BELIEVE IN YOU AND ME (being the movie version far superior than Foster's produced one) and STEP BY STEP - written and backed up by Annie Lennox - and YOU WERE LOVED (first track written for her by Diane Warren, that unfortunately sounds too much like Celine's BECAUSE YOU LOVED ME).<BR>Plus, the whole collection is the soundtrack to Whitney's third movie role.<BR>Lots of movie goers just bought it expecting a second BODYGUARD...<BR>Sorry to diaappoint..this is total different stuff.<BR>Good for the holiday seasons...
B00005JKZT|5.0|Fun and action packed.  True Tolkein fans beware... as with the first movie, several things from the story are excluded (to be expected) however, a few major things are added... curious decicsions on Jackson's part.  If one can forgive the liberties taken by the creative team, then you will truly enjoy this movie (some will NOT forgive... to each their own).<br />Legolas fans will rejoice, however Gimli fans may be disappointed at his \\"demotion\\" to comic relief. Fans of the book will know that he is a much more competent warrior than the movie portrays.  Still, he does have the best comic lines in the movie.  It might have been a good idea to reveal that he actually WINS that little competition he has with Legolas.  Again, a little forgiveness on behalf of the audience will prevent this from ruining the movie in a grand sense.<br />Gollum is well done, as are the Ents.  The story of the ring kind of takes a back seat to the battle at Helm's Deep, however that is probably more Tolkein's design.<br />Lots and lots of stand-up-and-cheer moments... mostly in the later half of the movie.  The Eowyn-Aragorn-Arwen triangle adds rich drama on an emotional level, even though the chemistry has been tweaked somewhat.<br />5 stars for making a fantastic follow-up to a fantastic \\"Fellowship\\"
B0000025ZF|5.0|I guess I can understand some people giving this CD low marks based on their expectations of another Pink Floyd album. If you think Dark Side is the greatest and The Final Cut isn't, than you should probably not bother with this. For me this is the number one, most fantastic CD I have ever heard. Hands downn. Period. It's almost 20 years later and I can quote nearly every line - and every line is brilliant. It creates such a mood that it sucks you in completely. I agree that musically it may not be the greatest thing ever, but yet it works perfectly. And Roger's voice is perfect. This CD is about life. It's sort of like reading a book. No, its not for everyone, but at least for me I connected with this better than anything I have ever heard before or since. The Final Cut is also in my top 5. Thank you Roger. <BR>I said go then.<BR>She said, OK.
B000021Y77|5.0|Manni has lost 100 000 deutschemarks that he owes to a diamond-smuggling gangster he is meeting in 20 minutes.  The titular Lola is Manni's girlfriend, whom he calls for help when he realises the money is missing.  Lola sets off on a frantic run through the streets of Berlin to try and extract the money from her father, a banker, before Manni gets desperate and holds up a grocery store for the funds.  However, such a bare-bones description does not do justice to this hyperkinetic, immensely enjoyable film.<br />Since Lola only has only 20 minutes, and the film is 80 minutes, it's not giving away the plot to say that the race to get the funds happens 3 times - the first 2 end in disaster, so she has to try, try again.  I'll leave for you to discover how it turns out the third time.  Between these action sequences are surprisingly effective hallucinatory dialogues between Lola and Manni, and you develop a sense of their relationship.  This kind of gimmick has been used before (the most recent that I've seen being Groundhog Day), but this is the most enjoyable rendition I've seen.  It's unclear if this is the same Lola or an alternate universe.  The movie wisely steers clear of such metaphysical questions, and you accept the story's reality (much as you accept the reality of &quot;The Matrix&quot;) because it is self-consistent and the actors are so convincing.<br />It's not perfect - there are too many gimmicks in the title sequence that you almost get annoyed enough to look negatively at the rest of the film.  However, there's something beautiful about Lola's run, much like watching an Olympic long-distance race.  With bright red hair flapping in the breeze, arms pumping, you can't help but admire the energy she has, even while faintly disbelieving that a smoker could maintain such a pace for 20 minutes.  It's good that it is enjoyable, because a good 1/3 of the movie is simply watching her run!<br />The DVD has the typical extras, including an English commentary (bythe director and the actress that played Lola) for the Region 1 encoded discs.  There are some neat gems in the commenary, explaining things that would be familiar to German moviegoers (the identities of certain actors, for instance) but not to American ones.  These are minutae, however, that you don't need to enjoy the film.  It's a credit to the filmaker that the film is so universal that it can be enjoyed by any audience.
0553381709|4.0|The first 3 books of George R.R. Martins Song of Ice and Fire series are extremely well written and very good.<br />The only problem I have with them is his use of switching the readers point of view from place to place and character to character every chapter.<br />This kicks me out of the book at the beginning of virtually every new chapter where I suddenly have to shift gears and try to remember exactly where I was when I read about this character 60 pages earlier. It would not be so bad if he only had 5 or 6 different characters that he focuses on, but he has more like 10 to 12 characters that he focuses on in each book. For someone like myself, this becomes very tedious. For example, instead of continuing reading while I'm hungry (i.e. getting so pulled into the book that I cannot put it down), this forces me to notice that I am hungry and I will put the book down to go get food.<br />Other than that, it is extremely well written. I won't bother to list all of the things that I like since most everyone else has done that for me.
B00007E8O5|5.0|I wish I would have waited for this one instead of buying the 1-disc version.  More of the same, but it's all good.  Best of the new stuff is \\"Pro-False Idol\\" and \\"Siddartha\\".  And then there's the instrumental \\"Hurts, Don't it?\\"  Yes, I'm a sucker for instrumental pieces!!<br />It's worth buying, even if you already have the one-disc version.  This is the \\"Trip\\" Cantrell had planned to take his fans on.
B00005JLRR|4.0|Nemesis was a good movie, with great performances from the entire cast. The film has an unusual tone, with a jovial look at the crew joking around like high school class mates in the beginning, moving over to political and personal intrigue and finally descending into a tooth and nail battle against an unusually ruthless enemy.<BR>I've read the typical \\"fan\\" whining, but those with an open mind will find the movie entertaining. The so-called fans never know what they want and always give all kinds of backlash to these great pros who invest all this work JUST TO ENTERTAIN US!!!<BR>I don't care what the hell you say, I was chilled to see the defeated look on Picard's face as the computer tells him that self destruct is off-line. I mean, he looked crushed! Now there was a great moment.<BR>The film flew by in terms of running time and sacrificed a few things on the way. Were there any scenes where Shinzon was actually moved by Picard's pleas and considered coming over to the good side? Now that would have been drama! Were there other ways to detonate Shinzon's weapon before Data made his brave move? <BR>We'll get the answer when the studio releases the DVD...which as Lord of the Rings proves, is fast becoming THE way to watch a film.<BR>Until then, farewell Next Generation cast and crew. You've been great!
6304539282|3.0|First of all I love star wars it is one of the best triogys ever.I'm upset at the fact that the orginal version will no longer be avilable. The special editons are lucas atempt to make these movies seem more modern but it takes away from the movie i mean greeto shooting 1st stupid.Vhs tapes wear out if you watch them enough the orginals need to be realesed. I hope that the futire Dvd version will contain both versions of the movie because the special editon is alright sometimes but the orginal is the best.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|Hello. I think that this Cd is 2002 best cd (well, maybe the second, after Springsteen). The songs are very good (they are 8 new songs, very good, songs). My favorites are: All the things she said and Show me love. The rest (30 seconds, not gonna get us, malchik gay, clowns, Stars) are, also, great. There is a new version of \\"how soon is now?\\", a very good songs for this girls' voices. Well, the songs are fantastic, but THE BEST of the cd is Julia and Lena's voices; THEYR VOICES ARE INCREDIBLE. Please, belive me, YOU HAVE TO BUY THIS CD NOW !!! NOW!!!. Thank you, and TATU FOREVER.
0066214122|1.0|That is all this book is.  There are too many plot holes to even mention here.  The dialouge is terrible and he sums up the plot lines after each interaction like a soap opera would.  The book had a great idea and the book needed to be technical, which is great, but he dumbs everything down to a 5 year old reading level.  Wait for the movie and you might be able to see some cool special effects, but don't expect anything you haven't seen before.
0783222149|5.0|One of the least talked about films of the 1990's is also one of the best. This is an often overlooked gem featuring perhaps the best performance to date from Kevin Bacon. The movie itself is a nice change of pace for an action movie. It keeps you hooked from the beginning to the very end and it seems you learn something new about the characters in every scene. Bacon plays the evil villian to perfection and for the first time in along time, he seems motivated. If you are a fan of Kevin Bacon, this is a MUST SEE!
1573225517|5.0|Nick Hornby's \\"High Fidelity\\" is, along with W. Somerset Maugham's \\"Razor's Edge,\\" one of my favorite books to read and the both of them should be required reading for any boy becoming a man (i.e. in high school/college). Or even for any woman, although this is one book that could best describe how and why men are the way they are.<br />  The movie, starring John Cusack, is an OK adaptation of the book, but, in the long-run, doesn't come close to covering all of the many true-isms of the book. Take my word for it, guys: This is one book you have to read simply because it's right on the money of how men think, feel and act.<br />  Also, being a man who has worked at a music store for a very funny time, I found the music, movie and pop references simply great! Anyone will! The fact that Hornby also dedicates a portion of a chapter to Bruce Springsteen and his songs is simply genius!<br />  This book helps to explain just why men can mostly be jerks: If we weren't, women would lose the interest. That's why nice guys fall behind in the dating pool! A great example of this in the book is when he's talking about how 14-18-year-old boys have this massive sex drive but girls at that age are not interested. However, a 32-year-old woman hits her sexual peak and by that time the man has been rejected so much from women that he no longer doesn't even really try. Hornby's theory: \\"The perfect man for the 32-year-old woman is the 14-year-old b-b-b-b-boy!\\"<br />  I may have written it so it sounds ridiculous. But trust me. If you read Hornby's descriptive facts and ways of explaining, then you'll believe it's true also.<br />  This book is difficult to put down and come to read later because of the hysterically funny and very real insights that his character comes to descover. The women are bashed but uncovered for some of their ridiculousness just as men are in through his slacker hero, Rob. Each character is well written and the character of Rob's girlfriend, Laura, is endearing.<br />  READ THIS BOOK!!! YOU WON'T REGRET IT!!! Whether you're a boy, girl, man, or woman, this book will make you laugh and also stop to think about how truly absurd the sexes can most times be.<br />  This is my favorite book EVER!!! I'd give it ten stars if I could., is endearing. <BR>       READ THIS BOOK!!! YOU WON'T REGRET IT!!!

6304681011|4.0|BOY, THIS IS ONE SCARY MOVIE!<br />When I saw this film as a young whippersnapper, it frightened the pants and shirt off of me...leaving me ALMOST naked! In 1990, I bought the vhs tape of this  and it was great to see this movie again. It didn't scare me as much when I watched it again, BUT...it still scared me nonetheless. First, however, the film's flaws.<br /><br />  For one, the acting is atrocious and some of the dialogue is pretty bad. And Mr. Lindsey, the other tenant in the boarding house, is the most annoying character I've encountered in any movie. What a creep this guy is! The actor who plays him does too good of a job portraying him...thank the Lord he never appeared in another movie again! The psychiatrist(or counselor) and the landlady have some very weak lines!<br />  HOWEVER..........<br /> Everything else about this movie is great! The zombies are very frightening, especially that man that the main character keeps seeing...indeed, the zombies may be the best actors in the movie!<br />Candace Hilligoss does a very good job in the lead role..she's quite stunning to look at and makes her character more sympathetic as the movie goes on.<br />  The movie has a very eerie, Twilight Zone feel about it and I like that the movie never really explains itself. David Lynch must have really loved this film. The organ music is very appropriate, tho' it's hard to know when it's being used as background music or when it's actually being heard by the characters in the film.<br />  I highly recommend this movie....<br />It is going to scare you!
B00003CXXS|3.0|This was a good movie to me. This is an example when you have to see for yourself instead of relying on critics to \\"advice\\" you.
0671015206|2.0|The book goes on for about 250 pages talking about how you have to save all of your extra money and invest it in bank accounts to become rich. Well, I think we all knew that saving money was a good thing and we didn't have to read 250 pages to get this. But the book did have some better things to offer. There were some great stories about people that we can al relate to in our lives, the eccentic neighbor, ect., that are all know as millionairs. They have saved up enough assets and have not splurged on anything to the point of becoming millionairs. And it is amazing to see all of the little places where they manage to save money. Maybe only a hundred dollars here, a hundred there, it all adds up and they accumulate for themselves a forturne. This is very interesting and a great way to learn the little things we can do in our lives to save money. Other than that, the book was really bad.
B00006CXXU|3.0|I listened to this album and thought it was pretty good. Beautiful is an incredible song and she sings it perfectly. Other songs such as impossible also display her vocal talents.<BR>Dirrty is ok but not my favorite on the album. The album is worth buying and definately worth listening to!
B00005OAIE|5.0|How nice of Mr. Rickey Wright to cast such a dull shadow on such a great album.  Let me see, last time I checked I'd say this album was doing better than average.  Rickey who?  Just another sad critic that's trying to boost his sad ego at the expense of someone with double the talent.  To hell with the critics, this album is worth its weight in gold.
B00003CXXP|4.0|I thought the ending could have been eliminated. I would have liked to have seen David and Joe continue searching for the blue fairy, as well as find other adventures along the way.  I also thought the two of them &quot;surviving&quot; the freeze would have been a poignant ending to show how man can fail at trying to destroy what he no longer desires.
B00005JL95|5.0|We are definately a t.v. family, that is just what we like to do together is watch movies, we did not hesitate adding this one to our collection.  In July we saw this movie at the theater and it captivated us, there is a simple but magical quality it has.  Disney Movies are beloved in our home but usually not the ones we tend to buy, this one starts a new breed of classics!
B00006879E|5.0|I first heard Maroon 5 when they opened for John Mayer.  John came out and introduced them as his favorite band of the year, and they really were amazing.  The lyrics and the music both touch my soul.  Great for relaxing or getting pumped up.  Definitely worth actually buying the CD.
B00005JKJA|5.0|So... obviously the reviews are greatly divided on this picture.  Why, you may ask?  Well, perhaps everyone is looking at Lynch's work in the wrong way.  To say he is a living genius, and the greatest filmmaker out there today, well, that might be taking it too far.  Yes, he is intelligent and creates more than meets the eye in his films, but the greatest?  And to those who say, this is dribble, well, honestly, not every piece of art is self-explanatory.  The joy of art sometimes, is figuring and deciphering it for yourself.  Take what you will from this film, but do not dismiss it simply because there was no obvious beginning, middle and end.  Using your mind is good occasionallyl.  Just try it.
B00007BH5C|5.0|I absolutely loved \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" soundtrack...so much so that it was a staple on my car CD player for the entire year.  I've pretty much played it to death and couldn't wait to get my hands on \\"The Two Towers\\" soundtrack.<br />And so here it is and it is well worth the wait!  I purchased it when it on the release date and have listened to every day since.  What can I say?  HOWARD SHORE DOES IT AGAIN!  This is a fabulous score....filled with sweeping grandeur, haunting melodies and powerful imagery.  If you enjoyed the FOTR soundtrack or great scores in general, this will not disappoint!<br />I can easily say that this score has got to be one of the best of all time.  In short, I can probably say that this is even better than \\"Fellowship.\\" It ranks up there with other great scores like \\"Gladiator,\\" \\"The English Patient,\\" \\"Titanic\\" and \\"Star Wars.\\"  Totally unforgettable and an instant classic.<br />Some themes from FOTR make their way to this soundtrack (the \\"hobbits\\" theme, echoes of \\"The Bridge of Khazad Dum\\" & \\"Lothlorien,\\"  the \\"fellowship\\" theme, Isengard`s theme) but it definitely is NOT a duplicate of FOTRs.  For one, there is   more vocal work and features such wonderful discoveries as Isabel Bayrakdarian, Ben del Maestro and Emiliana Torrini.  It is totally original.  It feels darker...at times more sinister...grander....more epic...and, towards the end (particularly starting with \\"The Hornburg\\"), completely blows you away!<br />The highlights for me include:<br />* \\"The Riders of Rohan\\" - the dominant theme of the soundtrack is the Rohan theme.  Here we are introduced to the realm of King Theoden and the rohirrim.  We meet Eowyn, Eomer and Wormtongue.  A beautiful instrument called the hardinger is used amply in the Rohan themes and this piece has a sweeping quality to it.<br />* \\"Evenstar\\" - this piece has a completely different feel.  It is softer, Celtic-like and features the amazing voice of newcomer Isabel Bayrakdarian.  No doubt it is atheme for Arwen and the elves. It has a dreamy quality reminiscent of Enya's \\"Aniron\\" from the first film.<br />* \\"Helms Deep\\" - this is where the main conflict begins as the rohirrim make their way to Helms Deep.  Lots of drums, horns and vocal work in this piece to make it totally memorable.  The rohan theme makes its re-appearance.<br />* \\"The Hornburg\\" - this is the climax of the film, as the forces of Rohan, Legolas, Aragorn and Gimli face off with Saruman's army of uruk-hai.  I can almost picture the battle unfold in my mind.  <br />* \\"Forth Eorlingas\\" - the highlight of this piece is Ben del Maestro's haunting voice.  This promising young man has a bright future ahead of him. The sweeping grandeur of the Rohan theme dominates this track.<br />* \\"Isengard Unleashed\\" - this piece begins with Elizabeth Fraser's (who also sang in the \\"Lothlorien\\" piece from the first film) haunting melody...and then the dam breaks!  The ents storm Isengard!  This fantastically layered piece is topped off once again by Ben del Maestro's operatic voice as well as the Isengard theme from the first film.  Clearly this is my favorite piece of the entire score...and will most likely be one of my favorite scenes in the movie as well.  It brings into mind the excitement of the opening battle sequence in \\"Gladiator.\\"  Amazing!<br />* \\"Gollum's Song - this song perfectly encapsulates the torment of Gollum/Smeagol.  It is sad and tragic.  I will be very surprised if Emiliana Torrini doesn't make an appearance at this year's Oscars as this piece deserves to be nominated for Best Song.<br />If you buy only one movie soundtrack this year, \\"The Two Towers\\" by Howard Shore has got to be it.  This is an absolute keeper.  I certainly know what I'll be listening to in the next 12 months...at least until \\"The Return of the King\\" soundtrack comes out!
B00006CXXU|5.0|I think it's a great album. I think Christina has grown up a lot as a recording artist. It is a must buy!
6305558167|5.0|I agree with all the other comments on this film - it's a marvellous film &amp; a terrific movie experience - and I would like to add one point...and correct another.<br />First:  I saw Excalibur for the first time @ a pre-release screening;  when I went to see it w/ friends after general release, I was shocked to see that the film had been significantly changed (edited).  Though still excellent, I've longed to see once again that original, uncut work.<br />This is it.<br />Though there is nothing to reveal that this is a 'director's cut', and not the general-release version, it IS in fact that first, glorious and disturbing vision.<br />Second:  in reviews here, several people have identified Nigel Terry as the actor who portrays Merlin.  This is NOT true.  Terry is a fine actor, and is wonderful in this film, but as Arthur - not Merlin!<br />Merlin is played (exquisitely) by the sensation of Shakespearian London in the '60s, Nicol Williamson.  His performance here is as fine as anything you'll ever see.
B00007BHOE|5.0|i love it it is the best thing slipknot has come out with  in a long time .  THe solos are the best.  The major reason i bought the dvd was to see MY PLAGUE live, because i was very insulted when i saw that watered down version in RESIDENT EVIL.  I love slipknot they are (sic).  One more thing, stop comparing slipknot to mudvayne, they are nothing alike and they should not be compared in any way. Slipknot is simply the best.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|Some things never change and if they do they get better and better. Usually reborn Christians go nuts, singing the glory of the flag and crooning along with the American president; not Johnny Cash. His voice is ripe and emotional, sober and bitter as if this CD might be his swan song. And what a swan song this is: a panorama of the music we were raised on, the music that saved our lives, no less. Gratefulness to Johnny Cash: he makes the world a little more bearable.

It was such a guilty pleasure to read -- when, like Kate, I had Holdiay cards to send, cookies to bake for the school Christmas party and matters of the family to attend to all after coming home from work at 10 pm.  But, I'm not sure I would \\"get\\" this book or enjoy it much if I hadn't already walked a mile in Kate Reddy's shoes.  <br />Of course this book is over the top -- doesn't it have to be to be entertaining?  Even I found myself saying \\"I don't know how she does it.\\"  But there are many thoughts in the book that are right-on and thought provoking.  Take for example Kate Reddy's observation that fathers that leave work early or schedule business around their family commitments are lauded as \\"involved fathers\\" when mothers doing the same are suspected of not being committed to their work or are seen as unreliable or unaccessible.  Whether you are a mom working full-time outside the home or not, this and many other insights in the book highlight interesting social issues.<br />I would be interested to know whether this book appeals to stay-at-home moms. I suspect not based on the fact that many of my own stay-at-home friends have little interest in what my life is like and often think that a mother who works full-time outside the home is akin to a mother who eats her young.<br />As for mothers working full-time outside the home, this book is sure to be a winner and a welcomed comic relief.  As for myself, I plan to give this book to my mother for Christmas to help her understand the dilemmas of being a professional and a mother of young children and the difficulty of \\"having it all\\".
B00006JJ1O|5.0|Ok, so if you're new to TATU (Taty) you'll have to take this review with a bit of back story. The girls of Tatu began and continue their career in the Russian music scene. I was fortunate enough to be turned on to them while living in Russia over a year ago. Their music is well produced, catchy and has to be respected as these girls originally had much of this album<BR>produced in Russian and have taken the time to re-record them in English for the benefit of English speaking countries (namely the US). The best part is that even though I can understand both the English and Russian versions of their songs, I wouldn't need to. Music is universal and the mix of pop, techno and overwhelming angst is enough to get anyone going, no matter what language it's in. There are a couple songs on the album that are in the original Russian, so for those ethnocentric Americans you might be turned off, but remember: the world is a big place FULL of music. If you turn a deaf ear to something new, you might miss something wonderful. This is one such album.
B00006M183|4.0|Ever Since Ten came out back in 1991 every album after has been compared, and mostly criticized other than Vs. Two albums which in my opinion are two of the best albums ever made. Now that is a hard act to follow. But this is Pearl Jam. They do not follow, they go on, and create more music, and never look back. And that is what music is about. You either Stay the same, or you advance. In some band's cases they regress instead of progress. But it would be an insult to the genious of Pearl Jam to say, &quot;you dont sound like Ten, Vs. or even Vitalogy&quot; Well no kidding! With age comes wisdom, and Eddie Vedder shows it on this album. Riot act not only breaks new ground for Pearl Jam musicly but also lyricly. Yes, i miss songs like &quot;Betterman&quot;, &quot;Off he goes&quot;, &quot;Jeremy&quot; and so on. All these songs have profound lyrics that tell a story. But not a personal story about Pearl Jam. In Riot act Eddie Vedder tells you what he has been through, and what he has learned since the very bigining of Pearl Jams awesome 12+ year career. If you listen to what is being sung you realize he is opening a door to his life. From the heartfelt advice on love (&quot;Love Boat Captain&quot;.) To singing about the personal mistakes and ghosts from his past (&quot;Ghost&quot;) And about coming to terms with ones self (&quot;I am mine&quot;) The list goes on and on. This really is a great album. One of the best things to see, is a band grow. There are no moshing songs, or anything that anquished teenagers can relate to. But Over 12 years have passed. Most of you who have been there since the beginning have grown up. And just like you so has Pearl Jam. But that does not mean that the next album wont suprise the hell out of you. That is the beauty of it all. The Sky is the limit. Buy this album and really listen to it. Not just once.. keep playing it. Listen to the lyrics. You will find that Pearl Jam still has the heart, soul and drive that it has always had. Only now it has just been directed in a slightly different direction. Check out &quot;Get Right&quot; for example and Enjoy :)
B000070WJE|4.0|I have to say I was impressed by how different and varied this Robbie Williams' album is in comparison to his earlier works. I enjoyed his previous segue into swing inspired, Sinatra-esque numbers, but fully expected _Escapology_ to be a return to a more formulaic, predictable Robbie style. Nope. This is a somewhat dark, ascerbic album, with notable upbeat exceptions being &quot;Song 3,&quot; &quot;Hot Fudge,&quot; and &quot;Handsome Man.&quot; The lyrics, while still having Robbie's signature arrogant flair, are tempered by a kind of pensive honesty that I liked. As other reviewers have noted, the songs do differ wildly in terms of genre and I don't think this will be the magic bullet that wins over American audiences. But it's America's loss-- I've been a Robbie fan for several years now and I can safely say the American public doesn't know what it is missing. _Escapology_ is a great investment for any Robbie fan or newcomer alike.
B00005OCMR|4.0|I can remember seeing this movie when I was around 5 or 6 and thinking it was the coolest thing ever.  Of course it looks very dated compared with the visual effects of today, but this movie is so original its worth owning. A word of caution to owners of Playstation 2. This movie has a major video glitch that cannot be fixed, in chapter 8 when flynn and RAM are talking the video turns into a grid of little green blocks and the only way to stop it from happening is to fast forward through that part. I would give this 5 stars if not for that problem.
B00006M183|4.0|There've been many reviews about Pearl Jam's debut album, both online here at Amazon and in magazines such as CMJ, Blender and Rolling Stone. The reviews I've read in magazines praise Riot Act as a strong album, a new direction for Pearl Jam, etc. On the other hand, many fans ,or so-called fans, seems to view Pearl Jam as \\"going downhill\\"--or already the bottom, for that matter.<br />Well, I for one, agree with the critics and true Pearl Jam fans. I have been a Pearl Jam fan since the beginning and you won't see me quit these guys -- now or ever. I've been on ebay and people are selling off their cd's and memorabilia, stating, \\"I'm just not into them anymore\\". It's hard to understand for a brief moment, but then I come to terms with the unfortunate reality, and it makes sense. I've realized so many people listen to music for the poppy-garbage-hooks or the artist's (I use that word loosely)appearance or other ridiculous reasons.<br />I listen to music for the complete package--everything. Those booming basslines, insanely fresh lead guitars - soulful and intense, meaningful vocals. And in Pearl Jam's case--they have it all--in spades! I'd rather listen to Pearl Jam tune their instruments than listen to Justin Timberlake or Britney sing about dumb stuff -- my girlfriend dumped me, I just bought a new sweater, etc.---just, stupid s**t.<br />Pearl Jam is not the same band they were 12 years ago and no, they will never put out another \\"Ten\\". But who wants them to? If you do, you may be better off listening to Creed, or Nirvana wantabee's, Puddle of Crudd. Those bands will consistently suck and continue to copy original grunge bands of the 90's and spew out the same old crappy-hooks over and over in their predictable \\"glam-grunge\\" routines. Pearl Jam on the other hand will continue to grow as a band and put out powerful, cerebral music. And that's what I look forward to. That's why I love music.<br />Thanks Mike, Matt, Stone, Eddie and Jeff for a great album!
0140177396|5.0|John Steinbeck has long been among my favorite American authors. I have read &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; and &quot;In Dubious Battle,&quot; not to mention of course the book above, &quot;Of Mice and Men.&quot; This last book, quite a short work, explores a brief period in the lives of two vagrant workers, looking for jobs in California. As the readers soon find, their home, the &quot;land of the free,&quot; is not a paradise of simple people seeking even a decent wage to live by. &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; illuminates the fundamentally brutal nature of American society during the despression, and the effects of this society on every day people, rich or poor. All of my friends in high school, even those who rarely read, loved this book. Anyone who reads this book is a different person afterwards, and I urge you to read it yourself.
0316666343|3.0|The first half of this book is fantastic. The kind of book that you can't put down. It makes you think and turning the pages is a delight. The second half falls flat. It loses something and gets flat and dull and I ended up having to force myself to read it to the end. It's worth reading for the first half of the book. If the writer had given me the book asking for my opinion on it before it was published, I would have told her to throw out the second half of the book, take a break and rewrite it. This book had so much potential, it's sad that it flops the way it does.
B00005JKCH|5.0|By all accounts this was an excellent movie, but it was somewhat disappointing in certain aspects. Tobey Maguire is a good actor, don't get me wrong.. yet he didn't have that superhuman quality that he should've. Spider-Man should've been somebody taller, with a deeper voice, and an unknown. To put a known actor in a movie about a superhero sort of trashes it in ways, like Val Kilmer and George Clooney for the last two installments of the &quot;Batman&quot; series. Every time I saw Clooney, I thought of &quot;E.R.&quot; and &quot;Three Kings&quot;, not the dark knight. But enough about that, the focus of this review is basically how they should've gotten somebody else for the hero besides Tobey Maguire. All-in-all though, I really enjoyed the movie. As to how closely it followed the comics, I think they were very spot-on (with a very small number of exceptions). It's worth getting on DVD or VHS, either way it makes a great addition to anyone's video library.
B000065V1V|4.0|Okay, all you self-proclaimed Bowie fans (and I'm one, too) Heathen is NOT one of<BR>Bowie's best albums. Heathen is good, but it's not great. The Neil Young cover is by far<BR>the outstanding track. But the rest of the album is just okay by Bowie standards (though<BR> it's still much better than a lot of other music out there). It's time to face it, Bowie<BR>is no longer a musical genius. His best years are behind him. He still makes good music<BR>(better than a lot of other new music), but that's it, especially after the departure of 90s<BR>guitarist and collaborator Reeves Gabrels.<br />Ya, that's right, the departure of Gabrels ... <BR>For all you Tin Machine and Earthling nay-sayers, guitarist Reeves Gabrels was one of<BR>the only things that rescued Bowie's otherwise DYING career. The greatest Bowie solo<BR>album since Scary Monsters is Earthling, with its dynamic experimentation, edgy<BR>songwriting, and guitar squalls. So many fans are nostalgic about the stylishly cutting-edge<BR>Bowie of the 70s (which is fine in itself, I am too). But it seems blatantly hypocritical<BR>when the same fans turn around and criticize an album like Earthling (1997) for being too<BR>stylish and edgy, and proclaim Heathen as some sort of comforting relief. What?!<BR>Memorable Bowie is all about style and taking chances, not comfort--pay attention! <br />And Tin Machine (1989), which for some reason always gets criticized when talking<BR>about newer Bowie albums, was also an experiment and a necessary departure. The<BR>project came from Bowie's need to shake off his 80's pop vibe and get back to earlier<BR>influences such as Velvet Underground. Any casual dismissal of Tin Machine just<BR>illustrates how little some self-proclaimed \\"hard-core\\" fans really understand Bowie. <br />By the way, Bowie performs a couple of songs on the solo works of Reeves Gabrels.<BR>After listening to this work, I wish Bowie had let Gabrels produce an album his way and<BR>Bowie just write lyrics and sing. David might have explored more about himself as an<BR>artist-as he did earlier in his career--instead of being preoccupied with preserving his<BR>persona and being comfortable--as he is now.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|This CD is one of the best CDs I have ever bought. I love all of the tracks but my favorite would have to be Malchik Gay. The bass line and tatu's voices blend so well. This cd is a hard mix of pop and techno. Also, the lyrics are unbelievable. They have such meaning. Great job tatu! I highly suggest this cd to anyone.
B00005JL78|3.0|Despite the unfortunate fact that the villian of the movie can be determined within the first 15 minutes, this is an excellent flick that caters to my personal Johnson of time travel.  The implications of knowing the future and the paradoxes created by altering the forseen are wonderfully explored - until the last 15 minutes.  At that point, what I like to call the &quot;Spielberg AI Complex&quot; sets in and the movie wraps up all of the loose ends in a happy fashion.  Everybody gets what's coming to them and all is right with the world.  It's all a little too Disney for my taste and seriously detracts from what could've been a top-10 all time film.
B00005JL3A|1.0|I've been a fan of the console version of \\"Resident Evil\\" ever since it was released on Playstation. However, the live-action production was an EXTREME disappointment. They basically mutilated the video game story (which was brilliant by the way), and turned it into this new-age pile of .... Combined with a thrown together plot, terrible acting, and having not one solitary *scary* moment, this movie looked bad next to digestive waste.<BR>I mean c'mon; where's the S.T.A.R.S. team? Where's the spooky libraries and bloodthirsty crows? I certainly don't recall any computerized defense system in the video game mansion. It was simple; savage dobermans, cannibalistic zombies, and numerous random monsters created by the T-virus. The game was thrilling, it had a style unlike any other console thriller ever created. It gave people goosebumps, it made you afraid to walk down dark hallways after you played it, and for the more timid, yet determined gamers, it made you do things such as sleep with some sort of weapon next to you, and the lights turned on. But this movie, every single shred of it was horrifying - horrifyingly stupid, that is. If the rating system could go any lower, I'd rate this movie about a negative 3 stars. I'm ashamed I actually bought a ticket to go see it, may the lord forgive me for being such an imbecile.
0380788624|1.0|Where to begin-- I am no computer scientist, and care not for any mistakes Stephenson may have made in the accuracy department, but as a work of fiction, this fails.  I am a sci-fi fan, and actually enjoyed &quot;The Diamond Age&quot; by the same author.  But the weak points in that novel became the focal point in this monstrosity.  Convoluted plot- fine.  Dissapointing ending- okay.  But things for which the author cannot be forgiven:<BR>- endlessly showing off in long passages that I only hope are correct-- dealing with mathematical formulas and computer designs.  I know this is a book about crypto-- it's not the fact that he's figured something out that bugs me.  It's the characters launching, at the drop of a hat, into a lecture to explain it---to each other!  For example : at the gathering of Randy's family to distribute the matriarch's possessions.  The characters (or wooden author-puppets), pipe up and excitedly discuss how an algorithm can help them distribute the goods. One of these characters supposedly spent an entire day fighting about some dresser. I mean, if Stephenson wanted to write a math book, he should have just done it.  He has committed the most grievous (and lengthy) sin of having his characters be transparent mouthpieces for his ideas, that I have ever come across.  I literally would lose track of who's talking in a given scene, because the narrative voice of any character is the same as any other!  The only reason I could identify Bobby Shaftoe was his habit of shouting &quot;sir, yes sir!&quot;<br />I would have enjoyed this book more if the author had tried a little harder to create charaters, rather than just jotting down what seemed to be notes for a future book.  I could have cared less if the entire cast of the story was blown up in the final scene-- why would it matter?  I have never come across such blatant author-mouthpieces before, and I hope I never do again.  I haven't given up all hope for this author, because he is witty and hasclever ideas.  I just wouldn't call this one fiction.
B00007DWRZ|5.0|This CD is playing in every store, restaurant, radio station in Brazil right now.  It is fantastic, so sweet and funny and smart.  The three singers really get along well together.  Let's hope that this is not their last CD - although they suggest that it is in their last track, \\"Tribalistas,\\" where they threaten to \\"desintegrar no proximo momento.\\"!
B00000F1D3|5.0|Cher's album Believe was touted as the comeback album of a lifetime.  That must be the understatement of the year because this album is simply amazing! Cher is vibrant and full of life throughout her \\"Believe\\" album. With vocals that are stronger than ever and great production, this album becomes one of Cher's best efforts in quite some time. The title track and opener for the album was Billboard's highest rated single in 1999.  \\"Believe\\" is sure to follow Cher as her greatest single and album of all time.  Even with her new album, \\"Living Proof\\", it still looms in the background.  This album deals mostly in electronic vocals and beats, which is obviously a very successful combination.  I would like to have seen \\"Runaway\\" become a single but the album still soars.  The best tracks are Believe, Runaway, All or Nothing, Strong Enough, and Love is the Groove.  If you like this album, buy the Believe Tour DVD/VHS.  Cher is even better in concert!  Cher may be approaching her late 50s, but she is the ultimate diva when it comes to singing/performing.  Long live Cher!!!!

B000002MFN|5.0|While people did not like this album at the time, and was overshadowed by her \\"SEX\\" book and her movie 'Body of Evidence' This album is one of Madonna's best albums yet. Go out and buy it!
B0000027RL|2.0|I'll get straight to the point. The musicianship is absolutely atrocious: aside from a few solos, the guitarists sound like they can't play at all. The drumming is unbearably simple. David Grohl who used to drum in Nirvana can slaughter this drummer without trying. Eddie Vedder can barely sing, although it is nice that he has influenced much better vocalists such as Aaron Lewis (Staind) and Scoot Ward (Cold). With poor production, the music is boring to listen to. The lyrics seem to be most of the focus in praise for this, but I say nonsense unto you. Lyrics are profane and try too hard to be arty or thought-provoking. <br />I will conclude by saying that if you wan't to hear anything average from Pearl Jam, try their \\"underground\\" followup to this. There is more straight rock in it and not as many MTV cliches.
B00002MZ2T|5.0|Savage Garden has most definately out-done themselves on this album.  If you haven't bought this album and are even considering it, don't read any further.  Just stop, save you eyes, and buy this album! Their first album was good but I couldn't put it in the player and listen the entire way through without getting bored.  On this album (Affirmation) I can put it in and listen to every single song.  It's rare these days with factory pop becoming so popular that you can buy album, put it in the player, and listen to every song over and over again.  I found that I can only do that with Cher, Eminem, Missy Elliot, TLC, and Marilyn Manson.  Well, now this album can be added to that list.  The songs has such stong messages behind them that you will undoubtably be hooked!  The songs are as follows:<br />1. Affirmation: A nice, very upbeat song to start the album off with.  Basically singing about everything that he believes to be true.  Hence the title \\"Affirmation\\".<br />2. Hold Me: Not as upbeat as the first song but keeps with the faster pace.  Good message behind this song.  \\"I need you to hold me tonight.\\"<br />3. I Knew I Loved You: Everyone has heard this song.  It's the first single off of the album and it's a ballad.  I actually sung this song at a solo concert some time ago, so it has a special meaning to me.<br />4. The Best Thing: This is my favorite up-tempo song on this album. I replay this song over and over and I'm sure you will love it to if you like dance music.  Perfect song!<br />5. Crash And Burn: This song is an inspirational song about someone always being there for you.  \\"When you feel all alone and the world has turned its back on you.\\"  This was a single from the album and it is no suprise because it's great. It's a mid-tempo song.<br />6. Chained To You: Another dance song or fast paced song.  Definately a very different song with a mention of dancing to Madonna.  Another great addition to the album.<br />7. The Animal Song:  Featured on the soundtrack to \\"The Other Sister\\", this song was also a single from the album. Again, it is upbeat and the lyrics are uplifting.  This is another personal favorite of mine.  It's basically about how this world is annoying and he wants to live crazy and free.<br />8. The Lover After Me: Now we slow down a bit.  This is a sad song about lost love.  How his lover has moved on but he stills feel the exact same.  Very good and touching song.<br />9. Two Bed And A Coffee Machine: Ok, strange title but best song on the album!  It's about an abusive relationship and the person moving on with the kids and belongings.  Very sad and touching at the same time.  Even if you don't like slow songs, try this one out.  If not for the music, then the meaning behind the words.<br />10. You Can Still Be Free: Another slower song.  The album is beginning to slow down but that's not necessarily bad.  This song is about becoming free from your life.  That is definately a reoccuring theme on this album.<br />11. Gunning Down Romance: Another slower song. I don't really care much for this one.  It doesn't have anything special that grabs my attention, but it's alright for a slow song. I would probably give this a 4/10.<br />I Don't Know You Anymore: The album ends with a slower song but they are back to excellent song writing.  This is another favorite song of mine that is slower.  There is something about this song that will just hook you, and his vocals are amazing on this song.  \\"I don't know you anymore, I don't recognize this place. We keep running from the pain and I see your face again.\\"<br />This album is a masterpiece!  It's one of the most own albums of 1999. It has something for everyone and it is not just factory pop music.  The lyrics are inspiring and sad, interesting and entertaining.  It's rare to find such a great album, so buy this.  I guarantee that you won't be disappointed.  All of us reviewers can't be wrong.  There is definately something here!!!
B00005JL78|5.0|I just bought the movie on DVD today, and as soon as I pressed play I was glued to the couch. To be somewhat blunt, I was saturated with intrigue within the first 10 minutes. The visual effects are astonishing, the plot is so thick and complex it makes your head hurt. Every aspect of the story is flawless, and the acting is excellent. Every time I thought the movie was slowing down, it would at any given moment jump back into a whirlwind of action and mystery. You never fully understand the whole plot until near the very end, but watching the entire film to find out what's going on is most certainly worth the time. I was skeptical of this movie before I saw it; everyone I asked about it said it was disappointing. Personally, I think it was marvelously impressive... a *MUST-HAVE* on DVD. <BR>Kudos to the entire cast and crew that assembled this masterpiece.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|I Love T.A.T.U, as is i am from poland and got the cd there over the summer, in russian. Needless to say my russian improved and I am jumping for joy now that the cd has come out here in the states. This CD is a killer, I've gotten all my friends into it, and now the whole U.S can get in on it. I love it, everyone should have a copy! I swear if you buy this cd you wont be let down... SO WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR!

B00006RU5B|5.0|AUDIOSLAVE is right on target with this album!Chris Cornell exploits his raw tallented vocals(man this guy can sing!!)and song writing abillity to collaberate with the magically instrumental members of RATM. Tom Morello is genious, as are the other two Tim commerford and Brad Wilks. Since I have bought this album I have listened to it everytime I am in my car, when i go to bed at night, and use it to wake me up in the morning. It's almost like they decided to make their greatest hits their very first album. It's that good! Don't judge this band based on their former groups, because it is a new band with a unique style of sounds and vocal's that rock n roll fans have been begging for for many years now. If you enjoy a band that actually has a talented lead singer who can deliver a beautiful tone and then scream his lungs out, and sound so cool while doing it along with a talented group of instrumentalists, you'll love it. Although they sound nothing alike, it's kind of like Steve Tyler with his unbelievable vocals accompanied by Joe Perry's unbelievable guitar skills. I'd give this cd a 10 star rating if possible. Get out and get it today, because if you don't have it already, your missing out on an instant rock classic.
0066214122|3.0|Since you can read about characters, themes and storylines elsewhere let me go right to the point: what kind of reading experience does this book provide? Crichton is always best read for the way he handles plot, he is a master of the cliff-hanger.  At the end of chapters, and, in this novel, even in the small subsections of the chapters, Crichton manages some real zingers that propel the reader to turn page after page.  However be cautioned, nearly a third of the novel is a waist of time.  For example, the opening chapters while providing some set up, drag due to trite humor about the central character's life as a stay-at-home dad.  But the real flaw is a final section that stretches credulity beyond the limits, falling to the level of C grade sci-fi horror.  There's even goo involved!  The other two thirds crackle along at a very entertaining pace, amusing the reader in the best Crichton fashion.  Not a total loss, but not his best.

B000000W5L|5.0|For decades, it has been a truism that Exile on Main Street is the greatest album the Stones ever made, and that after this album, their career has gone slowly but exorably downhill.  Lately I've seen posts on this and other sites challenging \\"Exile,\\" saying essentially that the album is wildly overrated, and doesn't have the songs that other Stones albums have--\\"Beggars Banquet,\\" \\"Let it Bleed\\" \\"Sticky Fingers\\" \\"Some Girls\\" and even \\"Goats Head Soup\\" getting the nods from these revisionist thinkers.<br />They have half a point, these folks.  There is nothing that hits the incredible highs of \\"Gimme Shelter,\\" \\"Street Fighting Man,\\" \\"Brown Sugar,\\" \\"Angie,\\" \\"Beast of Burden,\\" \\"Wild Horse\\" or \\"Shattered\\" on this album. The two hits that this album generated, \\"Tumbling Dice\\" and \\"Happy\\" are much-loved, but didn't have the impact of the above singles.  And against their earlier 60s hits like \\"Paint it Black\\" or \\"Satisfaction\\"--forget it.<br />All that's granted. If someone wanted to be very reductive, much of \\"Exiles...\\" just sounds like a boogie album typical of its era--in the early 70s there was sort of a roots revival going on, so lots of bands were doing a sort of combination of blues and gospel with lots of tambourines shaking, pianos rolling, and backup women singers. Stretches of \\"Exile...\\" certainly have that Delaney and Bonnie feel.  Other songs sound like attempts to emulate early Little Feat, or Gram Parsons, who famously partied with Keith throughout the making of some of this album.<br />So what makes this album their greatest?<br />It's hard to describe, but here's my best shot: It's about \\"feel.\\"  Never before or since did the Stones manage to create such a consistent and compelling mood that lasts from the first song to the last.  It is a very naked album, both musically and lyrically.  I know it was worked and worked, but the result is an album that sounds like the Stones are playing not in some French basement, but in YOUR basement.  And, on this album like no other, they are singing their lives.  The songs are grooves over which Mick and Keith simply testify as to what's rattling around their heads--encounters with women, thoughts on life as a rock and roller, spiritual, moral and political questions, from the sublime to the obscene. In its own way, this is a \\"confessional\\" album like Joni Mitchell's \\"Blue\\" or Neil Young's \\"Harvest,\\" except unlike those two artists who equate honesty with a quiet and stripped down musical approach, the Stones say what's in their hearts to a rocking beat.  And, they don't glorify it.  \\"I only get my rocks off when I'm sleeping.\\"  They are nostaglic, isolated, scared, bored, tired, loaded, wondering what will happen to them, recognizing that this life they are leading is artificial and perhaps even dangerous, but a mystery.  So they lean on that backbeat and those fat chords, and seemingly just spill all of it, in an almost stream of consciousness way.<br />To me, \\"Exile on Main Street\\" is really just one long song that carries the album's title, a self-contradicting phrase (like \\"Hide in Plain Sight\\") that evokes a peculiar sense of paranoia that only a bunch of guys who became international superstars would feel, that sense that here you are in plain sight for everyone to see, but you're gone, you don't live in the same world as your fans anymore, the pleasures of ordinary life have been ripped away and replaced with something that may be much better in some ways, enviable, yes, but also frightening and hard to decipher.<br />Musically, when you compare \\"Exile...\\" with other Stones albums, the main difference I find is that most other Stones albums are highly eclectic.  Take \\"Sticky Fingers.\\"  You get some great rock songs, but you also get a jazzy, Latin-tinged jam, some country songs, some orchestral numbers--the mood changes radically several times, and in the end, it's just a collection of great songs without any particular theme.  Ditto with \\"Let it Bleed,\\" \\"Beggars Banquet\\" or \\"Goats Head Soup\\"--Fantastic albums with lots of great songs, but somewhat randomly assembled musically.  I go to those albums for songs that I want to hear, and don't always track them all the way through.  But lovers of \\"Exile...\\" usually start at the beginning and just follow it all the way through, like a movie.  And man, it delivers. And today, 30 years on, it still sounds very fresh.<br />In my personal little list of the greatest rock albums, this is one of the top 10, along with \\"Revolver,\\" \\"John Wesley Harding,\\" \\"London Calling,\\" \\"St. Dominic's Preview,\\" \\"Pet Sounds,\\" \\"Songs in the Key of Life,\\" \\"Blood on the Tracks,\\" and the aforementioned \\"Blue.\\"  And like all of them, \\"Exiles...\\" comes from the heart, and that's what makes it great.rs Banquet\\" or \\"Goats Head Soup\\"--Fantastic albums with lots of great songs, but somewhat randomly assembled musically.

1577311523|5.0|I found this incredible book when it first appeared almost 3 years ago.  Since then I have been an avid \\"practitioner\\" of this most beautiful and natural state called presence.  I have seen Eckhart Tolle in person a dozen times.  I feel really sad when I see a review from someone who has not experienced not only the state which  Eckhart so gently leads you to, but also does not recognize this gentle, amazing man who has what we all want and only wants to show us how to find it.  He is the most selfless, egoless person I have ever known.  He is pure love, as only you can be when there is nothing left of you but God.  Presence is in his voice, in his tapes.  I urge you to listen to Ekchart before you make any judgment about his teaching.  There are some short audio sequences on his website at eckharttolle.com.  <BR>    My life is overflowing with peace and joy as a result of believing in his teaching, and following his simple practices.
0066620996|4.0|Jim Collins new book is titled Good To Great. If you haven't read it yet, buy, beg, or borrow it. It is that important if you are in any business. <BR>Collins and his team identified 11 companies that followed a pattern of \\"fifteen-year cumulative stock returns at or below the general stock market, punctuated by a transition point, then cumulative returns at least three times the market over the next fifteen years.\\" Public companies were selected because of the availability of comparable data. Fifteen-year segments were selected to weed out the one-hit wonders and luck breaks. While these selection criteria exclude \\"new economy\\" companies, Collins contends that there is nothing new about the new economy, citing earlier technology innovations of electricity, the telephone, and the transistor.Collins maps out three stages, each with two key concepts. These six concepts are the heart of Good To Great and he devotes a chapter to explaining each of them. <BR>1) Level 5 Leadership <BR>2) First Who... Then What <BR>3) Confront the Brutal Facts <BR>4) The Hedgehog Concept <BR>5) A Culture of Discipline <BR>6) Technology Accelerators <br />In this book, Jim Collins also challenges the notion that \\"people are your most important asset\\" and theorizes instead that \\"the right people are.\\" I don't know that I yet completely agree with his philosophy that it's more important to get the right people on the bus and then see where it goes than it is to figure out where to go and get the right people on the bus who can get you there. However, he makes his point clearly and you can decide if you agree with him.<BR>This nearly 300-page book is packed with leading edge thinking, clear examples, and data to support the conclusions. It is a challenge to all business leaders to depict the discipline required to move their companies from Good To Great. <BR>With this type of book one can always argue that the author is just writing up common sense ideas. Of course, but common sense is hard tofind sometimes. What Collins did is to study companies that made a dramatic transition. Looking at companies commulative stock returns, compare with the market and direct comparison companies, Collins identify companies that, at some transition point, resulted in great performances compare with all others. Specifically, at least three times the market performance over fifteen years.<BR>What I have here are some notes from the keypoints in the book for myself. You really need to read the entire book to understand what this is all about!
B00006CXXU|5.0|This CD is fantastic. I've always liked Christina - I own her first CD, and think it's good, but this completely blows away everything she has ever done before. It's amazing! There's a very diverse mix of different styles, and the only song out of 20 that I don't like is Dirrty. The rest of them are off-the-hook! <BR>RaTiNgS aRe OuT oF fIvE sTaRs<BR>STRIPPED INTRO - This song is good, albeit very short. I don't really like the jumbled beginning, but once Christina starts speaking, it's great. (3.5 stars)<BR>CAN'T HOLD US DOWN - A very nice duet with Lil' Kim. A very feminist song, which is excellent. It's very catchy, kind of r&b/hip-hop. Girl power!!! (4.5 stars)<BR>WALK AWAY - Great song. The verses, particularly the first one, remind me a bit of Pink's \\"Just Like A Pill\\" - soft, low, a bit raspy. Then the chorus is clear, heartfelt, expressive, strong, and moving. (4.5 stars)<BR>FIGHTER - Excellent! This is a very fast-paced, explosive, anger-fueled rock song, about looking at a breakup from the perspective that it's a GOOD thing, because it makes you stronger. (5 stars)<BR>INFATUATION - A very catchy, fast-paced, pop-rock-ish song. The chorus zigzags between English and Spanish, which I think is a nice touch. The melody is very good, and the lyrics are very realistic. (5 stars)<BR>LOVING ME 4 ME - A very heartfelt, emotional ballad about a partner who accepts and loves you exactly as you are. A little too slow for my taste, but a very good song regardless. (4 stars)<BR>IMPOSSIBLE - Very bluesy; very Alicia Keys-ish, which makes sense, since this song is a duet with Alicia. It provides a good basis for a good, powerful song, but sinks into endless repetitions of the same idea. (3 stars)<BR>UNDERAPPRECIATED - Love it! It's very catchy. Listeners can relate to it quite easily. (4.5 stars)<BR>BEAUTIFUL - Possibly my favorite song on the entire CD. It's so heartfelt, moving, and inspirational. I love how in the first chorus she says, \\"I am beautiful, no matter what they say...,\\" then in the second chorus she says, \\"YOU are beautiful...\\" and in the third she says, \\"WE are beautiful.\\" It really makes you feel like part of the song. Incredible! (5 stars)<BR>MAKE OVER - Very good! An anger-fueled rock song that reminds me incredibly of Sheryl Crow: the catchy, fast paced verses leading into high-pitched, powerful choruses. (5 stars)<BR>CRUZ - Slightly repetitive, but over all very good. Very heartfelt. (4 stars)<BR>SOAR - A powerful, emotional ballad. (4.5 stars)<BR>GET MINE, GET YOURS - Excellent melody, but I don't like the message. \\"I want your body, not your heart?\\" HUH? I disagree. (3 stars)<BR>DIRRTY: In my opinion, this is the one and only real flop. It's to rap-oriented and raunchy. It's also too repetitive. (1.5 stars)<BR>STRIPPED PART 2: Very good! The same melody and general message as the best section of the Stripped Intro. (5 stars)<BR>THE VOICE WITHIN: Great message, great tune, very soulful and heartfelt. (4.5 stars)<BR>I'M OK: Without a doubt the most heart-wrenching, moving song on the CD, written about her childhood, growing up with a physically abusive father. Her mind-boggling voice sends chills down my spine. (5 stars)<BR>KEEP ON SINGING MY SONG: Very good message, about staying true to yourself. I like it a lot. It starts out a bit slow, but gets on track later on. (4 stars)<br />Overall, this is a fantastic CD. Of course, it helps that she has the best voice of any singer I have ever heard in my entire life, but in general, this is an incredibly strong, well thought out, heartfelt, real CD. I highly recommend it.
B00005JKTE|5.0|Do not buy this movie if you love battle scenes and action, action, and more action in your war movies. If you have a thing for gore and carnage, you will be very disappointed.<br />The main focus of this movie is not the war in itself, but the effects of the war on people's lives, which is the only reason I have a thing for war stories. It is amazing to see ordinary people transformed into courageous heroes just for survival. <br />This story is mainly a romance, in my opinion. Charlotte is willing to risk her life to travel to France in search of her lover, a pilot who went down over France and who is now trapped in its borders. But she is distracted from her mission by the plight of two little Jewish boys whose parents have been arrested. She and a handsome ally take the boys into hiding and care for them. But there are spies and informers everywhere who are more than willing to betray their former friends and neighbors. Charlotte finds her loyalties torn between two countries, two identities, and two men.<br />It was a lovely movie with great acting, a wonderful plot, breathtaking scenery, and best of all, it ends like it should. I would give it more than five stars, if I could.
B000075BFK|5.0|The thing is that tupac is not dead the goverment is dead and now that there is new songs that tells you two things one either he's dead or not two and if he is dead the his soul is still living and it is helping others feat wit there fears but the artist thats about his struggles with other rappers and as said if he was alive today as everyone says he is dead he would defat any rapper he is a lenged and he is lookin over everyone so watch for the light
B00006CYAD|5.0|i really enjoyed this cd when i first heard the sond i'd do anything i just fell in love with it and i knew i had to buy the cd and it has become one of my favorite cds. the cd is great to listen to from number 1 to number 12 it is a great and enjoyable cd. since i have bought the cd they have become my favorite band i would really like to see them in concert. i seen them on trl and they are hillarious trying to say about. they are a great band and they were the ones that helped avril lavigne get discovered and they are a great band. if i were you i would go out and buy this cd. if you like them get the new found glory sticks and stones.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|I widely recommend you this cd because you can hear it from the beginning to the end and you would never want to skip any track. It's not the typical american production and you will find that these girls aren't famous just because of their controversial lives, but for their voice talent and the way they can show their feelings and make you fell the same while singing.  Besides it was a great idea from Universal to include an interactive track as a bonus gift to all the fans.
B000069CWE|5.0|I would like to contradict several reviews I read: I don't believe that Linkin Park were lazy, and didn't have the mental strength to write new songs. Instead, they went back to the studio, and made their album a whole lot better. <BR>One can only imagine the work those bands put in the process of making an album, and as for Reanimation, all the more so.<BR>Almost Finally, the guest appearances really contribute to the diversity of Linkin Park. <BR>Frankly, I haven't listened to Hybrid Theory, as much as I loved it, since I've heard Renoimation.
B000069AUI|5.0|I can't describe this CD. It's exactly what I needed.<br />Better that the last one, it's more dinamic and constant.<br />I hope they remain silent for 2 or 3 years so I can really enjoy this one, and not fall in the &quot;one-a-year&quot; category. This was how the great classics were maid.<br />Check the live concerts... pretty damn good!<br />As a comparison - I love the &quot;new&quot; Alanis and the &quot;old&quot; OK Computer(Radiohead).
B00005JL2O|4.0|...because I don't know where Mike Myers and Jay Roach can go from here. The cameos were outstanding. The film combines elements from the first two films but it had a strange but fresh feel to it (e.g. Lack of psychedelic breaks). Michael Caine was wonderful as Austin's father (Caine's Harry Palmer was one of the main influences of Myers which helped him create AP). Personally, I think that Myers should retire AP because of two words: SCOTTY DON'T!!The DVD is loaded with extras, but I agree that not being able to scan forward and backward is inexcusable.
6304493738|5.0|I consider this movie to be one of the greatest thrillers of the 90's.  You never know where the action is going to turn and there is never a dull moment.  The action is told from the point of view of the sole survivor of gang.  He and the story he reveals will have you guessing about the ending and your answer will always be wrong.  The movie is fun but scary in a freaky kind of way at the same time Great performances all around, this kinda reminds me of \\"The Long Kiss Goodnight\\" <br />Overall-If you are looking for a good movie get this

B00005JLRR|3.0|Star Trek: Nemesis is definitely not the worst Trek film to date (That distinction would go to Insurrection or Final Frontier). But it's also nowhere near the best. Falling smack dab in the midst of mediocrity, this film is crying to be great but feels like a paint by numbers Van Gough.<br />Centered on the story of a subclass of Romulans gaining control of its council with the intent of taking over the Federation, the film follows the generation crowd at a time of change as second in command Will Riker and his new wife, ship's counselor Deana Troi, ready to leave the crew. It seems like the over-all theme of the film is supposed to be endings and new beginnings, but that bittersweet concept seems lost in the mostly uninteresting Romulan plot line. What is most frustrating though, is while Nemesis is better then the last Trek film, Insurrection, it had potential to be one of the best of the series. Instead the great scenes are hidden behind the tedious plot. Excellent character moments are screaming to get out, but are replaced either by boring plot developments or ill-placed comedic relief.<br />On the flip side, the special effects are probably some of the best Trek effects yet. But as is becoming more and more evident in modern film, effects don't make a good movie. There are also some fun cameos early on in during what is probably the best scene. In fact, the first fifteen minutes of the movie seemed like it was headed in the right direction. But that was all before the plot took a death grip on it.<br />If Nemesis' story could be related to any other Trek film, it would be that of The Wrath of Kahn, with its similar plot and structure. But this latest seems to be only a pale imitation of Kahn's brilliance. Definitely worth skipping until the video is released, except for the die-hard Trekkies.
B00005JL96|5.0|I had been putting off seeing Lilo and Stitch in the theater because the art did not appeal to me. (Speaking from an artists' perspective, the little blue creature looked sort of like a pokemon rip off and the drawings of Nani and her sister Lilo were too exaggerated for me to enjoy).<br />Well, I was DEAD WRONG. Lilo and Stitch is a humorous and moving film about the love of a little girl for her pet monster, and the love of her big sister Nani, for the little girl.<br />This film brings to question, Nature versus Nurture: Stitch is a creature created to 'destroy worlds,' who is born 'bad.' Through the love of his human adopted family, he learns the values of caring and responsibility.  Even thought the antics of Stitch and Lilo were amusing, the true hero of this movie is actually Nani. Nani works very hard to do everything she can to procure a job and save her sister. Unfortunately, Stitch and Lilo thwart her at every turn, with (at times) disastrous consequences.<br />Again, speaking as an artist, some of the character designs were too exaggerated for me to enjoy fully. Particularly the way the noses were drawn, and some of the disproportionate large heads, were incongruous with the rest of the work.<br />On a positive note,  I REALLY loved the way water was drawn, and the water-color backgrounds were beautiful. Also, Nani and her boyfriend David were well-animated. (This studio is famous for not drawing male characters all that well). Overall, great work. Can't wait for a sequel... Just as long as its not 'direct to video'..... LOL
B000005JA8|1.0|Whatever it is, it isnt at all pleasant to listen to - kind of like a song about a train wreck being played during an actual train wreck.  Theres definitely a lot of hyperbole flowing on this site; Id like to ask: if this is the best that music can hope to sound like, what is the worst?  I sincerely hope that this aspect of progressive, experimental music goes the way of eugenics and phrenology.  It might have seemed advanced at the time, but it looks more and more like a train wreck in hindsight...
B00006RU5B|5.0|For years I have always been wanting something better for Rage Against the Machine. After their magnificent self-titled debut, they seemed to sink into a rut that, until their demise, they never seemed to recover from (Face it, all the albums that followed their debut were inferior). So when a vocalist spot was open for RATM, my mind was on fire with the possiblities. When they had finally confirmed ex-Soundgarden frontman Chris Cornell as their new vocalist, I was in heaven. With one of the best (musically) bands of the 90's combined with my favorite vocalist, I patiently awaited Audioslave's debut. A temporary break-up and too many delays later, Audioslave unleash their new sound upon the world. I for one, am not disappointed. This CD is one more for the Soundgarden fans than the RATM fans. If you liked Soundgarden's last album &quot;Down on the Upside&quot; or Cornell's solo outing &quot;Euphoria Morning&quot; then this will be right up your alley. Chris Cornell effortlessly wails his way through all 14 tracks, while Morello, Commerford and Wilk outdo all of their previous work. This, my friends, is the ultimate marriage. Some songs have typical &quot;Rage-isms,&quot; such as the lead track &quot;Cochise&quot; and &quot;Set It Off,&quot; which almost sounds like Soundgarden doing a RATM cover. However, other tracks such as &quot;Like A Stone&quot; and &quot;Shadow on the Sun&quot; call back to the psychadelic-grunge glory days of Soundgarden and have the band doing things that their place in Rage Against the Machine would not have allowed them to do. Aside from the title of &quot;Cochise,&quot; there really is no political agenda here, which is good, because after 3 albums of &quot;this country is worthless and cop-killers don't deserve to be in jail&quot; a change is welcome. Audioslave might not strike a chord with everyone. It's all dependent upon what you want to get out of the experience. If you are looking for the fifth Rage Against the Machine album, look here and you will be disappointed. But if you miss the REAL, honest grunge of the early 90's, this CD will send shivers down your spine.

B000002KHH|2.0|Dear Warner Brothers Records:<br />Please find out what the word &quot;remaster&quot; means in industry lingo. It's obvious that you have no clue. This CD was released in 1990, for crying out loud. Just get the original master tapes and release a new, better, cleaner Paranoid CD. You can also include a few bonus tracks and extensive liner notes to further entice consumers. It's benefitial for you, because you can get people to buy a CD that they already own, and it's benefitial to music fans because they get much better sound quality and some extras. <br />Please take a look at Columbia/Legacy's remasters of The Byrds' catalog to see how it should be done. You will make many music fans very happy if you start remastering your artists' catalogs. Especially ZZ Top, but that's a different matter. <br />I'm waiting patiently for remastered Black Sabbath albums. Don't disappoint me.
B00006L9ZT|2.0|The production of this Ring cycle is OK for me. It's not very interesting, but it's also true to the spirit of Wagner's work. <br />I'm however disappointed by the performance. I know that there're different views as regards James Levine conducting and I belong to the group who found him disappointing. The speed that he adopts is far too slow and lifeless, which renders the performance a plodding one. The singers are not that outstanding with a few who're below their best, including some in the major roles. <br />I don't think this is a very inspiring and invigorating performance.
B000066F6H|5.0|Not since AC/DC has a band come along that was just pure unadulterated rock.  The Hives along with there contemporaries, The Strokes, The White Stripes, The Flaming Sideburns, and The Vines, have hopefully put the final nail in the Pop Music Coffin of the late 90's.
B00004YWAG|5.0|This is an excelent demonstration of how beautiful and modern is the music of Renaissance. I think it will be a nice surprise for undevoted. I advise this CD for everyone, it's really superb!!!
B000001ELD|4.0|Unlike Ace and Paul, Gene and Peter seemed to truly understand the idea behind the 'solo' albums.  It was to let them each create without having the others critique, something that would never happen on a Kiss record.  The 1,000,000 copy release of each of the four albums almost bankrupt the band and Casablanca Records, with Ace scoring the only hit, but the songs on Gene's and especially Peter's albums showed something that at that time was far removed from the standard Kiss rock tunes.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|This CD is one of the best I've ever listened to. I heard it at a friend's house and can't wait to get my own copy. &quot;All The Things She Said&quot; is definitely the best song on the CD. Tatu is one of the best bands ever.
B00006SFBD|5.0|I'll not shower this album with more accolades, read the other 5 star reviews, I'll just say 'thank you' to the guys in the band for creating this work.  Keep doing this and I'll keep throwing money at you!
B00006JJ1O|4.0|When I first laid eyes on this item sitting on the shelf, I had extremley mixed feelings. I have been listening to t.A.T.u for about a year now and the entire time I have listened to them in russian, sometime over the summer I heard \\"All the things she said\\" which for those who don't know, is the english version of Ya Soshla S Uma.  I have to say I miss the sing song quality of the russian lyrics on some of the songs, but it really is great to finally be able to understand what they are saying without having to look it up!  (the translations get a little crazy)  I had to laugh at their cover of track number 5, i don't rember the name.. because a mix of that is the theme song for charmed, but it was well done by Yulia and Lena.. Out of the entire albumn I particularly loved the adaptations of Malchik gey (boy gay) , and klouni (clowns) the lyrics and slightly altered, in the case of malchik gey, melody lines were excellently done and I prefer the english version of these two over their russian predecesors, I also appreciated how they included two of the russian tracks on the cd, in order to give people a taste of the authentic tatu in their native language.. All in all I think this cd is especially great for hooking new fans, I've got at least ten girls who all want to go out and buy it, after hearing all the things she said.  But if you really want to hear all t.A.T.u has to give, it is a must to pick up their original Russian release...
B000000W5H|5.0|After &quot;Let it Bleed,&quot; this is my favorite Stones album. This is such a &quot;musical&quot; album, and the music is just awesome. &quot;If You Can't Rock Me&quot; still blows me away to this day, and &quot;Til the Next Goodbye&quot; and &quot;Time Waits for No One&quot; are simply some of the best songs the Stones ever recorded.<br />Great guitar work from Mick Taylor, and just some great songwriting. This is such an overlooked Stones album, it's sickening. I'd listen to this one WAY before &quot;Exile on Main Street,&quot; which is completely overrated, sorry to say.
0446677450|4.0|The book &quot;Rich Dad, Poor Dad&quot; portrays the idea of how to become rich.  In reading this book, my feelings were mixed.  Some of the ideas I completely agreed with, and others, I felt like not everyone lives in a perfect world.  I also think that the authors could have made the book shorter and more to the point.  Some of the ideas were drawn out too much, and it lost the important factor that it is just an advise.  I would give this book a 4 because I think some people need to be informed on how others believe how to become rich, and others need some general advise.
B00001R3GI|3.0|This would be a good album if half of it wasn't included. Songs like \\"Rocks Off,\\" \\"Loving Cup\\" and \\"Rip This Joint\\" are essential Stones songs, but this includes a lot of fluff like \\"Shake Your Hips,\\" \\"Casino Boogie,\\" \\"Turd on the Run\\" and especially \\"I Just Want to See His Face.\\" <br />Even Mick Jagger stated in a Rolling Stone magazine interview in 1994 that this is an overrated album. \\"Beggar's Banquet,\\" \\"Sticky Fingers,\\" and especially \\"Let it Bleed\\" are better albums and deserve the title as the Stones's greatest albums.
B0000009TT|4.0|Zappa the composer! Zappa the improviser! Zappa the humorist! Zappa the experimentalist! Zappa the guitarist! Zappa the provoker! Zappa the bandleader! Zappa the inventor! Zappa the ironic! Zappa the arena rocker! Zappa the conseptualist! Zappa the parodic! Zappa the romatic!<BR>More than any of his albums, \\"Lather\\" reveals every aspect of Zappa's genius. The record company's veto of releasing it as it was back in 1977, and it's fate as a series of conceptually much less interesting \\"genre albums\\", is one of rock history's true tragedies. After such an illtreat, most artists would have given up even the thought of making more music.<BR>But not Zappa. The reason, I think, is that Zappa didn't just make music. He WAS music. Like Picasso, Fassbinder and Miles Davis, Zappa is one of the very few artists who's art is impossible to separate from the man and vice versa. Nothing in this world could ever stop this man from making music. If he had been blown out to outer space or separated from the world on a desolated island, he would still have been making music. Should you have any doubt about that, listen to the \\"Lather\\" album.  It's creative waterfall of inventiveness, ecclectism and stunning performances stands unsurpassed in the history of rock music.<BR>You then may wonder why I don't rate \\"Lather\\" a five star album. Maybe I should, but in my opinion (don't shoot me!) Zappa never made a five star album. For that, his music is simply too diverse. I don't even think he ever sat out to make a masterpiece as such, his music is just one continuous, unstoppable flow of creativity. And even how much I will recommend this fabulous recording, I can't think there is anyone, no matter how ecclecting and accepting in musical taste, who can possibly like everything here. <BR>Still, this momentous masterpiece belongs in every representative rock album collection.
B00005JKZT|5.0|Yes! I have finally seen it and oh my!! It's just what I hoped for and even better than I expected! It's not as \\"flashy\\" (in lack of a better word) as fellowship. It's not so much \\"right in your face cool\\", but it's more serious. More adult. And that's a good thing. I loved fellowship, gave it 5 stars, and this one is definetly just as good. It's actually hard to say that towers is better than fellowship because it's just a continuing story. We got thrown in to the story like we never left our seats after fellowship. And it's just as long as fellowship! Gollum is wonderful, Treebeard is wonderful, and the battle of Helm's Deep is...well...you know... Arwen and Galadriel have just little cameos. That's a good thing too because I was worried about how much they would change the story just to let those to actresses have bigger parts. We don't see Merry and Pippin much, but Gimli is the comic break this time around. And oh my is he funny!! Call me stupid, you shouldn't laugh when the battle of Helm's Deep is going on, but Gimli made me! See this little movie! NOW!
B000075BFK|5.0|Great CD, not catchy songs but great lyrics! 2pac's ability to tell stories through his songs is unique! He proves that with &quot;My block remix&quot; on disc two. It makes you realize how great he were, and how sad it is that he's gone!
B00006RG7F|1.0|It's too bad Diana betrayed the music she was promising so many times to be devoted too ( OK, she bent it ). Miles Davis wanted to be as famous as  Michael Jackson, I wonder what a role model is for Diana. After 3 consecutive albums with same catchy material maybe it's time to go back to jazz...<BR>We'll be patient, since you're are a musical genius and a Canadian too.
B00006JJ1O|4.0|The TATu cd is a breath of fresh air to the music scenes. The brilliant mix of rock, techno, european dance, beautiful vocals, and searing guitars is something you will soon find yourself falling into. If that is not enough, the girls are beautiful, free willed, Russians who give the album an additional kick in the pants. In addition to the cd, you also receive the video to all the things she said as well as pieces of them; not to be missed. The tunes are catchy as well. You may find yourself humming them throughout the day. Check out something new and the next direction of music. Check this cd out.
B0000787FH|5.0|There is always something so special about an artist who changes their direction entirely and does an album of more inward work.  Sure, it may anger some casual fans and critics, but it will really touch and amaze those who really care.  Such is the case with Elvis Costello's &quot;Imperial Bedroom.&quot;<br />Start to finish, this is EC's best album. And, like Dylan's &quot;Blood on the Tracks&quot; before it, or Springsteen's &quot;Tunnel of Love&quot; after it, it is a more intimate piece focusing on different aspects of basic human emotions.<br />Though it contains no real &quot;greatest hits,&quot; this album shows EC's songwriting at its best.  Songs like &quot;Beyond Belief,&quot; &quot;Man Out of Time,&quot; &quot;The Loved Ones,&quot; and &quot;Pidgeon English&quot; are all songs that are clearly the works of a lyrical and musical genius.<br />To make matters even better, all the songs are dressed up in a sort of Sgt. Pepper-esque production, adding an extra layer to the masterpiece.<br />All in all, it's a tremendous work from an amazingly talented singer/songwriter.
B00004XOWM|1.0|This album is nothing but the same old rehashed junk from signifucant other. This is NOT metal in any shape or form. Bizkit only appeals to 12=15 yr old boys or girls who don't really know what rock music is. If you want some good metal/rock go for Spineshank, Tool, Godsmack, Simon Says, Disturbed, or anything but Bizkit. Bizkit is junk, feel like wasting your money on an awful band then Bizkit has the albums for you...OOOO and they have a remix one too...
B00006JJ1O|5.0|Adding &quot;200km/h in the wrong lane&quot; to my CD-collection is probably the best thing I've done for a long time. The CD has a good mix of slow relaxing songs and up-tempo songs including both songs in English and Russian. By having the two girls singin at the same time it lifts the song to a higher level. Together they make the songs even more powerful. The lyrics isn't always clear but, probably, that's the good thing about those, a bit, mysterious girls from Russia. It's also great that Russia, as a country, shows that also they produce modern and good music. Enjoy!
B00005JL2O|2.0|The first two were great (they still make me giggle today), but Goldmember has seriously little to offer. The Foxy Cleopatra character makes previous female foils seem downright literary in their complexity. The Goldmember character is incomprehensibly stupid and underexplained. The Fat Bastard poop-jokes are tired. And on and on. Is this to say there are absolutely no laughs to be had? Of course not, but not enough to reward staring at the thing for almost two hours.
B00006AG5N|5.0|Did we really need another compilation of Elvis Presley's greatest, or in this case, number one, hits?  Releases that aim to provide a survey of this giant of rock `n' roll have been innumerable, but often useless and badly prepared, already in the old days of vinyl. Yet, somehow BMG/RCA grandly surpassed itself 25 years after the untimely death of one of the biggest and apparently inexhaustible numbers in their catalogue, by releasing this ELV1S 30 #1 Hits - and the massive commercial successes all around the globe prove they made it right: the sound quality of this disc is stunning and puts most, if not all, previous efforts to shame, the liner notes are relevant, the artwork is superb, the selection of songs makes perfect sense, and even the marketing campaign was a model. Starting with the novel sound of \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\" from 1956 up to the JXL remix of \\"A Little Less Conversation\\", the surprise smash hit of last summer, ELV1S 30 #1 Hits is not only an appetizing sample of Elvis' musical range and cultural impact, it is nearly 80 minutes of music history.<br />It would be way too naïve to call ELV1S 30 #1 Hits the `nec plus ultra' collection of Elvis Presley's music, yet it will be difficult to surpass it. The ideal introduction for those who still need to discover what the man was and is all about, as well as, finally, the correct tribute to one of the true monuments in the history of popular music.
B00005JKZT|5.0|I attended a midnight showing of the Two Towers last night and found that it was worth the night without sleep.<br />This movie doesn't need a lot of description.  Quality is consistant from the last picture, which is to be expected since they were all made at once.  The Graphics were very good.  The special effects awsome (love those ents)  The sound quality in the theater was poor, (of course it could just be that I was tired) but I'll see it again with the kids and judge it properly then.<br />Golumn does his best to steal the show.  The Character is great and is acted well.  I say Acted because Andy Serkis voice and movements that the graphics were put over were vital to the character.  I tended to feel more and more sorry for the character, particularly since Frodo was moving in the same direction.  Great Job by wood.<br />I think the decision to make Gimli a comic character hurt and I would have liked to see more of the interplay between him and Legolas. (perhaps in the extended version) It was the films only weakness.<br />Easily the best movie of the year.  It is almost high art.  The Godfather is high art, Star Wars is not, however this movie moves toward that direction.  The final movie will confirm it.<br />The story is rife with symbols of the modern earth shaking events taking place now.  Those who believe in coincidence and who follow current events must be amazed.  I don't belive in coincidence so I am not.  From the rising of the Ents to the turning of Théoden, (war is upon you if you like it or not)the parallels are astounding.  Many will miss it, some will do their best to ignore it but the message of these two (soon to be three) movies at this time, speaks to an age the message it needs to hear.  The makers and the actors deny this, but they are ring bearers like it or no.
B00007BHOE|5.0|This is a dvd that is worth adding to your collection no questions asked!To the dude from goose creek this is just as good as the live concert,Especially for the ones who have not seen them u try hard.Go and buy this dvd now u wont be disapointed.
B00000AOUD|5.0|This is a classic of 70's Rock. As a college student I can remember reading over the cover notes chuckling over the ironies of the sardonic humor.<br />Seeing the TaaB tour in Hershey in 1973-4 the show was as wild as the album, the non-Rabbit, scuba divers, etc  all coming onstage throughout the songand Anderson seemingly playing on one foot the whole time. After almost 90 minutes and what we knew was the end of the concert the song came to and end. A whole concert, one song, unbelievable but why not live cuts in that era were always longer, often twice as long as the lp and TaaB was 40+ minutes on the LP. After a long pause, Ian Anderson then stepped forward and said, &quot;And now for our second song of the evening and Tull went into &quot;Locomotive Breath&quot; as the Areana erupted.<br />This album is one of the greats by one of the giants of the height of the psychedellic era of the 70's. It is filled with twisting moments of wry wit and the ponderous basslines of the era. It will test the limits of any sound system around automotive or home but is far more interesting in its fugue style than the thump, thump, thump of modern bottom end.
B000059TPN|5.0|This is a great movie. No Academy Awards, no Golden Globes, nothing. This movie has it all. A great score from Gregson-Williams, another great movie Jerry Bruckheimer and Don Simpson. then, you have Sean Connery. COme on, if he is in the movie, it's going to be good. He was awesome. Nicholas CAge was good in this movie, too. <BR>  I must say, if you like a good story, some good movie music, and good acting and directing, then, this movie is a must for anybody. Oh, it being an action movie dosn't hurt, either.
B00005FGP7|5.0|Achtung baby is a great record. No, it's a brilliant record. No, it's a rocking emotional record. No, it's art. No, it's is all that and so much more. It is U2 in a moment unlike themselves and anyone else. It is a tremendous record. If I could suggest to you an album that everyone should own. This (along with the Joshua Tree) would be one of them. I do not know how you can not hear the emotional bells ringing when you listen to this album. I say it. Own this album. Listen to it carefully. It is a treasure that should not be missed out on. <BR>I cannot even begin to express how many times this album has been there for me. To sing along to &quot;who's gonna ride your wild horses&quot; or &quot;trying to throw your arms around the girl&quot; or just play my guitar trying to be the Edge on &quot;the fly&quot; or &quot;ultraviolet (light my way)&quot; <BR>lyrically = amazing and so forth and beyond<BR>musically = same as the lyrics <br />a must have
B00005RFAI|5.0|When I first heard the singles from Pink's first album, I thought she was just another R&amp;B/Bubblegum/Pop princess -- like Britney or Christina or Jessica. But when I heard &quot;Just Like a Pill&quot; I heard something fresh and interesting, so I bought MissUndaztood. I can't stop listening to this CD! The songs are fresh, real, soulful, and original. Her voice is incredible - the most interesting voice I've heard in a long time. And for those who think she's deserted her R&amp;B routes that got her started - they need to listen to the original R&amp;B like Aretha and Marvin Gaye. Pink is a lot truer to the music than the R&amp;B/Pop being recorded today. If you are even the slightest bit interested in buying this CD, especially if you weren't impressed with the first one, buy this CD!! I'm anxiously awaiting the next one!
B000001EAQ|5.0|yes this is a great album. a marvelous album. U2 at another glimmering moment probably due to the aid of a disco ball but who cares?  This album is so textured rich and yet misuderstood that it is amazing. So many people down play it but it is one of their best records. It's not War or the Joshua Tree or even Achtung Baby, but it's not supposed to be. Pop is a great album for many reasons. It's rock, dance, anthem, intimate, and pop wrapped in a 12 song set that is just completely deserving of a worthy audience. with songs like &quot;gone&quot; and &quot;if she wears that velvet dress&quot; being some of the bands finest work, there is no reason you should not like this record unless you have bad taste. <BR>thank you
B00006JJ1O|3.0|The young duo of Tatu have really outdone themselves.  After months of push-backs, their first full-length? American release, \\"200 Km/H in the Wrong Lane\\" comes off sounding tightly produced and expertly polished &lt;Thanks to executive-producer Ivan Shapovalov>.<br />Granted, I had a lot of second thoughts about the group when I first heard that ½ of the album was going to be in English, but they didn't let me down as hard as I had predicted.<br />You see, Tatu (or Taty or t.a.T.u. depending on where you live) consists of two beautiful young girls singing about love while being backed by a giant media machine that writes and produces their songs for them.  Here in the states, that's what we like to call \\"bubblegum pop\\" ala Britany Spears<br />That was strike #1.<br />Strike two was the odd fact that half of the album was in English and as we all know, Russian is /not/ English.  Translating one language into another is always a shot in the dark; making it cogent while fitting it to the same beat as the native song just stacks punishment on top of insult.<br />To get a visual of what I'm talking about, watch the video for \\"All the Things She Said\\" then watch the original one \\"Ya Soshla S Uma (I've Lost My Mind).\\"  They used the same footage, but they chopped and edited it in an attempt to fit the lip sync of the new words.  &lt;shrug><br />Maybe I'm just odd, but I prefer /not/ knowing exactly what the girls were singing about.  Without lyrical comprehension, I could appreciate Lena & Julia's voices as just another instrument in the band.
0596000480|3.0|The word \\"guide\\" suggests a book that will help you learn something from the beginning. This book won't.    \\"JavaScript - The Definitive Guide\\" is a very thorough and up-to-date compendium of the JavaScript programming language, so it's definitely an excellent reference book. However, unless you're already very familiar with other languages that have similar syntax and structure (C, C++, Java and perhaps PHP), don't expect to learn how to write JavaScript programs with this book.    The author has no qualms about using complicated language to supposedly \\"explain\\" simple concepts. You don't have to take my word for it; here's an excerpt, from page 110:    \\"The Arguments object has one very unusual feature. When a function has named arguments, the array elements of the Arguments object are synonyms for the local variables that hold the function arguments. The arguments[] array and the argument named arguments are two different ways of referring to the same variable. Changing the value of an argument with an argument name changes the value that is retrieved through the arguments[] array. Changing the value of an argument through the arguments[] array changes the value that is retrieved by the argument name.\\"    Okay, so after reading the above paragraph two or three times you finally get it. But just imagine reading 424 pages (I'm discounting the reference part of the book) of equally dense text, with examples that are sometimes clear as mud.    Bottomline: Need a good JavaScript reference book? Look no further. Want to start learning how to write scripts for the web? You'd probably be better off with a book from the \\"Teach yourself\\" series (published by Sams).
B00000IL1K|5.0|This is an album that can truly be enjoyed without skipping over any of its songs.  Each and every song is great.  A very relaxing album.
B00004SWBD|4.0|Personaly I loved the album and hope to see many more like it. It wasn't as fast as some of their new stuff (IOWA), But I think the songs had alot more meaning and thought put into them.<br />Defiantly a good album to have in the CD collection.
B00006JJ1O|4.0|In my opinion the new English album was done very well.  Some of the songs had slight altercations in order to improve the overall flow of the songs which made it a little nicer.  Most of the lyrics were very different from that of Russian which I do not like but if you have never heard the Russian tracks or do not speak it I am sure the album would be loved by anyone who likes electronica music.
B00006CXSS|5.0|What can I say? It's Band of Brothers! I bought this for my hubby for Xmas and he loves it! It's an amazing series and the DVD has some great extras, like interviews and doucmentaries. A great buy!
B00006JJ1O|5.0|Produced by the master Trevor Horn (Seal, FGTH, Propaganda a.o.), this album is one of the most important productions of the year! Sometimes sharp as a razor blade, sometimes soft as a kiss by a hot summer wind, the album takes you on a trip in a strange, yet enchanting universe. The two russian girls tell their stories with enthusiasm, energy and strong sexual undertones. They have voices and looks like angels, but inside something darker and more dangerous and unpredictable is lurking! Powerful, intensive dance tracks mixed with beautiful and depressing ballads - the album has it all! I want to hear it again - and again....The more I listen the more I fall in love with t.A:T.u's universe! Thank you......
0440180295|3.0|I must say the book does not work for me. It is funny in spots, and the prose has a Hemingwayesque terseness and sparsity, and so on. Or so it goes. <br />I don't understand the sci-fi part, or how it relates to the anti-war theme. Bill Pilgrim had the time-travel talent _before_ he witnessed the Dresden inferno; so it could not have been a post-combat stress syndrome. (Or maybe he acquired afterwards, which in turn allowed him to travel back in time. I wasn't clear, but give that possibility. Even that being the case, I don't feel it is as directly a protest on organized violence, as what are shown in Catch 22). Because of this incomprehension, my reading was jarred by the distraction, and that might have prevented me from appreciating the book more. <br />Also the alien part, read in its own right, is mediocre, neither funny nor relevant nor conducive to fantasy.
6304479689|5.0|This is a rare Elvis Presley movie with outtakes (in the end credits). And there are some Elvis Presley movies with no end credits like Jailhouse Rock and Love Me Tender. This movie is Elvis Presley's last movie (if you count this and Elvis That's the Way It Is). Unlike Elvis That's the Way It Is, Elvis Presley is in concert in the begining or about to take the stage. But there are still questions that I would like to know. Why does Elvis get a guitar in the beginning of this movie and one other time in this movie, but not play in less he is going to go into a guitar break? How can singers/actors stand have light in thier faces if the house lights are not up? And even they have the light in thier faces during the of thier performance.
0800196341|3.0|this film shows the difference between movies and the stage. film has always been more about the image than the word. theater, on the other hand, is just the opposite being more about the word than the image. this film is all about the image. yes, all the words are there, but they are mouthed so quickly that it's all but impossible to hear the bard through all the verbiage. indeed, the words are so peripheral to this production that you could turn off the sound and just watch the images and not lose much, if any, of the story. the only exception is derek jacobi who gives a great performance as claudius. <br />so, when people say the significance of this film is that it's the only one to include all of shakespeare's words, what they really mean is that it's the only film to include all of shakespeare's scenes. yes, all the words are there. too bad shakespeare's poetry is all but lost in their hasty effusion.<br />branagh does make some interesting interpretational choices. for example, he shows hamlet and ophelia as already having consummated their love. there are hints in the text of this but it can be interpreted either way. he also turns the famous \\"to be or not to be\\" soliloquy into a kind of meditation on murder, as hamlet is clearly speaking not so much to himself as to the king who he suspects is hiding behind the mirror. i'm not convinced this really works, but it is daring, nevertheless. the decision to site the play in a sparkling 19th century estate rather than the original 16th century castle has been much critisized, but i think it suits branagh's hamlet who is not so much an introverted, melancholy prince as he is an extroverted, playful, and witty good fellow who 'cursed spite' has burdened with a big chip on his little shoulders.<br />and this leads to another criticism of branagh's hamlet.  he's such an energetic and outgoing fellow that it's hard to understand why he doesn't kill the king right away.  branagh's hamlet just doesn't have the depth toexplain the delay.  compare his preformance with derek jacobi's in the bbc production which is far more nuanced.  jacobi's interpretation makes far more sense.<br />all in all, a very good visual experience. but read the play to fully appreciate shakespeare's genius. hamlet really is one of the great works of literature.
B00006JJ1O|4.0|I'll admit it, I first got into t.A.T.u because they were \\"hot lesbians\\".  The more I listened, the more I liked them, and the more the \\"hot lesbian\\" gimmich became a moot point.  When I heard there was going to be an English album, I knew I was going to get it.  Now that it's here, I must say I am impressed.  While the CD is rather short (there are 11 songs, but some are repeats in English and Russian), There are quite a few gems on there.  It's hard to review this CD because while I do enjoy listening to it, I just wish there was more.  Is it worth owning?  Yeah, but don't pay more than $10 for it.
B00004U8H4|1.0|I tried, I really did. I expected to enjoy this movie, even just a little. In the end, I watched most of this in fast-forward, hoping that something just a few minutes later into the movie would redeem it. Heck, not even the soundtrack helped, and I love 80s pop. Don't bother hitting \\"pause\\" when you go to the bathroom - you won't miss anything. The was-it-real-or-imagined aspect was rather neat, but the characters were just too weak. It's hard to make a movie work when none of the characters has any more depth than a shedded snakeskin and you just can't care if they live or die. Yea, I know the characters are supposed to be shallow (they are, after all, 80s stockbrokers - Hollywood's ultimate soulless weasel stereotype), but they lack even that much depth. They're wet-paper thin. It's almost possible to generate some sympathy for the prostitute or the secretary - almost. In the end the apathy wins and it doesn't even matter that it's only a movie. Who cares?
B000002WNP|5.0|Elvis' 1960's work, especially his movie soundtracks which are not on here, gets mostly unfairly overlooked and dismissed. Sure, after coming home from the army in 1960, his style changed to a more pop sound with an occassional dip into the blues, (most of disc 1) and was and still is criticized for not continuing his 50s mastery of rock n roll. However, while Elvis was on his two year hitch, music changed. The rockers like Jerry Lee Lewis, Little Richard and Chuck Berry gave way to Frankie Avalon, Bobby Rydell, Bobby Darin, Fabian and in all a more pop sounding version of rock n roll. So when Elvis started cutting records in 1960 his sound changed also. Sure, &quot;Stuck On You&quot; was a leftover sound of the late 50s, but new sounds like &quot;It's Now Or Never&quot;, &quot;Make Me Know It&quot; and others made the transition for Elvis and he was never more popular. His first four single releases went to #1 in the US with many more following through 1962. This box, which runs in chronological order, gives you every studio master that Elvis cut (minus gospel and movie tunes). Disc one is an absolute masterpiece which covers his first studio album of the 1960s, &quot;Elvis Is Back&quot; as well as other classic tracks from early 1961 such as &quot;I Feel So Bad&quot;, &quot;Give Me The Right&quot;, and a personal favorite &quot;I'm Coming Home&quot;. Disc 2 bridges his '61 work with 1962 and part of 1963 and features excellent tunes such as &quot;His Latest Flame&quot;, &quot;Little Sister&quot;, &quot;Kiss Me Quick&quot;, &quot;She's Not You&quot; and another personal favorite &quot;Witchcraft&quot;. If there was to be a &quot;weak disc&quot; in the set, it would be disc 3. It's not really weak, (it's rather good) but not nearly as good as the others. It features great tunes such as &quot;It Hurts Me&quot;, &quot;Memphis&quot;, &quot;Down In The Alley&quot;, &quot;Ask Me&quot;, &quot;US Male&quot; plus more. These were recorded between 1964 and 1967 which was probably the lowest point of Elvis' career. Disc 4 contains the legendary 1969 material which cemented Elvis' comeback. While Elvis' hitmaking was as prolific as it was 9 years before, he still enjoyed a handful of top ten hits and his first #1 with &quot;Suspicious Minds&quot; since 1962's &quot;Good Luck Charm&quot;. Highlights on disc 4 are &quot;Suspicious Minds&quot;, &quot;In The Ghetto&quot;, &quot;Don't Cry Daddy&quot;, &quot;Rubberneckin'&quot; and another personal favorite &quot;Power Of My Love&quot;. Disc 5 is a mixed bag of goodies which features the last of the 60s masters, several alternate takes and the awesome live duet performance of &quot;Love Me Tender&quot;/&quot;Witchcraft&quot; with Frank Sinatra. Wrapped up in an attractive box and an excellent booklet filled with pictures, stories and session notes, this set if the perfect set for the Elvis completist to go along with the excellent 50s and the 70s boxes.
0792842723|5.0|Not only does this film reintroduce James Bond 007 to a new generation, but it provides viewers with a fresh taste to the Bond formula while still keeping all of the requirements safely in tact. In this film, 007 is up against a renegade 006 who plans to wipe out London and take all of the money. Pierce Brosnan is so perfect in the part of Bond, it's hard imagining anyone else playing him as well... that is, if you haven't seen the Connery movies. &quot;Goldeneye&quot; keeps the viewer on their toes and exhilerated through its two-hour runtime. It is a very exciting, action-packed thrill ride.
B000002WUD|5.0|By time 1970 rolled around, Elvis had been a megastar for about 14 years. He didn't have nearly the amounts of hit records that he had more than a decade ago but his concentration was focused on entertaining. During the 1970s, Elvis performed more than 1,000 live shows up until his death in 1977 and during those shows he would of course do the old hits like \\"Hound Dog\\" and so on but he always saved his best performances for newer songs. <br />The first 2 discs of this set feature all of Elvis' single releases in the 1970s which are probably the highest point of the sets. As well as hit tunes like \\"The Wonder Of You\\", \\"Burning Love\\", \\"Promised Land\\", Presley sang his heart out on songs such as \\"I've Lost You\\", \\"The Next Step Is Love\\", \\"Always On My Mind\\" and covers like \\"Hurt\\" and \\"Pledging My Love\\" which he stamped as his own. Disc 3 is a little weaker than the first two as it contains the better of Elvis' album cuts as well as some nice alternate and informal recordings. Disc 4 is pretty much the same featuring a master recording of \\"My Way\\", which some think his live performances are superior to Sinatra's version, as well as the fan favorites \\"Susan When She Tried\\", \\"Are You Sincere\\", my personal favorite \\"I've Got A Feeling In My Body\\" and a single Christmas masterpiece \\"Merry Christmas Baby\\". The majority of disc 5 is live performances which rank among his best (especially \\"Something\\" and \\"It's Over\\"). The final disc closes out with a few rehearsal and informal recordings of some noteworthy tunes but disc 5's brilliance belongs to the live performances. <br />Sure, the 1970's Elvis can't match his 1960's material and doesn't really come close to his 1950's material but it does show Elvis and his voice fully matured and fully capable to belt out any song he wanted and make it his own. <br />A definite must have along with the 50's and 60's masters.
6303855474|3.0|Sylvester Stallone really knows how to be campy. All throughout \\"Judge Dredd,\\" he never seems to take the part seriously and it's all for the better. The film wouldn't work if Stallone had tried to be convincing. Instead, he stands macho and strong, overacting and chewing scenery while still keeping his dignity. Way to go, Stallone! The plot takes place in the future, where Judges are now city police and crime, of course, does not pay. The best of the judges, Dredd, has just been framed for murder and now a former judge threatens to take over the world unless Dredd can stop him. It's a very basic premise, stealing from the likes of \\"Robocop\\" and others, but it works surprisingly well. The special effects are mostly pretty good if not dated by today's standards. Overall, the film packs in punch and fun and delivers a solid 90 minutes.
B000002WMH|5.0|Elvis' monumental records of the 1950s are second to no one. The King earned his crown in the 50's and this set proves why. This set starts off with the 1953 acetate &quot;My Happiness&quot; which is the first time Elvis' voice was recorded on a record. After that piece of history, the first disc moves on to his most important recordings of all time and probably the most important recordings by any rock n roller, his Sun Sessions. Kicking off with &quot;That's All Right&quot;, Presley began his smashing of music barriers and the soaring if his unmatched popularity. Other great Sun tunes (all of them are great, really) are &quot;Good Rockin' Tonight&quot;, &quot;Baby Let's Play House&quot; and the final Sun tune, &quot;Mystery Train&quot;. By time Elvis' recording deal was sold to RCA in November of 1955, the latter was climbing the national country charts and Elvis was a huge star in the southeastern portion of the US. The first disc wraps up with Elvis' first RCA sessions which produced classics such as &quot;My Baby Left Me&quot;, &quot;I Was The One&quot;, &quot;Blue Suede Shoes&quot; and his first #1 national hit &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot;. The 2nd disc opens up with the phoenominal Lloyd Price cover of &quot;Lawdy Miss Clawdy&quot; which Elvis makes his own and continues through his 1956 material which includes covers such as &quot;Shake Rattle and Roll&quot;, &quot;Long Tall Sally&quot;, &quot;Ready Teddy&quot; and &quot;Rip It Up&quot;, ballads &quot;Love Me Tender&quot;, &quot;Love Me&quot;, &quot;Anyway You Want Me&quot; and biggest double sided 45 single ever &quot;Don't Be Cruel&quot; and &quot;Hound Dog&quot; as well as many other treats. The 2nd disc closes and the 3rd disc begins with his 1957 material which nearly equals his '56 output in quality. All the big '57 hits are on here such as &quot;All Shook Up&quot;, &quot;Teddy Bear&quot;, &quot;Loving You&quot; and &quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot; as well as a handful of gospel songs, eight of his best Christmas tunes and the original &quot;One Night&quot; version which is titled &quot;One Night Of Sin&quot;. I never cared much for the music from his fourth movie, King Creole so Im not going to go out of my way to praise to first part of disc 4, but the second half showcases Elvis' final tunes before his army hitch. Such songs as &quot;A Fool Such As I&quot;, &quot;I Need Your Love Tonight&quot;, &quot;A Big Hunk O Love&quot; and others rank up there with some of the most important songs he ever sang as well as arguable the last great true rock n roll songs of the 50's. Disc 4 closes with a nice 15 minute or so interview with Elvis before his departure overseas. Disc 5 is a mixed bag of treats which features mostly previously unreleased alternate takes of his 50's recordings or previously unreleased live performances as well as another acetate &quot;That's When Your Heartaches Begin&quot; which was recorded about six months after &quot;My Happiness&quot; and about 6 months before &quot;That's All Right&quot;. Elvis later went on to record &quot;Thats When Your Heartaches Begin&quot; in 1957 and was the B side of his smash hit &quot;All Shook Up&quot;. <br />Like the 60's and 70's set, this also features a wonderful booklet with pictures, stories, and session notes.<br />Most of these recordings, alone, are classics by themselves. When they are put together in an box set, you have the ultimate of ultimate, the complete recordings of arguably the most famous rock n roll performer and singer of all time from a decade in time where he could do little to no wrong.
B00005JG6R|4.0|This is the film that really jump-started the anime craze. Without it, America wouldn't be as overwhelmed with all of these Japanese imports from the obvious like Dragonball Z to the atypical like &quot;Grave of the Fireflies.&quot; &quot;Akira&quot; never really bothers to flesh out its story. Instead, it works as a way to stir things up in the mind a bit. It's ultraviolent and savage at times, but very captivating. One of the qualities is that it always feels fresh and original. But it's one of those films that needs to be seen more than once to be fully understood. The animation is very slick and great to look at and the music has a futuristic tone to it. Overall, &quot;Akira&quot; makes for a great film for even the most casual of anime fans such as myself.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|I personally love this cd! It's great! If you like techno, with a mix of pop and a little rap(though it's russian rap) you will definetly love this cd. To find out more about tATu, visit tatugirls.com or taty.us. If you like tATu, I recommend that you listen to other great artists like Christina Aguilera or No Doubt. tATu defines major pop controversy with their suggestive lyrics of girl on girl love and have given new meaning to the catholic school girl uniform (move over Brintey!) Go buy this album NOW!!!

0060977493|5.0|This is the story about a pair of unidentical twins, love, relationships, politics, religion and the Indian class society. The book is not chronological and you get fragments of the story in complete disorder. Then you realise that everything was in a special order, that it had to be in that particular order to make the book so good. The story is seen from different generations, but most of the time you see it through the twins' eyes. You meet the twins Rahel and Esthappen, their mother Ammu, Ammu's mother the half-blind Mammachi and her father Papachi. There is also the old aunt Baby Kochamma, Ammu's brother the old Marxist Chacko, his English daughter (the twins' cousin) Sophie Mol and the \\"untouchable\\", low-cast carpenter Velutha.<BR> It all begins when Rahel is grown up and returns to Ayemenem (her childhood-home) in the south of India. At the beginning I didn't understand the plot and for a while I wondered what it really was about, if there was going to happen something to connect everything and everyone. At first I didn't get any answer. But the more I read, the more I wanted to read. And then the plot opens like a flower, at first there's nothing,<BR>but after you've read a bit you see it a little clearer, and then even more clear and so on. It isn't until in the end, the last pages, you understand everything.<BR> Roy uses the language in a beautiful way, with perfect words and descriptions of everything. You really get pictures of everything. She also plays on words, splits words and makes new ones of them and uses a lot of Indian words, which makes it very funny. It's also fun to read what the twins think and say to each other. How they feel like one person and understand each other without saying a word.<BR> I really liked the book and hope many others will enjoy it.
0679746048|5.0|I viewed the movie before I had read the book, and I have to say that I like the the book better. The book obviously described Susanna's descent into &quot;madness&quot; and also let me know what happened to her after she was discharged. The movie kind of left me hanging as to waht happened to her. I really enjoyed the book more than I liked the movie... highly recommended!
B00005J6SZ|5.0|Madonna really scored a classic album back in 1984 with this Nile Rodgers-produced sophomore effort. While many dismiss its lackluster and unfulfilling, it is overstuffed with great moments, despite being less than 10 tracks. The first single and title track (and now classic) Like a Virgin is still as excellent and controversial sounding as ever. Material Girl and Dress You Up also haven't lost any edge; they'll get you up on that dancefloor alright. Also contains great moments such as Love Don't Live Here Anymore and Stay, as well as Over and Over which was remixed for the YOU CAN DANCE album and Angel, the dreamy hit released alongside Into the Groove way back when. All in all, Like a Virgin is still quite a catchy album, and now, backed with two 12\\" mixes, you either have the album already or you don't have an excuse to not.
0811826848|5.0|I just finished reading this book, and was very pleased with it.  Yes, the book is a bit heavy, and a lot of the information isn't new, but it was nice to hear the Beatles tell it in their own words.  Also, the Beatles and friends opened up their private collections for this book, resulting in a load of never before seen pictures being included here.  If you want the Beatles story straight from the source, buy this book!
B000066NW0|5.0|This album is excellent and I am tired of all these reviews that say that it isn't, when in fact all the people are reviewing is Avril's choice of clothing and, in some instances, her personality. I had purchased the debut albums from Michelle Branch and Vanessa Carlton this past August (I associate the three of them, not on talent, simply because they're 3 young female singer/songwriters who've recently released debuts), and at first my excuse for not purchasing LET GO was because I thought Lavigne seemed liked a 1-hit wonder; that's the kind of vibe I felt from COMPLICATED back when it was the only Avril song I knew. Well, I bought this CD 11/01/02 after a sudden change of heart (no, not really swayed by Sk8er Boi, the latest single), and not only do I think that Avril's going to be making albums her entire life, but I think she's *better* than Michelle Branch and Vanessa Carlton. Where Michelle and Vanessa's albums are good, Avril seems to've taken another step and made her album more varied, lyrically and musically, and that is the key to a good album.<br />LOSING GRIP & UNWANTED are the real rockers here. They will appeal to both pop and heavy metal fans. The lyrics are excellent and her emotion permeates the tracks.<br />NAKED, MY WORLD, ANYTHING BUT ORDINARY, TOMORROW, and MOBILE are great tracks that find Avril revealing herself for the first time, reminiscing about her life in Napanee, firmly taking personal stances, and articulating how disorienting life can be.<br />TOO MUCH TO ASK FOR and NOBODY'S FOOL are the only filler here. The lyrics aren't that good, her voice has no real emotion as on the other tracks, and her light rapping on NOBODY'S FOOL might make you think her purpose was to make you laugh. 2 definite skippers out of thirteen.<br />COMPLICATED, SK8ER BOI, and I'M WITH YOU are all hit singles you've probably heard if you're here, so you don't need anyone to judge these three-just note that they don't come close to representing the other songs on the album.<br />THINGS I'LL NEVER SAY is easily the best song here, filled with lyrics many of us can relate to and an absolutely *addictive!* hook.<br />Throughout this guitar-ladden, at times heavily-produced album unravels the real person Avril Lavigne is; not the Avril you might think you know, but an Avril like you and me. There's just this one thing different about her: She took her emotions that needed to get out of her system and with them created this stunning album. You will not let go of this CD once you start listening. Judge Avril as you wish, but rest assured that this is really an unbelievable debut album from an artist who WILL be around for a long time, and for good reason.on the album.<br />THINGS I'LL NEVER SAY is easily the best song here, filled with lyrics many of us can relate to and an absolutely *addictive!* hook. <br />Throughout this guitar-ladden, at times heavily-produced album unravels the real person Avril Lavigne is; not the Avril you might think you know, but an Avril like you and me.

0066214122|3.0|A nice travel book, nothing more, nothing less.<BR>Having read all of Michael Chrichton's novels, I can say with high degree of certainty that he has become very predictable. <BR>At times I wasn't sure whether I was reading Prey or Jursassic Park (or the Nano scale version of it).<BR>Be that as it may, one simply cannot ignore Crichton's remarkable ability to introduce very complex subjects to the layperson without taking out the fun of reading.
B00005Y6RY|5.0|It was 1980, Gabriel was going solo for the past 3 years at this point. The previous album \\"Peter Gabriel 2: Scratch\\", laid the foundation for this one except that one did suffer from the cloudy production from Robert Fripp yet benefited from it's raw beauty in the songs. The morbid yet blue/jazz influenced \\"Home Sweet Home\\" marked what was to come at the ending of the 2nd album. Even the morbidity of that song was nothing compared to the frightening darkness and the alienated, black & white mood of Peter Gabriel 3 a.k.a Melting Face. The melting photograph perfectly shows the mood of the record: DARK & TERRORIZING!<br />Intruder could as well get my nod as the most frightening song ever recorded to tape. The song begins with echoing Phil Collins-style drums and the sound of wires being pulled and ripped out of a wall and then distorted chords come and shrieking voice effects come in with lyrics that tell the story of a burglar breaking into someone's home. Few songs scared me in such a pleasant way like this song did when I first listened to it. Just don't play it at 3.a.m. alone in the dark. Hehe! >:D \\"No Self Control\\" is a theme that tells the story of an Obsessive Compulsive Disorder patient who's about to commit something terrible due to the OCD disorder and finding it impossible to resist doing. The song begins with low-pitched xylophones before blasting into an explosive rocking track.  A 1 minute 20 second instrumental called \\"Start\\" is a bizarre `interlude' with a saxophone that provides the calm between the previous track and the next on but with an unpleasant calm. The quietness is suddenely ended with the banging loud drums of \\"I Don't Remember\\"The song begins with Gabriel's chaotic howling and becomes a chaotic, chilling, tale of an amnesiac who is being persecuted by authorities. The really awesome part though is the raging, blazing guitars at the ending combined with the sounds of (I guess) an alarm buzzer and the guitars and buzzer sound effects fading out will leave you with chills running throughout you. I just love those rock guitars at the ending. A piano intro brings us to what I consider the most disturbing track that PG has ever written: Family Snapshot. Don't be fooled by the title. It's a tale of an assassin who assassinates a well-known politician or entertainer just to get attention. The song gradually builds up from the calm pianos at the beginning into a scorching rock song kind of like preparing us for the terrible event that's about to occur. The song suddenly quiets down with \\"And I'll let the bullet... FLY!!!, and then the calmness brings us to a flashback of a time when the assassin as a young boy, was alone & lonely after relations between his parents turns violent and the distraught of his desperations ends the song with the echoing piano. \\"And Through The Wire\\" is a more upbeat rocker with a poppier atmosphere that tells the tale of a murderer. \\"Games Without Frontiers\\" was Gabriel's first American charting single. The song is a New Wavish, song that denounces war and tells the tale of children being forced to fight in warfare. I just love the lyrical line \\"If looks could kill, they probably will\\", CLASSIC!! If you like this version, check out the Massive/DB mix of GWF available on Pure Moods III. Where the version on here is quirky, eerie, and bleak, the version on Pure Moods III is a dark, haunting, ambient version with a much more twilight mood. Overall, the Pure Moods III version almost sounds like a totally different song altogether.  Both versions are awesome. \\"Not One Of Us\\" is another scorching rocker similar to \\"Through The Wire\\". The song from what I can understand, tells the tale of someone being singled out of a crowd, either because of ethnicity, religious belief, race, or simply because he or she is different. I love the wavy guitars at the ending. \\"Lead A Normal Life\\" is the only mellow track on the album. Don't think that this is a ballad. The first 40 or so seconds give thefeeling of the song being the nice part of the LP until ominous keyboards and the howling buzz screams come in giving the peacefulness of the song an unpleasant odor. The song eventually turns out to portray the dreamy haze of a mentally ill patient at a dilapidated mental institution. This to me, is the scariest song after \\"Intruder\\" because of it's blissful yet burning wirey eeriness. The last track \\"Biko\\" wraps up the dark mind trip of PG 3 with recording samples of a choiring protest and becomes a chilling, and eerie song with piercing guitars and African drums. \\"Biko\\" is a song dedicated to anti-apartheid activist Steven Biko, who was murdered in 1977.  The song fades back down into the protesters chanting which is ending by the sound of a drum, ending the album.<br />This album, as well as SO, stands as Gabriel's strongest, and most consistent of his entire catalog. Caution!: If you're looking for \\"Sledgehammer-like\\" or \\"In Your Eyes\\", PG3 is not the one to look for but for those who want to hear something different than what casual fans go for, PG3 is an absolute must.  . The remastered edition is astounding, bringing out more details and higher volume in the songs, giving them even more power than they did on the older masters. When the album was finished being recorded and produced, Atlantic refused to release it out of feeling that it wasn't commercial and dropped Gabriel from their label. After Peter Gabriel signed up to Geffen, had PG3 released, well, let's just say that Atlantic have regretted it ever since then.he feeling of the song being the nice part of the LP until ominous keyboards and the howling buzz screams come in giving the peacefulness of the song an unpleasant odor.

B00006CXXU|4.0|I thought this album was very surprising after her first single realeased and its controversal video! But after listening to the whole album, it was very pleasing....To highlight a few tracks:<br />2.Can't Hold Us Down-This song featuring Lil'Kim has a lot of true meaning and realistic conflict between men and women to it..All you girls listen to this song and tell me how well you relate!<br />6.Infatuation-This track she released at the Winter Olympics and ever since then I have been hooked! It's very catchy and romantic! Keep this one in mind...<br />9.Impossible-A very beautiful song featuring the phenomonal Alicia Keys herself! It starts off great and then the mood changes and gets into a \\"blues\\" type of tempo...Christina sounds great, exactly like alicia!<br />11.Beautiful-This song speaks for itself! It is a beautiful song and is a \\"make-you-feel-good-about-yourself\\" type of song! its very nice and catchy, give an honest listen!<br />18.A Voice Within-This song shows her true \\"voice within\\"...It has a disney feel to it but its such a beautiful song and christina sings it justice!<br />In conclusion, this album will surprise you! give it a try and listen!!!!!!!!!!
0446677450|5.0|I love these book it was great I like the way the author say the ideas of the book and it makes the reader exited  to complete the book and read it all. Also it helps the reader to think about the main idea of the book and compare it with the reality,because it talks about a very important idea in our live now days.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|I bought the album because some collegues told me, there are two russian girls who have produced a very good album, i heard the song ALL THE THINGS SHE SAID, and i was fascinated of them, so i went to a CD Shop in Switzerland and I bought this CD. All the other Albums i have there are 2 or 3 good songs but the rest aren't very good. So i heard to this Album 200 km/h in the wrong lane, and all 12 songs are very very good. Julia and Lena have very nice voices, i hope they will come to Switzerland, and i wish they will give the best concert we ever had in Switzerland in the Hallenstadion in Zurich. I can only say they are great and please buy this wonderful Album! I'm sure you won't worry about it!! TATU FOR PRESIDENT!
B00000AF95|1.0|After the success of Creatures Of The Night and Lick It Up, KISS decides to fire the one man who wrote the music that made them the great hits they were......Vinnie Vincent, and its no surprise that soon after he was kicked out (Paul said he was kicked out for trying to make KISS the Vinnie Vincent band), the band goes straight down hill with this album.  In a nutshell all of the songs are easily forgetable except for Heavens On Fire (which you could easily find in a ... Rock folder in most Napster libraries).  I have been a loyal KISS fan ever since 1988, have listened to most of their music.  This and the preceding 80s album are terrible.  Symbolic of KISS's 83-85 failure.<BR>I suppose the only person who could get any pleasure out of this album is a die-hard 80s metalhead.
B0000062Y2|5.0|If you seek this out because you are a fan of Broadway musicals, then you would probably prefer the original versions.  But if you are a ROCK fan, as I am, you would definitely prefer this one, because it rocks much harder. Perhaps it is because the film soundtrack has a much more American sound and feel to it that I like it so much. I think people are being unfair to Ted Neeley. I like him a lot better because his voice has this great untamed redneck quality to it that is far more appropriate for rock music than the smoother, more technically accomplished Broadway styles on the earlier version. I think the style of the soundtrack is more early-to-mid seventies than hippie - it has a harder edge.  Both the soundtrack and the film itself have more glammy and funk elements.  The movie is way more bad-..., campy and fun - I especially enjoy the S&M high priests.  Finally, it doesn't have that \\"close\\" sound that Broadway cast recordings so often and so annoyingly have, where it sounds like the entire cast is crammed into a closet.  If you just want to rock out and don't take this musical completely seriously, this is the one to get - like a lot of seventies rock, it's wonderfully over-the-top.
B00005JKZT|5.0|The Fellowship of the Ring was a near perfect adaptation of Tolkien's novel (in spirit more than in its structure), the first volume in The Lord of the Rings \\"trilogy\\" (though Tolkien himself designed it as one long book, but that's neither here nor there where the movies are concerned). Peter Jackson brought Middle-Earth to life, and maintained the emotional content of Tolkien's work as well as the adventure and spectacle. With The Two Towers, though, Peter Jackson is less successful on all grounds. The movie is neither as true to its written counterpart as the previous film, nor does it leave a sparkling aftertaste when the credits roll. For some reason, Peter Jackson decided to cut the content of The Two Towers in half for his film adaptation, only to attach it next year to the beginning of The Return of the King. For example, if you're an avid fan of Tolkien (and by God you should be!), you'll notice that Shelob is absent in film two, and so are many other events. Now, that's not to say they got the ole Glorfindel axe -not at all. Shelob will appear in film three, and so will all of the other important events that got lopped out of The Two Towers. <br />In Mr. Jackson's defense, I must add that the structure of his film would make another climax such as Shelob's a little too much to handle - I mean, after all, we've already been through Helm's Deep in all its glory. However, if Jackson had restructured his screenplay, it could have played out more like Tolkien's novel - and been the better for it... and I'm not speaking strictly as a Tolkien zealot here either. Despite the film's virtual three hours of running time, Jackson manages to deliver an ending that feels somehow rushed. It is certainly not a satisfactory conclusion that will leave you beaming. Instead, you'll be groaning and whining, \\"That's it? Another year?\\" I know that a cliffhanger was something of a given, but The Two Towers, as adapted by Jackson, doesn't complete a satisfying story arch the way he managed with The Fellowship of the Ring (and in flying colors, I hasten to add!). It can't help but be a little disappointing given this. I really wish Jackson hadn't made his fateful decision to saw The Two Towers down the middle. <br />Does this mean I'm not a fan of The Two Towers? Not by a long shot - I'm only saying that the The Fellowship of the Ring is more gratifying as a whole, and that it's a tough act to follow. My list of praises for The Two Towers is lengthy indeed! To begin with, Gollum is, without question, exactly how he should be. Not only does Gollum seem very real and alive (he's computer-generated), but his behavior is dead on. Gollum is as tragic in the film as he is on the written page, and the behind-the-FX performance is haunting and worthy of limitless honor. Just looking at Gollum evokes feelings of pity for the poor lost soul. <br />All of the performances in The Two Towers are amazing, though. The characterizations are also much nearer to Tolkien's. Gimli was mere comic relief in film 1, for example, but he shines in film 2 - and, yes, he's still very funny too, but it all feels a little more appropriate. Add to this some amazing action segments, some dazzling visual effects (much better than the lacking effects in part 1), and sometimes verbatim dialogue from Tolkien himself, and you have a movie that is exciting and dramatic both at once (just like The Lord of the Rings should be, after all!). If only the film had adhered to Tolkien's book as strictly near the end as it did at the outset... Alas! <br />The first portion of The Two Towers is a Ringer dream come true. I dare say, in fact, that the first hour of film 2 is even more true to its source material than the first hour of film 1. This was a bit misleading, because, soon enough, Jackson's liberties begin to creep in - and they're not all bad, nor are they far from the Tolkien spirit. Still, there are a few inexcusable offenses. The first, and most severe, is the film's structure, as I've mentioned, which makes a mess of what happens in which installment of the tale. The second major offense comes in the form of the elves at Helm's Deep - and I'm not moaning just because there at elves at Helm's Deep either. What I really have a problem with is Jackson's callous slaying of a Tolkien character who, however unimportant in the grand scheme of things, did not actually die in the novels. Some minor quibbles include Gandalf's lack of screen time despite his \\"resurrection,\\" and the Merry and Pippin moments which seem to be more of an afterthought than anything else. They were not given the proper amount of attention by the filmmakers, who preferred instead to throw a lot of unimportant Arwen sequences our way.  <br />All in all, The Two Towers is no Fellowship of the Ring, but what it does well, it does exceedingly well. It just feels too much like a story that was cut in half - which, essentially, is exactly what it is. As a Tolkien fanatic as well as an avid moviegoer, I object to this. Still, when all three films are completed, none of these niggles will seem as troublesome. It's the desire for more that lead to much of my disappointment in the conclusion, after all.
B00006RU5B|5.0|The CD of the year. No kidding. You know how there are albums that define a band or a moment in time. Albums like Red Hot Chilli Peppers - Blood Sugar Sex Magic, Soundgarden - Superunknown, Black Crowes -  Southern Harmony, Pride and Glory - self titled, Rolling Stones - Sticky Fingers and Led Zeppelin - Zoso (IV). Pearl Jam even got lucky and produced two in a row (Ten and Vs) but that used up all their creative juices. Well Audioslave is one of those defining albums. Take the arguably best vocalist in rock at the moment and team him with the rhythm section as solid and innovative (well Tom Morello is) from Rage Against The Machine and you have a \\"Supergroup\\" for the new millennium. Freed from the expected Rap Rock and detuned grunge of Rage and Soundgarden respectively Audioslave are able to produce intelligent rock for a new era. Great songwriting and performance abounds. I've not been able to find a bum track in a half dozen listens, and from a CD that appealed from it's first listen this is impressive. If this is not a flash in the pan and Audioslave can continue to produce material of this calibre then they are guaranteed huge success. I can't wait to see these guys perform live.
B00005JL2O|2.0|I found myself pondering a few question while watching this movie. like why did they make it? how is this funny? how many times are they going to use the same cheap joke so they can avoid actually working on a decent film? Honestly, if i would have paid 20 dollars for my wife and i to see this, the movie theater would have one less employee.

I never read a Stephen King book in my life but this one is worth reading. Im not into the genre that he writes but if youre looking for a book on writing that is down to earth, honest and real world then this is it. He gives you the way he sees it and that is valuable coming from him. A great read and a great work.

In fact, she's neither, but comparing her to modern fiction makes her seem that way, because she wrote stories which she meant to be understood by the reader.  She never muddied her waters to make them appear deep. Most people today, though, seeking depth, look for mud. Ayn Rand doesn't give it to them so they call her shallow.<br />Ayn Rand dares to present, in dramatic form, her theory of human nature, and of the essential issues which ultimately determine our success and happiness in life. This is just not done in modern fiction. Modern fiction is generally more modest in scope than most things Ayn Rand ever wrote.<br />Ayn Rand presents characters which embody important essential principles of human character (the intransigent individualist, the self-tortured worshipper, the intellectual power-luster, the material power-luster, the obsequious social climber).  In other words, extraordinary characters.  This, also, is just not done in modern fiction.  Modern fiction avoids presenting characters which are too unfamiliar to the average reader.  Instead, it presents characters which don't highlight any essential principles -- average people. It tells a story you can be comfortable with, rather than really contemplate.<br />Ayn Rand's self-confidence as a writer is bracing.  It may scare you.  It's certainly scared plenty of people enough to tell all their friends to avoid Ayn Rand like the plague.  Are you curious about what they're trying to hide you from?<br />Accept the challenge of The Fountainhead.  Then form your own opinion of it.
B000021YQV|5.0|They've changed quite a bit since the days of System of a Down. Not for the better, not for the worse, for the different. They're still quite amazing. This CD is definatly worth the price.
B00000AFDW|3.0|This CD has some of thier best songs on it and some of the worst songs.  For the most part this is a worthy effort but songs like &quot;Raise your Glasses&quot;, &quot;I Finally Found My Way To You&quot; &amp; &quot;You Wanted The Best&quot; just sound too hokey and calculated.  Think about it: a Beth II with Peter singing and a song about being back together for the reunion tour.  It's interesting to know that &quot;You Wanted The Best&quot; is the first studio song to have all four members singing(3 of the 4 sang on &quot;Kissin' Time&quot; from their first album).  Another problem with the CD is that it only has 10 songs.  I've seen Gene being quoted in magazines saying &quot;Less is more&quot; um... no, not really Gene.  I'm guessing that they couldn't come up with any more worthy material.  This is a good CD, just not a GREAT CD... we waited 19 years for this..????
B000069CWE|1.0|Hybrid theory was GREAT. This does it no justice and I cant stand almost EVERY song on the CD. I'm glad I didnt buy it!
B000002H33|5.0|This album is just simply amazing. It's my favorite of all time nothing else even comes close.The opening track'Battery' is the ultimate in poetic fury telling of a violent father terrorising his family.The title track is eight minutes of unrefined metal and has the best intro i have ever heard.<BR>                                         Cliff Burton was the best bassist ever and his work on 'The thing that should not be'immediatly puts you in awe.It's a haunting classic. 'Welcome home sanitarium' is the slowest track on the album and resembles 'Fade to Black' somewhat from 'Ride the lightning' with it's dark acoustics progressing to a beautifully heavy climax based on themes of pain and death.It is Metallica's 'Stairway to Heavan'.'Leper Messiah' is my personal favorite on the album. Burtons bass is just awesome, Hetfield's vocals rampant in the heat of metal.'Orion' is an incredible seven minute instrumental and showed again just how important Cliff Burton was to Metallica.While their career was decent in the aftermath of his death never again would they be capable of putting an album of this calibre - THE BEST, speaking of which, the best is saved for last on this album, the greatest piece of metal ever written and performed, 'Damage Inc.'.<BR>                                                Don't get me wrong Metallica are still good, very good.Albums like 'The Black Album' and 'load' are brilliant albums by any standards,but when compared to this work of genius it's like hearing two completely different bands. Cliff RIP.We sure miss you now.
B00000JCOV|5.0|This CD is amazing. To clear up some stuff. There are 9 members to maintain the speed and heavyness. Honest heaviness is much better than pedals and stuff to make one guitar sound like 3, etc etc. Also if you get this CD listen to every song. People generally listen to 2-6 over and over. But Diluted has awesome lyrics, any song that starts off &quot;I'm cold, I'm ugly, I'm always confused by everything&quot; and then goes on to say &quot;God, what the f--k is wrong?&quot; is a great song.<br />Buy this album... twice!<br />If you're a real slipknot fan you should buy a used copy of the first edition with Purity on it, or just download the song Purity.
0446677450|4.0|This book is very well written.  It simply describes the ways to make money.  It provides simple pictures to help the reader to comprehend what the author is describing.  There are also many short stories that help to keep the reader attentive and drawn into the book.  The stories are also very helpful in understanding the concepts presented.<br />Even though the book is very well written, it also seems to be very repetitive.  The repetition may be used to have the messages sink into the readers' brains, but it is a little much.  The same points seem to be made over and over again instead of moving on to new topics.  <br />It is an entertaining book and I recommend it to anyone interested in money.  Robert Kiyosaki really makes the reader think about money and how to earn it.  Money does not necessarily flow to those that went to many years of college. It just depends how much knowledge the person has of how to earn and keep earning the money.
B00005A46T|3.0|This is too heavy for slipknot, honestly they suck at stuff this hard. Most of the lyrics are horrible. The riffs are repeditive and if they're not repeditive they're annoying. Instead of getting this CD buy a used copy of their CD Slipknot (The first edition, with Purity... such a good song). Thats my two cents.
B00005YU1O|5.0|Waking Life is a problematic and beautiful movie but not for the reasons that most people have with this film. I am relieved whenever I come across a movie that takes an interesting idea and allows itself as a film to become wrapped around its content. The challenging aspect of Waking Life though is that the content varies from the completely cerebral to the sophmoric. Which I suppose is the challenge of making a stream-of-conciousness take on the dreamstates of life, cinema, and art. The use of rotoscope throughout the film makes it seem like a  dream-state of the movie 'Slacker'. <br />For those who dismiss it simply as a hashing of 'Philosophy 101' concepts or a forum for Generation  X rants, they are missing the point entirely. At its best, Waking Life is a compelling call to action for the re-awakening of the collective and individual senses of wonder and imagination that have been bastardized by the market-culture.  If its guilty of being a little too gimmicky, its completely redeemed by providing a challenge to the audience, art, and the cinematic medium.
B000007T1M|5.0|Originality, beat, power, anger, craziness. These guys are awesome. Some of the best stuff I've heard in the nu-metal genre. It's amazing, It's worth the 15 bux. Pick it up.
B00005T30L|2.0|Any resemblance to the Daniel Clowes' graphic novel upon which 'Ghost World' is based is purely cosmetic. The quiet essence of teenage angst that Clowes captured so brilliantly in his monochromatic drawings is lost somewhere in the translation.<br />Not that the movie can't be assused of not trying...director Zwigoff just tries so hard he almost belittles his audience's intelligence. Its as though he used Clowes' basic characterization and plot structure to present his own frustrations with society, art, and cinema. Zwigoff uses the relationship between characters as a foil to the frustration of the creative individual in such a regimented market-driven country. I don't have issue with this per se...it just follows the trappings of the 'American Beauty' syndrome: soulful frustrated characters drifting through mediocrity with convenient typical ultra-liberal Hollywood plot twists. <br />Parodied situations in this vein are throughout 'Ghost World'. In the end, the two main characters are so good-looking, you have to wonder if they would really be so angst-ridden. It eventually gets so repetative, it borders on the tedious towards its own anticlimactic conclusion.
B00006JKLI|5.0|Reading the newsletter from the Yesmagazine I discovered they released a 5.1 dolby surround ( inc. DTS) version (a.k.a DVD-A disc) from the Fragile album.<br />That made me curious and I started reading the discription of the DVD-A. All the tracks and America as a bonus in 5.1 or DTS and also lyrics,and a timeline of the band.<br />Playable on most DVd players.<br />Ok, that was information enough so I ordered the DVD and today it arrived with the post.<br />Excitement, when the disc went into the player. Would it work on my Pioneer DVD player?<br />No worry! It immediately started with roundabout and I had to take a seat.<br />What a crystal clear sound !! What did we miss all these years !! Couldn't believe there could be any progress in the sound as I knew it, but what did I know??!!<br />Listen to these classic songs as Roundabout, Long Distance Roundabout, Mood For A Day, Heart of The Sunrise or the Paul Simon song :America!<br />You won't believe your ears. There is so much more to hear if you compare it with the regular CD. Every instrument comes to you clearly as if you were there when they recorded it.<br />The DTS sound is even an asset for audio DVD and not only for movies or concerts!!<br />What strikes me on this release is the singing and the harmony. So clear, so sharp!!<br />Yes is at your home and you have a private concert. Can't wait on the release of other masterpieces like Close to the Edge, Relayer and Going For the One, to name but a few.
038533558X|3.0|This was my first Harlan Coben book. I've yet to read his acclaimed Mylon Bolitar series. I didn't enjoy this book as much as other reviewers. I found the main protaganist's continuing self-effacement irritating, and his naive notions on youth homelessness and prostitution a bit preachy. There was some pseudo-philosophy thrown in for good measure early on, and this tended to grate as well. Once the writer refrained from instructing the reader, a pretty good thriller emerged. However, like Jeffery Deaver, Coben is a devotee of labyrithine plots and absurd twists, which I think takes the edge off believabilty and fails to provide the gritty realism I like in crime and thriller genres. All that aside, it's an entertaining read 7/10.
0066214122|1.0|Crichton's latest novel is interesting, but as I read it I began to wonder. And then it struck me. Desert sand for desert snow. Helicopters. Isolated buildings in the Nevada desert v isolated buildings in the Antarctic. Shapeshifting aliens v shapeshifting aliens (nanomachines), which can take on human form. Blood in the perti dish test v an awful tasting virus drink test. Flamethrowers v thermite. The result was John Carpenter's &quot;Thing&quot;, which was based upon the short story, &quot;Who Goes There?&quot; by John W. Campbell. In the Prey, the nanomachines were an original twist, in that they were man-made aliens, but not much else. <BR>Crichton also dwells on the mundane, and often repeats the science, as if there were going to be an exam after completing the book. And do we really need lines of computer text in the story? <BR>Finally, I did not care for the denoement. As a reader, I am smart enough to figure out how the pieces of a story come together in the climatic scene, if the author is clever enough to tell a good story. Most disappointing.
B00005YW4H|5.0|This is this best album and best new artist I have heard in years!<BR>She communicates right to your soul!! I have purchased 6 albums to give to friends.
0446677450|4.0|Well I think the topic and teachings in this book were excellent and very clever. It wasn't about him being lectured about the different paths in life it was about him EXPERIENCING those paths which is a very valuable lesson and u learn so much more through experience. The author does repete things a lot and stretches out the story but in a sense I think the repetition is good because people LEARN through REPETITION. It was a good topic and it was an easy read.
0684833395|5.0|Heller was one of the few authors who could make me laugh out loud constantly.  After reading this book for the first time, I read every Joseph Heller book I could get my hands on.  None of them equaled this book, but none of them disappointed me either.<br />This is the story of a group of pilots and their crews in World War II.  The main character wants to get out.  He claims he's going crazy, but the fact that he's afraid of getting killed proves he can think rationally, which proves he's not crazy.  If he stops worrying about getting killed and requesting a discharge, that will show that he is crazy, but then he won't want the discharge.  That's basically what Catch-22 is.<br />The book is filled with memorable characters from Major Major to Milo Minderbinder.  If you enjoyed the movie MASH, you should really love this one.
0446677450|5.0|Rich Dad Poor Dad was a great book. It taught me the differences between assets and liabilities in a different perspective. It also opened my eyes to to the many possiblities of making money, much easier ways.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|I loved t.A.T.u's CD. It was wonderful.. Some songs I know how it would feel.. Its a great cd to get an understanding on how relationships can be... and they did a great Job... I would greatly suggest that you buy it and really get a 1st hand look and see how great it is yourself.. :)
B000062XM6|4.0|The Abyss - wonderful film, the special effects, I thought, were superb.  This is one film, where you can sit down, with a big bag of sweets and enjoy.  Definitely one to experience.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|T.A.T.U. is one of the best groups i have heard in a very long time! This cd is a cd everyone that like anykind of music should get! I give this a 15 out of 10!
B00006JJ1O|5.0|I think this album as great as it appears(and is), is just the beginning of what T.A.T.U. has to offer.  These two girls, Lena and Yulia, were picked with a purpose, and oh what a purpose they are serving.  After I bought this album, I ordered there original Russian album, and like that just as much. People underestimate how hard it is to become successful in the U.S. especially being a foreign band, but the girls are handling it well.  Best of luck with future albums, I can't wait to hear them.  I never get bored of listening to their cd, no matter what mood I am in.
B00005QIPH|5.0|one of the best bands there are and i am an all around listener so its okay to say that, anyways I recomend this cd to all and i also recomend you don't buy the white stripes cds
B000068OSK|1.0|first of all if you want to spend money on music get the strokes second of all if i could rate this a negative five i would
B000069CWE|5.0|This album is the greatest thing.However if you cant accept rock and rap together, then I recomend not to buy it!
B000002UDB|5.0|John Lennon used this tongue in cheek quote when introducing \\"I Am the Walrus\\" on a New York radio station back in 1974.  \\"And this is for the ELO freaks...\\"  He always had a way with words!<br />As many of you know, this started out as just an EP in the UK with the 1st 6 songs (what us Americans called our \\"side 1\\" in the vinyl days) since they were in the TV movie.  Paul pretty much had the lion's share of the songwriting on this, since 3 out of the 6 songs are his.  It starts out with the majestic \\"Magical Mystery Tour,\\" a great way to start the record/movie (of course, the music was much better than the movie itself, which has its moments and that's it).  Then we have one of Paul's best tracks lyrically \\"The Fool on the Hill.\\"  The fool is just like any of us, carefree and resented because of it and the music is dreamy and relaxing.  Then we have a rare instrumental from the Fab 4- \\"Flying.\\"  It sounds like a bluesy psychedellic montage, with singing harmonies (the ending sounds almost like a spaceship landing).  Next is George's trippy \\"Blue Jay Way,\\" which is just an inside joke about George waiting for a friend of his while on holiday in LA.  The frustration is played out with only one chord!  Paul's vaudevillian \\"Your Mother Should Know\\" follows this.  The real gem is John's \\"I Am the Walrus,\\" one of the best \\"weird\\" songs ever!  It features John's trademark wordplay \\"elementary penguin singing Hare Krishna, man, you should've seen them kicking Edgar Alan Poe.\\"  Great lyric, whatever it means!  It also features strings, chanting \\"everybody's got one\\" (which, as a kid, sounded like \\"everybody smokes pot\\"), a few snippets of King Lear \\"Set you down, Father, rest you.\\"  I'll save further comments on the movie when I review it.<br />\\"Side 2\\" is merely a collection of singles.  \\"Hello Goodbye\\" is featured merely as the movie credits roll.  It's a nice singalong, if you will.  Then we have the 1st release from the Beatles in the year 1967- \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" and \\"Penny Lane.\\"  Both are places in Liverpool.  John's \\"Strawberry Fields\\" is really 2 tracks on one (if you're interested in where it breaks into the 2nd track, listen carefully after the 1st verse).  Like the \\"Walrus,\\"  it has heavy strings, horns, psychedellic wordplay (albeit more personal and introspective, \\"No one I think is in my tree\\") and sound effects (an autoharp, Ringo's march beat at the end and \\"cranberry sauce,\\" what many believed to be \\"I buried Paul\\").  Paul's \\"Penny Lane\\" follows this, it's simpler with scenes of everyday life, \\"a barber showing photographs of every head he's had the pleasure to have known,\\" a fireman with a \\"clean machine\\" and a nice picollo trumpet solo in the middle.  \\"Baby You're a Rich Man\\" is interesting enough.  There are rumours that it's about Brian Epstein, who was still living during the release of this song.  Finally, it closes with John's anthemic \\"All You Need Is Love,\\" which debuted on TV worldwide in the summer of love.  It opens with the French national anthem and features bits of \\"In the Mood,\\" \\"Greensleeves,\\" and their own \\"She Loves You.\\"  As Ringo said in The Beatles Anthology, \\"That song was for bloody love and peace!\\"
B00005JLRR|4.0|I found Nemesis to be an enjoyable movie. Many have been critical of the film for its lack of a creative story line.  I am in agreement with that criticism. Although, I'm sure the critics would be praising the flick if it were an \\"Arnold\\" or \\"Bruce\\" film.  As shootem-up space cowboy films go, this is a good one.<br />BUT, I think we are long overdue for a real scifi adventure.  Surely, there are enough interesting story lines from any of the Trek series upon which to develop a real scifi adventure. One that has imagination and the feeling of the awesomeness that only scifi as a genre can bring.<br />I'm not tired of Trek.  I watch the reruns of all the series.  I tune it faithfully to see Enterprise.  I will continue to do so, because its the best viewing on the tube.<br />But, scifi films in general are suffering.  The last movie to step outside the \\"cowboys in space\\" formula was Mission to Mars.  It borrowed from a lot of different films.  But, at least it was an attempt to do something different.  (Although it seemed everyone hated the flick.  I didn't!)<br />TNG needs a new, younger crew!  Maybe draw some members from the other series to feel the roles on the Enterprise. (I wouldn't mind seeing 7of9 on the big screen!)  But, most importantly we need some real innovation in the story line.  The best episodes from any of the TV series are the ones that made the viewer think and wonder.  Don't stop making movies.  Stop making the same movie over and over again.
0385720920|5.0|Chuck Palahniuk fabricates an alternative world of delusions and bleakness in Choke. He uses the novel as his canvas to paint shock, black humor, confusion, and irony but at the same time, scattered with gemstones of truth.  The development of character and plot flow in one stream of concsiousness toward chaos, therby enforcing his themes.<br /> Chuck Palahniuk takes full advantage of the shock effect and lures his audience of young minds into his eccentric world of dark philosophy.  The anarchic escapades of our protagonist, Victor Mancini, serves as a vehicle for the authors satirical take on our society. His works certainly cater to mainstream readers yearning for something different.<BR> <BR> The author takes pop culture how it's given to him, digests it, and spits it out in the form of Victor Mancinni, a medical school dropout, and blooming sex addict in a 12 step program. At this point he realized all the virtues his mom had taught him were lies. <BR> <BR> Victor dines out in bourgeoise restaurants and deliberately chokes on food waiting to be rescued.  In the aftermath, these good semaritans sympathesize and send him birthday cards every week, like he was their own child. He learned this during childhood when he almost died eating a corndog.  <BR> <BR> His facade for this scenario is that he's staying the underdog to contrast with his saviors superiority, claiming that his saviors do this to save themselves.  He secretely likes to think that hes putting adventure into peoples lives full of incompletes.  The truth is that hes only doing it for the money.<BR> <BR> He had hope, goals, promises of impossible happiness if he worked hard enough, suffered, and tried to help others for this is what his mommie told him.  <BR> <BR>  Another example of Victors christ complex, is when he finds an opportunity to fake a scapegoat and starts admitting to crimes that senile old ladies accused him of doing, when he had not committed any at all. \\"The Titanic thing, I did that.That Kennedy assasination deal, yeah, that was me.  The AIDS bug? Sorry.  Me, again.\\"  For some reason, this sparks compassion into the old wrecks and creates a more peacful living environment at Saint Anthony's Medical Institute.<BR> <BR> In the closing of our tale, Victor crosses the line between delusion and psychosis into believing that he is Jesus Christ and says \\" I want to become a better person.\\"  Ironically, when he actually attempts in helping his institutionalized mother in feeding her a ridiculously excessive amount of pudding, she chokes and dies.<BR> <BR> Every one of these scenes are portrayed as being very anti-climactic. As excitement is built up it takes a sudden dive back to nowhere. For him, the only way to make ends meet is to create an alternative reality.<br /> To summarize, the plot and character go well together as they progress into psychosis hand in hand. The book is a study of absurdity; one disallusionment preceeding the other. The message of the novel seems ( I say \\"seems\\" because the dialougue is coated with messages upon messages that makes the book totally arbitrary; like the readers own working space) to be that  one can get ahead in life, or solve a problem, by changing the way we percieve things. Ergo, truth is relative; you escape pain by constructing your own mental environment in a way that comforts you.<BR> <BR> The beautiful way in which Chuck Palahnuk describes setting and actions using every literary device to the last detail counterbalances the negative aspects of his philosophy and makes the book easy to swallow. No pun intended.
B0000029GA|5.0|This album is nothing like any other Nas release. It is nothing like the average ghetto influenced music of your everyday thugs. Nas's lyrics are always descriptive and powerful, his delivery is always interesting, and the production is immaculate: an old school feel with quality sound. There is not a dull moment. Every song will make you think and the production makes this an album to bump with your windows rolled down. I honestly believe that there is not a single filler line on the entire album and not one thing that could be improved. Whether you like Nas or not and whether you like hip-hop or not, you should own this album because it's an incredible piece of work that stands out from its own genre as one of the greatest lyrical achievements of all time.

B00006GFAB|1.0|Este grandes éxitos tiene el problema del bloque del grupo, por lo que se han dedicado ha introducir canciones de la época en la formaban los cuatro componentes originales, como consecuencia se han sobrepasado con los discos &quot;Kiss&quot;, &quot;Hotter than hell&quot;, &quot;Love gun&quot; y &quot;Rock'n roll over&quot;.<br />Si dijeras que los cinco discos olvidados no contenian ninguna obra a resaltar sería comprensible la actitud del recopilatoria, pero se han dejado atras de forma imperdonable, la mejor balada del grupo y una de las mejores de todos los tiempos &quot;Reason to live&quot;. Si se continua por ese camino, uno se pone las botas: del Unmasked &quot;Shandi&quot; por ejemplo, del Animalize &quot;Heaven`s on fire&quot; otra ausencia imperdonable, del Asylum &quot;Uh, all night&quot;, del Crazy Nights la mencionada anteriormente o &quot;I'll fight hell to hold&quot;, y del Psycho Circus el golpe metal del mismo nombre o &quot;Within&quot; o &quot;Dreamin&quot;.

B000059XUO|5.0|It's a shame that Brandon Lee wasn't able to experience true fame; this movie would've brought it to him. Throughout the entire movie there's a confusing mix of feelings - wanting to see him obtain revenge, wishing their was some justification for the wrongs done to him, and wondering what mysterious turn the plot will take next. The movie has excellent fighting sequences and wonderful directing. The way Brandon Lee could present himself as such an enraged person, the way he would talk to his victims before exacting his revenge upon them, how he didn't hesitate to do what was necessary, and how after the horrible events that took place a year before he was resurrected, he could still find redemption in his past-life memories. He even managed to twist in a moderate amount of comedy with his angry side, which is in my mind, true talent as an actor. I never knew he was Bruce Lee's son until several years after I saw the film, and even then I found out he had been killed during the making of it. Splicing the morbid atmosphere with a suspenseful rage-filled main character, out to bring justice to his killers, &quot;The Crow&quot; brings a touch of numerous emotions with every scene.<br />Brandon Lee; may he rest in peace, and never be forgotten.
B00005JKZT|3.0|I agree with the other reviewers that this is indeed a wonderful film, beautifully created with great acting. That said, it was quite disappointing in the many points where it diverged from the book. I'm not such a stickler that I can't handle a few differences -- I agreed with all of the changes made to Fellowship that were necessary to make the story flow on screen. But making Faramir a bad guy? And what's the deal with the wimpy Ents? Visually appealling, but an intellectual let down. I almost wish I didn't love the books so I could have enjoyed the movie. Almost, but not quite.
0060273224|5.0|The world created by Garth Nix is both creative and captivating.  From the beginning with a mysterious stranger, to the end with a heroic final missive from Sabriel, tearing your eyes away from the page is the hardest thing you'll ever do!
B00005JKZT|5.0|Thats what the rest of Hollywood will have to do after Peter Jackson has finished his trilogy. \\"The Two Towers\\" surpasses its predecessor in every way possible - scale, action, humor, plot and acting. As \\"Fellowship..\\" was clearly Elijah Wood's film, this one has Viggo Mortensen written all over it. Aragorn all but steals the show and engages in some of the most spectacular battle sequences ever filmed. I'm sure that all know the story by now, but the Helm's Deep sequence at the end of the film is truly all that it has been hyped up to be. A jaw-dropping, knee shaking, and breathless sequence that can only be described as a medieval version of the Alamo.<br />Jackson's skillful eye for detail has made this remarkable film an instant classic, and ranks this trilogy right alongside the original Star Wars trilogy in terms of epic entertainment. A thrill a minute ride that will be sure to ellicit numerous viewings...saw it today and I am going to see it on Friday already!! Don't want to spoil anything, but the Ents' assault on Isengard was my favorite part, with Helm's Deep a close second. Could strongly challenge for a Best Picture Oscar...yeah, its that damned good.

Lyrically amazing in its brutal honesty, only comparable to the likes of Cobain, Lennon and Townshend, musically exquisite and impeccably performed - guitarists should really check it out! -  it shows every angle of one of the best guitarist, songwriters and live act ever.<br />You're in for a rough, emotionally roller-coaster-like ride: this is a truly amazing, excellent, unforgettable record.
0679720200|5.0|the previous review just got me riled.  the whole thing about existentialism is that it's the philosophy of no philosophy, \\"existence precedes essence,\\" etc.  life is implicitly meaningless, the individual honestly confronts the abyss and creates his/her own meaning.  as kierkegaard wrote, \\"all truth is subjectivity.\\"  meurseault is the quintessential existential character because he exists \\"beyond good and evil\\", in the \\"teleological suspension of the ethical\\", and ignores established morality.  basically, any individual philosophy that is honest and stays true to concrete facts, without dreaming up alternative realities but rather confronting the present, is existential. and this book is very that.  in a realm where \\"god is dead\\", the individual is everything: the foundation of a new ethical standard.<br />any true existentialist wouldn't call themselves \\"existential\\", since it's not a category.  it's the category of those that refuse categorization.
B0000060NF|5.0|Marvin Gaye's 'What's Goin On' is one of those albums so warm, inviting and engaging that its draws you in from your first listen and begs to me replayed. From the genre-defining, perfectly soul-pop of the title track, which shows off Gaye's fantastic voice to its best, to the free-flowing jazzy epic 'Right On' and the stark, closing 'Inner City Blues', this is a real masterwork.<br />It is a beautiful, flowing masterpiece of a work; fitting together so perfectly. This is the kind of album for every person, even those who don't like soul generally, calling to mind hopes, dreams and love. The lyrics are also both socio-political (What's Goin On, Mercy Mercy Me) and religious (God Is Love, Wholly Holy). Gaye also shows off his worth as a brilliant producer. No collection is complete without this album.
1583762027|5.0|This book is really quite simple but was just what I needed.<br />I had previously read Covey Leadership Center's &quot;First Things First&quot; time management and liked it, but found it cumbersome to go through the whole planning process. I would have great intentions and try to stay on track, but then get distracted and bogged down again. Complicated planning processes don't always work for us procrastinators!<br />Tracy's book is much simpler but it actually has been much more effective for me. I liked the imagery of a big, green, bulgey-eyed frog representing my most important task that I really wanted to procrastinate. My husband and I now have fun laughing about which &quot;big frogs&quot; are hopping around our desk! For some reason, it really helps me focus and get a great deal of satisfaction knowing that I have eaten my &quot;daily froggie&quot;.<br />Now every day I concentrate on just indentifying my &quot;frog&quot; task and making sure it gets done. If I do only that, my effectiveness goes up for all the other tasks as well. Amazing!
B00007E8O5|5.0|Simply put, this album is a must have for any hard rock fan. This album was obviously written when Jerry was not in the best state of mind. But whatever personal hell he was going through resulted in one of the most powerful pieces of music ever produced. Few, if any, musicians, have released so much incredible material at one time. The brilliance displayed in the original 14-song release is built upon in the full version.<br />Certain songs have a strong Alice In Chains vibe to them, which is certainly quite a compliment. At the same time, Jerry continues to move forward and improve his ability as a front man. \\"Psychotic Break\\" can best be described as a wall of sound that hints at what is to come for the listener. Jerry doesn't let up with the ultra-heavy \\"Bargain Basement Howard Hughes,\\" and \\"Owned.\\" The opening songs, dark lyrically and sonically, are quickly countered by the catchy \\"Angel Eyes.\\" The beautifully done acoustic number \\"Solitude\\" follows.<br />\\"Mother's Spinning In Her Grave,\\" \\"Hellbound,\\" \\"Spiderbite,\\" and \\"Pro Falso Idol\\" are powerful, guitar-driven numbers and are some of Jerry's best solo compositions to date. The slow and dark \\"Feel The Void\\" is a welcom change of pace, with intricate harmonies and different guitar and bass tones.<br />The autobiographical lyrics and strong chorus of \\"Locked On\\" make the song one of the album's stand-out's. \\"Gone\\" has a country feel to it, and is a nice way to wrap up the album. Jerry's lead work over strummed acoustic chords is extremely tasteful as always.<br />The second disc opens with \\"Castaway,\\" which starts slow and builds to a sea of vocals and guitars. \\"Chemical Tribe\\" goes in several different directions, and finishes with a great chorus.<br />\\"What It Takes\\" has a more laid-back feel at times, along with some more wailing on the guitar. \\"Dying Inside\\" balances heavy and acoustic riffs, with some very metal-sounding leads. \\"Siddhartha\\" incorporates unique sounds, and is quickly followed by the amazing instrumental \\"Hurts Don't It?\\" The emotional playing and layered lead parts make the 4 and half minute song fly by.<br />\\"She Was My Girl\\" has more of a pop sound, but Jerry wails away over heavy riffs. \\"Pig Charmer\\" has some of the more interesting lyrics, and Cantrell's voice sounds similar to the late Layne Staley at times.<br />\\"Anger Rising\\" is a straight ahead rocker with brilliant harmonized vocals in the song's intro and outro. \\"SOS\\" offers a further glimpse into Cantrell's mental and physical state, while \\"Give It A Name\\" goes from an upbeat and bluesy intro to a moody chorus with more great harmonies.<br />\\"Thanks Anyway\\" has the feel of a great AIC song, and is one of the better new songs. \\"31/32\\" has more deep lyrics concerning Cantrell's life, and has a country sound similar to \\"Gone.\\"<BR>Roadrunner has lucked out getting Jerry Cantrell, and this album is one of the best, and underappreciated CD's to date. He further establishes himself as a top-notch guitarist, songwriter, and vocalist, and hopefully Jerry will be back out to play the new material shortly.
0783225733|5.0|I love this movie so much, it has encouraged me to be an astronaut. I would love to also be an actor in a movie with either Bill Paxton, Tom Hanks, or Kevin Bacon starring in it. I am the one that loves science and am facinated by how they survived, and how Fred Haise (Bill Paxton) could survive a 104 degrees fever. I mean, the highest fever I've ever heard of is 103 degrees, which I have had in some cases. Though I am only 12, I will continue to yearn to be an astronaut or an actor and love scientific movies and so on. But I am not a total whiz kid, you see. I'm just like other &quot;kids&quot; as adults may call us. If you like scientific movies such as &quot;Twister&quot; or &quot;The Perfect Storm&quot;, then you'll love Apollo 13, trust me.
B00000G3Q4|5.0|Well, as far as the actual movie itself the Elite DVD version is superior. I have both the Book Of The Dead Anchor Bay edition and the Elite version. The Anchor Bay version is very nice just for the extras and packaging (even though it smells like model glue!). However, the Elite version presents the movie in it's original 1:33 full-screen aspect ratio, exactly as it was filmed and originally released. The Anchor Bay versions present The Evil Dead in a new 1:85 Widescreen transfer which actually blocks out some of the movie at the top and bottom of the screen. It looks nice, but was it really necessary?<br />Anchor Bay is by far my favorite DVD company, but they really goofed up on the Widescreen transfer in The Book Of The Dead...they should have included both the new Widescreen and Original full-screen versions.<br />Oh well, the Elite version has recently went down in price to where if you are a fan of The Evil Dead you can just buy both editions.
0671015206|5.0|This book uncovers many of the myths that surrond the American Millionaire. This book suggests that most millionaires in America are extremely thrifty and frugal despite the common belief they all drive expensive cars and live in huge houses. This book also distinguishes the difference between being wealthy and having a high income. Overall, it is very interesting and well worth your time.

B00005JKZT|5.0|This one in a way reminded me of Star Wars Episode II. That means it had a much more exciting plot, more character developement, better special effects, better acting, and a more complex plot line. This was better than Episode II because it had better acting. The special effects were incredible, and the pace of the movie made it seem like 1 hour instead of 3 hours and 15 minutes. See this now, it is the best movie of 2002!
B000001EAQ|4.0|Everybody has maligned this record, the third in a trio of records marking U2's decade of experimentation.  These detractors seem to include the casual fans of the band and seem to be based more upon repeated viewings of the \\"Discotheque\\" video and the knee-jerk reactions of initial reviews than any substantive criticisms.<br />But get one thing clear right up front - this is no simple techno or dance record.  To be sure, the first three songs have those elements, but so do alot of other U2 songs from records that do not garner such criticism (such as its predecessors 'Achtung Baby' (1991) and 'Zooropa' (1993)).  Despite the title, 'Pop' (1997) requires the listener to \\"look for baby Jesus under the trash.\\"  Lyrically speaking, the most techno-drenched tune, \\"Mofo\\", is also one of Bono most laid-bare lyrical moments ever.  And musically, for every tune with phat beats, there is a traditional balladesque number (\\"Staring at the Sun\\" and \\"If God Would Send His Angels\\") or a scorching rocker (\\"Gone\\" and \\"Last Night on Earth\\").  Indeed, an actual listen to this record should dispel any notions that the band lost connection with their musical influences and larger themes.<br />To be sure, there is clearly fluff that could have best been left to b-sides (\\"Miami\\" and \\"The Playboy Mansion\\") that keeps this record from being ranked among classics 'The Joshua Tree' (1987) or 'Achtung Baby' (1991).  But if there is any fair comparison to its much-lauded, \\"return-to-form\\" successor 'All That You Can't Leave Behind' (2000), it would be the distinctive darkness of 'Pop'.  From the outright cynicism of \\"Do You Feel Loved\\", to the brooding atmosphere of \\"If You Wear That Velvet Dress\\", to the spiritual pleading of \\"Wake Up Dead Man\\", this is one heavy mother.  Nonetheless, it must be said that \\"Please\\" is simply one of U2's best lyrical and musical moments ever and was criminally-omitted from the recent 'The Best of 1990-2000' (2002).<br />In sum, in the same sense that there couldnot have been a classic like 'The Joshua Tree' without its experimental predecessor, 'The Unforgettable Fire' (1984), there could not have been an optimistic record like 'All That You Can't Leave Behind' without 'Pop'.
B000002UAO|5.0|By mid 1965, the Beatles had released 5 great albums, then in late 65 came this, considered by many one of the best albums ever, by anyone,and with good reason... This was a huge step forward...,a giant step forward in the world of music,and it sounds stunning today!!!
B00005B36H|5.0|I have been listening to tool since sub-pop.  Very few bands have ever made such a powerful impression on me.  I am not afraid to admit that I disliked this band for quite a while after I first heard them.  I was struck like a passerby watching a car accident.  I just couldn't stop listening.  The music created by this band is intense and ground breaking.  They have constantly grown and changed from the very beginning.  They are so radically aggressive that they will not even settle for the stream they made for themselves.  It is so rare to find a band that has a new and progressive sound with every new album.  This album shows notes of increasing depth that leaves me in awe.  If this music doesn't crawl under your skin to wrench the heart out of your chest...you are a hollow shell.
B00005JKZT|5.0|I saw this movie yesterday, and already I've overheard one comment from the theater I was at, as well as a comment from a workmate, who said that they were disappointed with something(s) about this movie. Whether it'd be that it didn't follow the book EXACTLY, or it just wasn't as good as the first. I understand that it doesn't follow the book exactly, but I beg to differ as far as it not being as good as the first movie.<br />Sure, it doesn't follow the book exactly. Neither did the last one. In fact, as far as I know, there were probably just as many differences from the book in this movie as there were in the last. For example, in the book of \\"The Fellowship of the Ring,\\" Gandalf takes many years to get back to the Shire(wasn't it like 50 years?) before he tells Frodo to set off on his quest to destroy the One Ring. Also, the ENTIRE Tom Bombadil scene was cut from the movie - including the scene where they obtain the swords to kill the Nazgul where they meet the Barrow-wights (I assume that perhaps the swords that Aragorn gave the hobbits at Weathertop are the swords that kill the Nazgul, but I can't be certain). Also, dialogue was switched around from what it was in the book, like someone in the movie saying a line that was originally someone else's line in the book. Or the same person who said a line in the book says it in the movie but at a different point in the story(a.k.a. Gandalf's \\"all we need to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us\\" speech and his story of Gollum; in the book it was at Bag End, but in the movie it was in Moria.) Also, we never see Gandalf talk to Radagast the Brown (another wizard). And, Boromir dies at the end of the movie, whereas he died at the beginning of the second book. Lastly, they never went to Farmer Maggot's house where we discover that Merry and Pippin knew something about Bilbo having the One Ring. And I know there were more changes.<br />And what changes were made to \\"The Two Towers' story in the movie? Faramir was meaner, they didn't go to Gondor, we don't see Saruman wandering the woods, Elves were at Helm's Deep, Wormtongue makes it to Isengard before the Ents flooded it, Arwen was in it, Eowen went with them, and certain things were pushed back until the third movie. There were a few more, but there were not many more changes than what was done in the first film. And that's not what gets me. What gets me is that people complain about these changes, and NONE of them were bad! The movie still worked very well! It still stayed 90-95% true to the book(if you got that percentage on a term paper - that's an A grade my friends!). The only reason anyone would see these changes as bad is because <snobby, whiny & complaining voice>\\"It wasn't in the books!\\"</snobby, whiny & complaining voice><br />Come on! This movie was fantastic! It's still very true to the book, Gollum was cool and funny, Gimli was hilarious, and the battles were so epic in scale it's not even funny. The Ents were just as I had pictured them - both character and visual-wise. The conflict with Frodo, Sam, and Gollum was perfect. Helm's Deep was terrific and very epic in scope. And the destruction of Isengard was just amazing. We really got a great picture.<br />I think ultimately when one goes to a movie and comes out loving it, they will build up the sequels to such high expectations that they end up disappointed. Why not just expect the sequels to NOT be as good, since it's impossible to capture lightning in a bottle - and then come out not so disappointed?<br />This movie was awesome. Just as great as the first one.<br />Rating: 10/10
B00005NP04|5.0|This is one great list of greatest hits! <BR>She is one sexy siren of country music. <BR>This is a great reflection of what she has given us so far.   Songs like WHEN GOD FEARIN' WOMEN GET THE BLUES (good ole down and dirty Hill Billy country), BLESSED, CONCRETE ANGEL & WHERE WOULD YOU BE (bone chilling great-what a voice).<BR>In the realm of greatest hits, this surpasses all others; country or otherwise. She is one grand diva of country music. She is definitely a living legend.<BRBR>This is a great cd to have if you love country music and especially Martina.

B00006JJ1O|5.0|This has got to be one of the best cd's ever I even love the Russian songs. I love the whole lesbian thing too it's so cute and real. Everyone has got to watch just one real show of them singing and doing there thing and they'll understand. I can't wait to really get to see them in person since all there songs are gr8!!!!!!! The best one is 30 Minutes especially.
B00005JKZT|5.0|Peter Jackson is going to be a legend in Hollywood. For the first time in my life, I sat down to a sequel that literally felt like it simply picked up where the other film left off. Filming all three films at once undoubtedly contributed to this. The characters, the mood, and the intensity of the first film were unchanged because the actors never had to break character. And even though visual effects abound, the use of actual full scale sets and thousands of extras for battle scenes were an obvious impact on the performance of the actors and actresses. As good as everyone is, the film belongs to Gollum. He is the character you will leave thinking about. His grotesque, sympathetic, and sometimes even humorous persona is animated and performed to absolute perfection. He is truly the most believable CG character on screen to date. If any CG character could ever be nominated for a best actor oscar, it should be Smeagol.<br />For Tolkien purists, you'll find more changes from the book in this film than in the Fellowship of the Ring. It is for you to argue among yourselves whether or not the changes were good. Most, in my opinion, were for setup purposes for the final film. However, the middle section of the movie is likely to be the most controversial. It apparently is taken from an appendix Tolkien wrote concerning Aragorn and Arwen. I am unsure of an event in the middle of this film involving Aragorn especially. It might also be a part of the appendix. If not, it is most certainly a large liberty to take with Tolkien's story and I'm sure many who love the books will be scratching their heads here. This added segment is at least twenty to thirty minutes in length. This may seem inconsequential, however, when you realize that the film is ending long before the final chapter of Two Towers arrives, you may be asking why Peter Jackson decided add this segment when it cost him a more breathtaking and pivotal sequence later. <br />Some other unexpected changes include an early visit to Gondor (which is most likely intended to set the scene for the next film) and the omission of much of the visit with Treebeard. The Ent sequence will likely be another topic of discussion, as some of the effects looked very unrealistic here compared with the cinematic glory of the rest of the film. Several scenes using a blue screen behind Merry and Pippin revert to the incredibly fake blue screen shots of the 50's and 60's. These two talented actors are also given very little to do and their pleasant banter is sorely missed. This however, does not differ too much from the book. What was a greater dissappointment to myself was the absence of the continual banter between Sam and Smeagol that made me laugh out loud while reading the book. We only get a glimmer of the extreme tension between the two in this film. The Director can hardly be criticized for this however, when you realize that to include everything would have created a six hour film, rather than three. <br />Gimli proves to be the comic relief in this film and his growing friendship and bond with Legolas is evident. Orlando Bloom once again plays Legolas with the unblinking (and I mean the guy never blinks!) intensity we've come to expect. Much focus is place on Aragorn and the films center has shifted a great deal. Aragorn is becoming a more central part of the story, and previous big players are standing more in the background. The most noticible step back is by Gandalf. However, he literally shines in every moment he is given and no one could argue that few characters have been given such a grand entrance in decades. New characters that I'm anxious to see much more of are the King of Rohan and his lovely daughter Eowyn. Eowyn's character is mesmerizing and Miranda Otto plays her with an amazing grace. Wormtongue, is as unlikeable and despicable as he should be.<br />You will find that despite the heart thumping battle scenes that take your breath away, the Two Towers also is also surprisinglytouching - a combination that few fantasy films have perfected or even attempted. Expect your emotions to run the gammet here. Peter Jackson, master cinematic chef that he is, has cooked up a masterpiece and in spite of a few minor changes in the recipe, The Two Towers will leave you with nothing but a delicious taste of Tolkien.
B00001X590|5.0|One of the best rock records of the 60s...or any decade actually. A &quot;must&quot; have...
B00005YXZH|5.0|A great record that takes more than one listen. Wonderfully mixed &amp; produced. Song writing and musicianship is as stellar as you'd expect from America's greatest working rock band. If you like Tom Petty, The Beatles, or REM check it out.
B00005JKZT|5.0|I thought it was a very good follow up to Fellowship of the Ring. Great effects, great score, great characters, and one of the most exciting hours at the end including a truly mind blowing battle.  My only problem with it is that I didn't think the pacing was all that good.  Where as Fellowship was 2 and 1/2+ hours and seemed like an hour and half or so to me (being so enthralled), The Two Towers, bein ga 3 hour movie, really did seem like one.  Too many ups and downs and flashback scenes of aragon and Arwen that I really just didn't find all that interesting.  I'm not sure why, but I really don't like how the love relationship is handled.  Anyway, its a worthy chapter in the Trilogy and I recommend it immensely.<br />On a side note I hope they make The Hobbit.  I Think it will definitely be made after the success Fellowship had and the success that TTT and Return of the King are bound to have.  I do think it is a better movie to do later though because the dragon is really going to be a hard CG character to make look real.  I had just recently saw Reign of Fire and I thought they did a decent job on it considering they only had a mid-level budget.  Jackson has 100 million for each of these movies and with success only comes bigger budgets so if they do make the Hobbit the dragon should be really amazing.  Thanks for reading. ;)
B00005JLF5|4.0|Well what can I say...this is by far the best series in my opinion.  Though it is closely followed by Next Generation.  Why is it the best?  Because every other Star Trek is about one ship out on its own, DS9 has so much more to it, its whats really going on in the federation.  The episodes are much more varyed than any of the other shows because of the influx of characters at the station and on the planet Beyshor.  We much more fequentlly visit the other races home worlds' giving us a better insight into how each one really is what it is.  And the Dominion Wars produced the best ship battles ever seen, over all the other series and the feature films.  The Defiant, perhaps the best ship name since Enterprise.  Lets not forget how much of a badass Sisko is.<br />The only reason I gave a rating of 4 instead of 5 is because the first season in any long running series is a little slow to get going.  But once all the main characters are exposed and we get to know them all... the following seasons just rock!  And it would have been nice if the Star Trek series were available in Letter-box format.
B000002UAI|4.0|This is a record that has very primitive production techniques, but it has some classic songs.  This record shows some maturity in Lennon &amp; McCartney's songwriting.  This is where Lennon first displays his self-depricating lyrics.  &quot;I don't want to spoil the party&quot; is a beautiful song, with soulful lyrics and some nice harmonies.   &quot;Every little thing&quot; is a very beautiful melody with some sincere vocals.  Even &quot;Baby's in Black&quot; has a nice middle-8 that is a classic example of Lennon/McCartney harmonizing.  Most of the covers are just throw-aways, and &quot;Mr Moonlight&quot; is just AWFUL.
B00000K0DK|5.0|Everything seems confused and absurd throughout the whole movie. Yet it's all brilliantly explained in the last ten seconds and the mystery is solved. The power of the movie is unparallel to anything I saw. It tells a story about a newspaper titan but the moral can be applied to anyone: You can never know what really goes on inside a human mind and happiness may come from something completely different than people think.<br />Definitely worth seeing.
B00005JKZT|4.0|I should probably be giving this movie five stars but my actual honest opinion is that it's a 4 and 1/2 star movie, and only because it strays from the book a lot more than Fellowship did. While Fellowship may have left out Tom Bobmabadle and other things there wasn't a lot of material added to the movie that wasn't at least implied in the books (IE the relationship between Aragorn and Arwin). However, this movie ads much to the story that wasn't in the book The Two Towers, and while some of it works, like the elves coming to aid against the Oruki, other parts had me a little frustrated. Faramir was not given the chance to be the good man that he was in the books, and came off as being a real jerk right up until the end. I didn't feel the desperation from Faramir that I felt from Boromir in the Fellowship of the Ring, and I didn't feel for him the way I did in the book, but then a lot of things happen in the book that it seems that they are holding for the third movie. I don't recall Faramir taking Frodo, Sam, and Gollum to Gondor in the book either.<br /> Despite these additions, and some occasionally poor CGI effects the movie still managed to hold me in awe throughout the entire 179 minutes. Most of the film is simply breathtaking, even though there are moments where some of the CGI creatures were not very convincing.<br /> On the other hand there's Gollum who put Yoda to shame. Yoda da man? I think not. Gollum! Gollum! To be honest I have a very well trained eye, and CGI effects do not convince me very often, but Gollum fooled my eyes! He looked so real, right down to the pours in his skin, convincing animation, facial expressions... and this boy delivered the most amazing performance of the movie, dealing out a dual personality, and moving the way he did... I'm impressed. Without a doubt Gollum is the best looking CGI character ever... on the other hand I felt that the Ents could have looked more realistic, and on occasion you run into those CGI wolves that the orcs were riding that were not as well done as they could have been either... but then again I know how difficult it is to have hundreds of thousands of photo realistic characters on screen at once.<br /> Over all I loved this movie, but I think that some aspects could have been better. I was upset to see it stray so much from the book, and yet it was still an epic of massive proportions. Still true, in spirit at least to the tone of the novel, if only in spirit. While Fellowship is the better of the two films so far I view the Two Towers as a bridge between to huge points, as with any trilogy the middle chapter is the thinnest, as far as plot and character development, and while this still has plenty of plot and character it is still thinner than the Fellowship, and I'm expecting the Return of the King to be the biggest of all, especially since so much that happened at the end of the Two Towers novel did NOT happen in the movie... but with the cliffhanger ending the movie had, one has to believe that Peter Jackson is just saving some of those big moments for the last movie.rcs were riding that were not as well done as they could have been either... but then again I know how difficult it is to have hundreds of thousands of photo realistic characters on screen at once. <BR> Over all I loved this movie, but I think that some aspects could have been better.

B0000027RL|4.0|I like Ten over Nevermind because Nirvana were walking the sellout route in 1991. But later kept it real the next year though. But although this album is labeled one of the nest pop albums. It isnt as popish as Nevermind were. You understood the lyrics and the ORIGINAL riffs courtesy of Mr.Gossard and the deep vocals of Mr.Vedder and who can forget the hauting bass of Jeff Ament. While Nevermind was basically Kurt Cobain screaming over pop tunes.<br />No I'm saying Pearl Jam is or was the better of Grunge bands, because Nirvana made Grunge the biggest part of music. But this album is alot better than Nevermind. But Nirvana's In Utero supasses PJ's follow-up VS.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina's voice is simply amazing. Stripped is a testament of both her youth and her amazing transformation into a woman, who will transcend time. There is no comparison between Christina and other young talents. She is a young Whitney Houston. When I first heard Christina several years ago on the Mulan sound track, I told everyone about Reflections and how this girl was going to be untouchable in the right hands. It appears she landed in those hands with Stripped. You get such a diverse Christina, she's soul (9-Impossible, 10-Underappreciated), she's rock (12-Make Over), she's hip-hop (16-Dirrty), she's Latin (6-Infatuation), she is a true talent (11-Beautiful,18-The Voice Within).

B00006YXEK|4.0|Don't get me wrong, I'm a big George Harrison fan.  And I'm happy to report that this isn't some scam-a-buck, posthumous mishmash.  George went into the studio not long before his death and recorded these tracks.  Son Dhani and Jeff Lynne performed mixing and mastering duties in the studio after his passing.<br />But, come on: this is ELO.  Harrison adopted this sound with Lynne during the Traveling Wilburys, rode it through 'Cloud Nine,' got Lynne to provide similar ELO-ish overtones to Beatles Anthology tracks 'Free as a Bird,' and 'Real Love.'<br />The *real* George surfaced on the 30th anniversary re-release of 'All Things Must Pass,' with his courageous re-staging of 'My Sweet Lord' and a drop-dead stunner of a re-mix of an acoustic version of 'Let It Down.'  In fact, just listen to that one song to hear how great a stripped down Harrison sounds and how wise and restrained his instincts are on the tasteful overdubbings done 28+ years later.<br />In contrast, the only song that stands out here is the one *not touched* by Lynne:  \\"Devil and the Deep Blue Sea.\\"  Harrison was mad for the ukeleke, and this song - recorded with Jools Holland - reflects that passion.  Now, *that's* the album we need to see.<br />I should add that I like ELO.  It's just that I really wanted the unfettered George here.

B00005JKZT|5.0|Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is the second part of the trilogy, which is a a superb transition between the The Fellowship of the Rings and the future The Return of the King.  The begining is rather fragmented and it resembles the moment of losing hope that the broken fellowship is sensing.  Frodo is off on his quest with Sam trying to find a way into Mordor to destroy the ring while they are being stalked by Gollum.  In a different direction, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli are trying to hunt down the uruk-hai and orcs that have kidnapped Merry and Pippen.  Meanwhile, Saruman is sending troops into Rohan and someone is clouding the thoughts of Rohan's King.  Many different subplots emerge and they all seem to lead towards one common threat, the evil within Mordor.  The Two Towers deals with many different issues such as immorality, love, compassion, hope, and many more in a very real manner while the looming war is drawing nearer.
B0000256VK|5.0|This is without question the greatest album for making love.  The only albums I would place anywhere near it are The Beatles Abbey Road and T. Rex Electric Warrior, only the former is for romance and the latter is for making out.  Avalon is for making love.
B000001ELP|3.0|...and this was clearly that. I can definitely appreciate it, but can you imagine what it must have been like for those fans back in 1981 and listening to \\"Just a Boy\\" for the first time? I'm still chuckling. Also the fact that this is Eric Carr's first album which, as later albums would prove, clearly does not show his potential. Even in Ace's \\"Darklight\\" he sings as if he wanted to be anywhere else, and every fan knows what happened after this album. However, there are some good tunes. \\"Fanfare\\" and the much departed \\"World Without Heroes\\" are nice, but they save the best for last in \\"I\\". Arguably one of the best songs in their arsenal, it is a hint of what to expect in future albums, such as Creatures and Lick it Up. It's an anthem rocker that seems to say \\"we are young, free and happy, come and join us\\" and no band has ever said this better. For fans I say, yes buy this one and keep the perspective of younger days when you thought a mullet looked cool. For first timers please buy Alive, Destroyer or Dressed to Kill first and then come back to this one.
B000066NW0|5.0|I have had this CD for mnths now, in fact, I think I got it the day it was released.  The point is I still love it.  I am very impressed with her talent.  It is definitely one of those CD's that will transcend into time.  Avril is an amazing new talent.  She wrote all the songs on this album &amp; it amazes me how mature the lyrics are for such a young chick.  I am a 32 yr. old music fan &amp; I find it refreshing that there are so many of these young talented singer/songwriters that have recently been introduced into the music industry.  Avril has so much talent &amp; I am sure she will be around for a long long time.  Already over 4 mill sold in 7 mnths, way to go &amp; what an accomplishment for a young lady.

B000005H3M|5.0|This album is one of the best Buddy Rich albums ever, and you can believe me. I own 17 of Buddy's albums to back that up!
B00005AQE8|5.0|Wow!  I'm surprised that there are people who don't think this is one of the greatest rap albums to date.  Sure there are other records that are of equal magnitude.  Snoop Dogg, Warren G, Dre, Eminem, etc. have all come out with killer albums, but this album is no worse than any of those.  As one of the original founders of modern day rap, 2 pac's legacy is still very much alive.  I respect the opinions of others, but the true success of this album definitely speaks for itself.  I would recommend this album to anyone interested in knowing the greatness of 2 pac.  May 2 pac's greatness survive the test of time!!
B00005JKZT|4.0|While the title of this film should be called \\"The Showdown at Helms Deep,\\" instead of \\"The Two Towers,\\" this next installment of The Lord of the Rings is nevertheless very impressive. While being a bit different compared to the novel, director, Peter Jackson weaves a timeless film about adventure, love and valor. The die-hard fans of the book would disagree with the filmmakers' choice of reinterpreting the sequence of events.<br />The most interesting character by far is Gollum, the dual personality CGI creature. While have a voice similar to Jar-Jar Binks. Gollum is a far more complex character, even more so than some of human ones. The battle at Helms Deep is definitely the climax of the movie and is one of the most impressive battle scenes ever committed to film.<br />There are only two gripes I had with the film. The first problem I had was the unnecessary insertion of a female presence, especially Cate Blanchett's character, Galadriel. The next is the Ents. Although I understand that it is extremely difficult to create these tree-like characters for the screen, without them looking like outtakes from the Wizard of Oz, they still looked pretty bad. Overall, being a 3-hour epic, this film is very fun to watch and is an incredible feat of the imagination.
B00005JKZT|5.0|Okay, after a year of anticipation, I eagerly went to this movie on opening day. I can almost guarantee you will LOVE this movie, as long as you understand that:<br />1. Nothing can compare to the experience in the first movie where you saw all the characters for the first time and fell in love with them.<br />and <br />2. This film is a bridge film, and as such doesn't really have a beginning or even remotely an ending<br />and <br />3. According to the director of the three films, this one detracts from the book the most, and does so for many reasons including pacing, time restrictions and to a lesser extent, simplification of the complicated structure in the Two Towers book.<br />as long as you go knowing these three things, you will be blown away by this film. Even if you don't, you will only be slightly less so.<br />Now, for some details. Stop reading here if you want to avoid MINOR SPOILERS.<br />First off, the movie picks up with Gandalf fighting the Balrog. Then joins Frodo and Sam in the wastes, where they are lost. There is no prologue to catch you up, so you must see the first movie if you want to understand this one.<br />The main piece of the film deals with Rohan, which is being invaded by Sauraman's army. Theoden, their king, is hopelessly caught in a spell, and being manipulated by his advisor Grima, who is actually an agent of Sauraman's. When Gandalf returns and frees him, he realizes that they are in great peril, and orders everyone to Helm's Deep. Here, a heartwrenching last stand takes place, where even the older male children of Rohan are given swords and join in the fight. <br />The second major story line follows Frodo and Sam, who meet up with Gollum, who is portrayed wonderfully by Andy Serkis. Gollum is truly a piteous creature, and struggles between wanting to redeem himself and his lust for the ring. Frodo and Sam also meet up with Faramir (Boromir's brother), and fans of the books may object to the way Faramir is portrayed. Faramir also desires to take the ring to Gondor, but changes his mind when he sees the power of the ring at work. In the book, Faramir struggled with what to do with Frodo, but not to the extent he does in the film.<br />Finally, Merry and Pippin end up with Treebeard, a creature called an Ent. Ents take care of the trees, and are very tree-like themselves. The Ents are magnificently done, and the only disappointment is that we don't see more of them. However, they should appear for a little while in the third movie.<br />While this film doesn't have as many poignant moments as the first, there are several heartwarming scenes. Sam will continue to be the poster child for loyalty, and will move you to tears at the end.<br />If you liked the fellowship, go to this movie. You won't regret it.  However, and this is important, SEE IT TWICE at least.  This film is very different than the first, and there is a lot to catch.  It is comparable to another bridge film, the Empire Strikes Back, which was my least favorite of the original 3 Star Wars movies when I first saw, but is now considered by myself and many others to be the best one.
0446677450|4.0|This is a great look at how we should teach our kids about money. We grew up with depression age parents who were always worried about every penny, but did not always save and invest. I would like to recommend another book. The Intersection of Joy and MOney. The author brings you right to the core of why you have problems with money and that these issues began in childhood. Get the Intersection book and resolve your money issues before you pass them to your kids.
B00005JKZT|5.0|Be forewarned that there are no catching up for the first opening scene jumps straight to Gandalf the Grey (Ian McKellen) engaged in a fierce tussle with the Balrog after plunging from a vertiginous cliff. The 3-hour long epic continues the saga from where The Fellowship of The Ring left off in the literary fantasy gem by J.R.R Tolkien; the second in the trilogy. <br />And this movie succeeds the predecessor in every manner under Peter Jackson's direction to become a magnum opus of tremendous power, visual splendor and emotional core that will make Tolkien proud. Every moment in this majestic adventure sweeps you with its elegiac tone and dark suspense with the judicious use of astonishing CGI effects that you never thought could materialize in such supremacy. <br />The fantasy tells of the journey hobbit Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) embarks to destroy The One Ring that tempts humanity into evil and Frodo becomes increasingly powerless to the attraction. Sam Gamgee (Sean Astin) is his sole companion as the rest of his motley gang is separated. Merry (Dominic Monaghen) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) captured by the Orcs, harrowingly escapes to Fangorn Forest. Aragon (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas Greenleaf (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli the dwarf (John Rhys-Davies) pursues relentlessly for the missing two and arrives at Rohan. <br />It is amazing how these three paths interweaves with its own clarity to pave the road to the showdown at Helm's Deep where the people of Rohan under the rule of King Theoden (Bernard Hill) and niece Eowyn  (Miranda Otto) battles against the 10,000 strong Uruk Hai cavalry. The Dark Lord Sauron has aligned forces with Saruman the White (Christopher Lee) to wipe out mankind and it is up to Aragon to bind Rohan and Gandor against the dark forces. <br />The Two Towers is a full-fledged action adventure but also a deeply moving tale of freedom, massacre and enslavement. Peter Jackson's bold cinematic angles and close-ups effectively conveys personal intimacy and emotions besides the grandeur. In an unprecedented revolutionizing move, he employs evocative complexed digital creatures such as Gollum the elfin and Ents the ancient talking trees to relay subtly the devastating psychological effects of evil and ecological messages respectively. <br />His ambitious work shot over 2 years in New Zealand and a bloating budget of 310 million has being rewarded fruitfully with increasing followers who are being enchanted by his interpretation of Middle Earth with lush greenery and rolling mountains as well as shadowly swamps that makes the period convincingly real. The gorgeous cinematography has replaced the explanation of the plot that hindered the first episode. <br />It is no longer a tale of the conventional struggle between evil and good but also one of fraternity and gives one the conviction of the heroes's affirmation and belief. It is touchingly poignant as the allegory gains currency in the modern zeigeist of terrorism and defies categorization. Constantly riveting and exhilarating, Jackson's passion for the sprawling saga has turned it into a fragile objet d' art and a revolutionizing piece of epic work, accomplished in every sense.
0060526491|5.0|The book isn't near thick enough for me, for I laughed out loud and wanted to continue turning the pages to yet another bolt of humor... the drawings are great. Sweet yet sick in a happy kind of way. Thank you Tim Burton for helping me keep my brain wide open and childlike in my creative thinking! I have purchased 3 Oyster Boy books for Christmas presents.
067101756X|2.0|&quot;The Day After Roswell&quot; by Philip Corso is either one of the most significant books of the 20th century or a complete waste of time. Corso, a former high-ranking military officer, claims that he spearheaded the government's supersecret effort to analyze the wreckage of an alien spacecraft and apply the extraterrestrial technology to US industry. Among other items, fiber optics and integrated circuit chips are allegedly the fruits of Corso's efforts. Corso's account is meticulous but leaves many questions unanswered. The author verifies the existence of the infamous, oft-doubted MJ-12 working group and offers the possibility that the &quot;aliens&quot; found at Roswell were in fact time travelers from Earth's own future, raising some bizarre questions: if the &quot;aliens&quot; came to 1947 using technology which we in turn injected into contemporary industry, then where--or, more accurately, when--did the technology come from in the first place?
B000003Z4C|5.0|Its been a little more than two years since I was first introduced to the music of Nick Cave, and in that time I have acquired all of his CDs and have had the pleasure of seeing him in concert. Now that I have had time to listen many times to all of his work, I have settled on Let Love In as one of his best.<br />Particularly interesting is the juxtaposition of the two versions of \\"Do You Love Me?\\" which serve as the bread in this dark and chilling musical sandwich. The jaunty first version is filled with violent passion while the slow-paced second version is a macabre and profoundly disturbing tale of predatory pedophilia and torture. After long study of the lyrics, I have come to the conclusion that it may even reference a snuff film. Both are tremendous songs, filled with raw emotional power.<br />Other top-notch songs include the lusty Loverman, the sinister Red Right Hand, the drunken apologia of the Thirsty Dog, the somber Ain't Gonna Rain Anymore and the egoistic Lay Me Low. But the tour de force is I Let Love In, the plaintive lyrics of which ring with truth for millions. As usual, the Bad Seeds masterfully set the proper mood on each of these fine Cave compositions.<br />The only song I really don't care for is Jangling Jack. The lyrics are amusing, but the delivery is just too dissonant. It jangles the nerves and I often skip past it.<br />If you don't yet know the music of Nick Cave, Let Love In is the perfect CD to begin with. If you do know Cave but don't yet have this, you should order it without delay. It receives my highest recommendation.
B000066NW0|2.0|Sometimes I say to myself- &quot;what do people see in that Avri Lavigne chick?&quot; Is there something to her personality that I'm supposed to like?<br />Pre-programmed MTV puppets ARE a dime a dozen, but that's not my issue with her. My issue is she portrays &quot;punk society&quot; and sings pop music. Breaking the barricades? No. A punk would never be caught singing something as dull as &quot;Nobody's Fool.&quot; While I recognize Lavigne's desire to be her own person through expression of clothes and music- like any other teenager -I can't respect her insistence that she's genuine when she plays to her fans, becoming something she thinks they want her to be.. whatever that is at the moment.<br />She does have her promise as a pop musician. I can't write anything as worthwhile as &quot;Anything But Ordinary,&quot; but I think she needs some time to mature and find herself in the industry and the world. And besides &quot;Complicated,&quot; &quot;Naked,&quot; and &quot;Anything but ordinary,&quot; there's not much on here worthwhile. Her words are dull, her voice is whiny at times and her instrumentals need some serious work, for the most part. Her attempts at real punk -&quot;Losing Grip&quot; and &quot;Mobile&quot;- are worth mentioning, but wouldn't stand out on a rock station, except for their lack of true rock drive.<br />The CD is worse than average because besides the three tracks I mentioned, nothing on it is innovative or that clever. And while she may honestly be expressing herself, I found myself easily distracted from the CD over and over. Meaning? I didn't think it's not as captivating as everyone seems to think.<br />In time, Avril could be a notable talent. As it stands, I think she has a lot of growing up to do.
B0000584TI|5.0|The primary purpose for paying more for a Japanese import is to enjoy it's superior sound. Particularily, when the music demands it, as is the case with 'Octopus'.... an understated masterpiece of sorts. Having just auditioned this disc only last evening I am very happy to report that my money has been well spent. The sonics here are a pleasure to listen to. The sound does justice to the often brilliant interplay of the instuments and vocals leaving one with a very satisfying listening experience.<br />Fork out the extra funds and experience this fine work as it should be experienced.
0385474547|5.0|A read this book as it was cited as one of the 100 greatest books of all time by a group of Scandinavian Scholars. I usually do not like reading books in translation and, in the beginning; I felt I would surely be disappointed. The language is simple (more complex language is sometimes misspelled in this text-- I found a few mistakes)... but as the story progresses, the characters gain dimension. Until the last two pages I felt the work was solid. Then comes the end. Powerful when put in perspective... akin to the end of 'Grapes of Wrath.' Another word of advice, don't read the commentary on the back flap of the book... I had a hard time believing that whoever wrote it and I read the same book...
B00005JKZT|5.0|I had the pleasure of watching the Two Towers last night with my family and a sold out auditorium.  We were not disappointed.<br />I will try to convey a little of the excitement surrounding this film without giving away spoilers - the film's own trailor gives away FAR too much already, in my opinion.<br />The thrill that pulsed through the theater audience as various characters made their screen appearance was palpable.  Much has been made of Viggo Mortenson's Aragorn, Andy Serkis' remarkable portrayal of Gollum/Smeagol, Ian McKellen's startling transformation from certain death as Gandalph the Grey to return as Gandalph the White, and the incredible staging of the Battle of Helm's Deep.<br />What I had not expected was the power of the individual characters of John Rhys-Davies as Gimli and Orlando Bloom as Legolas.  Gimli is given most of the lighter, more humorous moments - but he also proves at Helm's Deep to be a greater warrior than his Dwarvish size would suggest.  When Orlando Bloom's Legolas first strolls across the screen in the opening moments of the film I could hear the sounds of swooning women all around me.  And Legolas' character displays some of the film's finer and noblest moments, in particular scenes with Aragorn.  At Helm's Deep let's just say you would not want to be an enemy of Legolas - in his fighting scenes he is not only a prolific dispatcher of the enemy, but also marvelously graceful.<br />The special effects fill the screen, but do not dominate the story.  This story contained within this film does not stand on it's own - it requires the volumes before and after.  But this is true of Tolkien's original work as well - Lord of the Rings is meant to be taken as a whole, broken into three \\"smaller\\" pieces for ease of digestion.<br />What \\"middle\\" part of a film trilogy can compare?  Godfather II?  The Empire Strikes Back?  This film stands in very high company.<br />Lord, let me live long enough to see \\"Return of the King\\".<br />Bravo, Peter Jackson, crew and cast.  Bravo.er Jackson, crew and cast.  Bravo.
B00005V3Z4|4.0|This an utterly fascinating and profoundly unsettling film.  It is also thoroughly nihilistic in the most exacting sense.  It is an impressive work, but it has contracted the disease that it so powerfully analyzes (in the same way \\"Ghost World\\" and \\"Happiness\\" do).  It is tainted at the root with a will to nothingness--a desire literally realized in the film's ending through the metaphor of time travel.  This is a must-see film but should be treated with care.  Wear a clean-suit to avoid contamination.  And above all, purify yourself by following it with a viewing of the (unofficial) source material: 1989's \\"Heathers.\\"  The authentic humor, generosity of spirit, and critical intelligence that undermines the dark overtones of that classic 89 film is a wonderful counterpoint and antidote to the diseased spirit that became creative in Donnie Darko.

One day, he met Jamie Sullivan; a girl so full of sweetness and charisma. All the other kids at school made a spectacle of her b/c she sat by herself at lunch reading the bible. Unlike his friends, Landon took the chance to see her for what she really was. Soon enough, they both fell for eachother. Their love defied gravity. This is definitley a novel to remember.

0385484518|5.0|I read this book because I was looking for grief books and the bookstore salesperson pointed it out as a  good book. I read the book, not as a manual on dealing with death, but as an interesting story of friends and their impending loss.<BR> I found that Mitch picked up on some interesting points as well as some minor ones that many of us would miss. Mitch kept bringing Morrie food even when Morrie wasn't eating much. We all try to continue to act how we wish it would be or hoped it could be. We try to make things remain as normal as possible and it is hard to adjust to the change especially when we know we are going to lose someone.<BR> Pick this book up because it is a good read. <BR>I also would recommend, Healing Stories of Grief and Faith, From Denial and Despair to Comfort and Peace to those experiencing grief.

0451204530|4.0|I don't share the sentiments of those who did not like this book. It was given to me for Christmas a year ago and I regret not having picked it up sooner to read through it. The central character wakes up in Washington's Union Station with what he thinks is a bad hangover, dressed like a bum and not knowing who he is. After many chapters, that issue is solved only to open up other questions, most notably why has someone tried to erase his memory? He is able to piece together that he is a rocket scientist associated with the Explorer I launch, that he has an OSS background, and that he came to Washington because of concerns he had about the integrity of the Explorer program. Someone didn't want him revealing what he knew, but who and why?<BR>The answers to those questions come in an interesting way and as they are revealed, his life is put in considerable danger as is the safety of the Explorer I launch. I have enjoyed most, but not all of Mr. Follett's books, but this one is a clear winner.

With the 'mad scientist' and the giant tarantula and all, what more could you want in a plot.  So what if the big spider looks fake sometime and the acting is not Harrison Ford.  It is still a fun monster movie and I love watching it.  I am on my third copy of this one and watch it often enough that I will have to have another one soon.
B000002LFU|3.0|I can see how so many people love \\"Green\\" (and, to be honest, my actual opinion is 3 1/2 stars for this one). It has many moments of luminous atmosphere and swimming melodies. But, I have to say I think this is R.E.M.'s weakest effort (\\"Monster\\" has always been terribly underrated). Of course, there is no \\"bad\\" R.E.M. album-their worst can usually stand in for any other band's best-there are just \\"lesser\\" R.E.M. albums. And \\"Green\\" is lesser than \\"Automatic for the People\\", \\"Murmur\\", \\"Out of Time\\", and \\"Document\\". Many of its songs, especially the wandering \\"The Wrong Child\\", just go around and around and don't end up anywhere (think \\"Drive\\" only times 10). This album is a strange anomaly in that the big popular songs on it are probably the best parts, not usually the case on a work from R.E.M. \\"Pop Song 89\\" is a friendly, opening gesture with a great chorus and continues R.E.M.'s awesome ability to open up their albums well. \\"Stand\\" always brings a smile to my face, despite its simpleness (this is where the \\"going 'round and 'round\\" method works). And the music video is great too. \\"Orange Crush\\" is one of the best songs R.E.M. has ever written, period. Of the non-hits, \\"Hairshirt\\" and \\"World Leader Pretend\\" are the strongest. \\"Hairshirt\\" is a melancholy and beautiful ballad with a heartfelt tinge of regret and pathos-and that's a lot to say about a song about a dog (I think it's about a dog at least). \\"World Leader Pretend\\" is actually the best song on the album and probably in the band's personal top 10. Centering around a powerful (and possibly corrupt) leader who is aware of his shortcomings and imminent downfall, \\"World Leader\\" is one of the most mature and elegiac songs on any R.E.M. album. So, there are more ups than downs on this one, but overall the impact isn't as great as some of their other works. Pick up \\"Automatic\\", or \\"Murmur\\", or \\"Out of\\", or \\"Document\\", or \\"Reckoning\\", or any of this band's other masterpieces before going out for \\"Green\\".
B00006NSZ5|5.0|Yeah, I know Eminem is on this cd and his contributions are dope,  of course everyone's heard \\"Lose Yourself,\\" but check his verse on \\"Love Me\\" with Obie Trice and the star of the soundtrack 50 Cent. 50 Cent's \\"Wanksta\\" is one of the best songs in hip-hop this year, plus it's a diss song about Ja Rule (check the doll in video wearing Ja's guitar charm on his chain) how can you go wrong. 50's other solo song \\"Places to Go\\" has him spittin fire over a bangin Eminem back drop. Jay-Z slides into the mix flanked by his soldier Freeway on the solemn \\"8 Miles and Runnin,\\" I dare you to listen to this song and not have the hook stuck in your head. Other hot ones include Rakim's sonic boom \\"R.A.K.I.M,\\" Obie Trice's \\"Adrenaline Rush\\" and D-12's \\"Rap Game,\\" another bangin hook by 50 on that one. There are only three missteps on the soundtrack, Macy Gray's annoying \\"Time of Your Life,\\" Xzibit's below average \\"Spit Shine,\\" and Nas' latest Jay-Z diss, \\"You Wanna Be Me.\\" Other than these slip ups, 8 Mile is one of the best hip-hop soundtracks since \\"The Show.\\"
B000068IEU|3.0|I was disappointed with this '70's era explotation film.  While it has some grusome scenes of disembowelments etc., it fell far short of the sexual tension necessary to rate 5 stars from me. I only gave it 3 stars (as opposed to 1) because it did have some minor sexual situations that would not be found in films made today.  I think if its bloody violent scenes you are looking for, purchase \\"Ilsa, The She Wolf of the SS\\".  It has lots of bloody torture scenes, but also lacks in the sexual arena as well.  All in all, I wish I could get my money back on this film.
B00006LIRI|3.0|First of all, the &quot;New Mixes&quot; of the songs from 'Pop' (&quot;Discotheque&quot;, &quot;Staring at the Sun&quot;, and &quot;Gone&quot;) are inferior to the originals.  So to is the William Orbit Mix of &quot;Electrical Storm&quot; (the original is on the Limited Edition bonus disk and Part 2 cd-single).<br />Second, there are a few essentials missing - namely:<BR>1. &quot;The Fly&quot; (the introductory single to U2's reinvention in the 1990s);<BR>2. &quot;Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses&quot; [Temple Bar Remix] (the popular and more acoustic version than the version on 'Achtung Baby');<BR>3. &quot;Lemon&quot; (one of their most experimental singles and videos in a decade of experimentation);<BR>4. &quot;Please&quot; (simply one of their most underrated songs);<BR>5. &quot;If God Would Send His Angels&quot; (another popular remix from the immensly popular 'City of Angels' soundtrack)<br />Others have pointed out the omissions of &quot;Walk On&quot; and &quot;Elevation&quot;, the Grammy-winning singles from the Grammy-winning last LP, 'All That You Can't Leave Behind' (2000).  This is also a fair criticism.  One reason for their omission might be the fact that they were released as singles in 2001 (but then again, so was &quot;Stuck in a Moment&quot;).  The other, perhaps more practical, reason may lie in the fact that U2 has a three-compilation deal with their old label, Island, and the last LP was done with their new label, Interscope, the latter of which does not want to spoil the current sales of their last record by including too much on this compilation.  Whatever the reason, these tunes will probably show up on 'The Best of 2000-2010' a decade from now.<br />And then there are few songs, for the sake of consistency with U2's first compilation 'The Best of 1980-1990' (a collection of great singles), that should not be on here:<BR>1. &quot;Until the End of the World&quot; (a great song and staple of their live set for years, but then again, so is &quot;Bullet the Blue Sky&quot; which was not included on the first compilation);<BR>2. &quot;Gone&quot; (ditto);<BR>3. &quot;The First Time&quot; (ditto - except this one is not even performed live); and<BR>4. &quot;The Hands That Built America&quot; (Bono's pseudo-opera sounding vocal part is just awful and the out-of-context 9/11 reference at the end is just predictable)<br />If you want a really complete collection, I highly recommend the DVD version of 'The Best of 1990-2000', complete with almost all versions of their 1990s videos with commentary (in most cases) and a few added bonuses.
B000002KY8|5.0|I Love This album. This was Prince breakthrough on the Pop charts and what an album it was. 70 minute of great pop rock music that is among the best LPs of all time. It has the kick ... tracks Delirious, 1999 and the classic Little Red Corvette among Lady Cab Driver and many more. This album ranks as one of Prince classics and no wonder.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I did not expect much from this album.  She has an amazing voice and I figured that based on what seems to be the pop album recipe these days, there would be 2 or 3 good songs and the rest would be fairly poor.  I was very surprised to find that I really enjoy the entire album and have voluntarily recommended it to many friends.  Her voice is absolutely amazing, of course, but not overdone in the Whitney Houston/Mariah Carey way.  The variety and quality of songs are impressive, featuring jazz, gospel and rock influences as well as thoughtful lyrics throughout.  I haven't taken it out of my cd player in two weeks and am now wondering if she might end up being a true lasting artist rather than a flash-in-the-pan pop sensation.
B000002KLP|4.0|Princes third LP Dirty Mind is one of the best albums Ive heard that have come out in the early 80s. The sound is funky and lyrically it is one of the most sexual explicit albums I have ever heard. The music is really good and the songs are catchy. The LP is both raw yet funky and brilliant all at the same time his falsetto voice and carisma shines through his album. However many people have not heard of this album and I find its time to let them know that this album is not to be overlooked. Prince is a genius who has managed to make over 20 albums in 20 years. Almost every album is either good, great or a masterpiece ( Take that Michael Jackson). Buy it now. You wont regret it.
B00006X06U|5.0|I've read with amusement all of the reviews thus far and opinions therein.  The views seem to be polarized into the negative, (her voice has gone up in smoke, or she turned into Muzak, etc.)and the positive who see Travelogue as nothing short of a masterwork.  I fall into the latter.  Joni has shrewdly reminded this world that now worhips ten-minute talents, of the vast depth and enduring standards that her music has set for over thirty years.  And she has achieved this not by repackaging her catalog into a box set, like so many others, but by breathing a new light into it. And what a light it is. A light of time and space and experience and life.  The orchestration of Joni Mitchell's music allows all of this to happen and it happens beautifully.  How many of her contemporaries could pull this off?  I can't think of anyone.  It is a unconventional approach, but anyone who has followed Joni, this is nothing new.  Joni has always been unconventional (think Hissing of Summer Lawns or Hejira).  Listening to Travelogue (very aptly titled), one is reminded at first of the originals, but over repeated listenings there is very little competition, as I believe both versions stand on their own which is further testament to the enduring standards that Joni Mitchell has set. Joni Mitchell has taken her music and placed it in a museum.  A museum that allows us to see where we've been, how far we've come, where we are, and how the world has changed.  But most importantly, we are in this museum that allows us to see and feel and realize her ART.  This is nothing short of a remarkable achievement.  Thank you Joni.
B00005YU1O|5.0|Speaking just to the &quot;story&quot;  and not the amazing animation, this movie is a 'dream come true' if you love to ponder life.  It is for the people who are always asking why and why not and it is not for the quesy or mundane.  It is like a great book that you have to read again and again (not for answers but for truth) and luckily the visual imagery and music of this film make it easy to do.  It is not for the faint heart but for those who could talk poetry and philosophy all night and only begin to feel at dawn that they had begun to talk.  If this is you... see this film.

6305165912|5.0|You're either going to love it or hate it!  <br />I won't even try to describe the plot, because its really not that important.  The movie is about a couple of incredibly funny characters brought to life by Jeff Bridges and John Goodman, and their love/hate relationship.  &quot;The Dude&quot;, played by Jeff Bridges rides an emotional rollercoaster of events, all brought about by a thug urinating on his rug in a case of mistaken identity.  Egged on by his friend Walter (John Goodman) the Dude tries to recover his rug, and becomes caught up in the middle of plot which is almost impossible to follow - but somehow that just doesn't matter.<br />This movie is full of good laughs of all kinds from start to finish.  The dialog, subtle gags, and ironic turns of events will have fans rolling (am I wrong?).  <br />Bridges and Goodman are PERFECT in their respective roles.  Watching the Dude's facial expressions alone is worth the cost of the movie, but it really offers so much more.  If you're one of the people who love it, you'll want to watch it over and over.<br />If you like the other works by the Coen brothers, this is a must have DVD.
B00004XONN|5.0|Following Radiohead from Pablo Honey to Kid A, it can be easy to say that Kid A, and later Amnesiac, was an easy way to avoid having to raise the standards once again. That is, after OK Computer. But that is purely shallow reasoning for these albums' appearance. <BR>While OK Computer has been called a great many things, including being one of the greatest albums ever, it was certainly a very good album that read like a James Joyce novel. With that, Kid A is a step further into an abyss that is very much our world today.<BR>Let me explain. Kid A can only be explained in reference to OK Computer, and for a great many reasons. Fitter, Happier from OK Computer can really serve as a thesis for the whole album. That's where Kid A takes off. I say that OK computer reads like a James Joyce novel because James Joyce used both classical and romantic techniques in his writing. This can be seen in the structured songs of OK Computer and on the latter, choppy lyrics, for example. This can be used to really describe OK Computer and like James Joyce, a pinnacle for both musical and literary works. <BR>But Kid A takes us even further. It's like reading something completely further in time. Like if Albert Camus were to write today. This can explain the lack of structure in the songs, wierd sounds out of tune horns and strings, and extremely choppy lyrics. <BR>Radiohead deserve five stars for this effort. Not only because of the depth of intellegence it holds, but because of it's ability to convey through music very, very effectively. That said,Treefingers isn't a boring song in the middle of the album, it's a calm counterpoint to the rest of the album's mess. This album along with Amnesiac were not experimental at all. They were all finely crafted to pick up where OK Computer left off.<BR>Radiohead have introduced another work of genius. Because to understand Kid A, you must first understand that behind all the pop culture and marketing fluff we are bombarded with everyday, Kid A relates to us what is really working behind our society. And it isn't a very pretty picture.
B00005KHJM|5.0|This is not a horror movie in the generally understood sense, but since it has Christopher Lee in it, I guess people expect that it will be. But be prepared for something more cerebral: the Wicker Man won't have you leaping behind the sofa (well, not out of fright, at any rate) but it will tax your sensibilities: a sense of dawning, slowly spreading dread will get under your skin. That's a far more difficult stunt for a director to pull off.<br />For all this sense of dread, the Wicker Man is a considered rumination on a clash of beliefs. Woodward, a man who throughout his acting career has managed to personify pompousness, is superbly cast as an out-and-out prude of a Christian policeman, lured from his beat on the conventional Scottish mainland to an isolated Scottish Isle to investigate an allegation of a missing person. The isle quickly reveals itself to be (in Sgt. Howie's view) a den of disgusting iniquity, its population given over to the practice of pagan rites in place of decent, traditional Christian Values. The epicentre of activity is the local pub, the Green Man.<br /><br />This is the first score the film makes: the Green Man is a figure from Celtic myth and the rituals and beliefs associated with it have been around, in the British Isles, longer than Christianity itself.<br /><br />And the pagans run rings around poor, starched Sgt. Howie. Howie fulminates, he fumes, and bridles beneath his policeman's uniform, of which he barely removes even his hat. The locals, by contrast, are quite happy to remove pretty much everything, indulging in sins of the flesh in nearly every direction that Howie can turn. Christopher Lee is marvellous as the gentrified spokesperson for this way of life. He remarks to Howie that he could live with the animals: \\"They do not lie awake in the dark and weep for their sins.\\" Howie, by contrast, postively revels in weeping for his, and those of the islanders.<br /><br />So scores point number two - Christians: who do you think you are, imposing your own subjective values on a bunch of people who, minding their own business, are getting on just fine, thank you very much? In the current global climate, this question has a real resonance.<br /><br />Screenplay writer Shaffer alludes to another ancient pagan mythology in developing this point: One night Howie is tempted, like Odysseus, by a singing siren in the form of Landlord's daughter Britt Ekland, knocking on the his wall and enticing him to sample her wares. By the skin of his teeth (and by dint of staying the other side of the wall) Howie maintains his Christian composure, though I daresay viewers will have trouble doing so: it is an extraordinarily erotic scene. But it is not gratuitous: in steadfastly refusing to give himself over to temptation, Howie unwittingly sets himself up for the awful resolution of the film.<br /><br />It is difficult to discuss much of the rest of the Wicker Man without giving the game away, and this rob the film of much of its impact. Suffice to say it's a truly startling, haunting finish, the final scene instilling real dread and horror not so much in Howie's own predicament (although this is surely dreadful enough), but the viewer's realisation (which Howie himself never makes) that his whole scheme of belief will not save him or in any way mitigate his own fate.<br /><br />Oddly this ending met with approval amongst church leaders, who pronounced the film profoundly christian in depicting Howie's heroic final stance. That's not how I saw it: to my eyes the entire film is an essay in the futility of Christian thought: as he rails impotently against the inevitable fate he has brought on himself, it is Howie himself who is the Wicker (i.e., straw) Man.<br /><br />And at his demise, the sun comes up on the isle, as if nothing had happened.<br /><br />Olly Buxtonbjective values on a bunch of people who, minding their own business, are getting on just fine, thank you very much?

0767805712|2.0|Granted, Gattaca certainly tries to be all things to all people - it sells itself variously as a Philip K. Dick-esque sci-fi, as a Tense Political Thriller, an Edgy Romance, even as a Rumination on Filial Love and Obligation - but in my book it fails badly on every count. I am clearly in the minority on this, so I had better explain.<br />From the opening sequence, something is clearly amiss: I mean, extreme close-ups of exfoliated skin and toenail clippings, anyone?<br />Thereafter, things do not improve.<br />First off, the sci-fi premise is flimsy (it's a rap on the genetically programmed to be perfect humans vs. \\"human\\" humans debate: where \\"human\\" humans have become \\"invalid\\" citizens, electronically tagged and shut out mainstream society of perfectly engineered \\"valid\\" humans. But, you would think, if there is sufficient technology to eradicate human flaws at conception, then surely someone must clever enough to fix them later in life too, no?).<br />The special effects team (who, in fairness, didn't have much to do other than the aforementioned toenail clipping close-ups and the odd distant rocket launch) seem to have missed the last 35 years in development of special effects.<br />The brother vs. brother thread is schmaltz (the whole relationship can be summed up, apparently, by who was the better swimmer when they were boys), ... Good grief.<br />What else... oh yes, the lack of chemistry between Uma Thurman and Ethan Hawke beggars belief (Thurman looks continually as if the very sight of Hawke gives her the screaming heebie jeebies), and the thriller/whodunnit piece does not import a sense of drama into the proceedings. And boy does the film need it.<br />The only saving grace is Jude Law, who seems to make his living these days propping up dreadful films with solid performances (see A.I. and The Road To Perdition in this regard), and who at the critical moment in the film, performs a very deft ascent of a spiral staircase without using his legs.<br />That is to be commended, however bad the rest of the experience.<br />Olly Buxton/>That is to be commended, however bad the rest of the experience. <br />Olly Buxton
B000067CPX|4.0|I don't consider myself a Red Hot Chili Peppers Fan.  I picked up a copy of Californication and gave it a listen, thought it was decent, so I kept it.  Just finished listening to By The Way, and I can easily say that this is a must-have.<BR>Gone for the most part are the irritating psuedo-rap numbers of their earlier years (Give It Away Now), this is an album full of music.  They still retain the Chili Peppers feel and sound that made Otherside such a good single, and they diversify their influences widely here.  But the diversity does not overshadow the music; more like it seasons the music.  This is a more mellow offering from their raucous days, and if they continue in this fashion, I'll be hooked.<BR>With the exception to By The Way, I thought the only dead moments on this disc were the songs that got a lot of radio play.<BR>I still don't consider myself a fan, but this is a great album.
B00003CXXM|3.0|The Bourne Identity is a perfectly watchable European spy-on-the-lam jaunt, best watched (as I did) as a captive audience, imprisoned  on a long-haul plane trip. It certainly appeals when the alternative is studying the emergency procedures card.<br />Matt Damon is credible, Robert Ludlum's plot is zippy, the central performances are solid enough (though the supporting cast is flakey, and the usually reliable Chris Cooper is plain ludicrous as Captain Trunk of the FBI).<br />However, any pretensions the film has to be anything more than a rehash of number of typical seventies euro-thrillers is bogus.<br />For one thing, the suggestions in the media that the Bourne Identity is \\"novel\\", \\"imaginative\\" or \\"refreshingly free of cliches\\" are way off the mark. I could barely see anything but retreaded cinematic technique: balaclava clad commandos abseiling through closed windows; the surgical removal of bullets, dropped clanking from forceps into tin dish, maniacal car-chases - clattering down stone staircases in Mini Coopers, if you will - cloak and dagger intrigue in the streets of old Europe: it all harks respectfully back to a time when for a film to have true class, it had to have Roger Moore or Sophia Loren in it. This is all good fun, of course, but shouldn't be confused with high concept cinema.<br />So if James Bond's your idea of an intelligent political thriller, the Bourne Identity is certainly a step up to the big league.<br />But other viewers may find it a little routine.
B00005JL78|5.0|Being a huge PKD fan is not necessary to enjoy this film. Tom Cruise & company really deliver the goods in this one. It keeps you totally engrossed from beginning to end. The action keeps you jumping throughout, and the mind of PKD is evident throughout. This film is the ultimate tribute to Phillip K. Dick's imagination, phobias and genius.
B000001DTM|5.0|I have been a fan of U2 since 1980. While they have a list of many great (an a couple not so great) albums, I think this was the boldest and brightest. Comming off the monster success of The Joshua Tree, the band could have rested on it's current formula for success, but instead they took a very new direction with this record. This record helped to set the tone of U2 for the next decade. This disc sounds as fresh today as it did over ten years ago.
0780624890|4.0|This was a great movie.  I first saw this when i was like 11 or something (now im 15), and then i thought it was a very gory movie, with all the blood and stuff.  Now i 've gotten past that and realized this is a very inventful and well written action adventure movie.  It pits Blade played by wesley snipes, against deacon frost, a crazy vampire. The action scenes are awesome, at first, you might just think of this as your average shoot-em up action movie.  But this has car chases, martial arts battles, swordfights, and gunfights.  <BR>   The equipment blade uses in these  intense situations only enhances this movie. Everything from his signature silver sword, to his automatic pistol, and his trusty shotgun with silver stakes.  This movie is far superior to blade 2.  Blade 2 was nothing but action.  Not that it's a bad thing, but in this movie, after the first couple action scenes, they start building up a nice little plot, like the whole familiar's and blood bank stuff, and discovering la magra, and trying to capture blade, and the whole stickin his mom in the middle of everything.  in blade 2, after they find out the problem (the reapers), they just go after them two times in a row, without advancing the plot. The finale was great, but what was blade fighting for? he seemed to be fighting just because he got bored and felt like killing a bunch of people.  <BR>    that's why blade works so much better than the sequel.  We got great characters, like blade, whistler, deacon frost, his mom, that guy from grounded for life, they all added a great part into the movie.  In blade 2, we get the blood pack, which honestly looks really stupid.  they're supposed to be some tactical military trained group, and they're just a bunch of dumb idiots who swear a lot. wtf? and Blade's love interest? she did nothing in this movie.  she couldn't even kill one darn thing in this movie.  and <BR>    anyways, this is a really great movie.  it is a great adventure.
B00005JKG9|5.0|Welcome to the world of real estate, where the golden rule always is \\"A.B.C.\\"  Always Be Closing.  This means, lie, cheat, steal, whatever.  As long as you get a signature on the dotted line, nothing else matters.  And times aren't the greatest for the salesmen at Premiere Properties.  None of them are getting the good leads that they need in order to close.  And if they don't start closing soon, they're going to find themselves out of the job.  There are the \\"Glengarry\\" leads, but they're reserved for closers only.  And this heated-up and emotional drama gets even more deeper when it turns out that the next day the office was broken into and the Glengarry leads were stolen.  In a business where lying, cheating, and stealing all are in a day's work, everyone is suspect.<br />I cannot believe I had never heard of \\"Glengarry Glen Ross\\" until recently.  As soon as I popped the DVD in, I fell in love with it immediately.  It is so well written and well acted that you can't do nothing but watch in awe.  And then, you want to watch it again and again.  I have just purchased this movie a couple of weeks ago, and I know my viewings of the film are already in the double digits.  This is a movie you can really watch whenever you want.  You don't need to be in a certain mood to enjoy it.<br />The cast is sensational.  You've got Al Pacino, Jack Lemmon, Ed Harris, Alan Arkin, Kevin Spacey, and Alec Baldwin.  Pacino is great as always and really steals the show during the second act of the film.  Your eyes never leave him for a second.  Jack Lemmon was also so terrific in it, and it's heartbreaking that he didn't win an Oscar.  Everybody else did great in their roles as well.<br />What I liked about this movie most was the realistic dialogue.  People may think that there's a lot of profanities in this film, but this is the real world.  People talk like this, especially in the business world.

0385720920|5.0|I was completely immersed in this novel by Chuck Palahniuk! I found this to be absolutely hilarious. I often found myself laughing maniacally outloud.  Victor Mancini is a dreadful man, but you have to love him. I love Palahniuk's ability to make you not only want to find out what happens to this character, but I was actually worried about him, and rooting for him. &quot;If I had a tumor I would name it Ida&quot; Poor Victor.  I thoroughly enjoyed his episodes at the Nursing home with all the patients, those were precious. Each person he came into contact with you didn't know who to feel more sorry for.<BR>The description of Victor job was so clear, I felt like I have been there.  Though not as shocking as Fight Club, the plot twist was surprising  and it did leave you a little off center. <BR>I loved it, anyone I have recomended it to loved it!  You must go out and buy this book, You must read it when you can laugh out loud, and enjoy all the insanity that flows through this novel effortlessly.
B000007T2Z|4.0|We would like to advise our customers that any individuals offering to pump opinions, wash minds, or solicit ideologies, is not employed by, or associated with this band. Thank you for listening to Godspeed you Black Emperor!, and have a pleasant day.<br />What I find horribly lacking in all these reviews is any cognizance of the fact that Godspeed is being *ironic* with their soundclips.  Perhaps this isn't immediately obvious from _F#A#inifinity_ alone.  But it certainly strikes me that while the tone of the man in \\"Dead Flag Blues\\" is appropriate to Godspeed's music, he is not meant to be taken seriously, any more than GYBE! are seriously advocating Arco am/pm mini market in _Skinny Fists_...or, for that matter, attempting to deride the 'preacher man' in \\"Providence,\\" on this album.  It is important to remember that they are a Canadian, not American band, and that notions of government corruption and bleak conspiracy are somewhat less well founded or regarded than if this band hailed from south of the border.  On Skinny Fists, they have chosen clips that are more obviously self-parodying, to make sure that people don't associate them with the words in their songs-- for instance, sticking fingers in babies' eyes, or a nutcase preacher on a mission to God, wherein the successful will think they are mad, and believe they have gone insane.  Don't be fooled by the earnestness of their speakers-- they don't speak for the band.<br />This is not to say that they do not have a beauty of their own, which is, possibly, the point.  Godspeed strips these people of their meaning, but leaves the beauty of their words and intonation intact-- the meaning of form without substance.  Godspeed is a band of emotion and beauty, and they find souls of kindred spirit in those whose opinions are to some degree laughable, yet whose sentiment is so intense that it is hard to laugh at them; similarly, they quote those whose sentiment is so false and shallow, compared to the intensity of GYBE's music, that despite their mainstream acceptability, one has to laugh at them-- Arco Am/pm and \\"so says the preacher man, but I don't go by what he says\\".<br />I like this album a lot, but I like Godspeed as a band even more.  Skinny Fists is better than this; it achieves heights that this CD doesn't even strive for.  That said, _F#A#infinity_ has its moments of glory, and is distinct from _Skinny Fists_ in that it has moments of joy, not just glory and extremity; it is not redundant with _Skinny Fists_, nor does it fail to be a good, moving work.  But with _Skinny Fists_, I feel the need to drop what I'm doing, scrunch up my face, and *feel* during the cresendos, sometimes to the point of crying; being 'good' just isn't enough for post rock, or this band in particular.  Godspeed knows how to resonate at the level of your very soul, so simply resonating, simply being enjoyable, simply being interesting and pleasing to the ear, is faint praise.  I would say this goes part way toward the raw, wrenching quality that the best indie and post rock groups can effect with pure instrumentation, but the strength of this album is in other areas.  It's wrenching enough to impress someone who's never heard Blonde Redhead, Sigur Ros, or Mogwai, and does enough interesting things with rhythm and melody enough to impress someone who hasn't heard Tortoise or Lateduster, but doesn't do either quite as well as the masters (in whom I include Godspeed, just not this album).  Perhaps if I was your typical Amazon[.com] reviewer, I'd give this 5 stars, but I regard that as inflation.
0066214122|1.0|The first section of this book was good, but after that it was downhill all the way!! I had to stop reading it after a certain point, (the first 160 pages or so), as it was so boring!<br />Prey takes us into the story of a mechanical plaque, and the desparate efforts of scientists to stop it. It speaks a lot of nantechnology and artificial disturbed intelligence. <br />The plot was weak and never really picked up again. I wouldn't waste my money on this book!
B00004BZ0N|5.0|This is a very creative, and rockin album. The guitars and drums and vocals are all good. Also look at the cover, is that like not the coolest cover to a rock album ever??? This band helped kickstart punk music in the 70's along with the Ramones and the Sex Pistols. The influence of this band on current bands can be seen, especially the jazz and reggae influences seen on Sublime could easliy trace their inspiration back to this ablum and the Clash in general. Highly reccomended!
B00000JCB2|5.0|The one album of theirs I can listen to everytime in it's entirety.
B00005JKZT|3.0|although this film is very well done and the actors do a very good job. the movie doesn't hold true to the book. however it is still worth seeing on the big screen.
B00005QZ7U|3.0|Think \\"Moulin Rouge\\" is Best Picture material?<br />Think more like \\"Gigi\\" on LSD. Or think 'Myra Breckinridge\\" but without the sex-change. Either way, laugh at the joke and move on.<br />Style over substance seems to be high on the list of the Oscar people lately. What else can explain \\"Gladiator\\" and \\"Moulin Rouge!\\" even GETTING nominations for best pic? Still, despite the fact that there's no \\"there\\" there, \\"Moulin Rouge!\\" is a serious piece of eye candy. Stunning set, computer, and costume work make this one of the most visually interesting movies ever filmed. Baz Luhrmann's eye is golden here. The Art Nouveau meets \\"Rocky Horror Picture Show\\" design is unforgettable and carries the entire piece.<br />The cast camps it up enough to make John Waters proud. The leads, Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman, are luminous and - frighteningly - equally pretty. And they are asked to shift gears so many times in the film's running that only Oscar-caliber actors could have pulled it off. Jim Broadbent is also winning in his role of the Rouge's owner/emcee.<br />But the film doesn't work. The camp obscures the drama; there's a huge sell factor here and everything just can't be bought. The choice to do a musical is inspired, but the decision to go with modern songs crashes the film/audience barrier and just crushes the mood. There's something about watching the leads trade lines from the likes of U2 and Pet Shop Boys that  takes the groan factor to another level. Turning The Police's \\"Roxanne\\" into a tango number was the final straw for me. Ha ha to the film's producers. They got us good.<br />As for the two-disc DVD, it adds a few enhanced scenes and a decent selection of the usual DVD add-ons. Its okay, but not groundbreaking.<br />One major problem with the DVD was sound. The levels were just too wide - too loud in song selections, too soft in many of speaking sections. And sadly, the dialog boost was spotty, particularly during songs. I found myself constantly adjusting the volume, finally gave up, and just turned on the subtitles.<br />If you want a feast for the eyes, get \\"Moulin Rouge!\\" now. Those looking for anything else will be disappointed.volume, finally gave up, and just turned on the subtitles.<br />If you want a feast for the eyes, get \\"Moulin Rouge!\\" now.

B0000062FL|5.0|This is one of the greatest albums ever. The writing was great, as was the playing, while still retaining the youthful idealism of the band. It hinted at the jazz-rock direction that Carlos was headed in, but certainly held onto the pop sensibility that was present in the band's previous debut album. It also hints at some great hard rock leanings, such in such as &quot;I Hope You're Feeling Better,&quot; and &quot;Mother's Daughter&quot;. This is a must-own for all Santana fans, from casual to serious. No one played this kind of groove as well as this band.<br />The new disc, &quot;Shaman&quot;, has nothing on this album. &quot;Shaman&quot; will be forgotten by next week. It's garbage. Don't bother with it, get &quot;Abraxas&quot; instead.
B00007DWRZ|4.0|Finally they made their partnership official. Do not take this album as a new &quot;tropicalist&quot; movement. Forget &quot;Mary Cristo&quot;. Just enjoy the good musical teamwork. The voice of Marisa, the poetry of Arnaldo and the freshness &amp; rhythm of Brown. A must have!
B00005YW4H|5.0|I purchased this album when it first came out and it's still in my cd player in my car. After a long hard day at work, this album brings a refreshing quietness that I need. I let a friend borrow this album and she ended up keeping mine and buying me a new one because she liked it so much. Buy it. You won't be sorry!!!
B00004U8P9|5.0|This DVD has so much stuff about the movie that I had never seen.  It has both the UK and US version (not much difference..) But the second disk has a wealth of stuff about the whole film itself from interviews with the cast (except for Tim unf.)  Its also fun to watch some of the other features.  All in all, you'll love this DVD if you love the movie, or just transexual vampires in general...
0066214122|3.0|Prey starts out slow with the domestic life of the main character.  It is only about 100 pages into the book that the plot begins to get interesting.  Be sure to stick with it even though the first few chapters are a bore.  Once Prey starts going it is hard to put down, and many plot twists keep you on the edge of your seat.  There are, however, some major flaws.  The book's subject matter seems very far-fetched.  It is hard to imagine that something similar to the events in the book could actually happen.  Also, the science that lays the foundation for the book was very complex and hard for me to understand.  Next, the ending is confusing and leaves a fair number of questions unanswered.  Prey will be enjoyed by fans of Crichton, like me, but those not familiar with his work would be advised to pass Prey by.  He has written better books, that are more interesting and easier to understand.

B00003CXXP|3.0|I actually liked this movie. I liked the special effects, I liked Jude Law (Hey, Joe, Whaddya know?) I liked the portrayal of humans as less humane than the robots. I'm not a Haley fan by a long shot, but he does a good job in this movie. That said...<br />This is actually a trilogy (or maybe more). There's a begining, a middle and an end movie; it's at least three movies in conception, and it's long enough to be three movies in fact. There are quite a few stories going on here. They're sort of tied together by the main thread, but it's a loose tie, and there are loose ends (or incomplete finishes). A lot of these subplots are big enough to be a movie on their own. And it can be very, very slow. I was somewhat bored, had to pee, and wished heartily for a bottle of wine and a sandwich at about the halfway point.<br />I know writers and directors hate editors because they cut bits of your loved script out... but it's like surgery. If you get a good editor, you can have a healthier, leaner, better film or book. Without one, you can have overweight ideas. This movie, to stay a single movie, needs an editor. Or maybe a diet.<br />Maybe on DVD, where you can pause it and get up, it'll be somewhat easier to get through.
B00005U2JM|3.0|I bought this video a few weeks ago and it was O.K. But I wish I had gotten Marilyn Manson~God Is In the T.V. instead. This video is just a compilation of clips of Manson performing LIVE! infront of various crowds in various locations. If you've seen some of his other stuff then you've probably seen this one. However, it is very arty and the music is very clear. That's a good thing. And ofcourse, this video is not wholesome family entertainment. There's a scene in which Manson urines (!) on the stage. The video also contains nudity and strong language. But I still got a fair kick out of it. I'm not easily offended, so it didn't bother me the least bit. Christians are strongly advised to steer clear of this thing! Manson is the self-proclaimed \\"Antichrist Superstar\\", and I think that's cool!!!<BR>You should hear the speech that Manson gives during the credits at the end of the video. Manson actually reads from the bible! But not your typical serman. So be alert!!! Buy God Is In the T.V. I am planning on getting that one next time.
B00005JKZT|5.0|This movie is SO AWESOME! It is definately one of the best movies ever. I've been waiting since last year to see this movie, and it totally rocked! It was released today, and I went to see it. I had really high expectations for this movie. Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring was one of my favorite movies, and I was hoping (and expecting) this movie to be just as good, if not better. And it totally was! This movie is undescribably good. It's exciting, it's partly romance, it's got a lot of action. I do recommend that you see the first movie first, because this movie would make much more sense.<br />This movie continues the stories of the characters from Fellowship of the Ring. Their paths have split up, and they're in groups doing different things. It's got adventure and fighting in it, just like the first movie, and it has more of the characters' stories. Oh yeah, and the special effects are totally awesome!<br />This movie is a must-see for anyone who even slightly likes Lord of the Rings. If you thought the first Lord of the Rings was okay, you'll most likely like this one. If you liked the first Lord of the Rings, you'll most likely love this movie. It is one of the greatest movies ever. I actually liked it better then the first Lord of the Rings movie, which is totally amazing. This movie totally passed beyond my high expectations. Everyone, SEE THIS MOVIE! IT IS COMPLETELY, TOTALLY AWESOME!!! I'm not exaggerating at all! The only bad thing is, now we have to wait a whole more year for the last movie! Oh well, everyone can just watch the other two Lord of the Rings movies untill then ^_^. Anyway, I totally reccomend this movie. It completely rocks.
0062511408|5.0|Inspirational book.  It combines passion, happiness, failure, and triumph into a simple plot that ultimately reminds us of the important things in life.  I was sad when it ended...
B00005JKZT|5.0|I was one of the first people to see the second instalment in the Epic tale that is Lord of the Rings. To begin, Two Towers which is the second part in the ongoing Tolkien tale of Middle Earth starts off where it finished in the Fellowship of the Ring. <br />The tale of Sam Gangee and Frodo Baggins is but a sub-plot in this film as the film follows the story of Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli and the battle of Helm's Deep. I should mention that this film does not pursue the Adventure Genre that its predecessor had done. Two Towers will remind you more of a war genre, such as Patton, than the mystical journey of the ring. And this is not for the worse, the depiction of Good Vs Evil runs rampant throughout the 3 hours of the film in awe-inspiring visuals. The cinematography in the film is much darker when we get glimpses of what Sauron's forces are doing in Mordor while we get much brighter cinematography when seeing the Elvish and Human lands near Helm's Deep. <br />The CGI (Computer Generated Images) is used to perfection when portraying the image of 10,000 Orcs strong waiting to go into battle. The Costumes and Make-up displayed throughout the evil army captures the gritty, ugly and Medieval style that Peter Jackson (Director) brings to the audience.  The location manager of the film must be commended also for finding the sites of the main locations thoroughly described in Tolkien's tale. One of the first things you will notice in the film is the beautiful landscapes. New Zealand as the choice of Middle Earth was one of the smartest decisions the Film team could of made and this can be seen when multiple locations that exhibit completely different styles can all be filmed in the one country. Amazing.<br />The acting is once again stellar. All characters are played to perfection as their character development is evident throughout the film. Aragorn becomes more and more of a leader, Legolas and Gimli start to form a friendship, Merry and Pippen gain more bravery and courage plus Sam and Frodo portray the understanding of their destiny's to a T. Another aspect of the film and characters that should be mentioned is that there is more comedy in this story. Gimli comes into his own when his height becomes exploited and he complies to being `tossed'. This is the best time to add the comedy as it is the middle part of the Legendary tale and would not have been a wise choice to include in the first part (Establishing the Danger) or the third part (The pivotal dramatic ending).<br />The Score is once again magical. The Orchestration gives you that energetic feel as though you want to be there fighting to save Middle-earth. There is not one aspect to change about the music as it surpasses its original purpose and gives you a more dramatic and unforgettable edge to the film. <br />The construction of the film may be a deterrent to some people as it is the very middle section of Lord of the Rings. While in Fellowship there was a beginning to the film, The Two Towers immediately goes into the thick of the story giving us a brief summary of each of the characters and where they're located. You may also find yourself thinking why you're watching a 3 hour epic of a film with no real ending. Simple. Its brilliant. If you have not read the books, you want to know what obstacles the characters will encounter and most probably see some action plus can proudly claim that you have seen this classic of a film. And for those who have read the book, you would want to know how alike and dislike the book is to the film and how each moment will be portrayed compared to your imagination and/or Tolkien's novel description. I have to stress that this is a Must-See!<br />For all those Bloodthirsty fans out there who want to see the warriors `Hunt some Orc' shall not be disappointed as the battle of Helm's Deep will surpass your expectations in the 45 minute long battle-fest. An interesting note, the actors and extras that did this battle found it to be the mostgruelling scene out of all them. As it was filmed at night in the rain and they had to wait hours on end to get a shot set-up while some battled with hyperthermia. Now that just shows the raw passion and commitment to make this film grow beyond people's wildest expectations.<br />We are also joined by all the favourite and significant characters in the first film. **Spoilers** Gandalf makes his return as Gandalf the White and makes a memorable quote to set up the final chapter of Middle-earth. \\"The battle of Helm's Deep has ended. Now the battle for Middle-earth had Begun\\". We are also joined again by the schizophrenic hybrid of Gollum, who we see in full for the first time and is the best CG character to ever grace the cinema screen. We are also joined by a few new characters of Treebeard, who helps the comedy duo of Merry and Pippen through their escape of Mordor. Each are classics in their own right.<br />To finish off, this movie is a must-see. It may not have that first magical experience you encountered during the first movie but it delivers what it set out to do and create a stunner of a film. The acting, CGI, story, costumes, make-up, locations, characters, cinematography and score is absolutely extraordinary. I really couldn't make up my mind if this movie surpassed the first film (Probably have to watch it again) but I can tell you it is a 5 star movie. Each person will have their own preference to which movie they favour but believe me, it will be hard to decide. <br />And Always Remember... <br />...`One ring to rule them all'!

I won't say much more about the plot because I'm sure the 300+ reviews will say it for me, but I will say it's worth your time to read. <br />Don't take it seriously and just enjoy the humour and the events that take place.
0887306667|5.0|I have had this book for years and often pull it out and leaf through it before writing an ad or thinking through a marketing idea. The book is so good I gave it to a friend who didn't know how to get a handle on marketing his new idea. Now, I want another copy and am buying a replacement today. Sure glad it is still in print.<br />Some readers want a laid out formula, (duh, step one, step two...) which is okay for the un-creative. I prefer Ries and Trout`s approach which invites readers to think in a curious and interesting,  but oh so elegantly simple, manner. Thanks Ries and Trout.
B000006OAM|5.0|This one is a keeper; I think of it whenever the time honored question comes up as to what I would bring to a desert island. Anything but pretentious and gloomy Natalie is an inspired singer/songwriter with an angelic voice that haunts and a knack for making personal observations come across as universal truths relatable to any listener who is tired of  shrieking divas ala Mariah, Whitney, Celine and the odious, overmarketed J.Lo. This album is soulful without being overbearing and sad only in so far as depth of feeling is bound to be heavy.<BR>Life is Sweet is my favorite track and has become almost something of a personal anthem.<BR>If Natalie is performing in a town near you take the time to see her: in live performances she is accomplished, graceful and memorable.
B00005JK8K|1.0|As a fan of both war movies and of Nicholas Cage I was very excited to see this movie.  However, I was left greatly disappointed.  This movie is horribly inaccurate coupled with poor acting by most.  Nicholas Cage seems to be able to kill 5 men with every 1 shot.  Seemed very unrealistic to me...........

0790749815|5.0|Many people in my generation think that movie-history began with &quot;Back to the future&quot; and ended in &quot;Titanic&quot;. Don't get me wrong, I like both of them, but, really, cinema is way more than that. When I ask information about older movies to older people they seem to loose focus, their eyes become lost in the far horizon, and they say &quot;Yes, this is a great movie&quot;. But the problem is, they say that to EVERY old movie. I once tried to watch Casablanca; in fact, I watched the whole movie, but I didn't really like it. Casablanca is not an ageless movie, so I think it meant more to people who saw it when it was released than to me, watching it forty five years later.<br />With &quot;North by northwest&quot;, however, the situation was completely different. First of all, it is listed number 18 on imdb's top 250 films of all time. Second, I have watched the more famous Hitchcock movies, like &quot;Rear window&quot;, &quot;Psycho&quot;, &quot;Vertigo&quot;, etc, and I find Hitchcock an amazing director. His techniques, his directing style, are very similar to what we see in movies today, to what I'm used to expect in a movie. And I think his films deal with subjects that don't seem to get old.<br />In &quot;North by northwest&quot;, Cary Grant is the man on the run for being mistaken for an agent he is not. During all the movie, he has to escape his nemesis, in famous and unforgettable scenes like the plane-man walking chase and the final pursuit on top of Mount Rushmore. When there is no action scene, there is the BEST dialogue I've ever seen on screen (very funny, fast and intelligent), between (mostly) Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint, the beautiful double-agent who falls in love with Grant.<br />This is really one of the most enterteining movies I've ever seen. I'm not going to say things like &quot;Nowadays, we don't have movies like that anymore&quot; because it's not true. People used to make good movies, and they're still making it today.

0060920084|4.0|Bill Bryson has the humor of Dave Barry and the travel instincts of a less snobbish Paul Theroux. The mix is pure pleasure and at times so hilarious it should come with the warning: read in privacy unless you don't mind  helpless displays of public cackles and tears on planes, trains and automobiles. A native of Des Moines and a longtime resident of London he takes this nostalgic tour across his homeland with a flask of vinegar and a pot of honey. He can't help feeling love and appreciation for the sometimes pathetic but often well meaning yokels he encounters on this quest to find the perfect small town. At his best he is as perceptive and scathing as Mark Twain but walks away enamored with a country obsessed with gaudiness and quick buck fixes of dubious glamor.Haven't we all met the Reaganite good old boy who injects his diatribes about how Nixon was robbed without concern to the general drift of the conversation only to turn a corner and be wowed by the generosity and spaciousness of the guy one seat over on the barstool! It's actually a tough love letter that rings true and makes the affection sound genuine and earned.
6304539282|5.0|The video and audio quality of this trilogy is excellent. I have the previous trilogy, the original one with no video nor audio enhancements and there is a big difference between them in terms of quality.

B00006JDS4|3.0|I saw this movie on video back in the 80s when I was about 8 years old (see...not all kids who watch r rated movies turn out to be criminals or have psychological issues), so thats why I only gave it 3 stars. I just can't remember the dialogue and overall production of the film. I do remember the plot though and its about a group of men who rape and torture this woman out in the woods and instead of crawling into a hole of depression and despair, the woman decides to strike back and get her revenge against these men. One by one she lures them into her trap by romancing them, torturing them and KILLS them! I remember being creeped out by the movie and since it made it to DVD, then obviously I must not be the only out there that thinks this B movie is a classic. Check it out...
B00005QFHG|2.0|I have read through a fair number of reviews, and I see that many people have taken exception to this film's anti-Catholic attitudes and pervasive Liberalism.  Well, nobody will ever accuse me a being a great friend of Roman Catholicism or of being a staunch conservative, but I too found this film to be pretty hard to stomach at times.<br />What was most annoying for me was how black and white everything was in this film.  The liberated chocolatier versus the stuffed shirt mayor.  Worldly cosmopolitanism versus small-town provincialism.  I expect more from Lasse Hallstrom than a bunch of straw men waiting to be knocked down.<br />I found the chocolatier to be unbearably smug, as she deftly solves, one after another, the various problems afflicting the townspeople.  You would think that these folks must be dumb as posts, because they seem incapable of solving their own predicaments.  Perhaps it is in fact because these types of problems are so rarely solved with a few simple words and some chocolate goodies.<br />The treatment of the mayor was particularly hard to take.  Here was a man of obviously deep convictions who took his duties to his town quite seriously, yet he is an object of ridicule throughout the film.  His chocolate-induced collapse at the end of the movie struck me as a false note that could not be possibly be reconciled to the personality we had seen on the screen for the previous two hours.  It seem extremely contrived?  Is it possible that the filmmakers could not successfully resolve this storyline about the conflict between the two main characters?  Left with no resolution to the move, were they forced to cobble together this ridiculous conclusion?  It just seemed too forced and unbelievable.<br />I don't like movies that pretend to have all of the answers.  However, the cinematography and music was very nice; for that, I give it 2 stars.
0792842073|5.0|I believe this to be one of the topnotch \\"issue\\" films ever made. While the wide majority of pictures caters to the lowest common denominator and plays to its presceened audience this movie takes a controversial topic, the death penalty, and sheds light on it from every corner. There are no moral shortcuts here, no easy cop-outs and no last minute sermons. It shows the brutality of murder whether it's committed in brutal depravity or government sanctioned cleanliness. One walks away from it with an overwhelming understanding for the basest instincts in humanity and how they are intricately woven into all our psyches. Sarandon is luminous as a nun trying to bring dignity to one doomed man who she knows to be a vicious killer and still thinks deserves better than the system that is condemning his act and then taking it upon itself to snuff out his life. It becomes a story not about who deserves to die but who deserves to kill.
B000000OA6|5.0|You know you're dying.  You have to give birth to as much quality music as you possibly can, and the pressure and unknown time constraints are enough to kill you anyway.  So what do you do? You do the only thing you can do, which is justify why music exists: you create a work of music that can live forever.  The album is Innuendo.  Queen was and is popular, but always deserved much more.  This album manifests why.  \\"The Show Must Go On\\" is one of the top 10 greatest songs ever written (in my book), if not the best, and it gives you an out of body experience.  The opening title track reminds us why Queen (along with Bon Jovi) is the best rock band to ever exist.  \\"Don't try so hard\\" makes me feel it was written just for me.  \\"These are the Days of Our Lives\\" will make you cry.  The video was the last captured footage of him, ever.  Do music history a favor and buy this album.<br />And I'm not even reviewing the Made in Heaven Album!
B00005JKZT|5.0|I saw this movie today and there could be no better way for it to be made. It starts out perfectly; setting the scene. It ends with a similar feel to The Fellowship of the Ring, only much darker. The Helm's Deep and Rohan scenes were amazing... very well done. The Ents are really amazing and fun to watch. Gollum is also a very entertaining character and very well created. The scenes of the Elven Haven of Rivendell are just as beautiful if not more than The Fellowship of the Ring although fairly short. Aragorn's dreams of Arwen are very touching and lovely. The only thing I don't like is that I have to wait an ENTIRE year for the next movie, The Return of the King, to come out. Start the Countdown...
0316666343|2.0|This book made no sense.  It was not even a good murder mystery.  If that is the writer's view of heaven, I feel sorry for her.  She has nothing to look forward to except an eternity of what equates to real life television shows.  Everyone suffers and the murderer is never brought to justice.  Maybe that is what life is like for some, but who wants to read a fictional novel about it.  I rate this right up there with Oprah's pick...House of Sand and Fog.
0425166805|1.0|Von Daniken represents the worst of the archaeological community.  When pressed to write a paper about pseudoscience and bad archaeology, I turned to this book, which yielded plenty of material.  <BR>Von Daniken simply refuses to put any of his \\"studies\\" into their proper cultural context -  which is dangerous and simply wrong.  I am all for new ways of thinking, but this is not enough to even raise an eyebrow.  <BR>Past civilizations deserve credit for their astounding achievements; Von Daniken yanks it away and hands it over to ET.
B000001FYL|5.0|(...)  Tonight I just got back from a 3 hour long marathon heated discussion with my piano professor about the usual topic, \\"pop\\" vs. \\"classical\\" (I hate labels) and I now view it as my godgiven destiny to proclaim to everyone the entity that is the Blaze of Glory album.<br />No, I'm not a 35 year old who's been into Bon Jovi since the Runaway and Farenheit days (though I was quick to catch up), but I can't do anything about that.  At the age of 10, I saw the Blaze of Glory Video on TV, and that is the reason for everything I have chosen to do to this day.  <br />Yes, I guess I am slightly biased, being a hardcore Jovi fan for a good 12 years and counting now, but... I'll do my best here to try to put myself on the level of all the \\"Ew that is cheesy hair metal\\" people that I have had the misfortune of being surrounded by all my life, if just to try to reach them somehow. (Is that possible?)<br />Please forgive me if this review doesn't seem to the point, but I view it as necessary.  The bottom line is, although Jon Bon Jovi is not Beethoven (though I foolishly tried to draw some parallels to that earlier this evening), he has \\"it.\\" What is \\"it?\\" It's not a selloutcheezyleaterpantslonghairspandexpretensious element that most people my age seem to see in him (or the band for that matter).  But it is an element that has evolved and perfected itself in the form of Jon Bon Jovi.  He is not fake.  He writes, sings, and plays from the heart, I swear to God.  I don't care how much of a Jazz, Beatles, Techno, Nirvana, Bach, or Rap (or Def Leppard, for that matter) lover you are.  When you put this album on and you are engulfed by the surreal power of \\"Sante Fe\\", \\"Miracle\\", the title track, and \\"Justice in the Barrel\\", you learn (or are vividly reminded) why music exists in the first place.  And what else do you need? \\"It\\" is had by few, but if you let it in, who knows, it may just save your life at some point, or atleast get you through some tough times.  I am very seriousabout this.  With the possible exception of the leadoff \\"Billy Get Your Guns\\" and the awesome Little Richard Romp \\"You Really Got Me Now\\" (which are great songs, btw), every other song on this album was given to us from God himself.  No, I am not saying Jon Bon Jovi is God.  But I am saying that music connects with the human soul in such a profound way, that some other force, or SOMETHING, let Jon into the \\"stream of light\\", or whatever you will call it, so he could tap some of that great energy and call it his own, on this album.  No, he isn't the greatest musician in the world.  On the band albums, Richie and Dave are what make that so remarkable.  But although some classical buffs (and I'm sure many others) cringe at me saying this, the emotion evoked on the \\"So I save a prayer...\\" bridge of \\"Sante Fe\\" is NOT out of league with that found in the Beethoven 9th or the Rachmaninoff 2nd.  <BR> <BR>So from one little video from 1990, where Jon Bon Jovi lip-synchs on the top of a beautiful cliff in the middle of nowhere, comes atleast one \\"impressionable\\" life, that being myself.  With a degree in classical piano, I myself will now be trying to be the \\"next biggest thing\\" or whatever euphemism one must call such a blessing/curse.  Hopefully, it will be something that makes some sort of a bridge between openminded classical people and rock enthusiasts.  I don't like Jon only for his appearance, as is the case with most crazy people who stand in line for 1st row seats that don't know half the lyrics.  I like him for his MUSIC.  What a novel concept! The terms Bon Jovi and HIGH LEVEL OF MUSICIANSHIP used in the same breath!  Well, the critics never cared to state anything like that, so let me be the first.  I really appreciate you reading this, and though you might not be the gullable 10 year old that I was (of course I'll admit there was and is commercialism in it, you can't play the game without it), I don't care who you are.  If you are a legitimately decent human being, you will buy this album, listen to it with great focus, and find Jon Bon Jovi bleeding his heart out in every NONCLICHE (that's right) lyric he puts forth.  I think I'm a bigger fan of the album than he is, but ... so what?<br />Thank You All For Your Time and Rock and Roll will never die,<BR>Doug...
B00007E8O5|5.0|Perhaps we'll all be familiar with a little more than half the material found on this new and intended version of Jerry Cantrell's DEGRADATION TRIP, but this is even better than the original 14-track version, which was quite good in and of itself. But when you experience the rest of this 25-track double disc, with over two hours worth of music, you'll find this is the way Jerry should have released it in the first place.<br />Of the new tracks featured on this 2-disc delight, \\"Owned\\", \\"Pro False Idol\\", and \\"31/32\\" have exceptional mastery and sound. \\"Owned\\" is one of those tracks that would make such a perfect single, with it's sinister guitar and melodic chorus. \\"Pro False Idol\\" is over seven minutes of thick, sludgy riffs and dark tones, but it's bonafied Jerry. Also, the eight minute-plus \\"Pig Charmer\\" is a darker, harder track...but it shows texture, depth, and the guitar work is as only Jerry can play. Also worthy of mention is the haunting instrumental \\"Hurt's Don't It\\" and the acoustic/electric \\"What It Takes\\" is terrific. <br />You've also got favorites from the original DEGRADATION TRIP like the soaring, raucous \\"Anger Rising\\", the beautiful and charming \\"Angel Eyes\\", and the countrified \\"Gone\\", as well as the stomp of \\"She Was My Girl\\", and the opening psychosis of \\"Psychotic Break\\" with it's sinister tones and eeriely haunting chorus. Also of mention should be \\"Give It A Name\\" with it's bluesy feel, and \\"Hellbound\\", another edgy, fist-pumping track.<br />With this double-disc limited edition DEGRADATION TRIP: Volumes 1 & 2, all of us should be easily satisfied with the disc. This meaty 140 minute double delight will take time to digest; once you do, however, you'll find that this TRIP was very much worth the ride. Highly recommended to anyone who appreciates a solo artist in his top form.
B000059T00|5.0|in the summer of 1969 i,was 11 years old and just began to work weekends with my fathers drywall business.i also began buying my own things,clothes,bikes,music,ect.in the past i had bought(picked out)other records, ray charles,hank williams sr., earlier james brown,otis redding,ect.i now know in which direction my musical tastes were headed.i was at a friends home,he also had the same musical tastes,he put this record on his dad's state of the art Mc intosh stereo it blew me away,way away!! needless to say,i was hooked!since that time i've bought 1000's of records(tapes,cd's)in that same style mainly blues,but this is the one that really turned me on,rick grech and ginger baker's backbeat and tempo is perfect for the leads of eric clapton's smoldering guitar licks and steve winwoods vocals.there isn't a track on this one that doesn't, well....just doesn't!i still have that first atco records copy although,i don't play it any more,i just keep it to remind myself,this is the one that turned my musical ear,forever.there's alot of great new music out there now,but the music of my youth, the music that kept a whole generation going, is the music that has gotten me through some of the worst and best times of my life.when one finds something that works,stick with it!!
B00006LLNU|3.0|I have been blown away by Sigur Ros before, but () doesn't do it.  The CD has a pleasant sonic texture, but it never rises above pleasant.  The album inset is fitting: page after page of somewhat pretty photos of the same nothing in particular.
B00000I07P|4.0|Yes, this is a &quot;classic.&quot;  Though not the musical muscle flex of their later works (you MUST go endure my ranting review of the Blaze of Glory Album if you haven't already), Slippery When Wet not only 1) generated the mass hits that for many people are the only Bon Jovi songs they know, 2)saved Bon Jovi's career and ALLOWED them to make better albums later on, 3) defined an era, and 4) unified a &quot;band sound&quot; for them, but it was the embryo of what would become the most profound emotional journey as the band marched onward to later albums.  This is an essential album both for the band to have made, and for anyone's collection.  I don't care how many copies it sells (though please go by another copy so we can see the thing push another platinum level), it's not as good as Jersey, Blaze of Glory (the holy grail), or Faith, ... but it IS good, and when in the right mood, it can still serve emotional functions even after having been listened to for a decade and a half.  If you don't have it, would you please just go get it? Enough said about Slippery.
B0000062GE|5.0|Even better than NIN&quot;S downward spiral.<BR>If you are a fan of industrial or rock music buy this album,<BR>It's lyrics have to be some of the best I have read and have inspired me in so many ways.<BR>The music itself is intoxicating though without tragic elements and intentions of depression, admittingly there are a few depressing songs though without these the album would not be the wok of art that it is.<br />I was a fan of NiN,M.Manson, Tool etc... before I was a SW fan and after this album I  must say tha they have taken the top mantle.<br />From the contagious beats of songs such as:<BR>Torn apart, Drugstore and Save yourself.<br />To the mourningfull and heart wrenching lyrics of:<BR>How can I hold on, Sometimes it hurts and waking up beside you.<br />It is by far the best album they have produced .<br />If you are a rock fan BUY This album. It is the best investement you will ever make...Truly inspirational.
B00006F83Y|5.0|I got online, downloaded \\"Songs for the Deaf\\" but it was looped! But just from what I heard on the loop I absolutley loved it. I went to Fry's and bought the CD. First song I switched to was \\"Songs for the Deaf\\" cause I was dying to hear the full version. The song shattered my windows and kicked my ass. Then I listened to \\"Go with the Flow\\" \\"Songs for the Dead\\" \\"The Sky is Falling\\" and I was like \\"WHO are these guys? My god!\\" I was shocked since I'm an avid rock listener and just recently heard of these guys.<br />I then got online. Downloaded \\"Auto Pilot\\" and \\"Better Living Through Cemistry\\" and once again, I fell off my chair. Wow! Stoner rock is brilliant. Bought the album \\"Rated R\\", heard \\"The Lost Art Of Keeping a Secret\\" and \\"In the Fade\\" and I was once again just stunned. Queens of the...what? It sucks all this mainstream rock just shoves all these original, classical masterpieces to the bottom. <br />Goodness gracious! <BR>By the way - Dave Grohl... I mean, possibably one of the most talented drummers of all time?
B00005JKZT|5.0|I went to see the Fellowship of the Ring a year ago on the day it was released. I have been a Tolkien fan for as long as I can remember and thought that the movie could not be as good as the book. I was wrong. Peter Jackson has done an excellent job adapting the book. The Two Towers deviated from the book more than the Fellowship of the Ring, but Tolkien fans will still enjoy it, as I did. The Battle of Helm's Deep is spectatcular and the effects are astounding. They take you into a whole different world. I am also pleased by the story, actors, and costumes, which are magnificent. The only two complaints I might make are: <br />1. Arwen has become a whole main character where she was barely mentioned in the book.<BR>2. Haledir died.<br />Gimili was hilarious, and even Gollum was realistically done. I must repeat how much I enjoyed this movie and cannot wait for it to come out on video.
B000002A3T|5.0|Music is just music.  To me, this album is one of the best albums ever made.  It is not a curveball into commercialism (nor was Momentary Lapse of Reason).  When a band member has left, you must EXPECT a different sound - what surprises me, is how similar it is to old Floyd - not that the rest of the world doesn't disagree with me, of course - but don't think I don't know what I'm talking about.  The early Floyd was about painting a picture, an ambience, a work of art, not a series of singles and/or filler.  The Division Bell has something in common with the older works.  It too, is more than just a series of singles and/or filler.  So what if a song appeals to lots of people?  Oftentimes, it's because the song is shallow and simple, yes, but sometimes the stars do line up right - and this is coming from a pessimist, mind you - and there is the same unified atmospheric creation to this that there is to Atom Heart Mother, it's just the songs are different lengths and the thematic material is different.  Ok, and some instrumentation differences.... but still...  &quot;Poles Apart&quot;, &quot;Coming Back to Life&quot;, &quot;A Great Day for Freedom&quot;, &quot;Lost for Words&quot; ? If you want to zone out after a rough day, or meditate to music, or whatever you like doing....do not avoid this album. There is emotional spirituality in this album that is rarely found in music these days, or anywhere, for that matter.  Avoid the prejudice and the album will love you back.
B000063UR2|5.0|Well this DVD is certainly a love or hate purchase.<BR>Legend is a masterful film that fell victim to the \\"Suits\\" of the film world. But that has now been fixed.<BR>First the directors cut is not a completely new edit but the original first cut of the film before it was cut for the European version and then again chopped and a new score added for the US. So what we have here folks is, for the most part, the original original edit of this film. Not a film where scenes were thrown back in, if anyone has seen the original Euro version (I have)the US may have lost more story but we got a vastly superior edit way back when.<BR>As for the music scores, well I like the Jerry Goldsmith score 100 times better than I used to after seeing the 114 minute version but I still favor the TD score as the most mysterious and haunting of the two. I wish there had been a way to get a melding of the scores but as this wasn't a totaly new edit of the film they used what they had on the original 114 minute version. I also know both TD and Jerry G. were not thrilled with how their scores were handled for this film.<BR>Is this film for kids? Good heavens NO! Children under ten should not see this film unless their parents are sure some of the trully spooky bad guys aren't going to give them nightmares! If anyone tells you this movie is great for kids they obviously don't realize how terrifying Blix, Darkness and Meg Mucklebones can bee to a small child, no to mention the dark aspects of the film and the seductive quality that Tim Curry put into his performance of Darkness.<BR>PLEASE please if you have children watch this film first to make sure it will not frighten them. Not all kids are the same what is wonderful to some, is terrifying to another! Heck the same is true for adults!!!<BR>The DVD is amazingly full of fun info, documentaries deleted clips and other info, I love that they also put the original US release so that if you prefer that one you can watch that instead of the 114 minute version and still get all the extras!
B000002N3J|4.0|What a surprise!<BR>Everyone expected Madonna to release a new album in 1995, but she comes up with this delicious collection of love songs.<BR>I believe she wanted to show the world that there is more to her shocking attitude.<BR>She's grown up, she's found the meaning of love..and she sings it!<BR>The package is a treat from start to end: THIS USED TO BE MY PLAYGROUND is finally available on a Madonna record, FORBIDDEN LOVE off BEDTIME STORIES was given a thumbs up status by the lady on contrary to what the label did.<BR>LOVE DON'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE is remixed and gets a wider syntheziers momentum.<BR>And then she finally teams up with David Foster!<BR>Unfortunately not with Diane Warren...that's still my # 1 wish.<BR>YOU'LL SEE is TAKE A BOW part II (see video also), ONE MORE CHANCE is acoustic and intimate while I WANT YOU is Madonna once again not being commercial and covering Marvin Gaye - you get two versions of the song (the more electronic one featuring Massive Attack and an orchestral one which is even better!).<BR>Why not 5 stars then? Because if this is a love songs compilation, then there is no way that BAD GIRL should be left out....
B00006CXXU|5.0|Can't Hold Us Down - A song with a good beat. 7/10<br />Walk Away - Shows the kind of voice Christina really has. Good song. 10/10<br />Fighter - I like this song.

Reminds me of traveling in your car for a couple hours, just sitting back and relaxing. Very nice. 9/10<br />Soar - Good song. 8/10<br />Get Mine, Get Yours - This song has a good beat, and it's not bad to listen to. Catchy. 9/10<br />Dirrty - Not as good as the one above, but good to dance to. 7/10<br />The Voice Within - Pretty song. 10/10<br />I'm Okay - now this is the song that made me cry. not because i can relate to it, because my family life has been pretty stable throughout my life. but one of my best friends lives a life like this, and just thinking about it makes me go up in tears. my favorite song on the album besides beautiful. 10/10<br />Keep on Singin' My Song - an okay song. 7/10<br />All in all, this is a VERY good cd. i highly recommend that you buy it. you won't regret your purchase. it's very different from her previous albums, and with many singers, change is good.

0385503954|3.0|Beautiful, beautiful writing, and clever, and crafted by a master word-smith, but there must be something else to satisfy, not necessarily something of brawn, but something that quenches the thirst of those who love stories; and this was a story, afterall.  McEwan successfully breaks most rules that literary folk try to push on others, and that I thank him for, but some risky things here didn't quite work for me.  There is a slow beginning that doesn't really grab you, then comes a voice that lures you in, and gives you the endless pleasure of tasting the trappings and the intimacies of the characters.  Then it is gone, and the voice changes, and the characters are taken from you, and it becomes an effort again to keep turning the pages.  The second section snatches you away from your familiar setting, the context of a story that you had only just agreed to surrender to (something that can be good when you need to be challenged, but not when it takes you in another direction, another voice, another time, another sentiment), and you spend your time distracted, mourning the absence of the characters you took the time to get to know.  Then the third section comes up with a 'technical surprise', which you can see coming, and then you wonder about whether you will feel passion for any of the ideas behind the title, 'atonement', and you crave for some kind of conclusion, some kind of denouement, some kind of meaty substance.  It is not there though. There is cleverness and beauty in the writing, which is pleasurable in itself, but you feel let down, and you close the book not really feeling any empathy, not missing the characters, not wanting to examine the theme.  In trying to be different and challenging (or providing a challenge for himself), I feel that McEwan has indulged himself, failing to write this book with a 'reader' in mind.  Of course, it may be exactly what he had in mind!!
B0000683DH|5.0|This is a great movie! I love the original series and detest the post-TNG shows, and this movie is a perfect reminder of why the original show rocked. A great film for Trekkies and non-Trekkies, pick it up and enjoy it today. The new cut finally restores the sequences with Scotty's nephew, so it's of particular interest to any fan (casual or not) of the original show.
B00005JKZT|4.0|*Spoilers Ahead* - though being the second most read book of the 20th century, it shouldn't spoil much for many.<br />I went into the second movie with very high expectations, and I think with good reason. Peter Jackson did an amazing job with the first film, and as far as effects, the second film does not disappoint, with a couple small exceptions. The aspects that I was not as pleased with were major story changes and pacing.<br />In Fellowship, I was most irritated by Arwen's role increase, particularly as I am not a Liv Tyler fan. In Towers, there are a lot more serious changes that, I feel, dramatically alter Tolkien's work.<br />My criticism:<br />- The army of Elves does not march to Helm's Deep to help. The \\"Last Alliance of Men and Elves\\" was just that - the LAST. This is a MAJOR change. Tolkien's Elves were done interfering in the world of men.<br />- Eomer and his Riders do not come to help as late as they do - the forest moves in at dawn. That is the aid that Gandalf brings. The orcs disappear in the trees.<br />- The Ents make the decision at Entmoot to go to war. It's not the Hobbits' doing at all.<br />- Faramir is not tempted by the Ring. He does not make Frodo go to Osgiliath. He gives them provisions and helps them on their way. The point in the book is that he's the opposite of Boromir.<br />- I wish that another actor voiced Treebeard, as there is one cut that goes from Gimli to Treebeard and you can tell it's the same voice.<br />- The movie ends short of the mark. The last line in the book is \\"Frodo was alive, but taken by the enemy.\\" The movie ends before Shelob's Lair.<br />- The whole Saruman possessing King Theoden was a little over the top. I sincerely doubt Tolkien meant anything about actual spiritual possession.<br />- Frodo's fall into the Dead Marshes was a little overblown as far as the effects. It seemed amateurish compared to other effects in the films.<br />- The other effects problem I referred to earlier are the shots of Merry and Pippin walking with Treebeard; you can really tell that a blue screen was used.<br />- Gimli was made into a joke. He didn't have a serious line in the film. And did they really need to bring Dwarf-tossing back into it?<br />The good stuff:<br />- Gollum was well done. I was happy with his animation and with the personality conflict that showed through.<br />- The Nazgul steeds were also well imagined, as it's not the clearest of descriptions in the text.<br />- Lots of good Legolas action - especially the mount onto the horse - you'll see what I mean.<br />- Music was excellent. Kudos to Howard Shore yet again.<br />- Great battle sequences at Helm's Deep.<br />- There are others, but I'm much more irritated right now then impressed, so I'm not remembering them all.<br />Overall, it was good but unsettling. It starts fast, but slows, then quickens, then doesn't have a main pace. It doesn't have near the character development that the first film had - and, of course, shouldn't need it, as many have already been established. But it feels like something is missing - that connection you had with the characters in the first film just wasn't there. This is a very difficult book to adapt, and I don't begrudge them the job. I just expected it to be truer to Tolkien's vision.<br />Of course, you really must see it regardless. It's beautiful and still the best anyone's ever done with the story. I greatly look forward to the Extended DVD and Peter Jackson's explanation of these story changes.n walking with Treebeard; you can really tell that a blue screen was used. <BR>- Gimli was made into a joke. He didn't have a serious line in the film. And did they really need to bring Dwarf-tossing back into it?<br />The good stuff:<br />- Gollum was well done. I was happy with his animation and with the personality conflict that showed through. <BR>- The Nazgul steeds were also well imagined, as it's not the clearest of descriptions in the text. <BR>- Lots of good Legolas action - especially the mount onto the horse - you'll see what I mean. <BR>- Music was excellent. Kudos to Howard Shore yet again.<BR>- Great battle sequences at Helm's Deep. <BR>- There are others, but I'm much more irritated right now then impressed, so I'm not remembering them all. <br />Overall, it was good but unsettling. It starts fast, but slows, then quickens, then doesn't have a main pace. It doesn't have near the character development that the first film had - and, of course, shouldn't need it, as many have already been established. But it feels like something is missing - that connection you had with the characters in the first film just wasn't there. This is a very difficult book to adapt, and I don't begrudge them the job. I just expected it to be truer to Tolkien's vision. <br />Of course, you really must see it regardless. It's beautiful and still the best anyone's ever done with the story. I greatly look forward to the Extended DVD and Peter Jackson's explanation of these story changes.
B00005JL78|5.0|One of the strongest sci-fi films in recent year, Minority Report came out in 2002, a poster year for the genre. While (not to my surprise) the film did not gross as much as a might have been expected from a joint Spielberg-Cruise outing, the film is a thoughtful and chilling adaptation of a short story by the master Philip K. Dick, one of my favorite authors. As usual with adaptations of Dick, the film strays from the source significantly, but fortunately in the manner of films like Blade Runner, which stay true to its themes, and not like Total Recall. I largely expected this film to be a mediocre outing in the tradition of Impostor, but was pleasantly surprised.
B00005JKZT|5.0|Unlike many of the \\"reviewers\\" who wrote \\"reviews\\" BEFORE the movie was even released (How can you review something you have never seen?), I have seen the movie.  It was honestly one of the best movies that I have seen in the past few years.  I am a huge Harry Potter fan, but The Two Towers was much better than either of the Harry Potter movies, which are excellent in their own right.  I also liked it more than \\"Fellowship\\" which I loved to begin with.  There is a lot of action, but there is also charm and humor.  The characters seem to have more depth than they did in the first movie.  I also like the ending of Two Towers much more, because it kind of \\"wraps up\\" a little more instead of just ending abruptly.  I would recommend this movie to anyone, whether or not they are Tolkien fans.
B00003CX9Q|5.0|E.T. is, simply put, one of the greatest achievements in science fiction history and film history in general. No collection is complete without it, especially given the incredible quality of this transfer.
B00005JLWL|5.0|Brilliant! I am not suprised that this film did not receive much of a media push. Because of a lack of a peripheral love plot or an adherence to typical feel good formulas, this film maintains the integrity of the narrative,which has long been missing in this genre. Wimmer never diverts from the film's psychological and political statements, while still providing credible, edgy, beautiful and somewhat unique action sequences that propel the story rather than detract. The monotone atmosphere created by wadrobe,set design,and photography create a disturbing while effective backdrop,allowing contrast for the developement of the emotionally tortured cleric wonderfully yet subtly played by Christian Bale.The casting was perfect and each performance unique.If you need touchy feely; don't understand good filmmaking and you do not want to think,you should avoid this film. This is straight forward sci-fi. INSTANT CULT CLASSIC!
B00005KARK|5.0|One of the five best Disney movies, Dumbo is a magificent, heartfelt film that proves one does not require a great budget to make a great movie. Every moment of this movie -- from \\"Baby Mine\\" to Dumbo's flight -- are wonderfully crafted, absolutely beautiful, and frequently tear-jerking. \\"Pink Elephants on Parade,\\" the long, trippy animated sequence that is the bane of the collective existence of many children, is a wonderful experiment in animation to these 19-year-old eyes. <br />As a side note, the much-maligned Jim Crow sequence, while no doubt perpetuating stereotypes, casts the crows in a sympathetic light, for despite their initial playfulness, they're the only characters besides Timothy Mouse to believe in little Dumbo. Take it from me: I tend to read into the racial/sexual stereotypes in many films, but I don't find this one too offensive if taken in the proper context. The monkeys in The Jungle Book, though, are another story....

0151008116|2.0|Life of Pi proved to be a dissappointing read. I started out with promise, but it was not particularly well written and, in fact, came off as Salman Rushdie light. The author broached some interesting emotional and spiritual themes, but failed to carry them throughout the plot. After following Pi's struggle for survival, I wished for greater resolution and meaning in the end.
B000002Q7Y|5.0|Bottom line...I never realized how much Kansas and the Dixie Dregs had in common, until I heard the Dregs!  With that said, Power was my 1st introduction to Steve Morse's guitar playing and he was phenominal with this band. I thought his style worked perfectly. I never missed the violins. This CD and IN THE SPIRIT OF THINGS were both majorly under-rated. And if you like music like Kansas, then check out the Dixie Dregs...it's instrumental Kansas WITH Violins!!!
B00004SAJK|4.0|Regular readers here know I love UFO. I have a lot of cd's by this band. I put on Mechanix today, having not listened to it in a few years. The result- it rocks! This was, for me, the last truly excellent UFO result until 1995's Walk on Water- a period of 13 rather spotty years marked by myriad personnel changes.<BR>Paul Chapman is truly the star here. He shreds through standouts like The Writer and We Belong To the Night,Something Else, and <BR>shows versatility on ballads like Terri and Back into my Life.<BR>UFO definitely tried to be more radio-friendly on Mechanix, and<BR>Back into my Life charted here. Listen to this album for Andy Parker's drumming alone- see how he propels and drives every song. Feel It is a stomper where Parker,Mogg,and Chapman shine.<BR>Pete way rides Bass right up the middle, and Neil (never really a UFO member to me) Carter chips in here and there.<BR>Making Contact was next, and that's when things began to cloud over on UFO's horizon. A punchy,well produced set of songs, Mechanix doesn't disappoint. Give it a re-listen. LOUD!
B00003CXXP|1.0|I hadn't rented a DVD in over a year, and unfortunately chose this one.  Technically flawless, but a perfect example of a Hollywood director/writer coming up with what seems like a promising idea, and then not knowing what to do with it.  A wandering, meandering mess.  I think the saddest part of the whole thing is those who will rave about it just because it's Spielberg, without looking at it objectively to see how awful it really is.
0767817478|5.0|It's been almost five years since this film came out back in 1998. I can remember the very first TV Spot on television around New Years. As a HUGE Godzilla fan I was excited to say the least. And I must tell you, when I saw it when it finally came out I wasn't dissapointed, and to this day I still feel the same way.<br />It's a darn shame that this film gets blasted like it does. It shows me that the majority of the people (and Godzilla fans) that take the time to write reviews for films probably don't know what they are talking about when they talk of America's &quot;Godzilla&quot;.<br />There are a couple of main issues critics and Godzilla fans have with the film. The story and the monster itself, 'Godzilla'.<br />If you look back at all of the original Japanese Godzilla flicks, you aren't going to find a great (not to mention BELIEVABLE) story or plot. I realize this, even being a fan of all things Godzilla. Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich's 'Godzilla' atleast, in my opinion, had the audience believing what was going on up on the screen. And if the story was slightly dull to some of you, you should let it pass. Remember what 'Godzilla' is about, afterall.<br />And what was wrong with the monster itself, Godzilla? Nothing. If you get two action figures, one being a model of the original Godzilla from the Japanese series and a model of the new American Godzilla you will find differences but both are remarkably alike in alot of ways. They both have the spikes, gigantic size, and famous roar. The major differences being the skin color, face, and longer legs. I loath it when people bring up how they shouldn't have changed Godzilla's looks. I mean, I love the old Godzilla look, it may be silly to some, but to me it's still cool. But it would NOT have worked for this film at ALL. If they had made the American version with a creature that had big 'googily' eyes and flying around on his tail kicking monsters, it would have ended up being a laugh-fest at the theaters.<br/>What the American 'Godzilla' brings us is a believable monster that has the spirit and characteristics of the original, that satisfies the audience. It was just more realistic. Shouldn't we have expected that? Devlin and Emmerich came up with a monster that was realistic. Something the creators of the original attempted at doing but were limited to rubber suits. Something the Japanese audience accepts, but the American audience will not. It's sad that most Godzilla fans and critics do not understand this.<br />I personally believe that the majority of the general audience ENJOYED this film. It's just the critical blasting from G Fans and Critics that got alot of attention, unfortunately, and therefore this gets labeled as a 'bad' film. It's sad really that people can't enjoy this film.<br />This is one of my favorite DVD's to plug in. It's Big, Loud, and Fun. And although we've had lots of great films with tons of Special Effects, there's nothing quite like it.<br />So take a look at it, be open and I'm sure you will enjoy the fantastic pop-corn entertainment known as &quot;GODZILLA&quot;.
0151008116|5.0|Some people have criticised the book and the author for being a bit bold in stating that the story could make you believe in God.  I have read reviews that stated that while the story did  make certain readers sympathize for Pi and marvel in his tale, they wernt convinced of the whole God thing.  This is a definate error in logic.<br />First off, I am NOT  a religious person.  However, this story is written in a manner that  you either accept  version A or version B (if you have read you know what I am talking about. if not, dont worry it will not ruin the journey).  <br />If you accept, or at least hope to beleive in, version A, (which I am sure you have or will after reading), then logically, you should believe in a God of some sort.  Your acceptence of v. A is no different than if you were to believe in the New Testament or the Koran or what have you<br />The reason is simple.  The storys point is that of faith, not religion, so do not be turned off by what I am saying.  Its more of a spirtiutal thing and a lesson in logic and faith. <br /> It gives you options, it leaves the ball in your court.  If you believe in A, then it would not be logically sound  for you to reject in God.  Your logic would be flawed.  Version A and God are the same thing in a way.<br />Not being religious, this was an intersting way for it to be pointed out to me.  The story is more of a trick really,  Like a Socratic dialectic.   You believe in &quot;something A&quot; at first, but after answering certain logical questions posed in carefully constructed  ways, you end up realizing that only the opposite of what you believed can be true.<br />Anyway, the point is, the statement in the inside flap is not audacious.  Its actually the whole metaphor of the book.  Read it and then ask yourself this: &quot;Am I logically flawed for not believing in God&quot;
B00005JKZT|4.0|I loved the movie.  I've seen it twice already.  The scenery is spectacular bringing me right into Middle Earth!  Gollem is the best digital character I've ever seen!!  Gollem deserves an Oscar!  Treebeard and the forest is awesome.  Music is great.  <BR>My only two complaints are as follows:<br /> 1)  Aragorn is more confident in the book.  In the movie he seems unsure of himself and more full of self-doubt than he does in the book. Love Viggo, but he's supposed to be almost arrogant, but magnanimous, at times in the books, he's Stryder after all!!<br />2) Boo hiss to the portrayel of Eowyn!  She was brave and courageous in the book and the movie portrays her like some swooning lovesick girl and barely touches on her tremendous bravery and courage!   She wanted to FIGHT in the book.  The movie makes her seem like she can't decide what dress to wear.  She should have been portrayed more like her brother was.
0201633612|5.0|This is an excellent book which teaches more than a few gems of software development and design. Developing to interfaces to be independent of implementation, favouring composition over inheritance, and the art of delegation are but a few.<br />The design patterns themselves are awesome and they take a while to sink in. I would be surprised if you could read through the book once from cover-to-cover and understand when and where each design pattern could be used. The authors give some good examples, but you really need to USE the design patterns to fully appreciate them. But, bear with it, this is a book worth studying! Study each design pattern, apply them, be enlightened.<br />One thing that struck me is that many of the patterns are similar and overlapping. They are not as distinct as one might originally think. In fact, it has become clear that the majority of patterns consist of composition and delegation, DELEGATION being the key concept. Understand and learn the art of delegation and you will become a better designer of design patterns. Understand the art of design patterns and you will become a better designer of software.<br />A truly excellent book that facilitates knowledge transfer of software design best practices. The beauty of this book is that it has probably contributed more to the adoption and spread of the software design pattern paradigm than the actual design patterns themselves. Bravo! We are all better off for it.

0449215644|5.0|Mary Stewart's Ivy Tree got me hooked on reading and I've read every book she's written.  The villain in this book is so memorable I have always remembered his name.  This book like all of her books marries romance and mystery but in a way no modern books do, it is romance, not sex.  All of her books give you information on either classic works or other historic backgrounds, like the Spanish Riding School, that I got big points from my Humanities teachers from things I learned from Mary Stewart, I never told them how I knew the information.  This is one of her best, the people are memorable and the horse is miraculous.  Just a treat all round.  Read all her mysteries you can't go wrong
B000069CWE|5.0|I consider myself not to be an individual thats taste lie within in mainstream music.  With that said, i have to express my upmost appreciation for this album.  Showing that there is more to them than baring the label of standard rap/rock fare, they have encorperated many well respected emcees and rock artists.  frg/10, feat. charli 2na of jurrassic 5 fame, has to be one of my favorite tracks, as it's not only completely different than it's hybrid theory counterpart, but captures an essense of the underground hip hop.  My delight was furthered to find tracks with Defari, Aceyalone, Evidence, Pharoehe Monch, and many other guest appearances.  <BR>If your not a big fan of rap music but enjoyed hybrid theory, i would not reccommend this album as most of the tracks have more rap/techno than rock/techno when compared to their last effort.  However, if you are curious about what underground rap has to offer, this is a great example, especially high voltage, produced by evidence and mixed by DJ Babu.<BR>  Mike Shinoda still shows his promising lyrical abilities, and really it almost feels like it's more his own LP than Linkin Park's.  To some though, that may be a good thing.  I highly reccommend this to lovers of music, even to those who didn't find hybrid theory to be their cup of tea.
B00005JL78|2.0|This could have been a great movie.  Unfortunately, the place in the movie that should have been the end of the movie was, in fact, just another place in the movie.  The real ending, which occurs much later, is a predictable disappointment.
B00005JKZT|4.0|I'm going to try to keep this review short and simple. First off I'd like to say that \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" was one of the greatest movies ever made. Now on to the \\"Two Towers.\\" This must of been a difficult script to write because there is no beginning or an end. Which at times unfortunately makes this movie seem like filler or at least a bridge between the 1st and the 3rd movie. It should be pointed out, the story and emotion of this film plays second to the fight scences. Is that good or bad, well thats up to each individual. There is a fair amount of comic relief from Gimli which I wasn't too fond of. Comic relief should play its part but not through Gimli. His character seems too much of a departure than that of The Fellowship. And one more small gripe. Even though the Battle at Helms Deep was great I thought it just lacked something. The battle was visually stunning like the entire film however the actual swordplay could of been better.<br />As far as the good things go. Well that is just too much to name. But the most enjoyable part of the movie was that of Gollum. The most brilliantly created CG character ever made! Something you just have to see to believe. George Lucas should be taking notes. Despite the very few minor complaints, I love this movie and can't wait for the DVD to come out.
0312265859|4.0|The characters in this book are the same familiar ones we have learned to love ( or hate ) but the writing is a little crisper and the movement from scene to improbable scene just a little less jerky than in the first few. I will look for Book Nine at the library....
B00005JKZT|4.0|O.K so where do I start?<br />First the good <br />The cinematography was-Excellent it takes you and draws you into this world of Middle Earth, that in and of itself is stunning and it deserves that oscar at the very least(but will not get it if last year is any indication of things to come)<br />The acting from all quarters was very good I particularly liked Orlando Bloom and Vorg(Aragon) these two performed the best in making their characters come alive. Everyone else did a very good job but these are the performances that stand out <br />The Ents-Providing some very good comic relief in this movie are the tree shepherds the oldest of whom \\"Treebeard\\" is the oldest living thing under the sun in Middle Earth.  The ents also look really cool and if you witness nothing else in this movie you should see part where the Ents smack the .... out of Isenguard (the wizard Saurman's stronghold)<br />Gollum-Hats off to the guy that was cast to fill this role, just like I always pictured him <br />Helms Deep-The set is just really good looking you have to see the movie in order to judge for yourself <br />Now the bad <br />O.K first le me say this I am not a Tolken literalist but the book got totally chopped up an diced, not that I mind some of the new parts were good.  I just had to endure the moaning and whining of all the literalists at the theater.  <br />The Character of John Ryees Davis played a little too heavy on the comic relife aspect of the movie, it got annoying(not that most of it wasn't funny) <br />The ending-As in the last one there was no end.  Let me clarify (I'm talking to people who have read the book right now).  Guys we know how it ends but what is John Q. Public who is just there for a night of escape supposed to think?  I mean it just stops!  Jackson could have done a little better with that particular aspect of the movie <br />My overall impression-I loved this movie I really Good Special Effects although it was a little slow at times.  An all round good movie

A fine product of the Tyrell Corporation.  \\"More human than human.\\"<br /><br />LA, in the early 21st century, when old, abused, and greenhouse gassed Earth is inhabited only by the [humans] who can't make it off-world, or the decadents who revel in the multi-culti fin-de-cycle atmosphere of a depopulated city, six replicants - genetically designed slaves with a short lifespan - have arrived to meet their maker and be granted an extension to their lives.<br /><br />Harrison Ford plays Deckard, a cop who specializes in spotting and 'retiring' rogue replicants.  He must find the surviving four skinjobs and air 'em out.  But who is Deckard?  Why is Dr. Tyrell so callous about creating life designed for enslavement?  Is it because he's seen every inch of a human under the most microscopic detail and he has never come across the soul?  Perhaps he felt different after his talk with the prodigal son, Roy Batty, who defied incredible odds to meet his father.<br /><br />The performances in this movie were outstanding.  Rutger Hauer will always be Roy Batty for me.  Incredibly tough, enigmatic, brilliant, and dangerous.  The star list in this movie is awesome.  A great collection of A-list actors, and plenty from the B-list who do a A-list job.  One cool actor was Joe Turkel, who I've only seen in two other movies: Paths of Glory and The Shining, where he played the ghostly bartender Loyd.

B000006TRV|4.0|The Wall has been described as one of the greatest albums of all time and a roadmap to suicide. These two facts hold true on Floyd's '79 effort; one of the darkest most influential albums ever. From the haunting vocals on Another Brick in the Wall all parts to the funky slide guitar on young lust (the album's only upbeat happy effort and it rocks!) to the rhythm guitar on Run Like Hell this album flat out rocks. Buy it if your new to Floyd and the whole depressing aspect doesnt bother you. If it does bother you and your new to Floyd pick up Dark Side of the Moon or Wish you were Here which are definently on par with the Wall.<br />&quot;...all in all your just another brick in the wall...&quot;
0451196716|3.0|Before you even read this book, you'd never guess what it was about.  The first time it happened, I had to read it again just to be sure I read it correctly.  It's not a horror by any means and it's not even a thriller.  The book is very repetitive but for some reason, not boring.<br />Once again though, I'm confused with the ending.  This is the third Stephen King book I've read where the ending doesn't make sense and I feel cheated.<br />Overall, it was a decent book although I don't know I'd recommend it to many people.

B00007E8JP|5.0|When I first became a SOAD fan, I bought Toxicity first. It was a great album so then I tried their 1998 debut release, and I was exposed to their deep inner self. Then I got this new album and I must say that System has again enthralled me. Each song may start out similar but, once things get going, they are all genuine in themselves.<br />Chic 'N' Stu - Weird song with a catchy chorus. What a splendid pie!! Pizza pizza pie!! I don't know what Serj is blathering about but I like it heh<br />Innervision - My sister was the first to tell me about this and I downloaded it. It seemed amazing when it was the only song I'd heard but, when I bought the whole CD, it was left in the dust as the melodic tunes of every other track began to catch my interest more<br />Bubbles - Short and sweet. This one didn't seem to get much hype but it was awesome though. It's not deep or dark. It's just fun and energetic<br />Boom! - Serj really managed to prevail in this song with his monotonous tone of voice in the beginning as the wild music is playing in the background. The chorus is nothing too special though<br />Nuguns - This is probably the song I've given the least amount of listens to even though it is quite good<br />A.D.D. - The three letters stand for American Dream Denial. I love the chorus to this one. It's one of my favorites<br />Mr. Jack - I just caught on to this song today. It's the longest track and yet it's only over four minutes<br />I-E-A-I-A-I-O - System seems to do good at choruses. And this one is enchanting. And we light up the skyyy...<br />36 - The song is called 36 but it's 46 seconds long. Cool music but the message seems to oppress television<br />Pictures - The music in this one rocks. And I love it when Daron jumps in at the end and repeats Serj's every phrase in a scream. Away (away!) gold dust (gold dust!)<br />Highway Song - I didn't pay much attention to this at first. But it's really melodic so I caught on fast<br />**** the System - It's alright. Nothing to put too much attention to<br />Ego Brain - System unleashes their soft side. The opening music sounds like the song Toxicity but everything quickly changes. The music, the flow, the message, it's all done perfectly in this track<br />Thetawaves - It starts out mediocre but as soon as you hear the chorus (Time feels like a midnight ride, finality waits outside, weeping in perplexity's arms, caressing our smiles inside) then you will be hooked<br />Roulette - Very calm, very soothing. This is not like normal System and that's what I like about it. They're trying to bring out different kinds of music<br />Streamline - This one was released as an extra by itself and debuted on the movie Scorpion King. I remember downloading it last summer and it's still good

I think I've finally hit the point where otherwise pretty good albums will be dissapointing when you first hear them just because you have so many other albums of theirs that are better, because that's exactly what happened here. <BR>  <BR>That said, I don't find it nearly as bad as it's detractors do, or quite as good as the cult fandom it apparently grew does, but it's a neat little album, and pretty good work for a band that seemed to still be reeling from the loss of it's original lead singer and songwriter. The title track is a bizarre mess in the best kind of way, \\"Allan's Psychadelic Breakfast\\" is just a bizarre mess (albeit with some neat moments here and there), and the 3 songs in between are fair to pretty good. So while it's probably not the most essential pink floyd album you could buy, it's worthy of picking up sometime or other. Come for \\"Atom Heart Mother Suite\\", stay for \\"fat old sun\\", the definitive picture of a cow, and recipes for a Bedouin wedding feast and cow brains.
B00005JLS0|4.0|I've never been a fan of either Sandra Bullock or Hugh Grant, but this movie has changed my mind about both.  Hugh Grant is knee slapping funny and Sandra Bullock plays along excellently.  The first half of the movie had me doubled over laughing.  It got a little slow in the second half when their romance bloomed and things got a bit predictable.  This one's a great \\"Chick Flick\\", but enough humor that the guys won't be too bored.
B00005A1PR|5.0|India Arie's debut effort is a mellow but powerful blend of folk, R&amp;B, and soul. I received this particular disc for my birthday in November and found that it took me a while to really catch the fever and understand why everyone was raving about this album. On a first listen many of the tracks sound the same, but the more you listen the more the real gems begin to stand out. Like most, I was drawn in by the single, \\"Video\\" and am glad to finally say that there are many cuts that are just as good, if not better, than the first single. A few standouts include:<br />\\"Strength, Courage, &amp; Wisdom\\" is a funky, uplifting, mid-tempo contemplation on, surprise, strength, courage, and wisdom.<BR>\\"I See God in You\\" is another mid-tempo cut that discusses the worth of another person and all the good qualities they possess, allowing her to see their godlike nature. Arie's voice is superb and soulful on this cut. <BR>\\"Ready for Love\\" is the most powerful song on the album. It's a very simple, acoustic ballad in which Arie grieves over a lack of love and wonders why it has evaded her for so long. It's really a touching, haunting song and the best of the best, in my opinion. <BR>Another charming highlight is the Interlude in the middle of the album. Arie lists a great number of her influences like Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald, Miles Davis, Charlie Patton, and others. Arie and her guitar are excellent in their heartfelt simplicity.<br />This is a great album, and I think India Arie will be around for a very long time. It promises to appeal to a large audience and stretches across numerous genres. I urge you, even if you have some doubts, pick up this album and give it a go.
B00005UEAR|5.0|This recording is amazing.  It's full of varied textures, heavy grooves, beautifully orchestrated and dramatic symphonic compositions, layered complex melodies and out-of-this-world musicianship.  Like all Dream Theater it is complex, so it takes a few listens for it to \\"sink in\\" before you're able to fully follow everything that's going on and really grasp the threads that are started, embellished and resolved.  This is music that requires (and commands!) your full attention to be appreciated--open your mind and ears and be richly rewarded.  An absolute must for musicians for its interesting and complex compositions as well as virtuosic performances.  BTW, if you like Dream Theater check out Liquid Tension Experiment and Greg Howe.
B00005QZWI|5.0|The 5 star rating says it all!!  If I could put 6 stars I most definitely would!!! Mr. shore did an excellent job with this soundtrack.  I have listened to it countless number of times since I bought it a year ago and I am still not sick of it!<BR>Just buy it you won't regret it!!!
0800130952|4.0|Matilda is worth watching, and I think worth owning too.  However, let's get the reservations over before all the good stuff.<br />Miss Trunchbull, played by Pam Ferris, is a sadist.  She is definitely mean.  At two places in the movie she throws a child out a school window (she is really, really mean).  Matilda's parents are self-absorbed and at best ignore Matilda, which occasionally borders on abuse.  The images of Matilda's school can be disturbing, especially the \\"Chokie\\", a small cramped dark closet with spikes in the door.  These images could be disturbing for younger children, particularly those under the age of 7 or 8.  However, you have to judge the ability of your child to understand that these images are not real.  These are the dark parts of the movie.<br />Matilda is clearly a genius, as evidenced by her actions from a very early age.  Matilda overcomes her not very bright parents and learns how to fend for herself in the world.  In fact, after a while she treats her parents as something to be concerned about, because they clearly do not know how to take care of themselves in the world.<br />Matilda is a positive role model throughout the movie.  She learns to read on her own, and finds the value in the library and books.  She learns that there are people who understand her (Miss Jennifer Honey, played by Embeth Davidtz) and love her for who she is.  She also learns that people who seem scary to her (Miss Trunchbull) can be scary to others.  Her desire to protect others and do what is right helps her overcome her fear of Miss Trunchbull and do what is right.<br />Mara Wilson plays Matilda very well.  She has a lot of talent, and makes Matilda come alive.  Danny De Vito plays Matilda's father and Rhea Perlman plays Matilda's mother, and every time I see them I cringe because these two are very unlikable characters, and I like Danny particularly.  Danny also does a very good job narrating this movie, which somewhat ameliorates his turn as a semi-villain.<br />This movie celebrates, as it does in most Roald Dahl books, the triumph of right over wrong, and perhaps good over evil.  The characters verge on being cartoonish, which is fitting for a children's movie.  Having Matilda be telekinetic adds a wonderful element of fantasy with which children will identify.  It is often a childhood fantasy to have powers or abilities to make things right, and Matilda obtains such a power and uses it for good.<br />This movie has a darker side, but the humorous moments and the Matilda's triumph over all the odds against her make this a fun movie.  Worth watching again and again, I think this movie is well targeted to 8 to 12 year olds, but those of us adults that want to still believe that good will always triumph over bad and that good things eventually come to good people will find the message uplifting.<br />This movie celebrates, as it does in most Roald Dahl books, the triumph of right over wrong, and perhaps good over evil.

0671015206|2.0|I was given this book as a gift and was thoroughly disappointed. This book simply states that you should live below your means, stay out of debt and save money, if you want to be a millionaire. Shocking! The statistical data shows that most millionaires don't live in fancy houses, drive fancy cars, belong to country clubs or eat out a lot. True. Most millionaires are people nearing retirement with large 401(k)s/pensions and houses that have appreciated significantly in value. In order to take advantage of this savings, they'll need to sell their homes and begin to liquidate their 401(k)s. In other words, they will be living off this money as retirees. They will not be dining on caviar and champagne every night nor living on a $500,000 yacht. They will need every dime in this high priced world. In other words, they will not be rich . . . and let's face it, people are buying this book because they want to know how to \\"get rich\\" not how to have a safe retirement. I suppose a better title for this book should have been: \\"A safe retirement is within reach for someone with fiscal discipline\\". Boring and obvious advice.
052594527X|4.0|Girl With A Pearl Earring, by Tracy Chevalier is the story of a maid, &quot;Griet,&quot; and her work with the vamous painter Vermeer.  Her duties as a maid expand to assisting Vermeer -- not &quot;acceptable for a maid&quot; -- and Vermeer's art is not supposed to be of maids. Yet they overcome class differences, and we are brought into a painting which comes to life the minute the first page is read. In the following pages, Chavelier paints a slow, yet careful and beautiful work of art that makes the 17th century timeless. For an artist's eyes and the &quot;wide eyed maid&quot; exchange pearls of wisdom.  The story is as beautiful and complete as a tightly strung pearl necklace.  Pearls may look white, but looks can be deceiving. The story of this work of art creates an illusion that satisfies the readers' eyes.
B000024D4R|5.0|Man what can be said here that hasnt already been stated a thousand times about the Floyd....<br />they have their own style of music... FLOYD MUSIC.<br />Im not one oF those anal people who say the only good music was written in the past but nowadays their just isnt any real thought and creative energy out there making anything new unique and exciting,\\"at least not on this level\\" and thats what makes listening to this one so sweet... I somtimes enjoy the taste of metal but latley I have been a floydarian. GO FLOYDARIAN!!!
B00006LLJ4|5.0|I wandered into a theatre last July 2002, and enjoyed a spectacular treat: one of my favorite Sci-Fi authors (Phillip K. Dick) coupled with one of my favorite directors (Steven Spielberg). I was completely unaware of the production of this film, and was caught off-guard by the grainy, melting 20th Century Fox intro (\\"What is this?\\", I wondered, \\"Some kind of 20th generation print?\\").<br />The film is grainy and the effect is completely surreal, and the director took a real chance going ahead with it. But the effect sets the film right into the cheap, metallic, totalitarian scenario it belongs. It gives the impression that there is something very wrong going on, and there is!<br />Put this film on the shelf with the Sci-Fi greats like \\"The Day The Earth Stood Still\\", \\"Forbidden Planet\\", \\"2001\\" and \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" (hmmm, I think I just put \\"12 Monkeys\\" there too). It contains a clear warning of what we could become, and the delivery of the message is just beautiful.
B000069CWE|4.0|Great remix CD (I especially liked the awesome Forgotten), but LP needs some more new songs. High voltage and My December are pretty good, but they just don't stack up to most of the other stuff on Hybrid Theory. That being said, It's still really good and I urge any LP fan to at least listen to it before dismissing it as a cashgrab.
0066214122|3.0|Before I read the first page of the Prologue, I resigned myself to reading technical material on nanotechnology, willy-nilly, like it or not.  Michael Crichton, along with Mary Poppins, is a firm believer that a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down.  The \\"sugar\\" being the characters and story line.<br />Actually, the disinterested wife fascinated me right up to the finish line.  For this, I was pleased.  The story is formulaic: doomed scientists frantically searching for the key to destroy the monster before the monster destroys them (and the world).  This monster is only impressive in numbers, not size.  Microscopic computer chips programmed to be an \\"eye in the sky\\" for defense purposes.  Individually, they are dumb; put a few billion together and they evolve very quickly.<br />Because these chips have been formulated in a hunter/prey mode, there are certain short-term defenses that can be taken.  When a group of scientists is threatened, one smart fellow yells \\"Flock!\\" I confess I would have been struck dead right there, for I haven't the first notion of how one \\"flocks.\\"  It turns out they were to march in step together taking up the most amount of room possible making the swarm think they were facing a huge entity (until said swarm figured it all out, that is.)<br />Mostly I enjoyed the book and had a small glow of self-satisfaction because I had plowed through the technical pages per Mr. Crichton's wishes.  I can't help but think it will be a very silly movie, but I suppose a movie it will be, as I believe it is written into MC's contract before he even takes pen to paper.  I suggest waiting for the paperback, unless you are a die hard Crichton fan.
B00006RU5B|4.0|This CD is just awesome...I was a huge RATM and Soundgarden fan and was pleased to see Chris, Tim, Brad and Tom form this incredible force that is now Audioslave...When you buy this record, youll get an unbelievable blend of talents that resulted in the best hard rock band (and record) in the music scene today...An absolute must-have in your collection.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|If you've followed the success of these girls (as I have) then you've probably been waiting for this release since May.  Whether or not it is worth the wait, who knows.  The songs are basically American-ized/commericalized versions of the original Russian songs.  The songs are much easier to listen to in English, and &quot;Not Gonna Get Us&quot; and &quot;Show Me Love&quot; are improvements over the original.  The highlight of the CD has to be &quot;How Soon Is Now?&quot;  It is definitely the best song I've heard from Julia and Lena, Russian or English.  Plus, the video footage of them is worth the price alone.  If you've got a thing for teenage Russian lesbians...well, then chances are you probably already own this.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|This is a wonderful movie for those who truely love historical romance and/ or Jane Austen!  I recommend it whole heartedly.
B00005JKZT|5.0|man oh man, i'm still a little dazed from the movie. after sitting in a movie theater for three hours for this movie, the only thing i wanna do is see it again. everything about it was amazing, right down to Gollum's facial expressions. and i'm sure this is going to be in every review, but the battle at Helm's Deep was the greatest battle scene ever. more intense than the battles in Braveheart and more visually stunning than the arena battle in Star Wars Episode II. my only complaints are as follows:  Theoden's degeneration was a little overdone. he looked more like a corpse than a feeble old man. as always, i didn't much care for Liv Tyler, but that's not the movie's fault so much as her father's. and i didn't appreciate the direction they had Faramir going until right near the end. Faramir was supposed to be the more honorable, wiser brother, which i guess he was in the end. aside from that, the movie was done even better than the first, and it's looking like the third will be even better. i'm counting the days already. this movie is more than worth the $8 and sore neck. i'm gonna do it again and again, i think, probably until X-2 in May.
B00006RCNW|2.0|I must admit I was not blown away by this show. I watched about the first 3-4 episodes when they first aired, and pretty much thought this show was awful. To me the characters talked in nothing but cliches, and awful \\"tough guy talk.\\" Here are some examples of what I remember (some quotes might not be exact):<BR>\\"I won't listen to you and neither will my men. Not today. Not ever. Not even on El Cinco De Mayo.\\"<BR>\\"I'm not the good cop, and I'm not the bad cop. I'm a different kind of cop.\\"<BR>Granted both of those lines came from the same character in the same episode, but that is all I remember. If it wasn't for Clark Johnson's brilliant direction of the first episode, I would not have bothered watching any of the other episodes. For my money I'll stick with reruns of Homicide on CourtTV.
0060989157|5.0|I have always struggled to read.  It takes me months to read a book half the length of this one.  THIS book I finished in less than five days!  It's that much fun!<br />The first time I heard 'Shout at The Devil' at a friend's house, 17 years ago, I was hooked for life.  I have to stress that you don't need to be a fan of the band to enjoy this book. It's just a really entertaining ride.  The chapters by Mick are hysterical! The way that each tale is told from four (and sometimes more) points of view is clever and keeps you turning pages, wondering what the other sides to the stories are.<br />(...)  <br />This book is a great gift for anyone who has ever dreamt of the Rock-n-Roll lifestyle.  I only wish ALL books were this entertaining.  I'd cut off my cable and stop seeing movies!
B00006YXEK|5.0|I love this CD. But then again I love anything that George Harrison did. I love Jeff Lynne's production on anything. Some people think he is too overbearing on Harrison's music. I disagree. ELO rules and so does this! Buy this album, you won't regret it.
0783241569|4.0|I first saw this movie on tv and loved it after looking in stors I finaly found a copy. This is a cute mivie about finding your true love. It had a funny cast and Hugh Grant is wonderful in this movie. I think its his best yet. Julia Roberts is all right in this movie but it is manely about Hugh.
0451207521|4.0|Actually this is the first of Ken Follett's book that I read. I just couldn't put it down.<br />It's ashame that the story is a bit short, and but it served as a wonderful reading material for a short weekend break!<br />I getting some more of Follett.....
B000069CWE|5.0|I know a lot of people think that this album ..... and/or isn't worth your money, but I think it's just as good, if not better than Hybrid Theory. Unlike most remixes and remix albums, most of these aren't just slightly altered versions of the originals. When I first heard of Linkin Park, I heard they were kind of like Nine Inch Nails. At the time I didn't agree, but now I definitely do agree, as some of these tracks are industrial-ish (One Step Closer, Pushing Me Away, My December). There are also some hip-hop songs (In The End, High Voltage). There are even some songs where Pheonix plays cello and violin (Intermission/Papercut, Crawling). Although a few of the new versions sound a bit pointless (Points of Authority, With You), and the new vocals aren't always needed, this is worth every penny. I can't praise this album enough.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|This new CD is awesome! These two girls are totally rockin! I am totally addicted to their new CD! They have this strange edge to them that makes ya love 'em. You definately have to buy this CD and experience it! t.A.T.u is gonna make it big!!!
B000003N7K|5.0|Lush, beautiful, romantic. It is pretty hard not to be turned on by this evocative work. Johnny Hartman never sounded so good, beautifully playing off Coltrane. As far as I know, this was the only time someone sang with Coltrane's legendary quartet. It brought Hartman back into the limelight. One senses a lot of love in this recording, both for music and each other. While not the greatest work of Coltrane, this CD wonderfully showcases Hartman's vocal gifts.
006016848X|4.0|This is a must hear audiobook. It offers very clear understanding to male and female mentality. Women, if you want to understand men, then you should listen to Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus by John Gray. This audiobook is also quite entertaining.
B00005V9HA|5.0|This movie was quite a shocker back in 1985 when it was originally released. It's a great film with a  talented cast. Jeffrey Combs, Bruce Abbott(Bad Dreams 1988),and Barbara Crampton work well together and make the bizarre events going on around them believable. The Milleniumn edition DVD is packed with extra features including interviews with the director, the screenwriter and the music composer. I highly recommend it, if you love horror films you simply must add Re-Animator to your video collection.It's a splatterfest filled with humor.
B00005JKJA|5.0|Trying to explain the &quot;plot&quot; of this film is missing the point.  Mulholland Drive is the best anyone's ever come at translating a dream (or nightmare) to film.  It perfectly captures the surreal quality, disjointed logic, and manic fright of a feverish dream.  Like Lynch's other classic Blue Velvet, this movie isn't meant to be explained so much as it's meant to be FELT.  Like all great art, Mullholand Drive will have a definite impact on you, even if you don't quite understand it - in much the same way a great painting or piece of music has a profound effect on us, even when we can't articulate the reason.<br />This is truly a classic, a film that you'll remember long after you've seen it.  After watching Mulholland Drive, you'll have the same uneasy, disoriented feeling you get when you first wake up from a particularly frightening dream.  David Lynch is a true artist, and Mulholland Drive is his crowning achievement.
6304457383|4.0|As a blind woman terrorized by a trio of drug thugs, Audrey Hepburn is still a vision of unequaled class and beauty. But her raw acting talent is showcased here, and the ingenuity of her character, despite her blindness, in outwitting her victimizers makes for a taunt, psychological thriller that even now, more than 35 years after its release in 1967, is a timeless nail-biter. All the action centers in the basement apartment Hepburn's character of Suzy shares with her husband, photographer Efrem Zimbalist Jr. With him gone on a shooting assignment, enter alleged good guy Richard Crenna who actually turns out to be a baddie but does redeem himself when he finally figures out he's been out-classed and out-witted by a blind lady. But it is the talented Alan Arkin's turn as the ringleader who elevates evil to an art form. And it is sheerly delightful to watch him get his in the nail-biting finale, and we're left giving Suzy the high-five. The reason for the bad guys going after the supposedly helpless blind lady? She's got a doll that she doesn't know has a stach of heroine sewed into it. Drugs, even then! Tragically, they're one of the reasons this film is timeless. But it's the genius of Hepburn's character that is the must-see here.
B00005JLWL|4.0|This is one of those rare films that manage to reach for the sky and just as you think it will fall miserably, it comes back with a vengence.  I didn't hear much about this film when i went in, just a short clip on TV and that amazing scene when Preston jumps through the door in the beginning.  I wasn't sure what to expect, though i heard it combined 1984, Brave New World, Farenheit 451 AND The Matrix.  It does, with surprising results.  I won't give a blow by blow of film but suffice it to say it is about a devout believer turning heretic.  You can figure out how that links to everything once you see the film.  The greatest thing about this film is, hands down, the action.  No one has done gunfights, at least to my knowledge, that even closely resemble this.  It like taking an anime character and making him real.  Some of the parts were somewhat derivative (::cough:: can you say lobby scene?) but even that had its own flare unmatched even by The Matrix.  But is it better?  I really can't say it was.  While there was a much more pertinant and deeper message, the delivery was often times stale and stilted.  It took to much from 1984 and not enough from farenheit 451 in this instance, as the propaganda soon starts to wear on you.  The acting was superb (you try repressing your emotions and see how easy it is to act) and the sets and props were great for what small budget the filmmakers had.  This was an artsy film, definitely not following in big budget footsteps.  I applaud the director for steering clear of the cliche and overused, though I don't care for all the decisions he made.  Would I recommend it?  With reservation.  Go see it if your an action fan with patience, or if you go in with a very open mind.
0792842073|4.0|Director Tim Robbins' adaption of Sister Helen Prejean's book of her own denunciation of capital punishment is a probing and intelligent analysis of whether capital punishment serves or denies justice in a society where support for the death penalty hovers near the 80 percent mark. The complexities of the hotly debated issues that make up the pros and cons of state-sanctioned death are posited here, and the film doesn't come up with any clear answer one way or the other. But \\"Dead Man Walking\\" doesn't set out to answer that question. Instead, it focuses on one condemned murderer's unsteady walk to a gurney where he is to meet his final judgment and how one woman helps him accept responsibility for his guilt and accept his fate with the help of the faith she nurtures in him. Susan Sarandon nailed a Best Actress Oscar for her sensitive but practical portrayal of the nun who turns spiritual advisor to Sean Penn's condemned character. Looking every bit like someone capable of murder, Penn basks in one of the best performances of his career in an Oscar-nominated tour de force, and the unlikely Sarandon-Penn combination is subtly electrifying. In the end, director Robbins may be asking us to reassess our own position on capital punishment, and his film is a provocative and educational tool to use in starting that re-examination.
6300274195|5.0|This movie is really short. Dumbo runs 1 hour and 3 minutes. Walt Disney's 3rd animated movie. Is Dumbo's name supposed to be Jumbo Jr? Yes, Dumbo is the elphant with his ears sticking out and soon we see a mouse named Timothy Mouse. Dumbo (or Jumbo JR) is not the favorite among the other elephants expect his mom Mrs. Jumbo. But when trouble happpens, and Mrs. Jumbo is out of control trying to protect her baby, she ends up in an empty car with a sign that says &quot;Mad Elphant&quot;. But she doesn't look mad. She looks sad. I own this movie on video. But I can't remember how I got two video tapes of this movie and when I got both tapes. Great movie to own if you own more than one tape and on dvd. Good luck finding a copy.
B00004TEUX|5.0|Mendelssohn's Scotch Symphony is Maag's speciality. I had a chance to go to his concert in Tokyo more than 10 years ago, he was able to drive the music even from a local symphony. I love this symphony, and have listened to other conductors, such as Leonard Bernstein, Claudio Abbado, and Herbert Von Karajan, but I believe Peter Maag is the best conductor for the symphony in terms of clarity and appropriate expression.
B00005JKZT|5.0|Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is the continuation of last year's Fellowship of the Ring. Frodo the ring bearer (Elijah Wood) and his trusted companion Sam Gamgee (Sean Astin) find themselves going in circles while trying to get to Mordor. They realize they're being followed by the ring obsessed creature Gollum, they capture him and Frodo decides to use him as a guide to Mordor. Gollum is exactly the way I imagined him in the book, well except for the fact I pictured him green. Well anyway he's very well done, he steals the show in fact. After the movie he's all people talked about. While watching it I even found myself thinking too bad the actor that plays Gollum \\"but was replaced by CGI of course\\" can't be nominated. Gollum by the way is absolutely no Jar Jar Binks, he's what George wishes Jar Jar could be like . I especially wouldn't mind seeing The Hobbit get made and get some more light shed on Gollum's past.<br /> Well besides Frodo and Sam's adventure Aragorn, Gimli, Legolas and Gandalf who has returned more powerful have to defend Helm's Deep from Saruman's huge army of Orks. Also Merry and Pippen escape from a gang of Orks and stumble apon a talking tree named Tree Beard. They try to convince him and his group of other talking trees named Ents to fight against Sauruman and his army as the world is at stake.<br /> To sum it all up this movie is just fantastic. The visuals, the locations, the action and the cast are all just incredible. Also I have to say that I don't agree with Roger Ebert's complaints at all in his review. He really needs to read the books he claims he knows so well again. There's something wrong when you give the Harry Potter movies 4 stars and the LOTR movies only 3 stars. If he read Potter books he'd see those movies aren't entirely faithful to the books either.<br /> Yes the other characters such as Aragorn have a bigger part to play than the Hobbits but can't say I found that to be any different in the books. They are taught to be braver by people like Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli and get braver by the 3rd book. So if he'd be patient, will probably be the same with the movies. He acts like Peter Jacksons version will have J.R.R. Tolken rolling around in his grave which I don't think is the case at all. He takes making the adaption from book to screen seriously and you can tell that just by looking at the scenes with Gollum. The part where Gollum is in the sacred pond catching a fish and Frodo has to convince him to leave is exactly the way I pictured it while reading the book. The way Gollum has conversations with his other personality Smeagol is just simply awesome, it's scary, funny and pure genious at the same time. Pure genious is exactly what should be said about this masterpiece of an epic adventure. To add to my review it's nice to that the Two Towers has been nominated for best picture. I can't imagine why Peter Jackson hasn't been nominated for best director again though. Also 2 actors that deserved to be nominated are Miranda Otto as &Eacute;owyn<br />Bernard Hill and Th&eacute;oden. Miranda Otto is as gifted of an actress as she is beautiful, she really makes you feel her love for Aragorn. Bernard Hill is wonderful as well, I've seen a few names nominated for best supporting actor  this year that I don't think deserve it more than him. Of course they should of found some way to nominate Gollum as well as he steals the show almost completely.raver by people like Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli and get braver by the 3rd book. So if he'd be patient, will probably be the same with the movies. He acts like Peter Jacksons version will have J.R.R. Tolken rolling around in his grave which I don't think is the case at all.

I can't imagine why Peter Jackson hasn't been nominated for best director again though. Also 2 actors that deserved to be nominated are Miranda Otto as &Eacute;owyn<br />Bernard Hill and Th&eacute;oden. Miranda Otto is as gifted of an actress as she is beautiful, she really makes you feel her love for Aragorn. Bernard Hill is wonderful as well, I've seen a few names nominated for best supporting actor  this year that I don't think deserve it more than him. Of course they should of found some way to nominate Gollum as well as he steals the show almost completely.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|...and most thought provoking movies I have ever seen.  It took me a good two views, extra features, director commentary, and discussion with friends to understand it, and I loved every minute of trying to figure it out. Unlike so many other movies of today (or even of the past) this movie makes you think deeply about what you've seen, and makes every minute of its existence important to watch.  While holding interest is usually a big task for movies, this will keep you watching (and wondering) for not only the length of the movie, but for a long time afterward.  Director Richard Kelly perfectly blends the elements of fantasy and a fairly believeable suburban family in the late 80's into this masterpiece of modern film making.<br />If you've ever seen this movie (without owning it) or considered buying it on VHS, don't even bother.  Simply put, you NEED to add this DVD to your collection.  The movie is good enough, but the features add even more depth to the story (albeit explaining a bit too much in the 'book' excerpts), enough depth to warrant its purchase.<br />Lastly, I haven't tired of this movie despite multiple views, and I watched it even after I fully understood what was happening.  It's just that good.  Less than 5 other movies I've seen can make that claim to fame, and as a matter of fact, I can't think of any of them right now.
B00005JKLZ|2.0|Well to say the least I was pretty disappointed in the way this Movie was Directed. I wouldn't blame Pearce totally for a bad acting job in this one because the movie was severly rushed. The Characters and Story never had anytime in this Movie to Develop into anything. And the Special Effects could of been a lot better especially with the Technology the Movie Makers have today and the Budget they put into this Flick. If they would of taken the time and let the story and characters Develop(like making the Movie about 2- 2 1/2 hours long) then this movie would of been better. Too bad though this could of been a Better movie if it was Directed right. The only thing that saves this flick from total .... is Guy Pearce.
B00005JL78|3.0|I'm not a big fan of Tom Cruise.  His acting often seems forced and overly intense.  But, for once, he stars in a movie that uses his limited skills properly.  Minority Report is a good movie and kept me interested the whole way.  But it's not a keeper.  If one can accept the premise that the future can be known, it makes it a lot easier to buy into the plot.  There are a few nifty twists, but also a lot of predictable outcomes.  Some of the futristic scenery and gizmos are fun, but it didn't add up to a story that moved me.  Worth watching once.

0312958455|5.0|It's only been in the past couple of weeks that veteran L.A. homicide detective Hieronymus \\"Harry\\" Bosch pushed his boss's face through the plate glass window of the latter's office. You see, Lt. Pounds - the consummate desk jockey - had interfered with one of Harry's interrogations, which resulted in the (probably guilty) suspect walking free. Now, Bosch is on involuntary stress leave with orders to see the department head doctor. To kill time between appointments, Harry unofficially re-opens an unsolved 30+ year-old murder case, that of his mother, a Hollywood hooker. Then there's his Hollywood Hills home, damaged by a recent earthquake and subsequently earmarked for demolition, to worry about. It makes for angst that would cause testiness even in the Pope. And, when Pounds is tortured and murdered and Lt. Brockman of Internal Affairs brings Bosch in for the third degree, our hero loses it:<br />\\"Bosch shoved the table toward Brockman ... and pinned Brockman against the wall ... as he went without air ... (Brockman's) eyes bugged.\\"<br />The fictional road to this book's conclusion is the well-travelled one through police and political chicanery, either of which I can read about in the daily newspaper if I feel the unlikely compulsion.  Rather, since each of us perhaps occasionally feels that mad urge for self destruction, the fun of THE LAST COYOTE is watching Bosch be a bull in his own china shop and then clean up the shards. Even that would earn it only four stars, in my opinion, except that the completely unexpected plot twist in the last ten pages merits it the ultimate fifth. If you're still bothering to fly the nation's unfriendly skies, or you're just stuck in a long post office que, THE LAST COYOTE is the perfect distraction to numb the experience.

B00005JKZT|2.0|Having read the books a couple of times, i feel i know the story pretty well. Now the first movie strayed a little from the book, and it was ok. The two towers on the other hand........ I have to wonder if peter jackson even had a copy of the second book. This movie did everything but follow the storyline of the book. Don't get me wrong the graphics and action and all that were outstanding, but why even make a movie after a book if you arent going to follow the book, at least a little. I for one am disappointed, and doubt that I'll visit the theatre to see it as many times as the first.

B00005JLWL|5.0|This is quite simply one of the most amazing movies I've ever seen.  The actors fit the roles perfectly.  Its amazing what a movie about feeling can make you feel while you sit there...on the edge of your seat of course.<br />I can't finish this without mentioning that the action scenes are amazing.  They are revolutionary and I can't say I've seen anything like it.  Its like Kurt Wimmer invented a new fighting style specifically for this movie!<br />Basically, go see this movie.  It was the first movie where I left the theater and immediately went and bought another ticket for the next showing.
0151008116|5.0|On Page 161 of Life of Pi, Yann Martel writes an amazing passage on fear and our will to defeat it: \\"I must say a word about fear. It is life's only true opponent.  Only fear can defeat life.  It is a clever, treacherous adversary, how well I know . . . One moment you are feeling calm, self-possessed, happy. Then fear, disguised in the garb of mild-mannered doubt, slips into your mind like a spy .... Your anxiety becomes dread ... real fear, such as shakes you to your foundation . . seeks to rot everything, even the words with which to speak of it.  So you must fight hard to express it. . .\\"<br />Throughout Life of Pi, Pi Patel is faced with massive fear and he works diligently to fight it.  Sometimes, he goes through motions that he does not think about in order to defeat his fear (of dying at sea, being eaten by Richard Parker, the 450 pound Bengal Tiger; Pi lost his whole family when the ship on which they were traveling, from India to Canada, sank; he miraculously survives on a lifeboat with the tiger).  <br />How many of us have faced incredible and excruciating fear that we thought we could never get through?  Reading Life of Pi reminds me of the great story of Sir Richard Shackleton's survival in the Antarctic in 1914.  Shackleton was middle-aged and Pi is a young man, but both had guts that proves to all of us that no matter how bad the fear and self-doubt become, somehow we can defeat these awful feelings, and can do it when we are feeling totally at sea.<br />This is an life giving story and one that has beautiful descriptions of the sea and the creatures Pi lives with during his 227 day travail of survival.

0446677450|3.0|Everyone should read this book, because it does do a wonderful job in getting you to analyze your attitude towards investing. However, it does nothing more than tout the high-rish high-yield style of investment while making it seem like anything more conservative is unthinkable. The book is pervaded with a condescending and snobbish tone, which is understandable to an extent, but it gets old. In short, investment advice we've all heard before partnered with pretentious motivational one-liners wrapped in an 'easy money' teasing which I'm sure Mr. Kiyosaki, with his experience in marketing, realized would sell this book. If you feel the need to buy a Porsche and retire at 40, perhaps you'll appreciate this book more.

B00005MP58|5.0|I have only one very minor carp about this production: they should have included the scene where Lizzie tells her mother she is marrying Mr Darcy. It's one of the funniest pieces of dialogue in English literature - anyone who hasn't read the book will find it worth while for that alone. This was the best costume drama the BBC (OK, and A&amp;E) have ever done, and they do one every fall. I'm still waiting for them to exceed this, but doubt that they ever will. Us poor Brits have to pay a license fee for the BBC, as they don't allow advertising, but when they come up with something like this we tend to concede that it's worth it. My then 16 yr old daughter moaned when it was first on TV. I told her to shut up and watch it; within 10 minutes she was hooked and has watched about 97 times since. Yes, the chemistry between Mr D and Lizzie was wonderful but I loved the minor characters, too: after first reading P&amp;P many years ago the ones that stuck in my head were the loathsome Lady Catherine and Mr Collins. These are perfection in this production: absolutely nobody could have done them better. And for the information of one reviewer, Mrs Bennet is SUPPOSED to be annoying! (For heaven's sake!) Anyone who enjoyed this will probably also enjoy the Kate Beckinsale (as opposed to Gwyneth P) version of Emma. Prunella Scales (Fawlty Towers) does a truly wonderful Miss Bates, and Mr Woodhouse is also perfection. For my money Mark Strong also makes a far more wooze-making and 'knightly' version of Mr Knightley than the chap Gwyneth's Emma ended up with. <br />As many reviewers have said, this P&amp;P is one to watch over and over: when you're sick, feeling down, or just feel like it...  Sublime chicken soup for the romantic soul. <BR>Oh, and I do with Andrew Davies and his crew would do some of the Georgette Heyer novels. Black Sheep, anybody?
0066214122|3.0|Crichton used to be my favorite author before being replaced by Preston and Child.  I like Crichton's books because they usually have an interesting premise and are enfused with technological information.  Preston and Child are also able to create fascinating plots by blending historical events, biochemistry, and the supernatural.  However, while Preston and Child's books seem polished with excellent character development and dialogue, Crichton's recent books have been short with thin character development and awkward dialogue.  The pages are filled with blank space adding to the appearance that this is really a short story and not a novel.  Crichton's books are most interesting when he describes what a character is thinking of doing and not when they are speaking.  There just isn't enough of this material to justify a full length novel.  The book kept my attention, but it is not Crichton's best work.
6305165912|5.0|I must say this piece of art is exactly that.  John Goodman and Jeff Bridges are phenomenal.  Talk about getting into caricature! The fist time I saw the movie was great.  The second was better.  Every scene was, as captivating as the next and unlike many other movies it gets progressively better as the storyline unfolds.  There aren't too many movies I would give 5 stars to but &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; is well disserving of this rating.
B00004W221|5.0|I am a 41 year old male, and I can never get through the end of this movie without getting misty eyed.  It is one of my favorite, and an inspiration to anyone who questions their own self-worth and ability.

Every family should have this video on their shelf!
B00006JJ1O|4.0|This cd is a great listen, I really enjoy the &quot;How Soon is Now?&quot; cover (an old the smiths song). There is a few flaws in there english songs but they are obviously new to the language and I wish Lena and Julia could express themselfs more through the english language when it comes to the enhanced movies on there CD but they run into there language barrier.<br />     It does seem that they are a heavily produced duo on stage and off but there is so many pop acts in America currently that are worse so I don't see this as much of a problem since they are both young and need direction til they can find there own musical journey to take. Hopefuly as there english learning progresses and they can express themselfs more through lyrics and interviews they will be a fantastic act to watch in the future.<br />    Good luck breaking through into the USA, it is a tuff journey and I hope you plot it well else they will become a one-hit-wonder in America.
B00006FDCD|1.0|Given that this picture was produced for network television, I suppose I should have known what I was in for; however, there were enough approving onsite reviews without spelling errors in the title to give me hope for a little amusement, and perhaps a few honest scares.  I've missed the creepy fun of some of those microbudget TV Feel-Bad Movies of the 70's; some of them, like Salem's Lot, or Devil Dog, The Hound of Hell, can really spook you if you watch them by yourself late at night.  Sadly, made-for-tv horror movies have really been atrocious since the dawn of videotape in the early 80's; there is something so desperately unfrightening and sterile about the look of movies shot on video that I'm not sure it would be possible to wrench any atmosphere out of a film shot in this format.  But in this case, the source material (one of Stephen King's throwaways) was so damn scary that it seemed almost impossible to screw it up.<br />Unless, of course, you're Tommy Lee Wallace, the director of this mess.  I was convinced that this film was his sixth-grade honors project until I read his bio.  At first I wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt, and blame the actors, who are mostly elementary schoolers.  But perfectly fine performers, such as John Ritter, Richard Masur, Tim Curry, Annette O'Toole, and Seth Green perform their line readings as if they were acting in a low-budget porno.  And for most of the movie Wallace seems to just plop down the camera in front of these boobs, without any thought to composing the scene, and watch them overact, as if their cheesy shrieks and hand-wringing were enough to scare us silly.<br />What's more amazing is that Wallace even neglects some of the basic tricks of the low-budget horror genre, that might have saved him if he had any instincts for suspense or terror.  The whole thing looks like it was shot with the (flourescent) lights on, and nearly the entire film takes place outside, on apparently the sunniest day of the year; even the underground sewers are lighted like someone's kitchen.  And the special effects are really bad; Wallace could've been more effective if he'd ditched all the fake blood, third-rate opticals, and jerky claymation in favor of 99 cent flashlights placed under the actors' chins.  In honesty, no one involved with this picture, least of all the director, the cinematographer, or the editor, seems to realize that they're making a horror film.  Scenes drag on interminably, sometimes to the point of catching the actors dropping out of character before someone yells \\"cut\\", and whenever a moment of fright is meant to be conveyed there is a close-up of Tim Curry in Kabuki makeup and plastic fangs going \\"boo!\\".<br />I cannot imagine that anyone over the age of 4 could be frightened by this picture.  But then again, one Amazon user thought it was the best horror movie she ever saw--and if we assume she's seen Carrie, Rosemary's Baby, Nosferatu, Don't Look Now, Jaws, or something by real amateurs like, say, Hitchcock, that's quite a compliment.  Could that be the true horror of a movie like \\"It\\"?even the underground sewers are lighted like someone's kitchen.

B000063DFW|3.0|Let me start by saying, I just can't stand those people who became an LP fan AFTER hearing the In The End single. Ok, anyways, this isn't a smart buy. You shouldn't spend 20 more dollars to hear extra tracks you can easily find on the internet. And, I heard some people saying that High Voltage is an AC/DC cover.

B000003S0B|5.0|Following in the footsteps of King Crimson's acclaimed debut, \\"In the Wake of Poseidon\\" is often vastly overshadowed by its revolutionary predecessor.  All too often criticized and degraded for sounding too much like Crimson's preceding effort, \\"In the Wake of Poseidon\\" was never really given a fair chance to be judged on its own terms.  Now that the then fresh impact of \\"In the Court of the Crimson King\\" is decades behind us, it's a wonder that \\"In the Wake of Poseidon\\" was not better received.  When listening to it now, the album actually holds up significantly better in comparison to Crim's rather half-hearted debut.  While \\"In the Court of the Crimson King\\" seemed to lack focus and meander far too much, Robert Fripp's almost full control of the band for its second outing adds cohesiveness and conciseness to the CD making for a much stronger, complete statement.  Even though the song structures of the two CDs may be strikingly similar at times, \\"Pictures of a City\\" is strongly reminiscent of \\"21st Century Schizoid Man\\" and the title track sounds like a not so distant cousin of \\"Epitaph\\", Fripp's solo guidance and individual thought process allows the album to follow a much more linear series of events that creates a distinctly climactic atmosphere throughout the album and provides a definite overall focus or theme that was badly lacking from the band's previous effort.  Gaining intensity with every track, the raw tensions and emotions are held together by transitional \\"peace\\" interludes and as the album builds its velocity and momentum it finally climaxes with the manic string piece \\"The Devil's Triangle\\".  Every song encapsulates a wide range of evocative imagery and flowing, crescendos and decrescendos enough to make each one a detailed, full standalone idea that not only aids the creation of the album as a whole, but stands as being more developed individually than past works as well.  That is where the seeming true goal of \\"In the Wake of Poseidon\\" can be found.  Whether it was due to something as complex as Fripp's almost fastidious drive to achieve perfection in his work or simply a desire to finish what the band had begun, \\"In the Wake of Poseidon\\" was not a copy of the first album but a completion of it.  Many of the ideas presented on \\"In the Court of the Crimson King\\" seemed half finished or held back but when these same ideas were taken and fleshed out and fully developed, they turned into the CD that should've been King Crimson's proper debut to begin with.  Although \\"In the Wake of Poseidon\\" didn't necessarily break any new ground for King Crimson, I think it is almost unquestionably a stronger album than the CD it draws upon and the consistently high song quality should really be more than enough to warrant one's attention.
0316666343|4.0|It isn't often that a book is written from a victim's point of view and I have to admit that I was skeptical about this at first.  However, I put aside my reservations and picked it up.  I didn't put it down until I had finished the entire book.  The book is written in the language of a teenager and it read as though Susie Salmon herself was telling the story.  This was one of the things I enjoyed most about the book.<br />Alice Sebold offers wonderful, yet unconventional, view of heaven. I was moved to tears as Susie told the story of her tragic death at the tender age of 14, and as she watched the lives of her loved ones fall apart after her death.  It was a touching and insightful look into grief and the healing process.<br />I highly reccommend this book, but I would caution everyone to read it with an open mind.

B000009ED0|1.0|Kid Rock is a rapper from the Detroit area who's been doing his thing and running his own Top Dog record label since the late '80s. He was pretty obscure until Grand Royal profiled him, and he eventually wrote some blurbs for Mike D. and the gang for their notorious \\"Miami Bass\\" issue. His association with the Beasties must have done wonders for his career, because in '98 he made this, his major label debut.<br />I gave this record bonus points for having a photograph of the Kid's hand giving the world the finger painted on the disc itself. Something about the way Kid Rock flips the bird is endearing-- it's hard to explain. I bumped the record up a few more notches for the track featuring the diminutive Joe C. (he's less than four feet tall) on the mic. There's some sort of perverse thrill in hearing a guy who makes Bushwick Bill look like Manute Bol rap \\"I'm a freak, don't call me sick/ three- foot nine with a ten-foot dick.\\"<br />So that's two rounds of bonus points and the album still doesn't merit a 2. The hook is that Devil Without A Cause combines rap with metal, but this combination's already been done a million times, and in each case, the result was better than this...
B00006LSM3|3.0|George got sick around 1998, so it makes you wonder what he'd been doing from 1987 to 97.<br />I'll explain: I'm not playing the cold reviewer by saying he could have released a better produced or performed album in 2002, as we are aware that from 2000 to 2001 he went through serious health problems.<br />Well, my question is: why didn't he put out newer tracks instead of leftovers like Vatican P2 Blues?<br />I felt a little bit lost guessing about that, because that's a real throaway from the marvellous Cloud 9 album.<br />Also, there are a few songs like Run So Far (already released by Eric Clapton!!!), Between The Devil And Deep Blue Sea (a cover song after 10 years????) and Pisces Fish (goes nowhere) that made Braiwashed a little below my expectations.<br />On the production side: it's not that I don't dig Lynne's work. I do. But, again, there's too many ELO sounding on a few tracks that annoys me a little bit.<br />For instance, on Rising Sun - a great track, if not the best one.<br />Gosh, it has so much Lynne on that which makes you a little bit embarassed.<br />The highest points of the album are the quality of songs like Stuck Inside A Cloud and Any Road that makes it worth as a Christmas present...<br />Don't expect from me comparing to other Beatles solo works. Let's look to the artist in his own right and don't feel pity because George passed away. It's just an album that could have been stronger had he been still alive, which is the worst part of the story.

0060987464|5.0|The book &quot;The Long Hard Road Out Of Hell&quot; by Marilyn Manson wasn't a New York Times bestseller for nothing. It's basically a biography of his life, told this his perspective. It's a suprising story of how he got to the top, and what he had to do to get there. This story starts out with him discovering things such as dildos and vaselines in his grandfather's basement, and it only gets more interesting. This book isn't for the weakhearted, though. I'm not a fan of his music, but he's had a very interesting life. I definately reccomend picking this up.
B000002UZ1|5.0|I bought this collection on casette when it was first released and wore it out!  The sound quality is outstanding.  This collection starts with Strawberry Fields Forever and ends with the Long and Winding Road.  In between, it covers every album and single that the Beatles released after they gave up touring.  It also contains versions of Let it Be and Get Back not found on the Let it Be album (these versions are also included on Past Masters Vol. 2) Together with the &quot;red album&quot; (1962-1966), this collection offers a nice overview of Beatles material.  Anyone looking for a great Beatles compilation can't go wrong with this 2 disc set.
B000069HKH|1.0|I LIKED Springsteen, until this album came out. The idea of putting out an album ENTIRELY about 9/11 seemed awfully cheap, but I  listened to it anyway.  Weather you like \\"the boss\\" or not, this album, in my opinion, cheapens the lives of everyone that died that day. Make an album with one song about the national tragedy, you're compationate and you show the world how the day deeply affected you. Make an album where every song is about it, and the meaning seems less sincere with every track. And if it's a tribute album, why didn't all of the proceeds go to charities instead of in the Boss' pockets? Sorry, Boss, but you've forever lost this fan.
B00005B1EX|5.0|This is by far the best live CD I have purchased in years.  The sound quality is outstanding, and the track selection covers the career of Rob Halford.  Rob's old bandmates Judas Priest also have a live disc out, but it pales in comparison to Halford's  offering.  Skip the Priest release and buy this one instead.  You won't be disappointed.
B00005J6T0|4.0|While this album may be a little silly or childish in the eyes of some narrow-minded, what it really is is a little time capsule of great 80's pop music. It may sound outdated today, sure, but who can resist songs like OPEN YOUR HEART and PAPA DON'T PREACH, with their cool, strengthening lyrics and excellent vocals via Madonna? While there may be pop ditties that essentially need no further listen to like JIMMY JIMMY, WHERE'S THE PARTY?, or LOVE MAKES THE WORLD GO 'ROUND (the latter two of which are actually still good-sounding), the album is still full of good material, an odd accomplishment. For an album of relatively short length, True Blue packs in a great amount of fun ear candy. Also included are the presence of three other Top 5 hits, TRUE BLUE (very much a ditty but a hit), the haunting #1 ballad LIVE TO TELL and the flighty, darkly enchanting LA ISLA BONITA. Another lesser-known treat on the album is WHITE HEAT, Madonna's dedication to James Cagney. All in all, if you're looking for some good 80's pop or you're a Madonna completist that hasn't picked up a copy of TRUE BLUE yet, go ahead and do pick up a copy. Now you have no excuse, with the two great remixes at the end and the fantastic original LP artwork included. In fact, the front cover should make it an easy sell anyway.
B00005OAIE|5.0|whenever i first heard john mayer i wasnt for sure if he was for me or not. then my boyfriend started to listen to a little bit of his older songs and thats when i really began to appreciate his music. he is so talented for his age that its unreal. i saw him in concert and during one of the songs he was playing the guitar and the keyboard AT THE SAME TIME. i was in awe. my boyfriend passed away a few weeks back and its still sad but whenever i put john mayer in the c/d player i always think of him and our wonderful time at the concert.
B000068PQ0|4.0|This is a really groovy disc!  Wayne and The Lips know how to transcend that whole singer/songwriter genre and take it even further into the unknown.  This is a very moody effort, and is something that is full of darkness and light w/ an amazing amount of lyrical introspection.  Wayne sounds like a healthy mix of Cat Stevens at his best and Neil Young at his most folky, I suppose.  Good stuff from an impressive Experimental Rock band that's been around for a while, so pick this one up soon!  Also, Fight Test is the stand out track for me personally...with Yoshimi Battles The Pink Robots being a close second.
0060930349|5.0|Perhaps the most refreshing thing about Mr. Johnson's history is the explosion of three myths. First, that Thomas Jefferson was a great American. Second, that Warren Harding was the prototypical immoral man. Finally, that FDR was a hero with his New Deal.<br />In addition, Mr. Johnson's history is very accurate both in its division of American History into periods and in the various elements of each period. I recommend this to all interested.
B000066NW0|5.0|She doesn't like to be called pop, but lets face it people.  She pretty much is on this record.  I don't hold that against her though.  She is 18 and trying to get started..and for this being her first record, I am impressed.  Some may not agree with me, and that is fine, but this chick is great.  She can sing, she can write, she can play.  In my eyes, that is the triple threat..not singing, dancing, and being bubble gum.
B000002L7R|4.0|I remember buying this album as a kid when it was first released, and was prepared tolisten to the '80-'84 sound of Prince that we had grown comfortable with. But, that didn't happen. I can honestly say that the older that i have gotten, the more i have appreciated this album. It brings back alot of memories for me. The best part of the album at the time of its release were the 12&quot; versions of the singles on the album. &quot;Raspberry beret&quot;, &quot;Pop-life&quot;, and &quot;america&quot;. The b-sides were &quot;shes always in my hair&quot;, &quot;Girl&quot;, and &quot;Hello&quot;.<BR>If U can find these or still own them they are rarities, and some of the best b-sides Prince ever released.
B000069HK2|4.0|The Used..a punk rock band full of emotion.  These guys can write lyrics that will strike a nerve in your heart.  And at the same time keep the guitar sounding like the angry punk rock that we all have come to love.  The lead singer can make his voice sound like it is full of tears, and then scream so loud, with such energy, your cats will jump.  (I know for a fact, it happened here)  They are Nirvana with a 2000 twist.
B000002OOY|4.0|Well, actually there were two different limited editions of this score. The first limited edition had a slightly different cover and the CD itself has the Jurassic Park logo in shades of blue as well as the island itself. Back in 1994 I got a second limited edition soundtrack of Jurassic Park. It featured only two tracks from the film, 'Theme from Jurassic Park' and 'End Credits'. The first was a suite of all the main cues and the second is the same as the final track seen here.<br />If, like me, you found the score in the movie to be to repetitive then I suggest seeking out this rare release and getting it instead. All the best themes get a good workout and it's good to listen to whenever you want a feel of Jurassic Park without having to listen to many tracks on the other releases. It comes with a free poster and is released by MCA, as is this release and the first limited edition.
B00005JKZT|5.0|We just got home from seeing The Two Towers and oh!  It is WONDERFUL!  As a fan of The Lord of the Rings for about 35 years, I am still stunned at how authentic Peter Jackson and everyone associated with this trilogy have been able to make it.  This one is as good or better than Fellowship if that's possible.  I NEVER thought anyone would be able to do this profound and many-leveled, many-event, story justice but they have done it.  Obviously they can't include everything that's in the books or everything exactly like the books BUT what they have done is convey the depth and feel of the epic - they have retained its very essence and why it is a masterpiece.  <br />We sat riveted for the entire approximately 3 hours. Riveted.<br />What more can I say?<br />Now I can't wait for the DVD to come out so I can watch it a zillion times like I did Fellowship and I REALLY can't wait for The Return of the King.  <br />Oh, it was stunning!  Amazing!
1577311523|5.0|This book is for people who want to understand life and life processes more thoroughly with a fresh outlook. It is for people who would like to extract the senseless and unwanted pain from their lives and see things more clearly.  Learning to live in the present moment will change your life whether you think it will or not.  There is nothing more sacred than to appreciate and celebrate each moment.  It is called living.  Eckhart gave us a precious account of his experience and spiritual search.  We all could,if willing,learn from it.
B00006G8G1|5.0|January 19, 2001 marked perhaps the highest point in Iron Maiden's career. It was approximately 25 years before this date that Steve Harris, Dave Murray and a plethora of their early members were gigging all around the East End and throughout their hometown with ambitions to be on top of the world. On that day in January, they triumphed over ambition as one of the headliners at the Rock in Rio festival, playing before 250,000 people. This DVD isn't just a live concert; it's a part of Heavy Metal history.<br />Iron Maiden has always been known for their over-the-top performances and this DVD definitely captures the best of the best. Every member puts everything they have into playing the music. Disc One of the set is the actual live show, edited and mastered by Steve Harris himself. Disc Two is some bonus footage including interviews, a photo gallery, web site links and a portion entitled 'A Day In The Life'. The last of which I believe can also be found on the Rock In Rio double album. <br />Disc One. The quality is very good. It's clean and crisp. I didn't find any problems with it at all. Obviously, if you've heard the double CD, you'll know what the sound quality is. However, you experience the full effect of the music and the show, you should probably have two speakers on your TV. With just one, some of the sound is lost (in my case, all of Janick's guitar parts aren't heard). I don't know if it's the DVD but do yourself a favor anyway.<br />The footage itself is amazing, in my opinion. Shot from a series of different cameras, Steve Harris viewed all of it and spliced it all down to create the two hours of footage seen. I think he did a fantastic job covering every aspect of the stage that night while still capturing the essence of the band's live performance (I have read some pretty poor reviews about the editing work, however). Every member is in top form (especially Bruce) as they command the stage, running from place to place, plowing through the classics. The stage set up is great, the lighting is good and the camera work is great. Overall, an awesome and entertaining viewing of the band's stellar live show.<br />Disc Two. The second disc starts off with the interviews. Each member is interviewed while showing what they do on their time away from touring, writing and recording. It gives a little insight into how heavy metal stars enjoy normal things just like anyone else. While some of it is somewhat comical, the rest of it is pretty informative as to how each member lives, how they got their start in music and a little bit about how they view on the band in the present. The second part is the 'A Day In The Life' portion, which shows the band's day up to and after the Rock In Rio performance. Press conferences, their arrival, preparing for their performance and the parties afterward. Entertaining and comical, at times. Not much else can be said. Third is the Photo Gallery of the band with commentary on each picture by Ross Halfin. Some cool pictures and some good information. The last two items on the disc are the credits and some website links.<br />January 19, 2001 marked perhaps the highest point in Iron Maiden's career. The essence of their live shows was put into overdrive that night as they performed for their biggest headlining crowd to date. That performance, all the power, energy, anguish, ability and excitement, can be found here on this DVD. I recommend this to any die-hard Maiden fans as well as anyone who has never seen the band perform live before. Anyone who wasn't satisfied with the Rock In Rio CD might be turned off by the music but the performance is sheer excellence. Definitely buy this.
B00005O438|5.0|It is a masterpiece. The book is even more outstanding
B000075BFK|5.0|this is probably one of the best if not the best cd i have ever got in my life you will believe it when u get it
B000002NJS|5.0|Madonna's album \\"Ray Of Light\\" is probably one of her most creative albums yet. She shines brightly on this album with ultra creative lyrics,beats,topics,and even video concepts.This is one of my favorite Madonna albums,though all of them are really good. If you don't already have this album (which by now you should)buy it!!\\"Ray Of Light\\" will make you realise what a creative woman Madonna is. You simply can't go wrong with this album, from tracks like \\"Candy Perfume Girl\\" to \\"Frozen\\" you will love it.<br />***I would also highly recommend \\"Bedtime Stories\\"***
B00006JJ1O|5.0|I've been a fan of TATU for about a year and I loved there russian CD and i couldn't wait till their CD came out in english. I got it as soon as it was released and I'll tell you i was not dissapointed. The CD is amazing its got great lyrics a great beat and Yulia and Lena sound amazing. The CD is addictive. It's all ive listened to since I bought it. I definetly recommend that you buy this CD. It's just an amazing album.
B000002U9E|5.0|You have to give credit to Kate Bush for being able to use the word &quot;asunder&quot; in a song.  With that said RUNNING UP THAT HILL is my favorite Kate Bush tune.  I first fell in love with her music when I saw the video to RUNNING UP THAT HILL back in the early 1980s.  From that point on I was hooked.  HOUNDS OF LOVE is a great album, if not her best.  I wait in anticipation to each album she releases.  She hasn't come out with anything since THE RED SHOES and I am Jonesing for some new Kate!  Each of her songs is a slice of life, a movie to be visualized, an emotion to be felt.
B00003CXA6|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time, a movie which sparked what may well become a life long interest in the Civil War.  This DVD does more than justice to it.  The sound quality is amazing - during the cannonade before Picket's charge, the floor actually shakes.  Even more impressive are the wealth of features.  Both short films - the Gettysburg documentary, and the making of the movie - are excellent, and really do add a lot to the film.  The maps are a useful tool, and the commentaries quite interesting (although it is admitted that they do not cover the entire movie).For anyone who has yet to read to book, do not miss it!  Although I am quite fond of Jeff Sharra's work as well, Michael Sharra's Pultizer for this novel was more than well deserved.  The movie's coverage is quite through, but the little details should not be missed.
B00005KARK|4.0|This is an excellent DVD to give a child for the holidays.  My niece loves this DVD, and that is the ultimate review from a three year old.  Three year olds in my experience are very honest, so whatever else is said about this DVD know this, it passess the test of a youngster.  So, if you have youngsters, and you need them to be distracted, this is a great tool.<br />Joseph Dworak
B00003CX9E|2.0|I finally watched this movie the other night and I didn't understand the hype. Some of the sequences were impressive and certainly the age of welles is quite amazing... All in all, I found it kind of hard to follow. The plot jumped around too much and delved too deeply into a character you felt that you should know but you really didn't.<br />I guess my main problem is the fact that this is supposed to be one of the greatest films ever made so when I watched I was expecting to be blown away and I didn't even catch a breeze. Watch it and appreciate the techniques but don't expect it to change you life.
B000069HKH|4.0|I have always been a \\"luke warm\\" Springsteen fan and have not bought anything by Bruce since Born In The USA. This is his best effort in a long time. He stands on the style of his old stuff while at the same time moves into new musical realms. A great example is the 7th track \\"Worlds Apart\\". The songs are gritty and passionate. For die hard fans, the returning fans and the new generation of fans, there is something for everyone on this disc.
B00000IP3S|5.0|what can i say? this album is another heavy metal master piece. everything about this album is amazing. heavy hitting guitars, drums and vocals make this album one of the best. songs like \\"Mordred's song\\" \\"Bright Eyes\\" \\"And The Story Ends\\" to name a few are remarkable, they all are. buy this album, you will not regret it!!
B00006LI4S|5.0|If David Gilmour's music had evidenced this kind of vision for the last decade and a half, he might have immunized himself from the scorn of those who thought Pink Floyd suffered a beheading when Roger Waters departed. Gilmour has absolutely reinvigorated many of these songs. Some are performed with substantially new arrangements for the very first time, no longer suffocated by Gilmour's almost military precision during Pink Floyd's last two tours. Gilmour even includes two songs from Syd Barrett's solo repertoire, \\"Terrapin\\" and \\"Dominoes,\\" preserving their surreal playfulness without succumbing to the frustration and anxiety that pervade Barrett's own recordings. Most refreshing of all, Pink Floyd classics such as \\"Comfortably Numb,\\" which has never sounded quite right without a united Floyd, finally bloom under the stewardship of a band capable of recapturing some elusive but essential qualities of the original recordings. This great song has suffered endless failed makeovers, including execrable vocals by Van Morrison in Berlin and Bruce Hornsby in Seville as well as Gilmour's soulless arrangement from 1984 to 1994 that sounds in retrospect not altogether unlike grunge metal. The versions on this DVD begin at a slow, sedate pace that should transfix listeners of such bands as the Grateful Dead and the Cowboy Junkies. Each features a different vocalist substituting for Roger Waters. I slightly favor Bob Geldof, whose starring role in The Wall film certainly bolsters his credibility here, but both successfully execute the hushed expressiveness that characterizes Waters' vocals. The atmosphere unravels as it was intended, fraught with trepidation in the beginning, anasthetized on a cushion of air when Gilmour's chorus melts the tension, and soaring above everything once Gilmour unleashes the greatest guitar solo ever played, which always sounds as though it wants to continue wailing forever.<br />Other highlights of the performance that merit special comment include \\"Smile,\\" debuting here, a beautiful new song similar in style to \\"Green is the Colour\\"; \\"Je Crois Entendre Encore,\\" a serene but haunting Bizet aria; \\"Fat Old Sun,\\" Gilmour's first performance of his 1970 composition since that era; and \\"Breakthrough,\\" from Floyd keyboardist Rick Wright's underappreciated 1996 solo album, Broken China. Although Sinead O'Connor sang \\"Breakthrough\\" on the album, Wright appears here as a guest (to great applause) and performs the vocals with Gilmour's band. Accordingly, this is the only version of one of Wright's best songs that he actually sings himself.  One should also take care not to neglect the special features the DVD offers in addition to the main performance. Even presented alone, they would stand among the most interesting artifacts in the Pink Floyd universe, and longtime fans should applaud the powers that be for finally realizing that these experiments and curios merit commercial release. The most interesting is the choral version of \\"High Hopes,\\" where Gilmour brings his dozen background vocalists to the foreground and treats the audience to a haunting tone poem. Minimalism triumphs as the choral component alone proves more arresting than \\"High Hopes\\" itself, as beautifully chilling as the \\"Celestial Voices\\" part of Floyd's psychedelic melange, \\"A Saucerful of Secrets.\\" Also included is William Shakespeare's Sonnet 18 (\\"Shall I compare thee to a summer's day? . . .\\"), sung by Gilmour to music by Michael Kamen, Gilmour's current pianist and an alumnus of Roger Waters' band (and also the man who paired Guns n' Roses and Metallica with the Philharmonic). Kamen's \\"lite FM\\"-style arrangement is almost muzak, exacerbated by accompanying imagery reminiscent of Japanese karaoke footage, but it's a nice song and an interesting companion to \\"Golden Hair,\\" Syd Barrett's 1970 adaptation of a James Joyce poem.<BR> <BR>Who can ignore the elephant in the living room of any Floyd solo project: What new evidence does this present in theongoing inquisition into \\"Which one is Pink?\\" Gilmour's efforts on this DVD unquestionably make a stronger case for his role in crafting Pink Floyd's sound than does any other project since Waters' departure. The world tours he organized for the fractured Pink Floyd in 1987 and 1994, notwithstanding the awesome spectacle of the stadium shows, would not have sounded substantially different had the band simply left a greatest hits compilation playing on a turntable. Gilmour had seemed to reason that a less guarded performance would have betrayed the band's radical reconstitution and therefore elected to play it safe and assemble a glorified tribute band. Presently Gilmour proves more adventurous, and it pays off, as he demonstrates with \\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\\" that he can interpret the song as authentically when he stands alone with his acoustic guitar (parts I-V) as when he performs it with a well-rehearsed band (parts VI-IX). Gilmour's new material, moreover, is tender and etheral, knit together by lead guitar parts woven with classical meticulousness and perfectly seasoned with background vocal harmonies, plodding percussion, and even Dick Parry's saxophone -- essential properties of Floyd's most characteristic albums. Suddenly it seems that Gilmour's signature on the Pink Floyd sound faded in direct proportion to the increasing responsibility he assumed in the group. When he played sole bandleader, he was barely there, and if that story seems familiar, it proves the timelessness of a certain album and the pertinence of its infinitely recurring question, \\"Isn't this where we came in?\\" Finally, in 2002, David Gilmour has come back to life, and with this concert appears to have broken through his own Wall.
B00006BTCA|5.0|This debut is quite extraordinary (perhaps as impactful as U2 'Boy').  The songs are elegant and complex of craft, with bright, spacious quitars reminiscent of Frank Black of the Pixies.  The bass and drum duo often propel the beat with a Gang of Four style funkiness, all underneath the often commented comparison to Ian Curtis (Joy Division)vocals.  Tracks 'Obstacle 1', 'Stella' and 'The New' rank with the best of U2 in their day, while 'Untitled' and 'Hands Away' are on par with RadioHead circa 'Kid A'. The wonderful CD closer'Leif Erikson' could have been a lost track from Joy Division.  If you liked the Pixies, Gang of Four, Smiths, Furs etc buy this CD.  Album of the year? Maybe, not a bad track on it.  A band to watch.  (Saw them live in NYC and every bit as tight and shimmering as on CD)
B00005JKDR|5.0|I'm a 7th grader, and my class watched this film at school because we had to do a gruelingly hard art project on it...but that's not the point. I agreed with the idea of watching it, basically so we could watch TV instead of studying. I liked Ice Age and Shrek, but this didn't really appeal to me at all. But after watching it, I really liked it. The movie's based towards young kids (obviously), but it would definetly appeal to older kids and even adults. <br />It's just like a big cartoon; very entertaining, even if you don't crack up laughing. It's about Mike and Sully (why is it always so easy to remember character's names in kid's movies?), two monsters, living in their alternate monster world. What are their jobs? Scaring childen. Every child has their own monster, and the monster's job is to scare them every now and then by coming out their closet and doing what monsters do. Well, what humans don't know is that monsters are just as scared of them as they are of them. Monsters fear humans, believing they're intoxicated, poisoned, etc., so when a human baby slips into the Monsters Inc. factory, Sully and Mike hide it the best they can, but, like all things you try to hide, it slips out, and panic covers Monstropolis. It all turns out to be a fun-filled family comedy/cartoon, that everyone will enjoy. Myself? I enjoyed it more than Shrek.
B00005JKZT|5.0|The second part of the The Lord of the Rings trilogy tells what happens to the members of the Fellowship of the Ring after the breaking of their Fellowship.  As the film opens, Sam and Frodo are journeying to Mordor to destroy the ring of power, while Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas search for Mary and Pippin last seen captured by the Uruk-Hai warriors.  I'm happy to say that the Two Towers lives up to expectations and is as good, and in some ways better, than the first.  The Two Towers takes on a darker tone as Middle Earth heads towards war at the hands of Saruman.  Middle Earth literally becomes a battlefield with the epic battle taking place at Helms Deep.  It was reported that it took some three months to film the Helms Deep scenes.  The results are quite spectacular.  Gollum plays a much larger role in this film.  The CGI characterization is fantastic.  An actor played all of Gollums scenes and was later replaced by the CGI character.  The meticulous work here is apparent.  We are also introduced to several new beasts including Wargs, Oliphaunts, and  Fell beasts,  dragon like creatures that serve as the Nazgul's new form of transportation.  Also making a debut is a living, talking tree named Treebeard.  This effect came of great as well, much better then I expected.  Other elements of the film have Aragorn showing his leadership abilities and Frodo feeling the \\"weight\\" of the ring.  The stage is set for next year's Return of the King.  Some of the scenes are a bit \\"scary\\" for young children, thus the PG-13 rating (It's rumored that next years extended edition DVD release will include cut scenes that will require an R rating).  This film is worthy of multiple viewings and is highly recommended.
0671570439|4.0|Jodie Foster does a very nice job reading Carl Sagan's wonderful book, and for those of us who have seen the film, it's easy to imagine her as Dr. Arroway as she leads us through the story. This audio book version, however, is only four cassettes long, and leaves out large chunks of the book, sadly. Still, it's an enjoyable and exciting journey as scientists receive the signal from outer space and rush to decode it. They find multiple layers to the signal, and over time, layers within layers. As the scientists learn that the signal is actually a series of instructions, they must fight many battles, overcoming paranoia and international politics to build The Machine. Finally, the quest for knowledge overcomes even military leaders, and Earth sends five scientists to find out what lies beyond our own small solar system. Their journey, and the answers they find, leads mostly to more questions, and they realize that this is only the first step of a very, very long journey, but that we are not alone in our quest, and that there are many things in the universe humankind never imagined.<br />Fans of the movie will find some elements much different than that adaptation of Sagan's story, though both the film and the book have much to recommend them, and I feel that most people who enjoyed one version will likely enjoy the other - as long as they allow for the inevitable differences that occur between books and movies. I saw the movie first, and read the book second, but still enjoyed both very much.
B00005JKDR|5.0|John Goodman, Billy Crystal; perfect casting! <br />This movie is one that can be enjoyed by the entire family. No potty humor, no gross-out stuff. Just a good ole' fashioned tale of good vs. evil. <br />Goodman's character is a lovable slob-of-a-monster who becomes attached to a little girl. Crystal is perfectly cast as the commonsense, \\"What-are-you-thinking-about?\\" half of the duo. Together they spin a story that is funny and meaningful. One of the few \\"kid-flicks\\" I did not mind seeing over and over. (This is what happens when you buy this DVD for your 12 year old, and 9 year old.)
B000066NW0|5.0|If u like rock and well......all kind of music this is the best cd ever!!! I think u should buy this cd.Its good for everyone old and young!U should really concider buying this track.My favorite song is \\"Anything But Ordanariy\\" that song is like da bomd for people like me I love to push it close to the edge wit everything like even riding my bike screw the bakes!!! Speed all the way. It does make u feal ALIVE and u feel the dangoure.Same thing wit go-karts I am insane I bloiw everyone away so badly its not even funny!!!
B00005JCAA|5.0|Meet Joe Black is a wonderful film, showing that even Death can be as curious as a child. Brad Pitt playing the role of Death, takes a vacation, over-hearing a conversation between a rich and powerful man (Bill) and his lovely daughter (Susan), telling her life is too short not to take a chance. Afterwards, Brad Pitt as still a human man meets Susan and gets caught-up in the moment looking after her as they leave, and getting struck by a car in the middle of the street. Death uses his body as his human form and he makes a deal with Bill. He will extend Bill's life for a while if he gives him a tour of the life Bill spoke of to Susan. The film takes you with Death as he discovers the pains and pleasures of life, developing feelings for Susan, and filling the deal. A movie for both men and women and very good!
B00005JJX8|3.0|The aspect ratio on the DVD is trimmed back from the original Cinemascope for an HD TV look and without any edit-based panning.  Such is never more evident than in the Hitchcock signature scene ...the one on the bus; when the camera (original production technique) scans only slightly from the left (the woman with bird in the cage) past John Roby (Cary Grant) to the viewer's right, Hitch is sitting there, all one-HALF of him !  Actually the VHS version at the 4:3 ratio, and employing pan'n-scan, might be appreciated by viewers as giving a better treatment !
B00003CXZ4|4.0|This movie is one that you must pay attention to. It contains constant flash backs or flash forwards for that matter. The main character (Guy) used to be an insurance investigator, till a tragedy happend in his life. This turned his life around. He suffers from short term memory loss. This is the reason for his many 'notes'. The ending really makes you think twice. The whole movie makes you think twice. It is something that you will need to watch more then once but it is definately worth your time.

B00006RU5B|3.0|All of these people who are reviewing this CD give it 5 stars--I'm sorry, but they are wrong, this CD is mediocre, and that's being generous.  Rage Against the Machine was mainly a rap group, and as  a result, Tom Morello was unable to call as much attention to his amazing guitar abilities as he would have been able to in a pure rock group.  Nevertheless, he managed, in Rage's self-titled album, to create intricate melodies which developed; as time went on, he would settle in on one cool guitar sound and milk it for an entire song--the music was repetitive, while Zack de la Rocha's rapping was incredible.  Here, while Morello has the opportunity to shine, he falls into the same rut he was in near the end of RATM; he uses a few sounds for a very simple but heavy and dissonant song.  He has so much potential, and it is very depressing to see it go to waste.  Cornell is alright as a vocalist, I'm not a huge fan--but face it, the guitar is the backbone in a rock band, and here it s too repetitive.

Although, you get a whopping total of 13 well crafted songs for your money, one of them is garbage (&quot;Mer Girl&quot;) - thus the imperfect score.

0316168815|5.0|I totally enjoyed this book. I was in such a hurry to find out what happens that the nuances of the relationships, although not lost, weren't savored, so I must read it again. Although a bit of the content wasn't appropriate for relay, my very mature 9 year old was riveted by my verbal narrative of the passages I'd read, so over a weekend, I read it and relayed it to him, including the choices and the potential reasons for the choices of the characters. It was a learning opportunity for him into the human experience that I couldn't have created if I'd tried; I was simply so moved by the book that I started telling him about it and he was urging me to read more so that I could tell him more. I will be purchasing this book for people I love to read. It goes into a wide variety of human emotions, choices, and responses - you love nearly all of the characters and if not love, then feel you might understand, the antagonists. It was a beautiful and terribly moving book - I sat and quietly cried in the barber shop while my son got a hair cut, and still couldn't put the book down. I hope you read it.
B00005RHGK|5.0|This is excellent! Another slasher bad guy to add to the list of great ones: Jason Voorhees, Freddy Krueger, Leatherface, The Boogeyman, and Michael Myers. This has got great suspense and it's very scary. Don't know why it is getting bad reviews here? Everyone I've talked to has got scared in it.

0812550706|4.0|Ender's Game is a very good book. I enjoyed reading it. The plot is far fetched, but that's alright because it's a sci-fi book. I thought Ender was a realistic character. He was a very interesting character. The book isn't very hard to read and about 300 pages long. I would recomend this book to anyone who likes sci-fi and some people who don't like it.
B00006V9A0|1.0|There's already a &quot;best of&quot; from Nirvana. It's called From The Muddy Banks Of The Wishkah, it's live and raw and it's the way that Nirvana should be remembered. And don't listen to anyone who says that Bleach and Incesticide are worse, not as good, inferior, lesser blah blah blah than Nevermind etc. etc. Those are words of the &quot;hangers-on&quot;, the ones who started to &quot;like&quot; rock when with Smells Like Teen Spirit a fad called &quot;grunge&quot; was born. They're better! &quot;Grunge&quot;, ladies and gentlemen, is a marketing word for &quot;Indie Rock&quot;, or as Soundgarden's Kim Thayil once put it in an interview: &quot;Grunge died way before we broke up. I don't know when grunge came to be born. As a convenient reference point, grunge might have existed in terms of marketing. It was convenient for retail record stores so that they'd know where to file things. Grunge was a way to sell magazines, not a way to sell music. Grunge was a quick reference point for shoppers.&quot;<br />&quot;Indie Rock&quot;, ladies and gentlemen, was an outgrowth of the heavy metal of the 70's, played in the 80's by people who didn't care about the charts (REM, Sonic Youth, uhh... Nirvana) but this collection seems to be primarily aimed at selling trillions to people who love &quot;grunge&quot; and to keep Ms. Love happy. Bleach and Incesticide (yes, those 2) hardly get a look in, it's all that post-&quot;Spirit&quot;, Unplugged stuff that's included. Blah!!
0446310786|5.0|To Kill A Mockingbird by Harper Lee is by far one of the best books I have read. I can see why it is considered a classic. I read it once before but skipped many parts and I concluded that I really didn't like it. I am glad I chose to read it again because I really feel I understand the message it is trying to send to the reader a lot better. I believe that the ideal audience is for people from about 12 up. It shouldn't be limited to people in high school at all. The book really displayed so much description I really felt that I was a part of the town another neighbor. The plot had many sub-plots that all tied into the main idea of the story about Jem and Scout growing up and learning many new things about the town they live in. I liked every minute of the plot it was exciting at times, like when Jem went to get his pants back also the fire. Then the plot was very heartwarming with Atticus always scooping the children up and really explaining things to them and all the emotions displayed in the court case. Harper Lee was also very thorough with the characterization. You felt like you knew everyone in the town and I really got into the book even more because of it. I also liked how detailed the court case was between Tom Robinson and Mr. Euwell. Harper Lee brought you into the courtroom and showed you Tom's innocence and showed how awful times were back then when the found him guilty. I would definitely recommend this book to everyone it shows every one how two children grow up and learn about themselves.
B000068OSK|5.0|This is just a sick CD packed full of good and catchy songs with those great and crunchy guitar riffs that the White Stripes are famous for.
B000075BFK|5.0|I don't care who is responsible for this material! This is te best collection of 2pac material since &quot;All Eyez On me&quot; and personally I think it is better! Why because both disc are complete and they have something to offer. The beats are tight, The songs are strong and they all have an identity! &quot;Who do you believe in&quot; appears on the second disc a 2 pac classic! My Block (remix) is great the original was already good. The album is extremley entertaining and fullfilling unlike Jay Z's 2 disc set, which only the first is good. The last two 2 pac double disc were complete left over out dated junk! Thanks to Suge &quot;I Guess&quot; He at least cared enough to do the late artist justice this time. I do think next time he should let some famous producers like Rockwilder,Timbaland,Neptunes rework some of the material. if 2 pac was alive today I believe these are the people he would be working with.
B00006NSZ5|5.0|This is the best Soundtrack to come out in a LONG TIME. You can listen to it all the way through with out stopping or skipping tracks!! 50's Tracks are my favorite, 50 spits RAW ridiculous lyrics that have humor too them! I think that Eminem redeems himself in my eyes on this album. His lyrics weren't as strong as they were but on this album They Are RIDICULOUS! Rakim makes a strong come back! Nas and Jay's Tracks are hot! The whole album Is off the CHAIN! Cop IT
B00005JKGV|5.0|I don't understand why everyone has a hard time interpreting this film. Here is the simple philosopical plot alright! Patrica Arquette plays Renee Madison Fred Madison (Bill Pullman)Wife. Fred Madison is obcessed with her..so obcessed that he can't even hold his end of the bargain in bed. She isn't obviously a true Human being and several clues reveal that in the movie. She is also cheating on him and he suspects it. Also there is another person in the movie (Short Guy with a Pale Face) which really would be considered the Devil or a deciple of. His face was also seen in the film emerged with hers..one can only figure they are the same person because they are never seen in the same frame. Fred goes to Prison for the murder of his wife which he didn't commit. But for some reason he is being tortured by the devil you can only suspect. He tranformes into a guy that was killed on the highway the night before and was released from prison. Renee comes back but only this time her name is Alice to reak havoc on his existance again. Does Pete/Fred fall for her again ? Yes he does and he ends up right back were he started! He kills several people for the obcession of her and later finds out she really doesn't exist. Also he finds out who she really is in the cabin. The key to this movie is ...Haven't we met before? At your House remember? Basically this is a struggle of Obcession over a woman that is extremley sexy and attractive. Obviously we have all been there but I think not to this extent. This movie just shows that when you worship something more than your self ..were it can get you. The movie has a lot of twist and turns and unexplained portions and questions to be pondered over. Over all though it is a great movie ...Fred Madison just was a tormented man that didn't love himself and obcessed with a woman that was basically the devil and he paid for it ..and was sentenced to Hell on earth. Alice wigfield and Renee Madison are both played by Patricia Arquette. Fred Madison also finds out that Alice is Renee and that she never loved or cared about him in the end. She is an extreme product of deception,Manipulation and evil. There are even Hints in the movie were Alice is on screen doing a porno with Marilyn Mansion. Get ready for the ride of your life...I hope this explains this film to you i ful retrospect! If anyone agrees after watching let me know!
B00005JKZT|5.0|We are in the middle of what is almost certain to be the greatest film adaptation of a book in the history of cinema.<br />The Two Towers proves that what Peter Jackson et. al. accomplished in The Fellowship of the Ring was no fluke:  Same absolute tracking with the essentials of Tolkien's story and message (most tellingly revealed when the Elvish forces show up at Helm's Deep to offer their meager but essential support and renew old alliances and pay off old debts); same brilliant portrayal of Aragorn as a man of destiny, yet haunted by his human finitude (I love how they did his relationship to Eomir); same sense of loss and longing, especially in the achingly poignant scenes with Elrond and Arwin; same sweep and grandeur, most telling on display in the mind-boggling battle scenes at Helm's Deep; and (perhaps the key to Jackson's success) same willingness to forego mere cinematic artistry and instead aim for a deep integrity of filmic transposition.<br />In some ways, The Two Towers is an even greater achievement than the first installment.  As with many trilogies, the second book of LOTR sags.  It is essentially a bridge between books one and three.  How to punch it up to make it play on the screen?  That must've been the filmmaker's greatest problem to solve.  And, with one significant exception, he brilliantly solved it.  Even where the film stumbles slightly--the decision to recast Faramir as one tempted by the ring as was his brother Boromir--one sees that it was done to add drama to what is otherwise a more elegiac scene, something that would be difficult to convincingly portray as film.  But Jackson's slight change in adding weight and agency to Saruman pays off huge here.  And his rendering of Grima Wormtongue--along with the transformation of Theoden--is a very fine achievement.<br />All in all, I have nothing but admiration for this project.  Highest recommendation.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|A must see for every teenager in america, for everyone in america, and everywhere in the world.  The best movie I have ever seen and its a shame how it was robbed out of Oscars by picks such as Traffic, and Erin Brocovich (wow.)  Unofficial Best Picture winner over Gladiator and the best movie I've ever seen.
0066214122|2.0|My major complaint with this novel is that it's pretty obvious that Crichton never once actually ran this past someone who is experienced with the electronics side of nanotechnology.  From about page 70 I started nearly screaming -- \\"so when are you [guys] going to construct an EMP generator\\"?  The idea of disrupting the silicon parts of the nanotechnological beasties is something that never occurs to any of the supposedly technologically savvy types in the book.  The fact that the \\"final\\" solution was totally biological in nature just shows the author's lack of training or knowledge in this area...

B000002KDB|5.0|This is Emmylou Harris' debut solo album, released in 1975 titled PIECES OF THE SKY. &quot;Bluebird Wine&quot; starts off the album, its a nice bluegrass/traditional country tinged song that will get your toes tapping. &quot;Too Far Gone&quot; is a favorite of mine, her first hit record too. She sings with so much remorse and passion in this song especially. Her rendition of the Louvin Brothers' &quot;If I Could Only Win Your Love&quot; is inspired, another highlight of the album. &quot;Boulder to Birmingham&quot; has become only one of her signature tunes, but it's one of her best as well. It is a tribute to Gram Parsons, who helped her get her career started. She also manages a cover of Merle Haggard's &quot;Bottle Let Me Down&quot;. She does a wonderful version of Dolly Parton's &quot;Coat of Many Colors&quot; here as well, and Shel Silverstein's &quot;Queen of the Silver Dollar&quot;. Another impressive song is &quot;For No One&quot;, penned by Lennon and McCartney. Overall its a strong debut album, definately essential for any Emmylou Harris collection.
6305428425|5.0|This movie is very cute, and airy on the surface, but it also illustrates the cruelty of high school. (If you don't recognize and remember this cruelty from your own high school, you WERE one of the cruel ones!) There is more to this film than you may wish to see. Or, you can just enjoy it for the fun on the surface.<br />Romy and Michele don't seem to have progressed far since their high school days, so they invent fake lives. Of course, when you invent a whole new life on little notice, there are bound to be holes, and you are bound to get caught, as they are. There are charming sequences from the heads of both women, of how they hope things will go.<br />By the end, if you step back and look, Romy and Michele have gone through quite a bit of growth. When you look at some of the people who were on the most likely to succeed, you can see that they simply stagnated. Those often labeled as most likely to succeed are those who peak in high school. It must be a sad fate to have the high point of your life so early. It was great to see some of what had been the popular clique outgrow their previous friends, and see the merits of those previously 'below them'.<br />This is a fun movie if you are already out of school, and may give some hope to those still in the grueling experience of high school. Life does get better, once you are outside of that artificial world of school.

0151008116|3.0|The life of Pi is an entertaining read, with beautiful imagery and description. I do not consider it masterful, though. As a parable it has some interesting elements (e.g. Pi being his mind's ring-master), but it spends inordinate amounts of time on detail irrelevant to the message. The final conclusion seems to be that the world is a terrible place and we are justified to make up our gods so we can (a) escape reality, (b) indulge ourselves to embellishment or (c) make it easier to tolerate.<BR>Neither are convincing arguments (not that any real arguments are mounted in the book), although I have some sympathy with (c), since our experience reality is subjective.
B00005JKZT|5.0|After a year of anticipation, increasingly intense with each day of waiting, each spoiler revealed, and each rave early review read, the second part of LOTR has finally arrived. As a wary filmgoer who seldom wastes money on current cineplex junk, I was naturally concerned whether this colossal undertaking will live up to my expectations, let alone its equally collossal hype.<br />Perhaps, The Two Towers is an easier book to adapt cinematically, because it is more action-based, and its main events occur during a more condensed time period - weeks as opposed to months or years. On the other hand, it creates greater challenges in terms of intercutting between three separate storylines. Peter Jackson does a near-flawless job facing up to these challenges, and largely succeeds. The flaws are still there, but they are less jarring. The \\"gloom and doom\\" yet hopeful spirit of Tolkien's second book is present in spades, and again - painstalking detail is lavished on all visual aspects of Middle Earth.<br />Now, the usual discussion of strengths and weaknesses - and the latter are definitely fewer this time around.<br />WARNING - POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!<br />-----------------------------------------------<br />THE GOOD:<br />1) My favorite character in the entire book was always Gollum, and Jackson's team along with Andy Serkis absolutely nail him. He is best acted and most complex of all, a feat for a CGI creature. As another reviewer said, \\"Jar-Jar is not fit to lick Gollum's ***\\", a view which I wholeheartedly agree with. When Gollum/Serkis remembers his past as Smeagol, the moment alone is worth the price of admission. Personalit(ies) indeed go a long way. Nearly every scene in the book that featured Gollum is reproduced here, with great accuracy, even the \\"rabbit stew\\" scene! The final scene of the film is extremely effective, possibly one of the finest.<br />2) Gimli - yes, he is largely relegated to necessary comic relief, but he is funny, not laughable. His character is actually well realized, because a Dwarf would truly feel like a fish out of water in such foreign surroundings. He also gets to save the day more than a few times. I have a feeling he'll have even more to say and do in the Extended DVD.<br />3) Merry and Pippin display passion and wit, taking their development further.<br />4)The movie is historically/geographically minded, and handles various new places and concepts well. The fans even get references to the Bombadil Story omitted from FOTR - the Old Forest and the Barrow-Whigths (Gollum sings their song). All of the landscapes are gorgeous, and 100% Alan Lee.<br />5) Of course, the epic feel is tremendous and the action spectacular. It is unneeded to even mention. At times it seemed like I was watching something out of the Iliad.<br />THE NOT-SO-BAD:<br />1) Arwen and Aragorn came off well, at least non-distracting. The sequence of Arwen mourning and wandering the woods alone was starltingly beautiful.<br />2) Faramir I never cared much about, so his motivation changes did not bother me. The actor playing him was not very strong however, and didn't impress me. Good thing he had little screen time.<br />3) Treebeard was decent, not quite as I would have liked but in the context of the film, the ents worked. I know that they will get additional scenes in the DVD from Jackson's interview. Their scenes appeared choppy. The Destruction of Isengard, though, was magnificent - goosebump-worthy.<br />4) The music was still excessive, but better. The Rohan theme was more pleasing to the ear than any pseudo-Titanic pap.<br />THE NOT-SO-GOOD:<br />1) The Rohan \\"women and children\\" storyline. Used purely for dramatic purposes, cheesy and worn-out. Could have done without it.<br />2) Sam's long speech about heroic endurance at the end needed some editing. Jackson is not a director known for subtelty.<br />3) Haldir's real death and Aragorn's fake one were overdone (slow-motion bathos syndrome) , but that is a fairly minorcomplaint.<br />4) CGI was spotty in places (the wargs and oliphaunts come to mind), but not enough to ruin the scenes. In fact, none the action scenes falter much.<br />------------------------------------------------------------<br />In closing, I am pleased that TTT not only lived up to the hype/expectations, but managed to exceed them on almost all accounts. A gleeful smile has hardly left my face in all 3 hours, and my expression changed to an annoyed cringe only once or twice - far less than during Fellowship. I have to say that this film was the one (in the Sci-Fi/Fantasy genre) that I enjoyed the most ever since the good old days of the original Star Wars Trilogy, and I do not say that lightly.r complaint.<br />4) CGI was spotty in places (the wargs and oliphaunts come to mind), but not enough to ruin the scenes.

B00006M183|5.0|Pearl Jam may truly be one of musics most underrated and underappreciated bands.  Even though they have outlasted every single one of their &quot;grunge&quot; peers, the praise that they deserve always seems out of their reach.  Sure, the band was plastered all over magazine covers and TV screens with their landmark debut &quot;TEN&quot;, but all subsequent albums seem to have been met with mild (or heavy) disappointment.  &quot;They really lost it after Ten.&quot;  Well, the truth is, Ten was the beginning of this groups genesis.  Although regarded as their best album, it is actually only their catchiest, their poppiest.  RIOT ACT, in contrast, is one of their most cohesive and complete albums ever.  The thing that makes Pearl Jam a truly great rock band is their defiance of modern rock trends.  They yield only to their own ambitions.  No two albums are alike.  This one is no exception.  <BR>Riot Act contains elements from all members of the band, both individually and collectively that absolutely define what Pearl Jam is and was.  More so than any other album, this record encapsulates all of the bands varied styles and throws them into one massive ensemblage.  Here is the rundown on what will be found upon listening to this album.<br />1)  The underappreciated, blues-invigorated guitar work of Mike McCready.  This guitarist uses Hendrix and Vaughn inspired techniques in his soloing.  This album actually includes more solos (and better solos) than TEN.  Mike is what gives this band its &quot;classic rock&quot; flavor.<br />2) the inspired drumming of Matt Cameron.  If you are familiar with Soundgarden, you already know what I am talking about.  If not, then you should know that Matt adds a truly Bonham-esque flavor to many of the tracks on Riot Act.  The &quot;lead drumming&quot; technique is more than just a time-keeper, it fuels the feel of each and every track.  <br />3) bass soloing by Jeff Ament.  Jeff and Matt make a great back-beat for this band, having improved in communication since 2000's Binaural.<br />4) Ed's voice and lyrics.  His voice may be more conservative in volume than on earlier albums, but his intensity and soul has never been better.  Proof that volume doesnt neccesarily equate feeling.  <br />5) amazing diversity.  This is truly where the strength of Pearl Jam lies.  This band has one of the most diverse catalogues in all of music.  This is why the band continues to defy convention and confound critics.  Drawing inspiration from Fugazi, Hendrix, the Ramones, Talking Heads, Sigor Ros, Led Zeppelin, and others, this band is truly visionary.  Sooner or later (probably later) this band will attain the praise that it deserves, but we all know that they dont really worry about that.  They just rock on and make their music the way they feel it.  They wouldn't have it any other way.
B000002UA9|4.0|Yes, it's good, yes I love the Beatles, but this and other<BR>early Beatles albums give the most influential band in history<BR>a bad reputation as another boy band.<br />It is worth having though if you know you like the Beatles, and <BR>aren't a new fan. <br />The first cut, \\"I Saw Her Standing There\\" is one of the album's<BR>highlights. \\"Misery\\",\\"Chains\\",\\"Boys\\",and\\"Ask Me Why\\" are all<BR>early '60's pop standards. \\"Please Please Me\\"and \\"Love Me Do\\"<BR>two of the original Lennon/McCartney's on this LP are good as<BR>well. \\"PS I Love You\\" is pretty Beach Boyesque and thus<BR>it is horrid. \\"Baby It's You\\",\\"Do You Want To Know A Secret\\",<BR>and \\"A Taste of Honey\\" are also standard for the time. <BR>\\"There's A Place\\" gives a very small peek into future songs<BR>and \\"Twist and Shout\\" the best song on the album is another<BR>cover of a '50's hit. <br />Overall not bad but if the Beatles would have broken up after<BR>\\"HELP!\\" than they would be just another name in the plethora<BR>of British invasion bands.

B000002UAF|1.0|I love the Beatles, I own all their albums, but I NEVER listen to<BR>this one!<br />There are SOME good songs like \\"A Hard Day's Night\\", \\"I Should<BR>Have Known Better\\" and \\"Can't Buy Me Love\\".<br />The truth is is that aside from these songs the album cover<BR>is the best part.<br />My problem with this album is that almost all of the songs<BR>sound like filler tracks or the Beatles trying to be the Kinks,<BR>not the Beatles, which is what they were good at. If you're<BR>new to the Beatles and this was the first album of theirs you<BR>bought, don't be discouraged, go buy the Blue Album.<br />The preformance quality on these songs isn't good. The Beatles sound like they did this disc just to take commercial advantage of the movie. They don't sound energetic on more than half of the tracks, and most of the songs have no meaning and are pointless.<BR>Most are two minute half-effort run throughs that make the listener bored. If the group were to record this album with the same songs even two years later,it would've been better but they sound like a fish out of water. <BR>         I think their songwriting wasn't completly developed at that time, notice they did cover tracks on the next album, also notice how much more sincere that one sounds. If this was the band's only or first album they would've never made it. They sound like the Monkees here! This is terrible, I'm sorry you guys can't stand me criticizing a Beatle's album, but this is the worst (trust me, I have all of their albums).<BR>          Poor playing, manufactured sound, bad album.
0060194995|5.0|To Kill A Mockingbird was a very well written book.  It has every element needed to get where it has gotten.  It has many literary techniques and terms used in it.  This book has stood the test of time and there are very many reasons for it.<BR> This book is about a family who goes through many hard times and deals with many hard issues like racism, family problems, and to deal with the loss of something.  But after all is said and done they stick together and prevail over all.  <BR> It has very many well-written and obvious literary terms inside the book.  Characterization was a big concept used.  As the story went on you felt like you were actually with the characters as they played there games or as they were in the courtroom, you got the feeling you were right there with them.  Theme was another important one.  Many themes showed up in this book and a couple were obvious.  You have the easy one, racism, and you also have the little ones that you had to catch throughout the book.  Like how reading is important and it enhances the mind.  Also how you should walk a mile in someone else's shoes before you judge them.  <BR> This book has stood the test of time and in my opinion everyone should take the time to read it.  I recommend this book to everyone who likes to read and even people who don't because the book offers great reading material and good lessons to be learned.<BR> At this time I really couldn't find anything wrong with this well written novel.  Sometimes I just wish she had written another book.  I really enjoyed this book and I really didn't want it to end.
B000002UAU|4.0|This WAS the Beatle's best album when it came out, and it's still good but not as good as say, \\"Abbey Road\\" or \\"The White Album\\", or even \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\". Let's have a look...<BR>1.\\"Sgt.

B00006J9OT|5.0|LIVE IN PARIS reveals what Diana Krall fans have known for quite some time: that in addition to being an exquisite vocal interpreter, she is even better on piano.    The opening track I LOVE BEING HERE WITH YOU (composed by another great vocalist-composer, Peggy Lee and William Schluger), delivers a swing that was last heard on Krall's earlier recording \\"ALL FOR YOU-A Dedication to the Nat King Cole Trio\\".  Krall is a Cole-descendant of the highest order and displays her piano virtuosity throughout this set.      The Nat King Cole Trio chestnut \\"DEVIL MAY CARE\\" begins with a   mid-tempo and rather intricate piano intro that eases into a decidedly up-tempo crossbreeding of Bop and Swing.  This particular piece delivers a virtuoso and substantial guitar solo by Anthony Wilson, followed by Krall's throbbing performance on piano, followed by Jeff Hamilton's rigorous drum solo, all backed by Paulinho DaCosta's percussion and John Clayton's bass.  This piece, as all of the selections on this CD, are  improvements over many of her original studio recordings, which may say more about Record Company Executive meddling than Krall's own particular preferences.  Although Krall remains superb here as a vocalist, there is more of her on piano-a refreshing shift from her other recordings that focus primarily on her smokey vocals.    Nat King Cole's piano playing influenced several generations of musicians, but only Jazz enthusiasts truly celebrate and indulge themselves in the stellar recordings of the Nat King Cole Trio where Nat made the piano keys talk!  While no one with ears can complain about Cole's rich vocal ability, his singing eventually eclipsed his unique piano technique; LIVE IN PARIS is the recording that may prevent Krall from a similar fate.  Krall, the pianist, is HERE!  And the pianist delivers plenty!
B000002UAO|5.0|This album shows a great increase in musical maturity since,\\"HELP!\\" which was good, but had too much filler. Sometimes known as the \\"Ultimate Beatles Album\\" or the \\"Pot Album\\" this shows great development in their songwriting abillity and vindication for George and Ringo's semi-cheesey preformances on the previous album.<br />Though it doesn't contain any #1 singles it is a great album.
0451160916|5.0|This is Stephen King's classic horror novel.  I read many of his books and The Shining is by far one of the best.  It was the first book of his that I read and it got me hooked.  Once you get into the story you cannot put it down.  It keeps your attention and shocks you to the very end!  If you've seen the movie, it does not do justice to the book.  It was a very well done film, yet much of the plot line was changed.  <BR>In my opinion, only several of King's books can compare with The Shining (Dreamcatcher, It, or the Dark Tower Series).  This was an excelent novel and I would highly recomended to anyone.
B000002UAI|4.0|In my opinion a great improvement from \\"A Hard Day's Night\\".<br />Like the \\"White Album\\" the good songs make up for terrible fillers... let's take a look...<br />1.\\"No Reply\\"-a nice opener and a good prefromance by John.<BR>2.\\"I'm A Looser\\"-not a looser, a nice follow up to \\"No Reply\\"<BR>3.\\"Baby's In Black\\"-good guitar playing and unique vocals,not<BR>bad!<BR>4.\\"Rock and Roll Music\\"-better than the original by far.<BR>5.\\"I'll Follow the Sun\\"-a nice ballad, much more serious.<BR>6.\\"Mr.Moonlight\\"-umm...NO!<BR>7.\\"Kansas City\\"-a fun version of this song with great vocal<BR>efforts by Paul.<BR>8.\\"Eight Day's A Week\\"-like the first three, only better.\\"<BR>-now it gets ugly-<BR>9.\\"Words Of Love\\"-one word-hide.<BR>10.\\"Honey Don't\\"-see number six,only add a few more no's.<BR>11.\\"Every Little Thing\\"-BORING!!!<BR>12.\\"I Don't Want To Spoil the Party\\"-well it sure did!<BR>13.\\"What You're Doing\\"-...is ruining the album.<BR>14.\\"Everybody's Trying To Be My Baby\\" the best part of side B.<br />So there's my opinion-half is great, which makes up for the bad<BR>half!
0425098478|5.0|Don't be put off by the salesman-like boasting style of this book. The story it tells sounds all-too simple, but the lessons it teaches are among the best I have ever received, and they can be adapted to meet one's personal style. One of the good things about it is that you can try out most of what the book suggests without further preparation, provided that you are in a managing position and that you are respected by the people you work with. If not, you know at least what your boss SHOULD be like.
B000002UDB|5.0|This is by far the Beatles best album. I like it because<BR>the band plays together well and they all seem to be on<BR>the same page. Unlike \\"Sgt.Pepper\\" which has a song about<BR>a circus right before a song about eastern religion.<br />Furthermore they used the sound effects more sparingly and<BR>quite a bit more carefully and thoughtfully too, unlike the<BR>strange-noise-laden fare on \\"Sgt.Pepper\\". The effects really<BR>add to the weird atmosphere and all the music seems strangely<BR>connected. A real gem!!!
B00006LSM3|5.0|Not much to say other than let the album speak for itself.  It'll hold up. His best work as a lyricist. Ever. Excellent slide work (again, his best). Vocals weak in one or two places (for obvious reasons, though not as weak as might be expected).  You don't have to be a Harrison fan to enjoy this one - just a fan of superb songwriting and musicianship. Solid from start to finish.
B000002UAR|5.0|This is easily one of the Beatle's best albums even better than<BR>Sgt.Pepper.<br />This was the first post touring album which saw the Beatles go<BR>in a more experimental direction. This is an excellent album<BR>and is worth your time, and money!
B00005JL78|5.0|This is a movie that I was unfortunately unable to see at the theaters and regretted it then and even more so now, seeing how great a movie it is.  You can normally expect a Steven Spielberg film to contain; stunning imagery, intense suspense and an overly enthralling film, which he delivers perfectly in this film.  Minority Report is an absolutely riveting film that will have you going from the moment the film starts to the very last second.  Tom Cruise's more recent films really haven't really lived up to expectations, not so in this film.  He seems to be completely in his stride with this role.  He performs brilliantly in this film.  Nods to Max Von Sydow as well.  If you're into action/mystery films with a good dose of Science Fiction tossed in for good measure, this is your film.  Minority Report is a must for your DVD collection!<br />The premise:<br />It is the year 2054 and the film takes place in Washington D. C.  For the past several years, murder is all but a thing of the past.  With the advent of the Pre Crime division, where three pre-cogs, see a murder before it happens.  Tom Cruise plays the chief of the Pre Crimes division, leading the troops in the apprehension of these criminals who haven't, yet are about to commit murder.  His character is plagued by the murder of his son, six years prior and is suffering the emotional damage from that murder.  The pre-cogs, foretell a murder and as Tom Cruise is working his amazing futuristic computer to discover who the murderer is, he finds that it is he who is the murderer.  And so goes the film as he makes his way out of the Pre Crime building and starts on his quest to figure out who has set him up.
B000002UAC|4.0|This is the second British Beatles album released. Like<BR>its counterpart it is a standard early '60's album, but<BR>it's better than the first because it is less sentimental.<br />\\"It Won't Be Long\\" starts off this LP strong like the first<BR>one did only the song is better. \\"All I've Got To Do\\" is just<BR>a filler but its a good one. \\"All My Loving\\" is one of Paul's<BR>best songs and he still plays it at concerts today! \\"Don't<BR>Bother Me\\" is just a prelude to Harrison's writing, and<BR>\\"Little Child\\" is a dumb filler. \\"Till There Was You\\" is<BR>really corny and annoying. \\"Please Mister Postman\\" and<BR>\\"Roll Over Beethoven\\" are both covers but are as good as some<BR>of the originals on this set. \\"Hold Me Tight\\" and the lousy<BR>tragic love song \\"You Really Got a Hold On Me\\" are crumby fillers. Ringo's vocals on \\"I Wanna Be Your Man\\" aren't as<BR>good as his vocals on \\"Boys\\" but aren't hideous. \\"Devil In<BR>Her Heart\\" was good but the album finishes weakly with \\"Not<BR>A Second Time\\" and a terrible cover of \\"Money\\".<br />This is better than the first but not much. Another standard<BR>'60's pop work.
B00007E8O5|5.0|This 2-disc set is a must-have for Jerry Cantrell fans. I thoroughly enjoyed the original release of Degradation Trip earlier this year, but was simply blown away by the recent album, all 25 songs released as Jerry originally intended. I simply can't get enough of it. His honest, raw, wear-your-heart-on-your-sleeve lyrics are just breathtaking. This man truly writes from the heart. Musically, Jerry returns to his Alice roots, but with his own spin. The trademark haunting harmonies, chanting, humming and crunching guitar riffs are there in all their splendor. Jerry Cantrell also is a master of dichotomy. The song Pig Charmer, a brutally honest assessment of rock-star living, is at once chilling and catchy. The lyrics almost make me want to crawl out of my skin at the same time I am singing the catchy chorus. The instrumental Hurts Don't It is a masterpiece of raw emotion. The man has a way of making the guitar speak to you. It's really a crime that RoadRunner records has not done more to promote what I think is hands down THE best rock album of the year. It's a refreshing change from most of the prefab garbage that gets the air play and promotion. Shame on RR for not doing a better job with one of the most influential guitarists/writers of our time. Take the trip. You'll be glad you did.
B000002UAX|4.0|Let me just say this is the Beatles' best album. It has almost every kind of music avaliable! Let's have a look...<br />The album starts off with \\"Back in the USSR\\", a quirky song with Beach Boy harmonies and even some Russian lyrics. It starts off with and fades out to airplane noises. Then comes John's \\"Dear Prudence\\", a truly great Lennon work that sounds like it's from a Plastic Ono Band album. Next is the tounge-in-cheek \\"Glass Onion\\". Here John pokes some fun at people who read too much into the Beatles aura. The next song \\"Ob-La-Di,Ob-La-Da\\" is classified by some as Reggae. An interesting ditty by Paul, tells the story of a young couple in love and getting married, etc... Next is the absurd \\"Wild Honey Pie\\" which is sadly only a little over a minute. The next track, \\"The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill\\" features a solo by Yoko (which, thankfully only lasts two lines).It is supposedly about a man that John saw on a TV safari.<BR>George also brings in a guest, only he picks a better one. Eric Clapton plays guitar on \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\", arguably one of George's best songs. It is followed by \\"Happiness Is A Warm Gun\\", the title of which John got from a magazine. It is a weird song, very Lennon. Then is Paul's \\"Martha My Dear:, about his large Sheepdog, yes you read right, his sheepdog. \\"I'm So Tired\\" is much in the form of \\"Happiness is a Warm Gun\\" and leads into the folky \\"Blackbird\\", one of Paul's best, and one he still sings on tour today. \\"Piggies\\" is some political/social commentary on the upper class by George, where the 'piggies' turn out to be cannibals. \\"Rocky Racoon\\" is about a wandering lover who gets her <BR>friend killed. \\"Don't Pass Me By\\" is a countryesque song by Ringo, his first writing adventure, not bad! Then is Paul's \\"Why Don't We Do It In The Road?\\" on which only he and Ringo play. The disc is rounded off with \\"I Will\\", a short sentimental ditty, and an ode to John's mother with \\"Julia\\".<br />Disc two kicks off excellently with\\"Birthday\\" an excellent rocking party song by Paul. John's bone crunching \\"Yer Blues\\", which is by far my favorite from this album, featuring great guitar work by both John and George, and some suicidal lyrics conjured up on their medatation trip to India. \\"Mother Nature's Son\\" is a great folk tune by none other thatn Paul McCartney, and the practically unheard of, \\"Everybody's Got Something To Hide Except Me and My Monkey\\" shows the Beatles can rock just like the Stones and the Who. \\"Sexy Sadie\\" is John's lament about the final turnout of their trip to India, Paul follows up the mood with the pure metal \\"Helter Skelter\\" written to out-rock the Who, according to Paul. George's \\"Long,Long,Long\\" mellows out with words about lost love. \\"Revolution 1\\" picks up again where \\"Sadie\\" and \\"Helter Skelter\\" left off, a folk/rock version of the \\"Hey Jude\\" B-side. \\"Honey Pie\\" is Paul responding to John's complaints about his \\"granny songs\\", to which this song directly belongs. \\"Savoy Truffle\\" is written around the names of chocolate truffles. A good Harrison recording that has been nearly forgotten. \\"Cry Baby Cry\\" marks the beginning of the part where you no longer need to pay attention, and most of the reason that <BR>not everybody gave this CD only four stars, it dulls down the disc and doesn't have any apparent meaning. \\"Revolution 9\\" is for Lennon freaks only (yes, I'm one too, it's ok) and many say it should've been saved for \\"Two Virgins\\". \\"Good Night\\" is an over sentimenal ditty crooned by Ringo. This disc has some lows, but is definatly worth a look. Buy it now.
B00003CWL6|5.0|For starters, I deem it an amazing achievement to put this movie down, as has become the current vogue at amazon[.com] reviews of American beauty. With the exception of Carl Dreyers \\"The passion of Joan of Arc\\" from 1928, I have never seen a film that works on so many levels simultaneously. From the title itself, multiple meanings melt into one coherent whole. The film`s detractors point out single scenes, like Carolyns house selling scene, but this is like focussing on a part of one arm of a snowflake, and commenting on how ragged and unsymmetric it is. One can detract the film if staying in the surface view, but I find the undercurrents flowing with an internal logic that grips emotionally and ultimately uplifts.<br />American Beauty is the amazing directorial debut of theater man Sam Mendes. Penned by TV writer Alan Ball, the script may feel like a sitcomish satire of suburban hell at first, but beyond the laughs lurks a fascinating exploration of people trying to convince themselves they're not as miserable as they really are. It's also somehow a tragedy, as we're told right off that fatality will strike. Mendes makes great use of the possibilities of cinema. His film is always interesting and inventive visually, in an almost impressionistic way. Among other things, he makes very interesting use of American beauties, a variety of red roses that the wife cultivates and which Lester links to his fantasies. I also love the score by Thomas Newman, who should have one an Oscar, and the cast is as good as it gets. Annette Bening is convincing as always as an apparently successful career woman whose facade is shattering, and like Peter Gallagher's, her character is a bit caricatural but still effective. Thora Birch is perfect as her confused daughter, and so is Mena Suvari as her babe girlfriend. Suvari (who was one of the best things in American Pie) is highly desirable at first, then she starts talking and gets obnoxious, but eventually you get to really know her character and she's just another sad kid. This is a surprising performance and so is the one delivered by Wes Bentley, who's got solid screen presence and charisma as Ricky. He's able to really grab your attention and toy with your expectations, maybe disturb you a little but ultimately impress you with his focused mind.<br />Last but not least is Kevin Spacey, who really deserved his Oscar for his astonishing portrayal of a man who spins his life around. It's just so exhilarating to watch him gain confidence and retrieve hope in life. Spacey has done great work in the past, but this might be the role that he'll be remembered for. He goes through many different states of mind and behaviors in the film, yet Spacey makes it feel all natural. This is one of those performances that sticks with you and inspire you. And then there's Spacey's \\"got nothing to lose\\" attitude and return to an adolescent mind state which is hilarious! It's always fun to watch someone being a smartass and making uptight types speechless for once. <BR>I'm personally grateful to any picture that gives me a new respect for life. <br />American Beauty is one of my all-time favorite pictures. It carries wit, beauty, compassion in the undercurrent.<BR>All the undercurrents of the film terminate in the final sentences, that I personally carry as a staement of life and an upliftment that has affected my everyday life. Can a movie do more?
B000067CPX|5.0|This is one of the best CDs I've ever listened to.  It's great!
B0000691TJ|5.0|The Ramones have changed the world. This, their 1984 outing, is nothing short of what you would expect from these New York Natives. This album is one of my favorites of all time. The hits keep coming and then, just when you thought that you were getting the best pop record ever Dee Dee pops up and sings a few and puts it in as a tough guy record. <BR>The one bit of advice i would give is to pick up one of the first four ( My pick would be Rocket to Russia or Road to Ruin, personally) and listen to that as well, because those records are insane good. Pure Genious. Oh and Halfway to Sanity wasnt bad either.
1573229725|5.0|As an avid reader, seldom to I find myself COMPLETELY AMAZED by a plot twist! I turned a page of this book and was thoroughly astounded by the curveball Waters threw. Phenomenal surprises until the very last pages. Brilliant historical read.
B00005ASQ1|5.0|Those who want high-pitched excitement would not like this story. Those who look for romantic love might also be disappointed. But those of us who prefer to be caught up in a quiet but insistent drama of two unlikely characters will find rewards aplenty. The veteran actor plays WITH the young actor to create a memorable story that touches on racism, snobbish academia, justice of various kinds, and dreams held by young and old. I cannot help thinking of J.D. Salinger as the writer. The best thing about the movie is that it bears repeating and repeating and repeating.
B000060P79|5.0|This is just another pop punk band.. But I like how the CD sounds.. Their lyrics are good and they have good voices w/ catchy songs. My favorite song on the album is &quot;Perfect&quot;.. It's a great song w/ great lyrics.. But again, they sound similar to a lot of other bands.. But still I recommend buying the CD.. It's really good :)

So his teacher valinters him for the test and in the testing he as to race a mouse through a maze. This book relates to my life be cause sometimes I wish I was smarter.

0316666343|5.0|Sebold weaves a fascinating tale of love, loss, and curiosity through the eyes of Susie Salmon.  The book is an A++ from the very first page; it is a classic in the making.
B00006CXXU|4.0|Back in 1999, the world was introduced to a cute, bubbly teen by the name of Christina Aguilera. She fit in great with Britney Spears and the Backstreet Boys who were already dominating the pop charts. She had nice pop songs and seemed like a sweet, genuine person. Now all of a sudden, she decides that that wasn't the real her. The real her is a naked, pierced, slang talking recreation of the old Christina...hmmm. Didn't mariah Carey do something similar back in 1997? Whatever. But the music is what is important and \\"Stripped\\" definitely stands out musically. \\"Walk Away\\" is a gorgeous piano ballad and sounds like something straight out of the 1940's. \\"Fighter\\" is a stand-out track with a catchy chorus and good message. \\"Infatuation\\" is perhaps a glimpse of the old Christina from 1999-2000 and is a good pop song. \\"Beautiful\\" is quickly becoming a huge pop smash. The ballad carries a good message and offers great vocals from Christina, but I find it rather boring. Nothing outstanding. \\"Dirrty\\" was the first single and is an awesome party song and is a cool song over-all *despite the disgusting music video.* The last three tracks are where Christina really shines. \\"The Voice Within\\" is a beautiful ballad with an awesome message. \\"I'm Ok\\" is a sad reflection on a troubled childhood. \\"Keep On Singing My Song\\" is a nice closing, but is ridiculously long. Four minutes would have been sufficent. <br />Other tracks like \\"Loving Me 4 Me\\" and \\"Impossible\\" are rather boring and don't add too much to the album. They could've been left off. Overall, good listen. Try to ignore the appalling image and concentrate on the music.
B00005JKZT|5.0|This is a perfect sequal to The Fellowship. It keeps to the book well, but is also well cut to fit into a three hour movie. It deffinitely doesn't seem like a three hour movie either; by the time it is over everyone is thinking \\"but they can't finish it there! there has to be more!\\" The acting is just as spectacular as in the first film, and the music is just different enough to be new but still has some threads of the old soundtrack to string the two movies together. The special effects are beyond compare, just as in the first film, and the cinematography is fantastic. This movie is quite a bit more dark than the first one (what can you expect though, Frodo and Sam are getting closer to Mordor, and the rest of the company is just starting to fight the huge battle against Sauron)but there are bleeps of comic relief, oddly enough, most coming from Gollum. I was afraid Treebeard and Gollum would look ridiculously fake and silly, but I was pleasantly surprised by Treebeard realistic Entness and Gollum's realistic creepiness. Can you tell I loved the movie? It was fantastic and I will probably end up seeing it 10 times before it leaves the theatre, just like I saw The Fellowship;0). Everyone should see it!!
B000051Y0G|5.0|This is THE pop album of early/mid 80's. This launched an unknown woman by the name of Cyndi Lauper into superstardom back in 1984 *the year that she actually rivaled the popularity of Madonna.* It is 6x platinum to date and is a must-have. Of course you have the 80's pop anthem &quot;Girls Just Wanna Have Fun&quot; which was a #2 US hit and is probably Cyndi's signature song. It's still a great listen after all these years. &quot;Time After Time&quot; was a #1 hit and is still played quite a lot on adult contemporary radio. &quot;She Bop&quot; was a also a top 5 hit and was actually contreversial due to its actual meaning...It's still a great song, though. I love the other top 10 hit present on here which is &quot;All Through the Night.&quot; It isn't remembered as much as the other singles on here, but Cyndi sounds great on it and I love the chorus. The 5th single is &quot;Money Changes Everything&quot; and is another fantastic song and was a US top 40 hit. The non-singles are not as outstanding as the hits on &quot;She's So Unusual&quot; but they're definitely worth a listen. You have a Prince cover and even a 1920's cover with &quot;He's So Unusual&quot; which leads right into the catchy pop ditty &quot;Yeah Yeah.&quot; <br />Although Cyndi Lauper would continue to have minor to moderate success through-out the rest of the 80's, she never again matched the success of &quot;She's So Unusual.&quot; It's a classic pop album and Cyndi should be very proud of it.
0385486804|4.0|Chris McCandless's life taught us two things: there is only you standing between you and your dreams and ideals, and you are going to die probably when you are not ready. Aren't these two thoughts upsetting to you? I didn't know anything about his life. If I knew of his life few years ago, I ridiculed him and criticized him. What a stupid idea to give up everything you had and take off to Alaska and try to live off the land! How arrogant! I would be hard on him, because I was unhappy with my life. I dreamed of stepping out of it for at least few months but I didn't really even had time to organize my vacation. Then the layoff. I have a (new) job and trapped in a modern society still. But I no longer have urge to put him down. Yes, he was stupid and didn't need to die. But he was brutally true to himself and his ideals. He had courage to find out what it was like to live in his dream. What am I doing with my life? What are you doing with yours? How much time do we have left? These are hard questions to ask. I can believe his life is upsetting to many who haven't really had hard look at their lives for a while. (Or to many people who don't really like the idea that they could be killed so easily or lose everything overnight.)
B00006LSM3|4.0|I am a huge fan of Jeff Lynne's work with ELO, owing all ELO records, box sets, solo albums etc and I love them all.  This is a pretty good album with familiar production touches courtesy of Jeff. My personal favorites are Pieces Fish, Rising Sun and Devil and the Deep Blue Sea I don't think there's a song I don't like. I agree with Jeff that this album has a very spiritual feel to it.
B00005QIPH|5.0|i love every single song on this cd.  the strokes are great, you should see them live, it's a great show!
B000068TPN|5.0|It was gory. It was hard to watch, but I got very involved with the wives left behind -- been there, done that.  <br />Eye opening, and made the divorce statistics for men who served in the wars from WWII on easy to understand -- the amazing part is that any of them stayed together.<br />With the international complexities today, I think this movie and others like it are important -- and every politician should watch them.
B000002UAX|5.0|The Best of the Best from the Best...
B00006CXXU|5.0|I am very picky about my music and there are very few cd's that I can listen from beginning to end without loosing my mind. This is one of those rare few. First off, let me just say that I think the lyrics are very good, as oppsed to stuff like \\"i love you baby, girl i need you, etc.....\\". I think it's great that Christina can break the pop princess mold and come into her own like she does here, especially with songs like \\"Walk Away\\", the smokey, sit-on-a-piano jazz ballad, \\"Make Over\\", th pshychedelic rock tune, and \\"Keep On Singin' My Song\\", which reminds me of songs from the mid 90's by artists like Des'ree.<br />As for her new image: bravo! She has never looked better than she does now. It's nice to see her take pop into another direction. The pictures in her album are far from \\"porn\\", I think. They look very classy, very artistic, and don't show any part of her body that would be concidered pornographic. They show that she isn't ashamed, and that the human body is a beautiful thing. (As also conveyed in the song \\"Beautiful\\".) <br />The sound on this new album is.....fantastic! I popped this into my cd player expecting a mix of something Britney/N*Sync/Backstreet-ish, but I was pleasantly surprised. For once, an album from a pop singer actually sounds original and not written, recorded and produced in a week. While one of her songs does sound Mariah-ish, lets be honest: even Mariah Carey copies Mariah Carey songs. Almost all of her singles sound intentionally identical, including her new material. It's good that Christina can demonstrate her musical diversity and ability. <br />...
B00006CXSS|5.0|It's the best!!! I saw it on HBO, and I just have to say is that this 6-DVD Box Set worth every penny of your money...If you like this type of stories BUY IT!!! BUY IT NOW!!!<br /><APQ>
0790736039|4.0|Of course the book is better, I mean, what movie have you seen where the book is worse? It's not as good as Halloween or the Exorcist, but it's still a good movie to watch when it's dark out. Annette O' Toole was very good and so was John Ritter. My favorite actor in this movie, though, was Tim Curry. I never imagined Mr. Curry playing an evil clown who eats children, but he plays it very well. Rent this movie, some seens will creep you out.
0066214122|5.0|Michael Chrichton is the best author ever, hands down, flat out.
6304308388|5.0|An immortal movie.  Some people watch A Christmas Carol every year.  For me, The Apartment is an annual rite of the Christmas Season.  It is a perfectly realized film on a theme that is devilishly difficult to carry off.  Jack Lemmon has done the impossible -- giving a lonely, bored and unhappy character energy, charm and humor.  A virtuoso performance.  He draws us into the most mundane of activities (straining pasta, drinking at a bar, talking to a fellow apartment dweller).  Then he gives us a life lesson in the difference between right and wrong.  In his great films, Wilder is pure genius (The Apartment, Some Like It Hot, Stalag 17).  He knows what he's after and he gets it, and we watch in wonder.  Thank you, Shirley McClain, Fred MacMurray, Edie Adams, Ray Walston and the rest.  Well done!
B00005JKZT|5.0|The Two Towers begins with an amazing fight scene, which, not to give too much away, involves two enemies battling in free fall! Wow! After that eye-popping experience, the movie just gets better. In terms of energy and excitement, this is the best one yet. I can't wait to see it again, and I can't wait for December 2003!!
B000021YQV|5.0|Those two words sum up this cd perfectly. All of the songs have insane lyrics attached to them with some incredibly heavy hard-hitting music, though sometimes mellower parts do come through. I just got it yesterday and I already love it. It has great rock out moments that are some of the best heavy metal riffs I've ever heard, but then it also has many songs that could be qualified as \\"pretty\\". Of course the singles are great, but all the songs are equally great as well. This is just a refreshingly awesome cd that everyone should buy, and definitely stands out from the rest of the muck being released nowadays. This has even got me interested in buying their other 2 albums as well, their self-titled one from 98 and their new Steal This Album released a few weeks ago. Since Toxicity is so great I can only imagine how good those two will be also if I end up getting them. But in the meanwhile I will definitely be playing this one to death for sure. Thanks System for a memorable cd and here's hoping you never change your ways.
0380002930|5.0|I put it plain and simple, this was a great book.<BR>  I don't want to make it look like I can't respect other people's opinions, but please. People put down \\"This book sucks!\\" and that's all. Give a reason.<BR>  Here, I'll give you a reason it was good. Unlike other authors, Richard Adams actually studied about the animals in the book. You could believe what was happening in the book. I'm glad I had to read it for English.
0316666343|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read of late. If you have ever lost anyone close to you, this bittersweet story can help you through the greiving process with a gentle nudge. I am grateful for having read this story.
0060900075|5.0|This book is truly a classic.  It has a timeless quality and youth-like enthusiasm.  Mr. Huxley does such a superb job at capturing the &quot;feel&quot; of the whole experience.  He weaves wonderful prose with intriguing ideas.  Not being an avid art aficionado, I was left a bit daunted with the numerous art references, but overall he has left me with a newfound interest in art.  <br />Huxley touches on some good questions concerning psychoactive substances (and general &quot;chemical vacations&quot;) and perception.  I am intrigued with his idea of the brain acting as a sort of &quot;reducing valve&quot; for the whole of what could be perceived (experiencing &quot;mind at large&quot;).  It is surely a quick read, but still packed full of philosophy, little tidbits, history and a myriad of other such though provoking ideas.  <br />A great quote:  &quot;The need for frequent chemical vacations from intolerable selfhood and repulsive surroundings will undoubtedly remain.&quot;  And Huxley does a wonderful job at explaining why this is so.  This is a must read for anyone trying to understand the whole why and what for of hallucinogens, or for the aspiring philosopher, the general curious about life, mystery, etc.  It is a necessary read.
B000003TAW|5.0|Weezer is by far my favorite band, and this is a must have CD for ANYone, and I do mean anyone. The CD is absolutly amazing; there's just nothing like it. Some people may argue that their 10 songs, not even reaching 40 minutes in length, is too short, but it's enough, leaving you wanting more: buy their other CD's. Each song is different, and each is just as amazing as all the rest. There's not a song I don't love on this CD. BUY THIS CD!!!
B000050XEI|5.0|If only I could draw...  I would draw a computer table, all covered with papers, textbooks, food remains, and a geek in glasses, tired and sleepy, bending over the keyboard, looking with his myopic eyes at the screen full of brackets, backslashes and punctuation marks.  His clothes are wrinkled, his body is unattractive, no girl ever kissed him, his parents are far away, the deadlines are pressing, and brain is overwhelmed with minute details of the work.  However, the geek smiles warmly and happily, tears of joy and kindness glistening in the artificial light.  For, behind him, stays a beautiful female goddess, the goddess of love, peace and harmony, worshipped by Elves, Dwarves and Men.  She sings him the songs of Rivendell and Lothlorien, gently stroking his uncombed hair, and he knows that She understands him deeply, cares about him, and will help him.  Every day he opens his little shrine, takes a small plastic rectangle with Her image, prayerfully looks at it and whispers Her name.  Your Name, Enya.
B00006LLLN|5.0|If so, this is your lucky day. Check them one more time in case of an accidental miscount, but once you're quite sure you have a weird-looking flap on either side of your head, go and buy this glorious piece of beauty, because no other qualification is necessary.<br />I'm not a music buff, but I'd like to say thank-you to all the knowledgeable amazon listeners on this page for writing so compellingly and well about this wonderful discovery I've made - I had never heard a note of Alison Krauss and her band of magicians, and bought it purely on the strength of what I read here. Some such clutches in the dark have been disastrous, but not this time...<br />Seldom in my life have I come across such a thrilling display of people doing something well, and of other people enjoying being near them while it happens. Dismiss as absurd the contrary voices who complain about the crowd noise, because it does nothing but add to the sense of high occasion. When you buy a live recording, you're going to hear people clap. It's not rocket science, so get used to it. Instead of fussing about the occasional hoot, feast yourself on the music, with all its variety and energy and sheer heart-stopping delight. Either that, or save your money up and buy yourself some ears.
B000021XS0|5.0|Jerry McCulley should'nt be writing about progressive metal, 'cause he absolutely doesn't know anything about first class metal. Dream Theater are geniuses, every single one of the band members, no question about it. Jerry McCulley, write about Blue or some other lousy money-band instead !<BR>Dream Theater rules !!
B00007BH5C|4.0|Hey, it's hard to top what Howard Shore accomplished with the score to the first Lord of the Rings feature, \\"The Fellowship of the Ring.\\" Not only was the score used to maximum potential in the film, but it is quite an enjoyable listening experience all on its own. Sadly, the score to \\"Two Towers\\" does not come close to the magic Shore accomplished in the first film. As a professional musician myself, I know how tough it is to keep writing great music. I felt (after seeing the film and hearing the CD) that Shore simply did not make the best use of the themes he created for the first film (there are only a few times in the new score where we hear anything of the three main themes from the first film), then failed to adequately build upon the main theme he wrote for this film. There were many scenes where I felt the music simply did not help the action. Considering  how important the battle sequences are in \\"Two Towers\\" Shore  (along with the director, I'm sure) fail to give us the \\"one-two punch\\" of music that supports the visuals. There's no way I could ever say the music is bad -- truth is it is excellent, but fails to deliver the emotional charge that I felt the music  delivered in \\"Fellowship.\\" There are several moments of tremendous heroism in the new film, but without the music to support these scenes, they fall a bit short. Finally, \\"Gollum's Song\\" pales in comparison to Enya's haunting \\"May it be\\" of the first film (which should have walked away with the Oscar for best song). Yes, the lyrics are poignant, but the music is lethargic, if not downright depressing. Is this the way to leave the audience? I had so hoped for more out of a composer that really outdid himself in the first film. Hey Howard, there's no shame in reusing themes from previous works, particularly when they are so good. The Baroque composers (Vivaldi, in particular) stole themes from themselves over and over. In a nutshell, the music was like the movie: Good, but not up to the level we cameto expect after \\"Fellowship.\\" Worth owning, but you won't find yourself playing it again and again (as I did with the \\"Fellowhip\\" soundtrack).
B00005JLRR|4.0|Trekkies and Trekkers will love this movie no mater what. The movie veers off from the typical look of Star Trek movies a little, the use of color to suggest moods reminds me of Star Trek II a little, and the plot is very similiar in other areas as well. Fans of Worf may be disapointed as he gets little to do in the movie, as does Doctor Crusher. The CGI looks great, but doesn't take center stage, like in the recent Star Wars movies. (That's a good thing.) While it doesn't seem to be quite as good as First Contact, it's still a very respectable outing (maybe the last?) for the Next Generation crew.
B00000K19E|5.0|Ok so this movie has a lot of mind blowing and for some people meaningless action.  A lot of people loved the movie for the action.  Whether on purpose or accident Dark City was the father of The Matrix and the many other reality questioning movies that will come in the future.  But let's get real here once Keanu Reeves character is made aware of what's really happening the remainder of the story could be depicted by Neo (a hacker legend) sitting at a terminal trying to break into the  mainframe.  The battles and interaction with the Smiths are either the fire wall,the operating system, or the mainframe itself but we should all get the point - the action is a symbol for what is really happening the manipulation of ones and zeros.   Hacking is not visibly exciting hense we have the 1st of the Trilogy in all it's active glory.  If you enjoyed the Philosophical and social questions it raised, fantastic your a thinker!  If you enjoyed the innovations and the action, excellent!    But don't tell me this movie was simple and lacks originality unless maybe your favorite activities involve things like riding a Barrel over Niagra, or Sky-diving nude over a volcano.

B00005B364|5.0|This is a fantastic album; a true classic! A majority of the tracks on this CD are instrumentals, with the exceptions of \\"Hocus Pocus\\", featuring Thijs Van Leer's manic yodelling, and the title track \\"Moving Waves\\", in which the \\"lyrics\\" are more or less a Nostradamus-like reading, or a \\"quatrain\\" set to music.<br />As some have pointed out, \\"Hocus Pocus\\" is basically the bizarre curio on this album, as the 2nd track \\"Le Clochard (Bread)\\" with it's gentle, lilting classical guitar phrasings and Mellotron backing are indeed in sharp contrast to \\"Hocus Pocus\\". \\"Focus II\\" is a wonderful instrumental track, which sets the tone for the lengthy \\"Eruption\\", containing a \\"suite\\" of individual songs; most notably \\"Tommy\\" and \\"The Bridge\\", both of which amply display the screaming guitar pyrotechnics of Jan Akkerman.<br />In my opinion, this is one of the greatest progressive rock albums ever recorded!
B00006RU5B|4.0|Audioslaves debut album was one of the years most anticipated albums. It was brought with much hype from both Soundgarden and RATM fans alike. But to much avail, the music is lacking and no real star songs stand out. <BR>        <BR>This album really reminds me of Slipknots Iowa. Because there are no real hit tracks like their previous effort. Cochise may act like a single, but its nowhere near as powerful as songs like Killing in the Name or even as grandiose as Black Hole Sun. Instead, we get a bunch of songs that are nice but not really spectacular. <BR>        <BR>The best part of the album would have to be Chris Cornells vocal work. Tom Morellos work is good but many of his solos are out of place and cliche, as are much of his riffs. Thats because weve already heard these same solos and weird sounds before. Morello used to be known as an innovator of guitar work, but I was disappointed. This album doesnt expand any kind of guitar work that we havent really already heard from RATM. <BR>        <BR>Overall, the sound is of Audioslave is still in infancy. Well have to wait and see what happens in the future for this supergroup. Still, this is a must buy for any fan of Soundgarden, RATM, or even any hard rock fan. Even though this wasnt a breakthrough album it still gives listeners a very good cd to listen to for the thirteen or so bones they spent. Well worth the money if not worth the five stars
B00005B36H|4.0|Honestly, i can not decifer if this is tool's best work or not, it is a good album. It is no house of holy or wish you were here. THis is a band very different from any band in history, with them shrouded in mystery and occult mythology, tool brings about the same aroua that a Zeppelin might have in the past. If you should buy this album is not for me to say, even though i consider myself a music officianado, who i to tell you this is a good album. I am writing this review on behalf of the tool live show, an expierence all in its own, they are done touring for now and persumabley for a while(four years or so) but if you get the opputunity, please go see it, changed my life, the stage show is comprobale to that of floyd's.
B000063DIH|3.0|If you've grown up on staple Iron Maiden fare like I have, you'll find this album not upto the mark. Its disappointing that Maiden couldn't get into the groove even after one album of experimentation(No prayer for the dying). The first thing they should've done is fire Janick Gers and  bring back Adrian Smith. This is not because Janick's a bad guitarist, he's excellent and probably a lot more technically skilled than Murray and Smith. Its more that his style is suited to single lead guitar bands, where he takes center-stage. A twin lead attack demands precision, an almost telepathic understanding of each other's styles and compromise in some cases. Gers and Murray could never match the fluidity of Smith - Murray. <br />Now that I've gotten that off my chest, I think this aint a bad album at all. It opens with the rip roaring Be Quick or Be dead, which has Dickenson screaming through his pipes at full blast. Gers and Murray combine well and come out with blistering leads when the time comes. The other songs going forward are a downward spiral with occasional bright spots(Childhood's end, Chains of misery). 'Afraid to shoot strangers' is a good track, and definitely a track a non-maiden band wouldve considered a radio hit in any album. 'Weekend Warrior' is a good number too, about football hooliganism and so is the title track. Sounds a lot better live. <BR>BUT...this is Maiden folks, and the reason we keep listening to them is because they're unlike any other band we know. <BR>This would be a great album by an above average, even high class metal band...<BR>Gen Xers may say...\\"kick out those long haired low brow guitar god wannabes, bring in something new...\\" but there's a difference between well thought out change and change for its own sake. <BR>The other songs sound a lot like No Prayer for the dying. <BR>Overall a 3 star rating.
B00006RU5B|4.0|Grunge aficionados, waiting for the heavy dirge of the early 90s, can't possibly wait for a better heard, more promising CD in 2002, and into 2003.  Soundgarden left us for all practical purposes, RATM never had much to offer, but they spoke from the heart in ways that many bands of today (and yor) can't comprehend or relate to.  &quot;Cochise&quot;, the leadoff single, is a little stagnant, reminiscent of &quot;the Garden's&quot; blastoff approach and takeoff guitars that splurge all over speakers and into radio homes.  The following single is softer, mid-tempo and quite elegant, not unlike Chris C's solo disc of a few years back.<br />With the Seattle scene well behind us, Audioslave don't hesitate to mold their sound and words into a cohesive and loving bond that translates to music we all understand and never see enough of, except when we close our eyes and dream for what's out there. Wailing guitars don't tell a third of the story, as Cornell's vengeance seeks restitution to those left behind, and the hammering drums keep everybody anonymous.  Production-wise, a mixing of the two bands presents a recourse in our abilities to differentiate the various styles we encroach in our existence - and in the existence to those that know us.  Live it and believe it, 'cause it's here for sure.  One technique is to listen to the 'Garden with half an ear, saving the rest for what you deem necessary - if indeed you feel that approach.  If not, believe in what you hear, if only for the moment you want to.  I'd say this ranks with the top albums of 2002.
0446310786|4.0|The book I reviewed was called To Kill A Mockingbird.  It's this story about family living in The south.  Maycomb, Alabama to be exact.  The story is told from the view of  Scout Finch a little girl.  The story is about the trials and tribulations of Scout and her brother Jem anlong with their father Atticus.   Their father is a lawyer and takes on a case of a black man accused of raping a white girl.  This stirs a lot of emotions from the other people living in Maycomb, mostly bad.  Everyone is against Atticus.  Overall the book is a classic.  It deals with problems of the past as well as problems of the future.  That is one reason some many people have read it.  The book does a good job of using dialogue and characterization.  You feel like you know all of the characters on a personal level.  One thing that makes it difficult to read is the fact that the author, Lee Harper, uses the southern dialect.  Some of the words she uses are slang's that people from the south would use.  While reading the book you are reminded how bad those times were for black people.  The book does a good job of showing the southern way of life at that time.  the book starts out slow but ends up picking up making for an interesting read.  I would recommend it but warn you about the slow start.  If you can get past that I think you can enjoy it.
B00006LSM3|3.0|The reviewers on this site have gone way overboard with the rating of this recording. If I could give it 3 1/2 I would, but perhaps the 3 can offset some of the 5 ratings.<br />That being said, this is a good outing from Harrison. There's no power pop masterpiece here like \\"What is Life\\" or \\"Wah-Wah\\", in fact I don't think there are any hits at all here. But the songs here are all good. The playing is great. Like a previous reviewer has commented, I don't think Harrison's voice has ever sounded this powerful.<br />I also don't have a problem with the production like alot of reviewers have commented on. To me it's about right.<br />Harrison has always suffered moreso than the other Beatles. Not only does he get compared to the Beatles, but he also gets compared to his first album, All Things Must Pass, which we now know for sure he will never again equal or even come close. He made such a grand statement right out of the gate that there wasn't much place to go but downhill from there.<br />Even on this recording he still doesn't make the grand lyrical statements that were made on ATMP. Still, this is a solid recording. I've heard it for 3 days now. It's all high caliber playing. There are alot of little vocal harmonies George does with himself that you don't notice at first. It's part of his \\"signature\\" sound I guess. Also, his slide playing is great as always. About half the songs feature a ukelele, which sort of makes it unique also.<br />He seems to have a good sense of humor on this recording. Lots of his vocal work seems to lightheartedly recall recent Dylan stylings, which Harrison can pull off whereas some newcomer would get accused of imitation or blasphemy. <br />Harrison's son Dhanni and Jeff Lynne are the main support musicians on this album, although some other guests come and go along the way. It's hard to tell what Jeff Lynne and Dhanni are doing. Most of the time it's some keyboard and guitar, but all of the slide work and probably most of the other guitar is George. <br />Don't let my review turn you off. I like this record. Just be aware that time has a way of letting us know what's truly great, and alot of these people giving this record a 5 are just caught up in the moment. This is a really good record. It surprised me. There are no bummer tracks on it. I tend to like the latter half of this record better than the first half. The last time I heard it I started with the instrumental  all the way to the end.<br />The song, \\"Never Get Over You\\" is really good. It's sort of simple and the tempo is slow, but it has some really cool augmented chord flourishes that almost provide the beat for the song. I also like the song \\"Brainwashed\\" more than most people seem to. Actually, I like the whole thing in essence; I just don't think it's the greatest album in the history of rock or even the greatest album Harrison recorded.<br />That being said, I like this record alot more than \\"Cloud Nine\\", and alot more than anything going back to \\"33 & 1/3\\" or even \\"Living in the Material World.\\" Some stuff between \\"Living in the Material World\\" and this album really made me cringe, but this record never does.<br />I Hope this review helps you. R.I.P George.
B00000099Y|5.0|this album is one of the best things to ever happen in music.  Anyone who thinks otherwise doenst know what there talking about.<BR>this is a review to make this cd go back up to 5 stars where it belongs.
B0000024SI|5.0|Everyone says \\"Blonde on Blonde\\" is Dylan's best, but for my money this album is Bobby's greatest. The whole affair is a dark, cynical trip through the urban underbelly, with Dylan's incredibly complicate, and possibly non-sensical, prose-like lyrics acting as your guide. Each song slides off the other in a perfect succession, each one adding another layer to the other. This is different from \\"Blonde\\", where each song workes in a call-and-response mode. \\"Highway\\" has each of its tunes adding on the previous one, all of them culminating in the breathtaking climax which is \\"Desolation Row\\". I think this might be the most satisfying of Dylan's records, because of this special addition mode of record. From the tone of this album came albums like \\"OK Computer\\" and \\"Automatic for the People\\"-albums that aren't just a grouping of songs but a careful selection of well-written tracks where each one adds something more to the one that came before it. Dylan's lyrics are poetry, I think we all know that by now, and \\"Highway\\" is the Dylan album that gives the listener the most poetic phrases and the most interesting and exciting mental images. From this album we get \\"Dr. Filth/he keeps his world/inside of a leather cup\\" and \\"Tuba players now rehearse around the flag pole\\" (and those are just the ones I can remember off the top of my head). Let's take a look at the songs. It has his most famous (and possibly greatest) song, \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" as its first song, kickstarting the album like a gunshot. It continues with the excellent \\"Tombstone Blues\\" an extremely stream-of-consciensceness rant that might be about corruption in high places of leadership (that's my interpretation). The delicious and rambling \\"It Takes a Lot to Laugh, It Takes a Train to Cry\\" follows, then the delirious \\"From a Buick 6\\" (which contains the great line \\"She's got a steam-shovel mama to/keep away the dead\\"). The fifth song, the slow dirge \\"Ballad of a Thin Man\\", is my dad's favorite Bob Dylan song. And I can see why, it's a powerful and cynical look at a philistine, a passive onlooker named Mister Jones. \\"Queen Jane Approximately\\" is a lovely mid-tempo number that has one of Dylan's best melodies and continues his love affair with adverbs in his titles for no apparent reason. The title track is full of energy and allusions, its whip-crack lyrics providing images for the mind while the omnipresent whistle blow propels you on a musical train track to your doom. This is a great one live. The line \\"When you're lost in the rain in Juarez and it's Easter time too\\" starts off \\"Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues\\", a song that is in Dylan's top 15 simply for the regret-filled whine that Dylan employs while singing \\"She'll take you in and leave you howling at the moon\\". \\"Desolation Row\\", wow, yeah. When I first heard this 11-minute epic I decided right then and there that Dylan is the best songwriter who ever lived.  Seemingly a poem of doom and sadness, as the song goes through you ask yourself \\"is Desolation Row a bad place?\\" Dylan seems to change his stance throughout this song, at first making the destination seem hellish, then he seems to be telling us it is the only salvation left for a band of desperate characters including Casanova, the aforementioned Dr. Filth and his nurse, the Good Samaritan, Queen Ophelia, Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot, me, you, and Dylan himself. What is he saying to us? What is Desolation Row? At the final perfect harmonica chord, we as listeners are not sure of anything. Anything, that is, except that we have just heard one of the greatest albums in history.
0066214122|5.0|I have read all of Michael Crichton's books due, mainly, to his focus on the technical background to back up his far reaching fantasy plots.  This book has, by far, the most tecnical yet understandable descriptions yet. <br />His references to principles of both biology and advanced computer science give this book a credibility not often found in science fiction novels.   Specifically his descriptions of the use of bacteria as the basis of the nano-mechanism villians of the novel was extremely detailed, yet easy to understand.   <br />This book outpaces some of his earlier work in its ability to keep the story exciting and moving along at a pace that keeps the reader from being able to put it down. <br />As a fan of his novels, I believe this book is vintage Crichton and a must read for any science fiction fan.
B00005JKGI|5.0|OK.<BR> What brilliant marketing strategist is responsible for holding up this DVD release?  Since I haven't had the opportunity to see the North American DVD, my 5 star rating is intended exclusively for the Region 2 Phase Alternate Line (PAL) British Widescreen DVD that's for sale, now, at another AMAZON across the Atlantic. <BR> Quite a few of us can now easily cope with both Region 2 and PAL, and if this kind of marketing ploy endures, a lot more of us will be driven to do so, very soon.

0553812173|3.0|Although I have already written a review of this book, I can't help that after reading this book for a second time, I believe that I did not adequately review it correctly in the first place. I had, at first read, given Gardens only 2 stars, but after I see what other books I have reviewed with 2 stars, I cannot help but see that Gardens is of a higher caliber. Let me try this all again. I stand by my old review in that this book has its flaws, but it is clear to me now that Gardens is probably one of the better fantasy books of the year.<br />For a debut novel, Gardens is great. And although I cannot praise this story as top of the line, I cannot ignore the fact that I have come back to read this book many times. It is Erikson' supreme writing style that has brought me back over and over again. Everytime I begin reading the pages just fly by. Unlike some books, where you notice every turn of the page, Erikson' writing allows you to go for 20-30 pages in minutes without even noticing the time passing. Erikson paints his scenes so vividly, and accompanies them with such interesting and realistic dialogue that it just flows like magic. <br />Unlike many fantasy novels that often begin slowly and unfold gradually, Gardens blasts forward with hurtling speed and doesn't let up. From the beginning to end, Gardens flies in fast-forward and while exciting, it many times shoots past details and information that, as the reader, you begin to feel lost without. Many things are just skimmed over and never fully explained, so various character motivations and explanation remain undiscovered. The world-building seems to be the beginning of something vast in scope, and yet is only touched upon in relation to the fast-moving plot. The lack of cohesiveness births more questions often times than overall satisfaction. Nevertheless, you are many times enthralled with the plot and don't become disenchanted until the end of the story. <br />Also, to the books credit, it moves away from somany stereotypical aspects of the fantasy genre. There are no young peasant boys discovering a royal heritage and magic power hidden within, no quests to find a long lost items of power, no old mysterious men with their quiet strongmen companions, and no worlds where everyone is always beautiful, intelligent, and virtuous. Gardens of the Moon's uniqueness is its strength. Its centering on the harshness and cynicism of war and the complex spiderwebs of political machinations make it all too more fascinating. It's a world where the main goal is to stay alive, and no one is safe, not even the main characters, from death or worse. <br />And it is these main characters which are another selling point for Gardens. They are not all likeable people, but you sympathize with almost all of them, and find you rooting for them even in the worst of times. However, as I have speculated in my past review, Erikson faults by having an overabundance of POV characters. Like Robert Jordan, who plagued his later books in the Wheel of Time with so many POV characters that you never really saw the true cast anymore, Erikson spreads his POVs out to thinly, so most of the characters cannot be drawn out as well as could be, since you are constantly shifting back and forth among them, especially towards the close of the book. <br />Gardens of the Moon is a very good novel. And though it has its inadequacies, it is definetly a must read book. For not only is it a cut up from most of the genre, but Erikson's next two books in the series are absolutely wonderful, and fix everything that was wrong in Gardens. I believe Erikson is one of the best voices in fantasy today, up there with the likes of Jordan, Martin, and Kay.
B00005JKDR|5.0|One of Disney and PIXAR's best. It gives real depth to all the characters. Above and beyond. They all seem so real. I laughed and I cried. You will really fall in love with this movie. I have seen it four times now. I can't wait to see it again. The kids in school just loved it. The images and voices really made it work.
0871137380|5.0|This is an incredible depiction of an event that very few people know about, or care(d) to know about.  A Holywood movie was made out of it, but that was more of an action movie... it didn't delve into the trenches of the politics.<br />Bowden explains everything.  As other reviewers have said, it reads like fiction.  And that's oh so true.  However, it doesn't read like bland fiction, more like detailed fiction where whenever they talk about a new proper noun (be it a person, gun, or city) they go deeply into it.  Some people don't like that, and couldn't care less for it; they would rather read the action.  But this isn't the right type of book for those people.  If you can accept slightly-slowed-down-at-times fiction, that's real, then you'll love this.<br />This goes into great detail... basically, I would reccommend it.  I saw the movie first, and I assure you it's better than the movie.  I am a Rambo-Terminator-Matrix action kinda guy, and didn't believe that an action movie could be accurately described in a book - boy was I wrong.  It makes you, the reader, feel right there -as though you are a Ranger, or a Delta... as though you are Gary Gorden, or Mike Durant.<br />However, in many ways, it shows the movie industrie's inability to keep things straight... for example:<br />-When the chopper goes down, Durant uses an MP5-K.  In the movie, however, he is depicted with an MP5-A2;.<br />-Most of the M60 guns were M249s...<br />-The movie completely ignored the fact that we had LAWs.<br />-The movie had the convoy consist of about 10 vechiles and last maybe 100 meters.  In real life (book), it was 200 vechiles, and it lasted 2 miles. <br />SO, if you read it before the movie, you'll just be annoyed (look at me ;))<br />I honestly recommend reading after seeing movie... might seem odd, but is IMO better.<br />First review... hope it helped your decision.
B00005JKZT|4.0|Having recently viewed the Director's Cut of the Fellowship of the Ring (containing 30 minutes of added footage and an absorbing documentary on Tolkien's worlds and the making of the film), I was oiled and primed for the Two Towers. I was not dissappointed. Perhaps what stands out, most surprisingly, is the depth of character development - even among newly introduced players, such as Theoden, his daughter Eowyn, Grima Wormtongue, Faramir and, especially, Smeagol \\"Gollum\\".  Pathos and bravery (with considerable comic relief courtesy of Gimli and Gollum) make for a potent, compelling motion picture experience.<br />How can one resist the nobility of grim warriors determined to fight bravely despite the certitude of defeat and death?<br />The battle scene at Helms Deep is the greatest scene of medieval warfare ever hung onto the big screen. Panoramic, close-up and set-piece battle scenes blend together seemlessly. The sword and archery combat is intense and desperate. The only thing missing was boiling oil spilling from the ramparts (but I suppose that would have been too gruesome - and not in keeping with the book -even for this violent film).<br />Not that fealty to the book was uppermost in the minds of the creators of this film.  Certain improbabilities, plot holes, and deviations from Tolkien do strain credulity.  And REALLY, was it necessary to alter Faramir's character from the books (making him a brutish jerk), add the pointless scene at Osgiliath (fabricated from whole cloth), and shove in the extra orc/warg battle scene as a prelude to Helm's Deep (with Aragorn almost dying but somehow being supernaturally saved by the Elf babe, Arwen)?  Tolkien had nothing to do with any of these scenes and, really, for the most part they do seem a bit pointless.<br />The above quibblings aside (and Tolkien purists, please take note: these are MINOR quibbles), TTT is THE motion picture to see at the theatre this year. Enjoy, enjoy, enjoy!<br />A final note to the more disgruntled reviewers in this space:  remember Bakshi's decrepit attempt, and count your blessings.  In your wildest dreams you could never have hoped for anything even as remotely satisfying as Mr. Jackson & Company's rendering of LOTR thus far.ntled reviewers in this space:  remember Bakshi's decrepit attempt, and count your blessings.

B00006G8LB|2.0|Tobey Maguire makes an incredibly cheesy Spiderman. The special effects aren't that bad, but I've seen much better. There's nothing really new about this superhero flick, just the same old good-vs.-bad junk.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|I purchased their english single c-d \\"all the things she said\\" because of its catchy beat. (I learned more about them and found out of all the controversy about the possibility of them being lesbians. personally that did not so much effect my purchase. that is the entertainment business for you! Let them do whatever!)And then i recieved \\"200 km/h in the wrong lane\\" for my birthday this month. i had heard their russian songs and although i am english, i prefer their russian songs more. but anyways, i love it. they has awesome views, beats, and their voices are so rythmic together. anyone who passes this c-d by is crazy!<BR>there are 2 full russian tracks ( Ya shosla uma and Nas ne dagoniat) and an english track with russian rap in it (Stars).For anyone who doesnt know russian, the words are still easy to compare to english, but slightly altered from their english versions. I think trevor horn and ivan shapovalov (producers) certainly know how to attract an audience in many different ways and views. i enjoy their beat and this is not some pop girl band. i can certainly compare this to some type of techno type beats and alternative. personally i think this is a great buy. i give this album props. but if you enjoy it, check out their russian albums as well. this duo knows how to sing.<BR>it also comes with footage (behind the scenes part 2 and their<BR>catchy and beautifully filmed video \\"all the things she said\\") but if you want to see the 1st behind the scenes footage, i suggest purchasing their \\"all the things she said\\" c-d single. well worth it. i think the album is underpriced !! this is a steal for music this good!!! bottom line: awesome music with awesome girls! (yulia and lena) oh and yulia will be 18 in february, so they are not little girls !!! (send her a card)<BR>peace out and get this! Enjoy !!!!
B00003CXE7|5.0|\\"Gladiator\\" is a film about one man's fight to rekindle the flame of a great idea on the verge of being completely extinguished.<BR>The great idea was Rome - one of Man's supreme efforts to realize the Ideal which mankind has ever striven to attain.<BR>But this ideal is lost under the rubble of political corruption, injustice and immorality.<br />A man of courage and honor - General Maximus makes a promise to a dying Emperor, Marcus Aurelius that he shall salvage this great idea before it is lost forever, lost irrevocably to mankind.<BR>But before anything can be done, Maximus becomes a terrible victim of the socio-political system by which he has hitherto remained untouched, and at whose summit we behold a moral monster - Commodus - the son of Marcus Aurelius.<BR>From the position of a renowned military leader, this system pulls him down to its dregs - Maximus becomes a slave and a gladiator.<br />Can a mere gladiator - who faces the prospect of a violent death every moment of his life - rise against the mighty Roman power and rescue mankind's greatest and grandest dream from remaining a dream forever?<br />This is what \\"Gladiator\\", a magnificent, dramatic and compelling epic is all about.<br />\\"Gladiator\\" is unabashedly concerned with the projection of a positive hero whose stature remains undiluted to the very end.<BR>The performance by every character in the film, particularly Russell Crowe, is wonderful.<br />A film replete with thrilling action, blood and gore, violence and suspense, \\"Gladiator\\" is not just an action-for-the-sake-of-action film.<BR>It has profoundly and undeniably important philosophical-metaphysical implications.<br />This combination of a historic perspective with a definite political viewpoint; a metaphysical dimension with a grand sense of life; a truthful presentation of the eternal laws of human existence with the projection of moral values - integrated to a nail-biting,terrific and terrifying story - this superb combination makes \\"Gladiator\\" one of the best films of the recent times.
B00005JKED|1.0|It has every cliched \\"gang\\",\\"bad cop\\",\\"LA\\",\\"Rookie caught between his partner and whats right\\"  scene going. One of the worst films Ive ever seen - on a par with trashy alian/monster B movies from the 1970s. Why Denzel was nominated & got an Oscar for this is a mystery. <BR>Why Amazon recomended it for my wish list is another!!!! <BR>I gave it one star because LA has some good restaurants....
006016848X|1.0|The quantity of positive reviews for this claptrap simply astonishes me.  I read this book due to the vast quantity of bad press it generated.  I had to vomit after every chapter. He insults both male and female with equal aplomb. <BR>On a technical level, the book is poorly written and monotonous.  Any analogy can be overused, which is why rhetoric coaches and writing guides attempt to stress the conservative use of an analogy.  Gray obviously missed this idea in his education (that is assuming the Science of Creative Intelligence from the Maharishi European Research University or his mail-order Ph.D. program even teach you how to write).  The man is poorly educated, he has no credentials, and not even a whit of academic respectability to back him up.  Now, none of these things necessitate a poor writer, but when mixed with the fact that the man is an absolute idiot and a raving misogynist, the book must, by necessity, ..... <BR>Content-wise, this is nothing but a backlash fueled attempt to re-establish the paradigms of male domination and female submission that centuries of western, mainly religious, dogma has forced down our throats.  The truth is that as soon as a child exits the womb, they are treated according to predetermined gender roles.  That earliest treatment, when a child is most impressionable, heavily impacts their behavior later in life.  The miracle is that some of us are able to escape from the gender apartheid that our world wields.  We attempt to enlighten others, but most are too buried in their delusions to even try to consider what is being said.<BR>Stereotyping a person results in nothing but harm and sorry.  Honesty and dealing with each and every person, despite race, gender, creed, religion, or sexual orientation, is the only way to have a healthy relationship.  Don't trust what this man says.  He and his kind package putrid, rotten, odorous lies in funereal spices, roll them in silk and sell them as cushions to comfort those destroyed bythe gender roles of our society.  Though you may not be able to smell the stench now, it will eventually corrupt you and everything around you.
B000059XY3|1.0|I loved the first two Batman movies, but I hated this one. This one stunk! Jim Carrey is so annoying as the psychotic Riddler.  Scarface, played by Tommy Lee Jones, was pretty cool. However, this movie just wasn't as dark as the first two films. And Val Kilmer is no Micheal Keaton, who played as Batman is the last two. I think Kilmer makes a lousy replacement for Keaton. The plot in this movie is poor. The script stinks, too! Sorry. That's the way I feel about this silly mess. Batman is old anyway. How about some James Bond or Jackie Chan. Their movies are a heck of a lot better than this.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Norah's CD is the favorite in my collection. Her voice is exotic and her piano playing sets the mood for her music. I can't wait for her next CD to come out. She has so much talent.
B000069AUI|5.0|I guess the one reviewer was right: it is all down to a matter of taste. But it always is anyway.<br />But now for my opinion.<br />EXCELLENT cd. This blew me away, it really did. From the opened 'politik' with its FANTASTIC simple, melodic piano line for the bridge, to the wonderful 'clocks' and 'the scientist' (which has an awesome video) and... well, i thought the weakest song was actually 'in my place.' Truly beautiful, and i don't say that lightly. People called Travis' album 'the man who' was 'beautiful' i thought it was 'ok, but overrated.' :)  <br />Anyway, i'm glad that Coldplay don't rock out. Sure, it may be interesting to hear Chris' soft, gentle vox over some graunchy guitars but it doesn't matter that much to me. Every band tries to rock out. Whats the point? If you like soft stuff- make soft stuff. Stop trying to play to the crowd, i feel. This is gentle, melodic, simple but truly inspiring (for me, especially, being a musician.) I rate this album highly. <br />Lastly, i never liked 'yellow.' But Parachutes is a great album. Although, this album is better. I'm glad for these guys. Their third album should sure be a surprise- and i can't wait.
B000068VHQ|5.0|Cranberries never sound better with this remastered CD with 5 extra tracks! Even though I already own the first version, I cant help myself to grab this one! You should get it too. Hear for yourself and be convinced by the Complete Session!!
B00006690G|5.0|This cd rocks! Eminem is the best rappper ever. He knows how to do his beats, and his lyrics are cool(as long as you don't mind the profanity). The music in Buisness is cool. Soider rocks. Cleaning Out My Closet is one of the best songs I've ever heard, because the music is good, and the lyrics make you think. You should definetly buy this cd. It's Eminem's best yet.
0780626966|3.0|Well, i can certaintly say that for a thriller fan, this is an interesting series! Although, generally i don't like too much blood in a thriller, in this one it is unavoidable! The plot and of course the director are the ones that make it nice to watch! The concept is different than others that offer so much blood, and this is good! If your guts are strong enough you can enjoy it! If not, better don't watch it! I would basically recommend it to a thriller collector as it is quite different and interesting than others!<BR>The first movie is great. since it is the inauguration of the whole concept...<BR>The second and the third are ok, the fourth one sucks as well as fifth...Everything becomes so fake and extreme, and then i would say that the new nightmare is a nice ending to the whole story...Generally, it depends on the viewer whether or not he will find it worth spending money on or not...
B000002BBY|5.0|yeah dudes .,....you gotta buy this album......is a masterpiece of 90's alternative rock....the noel and liam are great...it has a great songwriting material and excellent vocals....I know that no self-respecting a'punk rocker\\" will rate this album in front of his friends but damn! oasis rule fellas!!
B00005JLEX|5.0|The Seinfeld series is definitely the best show to ever be produced. I would honestly pay a 1000 dollars for the entire collection of seinfled episodes on DVD.......
B00005M91K|5.0|The words mesmerizing, beautiful and astounding cannot begin to describe this wonderful DVD.  Ron Fricke is to be commended highly for this moving work of art.  I have a wide-screen HDTV and found the DVD to be much more moving than the VHS version I had seen on old TV in the past.  If you have a choice--definitely go to the widescreen DVD version.  The Dolby sound also was much enhanced over the previous version.<br />I firmly believe ALL PEOPLE should view this film at least once in their lifetime--free from all external encumbrances--this film requires your undivided attention.<br />All of a sudden, the world becomes a much smaller planet--one in which we all live in our own way and one in which every living being is important.<br />If you are prone to cry at beauty--have a box of tissues handy.  If you are not prone to cry at films, have a box of tissues handy anyway.  You will probably need them.  This is a very moving film.<br />I was particularly impressed with the burning oil field scene because of the intense feeling the film created.<br />Viewing this film should be a requirement for living on the planet.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|All their songs are great in their very own language, but since the release of the english one, ive been wanting and waiting for them to come on tour already! i love the beats and the lyrics plus the extended versions! they are great
B000002NFM|4.0|Let me start by saying, I don't really appreciate mainstream music, their are a few groups that I like that are played on the radio like Radiohead, Nirvana, Pink Floyd and Sublime, but that's about it.  Anyway, getting that out of the way..  I was a little disappointed with the direction of the group when they released it, having heard their previous cd's.  It does have some great tracks like Breathe, Naryan, Diesel Power and my favorite Climbatize.  I can't put my finger on it, but it just lacks something when compared to their previous work.  Still a good cd, worth buying if you are new to the group and wonder what all the fuss was about.  Oh, and to the person that said the rapping in Diesel Power is atrocious, I disagree, Kool Keith might not be mainstream like you are used to, but I think he has good flow and some imaginative lyrics.  Pick up this or Experience Expanded.  peace
0790729369|1.0|I was born in Iowa and love the landscape of that state, Nebraska, etc., but this movie managed to bore me to tears after a mere 45 minutes.  I have only ever walked out of two movies and this was one of them.  It was painful watching two of my favorite actors wasting their time in what was a piece of drivel to begin with, but which I had hoped would be redeemed by their presence.  No such luck, it was still unbelievable drivel.  I couldn't get the recommendation box let me say \\"anything but this!\\"
0780631684|2.0|... I have to say that I was expecting so much more from this film. The idea of death catching up to those who have avoided it makes a really cool premise for a movie, but in the end it just doesn't live up to my expectations. The acting is rather weak and the ending is pretty bad as well. If you don't take the movie too serious you probably will enjoy much more. I will admit the death seens were wickedly cool, but that still doesn't make up for a movie with so much potential that just fails to deliver.
B00005JKJA|1.0|David Lynch did a Pilot movie for a tv series.<br />He was trying to recapture his glory days of Twin Peaks.  But because of the fear of being deemed redundant and irrelevant as a director, he included a lot of freaky stuff that made no sense hoping that all the critics (failed visionaries with no visions of their own) would mistake overuse of pointless shock cinema moments and complete lack of coherence as 'visonary and artistic.'<br />Fortunately (add an UN if you really like this stuff) the TV people who make the decisions run on a much more restrictive budget than Film people.  They looked at this as just plain too wierd to even be a sleeper hit, so they pulled the plug.<br />Lynch then decided to take the pilot which had no conclusion and recut it and try and stuff some other wierd stuff into it to make it silver screen material.<br />But due to the lack of an actual complete story arc, the end result turned out to be a mess with no resolution of any sort.<br />The Genius of the marketing of this film is that it duped the audience into trying to do the work that the director couldn't do...make sense of all these random wierd scenes....when there is actually nothing to make sense of.<br />There is no understory.  It is only a bunch of half-baked story ideas for a Failed TV series that tries to Stephen King-ize Hollywood.<br />Any one of the many many different and wierd ideas might have been intriguing on their own if fleshed out and serviced properly, but instead the viewer is presented with a bunch of essentially animated (as in moving not cartoon) story board sequences, with no particular rhyme or reason but rather a gee look at this idea and now look at this idea methodology.<br />TV quality acting in these soundstage set pieces does not help either .<br />Sound Editing is very poor.<br />The Commercial Break points are still evident and almost scream 'TV ADVERTISMENT GOES HERE.'<br />Perhaps if the DVD came packed with an ounce of marijuana it might be tolerable, but frankly on its own the film is a bad trip.<br />Unless you truly believe the being wierd and confusing and pointless and unconventional is all it takes to be considered an artistic and visonary, pass this turkey up. <br />Otherwise, well misery loves company, so make sure you have someone you can't stand sitting next to you when you watch this shlock so you can atleast feel vindicated knowing someone else is suffering as much as you are...
B0000060NF|5.0|I've forced a few of my friends to buy this album, and its noticeable that many do not understand the music in the first listening. I think it can be put down to Gaye's distinct and unique harmonies, tonality, style, etc. I think this is an album which blends together many complex issues. In effect, it is like he is painting with all the colours known to man, and creating only the brilliance of white.<BR>I think it is due to this that many white, English (since I am English) people can not understand this music at first. However, if you listen to this album and don't appreciate it, I advise you listen to it again, and again, and again until you fall in love with it!<BR>I've been familiar with this album for a fairly long time(3 years). I still notice major things in the music which are so subtle, but so potentially important. The importance of 'God is Love,' is huge in the album. It has only just recently occurred to me that it, more than  'Mercy Mercy me' is the centre of the album. I have now decided that the music in 'God is Love' is based on mainly his emotions for his father, as well as God. I think his need for God, yet his inability to forgive his father, was one thing which haunted him permanently.<BR>Why doesn't every person, mature enough to understand this album, not like it?... I wander whether his father did?!
B00006JJ1O|5.0|I grew up in a very music oriented family and being so I like all different kinds of music, but it is very rare for a CD to come around that I can't stop listening to.  t.A.T.u's music is like a breath of fresh air.  It is a new sound that harkens back to other music i've heard but in such a way that I have to hear it again and again.
B00005OCMR|4.0|I first watched TRON when I was too young to remember, but I do remeber watching it. So when I bought my DVD-Player I wanted to buy this DVD. Well, what can be said about Tron? It has aged, the FX are not what I remembered, the story seems weaker but anyway, I liked the movie, I had a few good ol' memories watching it again... and you've gotta love the Light-cycle scenes... This DVD also has a good pack of extras. So, bottom line, if you liked the movie, get this DVD, even tought it can wipe away all those memories of how cool this movie was when first released, and show you the reality it is now.
B00003CXXP|1.0|This movie is painful to sit through.  I wanted the lost hours of my life back after seeing this.  Run, do not walk, away from this drivel.  The special effects are nice, and Jude Law gives a great performance, but they weren't enough to overcome the mind numbing effects of the story itself.
0446608955|5.0|What made me, a young man of twenty four, buy this book is a tale in itself. I would narrate it to you. But I am not Nicholas Sparks. <br />Bracing myself for a romantic adolescent melodrama, I decided to read the book as quickly as possible to get it over with. Nary a chapter later, I was hooked.<br />When I reached the latter half of the book, I found the going tough. It wasn't the language or the content that was slowing me down. Teary eyes had blurred my sight, and I found myself reaching for the box of Kleenex at the end of every line.<br />The time was an hour past midnight. The book was read; my eyes were red. As I lay there in bed, trying to force myself to sleep, my mind kept conjuring up images from the book. Each brought a swell of tears to my eyes. I was sad, but I was happy to be sad. <br />\\"A Walk to Remember\\" is a voyage of discovery for two teenagers through the uncharted waters of first love. Even in an age where love and lust are synonymous, this tale made me long for love that's chaste. I wanted to be seventeen again, freed from the shackles of adulthood, and my innocence restored. <br />I wanted to fall in love again.
0066214122|2.0|In Prey Michael Crichton rehashes the story of Jurassic Park, except this time instead of dinosaurs you have a swarm of killer nano-bots and instead of an island it takes place in the desert.  The book reads like the screenplay he is sure to develop from it and quite frankly he should have just skipped the whole writing a book and gone straight to Hollywood.<br />It's a fast read and an ok story, but wait for the paperback.
B00003CXS4|4.0|This Movie is cool, more than cool it's fresh, it has a great direction. Even tought I've heard it's very similar to &quot;Lock, Stock...&quot; also from Guy Ritchie, I haven't seen that last one. Anyway... this DVD has a few featurettes, deleted scenes and the very welcomed &quot;pikey&quot; subtitle option (used when Brad Pitt's character speaks). It even has an option where you can play the deleted scenes where they were suposed to be (even tough the deleted scenes look horrible) my only complaint would be its lack of spanish subtitles. Again the R4 edition is a Single Disc Edition and I don't think it has all the extras this one has.
B00005JL78|4.0|I can't say that I was all that thrilled by this film... I was surprised by what a good job Steven Spielberg did directing past Tom Cruise's overstuffed ego, and I thought the dystopian sci-fi future he came up with was kind of interesting, but ultimately this didn't really hang together that well.  The premise of the psychics used by the police state didn't quite make sense, and the run-and-hide phase of the film seemed interminable and choppily paced.  Also: when the super-duper cyberstate turns against you, don't they kind of automatically turn off your access cards and top-security passes?  Why was Cruise's cop character still able to get into restricted areas if they were able to track his every move?  Visually, this had its fine points, but again, I felt like the direction was a little too loose... The gee-whiz scene at hte beginning with Cruise waving his magic VR gloves and making the hi-tech computer images dance goes on way too long; like many things in this film, it could have stood a little tightening up.  I did enjoy Spielberg's small, goofy slapstick moments, though.  It was great to see a big, mega-blockbuster filmmaker still able to pause and take time out for a well-timed gag or two.  This was ok, but it could have been better.
0151008116|5.0|Life of Pi is one of the best books I've ever read. I was captivated throughout. Pi has so much faith and hope that I think (maybe) some of it rubbed off on me. Everyone should read this book!
B000021YQV|5.0|To begin with, I LOVE this cd; however, when I purchased 'Toxicity' I was expecting all of the tunes to have the harmonies present in Chop Suey! and (the song) Toxicicity. That was not the case. Not all of these tracks are quite as catchy (at first) as the songs getting radio play.<br />With that said, this is an incredible cd! It'll definitely be on your list of cd's that make you drive about 80 miles/hour on the highway without even noticing. This cd has some heavy material on it, great for unwinding after a long day. There's some serious intensity on this disc that I can't describe in words. I picked up the disc after hearing Chop Suey! and Toxicicty and it's been in heavy rotation in the car ever since.<br />If you're looking for somthing heavy, pick this up. But just know that it's not all &quot;Chop Suey!&quot; and &quot;Aerials&quot;. <br />If you're going to purchase this cd, you might want to pick up one of the &quot;special&quot; discs.  There's one with a free DVD and another with a free CD-ROM, if you can still find them.
B00003CXXP|4.0|OK, a lot of people went to see A.I. thinking it would be some kind of sci-fi action movie or something, being this an unfinished Kubrik Project I did the rigth thing, went to see it, not knowing what to expect from it. the result? I liked it very much it has that old sci-fi novel feeling, when the conception of the future and things to come was just something to aid the story, and not something to carry the whole story or to base the story on. I liked very much the way it's so similar to Pinochio (even in the end, the original Pinochio, I mean). This DVD has a bunch of extras interesting to all of those who like FX &amp; mainly CGI. Well worth the buy.
1572523166|5.0|Well, yeah, \\"Star Wars\\" was fun and all, \\"Close Encounters\\" was trippy... But this sex'n'drugs-laden cult classic is probably the single best sci-fi film of the 1970s... At least it's the most intelligent of the lot.  I first saw this movie when I was ten years old, had my mind blown, and was happy to recently discover how well it holds up.  Davie Bowie (wow.) stars as a dissolute alien marooned on our primitive planet, desperately trying to get back home, where an environmental disaster looms that will decimate his world.  Our world turns out to be pretty tough, too, though.  At first his \\"Mr. Newton\\" plays cat-and-mouse with our economy -- placing radical new \\"inventions\\" into the consumer market, he makes zillions of dollars and becomes an unwilling celebrity.  But he is soon thwarted by sinister forces and his own unsuspected weaknesses for pop culture, booze, and kinky sex.  A fine parable for the diversion of '60s creativity into '70s hedonism, as well as a brilliantly realized science fiction/magic realist film noir.  Plus, this film intersects perfectly with Bowie's earlier self-mythologization as the rock god Ziggy Stardust and not-so-subtle hints of his own extraterrestrial origins.  Devoted Bowie fans simply have to see this movie -- fans of 'Seventies pop and trash culture will also want to drink it in.
0385720920|2.0|Let me start by saying I like Chuck's work. I thought fight club and survivor were very good but this one was substandard. Like alot of his work the characters are one dimensional and that is ok if the action of the plot moves fast enough but sadly this is not the case. None of these characters (except Denny)are sympathetic and I did not connect with any of them. I was struck by how masoginistic our antihero Victor is. As with other of his books chuck uses the protagonist to spout slogans but there were few that we could hold on to. i recomend this book only to those devotees of Chucky P's work who worship him or those who are between the ages of 17-19 They'll like it.
B000002UAU|5.0|Whenever a reviewer like the one below gives this album a fair rating or calls it overrated then compares it with something like pet sounds you can pretty much disregard it as prejudiced.This album is not overrated and is in as much need of re-evaluation as mozart or beethoven as it is a timeless masterpiece. The previous reviewer was right about one thing it isn't the best ever but aside from perhaps ok computer it can ONLY be topped imo by other beatles albums. NOT revolver btw but abbey road. And certainly not something as lightweight as pet sounds. Bottom line this album from start to finish is a classic and must buy!
B00005JKZT|5.0|Im a huge LOTR fan, having read the books several times for about 20 years now, I had already wondered why noone had made the movie... till Peter Jackson came around with this impressive representation. I will not spoil the movie in case you havent read the book, so feel free to read on...<br />First of all, watch the fellowship before the two towers. (yes, reading the book helps, but if you want to experience the two towers at the most, see the fellowship).<br />The film picks up right where \\"fellowship\\" left off, and carries on much in the way the books do- back and forth the three storylines. Even though it lasts three hours (im sorry-- 2:59), you wont notice the time (unless you have to go to the bathroom) and by the end, ushers will have to carry you out because you want more... you will hope the lights are on and people are leaving because its an intermission... but no luck.<br />The film has spectacular visual effects, beautiful landscapes and impressive \\"massive\\" battle sequences. Jackson manages to either make you forget you are watching a movie or make you think he spent 3 billion on each film due to the realism of each creature, beit the Ents, orcs, wargs or Gollum (which im sure will get an award for realism)... they all look real and move like they were real individual actors. And the real actors each deserve awards for their work, expect to laugh with Gimli's remarks and be shocked by every actor!<br />What can I tell you... a masterpiece that will be remembered for ages, I thank P.J. for making the movie now that technology is so advanced, and for dedicating so much time and effort to it. He has an enormous responsability towars the fans and readers of the second best selling book in all time (after the bible) and has delivered once more with \\"The Two Towers\\".<br />Unfortunately the movie ends and you are left not hungry... you are left STARVING for more! Im a huge fan of LOTR and P.J., so this is what I feel... Im not sure how youll feel, but im sureyou'll love it. I cant wait for the DVD to come out!<br />Congratulations, P.J.!

B00005R2M3|1.0|i found maybe one borderline decent song.Yeah, it would be a borderline decent song if sung by someone else...It is so unpleasant, and lacks range,power, and intensity...And I don't care if Shakira writes her own music.It's not like it's good music.All the songs sound exactly the same and there is no variety.The production sounds cheap, and everything sounds terribly rushed.I don't know how anyone can like her music or that voice!!
0345413377|5.0|The Amber Spyglass is classified as young adult, but it can be of interest to many other audiences as well. Older people as well as younger children would enjoy the story line and characters. I think the ideal audience would be adults from 18-25. This is an age where you have experienced the world more and could relate to a lot of the subjects that are touched upon in the book. This book really stirred my emotions because it dealt with religion in a very different sense. I've always been unsure about God and other realms, and in this book \\"God\\" is portrayed as someone evil who has tricked everyone into believing there is a heaven, when everyone just goes to a dismal place called the land of the dead. It made me really think about what I believed in, and how strongly I felt about my viewpoint. I decided I really do believe in a heaven, but not in a powerful, all knowing being. The characters are original and lifelike, mainly because they are so human in nature, yet so amazingly brave. Lyra and Will, the main children who take on a task beyond impossible, have ferocious courage and determination to do what's right. In one scene, Lyra gives up her heart and soul to go down to the land of the dead to save an old friend. Will also risked his life many times to save Lyra from dangerous situations when foes try to kidnap and kill her. The plot was also fantastic because of all the creative situations Pullman thought up. The children encounter birds of the dead, strange new creatures, and killer priests. I thought this book was awesome because of all the elements Pullman weaved throughout his story. The plot was action filled and made the readers rethink a lot of their own opinions.
B00007BH5C|5.0|Much has already been said and written in praise of Howard Shore's brilliant score for \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\"  Most interesting have been the various and expected comparisons with Wagner's Ring Cycle.  But while there are obvious similarities in scope, length, complexity and to a certain degree subject matter, Shore's masterpiece seems to move in another direction.  Here one might be reminded that there is still some argument about the national inspiration for J.R.R. Tolkien himself.  Celtic, Nordic, Icelandic, Germanic?  Indeed, the more pertinent sources for both Tolkien and Shore seem to echo Finnish origins, \\"The Lemminkainen\\" epic, and of course its wonderful musical rendition by the great Jean Sibelius.  \\"The Two Towers,\\" Shore's second act in his musical trilogy for the Tolkien epic suggests these influences much more than Wagner, especially in his treatment of Rohan and the Rohirrim, the horse lords, which becomes the dominating musical foundation of this chapter.  Upon first exposure to this score one might be moved to comment that this is simply a reinterpretaion of themes introduced in \\"The Fellowship of the Ring,\\" but such a view would fail to recognize several new musical themes and motifs, the themes for Rohan and Gollum/Smeagol especially.  In particular, these two thematic elements are beautiful and fascinating, the latter so tragic, the former so poignant and ultimately heroic.  There is also a new treatment of an elvish theme that appears in the \\"Helm's Deep\\" music which is both mysterious and majestic.  Shore's choral arrangements remain stunning and the vocal version \\"Gollum's Song\\" is absolutely pathetic, as it is meant to be.  And here there is yet another element that separates Shore and Tolkien from Wagner, the latter is tragic, the former, particularly with \\"The Two Towers,\\" may be dark but is, in the final analysis, hopeful and triumphant as Shore announces emphatically in the orchestral coda that follows \\"Gollum's Song.\\"  The soundtrackis nicely packaged and produced by Warner Bros., but one wonders why this album and its predessor were not produced as two disc sets to give worthy treatment to these monumental scores?
0792106989|5.0|There are a lot of great Westerns but my favorite by far is The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance.  It showcases two of the greatest actors in movie history, John Wayne and Jimmy Stewart.  Wayne plays his typical rough and tumble but moral cowboy/ranch owner role.  But the greatness of Wayne was the way he played these roles.  He was a great actor, a lot better actor then he was ever allowed to portray, but knew what the public wanted and he gave it too them.  This role was one of his best,  The Searchers and The Shootest are the only roles better.  Stewart is so conviecing in this movie that you forget it's Jimmy Stewart you are watching(which is what made him great in all of his movies)  He shines as the idealistic lawyer forced into a fight for his life.  The story is told in a flashback by Stewart's character of events that happened 50 years earlier.  It is a story of two men that stood up for what they believed in.  Lee Marvin is pure evil as Liberty Valance, a great role.  The rest of the supporting cast is wonderful.  Valance is not only a great western but a great movie as well.    A +++++++++++++
B00006M183|1.0|Thankfully I got this used, or I would've been mighty disaapointed at having paid full price for it. The reason why people like this is because they're PJ fans. I mean, that's the only explanation as to why such an uninteresting album seems to have gotten such rave reviews. I can sum up Riot Act in one letter: zzzzzzz.
B00005QIPH|2.0|Really, these guys are still only getting their feet wet.  It is far too early to claim The Strokes to be very much of anything, at least until they release their next full-length album and then see where it goes.  I can't really say I like this band per say, because we all know that it has been done before with far better results.  One of the major problems I have with this band is that their is no real creative edge to what they do, and their music by no means packs a punch.  So is this some sort of new variation of Rock 'N' Roll music that actually doesn't rock???  It also amazes me that groups like The White Stripes and The Strokes have gotten so much media hype within the last year or so, and yet the great freak-out rockin' music of the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion has yet to receive its due.  Anyhow, as far as The Strokes go...there's just gotta be someone pulling the strings behind the scenes.
B00007E8V4|5.0|This album is the best that I have heard from System. I like it alot. This is the most diverse music there System has made. The question that I have is \\"Why the hell didnt they release this album earlier?\\" To me It is quite better then Toxcity.

B00005JKZT|5.0|It is the best movie of the year and I do believe it will out-gross the first film seeing as how people who were fans before and new fans of the story will likely want to see the saga continue.  Brilliantly done and wonderful to watch.  At a three-hour long ride, I still continued to grip the seat handles until the very end and didn't dare wonder off to go to the bathroom.  One word of advice, don't drink before you enter or risk holding it for three hours.  I would probably have sat through the thrid one as well - for a grand total of six hours, but then that one doesn't come out for another year.  All I can say is, I can't wait for the DVD release of the Two Towers and next years theatrical release of the Return of the King.

B00000K2SC|5.0|This movie is nothing short of an allegory.  As I walked out of the theater I thought increduously, &quot;I wonder how many people realize how true this movie is?&quot;  <br />Not only does this movie deliver in terms of action, suspense, plot and soundtrack, it's here to teach us something.  Waking up is no fun, but choosing to sleep is worse.  Which will it be for you: the red pill or the blue pill?
0670824399|1.0|I find it hard to believe an acclaimed author would promote disrespect, mental abuse of children, physical abuse of children, revenge, and poor language.  I found the book to provide a very NEGATIVE outlook on life and not the least bit entertaining.
B00005Y228|4.0|\\"la, la, la...la, la, la, la, la\\" funny how lyrics as simple as this could make such a global hit. Of course these belong to first cut \\"Can't get you out of my head\\", a perfect title to describe the effect of the tune on our minds.<br />  Danceable track after track, \\"Fever\\" represents a huge welcome back to Kylie to planet pop. Throughout the twelve tracks she whispers, sings, and makes you dance, dance and dance.<br />  The singles have been well chosen. The second song released was \\"It's in your eyes\\" not as catchy as the first hit, but definitely another winner. Hot on the heels of this came \\"Love at first sight\\" a track that would be no stranger in a Daft Funk album and \\"Come into my world\\" the weakest of the singles as it goes in the same direction as the previous songs.<br />  Other songs to pay attention to are the one that entitles the cd and \\"Burning up\\" the final song on the cd.<br />  Nothing from \\"Fever\\" will surprise you, if you liked any of the songs from the disc, then you are sure to enjoy the rest of the album. It's as much predictable as enjoyable.<br />  Kylie is disco queen and seeing there's not even one slow moment in the whole album we can understand why! If you wanna have fun and listen to some music to dance to, and if you are not ashamed of the cheesy it may get at times, then you should really give this a try!.
B00006CXSS|5.0|My hats off to anyone involved in the making of this movie, as well as those who actually served.<br />My favorite episode is number nine, &quot;Why We Fight&quot;.  After 9/11, it alone can explain the reasons why our nation strives to stand for freedom and justice; we may not always achieve those goals in the purest sense, but at least we aim towards it.  Not a day goes by where I don't take a moment alone to cry over 9/11, and not once have I failed to cry when seeing this episode - if you think long and hard, on some level the tragedy of these events are one and the same.<br />May God Bless the United States of America.
B000002UAR|5.0|Rubber Soul is entertaining but lacks ambition, Sgt. Pepper is pretentious and unfulfilling, Abbey Road is sporadically brilliant but more often indulgent, and the White Album is just poor. Revolver, however, is a masterpiece. <br />It is worth buying the album for the opening two songs alone, Harrison's 'Taxman' and McCartney's 'Eleanor Rigby', but there is so much more of value here. The epic closer 'Tomorrow Never Knows' was one of the Beatles' great leaps forward, and tracks like 'Dr. Robert' (an ode to Lennon's dealer, apparently) and 'And Your Bird Can Sing' are among the best pop-rock songs of the era. <br />I refuse to join in with the unthinking canonisation of everything the Beatles ever did, but I won't question the legitimacy of Revolver's position near the top of most 'Greatest Albums Ever' surveys.
B00005JL96|4.0|Although not one of the most superior of Disney animated films ever made (see Little Mermaid, Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast, or many of the &quot;classics&quot;), it's certainly no Atlantis or Treasure Planet, thankfully.  It's very watchable and entertaining for adults and children alike.  The animation is traditional Disney quality, along with some enjoyable new characters.  And even though I'm not an Elvis fan by any stretch of the imagination, his music was not distracting to the film.  Regarding the extras on the DVD, the &quot;Inter-Stitch-als&quot; are a delight.  They were the commercials introducing Stitch during a sequence from other famous Disney animated films.  But don't be mislead into thinking that there are more specially made for this DVD.  The &quot;history&quot; of Stitch showing up in older classic Disney films is merely a bunch of sketches and pictures from older films with Stitch poorly added to the scene; there's no animation involved, so it's not of Disney quality whatsoever.  Don't let this distract you from the enjoyable film, though! (But don't bother watching that extra either!)
B00005JL78|4.0|First off I'll agree with the majority of the reports posted here about the film, but everyone left off one thing:<br />This DVD should be nominated for the worst extras ever award.

B00006CXXU|5.0|I've read the other reviews posted here, and must say that I could not disagree more with all the nay sayers. While I agree that Christina would do well to cover up her body a bit more, who are we to judge what she feels comfortable wearing? We're talking about a CD, about MUSIC and the way this artist delivers it. <br />Christina is a jewel so easily glossed over by the fashion police. Why not listen to her sing, to the colour and feeling in her voice. She is able to sing a wide variety of music and still retain her own identity while not sacrificing the piece to do it. How can you listen to tracks like \\"I'm Ok\\", \\"Beautiful\\" and \\"Impossible\\" without recognizing that her talent is bone deep and very \\"Underappreciated\\".<br />One review I read made many references to the lyrics of one particular song \\"Get Mine, You Get Yours\\", for the individual who had such a problem with this song,I can only say . . . Welcome to Reality! There are many people who live those relationships, why not write a song about it? Does it make you a \\"slut or whore\\" to enjoy a responsible sex life? Does that make her views on woman's eqality (\\"Can't Hold Us Down\\") any less powerful? I feel bad for those who believe that a musician can only perform songs that are 100% true to their lives. A true musician can sing songs that have nothing to do with their real lives. Does it stand to reason that every artist in history has experienced the same things the characters in their songs do? Isn't that the same as saying that an actress can not convey a realistic performance of a rape vicitm umless she was raped in reality?<br />All of the arguments aside, let me just say with 150% confidence that Christina Aguilera is on her way to becoming one of the best vocalists around. She has the range, the chops and the capablitly and musical timing to lead her on to higher and higher levels of professional success! Good for you Girl!
6305132984|5.0|It is extremely disappointing for me to read negative remarks on what is undoubtedly an absolutely classic musical. Movies like West Side Story and Sound of Music are simply beyond critique as they have touched the hearts of millions of people throughout the world and inspired countless composers. As for a remake, we truly would have quite a task finding directors to the equal of Robert Wise AND Jerome Robbins in today's age; not to mention the unenviable task of re-casting  the unforegettable Rita Moreno as Anita. I absolutely agree with the gentleman who recommends such reality-based gems as &quot;Jackass the Movie&quot; to the viewer from Oregon; Bravo! What are we going to attack next, Lawrence of Arabia. Good Lord, get a life! Critique the technical merit of the DVD, not the content of an accepted classic.
B000068R1X|2.0|This, the third album of Ozzy's solo career, has all of its songs crdited exclusively to Ozzy. This another fine example of how things work in the sbourn&eacute;s clan (Sharon and Ozzy).<br />The truth is: Bob Daisley wrote all the lyrics not only for BARK AT THE MOON, but also fpor BLIZZARD OF OZZ and DIARY OF A MADMAN.<br />In Bark At The Moon, Daisley and Jake Lee wrote 95% of the material....<br />The truth is that Ozzy made the first and almost fatal mistake of his solo career right in the beginning when, due to Sharon's friendship with drummer Tommy Aldridge, he wanted to get rid of original drummer Lee Kerslake, who was wroking perfectly for the band... Bob Daisley did not accept it and was fired too...Rudy Sarzo and TOmmy Aldridge, who did not play a single note in DIARY OF A MADMAN, were credited of doing it...<br />THis is the reason for the legal battle that Daisley and Kerslake are fighting against Ozzy: they simply did not receive one cent of a dollar for the sales of a multi-platinum album which they did all the bass and drums work!!!<br />Reasonings aside, BARK AT THE MOON is the first album without Randy Rhoads, killed in a stupid flying accident in March 19, 1982. Ozzy, needing some talent urgently, called Bob Daisley back, because Rudy Sarzo is not a writer at all. Daisley and new guitarist Jake E. Lee did the best they could, but the fact is that the magic of the original line up was simply gone, and they could not capture it back... The result was a good album, nothing more than that, but with better production than the first two (because now Ozzy had a little more time to record it).
B00006JJ1O|5.0|This cd is a moscow work of art. The way tatu put together this fabulous creation of emotions and rebellion is un real. They not only have great voices but they use them to tell people who they are and that they don't give a sh** what they think.
B000000W5B|4.0|Despite the fact that this album succeeded what are arguably the best albums The Rolling Stones ever recorded, this is still a SOLID album, complete with the solid bluesy s***-kicking songs and some ballads. The remastering was very well done, and the album is as vibrant (if not more so) than it would be coming fresh out of the sleeve. <BR>  If it were not for the overplayed and highly overrated \\"Angie\\" and the absence of Brian Jones, this album may have been placed in the pantheon of the top five 'Stones albums. Alas, this album is lucky to break into the top ten. <BR>  Compared to most of the rest of the Stones' output after this point however, Goat's Head is a veritable triumph. Many critics gave Tattoo You a better rating than this album out of nostalgia, but had this album been released in 1981 in Tatoo's stead, it would have been deservedly rated much higher.<BR>  If you are a Rolling Stones fan this album is a necessity. Not as much so as Exile, Beggar's, Let it Bleed and about seven more albums, but it's up there. <BR>   This is a Rolling Stones album from the high point of their career - don't penalize it because it's merely excellent.
B00005JJUF|4.0|What is the Matrix? That's the question everyone's looking to answer in this sci-fi spectacular from Wachowski brothers. One thing it was -- groundbreaking both in the spectacular special effects that we've since taken for granted.<BR>Computer hacker extraordinaire Neo (Reeves) has this gut feeling that life isn't all that it seems to be. Turns out he's right in a big way. A group of revolutionaries led by the thought to be mythical Morpheus (Fisburne) open his eyes to the Matrix.<BR>The Matrix, it turns out, is nothing more than an elaborate computer generated reality intended to mollify humanity who are in reality nothing more than sheep or in this case a renewable energy source, to feed the machines that have inherited the Earth.<BR>Morpheus believes Neo is \\"The One\\", a prophesized savior who can bend the Matrix to his own will who will eventually lead humanity out of slavery.
B00006L83N|5.0|\\"The Odyssey\\" begins where \\"V: The New Mythology Suite\\" (from 2000) leaves off. Almost 3 years in the making... I truly believe \\"The Odyssey\\" was worth the wait. Russell Allen (vocals), Mike Romeo (guitars), and crew are once again in mesmerizing rare form. Where \\"V\\" seemed more concerned with melody and orchestration, \\"Odyssey\\" is a bit more raw and in your face metal. Sure, there are the trademark epic songs (6-7-8 minute tracks; not to mention the tital track - 24 minutes), and the ever present odd meter grooves... but the guitars are crunchier and the songs seemingly faster, and the lightning quick solo's blaze as fast or faster than previous releases. Check out the lead track (\\"Inferno\\"), and \\"King Of Terrors\\"... these songs will kick you in the teeth. Then get ready for the slower \\"Accolade II\\" and \\"Awakenings\\"... simply beautiful pieces of art. Included in this CD are extensive liner notes, band members thoughts on each song, beautiful artwork, and all song lyrics. The cover art is taken from the title track \\"Part V - Sirens\\" - those damn false bringers of love. If you know Ulysses' story (The Odyssey)... you'll recognize all the familiar happenings of his several decade journey to return to Ithica and wife Penelope, encounters with the Cyclops, Circe and Sirens. Symphony X is the definition of progressive metal. Easy pick for 2002 top rock/progressive album.
B0000784XP|5.0|A superb selection of the best tracks from their three albums. The choice is superb, if you liked 'Lifted' or 'Ocean Drive' this album is full of tracks of similar quality and feel. It does what every Greatest Hits album should do - make you want to go out and buy the original albums. The two extra tracks are also very good and make the album worth buying for those who have the three previous albums.<BR>Unfortunately this album also has the most stupid technological invention of the past few years - copy protection. This means it won't play in my computers C-drive and as I listen to much of my music there this is extremely annoying. If it worked I could understand it (but not like it), however copy protection is easy to bypass and all of these tracks are already available over the internet. Copy protection just annoys those of us who buy the actual albums, it doesn't stop piracy! (I think Amazon should state if CDs are copy protected so that we can choose whether to buy them or not as you can do this in real world record stores)
B0000683DH|5.0|This was always my favorite Star Trek movie when I was a kid.  It is still among my favorites.  The space battles are remarkable; especially for the era in which they were made.  Industrial Light and Magic, George Lucas's special effects company, spearheaded the f/x on the film.  Always ahead of their time, groundbreakers I.L.M. created some rather amazing battles that scar the newly refitted U.S.S. Enterprise.  <br />Ricardo Montalbon was great.  Reprising the role of \\"Khan\\" from the original series, Mr. Montalbon was the ultimate arch enemy.   The story was pretty good and was a vast improvement over Star Trek: The Motion Picture. <br />I bought the special edition of this with some of the edited scenes cut back into the movie. Some were interesting, but only one, I thought was needed. I won't get into them because they are a bit of a surprise for those who have seen the movie and would not make sense to those who have never seen the movie. Probably the most dramatic scene in the history of Star Trek takes place at the end of this movie.  Again, can't spoil in case some one on earth hasn't seen it.  <br />This is a really good movie.  I enjoyed it thoroughly and continue to do so to this day, almost 20 years after the first time I saw it. . . <br />epc

It even goes back far enough to explain about the first semi-video games- Pinball. Pack with a smorgasbord of comments by famous video game heavy hitters(such as Shigeru Miyamoto, Howard Lincoln, and Hideo Kojima) it sucker punches the reader with dazzling amounts of info. There is also a forward by the creator of god game Black & White. Kent's occupation of a sports journalist and video game geek shows through his documentary style approach to this massive book. Notable segments in the book include the historic battle between Universal and Nintendo over the Donkey Kong video game. (Universal claimed that Donkey Kong was too similiar to King Kong and it infringed upon it's property.) Also the much deliberated violence in video-games issue with Mortal Kombat and Doom are discussed. The only thing which could have been improved could be the small black and white photos in the middle of the book, it just isn't up to snuff with the rest of the book. Otherwise it's a great read for the geek in you.<BR>                 -As reported by that famous journalist-<BR>                           Nine-tendo!
0316666343|2.0|When I read the first part of this book, I was hooked.  I even got a couple of friends to start reading it and was recommending it to everyone.  But, halfway through the book, I felt the author losing focus and direction.  The George Harvey character deserved more than 3 lines to describe what happens to him.  I found the interaction between Ruth (as Susie) and Ray a little farfetched, even given the spiritual tones of the book. Disappointing and anticlimactic...

B0000640VO|4.0|The package says &quot;The feel-good movie of the year,&quot; and when I heard the basic plot, how Amelie discovers helping other people, I was expecting a pleasant but serious movie, the touchy-feely kind.  &quot;Aw, isn't that special.&quot;  So I was only mildly interested in it before watching.<br />But it really caught me by surprise.  First of all, I was surprised by how funny it was.  I wasn't expecting it to be funny, but many lines made me bust out laughing.  Second, I was entranced with the beautiful world of the movie, a lovely type of fantasy.  I loved the way Amelie and the &quot;glass bones man&quot; talked about a girl in the painting he was working on when they both knew they were really talking about Amelie.  I loved the magic of the streets of Paris, the deeply interesting variety of characters in the movie, and particularly shy Amelie's charming mannerisms.  Adding to movie is the music which so perfectly fits, solidly contributing to the movie's good feeling, and also the unusual cinematic effects, including the way inanimate objects sometimes briefly came to life.<br />Often after watching a movie on DVD, I like to watch some of the extra material--deleted scenes, movie trailers, etc.  But after watching this movie, I couldn't even imagine destroying the beauty of the fantasy with such stuff.<br />So I watched the extras on a different day.  My favorites in the extras:  1) When the director and cinematographer discuss the use of color; it was enlightening and helped me realize one of the reasons I liked the movie so much.  Their use of color was not something I had noticed consciously while watching the film, but after hearing them discuss their use of color, I understood a part of what made this movie so appealing to me (I love color!).  2) It's called &quot;Fantasies of Audrey Tautou&quot; but really it's outtakes.  But what's amazing is how charming she is even when she's veering off the script.  3) It was interesting to see the original storyboard directly compared with the final result in one scene.<br />Normally I don't watch the interviews with the directors, but I did with this one and found it to be interesting enough.  But I'm not a hard core movie buff; I basically just watch movies and that's it.  I generally don't even know the actors' names (except for really big ones), let alone the directors.<br />For me, the extras are fine as far as DVD extras go, but this movie is such a delightful charming fantasy, the extras take away from that magic.  I'll leave those for the hardcore movie buffs and just watch the lovely story again and again.<br />(By the way, I couldn't decide whether to rate it 4 stars or 5; when in doubt I go the conservative route.

0375707972|4.0|I expected this book wouldn't suit everyone's taste, but I am shocked that many people found the book a waste of time.  I also can't believe that so many people have reviewed it in a way that gave so much away!<br />I found this book to be a very good read.  I had minor issues with the way the plot worked it's way out, but then again, reading would stink if everything always turned out the way I expected it would.<br />The best part about The Reader for me is that it ties a substantial historical event to the relationship of two average people.  Schlink's message on the betrayal in a relationship is right on the money.  It was clear to me that both Hanna and Michael had roles in destroying their relationship, although Hanna played a heavier hand.  As other reviewers have stated, there was also the issue of Michael being at the wrong time in his life for this relationship.  Anyone that did like this book from the mixed age relationship \\"Mrs. Robinson\\" perspective should read A Widow For One Year by John Irving.<br />As I stated, I really enjoyed the book and it was a fast read.  I was ever so slightly disappointed in the end.  I can't give it 5 stars, as I wouldn't place it in my favorites for all time, but it was one of the best I read this year.  It is worth reading at least once, and pay careful attention to Michael's own betrayal.  It is a valuable life lesson to anybody.  I will read it again someday.

But, aside from the technology that Chricton delves in to (as usual), the story kept me turning the pages.  What held me the most was the antagnost that was neither phantomesque nor man, but something one may never conceive of.  The story did tend to dwindle a bit toward the end, but it was a quick read.  Chricton is now officially out of the dog house for giving us Airframe.

B000024D4R|4.0|Let me first say that Animals is not for anyone who hasn't experienced a little Floyd. I don't recommend picking this up if you haven't heard Dark Side, Wish you Were Here, or the Wall first because this may steer you the wrong way when it comes to Floyd. Although Animals is a genius piece of work and very acoustic when compared to Dark Side, or Wish you Were Here, I don't recommend this to anyone who isn't big into Floyd. This album is incredibly deep, in my opinion too deep for anyone not seasoned to Floyd and it may be a tad difficult for people who aren't used to the beautiful chaos that is Pink Floyd to understand. I say that because Animals is very charged w\social commentary on the issues from betrayl to human rights; and those not used to Roger Waters' way of expressing himself might be a tad turned off by this album and it's message. Bottom line: if you've experienced a little Floyd pick this up by all means; it's beyond excellent.<br />&quot;Pig man...Pig maaan...haha she'll ride you out...&quot;
B00006BTCA|4.0|I don't have the full-length disc yet, but the song NYC appeared on an Uncut sampler a few months ago.  I hear a hint of Ian Curtis, but I hear more than a hint of the first Dead Can Dance album (and also Clan of Xymox).  I really like the old Factory and 4AD records, so I do want to hear the rest of the CD to see whether these impressions hold up.
B000002U82|5.0|I can NOT stress enough in my review the impact and excellency of Dark Side of the Moon. If you enjoy a jazz fusion\somewhat electronic sound you will absolutely love Dark Side; Floyd's greatest. The jazz influence here is quite heavy; w\ the smooth sax on Us and Them, the jazz guitar on Time, and the funky saxophone solo on Money; all excellent tunes. Every song on this album is a classic; Dark Side is one of the few cds that every time I put in, I'll listen to all the way through. Just buy it if your new to Floyd; I can guarantee you'll love it.<br />&quot;Money, it's a gas...grab that cash with both hands and make a stash...&quot;

B00005JKZT|5.0|Having just seen this film for the second time in 1 1/2 days, I now think I can write a reasonable review. All I can say is : WOW! Simply stunning. There are some significant departures from the book, so be warned, all you tolkien-purists. Having read the trilogy many, many, many times since high school( it being my all-time favorite book), it took a couple of viewings to be truly at ease with it. I won't go into a full-scale plot outline here, only to say that the film moves on its own, independent of the book, much like the Fellowship of the Ring did. It's a stand-alone piece, and is a very worthy successor to the first film. <BR>The pace moves along at a great clip, and handles the three story lines quite well, without losing the audiences' attention. <BR>The acting in this film seems of a higher caliber for most involved, which is saying something, since the acting in the first film was mostly top-notch. The visual effects are astounding. One word: Gollum. This CG creation seems to live and breath on film like a true actor, holding his own with anyone in the film. Such misery, such wretchedness, such deceit. The film will likely win the academy award for best visual effects based on his charactor alone, and most deservedly so. I'm sure some will whine about the length of the film( one minute shy of 3 hours), or the alteration of the story line( the charactor of Faramir, for instance), or the increased violence( the battle of Helm's Deep), but this is all moot. This is a fine, fine film, and will stand as an achievement of the first rank, only to be likely topped by next year's finale, The Return of the King. Please seet his film and enjoy it for its own merits, which are many. There is much to enjoy and be thrilled by. What a work of art.

B00007E8V4|5.0|This latest System of a Down CD marks a return to the band's classic sound, message and mindset (or lack thereof).  Toxicity, while an excellent album in many ways, failed to recapture the frenetic and witty tone of the self-titled debut.  While Steal This Album doesn't play at the breakneck pace of their first album, it displays the same wit, insanity, and political acumen (a complete bundle of contradictions).  Songs like \\"IEAIAIOand \\"Pictures\\" showcase some of Serj Tankian's crazy vocals which were mostly absent from Toxicity.  Daron's harmonizing vocals are less intrusive and seem to fit better, or maybe I'm just getting used to him.  His guitar work is heavy, solid, and at times mirrors Serj's vocals.  In terms of content, the band's political views seem to have crystallized and the album presents a cohesive and powerful message denouncing globalization and lifting up the individual.  Songs like \\"A.D.D.\\" and \\"Boom!\\" and \\"Mr. Jack\\" drive this message home.  My only real complaint is that a couple of songs near the end of the album like \\"Ego Brain\\" and \\"Thetawaves\\" kind of drag and don't match up with the rest of the disc.  The beautiful \\"Roulette\\" and the catchy \\"Streamline\\" make up for it.<br />So, in spite of its occasional lapses, I still give this CD five stars for its in-your-face yet deep yet quirky style, for its potent political message, and for its overall refusal to conform to the machine of popular music.  It's really a shame that this album didn't get a lot of promotion, because it's one of the best albums of the year.  Rock on SOAD.
B00004Z459|5.0|This is the only cd in my collection, that I've had for over two years, and I'm still in love with it. It got me through a rough spot in my life, and the lyrics showed me not to take crap from anyone also there is somewhere out there who feels just like you.
B0000640VO|5.0|I have not seen a movie that just makes you feel so good after watching, but this is one of them. Amelie is a pure delight of the soul as one girl trys to help everyone with there problem but herself. The comedy is rich and full of life. from the suicidle goldfish, to a traveling gnome. This is the one movie you come away with a smile and fall in love with Amelie.
B00004T9UF|5.0|At the time of this review, it has been almost 2 and a half years since the release of Eminem's highly successful and highly controversial sophomore album, \\"The Marshall Mathers LP.\\"  Alot has changed since then: Eminem has grown into a wiser lyricist and even a quality producer; people are still taking shots at Eminem because he is a white rapper in a black man's world; and Eminem is still the same angry blonde we all know and love...or despise, which ever you prefer.<br />Even when Eminem calls it quits and retires from hip-hop completely, the moment that all of his fans and critics will remember him for will be this album.  It has become the most successful hip-hop album to date, it garnered two Grammy's and it is the reason so many people love to hate Eminem.  He gives it to you with no sugar coating whether you like it or not. Many were content with writing Eminem off as the token white-rapper to come along every two years or so.  But once Eminem started showing up on albums like \\"The Chronic 2001,\\" people realized that this white boy might be hanging around for a little while longer than his light-skinned predecessors.<br />\\"The Marshall Mathers LP\\" lets you dive head first into Eminem's world.  Songs like \\"Criminal\\" and \\"The Real Slim Shady\\" show the lighter, more comical side to Eminem that true hip-hop heads love to hate about him.  However, he gains his street cred on hard-hitting opus's like \\"The Way I Am\\" and \\"Marshall Mathers.\\"  He lets all his critics know that he will change no matter what  on songs like \\"Who Knew\\" and \\"I'm Back,\\" while giving those same critics more \\"ammo\\" from songs like \\"Kim\\" and \\"Kill You.\\"  This album has everything you would look for in a classic album: Comedy, drama, sarcasm and reality.<br />The one track that makes this album worth-while is \\"Stan.\\"  An overzealous fan who takes his fascination with Eminem over the edge will be remembered as the song that gained Eminem some credibility with musicians outside hip-hop.  For an artist who was heavily bashed for being a \\"gay-basher,\\" isn't it odd that an person like Elton John would come to Eminem's defense when dealing with the gay and lesbian community.  I'm sure everyone is tired of hearing about this duet over and over again, but it was truly a critic-silencing moment....especially when Eminem lifted up his favorite fingers at the end of the performance.<br />Many people, however, will never be able to see past his skin color.  They will credit his success to the fact that he appeals to the widest audience possible.  They will not see that underneath the skin, there is an unbelievably talented rapper with skill and charisma to be one of the best in the short, but storied history of hip-hop.  Period.
0440236304|5.0|This book is very good for several reasons, but mostly because Burgett keeps your attention throughout so that you almost feel as if you are his comrade in the war.  He gives a great first hand account of all the action, hardships and general doings of a paratrooper during one of the most prolific and celebrated battles of WWII.  I was so involved in the book that I missed my bus stop - - by 10 stops!<br />The only downside would be that the book is focused on only Normandy, but at [this price], Burgett's the three battle books (Currahee!; Road to Arnem and Seven Roads to Hell) are well worth it!
B000002G9S|5.0|This record is truly sublime.  Any records that achieves this level of depth and esploration to a minimalist setup of spare notes has GOTTA BE GREAT!  Buy it before you die...
B00006RU5B|5.0|One of the best in a long time, I was a bit anxious to see if they could pull it off as I'm a fan of both bands ...... and I have to say this album is excellant.<br />Best track getaway car a beautiful song, just one of many great tracks.<br />Dont listen to my opinion if you want this album, but it's definately worth buying
B00006L7XQ|5.0|When I first bought the LP of &quot;The Man Comes Around&quot;, I was totally amazed, that the cover-versions on this album sound much better than the original versions(e.g. Hurt). Even at the age of 70 he has still the magic to make me believe in what he says...<BR>and sings.<BR> <BR>The last time I saw him in a Larry King interview on CNN and he was just great.<br />I vote for him, because he's my all- time HERO.
B0000630YA|5.0|This is Alice Cooper in all of his glory.  In many ways is this Alice Cooper at the height of his success, stature and musical aplomb.  It's sad that Alice can sometimes be written off as, \\"That's wackjob with the chickens.\\", because this record contains songwriting that equals The Beatles, Billy Joel, Elton John etc.  A 20th Century Great!<br />The opener track, \\"Welcome To My Nightmare\\" begins with a true tip of the hat to Jim Morrison (who Alice apparently hung with for a while) and just builds from there.  \\"Cold Ethyl\\" is a hysterical homage to necrophilia.  But in a funny way.<br />Although this album flat out ROCKS (\\"Escape\\", \\"The Black Widow\\") its theatrical elements should not be taken for granted or overlooked.  Alice had a lot of guts trying to pull of something like this.  The whole disc is sort of like a story about nothing.  It has no real beginning or end.  Kind of like a NIGHTMARE!!!  Wouldn't  you say?<br />Finally, I'm sick of everyone screaming, \\"Led Zeppelin created hard rock and heavy metal.\\" Forget that!  Listen to Alice Cooper and Black Sabbath and you'll figure out who the real trailblazers were!!!  Thanks Alice!
B00005JKZT|5.0|It's amazing, how many people were looking forward to this movie. I showed up at the movie 90 minutes early, tickets bought long before, and there was already a line. There are...how many?...reviews here just judging from the previews. So, there is definitely a lot of enthusiasm about the movie, many people looking forward to it.<br />Could it actually live up to these expectations?<br />The answer is yes.<br />The Two Towers is the best movie of the summer. It's even better than the first one -- and that is no small feat. While remaining true to Tolkien's book, the Two Towers adds new, humorous lines, and shows particular detail on the character of Eowyn. Eowyn, in the book, is barely shown -- she is merely the beautiful Lady of Rohan. Here, in the movie, she matches swords with Aragorn, befriends the remaining members of the Fellowship, and becomes the least passive female in the Lord of the Rings. Galadriel and Arwen don't -do- much...Eowyn of Rohan does more.<br />Instead of dividing the movie in half -- the second half with Sam and Frodo, the first with the rest of the Fellowship -- the movie goes back and forth between the three main groups: Merry and Pippin; Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli; and Frodo, Sam, and Golllum. The least attention is given to Merry and Pippin, the most to Aragorn and company. Frodo and Sam are with the computer-generated Gollum -- who manages to -not- be annoying, in the manner of Harry Potter's Dobby. Gollum actually shows one of the funniest scenes in the movie (yes, the Lord of the Rings is quite funny), in a scene where he talks to himself. However, Gimli also shines in this movie, with many very good moments.<br />The plot centers mostly around Aragorn and his friends aiding the Men of Rohan, in a titanic battle at Helm's Deep. This scene takes up much of The Two Towers, and is brilliantly performed (Gimli, in this part, is wonderful). When it finishes, it gives a sense of an ending to the movie -- this time, there's no cliffhanger ending. A major victory has been won...but the war is still to be completed.<br />The movie ends leaving off the final few chapters of the Two Towers. Shelob is not in this. Yet, surely, in a year, this will be the exciting part of the next movie.<br />Wonderful movie. Highly recommended. Get your tickets -well- in advance.nding.

B00006JJ1O|4.0|I went through hell to get this cd.  And it was worth it.  I bought the single first, and had to wait until December 10th to get the full length one.  The best part of Tatu is that they have a great edge and I like the fact that they are not &quot;Backstreet Boys&quot; Big (In America).  In all honesty I would like to buy some of their previous cds.  I really like the beat and sound that I heard from this cd.  Also they have a great look about them, very real and believable.
B000002WCJ|5.0|I just have no words to describe this album. Its power metal at its best. All songs are very strong, with an awesome guitar work, powerful drums and one of the best singers of all times : Michael Kiske.<BR>The title track is an epic theme of 14 minutes. I garantee you that you will find no power metal song like this one never. A real classic that every headbanger should love and worship.<BR>I strongly recomend this album. If you have a chance buy it. Then buy also &quot;High Live&quot; and compare the version of &quot;Eagle Fly Free&quot; (with Andi Deris on vocals) with the one in this album. It makes you think on why is Helloween doing with such a bad singer in todays lineup...
B00005JKZT|4.0|Im finding it a bit difficult to assess this movie overall after just one viewing, as it felt so distinct from the book. Whereas _Fellowship_ corresponded in a linear manner with the events portrayed in the book, and so felt at once familiar as well as visually new and bracing, the disparate nature of the plot lines in _The Two Towers_ seemed to give the filmmakers a lot of jostling room to monkey with the source material. And while that at times worked during the course of the film, it didnt always feel comfortable to me.<br /> Im pretty sure Ill like it better the second time through, as that was the case with _Fellowship_. Unfortunately, that probably means that given the opportunity of repeated absorbings, the immediacy of the film increasingly supplants the book version that was fresh in my mind (Im wondering how _Fellowship_ the book will seem once Ive gone back and read it; I havent since the movie came out last year). I havent figured how that dichotomy is going to resolve itself over time, or even if it is.<br />Anyway, back to the movie, and some random thoughts about it. As with _Fellowship_, there were numerous instances of attention to detail that I really liked and appreciated, such as Eomers Rohirrim surrounding the Three Hunters in perfect formation, Southrons marching into the Black Gate, Theoden and the simbelmynë flowers on the burial mounds, Herbs and Stewed Rabbit, Oliphaunts, \\"Forth Eorlingas!\\", and many lines of dialogue lifted right from the pages of Tolkien, even Faramirs initial confrontation with Frodo and Sam (although their interaction diverges from the book radically after that).<br />The Arwen/Elrond flashbacks and interludes I thought worked fine, and I didnt mind the whole Warg attack episode either (we didnt get to see the one in _Fellowship_, after all). I heard several weeks in advance about the Elves participation in Helms Deep, and thought \\"thats messed up,\\" but now I dont mind it so much. It makes sense to me now. Unfortunately, the brief scenes with Treebeard and the Ents did not conjure up a scintilla of the sense of enchantment and wonder which the book does for me, but at least theyre there. A few of Treebeards lines are pretty good, though (\\"hooommm, that doesnt make much sense to me but you *are* very *small*\\"), and I did enjoy seeing Isengard getting WORKED! Hah!<br />One tendency I notice in these movies is for certain details or hints in the book to get picked up and made into a *spectacle*, like the wizard-duel in _Fellowship_, and the transformation of Theoden in _The Two Towers_, in which a vague metaphor in the book is played out like nothing so much as an *exorcism* on screen (complete with a view of Sarumans control being physically wrested away). Seemed weird, and perhaps a little excessive. Probably one of those book-to-film things where important subtleties get made really obvious. Oh, well. Thats why we have books.<br />I must confess I was a bit underwhelmed with Helms Deep. One of the many things that really grabbed me about _Fellowship_ was the incredibly *kinetic* way the battle scenes were filmed, of which I had never seen the likes before, and I was expecting to see that same sort of thing on a much larger scale at Helms Deep (all the more because advance reports used all manner of hyperbole like \\"mind-blowing\\" to describe it). And a lot of the hand-to-hand stuff just seemed dizzying and a bit incoherent, although some cool stuff shows up when the camera backs up a bit from the action, like all the Uruk-Hais war machines, and the physical setting of Helms Deep itself, which is certainly impressive. And where Legolass single-screen-shot one-two-three move in _Fellowship_ dropped my jaw to the floor, his little shield-surfing bit here only drew a \\"yeah-sure\\" smirk from me.<br />And now to Gollum. The rendering of his character by Andy Serkis is as finely nuanced as the CGI on the screen is. Jackson and co., to their credit, fully realized how important it was to make Gollum *work*. The truth is, hes not much more fun to be around on screen than he would be in person, and I think the reason for that is that he *does* come across like hes supposed to: a tortured junkie in withdrawal, consumed with insatiable want and loathing. The only potential problem, maybe, was the unintentional(?) laughs Gollum generated in the audience in some key scenes. Wood and Astins performances of Frodo and Sam are adequate, as they were in the first film.<br />Sadly, the perceptive, intuitive, but strong-willed Faramir of the books has been all but replaced, and the guy in the movie trying to pass himself off as Faramir is none too compelling even in the capacity he serves there. I heard that either Philippa Boyens or Fran Walsh said that the Faramir of the books was rather static and wouldnt translate well filmically, and thats as may be, but what they did do with Faramir didnt work so well for me. How will they make him likeable enough in _Return of the King_ that Eowyn will take him?<br />The whole Osgiliath thing where Frodo almost gives the Ring up to the Nazgul, and Faramir is somehow able to discourage it with a single arrow, I didnt buy it. As people have already pointed out, wouldnt Sauron have bent all his resources to capturing the Ring once one of the Nazgul located it? Doesnt make sense to me.<br />In summary, I certainly admire the scope of the effort, the obvious reverence of the filmmakers for the source material, and all the little loving details that do work like theyre supposed to. I think thats all I have to say about it until a second viewingn is. Jackson and co., to their credit, fully realized how important it was to make Gollum *work*.

0553381709|5.0|The prologue sets the tone by laying out the fate of the men of the Night Watch who had gone beyond the Wall. From there Martin quickly reintroduces his characters and his multiple story lines moving from viewpoint character to viewpoint character as the story unfolds.  While the focus of the book is on the political intrigues of the Seven Kingdoms much of the action has shifted to the northern wastes beyond the great wall and the tragic turn of events for the men of the night watch.  A surprise is the use of Samwell as a viewpoint character.  Samwell is the ultimate un-hero, describing himself as fat cowardly and inept he somehow manages to stay not only alive but a player in events north of the wall.   <br />Across the sea with Daenerys Targaryen has emerged as a character and a power to contend with.  She has grown form an abused little girl to a queen in exile.   Her dealings with the slave traders gives insight into her character and offers a growing number of possibilities as to how she, her three dragons  and her now massive army of former slaves will fit into the political struggle going on in the Seven Kingdoms.  <br />The war goes well for the easy to hate Lannisters and poorly for the sympathetic Starks.  Even though he has won every battle he has fought, Robb Stark's position continues to weaken, he literally wins every battle he fights but in process is loosing the war.<br />Mr. Martin is as unflinchingly honest about the brutal reality that forms the heart of the chivalrous world he has created. No characters are safe from death, disfigurement, betrayal or their own mistakes.  Mr. Martin does not save his characters or his readers feelings about these characters by saving them at the last minute from their fates.   The gray morality continues and one is never certain who to root for.<br />\\"A Storm of Swords\\" also expands on the magical aspects of the elaborate world Martin has built.  Magic and the supernatural were quietly hinted at in the first two volumes of the series and are finally coming into play.  Most impressively, Mr. Martin manages to blend in these magical elements without losing any of the gritty realism that has been a hallmark of the series so far.  <br />Like its predecessors, \\"A Storm of Swords\\" is packed with special details, the sights and sounds and smells of life in a retooled Middle Ages setting. It is a complicated and sprawling attempt to portray an entire world and a myriad of events; despite this it never loses sight of the mundane lives of the individual characters.<br />Mr. Martin has promised that this series will continue for six books.  However I am wondering if he can successfully pull that particular rabbit out of the hat.  The sheer number of major plot elements beckon for more space to develop and this does not include the ever expanding number of sub-plots.  Given the stories emphasis on the number seven, seven kingdoms, seven deities and so on, I suspect that there will be a total of seven books in this series.
0066214122|4.0|If the name Michael Crichton is unfamiliar to you, you are not alone. I didn't recognize his name when one of Dave's employees recommended this book to me. Scanning the book jacket made him more familiar to me. His accomplishments include: The Andromeda Strain, Congo, Jurassic Park, and the television show E.R.<br />Prey is a Frankensteinian story about man's messing with nature... like some of the others the author has written. I think that Mary Shelley would approve, and likely enjoy it once brought up to date on our technology, and her ancient warning is still valid... perhaps even more so today than it was when she originally wrote Frankenstein.<br />The story opens with the protagonist taking care of his children while his wife works in a high tech industry. I found much to identify with in that character, so was immediately interested. As I read further, I found other things of interest. Most notably, technophiles will find the inclusion of bits of program code for predator/prey algorithms used with things similar to alife. The mention of a T-shirt that says \\"Obey me, I am Root\\", is hilarious... but only Unix and Linuxphiles will appreciate that humor without reading Mr. Crichton's explanation. One might also recognize one's co-workers by their descriptions... I certainly did, and I don't even work in a high-tech field!<br />Prey is somewhat like a Tom Clancey techno-thriller in that the technology discussed is quite well within the realm of developmental possibility. As I see the picture, the only thing that severely limits the industrial manufacture of molecular level machines is the \\"build time\\" dilemma, the unfortunate (or perhaps fortunate) fact that any useful molecule would have more parts in it than could be assembled in all the time that the universe has existed.<br />The technocrats of Prey solve this problem by getting bacteria to build molecular level assemblers which then build the individual nanotech devices to the specifications of the militarycontract... or so it is thought. Unfortunately, the devices, components of a sort of flying compound eye that can dissolve into dust and re-form as needed, fail because the tiny machines are as much a slave to the wind as any dandelion or cattail seed, and lack power to resist it. I will not divulge the method elected to solve the problem as it would wreck the story for the reader, but it combines all the stupidity and danger that narrow-minded pursuit of even a noble goal can result in. What is unleashed is chillingly reminiscent of a swarm of killer bees... only more dangerous by a factor of at least a million.<br />How close to this eventuality are we? Well, the back of the book contains a lengthy bibliography for those individuals who are brave, smart, and crazy enough to want to find out. I think that this book should be required reading for anyone working in the field of nanotechnology... and those who scoff at the premise ought to be banned from working with it. Any new technology is potentially dangerous... and carried to the levels achieved by the fictitious characters of this book where biotech and nanotech are merged with computer science to build bio-mechanical organisms that can write their own specifications would be beyond control... even had they not taken stupid and dangerous risks.<br />The kiss of death takes on a new meaning in this novel... and I certainly hope that enough people read it and take the message to heart that enthusiastic scientists are reigned in a bit before proceeding. We certainly cannot keep the genie in the bottle forever... but we had damned well better make certain we can control it before we get the corkscrew out!<br />Buy this book. Read it. Loan it to others to read. We have been warned.<br />Dale A. Raby<BR>Editor/Publisher<BR>The Green Bay Web
B00005QZ7U|3.0|You have to admire the lavishness of this production, but the stars never get the chance to shine in this overbloated spectacle.  Luhrmann squandered a great cast in favor of an awesome display of pyrotechnics.  The dialog has been sliced and diced, and the deliveries are little more than sound and fury, as Kidman, McGregor, Broadbent, and Leguizamo strut from one lavish scene to another with no where to go.  God only knows what Luhrmann had in mind, but it has been a downward spiral since &quot;Strictly Ballroom,&quot; by for the most satisfying feature of his &quot;Red Curtain Trilogy.&quot;  Now Luhrman has the audacity to take on &quot;La Boheme.&quot;  Enough Baz!  Get back to the basics.  All movies need a good story.  You left this one chopped up on the dressing room floor.
B000063UR2|2.0|This is Ridley Scott's absolute WORST. I realize that this film has a strong fan following, but I have to say it: this sloppy mess of a movie is just plain horrid. The storyline is so cheesy and insane.  I realize that fantasy movies are supposed to be cheesy, but come on.  The dialogue is excrutiating to listen to.  I cannot recommend this movie to anyone.  The acting, with the possible exception of Tim Curry, is atrocious.<BR>   But it's not ALL bad.  The effects are wonderful, and Ridley Scott's visual style makes this movie very easy on the eyes.  But great special effects don't make a great movie.  If you want to see a great fantasy movie, I would recommend Lord of the Rings instead of this unintelligible mess.  Oh, by the way, I belivieve an earlier reviewer said this was a great movie to show to your children.  DON'T, unless you want them to have nightmares until they're 30.
B000000YG5|5.0|One of the giants of jazz, Sonny may not have been as innovative as Coltrane, but he more than made up for it with his shear force of will.  This is powerful playing from beginning to end.  It is one of the most satisfying jazz recordings ever made.  Sonny has a stellar group behind him giving this recording a fully rounded sound.  Another must have is &quot;Tenor Madness,&quot; the one and only time, Rollins and Coltrane shared the same stage.
B000003TA2|5.0|Sonic Youth have been associated with a bewildering number of styles and movements over their 20 year history and whilst it a near impossible task to pick a favourite album out of their rich and varied oeuvre, `Goo' is probably the best place for the uninitiated to start.<br />  The last of five indispensable albums Sonic Youth released in the late 1980s, they had the good sense to ensure their first release with major label muscle behind it was also their most accessible. Their well-documented tendency toward feedback-drenched experimentation is held in check and forced into coherent 3-minute song structures. <br />But this temporary embrace of rock n' roll conventions is solely on SY's terms and in no way smacks of a sell out (Goo is often unfairly labelled as bubblegum punk by elitist SY fans) yet in it's own way as adventurous and diverse any of its predecessors, the only constant being those expertly de-tuned guitars.  Lyrically and musically all three of the band's songwriters are at the top of their game:  Kim Gordon manages to simultaneously trash the mythologizing of dead musical icons and pay tribute to heroine Karen Carpenter on `Tunic.'  Whilst Thurston Moore displays his long term love of hardcore punk on the abrasive `Mildred Pierce' and the often over looked Lee Ranaldo produces one of the finest songs on this or any Sonic Youth album in the form of `Disappearer.'  <br />Like all great Sonic Youth albums, Goo manages to simultaneously give an immediate pure noise thrill, whilst ceaselessly pushing the boundary of popular music.  By ceaselessly innovating Sonic Youth have changed the face of `alternative' music.  Almost every great band of the past decade is forever in their debt and Goo is the best place to begin finding out why
B00005OAIE|4.0|Okay, so John here sounds a bit like Dave, Radiohead, and Toad the Wet Sprocket.  Oh yeah, and Badly Drawn Boy sounds a bit like Nick Drake. The Rolling Stones out and out stole songs from the old blues greats with out so much as a thank you in the liner notes.  Oh and uh, Mozart was derivative of Bach and Beethoven was derivative of Mozart and the list goes on...<br />People, music is a derivative art.  <br />This is the first thing that I've heard teenagers listening to in a long time that I thought had much artistic merit.  I volunteer with youth and heard some of them listening to this disc.  I borrowed it and was altogether impressed with the general sound and feel of the album.  When I found out the guy's age I immediately thought of Ian Moore.  The album has a nice mellow bluesy feel.  I'll admit that I didn't pay much attention to the lyrics, but on the whole I'd say it was enjoyable..
0679437223|4.0|Catch-22 was written by Joseph Heller who served as an Army Air Force bombardier during WWII, which seems obvious since some of the information described seemed like it could only have come from someone who actually was there and went through the war.<br />Rule Catch-22 seems to be a lose lose situation. You can be discharged from duty during war if you are insane. But Catch-22 points out that only people who are insane would participate in war to begin with, so if you know you should not be participating in it, then you're sane, and thus have to serve.<br />John Yosarian the main character reminds me a lot of Corporal Klinger from M.A.S.H., (I'm sure that that T.V. show had to have used this book as a model, if not intentionally, then at least subconsciously), but unlike Corporal Klinger who is trying to get a section 8 to get out of the war because he's lazy, Yosarian is trying to get a section 8 to get out of the war to save his life. It's not as funny when you put it that way.<br />This book was quite an emotional roller coaster ride. It's full of sarcasm which I like, but it's Joke, Joke, Joke, and then someone dies. When that happens I didn't know whether I was supposed to laugh or cry.<br />Then just when you get used to this type of format it changes to the reverse where it touches upon a really sincere issue, and then hits you with more satire to follow it up.<br />The tension in the book keeps mounting and mounting as the number of missions a bombardier needs to fly to qualify to go home keeps mounting. You find yourself routing for the character just to survive.<br />It's full of lot's of irony, and all of the characters are wonderful. I'm not a psychiatrist, but I'm sure each one of them represents some part of his psyche. Overall it was a very good book.<br />P.S. A movie based on the book came out in 1970.
B00005JKLZ|5.0|When I first heard of this movie, I was very skeptical. Usually remakes are worst than originals. I really like the 1960 version of the movie, and a remake of it seemed spotty at best. I finally caved in and watched it reluctantly. I watched it after star wars II (which was a very poor movie by the way).<br />The time machine is a very well made movie! The changes from the 1960 movie actually made the movie more interesting, and the technological advances (movie wise) are great. Just watching the morlocks run made this movie worthwhile... along with the moon falling apart and Eloi people who seemed much more realistic in the 2002 version than the 1960 version.<br />It made my (all time) top ten list of movies, and is the best movie I have seen in 2002. And to say I expected a dud... wow, how wrong can you get
0887307396|5.0|Collins and Porras's contribution to the business universe can be boiled down to one simple concept:  Companies built around a set of core values and a core purpose have a better understanding of which actions are right and which are wrong for their business.<br />Having a built in compass for decision making is worth a huge amount in increased productivity and internal trust.  If everyone tends to approach decisions from the same viewpoint, results are more consistent and cross-functional buy-in is less difficult to acquire.<br />Now, they take a long time to make this point, and support it with a large amount of research, but how seriously can you take an academic analysis of such a small sample group of companies?  Just as in Good to Great, Collins's other masterpiece, the reader must swallow his skepticism at how the conclusions were reached and marvel at the obvious value of their insight.
B000006YMN|3.0|Agnetha released 3 English language CD's in her post-ABBA singing career. All three releases are decent and have their <BR>highs and lows, but 'I Stand Alone' stands alone (pun intended) as Agnetha's best. Peter Cetera does a great job of producing the album, and in finding a sound that fits Agnetha quite well. Most of the songs are solid, and a few are outstanding. <BR>'I Wasn't the One' should have been a US top ten hit, and wasn't. The title track and 'Let It Shine' are among the best<BR>things Agnetha has done post-ABBA.<br />       Everyone has their own opinion about the post-ABBA work of Agnetha and Frida, but I have felt for quite a while that 'I Stand Alone' is the best of the girl's solo albums. This album<BR>captured a very nice slice of the voice and persona of Agnetha, something that was sadly lacking in both of her previous solo CD's.
B000002TPS|5.0|First off the music on this album is not up to Megadeth's usual standard but the amazing lyrics and vocals make up for it. This is without a doubt Mustaines best vocal perfomance. This album contains some of the best lyrics ever.<br />Who'd believe with the way things are here<BR>We'd be going anywhere telling people<BR>How to live?<BR>Who'd believe we'd spend more<BR>Shippin' drugs and guns<BR>Than to educate our sons?

B000002QWD|5.0|This album brings back all the great and happy childhood memories of Christmas.
0380817683|5.0|This book is absolutely divine.  The plot is strong, it has a wonderful twist of good and bad, the right amount of love and sex, laugh-out-loud humor and a simply remarkable ending!  This is Marian Keyes' best book (Rachel's Holiday is a close second) and one of my all-time favorites!  You'll love it, I promise!!!
B00005JLRR|1.0|I should have known better then to waste my money on A star trek movie. Please note that I am not A star trek fan so do not take my review for what it is. this is A VERY DISAPPOINTING movie because like star trek generations and star trek insurrection there is know great big space battles. star trek nemesis lead up to like it was going to have A big space battle and what happened same thing that always happens in all star trek movies except star trek first contact which is the best star trek movie they have made. The plot of star trek nemesis is nothing new clones new starships its all been done before. All I know is star trek has A lot potential if they would just have more villians like the borg or the jem hader or kahn. these villians you can't talk to them you can't reason with them you fight them. this star trek had some of that but not much. All in all I would NOT AND I ME NOT recommand this movie to any one looking for star wars type space battles. for people turning to star trek looking for big space battles I recommand the following movies. The first one is star trek first contact.<BR>The only star trek movie I bought I own the dvd version. the other star trek movie is the tv movie star trek deep space nine the way of the warrior and star trek voyager scorpion both were two hour specials these movies can be enjoyed by any star wars fan or babylon 5 fan.If you have to see this star trek movie do not go with HIGH HOPES you will only disappoint yourself in the long run. This movie would have been good if they would've had A big space battle. but then again WE ARE talking about star trek.
0613181050|5.0|Never thought I would use the words \\"Romance\\" \\"Suspense\\" \\"Thriller\\" and the History of Mathematics in the same sentence. Great book and worth reading. It is a gripping account of the events leading to the solving of one of the greatest puzzles in Mathematics.
B00003CXDD|5.0|Willow is BY FAR much better then the lord of the rings trilogy.<BR>for one reason it does not drag out in story like the lord of the rings does. As for the plot of willow its a lot like the hobbit. I would recommand this movie to all fans of the lord of the rings and fantasy movies.
0316666343|5.0|I read this book for a outside reading project in school, and I was amazed at how much i liked it. The beginning could be disturbing to some people, but Sebold handles it very well, not becoming too graphic. As a high school student myself, I found that the way Selbold described the lives of this kids seemed like she was a teenager herself. This book really changed how I thought about many things, and I recommend it to everyone. I have lent this book to many friends, who have all loved it, and my parents thought it was wonderful---everyone loves it, and im sure you will too.
074322454X|5.0|Make sure the dogs are fed and the kids are occupied because once you start down the road with the brave men of Easy company you will not put down this book for love or money.  It is by turns heart felt, exciting, and harrowing.  We can never realy know what it was like for those chosen souls to face what they did during the war but after reading &quot;Band of Brothers&quot; at least I know of the great debt we owe these men and their families.  Thanks Guys!
B00005JKED|5.0|I never, ever expected to see Denzel in this light. He was to die for in this role. It is so not him, it's so shocking. Worth the oscar. I hope he keeps me guessing for a long time.
B00005JKZT|5.0|This is \\"storytelling\\" and \\"storyseeing\\" of the highest order. We were all blown away by Part I and left the theater asking how Parts II and III could measure up. Would there be a let down? Was all the budget used up on Part I? (They had to know we would all go see Part II anyway.) Well, Part II answers those questions. If anything, this movie is more satisfying, more detailed and more expensive than the first and the perfect set up for the final part of the Trilogy.<br />The action is intense and unrelenting, making room for digital effects to be a part of almost every scene, but nothing gets in the way of the tale.  The care and detail show up everywhere. When the digital effects start flowing in the battles, focus now and then on the corners of the screen. There are even small subplots of action there.<br />You literally could not have made this movie five years ago--unless you would have settled for a Gollum puppet or some man in a Gollum costume. The poor creature is done just about perfectly and actually looks the best in the close up shots. Here, what I saw on the screen matched the vision that I had as I read the book.<br />Some slight liberties were taken with the storyline, but its not a bad thing in the context of what they faced in making a movie out of such a long book. I do recommend that you again read or watch \\"Fellowship\\" before you go so you can more easily jump into the full storyline and remember all of characters. Be warned that Part II starts with no summary review of the events we saw in last year's film--it just continues.<br />As a small negative, some of the dialog (like that of Treebeard) seemed overly distorted and a little hard to follow. Thus, I missed a few of the jokes. (Yes, parts are funny, even in the midst of battle.) Maybe it was due to where I sat in the theater, maybe it was due to my failing old \\"rock concert\\" ears --but maybe that's just the way Ents talk!<br />Go and enjoy a really great film!
B00004STPT|5.0|This soundtrack should have won the Academy Award for best score, not Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. This score was far more superior and is one of the best I have heard in a long time. The highlights of the score are the mega battle scenes represented in &quot;The Battle&quot; and &quot;Barbarian Horde&quot;, which is the best cue on the entire soundtrack. Here Zimmer uses his synthesizer banks and fuses them with a massive and powerful symphony orchestra. The horns have most of the thematic content along with blasting rhythms and sheer power from the orchestra. Parts of these cues sound like Gustav Holst's &quot;Mars&quot; from &quot;The Planets&quot; which makes sense because Mars was the Roman God of War. The actual main theme is heard in &quot;Earth&quot; and is a mysterious, slightly ominous and sorrowful theme played wonderfully on the cello and trumpet. The orchestral might is featured in several of the other tracks too, including &quot;Patricide&quot;, which is a very dramatic track, &quot;The Might of Rome&quot;, &quot;Slaves to Rome&quot;, &quot;Honor Him&quot;, and &quot;Now We Are Free&quot;. Great choral work is present in the ominous and dark track &quot;Am I Not Merciful?&quot; The vocals by Lisa Gerrard are incredible and truly give the film its heart and soul with her dreamy and moody vocals as in &quot;The Wheat&quot;, &quot;Sorrow&quot;, &quot;The Emperor Is Dead&quot;, &quot;Elysium&quot;, and &quot;Now We Are Free&quot;. Some of the other instruments that are found are guitars and the duduk, which is an ancient Armenian instrument, that is present in &quot;To Zucchabar&quot;. In the end, the result of all of the tracks is breathtaking. The Lyndhurst Orchestra does a phenomenal job in performing the music and it sounds simply outstanding in the film and by itself. A must have soundtrack that everyone should own.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina Aguilera's previous releases were anything but groundbreaking. She did manage to mark the industry, though, with her powerful voice, although her bubblegum-pop sound didn't complement her voice as well as it should have. She had an amazing following regardless.<br />\\"Stripped\\" is her first real album in 3 years. She has managed to hold her fans and basically stall with a Christmas album, a re-release of her self-titled debut in Spanish, and various other small projects. But in 2002, controversy began to surround the first single off of her long-awaited album. \\"Dirrty\\" hit the airwaves and was a hit from the moment it begun--but the video (which was risque but very enjoyable and protrayed the image the song conveyed very well) sparked differences of opinion. Carson Daly coined it as \\"soft-core porn\\" and Parade magazine pointedly called it \\"sick\\". The video was either an ingenious marketing ploy or the result of Christina (oh, excuse me: X-Tina) deciding to shift into adult territory. Probably both.<br />\\"Stripped\\" is simply amazing. Christina seems to dive in headfirst, shrugging off all negative press she may get. It gives her album a strong feel, and strength is what it is all about. The main point of the album was to show how Christina really is: stripped of the gloss of the pop industry, and, underneath it all, she is one amazing singer.<br />Her album shows talent in every word, in every beat. The first major change you may notice: Christina shares credit on most of the songs on the album. This embeds her own, pure emotion into each of the songs. Even the songs she didn't write seem to be more honest than ever before. Those frightened by the \\"Dirrty\\" image need not worry: the rest of the album doesn't reflect that single at all. In fact, there is no repitition on this album whatsoever.<br />Most pop is the definition of repitition these days (prime example: Avril Lavigne), but each track on \\"Stripped\\" is completely, totally, 100% different from the onebefore. Christina shows her vocal gift, changing from her robust, hip-hop \\"Dirrty\\" image to a personal, slower \\"I'm OK\\". She belts out gospel notes on \\"Impossible\\" (composed by Alicia Keys) and \\"Soar\\", an inspirational gospel song. \\"Can't Hold Us Down\\" (featuring Lil' Kim) is a girl-power anthem with an R&B beat which shows a stronger Christina. \\"Fighter\\" is a sizzling, heavy rock song. Christina's voice is as powerful as ever, commanding the electric guitar. \\"Cruz\\" is a song about a personal journey, definitely a highlight, and \\"Beautiful\\" is a trademark ballad. Although Christina didn't compose this song, she sings it almost as if it were an autobiography. \\"Make Over\\" is also one of the standout tracks. The beat is strong, the chrous is phenomenal, and it just builds up as it moves along.<br />All in all, \\"Stripped\\" is one of the most amazing female albums in a long time. Christina blossoms into a beautiful flower with this album, her real personality giving her musical talents much more credit than her previous manufactured facade was. Every song is a joy to listen to. You push the beats, the controversy, and the advertising aside, and you will see what the album is: Christina opening her mouth and screaming: \\"I'm me--love it or leave it, I'm happy with who I am.\\"
0553274503|2.0|This book was alright. It wasnt the best. <br />     It is about a guy who is mentally challenged and get pick to try an experament to make him smarter(well and opperation). He had to take all these tests and mazes before they could do it to see if he was good enought to use. He was. After he got the opperation he thought it wasnt going to work because he thought he wasnt getting smarter. He really was getting smarter everyday. After he got the opperation he started doing more mazes and tests to see how it works. He kept getting smarter and smarter and remembering a lot of things. He could never remember anything. He remembered how they treated him in school and how the people at work treated him because he understands what they mean by all the things they said about him or to him. He never understood all them things before.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|This album was very well thought out, and we certinally waited long enough for it to come out. It was all worth the wait! Now we know what the soul of this music is all about. The girls did an amazing job of singing in English though I know it was hard. If you listen to the lyrics of the songs you will come to realize that they have a deepness and passion to them that American music of the same genre doesn't. It was an amazing acomplishment by two girls from Russia.
B00005JKZT|5.0|I must admit, I was a little skeptical about the second part of the story. I was not sure that Peter Jackson would pull it off and be able to keep people pinned to their seats for yet another 3 hour stint. I was amazed by the film, not only was I pinned to my seat, The events in the movie unfolded at perfect timing and then gripped tight and took you into the action. The tale picks up and explains in full detail, what happened to Gandalf the Gray and twists the action over to Frodo & Samwise and the quest they share to destroy the One Ring. Certain review sites on the net claim that Golem plays a \\"small part\\" in this movie. I felt that he played a bigger role in this film than Gandalf, You really get in depth information about who Golem really is and how the One Ring has twisted his mind as many others in the past. Golem is at constant battle with his two halves and Peter Jackson as well as the CG animators pulled this fully computer animated creature off with flying colors. The battle sequences are \\"Edge of Your Seat\\" action and there are many battles in this installment. There are also new characters in this film which again are pulled off with amazing precision and reality. Weather you are a Lord of The Rings fan or not, you are sure to fully enjoy this 10 star adventure!
B00003CXHJ|1.0|I feel indebted to Hollywood once again. They have put me straight following ridiculously innacurate history lessons suggesting that in fact the British had something to do with WWII.
B00006F83Y|5.0|First off, I personally think this album is great...its probably one of the best i've heard in years, and with rock on the decline, at this rate I might have to wait another 5 or so years to get an album i like so much. Btw...i honestly wouldn't consider this stoner rock, that makes no sense, rock is rock, there are those who toke and listen to rock, and the other 10% who are clean but enjoy the heaviest of rock.
0553274503|4.0|To me flowers for algernon was a very inspiring book. It showed the courage that Charlie Gordon had. It showed how mean people could be to people. Charlie didnt care what people said about him he just held his head up high and went on his way. I feel very bad for Charlie that he had no idea his friends were making fun of them but once he found that he was smart he found that out. If I found out my friend were not my real friends Id be devasted. I feel bad for Charlie to loose his best friend Algernon That was his best friend. I feel bad and sorry for Charlie for all he went through. This book taught me alot because it taught me to treat people with more respect. just because someone is different doesnt mean that they could be treated badly.
B00006C79E|4.0|St Etienne are not as famous as they should be, but they sure have some of the fans they deserve.  Looking over what's already been posted on Amazon, it is striking how many reviewers in different countries deeply appreciate the Etienne method.  <br />After the sublime taste of Good Humor, a top ten album for the 1990s, I think many of us found it hard to fathom Sound of Water in 2000.  It was as much our problem as theirs.  They just went off to another minimalist place that was a bit harder for us to follow.  <br />Sometimes reminiscent of the Tiger Bay sound, Finisterre is a subtle and exciting musical trip.  Completely derivative, absolutely original, rigorously intellectual, effortlessly poppy, all at the same time.  Just your average Etienne album really.<br />If Sound of Water left any doubts, this one stamps them as one of the very greatest bands of the past decade.  They are as contemporary as they were in 1991, when that nostalgic riff from She's the One first captured my heart.  No mean feat when most outstanding bands tend to burn out in their first five years.  <br />Perhaps they remain underrated because of their seeming obsession with the surface of pop iconography, or the apparent superficiality of Sarah Cracknell's photogenic looks, but St Etienne are to be revered as pop savants.  Roll on the return visit to Australia.
0151008116|5.0|This is one of the most powerful novels I have ever read. It begins with a section that builds up the main character flawlessly. Then it shifts to wonderfully written story of survival, exploring almost every angle of human nature in the face of adversity. It delves into relationships in the most interesting of ways, and makes one think twice about their own. The third and final section of the book brings a bit of a twist in the plot; it left me enjoying the book in it's entirity even more. It is one of those feel good books, which I could not put down...<br /><br />Buy this book and prepare to sail away!<br /><br />Relic113
B000000WA4|4.0|This album is just great. It is a mix of Hard Rock, Pop, Ballads<BR>New Wave and more. The lyrics are meaningful and brilliant and it contains no filler at all. The 28 songs are just brilliant and the Smashing Pumpkins are also a great band. They are great musicians and Billy Corgan is a great songwriter. He may not have the best voice but the songwriting makes up for it completely. <br />Many people complain this is not original and there´s nothing new on this album. I may agree on some level but this album is both enjoyable and listenable. They´re not stealing or taking a style from a special one artist or anything like that.<br />The arrangements and the production is great and this album is too. I recomend every one to buy it. Even If you hate rock music you´ll like it. It is that good. The blocket is also nice.
