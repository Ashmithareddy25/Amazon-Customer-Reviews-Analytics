B00005B1W5|5.0|I have this but it is a vhs tape and I only have dvd-cd player so I wanted to replace it since I enjoy Yanni
B00821OX98|5.0|I started watching this and it took a few episodes, but I am absolutely addicted. Need Season 3 now please!
6305313687|5.0|This is a great movie in every way you could want in to be. Disturbing, upsetting, offensive and thought provoking. The acting was incredible, but we knew Edward Norton had  a gift. The product itself was in excellent condition and arrived quickly and without damage to the person I gave it to as a gift.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I love anything Nicholas Sparks writes.  His love stories are truly love stories without the vulgarity so many writers think adds to their stories.  His stories always make me happy and  true loves exists, at least in fiction.
B00006D295|5.0|Came in the mail quickly and in great condition. The DVD was nearly flawless and plays perfectly. I loved this weird, old movie. I remember going to the midnight show as a teenager and watching it now is just too much fun. Its a  classic for a reason.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I thought it started out slow but it picked up and loved the story taking different directions.  I thought Colleen Hoover did a great job.  First book I have read by her.
B000063UR2|2.0|If you loved this movie as seen in the theatre as much as I did as a child, do not buy the ultimate version. It came with only one of the two DVDs that were supposed to be in the sleeve. The 'Ultimate' version includes alot of useless scenes that the editor got paid a ridiculous amount of money to remove. Still a wonderful movie, just stick with the theatrical version. Sometimes 'never-before-seen' footage should remain that way.
B00BESM14U|5.0|One of the best movies I have seen in a long time.  It's a coming of age movie about high school, but very well done and covering issues that most don't touch. It deals with heavy subjects in a way that leaves you joyous and hopeful.  Very much worth seeing.
B000DWMYQ8|5.0|My boys are 2 and 4.  They LOVE this movie, and I have to say, I do enjoy watching it too!  I think the characters are super adorable, funny writing for adult humor, and cute story line!  We watch it a couple times a day, and doesn't get annoying to me, like some children's movies or tv shows tend to do.<br />I highly recommend!
B00C32R64G|5.0|This is one of the best newer bands to come around in a long, long time! The Nameless One, My Body, Cape of Our Hero, and Room 24 is my favorite tracks! Buy and be satisfied.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I thought this drama was going to be about drinking tea and some stuffy boring drama. Boy was I wrong. I love this show. I don't usually like to watch these type of shows, but downton abbey has the right amount of drama without much evil in it.
B005S9EKCW|2.0|I had never really listened to Les Miz but expected at least a few songs that you could whistle on the way out of the movie. No such luck.
B002TXZRRM|5.0|The gentle pace of life in Mma Ramotswi's beloved Botswana is the backdrop for this first novel of the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency series.  This lady detective's common sense, accumulated wisdom, deductive abilities, perseverance and time for bush tea, equip her to establish the agency, and solve crimes both from the insignificant to the scandalous.  Gentle and entertaining, this book showcases McCall Smith's ability to illustrate the profound with the simple.  Recommended reading.
0307352153|5.0|Susan Cain nailed this one.  This is a book that every introvert should read.  The insights and information provided are extremely helpful in day to day situations.  The book is a very easy read, and draws you in with engaging stories, and provides helpful hints to help parents, people in the workforce, teachers, and many more.
B005NPCUC8|2.0|There's a couple songs I remember my parents jammed to, but not the rest of the album. It's pink floyd though (=
B0099Y2YL6|4.0|I can't get enough of the well written and well acted drama! I see new things every time I watch.
B007LB2B3K|5.0|It's one of those albums you can set your music device to and walk away. You'll never want to skip a song.
B00008G8M4|5.0|Terrific movie, although its a little dated. Always enjoy the whole alien vs human thing. If you like light sci fi you can't go wrong
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|This is the first book I have read completely in years. It renews my hope and faith of good in the world
B005LLSZNM|4.0|I LIKE THE SHOW, BUT IT CAN BECOME ADDICTIVE, i've sometimes spend a large portion of the day watching all the episodes
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This book was not as good as the first, but still had you thinking and trying to figure out the next corner. It was a good ending to the trilogy.
B004YESKU0|5.0|Lost my CD's and this was cheapest way to replace my SOAD portion of the collection. Great CD set of one of the greatest bands of all time!
B0076DELIG|5.0|Great read.  Always entertaining to read Harry Bosch's stories.  Once I start a Michael Connelly book, I can't put it down.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this app.......but it reminds me of temple run (how)<br />well it has a key that will save u......temple run has one.....and u do the same thing but with trains.....STILL LOVE IT IF U DONT HAVE IT THEN GET IT NOW!!!!!!!
0199571120|5.0|The \\"Oxford Dictionary of English\\" is great and a must have in my opinion.  If however, you are looking for an American-English dictionary, you actually want the \\"New Oxford American Dictionary\\".  The Oxford Dictionary is the only general dictionary (unless a dictionary is specific to a field such as Medical Terminology, etc.) that I allow my students to quote from in papers and speeches.  I have heard that some people have had problems with the Kindle edition, which I can neither confirm or deny since I do not use Kindle, so you may want to look at some of the one star ratings in particular if you are thinking of getting the Kindle version.
B00AIUUXHC|1.0|Good game, but if you play it a lot & ever upgrade your device, or have a replacement device due to an insurance claim, then you're out of luck saving your progress and anything you've purchased. If you do figure out how to transfer your data file over to a new device (hint rename after transfer), you'll see the following message, but you will not see this mentioned anywhere when installing the game:<br /><br />\\"Load Game Error\\"<br />\\"The save game file is either corrupt or has been transferred from another device. Transferring save game files between devices is not supported.\\"<br /><br />Thanks a lot!!!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I've been using my cellphone alarm for so long...I like this one much better &amp; I like using it as a night light also &amp; easy to use...I like that
B00822KWME|5.0|i was looking for this<br /> i'm glad you had it.<br />so great, totally enjoying it.<br /><br />great price, thanks for great service
B0083Z614S|4.0|Very good. It would be a great book for children. It makes you childhood and the good times you can have as a child.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I got this for my kindle.  The multiple alarm feature is awesome.  I am always on my kindle so having an alarm to tell me it's time to put down the kindle and go to work is valuable.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I don't like it because it is stupid and I can't find the word streaker for my homework I hate you amazon
0062014536|5.0|YA has become a guilty pleasure for me, I feel a little guilty reading it since I'm so far away from being the target market.  The issue I've had with most YA books is how simplistic some of it is, obviously life isn't that neat or easy.  I read Ally Condies Matched series and it was a disappointment, I couldn't even finish the last one, the characters just seemed simple and not very complex.<br /><br />The Delerium series, on the other hand, I enjoyed very much.  While I think it's premise is a bit implausible, I was able to look past it.  Lauren Oliver's writing is beautiful and the main characters were fleshed out well.  I have seen a lot of people complain about the ending of Requiem and while I understand why some people would want the series' conclusion wrapped up in a bow, Oliver's ending seemed right to me.  Wars don't end in one battle, people dont love one person for their entire life.  It's simple to have Lena say &#34;I love you forever, no one else matters&#34; and have her run away with her man in the sunset but life doesn't work out that way.  And while some here complain that the triangle wasn't resolved, it is quite clear who Lena chooses, even though it pains her to know that the other part of the triangle will be hurt in the process.  And I do appreciate that Olivier doesn't set up another girl for the boy who Lena doesn't choose.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I really like the game as you can build a lot of different buildings and services but they should give you a daily bonus
B00001OH7P|4.0|I also appreciate that this CD cover and the CD arrived in excellent condition with no damage.  I like the music on this album.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I love this game at the local fair and this is just like it. Wish we could start with more coins as it takes awhile to score more love the prizes too.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|This is my first album of Adele's music and I love all the songs on this album.  She reminds me of Peggy Lee's jazzy singing style!<br /><br />I was disappointed that the album cover arrived crushed, but the CD was not damaged at arrival.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really think this game rides! Lol. But really if u haven't gotten this game yet your crAzay! So that means get it!!!!!!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My daughter loves playing this game.  I have enjoyed it, too.  Why do i have to have so many words?
B0041KBWM0|5.0|I liked this version very much.  I thought it was just the right length.  I would certainly watch it again.
B005HSL626|5.0|My daughter loves playing this game.  I have enjoyed it, too.  Why do i have to have so many words?
B006LSZECO|5.0|Excellent character depictions- each came alive on the pages as each heart pounding situation unfolded.  Loved it!  The suspense made it impossible to stop reading.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|OK I waited, and then waited some more and I had a few co workers tell me \\"you have to read this book\\". So, I decided what the heck, I love to read......Ehhhhh it was OK. I thought it was going to be more, more what not sure, but with all the hype over the book, I was expecting ALOT! It was OK.
B004TUKNX6|5.0|Loved it when it first hit the stores way back when. Love it just as much now!<br />5 Stars all the way
6305692572|4.0|This is a serious movie and not the type I would normally buy, but the acting is good, the story line can be followed and the price is right.<br /><br />This is a fictional study of substance abuse and what it does to individuals and relationships.  I personally enjoyed the movie.  Will I watch it a second time?  Probably not.  Will I recommend it to friends?  Yes.  It is a rather long movie and once you begin it you will not want to stop or pause it until the end.  If you like happy movies stay away from this.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|It was an easy read and I couldn't put it down but it still left me kind of wanting as I had hoped that the father would gain some understanding of his mentally ill son............
B003O86FMW|5.0|Reading this again before the movie comes out :).  I  rarely read a book more than twice, but this book is an exception!
1402270275|5.0|I'm not sure if I can find enough superlatives to express my delight and admiration for this wonderful story.  I love steampunk and alternate histories, and this story was all that as well as a very interesting take on the vampire mythos.  There was action, mystery, intrigue, and an intense and touching romance, as well as some intriguing surprises, all set in a London that was gritty, dark and dangerous.  Blade is such an exceptional hero; a rogue blue blood with a dark, tortured past, he's made a group of misfits into a family.  Honoria has been living a hand to mouth existence, hiding from an aristocratic blue blood that has put a price on her head.  Once Blade and Honoria learn to trust each other, they'll find that working together, they can solve any problem.  And she, as well as her brother and sister, will become part of the little family group, which is just what they need.  I have a new author to add to my favorites list and I would definitely recommend this story to anyone interested in a fantastic and engrossing read.  I'm going to be eagerly waiting for future books in this series.
B0096HIEE2|5.0|Oh yes baby I would recommend!<br />I would recommend this video to any woman or man if that is his preference. It is awesome. Great for a bachelorette movie, Great for women over 21, not recommended for children under 18. A lot of adult content. I would recommend this movie TO ANYONE. I have watched it several times and I am not going to stop. lol. Also, The actors in this are HOT!
B00BF11STU|3.0|Zero Dark Thirty  focuses too much on one character (Jennifer Chastain’s) and not enough on telling a cohesive and understandable story.
B009VSW15Y|1.0|It is okay, but anything in writting will be reversed image in your pictures and video . It was a shame My Churches Christmas' Play was ruined in the video because all signs are reversed.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Dr. Alexander has done what millions of spiritually-inclined and metaphysically oriented people have been trying to do for so long: prove there is another dimension, another realm, where our souls go after death of the body, and he does it beautifully. A fabulous story, told by someone who knows how to write details. A neurosurgeon of the highest reputation, his medical and scientific descriptions were a little more than I could deal with, but necessary, nonetheless. That is his credibility, someone who did not believe, would not even consider there was anything but 3D Earth until he found himself in the beyond. I read it in one sitting and I loved it, and greatly admire him for having the fortitude to chronicle his journey so completely and without fear. Buy it right now!
0718178122|5.0|Don is a professor of genetics but he also has Asperger's and OCD.  He has never had more than one date so he decides he will compile a questionnaire to try and weed out the woman who are completely unsuitable to be his life's companion.  His life is regimented - he has the same menu for each week and does the same things each day.  But he is capable of deviating from his routine where it seems to him to be necessary to do so.  He struggles to understand the nuances of social behaviour but he does make an effort to do so as he understands his own condition and that his brain is wired differently from other people's brains.<br /><br />Don's attempts at speed dating and organised dinners do not meet with great success but then Rosie Jarman turns up and he is never quite sure how or why she is there but assumes she is someone who filled in his questionnaire. Their relationship, to the reader, seems doomed at first but Rosie wants to find out who her real father is and Don being a geneticist can help by testing DNA samples. The story, told by Don, of what happens then makes entertaining, amusing and at times poignant reading.<br /><br />I thought the characters were well drawn and I liked Don and Rosie and wanted things to work out for them.  Don came over as a very kind person who was always willing to help people even if trying to do so landed him in more trouble because he didn't fully understand the situation. I thought the author portrayed the difficulties of having a rational approach to everything when most people you know pay more attention to their emotions extremely well.<br /><br />If you enjoyed books such as [[ASIN:1612184103 600 Hours of Edward]] or [[ASIN:1400032717 The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time]]then you will enjoy this book.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|This has quickly become one of my favorite guilty pleasures.  It's a unique twist on Pride and Prejudice and is done very well! The cast is great as is the humor. Totally recommend for any Austen fan.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|good app-4 a great $ u get to ride and the horses don't look fake ir anything!! good app its really fun :-)
1594630844|4.0|I enjoyed the variety of interviews and lives discussed.  Great sections on major life topics.  Makes one ponder and meditate on your own path.  Pithy and memorable.
0765325950|5.0|I have not finished the book yet but I am a huge fan of the series. Even though the it had to come to an end.
B0094KT9Y0|5.0|My two year old is in love with the toy story movies.  He especially loves Toy Story 3, with the daycare and Lotso the bear.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|Compelling and heart warming. Rodriguez the musician never got his due in the U.S. Rodriguez the person seems to have everything he ever wanted. A must see.
0812550706|1.0|I'm one of the minority who can't figure out why this book is so popular.  Of course, I'm sure it's a matter of taste, but I have my reasons for not liking it.  Aside from the story being set in outer space, some aliens that really only make an appearance in the end, and some quote unquote training in zero g that didn't seem to have much of a point to it, there was barely anything sci-fi about it. The technologies mentioned weren't anything new.<br /> Having a kid as the main character is the worst part. The child characters are totally unrealistic and Card was trying too hard to make Ender a sympathetic character which didn't make me feel sympathetic to him all. It makes me think that Card was too lazy to pull off a realistic adult military genius and decided to make do with a child character. I spent the last part of the book just waiting for the ending, which was completely predictable. Overall, it was not worth the time it took to read it. I am not a Card fan.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|This book is fantastic it really shows you that no matter how something seems so strange there is usually a good explanation and will soon become clear in time
B00C32REYI|5.0|After playing this on repeat approximately 15 times, I'd have to say I have yet to tire of it. Blake can construct a song that sounds way beyond his years and I feel he is going to be huge. I recommend buying this on vinyl and turning up the bass.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|My only objection is the cost of the power-ups.  Before you know it you can sustain a pretty big charge bill.  Otherwise, it is lots of fun.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have had this ap a few months and its awesome. It works great on my kindle fire and its my go to ap for road trips.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|These games are layed out to be lots of fun.  Once again, the power-ups are too costly for my taste.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Had me laughing, crying, and everything in between.  Amazing graphics and story.  Would definitely recommend this movie to anyone! :)
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|Game is in a continuous download loop.  I have uninstalled it from my Kindle Fire, removed it from my Amazon account. and tried to download it again and again.  It just does not work.  Not worth the hassle.  Don't waste your time.
B001V7YJMG|5.0|Dream like and peaceful.  interesting foreign take on the horror genre.  thought provoking and i am out of more descriptions
B000FA675C|4.0|I find Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code a great conspiracy story. He leaves enough mystery about his characters to make you want to know more and you are never quite sure who is a good guy and who is a bad guy. His prose has a bit to be desired, however the book is an easy read and has a great subject matter.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I like this better than the other one I had. it is louder and more efficient. I hope it stays that way. I use this app all the time.
B008JMKN4Y|1.0|Worst book I have ever read! Stupid and a bad example for youth- I wish I had not bought it.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Usually, I don't really go for the very huge, very long,epic musicals - but decided I'd give this one a try. Found out I loved it. All the actors did an extraordinary job (I didn't know that some of them could even sing that well). This movie really depicts the extraordinary struggle to survive in terrible times and situations. It is a very sad movie, but the true bravery of the characters won me over - besides most of them I found to be very likeable and you want so much for them to survive.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this is just like all the others. they make you have energy and it's almost impossible to make the energy bar bigger. and you have to start out with like 16 energy points,everything you do cost energy points, not very good to constantly play unless you have money to waste.
B009AMANBA|4.0|This is a great historical movie. Daniel Day-Lewis did superb acting (along with the other actors). I always wanted to know more about President Lincoln and the Civil War - so I definitely wanted to see this movie. I did learn some new things, and I thought the movie was well worth watching.
B000005RQT|4.0|This has always been one of my favorite albums, back when there were albums.  This was a good price and an easy deal.
B008220DGE|3.0|This was a good movie, but I rated it just okay. The actors really are great - but the main characters are so very unlikable. It does give you an insight into how things are run in a cult type situation - also one of the main characters is an alcoholic. It is an interesting movie, but also can be very depressing.
B00992CF6W|4.0|It's a really good game and if you like to build stuff this game is perfect game for you.It needs mine carts buckets portals maps and emeralds.
B005LAIIHG|4.0|This movie is really a visual masterpiece - for which they won awards. The movie is mostly about the boy, his brave struggle to survive the shipwreck, stranded on a lifeboat with a ferocious tiger. I think a lot of the movie shows the way your mind could work in such a life-threatening situation also (hallucinations) - but I don't want to give the ending away.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|It is an excellent movie.  It is similar to Lord of the Rings and Narnia.  I am not talking about movie.  It is about morals, Christian movie without see churches, crosses, faith, anything like that.
B00C7QDDJA|4.0|When I saw the previews, I wasn't sure I was going to like it - in fact, I was prepared not to. Lucy Liu has been starring in a string of flops over the last decade so seeing her in this did not seem to bode well for the success of the show. And, to be honest, I don't really feel that she adds all that much substance, diversity or interest to the show at all. Still - I have to admit that it's much better than I thought it would be. Aiden Quinn as the police captain is well-placed, and Angelina Jolie's long-ago ex-husband, Johnny Lee Miller, does a superb job as the erratic recovering drug addict genius and jack of all trades, Sherlock Holmes.<br /><br />All in all, the modern transition went quite well in this one.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|This ibook was written about a time and place that we are all glad we didn't live in or at. These things happened to way to many people years ago and are still happening if you look at the news from around the world we are just lucky we don't have to live there. I found this book compelling and at the same time want to close it and refuse to accept this did indeed happen to so many people. Great story. I also loved the movie with Hugh Jackman.
B000SLP4SE|5.0|I'm old enough to remember Mark Wahlberg when HE was younger and prancing around in Calvin Klein underwear and his brief singing/rapping \\"career\\", so when he first started appearing on the big screen, I found it kind of hard to take him seriously. But he has proven to be a very capable, gifted actor - and this movie shows him as skilled as they come.<br /><br />The story itself is as gripping and fascinating as it makes your blood boil at the injustice and insanity of some parts of it. MW remains a believable character throughout the entire movie - even the parts that seem a little over the top.<br /><br />Great movie.
B001F0VHEM|5.0|Some sad breakup songs with great lyrics.Love the lyrics of &#34;So what&#34; and bad influence.They make you feel upbeat with their catchy lyrics
B00AECGQF2|3.0|looks so much money!  I want it but$.  so many people said it stunk /it did not download it was ugly idk
B008J34466|2.0|Some of the songs sound too angry and some of the song lyrics are not very catchy. I was disappointed with this CD because I couldn't really relate to the song lyrics and none of them made me chuckle like &#34;Bad influence&#34; or &#34;Funhouse&#34; Songs on this CD sounded forced and not heartfelt
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The only think bad I have to say about this series is that I hate that there aren't anymore. Spectacularly written by Suzanne Collins. Katniss' emotions seem so real and pure.
B001GM28HO|5.0|I like all the songs and the beats,alot of great dance songs.All in all just fun to listen to upbeat
B0090P98Z4|4.0|The game has great graphics. The controls are easy to use. The game wants you to spend real money to gear and level up faster so be careful. This is a great game for the price.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|had the game for only two days and fell in love with it. I take a break from schoolwork to play the app and calm my nerves and what do find????? the app wont work properly! kicks me out after a few seconds. so much for my nerves! now I'm irritated. giving the creators a few days to fix before I delete.
B00C32R64G|5.0|I started listening to Volbeat back in 2008 when they released their album \\"Guitar Gangsters & Cadillac Blood\\" with the song \\"Still Counting\\" (an awesome album).Since then I have been hooked to this band. Their latest release \\"Outlaw Gentlemen & Shady Ladies\\" is a great album! I like there cover song \\"My Body\\" which is still a great song from Young the Giant. I have not found a Volbeat album I did not like.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|I enjoy watching it, but you have to get over the liberties they take with the field of law. Like the dynamics of the characters.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love this game. Very relaxing; I play every chance I get. This is a must play before bed and before work.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I love this game its my favorite however on toca boca tailor on my friends ipod its really fun wish they would get toca boca tailor on the kindle. I cant wait till they get it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B006G4F8OW|5.0|Luffy, the captain of the Strawhat Pirates, is shown in his most famous pose of welcoming new adventures into the New World. This &#34;official&#34; figure is marked with the Toei and Funimation stickers on the package. It does not have any articulation being a Zero figure. The sculpt is magnificent to view and the paint application is spot on from the scar on his chest to the etchings in his toe nails. No accessories come with the figure but also includes a base with Luffy's jolly roger printed on it. This is a great collector's item for One Piece fans and figure collectors alike. It is very reasonably priced through Amazon and a great start to any One Piece collection.
B0015442YU|4.0|Another interesting component of the trilogy, even though I had seen this before, I certainly wanted to watch it again.
0307346617|5.0|If you threw this to someone int he past and said &#34;this really will happen&#34;, they would probably believe you since it FEELS so realistic.
0345525558|5.0|\\"The Language of Flowers\\" by Vanessa Diffenbaugh sat on my shelf for several months before I picked it up to read it.  That was a mistake.  The story of Victoria Jones is an unforgettable one, and her love for flowers and their Victorian-era meanings not only saves her hardened heart, but fascinated and tugged on my own heartstrings.  It is a wonderful story of love, redemption, forgiveness, and life in the foster-care system and most of all, the kindness of strangers' hearts.<br /><br />Victoria was abandoned at birth and spent most of the first eighteen years of her life in foster care and group homes.  She was angry, defiant, mouthy, had no plans or direction to her life when she reached her eighteenth birthday and had to leave the system.  Victoria had never experieced being loved by a mother or father in her formative years, so she had no idea how it felt to be cherished and no clue how to love anyone else.  She only loved flowers and the meanings assigned to them long ago.<br /><br />It is through her gift of love for flowers that she creates beautiful and wondrous things for people according to the meanings of the flowers that match peoples' wishes, feelings, and desires that Victoria starts to link the meanings of flowers to her own feelings and her heart.  She discovers that she is exceptionally good at listening to what others tell her about their lives and matching up flowers that have positive meanings for their bouquets, wedding flowers and arrangements in a floral shop where the owner has allowed her to work for a few hours a week.  When she meets a stranger in the flower market, they begin to exchange flowers instead of notes to express their feelings, but she isn't used to doing feelings.  Victoria has a terrible secret in her past that she will one day have to reveal, and she will need strength and forgiveness to tell it and little does she know to whom it is linked.<br /><br />The story goes back and forth from a ten-year-old Victoria to the present day, but it does not confuse. Instead, it helps the reader to understand why the adult Victoria behaves the way she does.  This character is fascinating, heartbreaking and one that begs cheering on as the book moves through its story of this girl's life.<br /><br />The topic of forgiveness looms large in \\"The Language of Flowers\\" and there is much for the reader to learn from this lovely book, and also a lot to learn about the meaning of flowers.  I enjoyed its steady movement and its well-written and obviously highly researched information about flowers.  A book to savor and a character not to forget.<br /><br />Highly recommended with the warning that you'll want to either visit the florist or start planting flowers as soon as you finish the book.
159448385X|5.0|I loved Khaled Hosseini's first book, The Kite Runner, which I read in 2005, a couple of years after it came out. It was so good that I looked forward to seeing the 2007 film of this book, which I enjoyed too. Hosseini's first book reminded me of one of my favorite books, The Four Feathers, written by A.E.W. Mason in 1902. Mason's book was about a young coward who dishonored himself by quitting from the army on the same day he received word that his unit was going to be shipped out to suppress the rising of the Arabi Pasha in Egypt. Throughout Mason's book, the young coward redeemed himself through several acts of physical courage in combat. In a similar story, Hosseini's main character in his first book was a young boy who later spent his adulthood atoning for his cowardice act of betrayal.<br /><br />The author's second book, A Thousand Splendid Suns, did not disappoint me. Although his first book involved relations between fathers and sons, along with that between male friends, his second book involved relations between mothers and daughters, along with that between female friends. Both of these books were set during the violent environment in Afghanistan under the brutality of the Taliban. Hosseini brings credibility to his books based upon his first-hand knowledge and experience from his youth, since he was born and raised in Kabul, the capital and largest city in Afghanistan.<br /><br />The story in this second book involves abusive marriages and an oppressive government, as seen through the suffering eyes of two Afghan women being oppressed by society and their families. Although this book is set in the war-torn and women repressive environment of Afghanistan, women in the Western societies today, including America, have experienced human suffering, domestic violence, and their harsh, sometimes failing, attempts to control their own lives. This, despite that fact that in the last hundred years, women have received the right to vote in America, been elected to Congress, held senior level Government positions, and served as CEOs of Fortune 100 companies. Yet, the Afghan culture is one that continues to treat women as objects. In my opinion, though, male and female dictate biological functions, not human worth or divine value.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book as it will open your hearts in a loving way. Columbia Pictures owns the movie rights and indicated that a film of this book should be out by 2015 - I eagerly look forward to watching the film. I can't wait to read the author's third book,  And the Mountains Echoed, due to be released in May 2013.Congress, held senior level Government positions, and served as CEOs of Fortune 100 companies.

B0064MPXFA|5.0|My husband & I have really enjoyed watching The Mentalist on Sunday nights & noticed that The Good Wife precedes that program.  I wanted to see The Good Wife, beginning with season 1 & was delighted to see that Amazon Prime offers the earlier seasons.  I'm midway through season 1 & am hooked on this show!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I am going to re-purpose this book by making it a Halloween costume. I'll make the pages into a dress and go as a Hot Mess.
030758836X|5.0|Very few books impress me. I'm not a book snob, but most stuff seems recycled or poorly done. This one was like the clouds parting, sparrows singing, unicorns leaping...<br />Basically, I enjoyed it. Tons.
B0050R0YB8|5.0|This thing is SO awesome. We have multiple large Lego star wars ships and this one is the one we display in the living room on its stand. I took my husband and I 3 days to put it together only because it was monotonous and we got tired of looking at all the grey pieces in front of us(there are a lot of freaking grey pieces). It seems sturdy, we moved it a couple of times without it smashing into a thousand lego pieces...but I wouldn't go running around the house playing Epic Battle of the Rebellion with it or anything.<br />Its worth the price. I want another one.<br />One small downside- It needs more lego minifigures. I mean, our Lego Death Star came with like 20 minifigures and this one came with like 4. Lame. Not lame enough to knock a star off the rating, but still, lame.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is so addicting great for kids and adults. My mom plays it I love the speed and the fact that everyplace is a different scene. OMGGGGGGGGGahhhhhh
B002EEP3NO|5.0|I got this for my son for his 7th birthday. He spent about 30 minutes with me assembling the minifigures(Which are all totally rad...I mean COME ON. Imperial Guards!!!), and then said  &#34;Mom you got this&#34; and took off. I spent a day and a half putting it together and none of it was boring or monotonous like the Lego Super Star Destroyer was.<br />Its so epic I cannot even begin to describe its epicness...except that its freaking EPIC. And I am not one who uses the term &#34;epic&#34;. Its hipster and overused.<br />Answer yourself this:<br />Are you a Star Wars fan? Apparently you are if you are checking out this awesome piece of awesome.<br />Do you not love the armed and fully operational battle station?? Of course you do. I mean look at it. Its NO MOON...its a freaking Weapon of Mass Destruction that makes those ones we were looking for years ago look like pick up sticks.<br />Do yourself a favor- buy this. And when you do, glue down the little green laser things. They fall off like no ones business and can be frustrating.<br />Also- Don't drop it.

B005IZLPKQ|5.0|awesome service-received on time and product description was as received. enjoyed the product very much and cover was packaged properly.
1439152799|2.0|As others have mentioned, I wanted to like the story but there was no umph, nothing to keep me going. I would actually fall asleep constantly because it was all just filler. Morton is great with words, I'll give her that, but the story was so mundane. There would be a page long description of something that could have been vividly described in one paragraph. Everytime I thought something might happen, or something might be explained, it would just turn around and become boring again. It really wasn't my cup of tea.

0896898288|5.0|I just received my copy of \\"The Farmer's Wife Sampler Quilt\\". Being a little apprehensive after reading some of the reviews before ordering, I decided that I would sit down and peruse the book just to see what, if any flaws I could see.  First of all, there were quite a few previous reviewers who were confused as to the finished size of the quilt blocks. Page 13 under \\"The Blocks\\" it says that the finished blocks are 6\\" x 6\\".  There are also instructions on the CD that came with the book, that specifically tells you that you need to make sure your printer is set correctly so that your blocks, when finished, measure the correct size. The author tells you exactly what you need to do. My printer automatically set the templates to \\"Fit to Page\\" so I had to adjust the setting before printing to \\"Actual Size\\" or \\"100%\\". It was very easy to do, a click of a button, and I am not a \\"techie\\". I recommend that before you begin you read the beginning of the book, and read the information on the PDF on the CD. There are instructions that you have access to, and that need to be used, to enjoy this book. Toward the back of the book, each block, which has been assigned a number, is listed with block assembly layouts. All very self-explanatory,and quite simple to do, \\"IF\\" you have had some basic quilting experience. If you are a first time quilter, this is not a how to book. Start with something else to learn the art of quilting, or use this book in tandem with a class, etc. where you might get help if you get stuck and frustrated. The only flaw that I could see, if one might consider it a flaw, is that is does take a bit of time to go \\"gather\\" each template for each block. I think that there might have been an easier way to have done this, not sure what that would have been, but it doesn't bother me. I looked quickly through each block to see which block had the most templates, and there was one that I saw that had 11 templates. If it is going to bother you to download 11 templatesto put together a block, then don't get this book. It's supposed to be fun! I love this book already and am going to savor reading each and every page, quilting two of each block as I read them. By the time I finish, I should have enough for a good sized quilt or several quilts!

B00B2TUKI0|5.0|Ms. Peyroux, perhaps the most definitive female vocalist of our age, takes on the classic soul of Ray Charles with a combustible effect. If only Ray were here to sing with her! What a classic soul duet that would make! The not so subtle lilt of Madeleine's distinctive voice ads a feminine mystique to these gems and consequently a completely new meaning to many of the lyrics. Like all her previous work, The Blue Room frequently sends chills down my neck. Of all modern singers Madeleine Peyroux reaches deepest into the past to find her inspiration. No one else can sing modern soul like she can. Along with the songs of Ray Charles there are songs here from Buddy Holly, John Hartford, Randy Newman, Leonard Cohen, and Warren Zevon which I'm used to hearing from male artists. Peyroux offers an ultra sexy spin on them literally revitalizing these classic numbers. I never miss a record by Madeleine Peyroux and I sure wouldn't miss this one.

0307269752|4.0|if I hadn't seen the movie I probably wouldn't have finished the book. The book was very slow starting and I generally wouldn't have the patience to continue. However having seen the movie I knew the story would unfold and well worth my effort. Lizbeth Salander is a fascinating heroine and once she enters the story it becomes all consuming and a difficult book to put down.
0765325950|3.0|Overall the \\"Wheel of Time\\" series was awesome. This ending drove me nuts though. Rand was crippled in this addition and although his ultimate fate was acceptable it left me with this analogy. Someone cooked and ate your prize winning poodle but as compensation the person who ate it offered up what came out the other end to replace it. Yuck! The fact that everyone's contributions were exposed was mastery at work in the storyline. On the other hand torturing our heroes to death was more than I could take at times. I had to set the book aside for a while before I could continue. It is good that people write stories about war that reflect the true cost of war but those books belong in the non-fiction section. We really needed these guys to be more successful and punish the shadow for even existing but instead the hero's were incompetent and luck won the day (and Luc almost did)in this conclusion. i.e. Putting the \\"Horn of Valere\\" in the hands of someone who could not defend it. We know that conflict must exist in order to perpetuate life but evil is optional. (see ying and yang) Looking on the bright side is my forte but this was too much. Moraine should have been included in the final jumping back and forth story telling going on here (that also drove me nuts) but she was forgotten and that fact cost at least one star in the assessment. In the end I have to say thanks for at least finishing the series, I hope Mr. Jordan can rest in peace.
0525478817|3.0|There is love, then there is LOVE. What appeared to me as LOVE when I was a teenager was a complete sacrifice of everything I had to the one I loved. This is something that I didn't find in this book, and it made me sad, because it is absolutely beautifully written, but that pain that pierced me when I was 16? I didn't feel it. Two teenagers who have cancer fall in love, and I kept waiting for it to turn into LOVE, but it didn't. For me. So don't listen to me and read it for yourself, it seems to be a very popular book right now. As for me... if you're curious to read why I gave it only 3 stars, proceed with caution.<br /><br />Hazel, a 16 year old teenager, meets Augustus, another teenager, at a cancer support group meeting, and what ensues is a remarkably well written sharp exchange of smart adolescent pun, sarcasm, attempts at understanding the infinity, the universe, and how it all can possibly fit into the picture of life. Life of someone who has cancer. It can't. It won't. But they still live it and manage to make the best of it, through friendship, through reading each other's books, playing computer games and the like, the typical teenage stuff. That is, they try to make it typical, because it simply can't be. Not when you have cancer. And here is where I have nothing else to say, because as much as I tried, I couldn't relate to the characters beyond a simple observation. I didn't cry over it like I cried over THE PERKS OF BEING A WALLFLOWER. I didn't believe it. The parents were all supportive, too good to be true. Everyone, in fact, was so very supportive, that it had a bit of an aftertaste of... \\"I don't know, I'm trying to , but I'm not buying it.\\"<br /><br />There. Still. Read it. I bet you'll like it. But it was definitely not my book. I'd rather stick my nose back into CARRIE.
B00006DEFA|5.0|As one who enjoys historical fiction in books, I enjoy it even more in movies. Knowing little about classical works or musicians, I find that books and movies come closer to the reality of the history than just the historical 'facts' that only give dates, names, places, but leave out characteristics, events surrounding the people involved, and the cultures from which they come. While books and movies are more subjective, I like to believe that they are closer to the reality of the history than just a set of names, places, dates.<br />K.B.

It really changed how I define &#34;selling.&#34;  I read this book for a company book club, and as we are a business-to-business marketing company, it sparked a lot of insightful and interesting conversations at our meeting.  Plus, we were able to have Dan Pink himself call in!  It was great to hear him talk through some points with us and go into more detail on a few topics.  He's a great guy--very funny!!  We were all delighted to talk to him and we all enjoyed the book.

B00BXZ1G5Y|4.0|For those who have been following the recordings and performances of Icelandic composer and artist &Oacute;lafur Arnalds ths new recording will bring some surprises. Though only 26 years old &Oacute;lafur Arnalds is a multi-instrumentalist, composer, and producer who started as a drummer for a series of metal bands in his native Iceland. His entry into the neo-classical field was somewhat accidental. Now in this new set of works he is joined by the talents of classically oriented composer Nico Muhly and vocalist Arn&oacute;r Dan Arnarson and the result is an orchestration of Arnalds `music that is mind expanding and very atmospheric and moody.<br /><br />Critic Matt Cibula has phrased it best and it is only fitting to quote him here: `First, become afflicted. Unclench your well-lined fists, open the door in the brick wall that surrounds your heart. Let the sadness of modern life wash over you like a waterfall, like a cold shower, like a breakup, a breakdown, a breakthrough. It takes a lot of control to keep it together in these times, and a lot of self-discipline to keep that control together. Just let it go; not all the way, because that way madness lies; just for a few minutes. Secondly, put on your best walking boots and go outside. The air is still a little chilly up here, especially in the mornings, although it's probably better wherever you are, but it's full of spring, of renewal, even hope: Easter, Passover, Spring Break, Opening Day. Let the sun hit you in the eyes so you have to squint; let the soft rain moisten your hair; see the rabbits and the sanitation workers do their early-morning jobs. Shops are opening, school buses are warming up, but the machine is not fully operational yet. Thirdly, allow yourself to truly feel this record. Don't worry about what kind of music &Oacute;lafur Arnalds makes. It's pop, but it's not; it's classical, but it's also electronic; it's jazz and it's rock and it's ambient and it's none of these things and all of them. Categories melt, boundaries are clearly meaningless. In the right light, that will be okay.'<br /><br />Few could phrase it better. This is new music and it invites appreciation.

B009RWRIKM|4.0|It is difficult to capture the ephemeral beauty of dance  but this film by Wim Wenders does a good job to provide an overview of the work of Pina Bausch, with Jiri Kylian one of the most important choreographers of the twentieth century.

Even when viewed on the small flat screen of my laptop and cut to fit the limited time available some of the sequences are still as beautiful as others are shocking.

You started reading a story... a boring story, that you dont even want to be reading, then as soon as anything remotely interesting starts happening the story stops.

But, if you want this game, please, take my word for it, you NEED to get the ORIGINAL in order to understand the concept of the game. Just type in: Cut The Rope Original. Then, you should see a Cut The Rope game with a yellow-ish orange-ish background and the green creature with the candy. Click on the free one.<br /><br />  Although, I'm STILL waiting for new levels.

B008BTC5E6|5.0|Very inspiring story, and very well written, also a lot of great information on nutrition and techniqur if you are a runner.
0385535147|5.0|Both my husband and I read through this novel quickly!  As is usually true with Grisham, the characters are interesting and well developed.  The twist comes slowly: I had to page through the middle of the novel to find out where the twist--climax?--really started.  It is a good read; we have two copies now but have enjoyed sharing it with other Grisham afficianados.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|though this book is quite disturbing ..it is also very interesting. It took a while to get used to some of the wording since it is told through the eyes of a child.Very well written.I did not want to stop reading !!!
0552150444|3.0|We are Frederick Forsyth fans in this household.  We speak often of his books and his characters.  This novel brings past characters to the scene but they don't seem to be as fully developed as previous works.  It is a good mystery thriller--I would certainly recommend it!--but it is not one I wil likely recall as fully or as fondly as some of his other works--i.e. The Icon.
B006LSZECO|4.0|It took me a while to get into this book. Once I did I could not put it down. Worth the read
B009YQJ322|4.0|First off, if you've ever seen the old [[ASIN:B004IDG97S Judge Dredd]] movie starring Sylvester Stallone and Rob Schneider, try to banish that from your mind before watching this movie. This movie is not (in any way) a sequel to that movie. It is a complete re-launch, entirely. It is packed from start to finish with loads of action and gun-play, and the acting is good. Although this movie is sci-fi, there really aren't a whole lot of sci-fi elements to it, so if you aren't a fan of that particular genre, don't be afraid that this movie will be off-putting to you by overloading you with all sorts of sci-fi gadgetry or exotic locales or aliens. All the characters are human and the crimes being committed are all very real problems. It just happens to be set in a slightly futuristic setting.<br /><br />Karl Urban is a great actor, and he plays an excellent Judge Dredd. Lena Headey, who has been making waves in Hollywood ever since the movie [[ASIN:B000V39KDO 300]], is an excellent villain in this movie, and newcomer Olivia Thirlby play an excellent Judge Anderson - the new recruit who happens to be a rare and powerful telepath.<br /><br />Dredd is almost exactly what you think it will be, but better. Definitely one of the best action movies to come out in 2012.
B006IYG5HE|5.0|This mystery/thriller tied the occupation of Norway during the second world war and modern day.  I enjoy the eccentric qualities of Inspector Hole.  The author, Jo Nesbo, tied the various characters together in a very taut story.
0385471378|5.0|This is quite a short book but written in a very unusual style. I really didn't know what was mean by the title but it actually refers to boiling water in order to make hot chocolate (the traditional/original way did not involve milk).<br />A lot of escapism in the book, and so much of the culture/history and social environment is well explained and important in following the plot. Whilst it's certainly not a cook book at all the frequent descriptions of cooking and domestic life are a key part of the main character's life.<br />The language is fairly straight forward so I can see why it would be recommended by some schools for learners of Spanish, although the themes in the book would interest adults more than young people.
B00BGI086Q|4.0|Have watched the first 16 episodes and have enjoyed them, this can be a really good series, but it is definetly not worth $51.00 for Season 1. Get it down to $30.00 or less and they could sell a whole lot more, actually I'll wait until Season 2 is about to be released and get Season 1 for $19.95 or less.
B00BBRPRDG|5.0|There have been times when a long awaited release has not lived up to expectation.  That is definitely not the case with this album.  Eleven years years is a long wait but listening to this for the first time I was rewarded with an album that has become one of my favorites.  The song Regret is likely to become a classic country-rock tune.  This version of Jack Sundrud's Hard Country is not the same as the concert version, it is better.  This song should the opening song in the next Farm Aid concert.  Buying this album will be one of the best decisions you make this year.
B007C52NY2|5.0|Could not put it down. Wife reading now. Mother in law is now reading first book. Saw the first movie and that is why I had to hjave the set.
B000FC1IPO|4.0|Kate Reddy is the classic workaholic with two kids and a doting husband. Urged on by a need to give her children a better life than she had, she juggles the two opposing parts of her life. Family and career face off at every turn. Almost every working mom can relate to this book. From the guilt you feel leaving your babies in someone else's care to the high you experience after kicking butt at work, most moms can find something familiar to laugh at.
B003K1EYM6|1.0|Had to return it because it was broken when it arrived.  Not sure how to rate it due to this.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I love these books. I'm not a big fan on reading but I'm so addicted to these books I've read them 3 times!! (So far) they have everything action, romance, drama, comedy...I love them
B009LMTDL0|5.0|This is a book that would be a tremendous aid to any young woman starting her career.  I admire Ms. Sandberg for taking the time to share her hard learned knowledge of how to succeed in today's business world and still have a life outside that job.  I thank her as a mother of a young female professional who is finding her way in the business world.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|It took me a little while to get used to the writing, as it it from the perspective if a five year old.  But once I adjusted, I could not stop reading this intense story. Such a uniquely written and fresh idea. I absolutely loved it.
B000FA675C|3.0|This may be the most popular and most controversial it is also not my favorite in the Langdon series I preferred Angels and Demons and am looking forward to Inferno.
B003TSEEDY|2.0|Not for adult reading. It felt like it was written for junior high level. I struggled to finish it and see where it ended up.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|My granddaughter loves the little characters and now she loves this game! I have had to buy her all the little shops to go along with the set.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|This book felt disjointed. It wore me out, but I read to the end to find some resolution to the chaos.
B002EMESSM|4.0|I don't want to write anything here so this is what I am entering and here are six more words
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|I thought the actors played their roles real well.  The movie as a whole gave true insights to the problems of the North and South.
0525457585|4.0|It was quite an experience reading this book. There were times when the reading of it came easy, other times when it was slow-going. There was an irritating section of the book where I never finished a chapter without falling asleep.  The first half of the book was easy and enjoyable to read. That's the part of the book that is just like the 80s movie. Once Bastian entered Fantastica, I became less interested and even annoyed at points. I did not like how disjointed the action was, I didn't like all the loose ends dangling out there with the tired clich&eacute; \\"that's another story for another time\\", I did not like Bastian being skinny and power-hungry. However, I really loved the last few chapters in which Bastian searches, grows, works, and loves. This short section is very deep and I wish I had more time to think about it. The city of old emperors, the sea of mist, the house of change, the mine of pictures, and the water of life were all wonderful pictures of what journeys we all go through in life. It was good to think about a question like: What sorts of things need to happen to us in order to make us content with life as it is? Perhaps we need to see the emptiness of where our own blind ambition may lead us, perhaps we need to experience a time of loneliness so that we desire relationships, perhaps we need to conform to a crowd for a while so that we desire individuality, perhaps we need to be children again for a time so that we desire self-giving, perhaps we need to work hard for a time and learn the value of work, perhaps we need to mine deeper, perhaps we need pictures in our minds of people we want to love.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I think this book is realy a wonderful addition to the growing library on near death experiences (NDEs), that give us here on the earth plane a better connection with what happens when we leave this physical body. It is very credible, and written by a man who had spent his career aurguing against the case he made in this book. It is a must read for people that still harbor a fear of dying, or hold grief in their hearts - from loosing a loved one.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|My son couldn't wait to watch this over, and over, and over again, and over, and over, and over again. haha
B001F0WXY0|5.0|Great edition, hope the rest of the books come with the same quality. Great collectible even in digital edition! Waiting for the rest of the chronicles.
B00C6ZC2GM|5.0|This is a MUST SEE show!!!  I love the characters and the storyline!!  Awesome writing!  Can't wait for Season 2 to come out!  For those people who think this a Super-Hero show, it is nothing like that and is definitely not corny!  The character of Oliver is very believable..... not anything like a comic strip hero.  If you don't believe me, watch the Pilot; you will be hooked!!
0307895475|5.0|This book is the Encyclopedia of Skyrim.  If you are having troubles with the game, need a map or want to know more specific information for making money, farming, quests or you name it, this is the book to purchase.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|DVD arrived on time and was as described - no skips or jumps. I had never heard of this movie before I say a trailer for it. It was a very good story.
B000FA675C|5.0|I love this book. Read it when it first came out and have re-read it several times since. A good, fast-paced read. It will have you asking questions.
B0001AVZA8|5.0|This DVD arrived on time and is in excellent condition - no skips or jumps. If you like comedies, this is a movie for you. I really enjoyed it.

B008JFUUQ2|5.0|If you like:<br />- College A Cappella<br />- Glee<br />- Movies ABOUT musicians - That Thing You Do!, Ray!, The Glenn Miller Story<br /><br />then this is for you.<br /><br />Good deal on the combo pack, too. Includes versions for EVERY scenario. I have a Bluray for home use, but DVD and digital copy are essential for &#34;on the go&#34; and maintaining a useable, working library of the films I want to own. I wish I could have full HD everywhere (though it's NOT necessary on the smallest screens!) and that we could break all the way out of this &#34;multi-format&#34; era where things aren't quite compatible across the board and I could &#34;just&#34; buy Blu or digital HD. Either way, it's a lot of physical storage or digital storage that everyone doesn't quite have available at this point in time.<br /><br />Nonetheless, this pack was a good buy at like $18 (on sale) for delivering multiple high-quality versions of a film that I think is just a blast to watch!
B0057UA4FY|4.0|kid loves it. some parts to adult for him but over all a good series just needs to finish some stories better.
1851775722|5.0|Now my wife and daughter-in-law's can prepare their costumes for the &#34;Dicken's&#34; era Fairs that we attend and participate in.
B0041KKYCY|5.0|I saw the original film years ago, so when I saw there was a remake I was excited to see it. Let me say this movie holds no punches. When I finished watching it for the first time my heart was racing, and my mouth was hanging open. I thought it was much better than the original. If you like to root for the good guy (or girl),this movie will give you all the justice you can stand. This girl does everything that anyone who has ever been the victim of a crime could think of, and then some. I loved it.

B004GUSG4M|2.0|The danger of a memory loss story is that the same thing happens over and over again, as it does in this story.  I was very bored and had things figured out very early.
B0068RHGJM|4.0|I love Nightwish, and always will. Why the missing star? When Anette's debut album \\"Dark Passion Play\\" came out, every Nightwish fan wondered how it will be with new front-woman. First listen to \\"Dark Passion Play\\", I loved it! So, of course I was excited when \\"Imaginaerum\\" came out. My expectations was high, Nightwish made it work with Anette's vocal style. I love almost every track from \\"Dark Passion Play\\", and I expected that with \\"Imaginaerum\\". The 2 tracks that stand-out for me: Storytime and Last Ride Of The Day. Then there's 3 tracks that I think are just ok: Ghost River, I Want My Tears Back, and Rest Calm. So for me, this album kinda fell short when previous album was awesome. I guess with \\"Dark Passion Play\\", the expectations wasn't there since I just wanted to know what the sound would be like with Anette. Loving \\"Dark Passion Play\\" so much is why I had high expectations for \\"Imaginaerum\\".
B0018QOIXU|5.0|The product arrived on time. Very satisfied with the order and product.
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|This is the album that introduced me to Nightwish and made me a big fan of the female-fronted metal bands in the gothic/symphonic genre. The album \\"Once\\" was being played at my local FYE music store one night, 8yrs ago. At the time I was into the male-fronted power/symphonic metal genre (Helloween, Avantasia, Hammerfall, etc) bands from Europe, so when I heard this playing I was amazed. Similar type of music but with a female vocalist. Ever since then I've purchased every Nightwish album, DVD, and albums, DVD from other female-fronted metal bands. Funny how the album that introduced me to Nightwish happened to be the last album with the great and beautiful \\"Tarja Turunen\\". And of course I own every Tarja album and DVD as well. I love this whole album but my most favorite is \\"Ghost Love Score\\", that is symphonic metal to the core! It's like listening to an epic movie credit while banging your head.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|The product arrived on time. Very satisfied with the order and product.
B000URDEB0|5.0|I remember the much anticapation release for this album, without the great, beautiful Tarja Turunen. How the new sound will be with new front-woman Anette Olzon. I knew I would still love Nightwish, I just didn't know how much I would love this album! Nightwish did an awesome job working there sound around Anette's vocal style. Anette brings a new and refreshing sound with her vocal style to the symphonic, dark passion play (hint, hint) style of Nightwish. From the first listen to the first track of \\"Dark Passion Play\\", I knew Anette was the right choice. I love this whole album, but if I had to chose the most stand-outs for me it would have to be Bye Bye Beautiful and Amaranth.
B003L77GGK|5.0|great show good price
B000PKG7TI|5.0|Long time Nightwish fan here, and long overdue review for this. Nightwish was the band that started me in the female-fronted metal bands of the gothic/symphonic genre of Europe. The album, \\"Once\\" was playing at my locel FYE music store 8 yrs ago. Now, at that time I was into power metal bands from Europe (Helloween, Avantasia, Hammerfall, etc). Ever since then, it's been nothing but female-fronted metal bands for me. When \\"End Of An Era\\" came out I was so excited as I already had purchased all of Nightwish's back catalogue. I love everything about this DVD, but my only complaint while watching it was there was no orchestra. For one night, just for this DVD, could Nightwish not have done what Within Temptation did for \\"Black Symphony\\"? They got a live orchestra just for that one night, for that one DVD. A minor complaint, other than that I love this DVD, and still am a big Nightwish fan.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Such an adventurous woman! Allowed me to hike vicariously. I think anyone would enjoy this book. Buy it - you'll love it!
B003YL4LYI|2.0|I looked forward to reading this fifth edition for some closure concerning many of the characters.  Martin had so many characters,<br />that apparently were killed off then all of a sudden they reappear like he forgot they were dead.  Brienne and Catelyn  are two examples.  The story line did not always follow an order as it went from character to character.  I sometimes had the feeling that the author had forgotten his story .  Perhaps the book was too long and he got bored with it.  Over all I finished it and still felt it was the did not have proper ending.

B002GHHHPQ|5.0|Pretty good story. Thousands of planes and crews in this part of the War.<br />There are so many stories, but these guys made history and were immortalized<br />for how they lived it and lived through it.
B008TMA1LY|5.0|it is fun and a good ga<br />me for kids ages 6 and up also you can play it for free
B001IBIHQ4|3.0|Not up to Band of Brothers standard. Awfully big War to cover in time allowed.<br />The idea of using the two books as basis for an all encompassing look at the war even from the grunts stand point was maybe not so good. Thought coverage of John Basilone was flawed. Too much to cover for time again.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I was a great movie.  The ending wasn't as good as it could have been, but it left the opening for another.

B004DLPXAO|5.0|I've never had an e reader and this Kindle on my phone is amazing.  I haven't had any problems with it,  it's easy to use and my husband loves that I can turn the lights off when I read at night now.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I would have given it a five out of five if not for the annoying ads that pop up at the beginning of each game. Otherwise I love this game.
B000PMG16U|5.0|This w as purchased for a 7 year old boy.  Judging by his excitement when he opened it;  it is a perfect gift for this little one.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Simple game, yet lots of fun and very addictive. I recomend this game for all to play and enjoy  this game rocks
B004GJDQT8|2.0|amazon is so stellar at just about everything they do, however this mobile app is so not up to par with my expectations from one of two of my favorite companies. it is boring, not very intuitive, lacking most of my needs that i usually just end up going to the amazon full website
B000I0QL82|4.0|My wife and I love to watch the old Classic Christmas movies, and this is one of them. If you haven't seen this one, we definitely recommend it for your collection of Christmas DVDs.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I only wish that there was more of the story.  It was hard to let go of the story once I got to the last page.  At this point, I am just rereading the entire series.
B0040HO16S|5.0|This show is completely captivating!  I am a fan of many types of drama and what I love most about Lark Rise to Candleford is it's ability to enthrall and enchant without the use of vulgarity, nudity, dragons, heinous crimes, blood baths, gorgeous undead boyfriends, and gratuitous emotional exploitation.  It's nice to be able to enjoy a show during the day without worrying about the kids seeing it.  There are occasional loopholes, a few characters just randomly disappear with side stories left dangling, but that's okay.  It's like an antique piece of furniture with a few scratches, a knob or two missing, but still a beautiful treasure.
0231161166|5.0|This is an excellent book written by a research scientist who can weave a tale with a sense of humor.  Nessa Carey does a wonderful job of explaining epigenetics in the context of the human condition.  If you want to understand the basis for this area of study, this is a great place to start.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This is the first Stephen King book I've finished and I am IN LOVE. I only read this because of a book club challenge. I am not a fan of horror, so I have dismissed King's previous works. I'm VERY glad that I picked this up.<br /><br />I had a hard time putting the book down: I could \\"see\\" the world that King built and felt like I knew Jake/George. I couldn't wait to read more! I got very little sleep last night, but it was totally worth it. I put the kids in front of the t.v. this morning so I could finish reading.<br /><br />The ending was perfect. Bittersweet, but perfect.

B003YFIUW8|5.0|I'm always leery of reading a best-seller, since I hate having high expectations only to end up reading a disappointing book.<br /><br />This is not one of those times.<br /><br />I can't say enough good things about Room. It's poignant, heartbreaking, hopeful. I cried at several points.<br /><br />I read almost all of it in one sitting and am completely bummed that it's over.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Great movie!!! Make my day, a lot of movement and energy. Exceed my expectation. Would recommend to my friends. Love it.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|This is the best fantasy book ever written.  By the end you'll be holding your breath for entire chapter! Just read it all!  Twice.
0061726834|5.0|Besides the \\"Hunger Games\\" similarity, I really enjoyed this book. I thought it was very well written with some twists and turns. At times, I had to reaaly focus to keep reading since it goes a little slow at times. Overall, it was a good read.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I haven't picked up a book in years and now this book has made me remember how good reading is. This book has such a great story you won't want to put it down. You just get lost in the book and forget about time. This would be a very highly recommended book.
B007Y36K46|5.0|Lets start with the bad.  Why did they not market this movie better???  This movie was fun and a wonderfully adventerous movie.  The marketing did not even allow the public to know it existed until 2 weeks prior to release.  They must have wanted it to fail.  Well we went to see it anyhow.  Taylor was fun to watch and having enjoyed him from his days in TV and his small role in Xmen, we were happy to see him cast in the lead.  This movie was the kind of action adventure that lets you escape on a rainy afternoon to a world you can only imagine.  The love story was wonderful and the supporting characters were so interesting.  Things reminded me of the unique characters from Star Wars movies!!<br />My vote is out there for a sequel and we own this on on DVD so we can watch it anytime and escape to Barsoom.
B00AFROVQC|3.0|I admit it, I'm not crazy about these books but I've made it through #4 in the series so I guess that means something.  Here's my pros and cons about the series in general:<br />Pros:<br />Lots of action.  There's always something going on.<br />Fight scenes I can actually visualize.  The author does a good job of explaining the moves so I can see it in my mind.<br />The main story line is good.  This is probably the reason I made it through them all.  I like the concept.<br /><br />Cons:<br />It's difficult for me to grasp the timeline of all these books.  It feels like the character covered about 6 months in the first 4 books, which is pretty fast for him to go from a lowly shepherd to an amazing warrior, but pretty slow for it to take 4 books.  Plus, there were things (I'll cover in a moment) that seem like in the realm of Earth would take longer to occur.  Maybe this world just has the ability to fast track stuff.<br />People and animals in this book heal amazingly fast (realm of Earth stuff here).  For instance, one character gets in a horrible battle, gets beat up, broken ribs, and knocked unconscious, but is able to get up and attend a party a few hours later. WTHeck? You'll see this repeat throughout the series.<br />You will never want to travel with Thor unless you are one of his friends.  Any other legion troop that doesn't have a name is merely an ensign and destined to die.  Poor suckers.  I'd go AWOL.<br /><br />At the end of the day I'd say I understand it's geared for younger readers.  I've made it one of my &#34;breather&#34; novels that's a nice break from some of the heavier stuff I read.  It's an easy, quick read and I'll continue to follow it just to see where the main story goes.
B004G6009U|5.0|Cute cute movie. My granddaughter has watched this over and over again, she loves it. Fast shipping. Great product for the Grandkids!!
B00BGIC2J2|3.0|This movie was okay.  It had some real funny parts, but I thought it was kind of depressing at times.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|ok, like the game but have been having issues. it says I have 5 lives, I play one round and I have no lives left. why is this happening? not happy with the fact that I can't continue with the game. thinking about taking it off my kindle.

B00AB7HESI|4.0|One of the few mobile games that is actually awesome. While it was a bit dissapointing to see how simple and short many of the levels are compared to the console version of scribblenauts unlimited, it still boasts the extraordinary complex system of not only being able to create virtually any noun you can think of, but having them behave and interact with everything in realistic ways, and be modified by adjectives. I only wish the levels truly showcased how impressive their engine really was.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This app was very easy to download. Easy to use.Very fun to pass the time.I recommend this to anyone who enjoys solitaire.

B009LMTDL0|5.0|Very personal account of her life and the lessons that can be extracted from it. Very motivating but not to be confused with a feminist manifesto which it does not pretend to be.
B0018BF1KY|5.0|This box has five great albuns and is a good deal.<br />But the package production is very poor!<br />And that's the same thing with any \\"box\\" package of this type.<br />If you, like me, appreciate the sleeve notes, technical information and lyrics, you might consider passing this one and searching for other versions of this classics.<br />If you just want to hear the music, get this one. It even has bonus tracks!
B00AKFG15S|5.0|Jeffrey Archer is a great storyteller.  This book is as good as the first two in the series. A quick read, I am looking forward to the next one!
B0089LOG02|5.0|This is quite an intriguing and paralleling journey for two connected kindred spirits.  Life has  dealt some of  these children more pain than necessary.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Now I understand why there was so much buzz about this show - it is smart and honest and depicts a woman struggling (brilliantly) to recover from her husband's betrayal - a betrayal that was made very public. I look forward to watching the whole series.
B001EN71CW|5.0|I love firefly.<br /><br />That said, the blu-ray is terrific if you can darken your media room sufficiently. The darker parts of the series are hard to watch otherwise.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Supremely written and cast.  Great production values.  Interesting story lines. Captivating and addicting.  Overall it's outstanding.  I'm already missing it since season 4 isn't out yet. Please hurry.
B00BJNHACS|5.0|Slingshot Racing is everything a physics app should be: simple to control, aesthetically stunning, and difficult to master. Essentially, the game is applied geometry; you try to exit turns to do proper racing lines (outside, inside, outside), which means you have to exit at the proper tangent to set yourself up for the following turn or straightaway.<br /><br />The game is simple to play, with a simple click-anywhere, stop-clicking-anywhere control mechanism. The graphics are delightful and slightly Steampunk. It plays well on a phone and a Fire.
B004SH40BQ|5.0|I'm a farmer...I love to listen to music while I work, but don't enjoy getting tangled. The Bluetooth transmitter is perfect! Now I can chop weeds without jerking my ears off! The sound quality is excellent!
B000BNX4MC|5.0|This is such a feel good, family film. Just love it. So funny and enjoyable. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a fun and lighthearted film.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|The news feed wont update. It shows post that are weeks old and it just will not update. Not cool.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|The author is awful. I have no problem with the subject matter, but this thing has worse prose than a porno screenplay.  This is very explicit, but the best phrase the author comes up with for the female anatomy is &#34;down there.&#34;  At least twice per chapter, the protagonist blushes, or as this author calls it &#34;Flushes&#34;  Oh yeah she bites her lip.  A lot.  A lot, lot.  And He runs his hands through his hair a lot.  When he is stressed, when he is angry, when he is frustrated, when he is playful, when he wakes up, when he,,okay you get it?  Now to be fair, I have not (nor will I) read the next two parts of the trilogy, but c'mon!  The characters are no deeper than the page they are written on.  They could at least be a little more believable.  He had a rough childhood, spent years and years as a submissive, went to college? started up businesses, some sort of non-specific &#34;manufacturing&#34; and something world wide that is ending world hunger.  He also has a stable of identical employees who do his every wish without question and have been with him for years.  He has time to be sending emails and texts at any and all times of day, he learned how to fly a helicopter, cares deeply about waste, but takes his helicopter on dates.  His home is equipped with everything the 21st century has to offer, including a well equipped torture chamber.  Oh yeah, and he's done all this and still in his mid-twenties.  Oh yeah, and the book styarts when a student reporter has the opportunity to interview this mysterious, famous, billionaire, but is feeling sick, so she sends her friend who has no experience at all.  Yeah, that'll happen.  I think if either character was even a little believable, or a little sympathetic, we might care what happens, but no, it is just a waste of time that I would like back if it were possible.
B002GZQYMK|5.0|This is one of those albums that you can just put on in the background when you are work and not get too distracted.  Every song is good or good enough that you do not have to skip any tracks.  Cool album art also.
B00004TJKI|5.0|I got it to play a certain scene for law students and young attorneys that poses an important ethical question.  I won't spoil anything, but it is in an early scene where Jimmy Stewart first talks with his client, and lectures him on the finer points of the law.  Lawyers have argued for years as to what they thought of the ethical issues raised.
B004UOE7VA|5.0|Very good album to work with in the background.  I think this is some sort of remix but I have listened to this one and the normal one (with a blue cover) and without really trying to hard, I can not tell you what the difference is.  In any case, good album.
B00C32R64G|5.0|The best thing about this album in my opinion, is the lack of &#34;radio friendly&#34; hits so everybody can jump on the Volbeat bandwagon.
B00BAB6CNC|5.0|I loved this CD right from the first listen! The songs are diverse and all have great melodies, vocals and lyrics. This is the first CD I've bought in a long time where I can listen to the whole thing straight through. I liked Part 1, but honestly like this one much better. Some people seem to care how heavy it is, I just want good songs and this has them.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This movie was so awesome. I had to get it on DVD. Excellent family movie! I love the director of this film! I own all the movies he has produced!
B002VH7P4O|4.0|So I would like to start off by saying that I don't usually buy music in digital content form.  Most music I buy are vinyl records and cds; vinyl is obviously my preferred choice.  So when the Beatles Vinyl Box set came out; I had to have it; promising the best sound of the 2009 remasters.  Well that vinyl sucked because of pressing issues; after going through 3 box sets of vinyl I had enough and thought maybe this usb apple could fill the void.<br /><br />Being that I am a die hard analog guy; I was skeptical of such a device.  I started by firing the drive up this evening and I started playing some of the flacs from Magical Mystery Tour and also Yellow Submarine; wow this thing sounds great and I really think this is money well spent.  I have spent the evening cranking this thing through my vintage Marantz receiver and I am extremely satisfied with my purchase.<br /><br />I also checked out part of the mini documentaries and they seem pretty cool too; all stuff we have seen before; but its still nice to have these short clips. You can look at the original artwork as there are digital copies of all the albums artwork and inserts.  No its not the same as holding the jackets in your hands but they do have a magnify option that makes it easier to read and move around the various images.<br /><br />So lets talk about that packaging and what you are getting: 14 digital albums in both flac and mp3; artwork and the mini documentary videos.  Both sets of files are DRM free and you can easily copy everything off this usb drive to something else.  My stem was broken; but super glue fixed me up pretty quickly.  Take care to remove the usb drive by not pulling on the stem; as this was a crummy design; I wish the apple had a small hook on the top of the usb for a small string to help you extract it from the heavy metal apple.  You can wiggle it out from side to side with your nails; the usb drive is magnetic and is attracted to the apple.  So I find it easier to remove it withthe apple on it's side or inverted.  Just take care not drop it; as it is heavy and could do damage to itself or the floor.  The packaging does not support the stem properly and I think that is part of the problem with it breaking in shipping.<br /><br />My final verdict: if you like high quality sound and were burned by the vinyl remasters; this will suffice.  Definitely has cleaner sound than the CD box set and was exactly what I wanted to fill the void after returning my Christmas present; just 2 weeks before Christmas.
B001ECDVKE|4.0|I don't like Tim Burton films but this is an exception.  This movie is so goofy and silly you can't help but laugh.  So if you like goofy and silly, you will like this movie.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|For me, a very bittersweet introduction to some terrific writing and ensemble acting.  The &#34;Goodbye&#34; refers to Steven J. Cannell who passed away not long after doing some guest appearances in Castle's weekly poker game.  He also did some &#34;Bonus features&#34; for this 1st season of a comedy/drama/romance that was obviously close to his heart.  Whatever the amount of influence he might have had was most likely in the writing department, which is where its creator, Andrew W.Marlowe, has excelled.  This series is listed in the TV Guide as a &#34;Comedy&#34;.  But the clever way that drama is woven into the comedy (or vice-versa) makes it even more likable for the viewer.  Plus the interaction of stars Nathan Fillion (Firefly) and lovely Canadian actor Stana Katic (The Librarian #3) is one of the very best on TV these days, PERIOD!  Rick Castle (&#34;Master of the Macabre&#34;) is the well-connected, successful writer whose friendship with the Mayor gets him into the NYPD Precinct for the research he needs for his next series — after he kills off the &#34;hero&#34; of his wildly successful crime novels.  His first attraction/confrontation with Detective Kate Beckett (Katic) makes for an instant love/hate relationship that develops well over time, making it almost inevitable that the two will eventually be an &#34;item&#34;. The supporting cast of Castle makes this a true ensemble piece, with Seamus Dever and John Huertas doing the gopher work and backing up the lead team wonderfully well.  Mystery Writer Rick Castle's family is no less than absolutely charming and equally as quirky (in some respects) as he is.  Molly Quinn is real heartbreaker as Castle's daughter Alexis, a remarkably well grounded young lady, and veteran actress Susan Sullivan is the Grand Dame of the family, Martha Rogers, and provides the connection that every family needs as Castle's Mother.  The development of the characters is terrific, with the viewer getting more and more insight into what makes Castle — and the rest of the characters as well — really tick.  If you remember &#34;Moonlighting&#34; or &#34;The Rockford Files&#34;, you will get very comfortable quickly with Castle.  Did I mention the writing??  One cannot stress enough how well it is done here.  The storylines are varied and equally quirky as some of the characters investigating them.  The City of New York may make this familiar ground for many viewers, and adds to the possibilities of interesting storylines.  This variety of crimes and scoial interaction may be the best thing that has happened to a series on TV for many, many years!  As comfortable as reading a book, you will absolutely find Castle to be a fun evening in front of the Small Screen.  Now in its fifth season, we can only hope that this series has many more to come; as in my mind this is one comedy/drama that is still developing nicely and continues to improve with age.  Fast moving, with great attention to detail, this is something that can be viewed over and over again with a big smile on your face!
1592332803|5.0|Colleens books are amazing. Easy to read and very encouraging for those trying to make life changes, even if you are not there yet.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|&#34;Castle&#34; is one of the most successful series on TV, PERIOD.  The writing and characterizations make this eminently watchable fare for those who enjoy comedy, drama, mystery, romance, FUN!, fast paced action, well directed storylines, exceptionally well written and FUN TV viewing!  Castle is all of that and more.  Well integrated as an ensemble piece should be, it never lets you lose sight of its main intention — FUN!  This second season of writer Rick Castle and Detective Kate Beckett's characters becomes more involved romantically, and at the same time reveals deeper personal involvement that my keep tham apart for longer than you might like.  However, the story of the lead players also lets us get more personal with the supporting cast, which is wonderfully well done.  The more you watch it, the more you'll like it!  Simply put, it would make its late &#34;Godfather&#34;, Steven J. Cannell, very happy to see the success it has garnered.  I can make no better comment than to say it deserves your watching.  You can preview it for FREE on ABC-affiliate TNT re-runs several afternoons a week.  Several seasons are being shown at the moment, and as current Season-5 draws to a close in its Monday night time slot, you will get to see more of Castle through Season-4 — and maybe beyond.<br />However, I am a real fan of continuity, which is to say a lack of distractions.  The DVD set is quite affordable through 3rd party sellers at Amazon, and even at its full rlease price it is not overdone.  The 1st Season was an abbreviated one, but has lots of &#34;bonue features&#34; that make up for &#34;only&#34; 10 episodes.  In fact, the bonus material might help you re-focus on what the creator and director have in mind.  More than this will make my comments redundant, so I will just say go see some episodes, or just buy a good used or new set of DVD's, and enjoy the lack of distractions (commercials).  This is one TV Series that has just about all you want without excess.  Limited graphic looks at murder victims, romance, FUN! (and comedy, too), suspense, GREAT dialog, wonderful characters, continual development, and FUN!  If you think you owe yourself more enjoyment in front of the Small Screen, than THIS IS IT!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really love this game, it's got good graphics and is really addictive!! I also really like how you go from place to place and it changes the scenery! Overall this is a great game!!
B005FJ79DM|4.0|No matter who plays the lead I am always cheering for Jane Eyre it is a timeless classic to be enjoyed by all.
B00BWJ91XK|5.0|This movie was awesome! It doesn't follow the book very well, but it is still super good. If you like adventure, and action, this is the movie for you.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love Downton Abbey.  So glad someone has finally made something worth watching.  Love PBS.  Glad they are enjoying success of a series.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I was hooked the first time I saw this,now I cant stop watching,I have my kids watching now and they love it too !!!!
B005K17RU0|3.0|While the app is still very informative, I prefer the previous version. The new update changed the entire layout. It no longer fits my screen (I have the regular Kindle Fire) which makes me think that it is now formatted for the larger Kindle Fire HD screen. Previously I would have given this a 4 or 5 star rating, but now I feel it has beclme more cumbersome. Some of the additions were nice, like the maps, but sometimes simpler is better.
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|I usually love Apatow movies but this one really went nowhere!  There didn't seem to be a story and you quickly start to hate both of the characters.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|Hard to put down.  Loved this collection of random stories and the incites Gladwell provided to make you think!  I'm moving onto his other books.  A terrific author!
B001MSMULG|4.0|Interesting read. He'd my interest and ade me desire to read on without stopping. Detailed descriptions of ancient place in world history. I will read more  of Mr. Silva's novels
B000NIVJGI|5.0|Classic movie that growing up my mom and aunt loved. I admit I know the movie word for word and figured I'd give it a shoot on Blu Ray since I only had a copy on DVD.
B008393Q2O|4.0|A fairly basic notepad.  I've used a few other apps like this and this one worked best for me. I have no complaints.
B0055PGUYU|4.0|As many, I have habits which I wish I didn't. To help move beyond that, I'm looking for help.<br /><br />This book isn't quite a self-help book. It is, however, a highly interesting study of habits and how they affect our lives in a variety of ways, including how habits can survive brain damage, companies be turned around by changing employees habits, and how retailers *exploit our habits* for profit. Beyond that, the author does break down the psychological mechanism of habits, and suggests ways to change that.<br /><br />In any case, the understanding of how other people can manipulate our habits is worth the price in and of itself.
B000006NUW|5.0|This 4 cd collection is a must for Motown fans.  It contains a ton of hits plus a few hit wannabe's.  I heartily recommend this fine collection!
B00A6SZRJ0|5.0|This was my original purchase and I have almost worn it out!! It is magical music at its very best.
B008N9AAQ4|3.0|Baraka blew my mind away when I first saw it. It's a very powerful audiovisual experience & an introspective look on how, when confronted with the beauty & awe-inspiring mystery of the natural world, culture & religion have always tried to explain the human condition throughout the ages —although the film also puts a heavy emphasis on how our 'modern' society has severed our connection to Nature, to the detriment of our civilization & the planet.<br /><br />So, getting back to Samsara, while I enjoyed it & I still recommend it, it must be said that it didn't proposed anything beyond what Baraka had already offered. You'll find the same type of cinematic structure, using different locations. But I admit it left me a bit disappointed.<br /><br />Props to the filmmakers for trying to outdo their previous masterpiece, though.
B005K15XR4|5.0|Thanks to my son, I already loved Freedom Fighters. That and Tristan are my favourite tracks even though the others are unreal too. As a big classical fan, this 'contemporary classical' goes above my expectations.
B008LZHA3G|5.0|Way to go. I feel like I'm back in '74 between 'Time Out Mind' and Tempest. Together they make a nice pair out of all the 21st century output. The Tom Waits grunge guitar sound on Duquesne Whistle there coupling with the ragtime ditty. And the tunes just get better from there...
B001EO2UJK|5.0|Wow ! This is a Great package. I love the DVD's. What a Great Band, and What a Great time too enjoy music from the 70's .
B00506NRBS|4.0|This is a book about a guy named Derek Sivers, who happened to be a musician that was not pleased with the music distribution industry. He developed a solution that would be the best for him (as a client), and accidently found 150.000 other musicians interested in it. Has he done market research? Developed marketing campaigns? Invested USD 500k? No, he just did what was best for the clients (and got paid over USD 22 MN).
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|A wonderful movie. This needs to be a watch once and forget it for a year then go back. I personally cannot re-watch this one over and over because of the stretched out dialog and stretched out fight scenes. A first time through you don't even notice the stretching because it is all new and fresh.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|This book is a easy read....Have you ever read a book and found yourself talking out loud to the characters!  Well this book will make you do that! Good from beginning to the end!
B0060MYM7O|5.0|An amazing series, second season did not disappoint. I am going to give it a little more time before a re-watch but I don't see any reason to wait other than it will feel fresher if I wait longer.
B001DE29SS|5.0|i remembered seeing this a long time ago and loved it. so glad i bought it, its great to see it again
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|an amazing show and well worth the purchase. Please be aware that there is nudity, gore, and all the things that would scare away the faint of heart. If you don't mind sex and gore, then this is a wonderful show with great character development, a slow plot line but the slowness of the plot is not noticeable because you get wrapped up in the soap opera of everything else going on.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|it is amazing u should toataly get it it is free so it is 2 times better when it is free
B000AJIF4E|2.0|I bought these with the intention of using these during drum practice and rehearsal, but I was really disappointed with them. I have had Sony headphones before and have been really happy with them, but I had to replace them. So I chose to spend a little more money to buy these and I have to say, overall, not a good good. The mid-range is okay and the highs are great. But there's literally no low-end bass. I get better bass out of my ear buds.<br /><br />They also did not fit real well. As I played, they slipped of my ears to easy, especially if I sweat a bit. Not good when you're a drummer.<br /><br />I sent them back... I hope to find another pair I'll be happy with without spending hundreds of dollars.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Being able to place so many amazing dinosaurs and have a park based around it is amazing. So many people used to dream of this, now they can live it !
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love this series!  Can't wait for the next season to see how they continue this comic book inspired drama.  Way to go AMC.
B008QE9XD2|5.0|i consider this to be one of his best along with the other actors the only movie that didnt Hang to Hard on the twilight theme
B008KRJWEK|5.0|Very addicting but very hard to to get good  trucks.  My highest is 10.58 miles and about 700 coins. Overall this is a topnouch game tests u on ur driving for the zombie apocalypse. I would recomend this game for boys and girls and men and women.
B00028HBKM|5.0|Very vivid and emotional. It looks well done. Not low budget. It was biblically accurate with some creative license. Everyone should see this movie. It brings the Bible to life.
B000I0QL82|5.0|The film is a good quality with zero problems with color or sound. It's nice to have a copy of this classic on hand and not have to wait for it to show up on the &#34;Commercials Channels.&#34;
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Best available keyboard on the market.  Have it installed on my phone and my wife's tablet, we it absolutely love it.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Denzel Washington brings realism to the plot.  When he is flying the plane, you get lost in the story and his fall from grace due to unhinged and addicted drinking feels so horrific.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|This show is fast paced, has plenty of violence, and adventure.  I find myself pulling for different characters to win.
076781214X|5.0|This is one I like to watch over and over. The price was right. Was shipped right away, and I have enjoyed having my own copy.
B0047Y0FGY|2.0|I would have enjoyed it more if the story was told without trying to be funny in every 3 sentences.
B000N2HBSO|4.0|I am reading this book for our book club.  The book is very long and we have decided to make a a two month read rather than one.<br />I am finding it very insightful and educational.  I highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in history and especially the evolution of the political parties in America, the Civil War and Lincoln.
159562015X|4.0|This is a great read for learning your strengths and how to use them to excel in your everyday life as well as your work environment.  StrengthsFinder gives you an insight to dealing with others, how they may perceive you and how you can effectively understand them to best utilize their strengths.  It's a great team building project/read to learn about teammates and how you can be a more effective team.  Although a large portion seems like common sense, it was good to have it so well organized as a learning tool.  Highly recommended as a team exercise.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Very User friendly, and informative. Anyone who is and wants to be aware of local/international weather patterns should have or download accuweather
B004KPX4W2|4.0|We needed a candidate for &#34;dumb movie night&#34; with another couple, so we rented this one for something light and entertaining.  Everyone really liked it.  A lot of action, funny, and even an engaging story in the background.  You probably need to be a bit of a firearms enthusiast to appreciate to full impact (if so, you're gonna love it!), but everyone will like it.  It was a pleasant surpirse.
B007C4ZJ3K|4.0|I like action, this movie has plenty of it.  The plot is good, but the acting or directing left the movie a bit flat.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|fast reading and loved them all  I was happy that I could borrow them from amazon  I read them all
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Really enjoy piano and cello together, makes for a great arrangement and sound. Can't wait until their next cd comes out.
B0087GJ8KM|4.0|Daniel Pink is the wonderful author of [[ASIN:1594484805 Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us]], which taught me so much about motivation. I cite it all the time. Dan Pink did it again in To Sell Is Human. I was actually surprisingly acquainted with a fair amount of the research in this one. What Daniel Pink calls selling is what my negotiation professor Stephen Hayford calls negotiation or my psychology professor Scott Thompson would call social influence. Whatever it's called, it's the study of persuasion techniques. It was full of valuable insights about business in particular and full of anecdotes about interesting cases. I definitely would recommend this book.
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|Daniel day Lewis is phenomenal as Lincoln. Must see! Gives insight into the workings of government and the dealings happening even back then
B0055PGUYU|5.0|If you have ever wanted to exercise more or lose weight, Charles Duhigg tells you how to do that. I know that the book isn't marketed as a weight-loss tool, but it could be. I tell everyone to read this book. The insights in this book were so good and complex and I constantly reread it. I've honestly opened this book more than 50 times in the year or so since it came out. Charles Duhigg is an investigative genius and he finds very interesting real-world examples to illustrate what the research shows. Tying the idea of habits into his own life just made the book even stronger. When I read this book for the second time, I was so engrossed that I missed my subway stop and stayed on the train while it circled around to go in the opposite direction. That has never happened with any book (and I hope it won't happen again), but it speaks to the power of the enthralling information and the effective prose in this book. If you like Drive by Dan Pink, you'll like this book. If you understand the idea that humans are cognitive misers, you'll like this book.
B003E6LC6I|5.0|Damages, seasons 1 through 3 (have not finished season 4) will keep you riveted.  And watching them on Amazon Instant Video one right after the other instead of waiting for a week, makes it even better!!  Patricia Hewes is a strong lawyer who fights to the finish to get what she wants and what her clients deserve. And her protege Ellen is just as strong and cunning.  Watching as Ellen goes through her growth (both personally and professionally) is tough - from her boyfriend being killed, to quitting the firm, to the death of her future partner.  If you like lawyer series, this is ONE OF THE BEST!!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I as enthralled throughout the novel. In the end part of me understood why choices were made but didn't make me want to beat the hell out of them any less.
B007TK77QE|2.0|Nothing I like in it. The story, the characters or anything. I imagine it's like watching Coronation Street. Maybe she should stick with Harry Potter.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I really like this show. Its got everything you would want from a series. Its fun and entertaining. The flashbacks remind me of lost
B0017TYPIG|4.0|Enjoyed this more after many years gone by. The blue ray disc is very good. One of Paul Newmans best at his best..
B00B2QG3K2|5.0|I have to admit that I thought Paramore spark was gone when the Farros left, I mean a genius guitarist like Josh and a bad ass drummer like Zac, it was just a big let down for me. I knew Taylor was a blessing coming into the band the time he did. He is also skillful at writing music and it shown in this album. I didnt like much of paramores single club singles but Monster was good potential, this album is amazing.<br /><br />Future , the last track has so much emotions in it when you hear Hayley singing so lightly and soft and this heavy guitar and instruments sweeps in and I picture Hayley head banging to the drum, all there struggles and happy moments, i can feel it in the music. Im proud to say paramore has made it though the Farros leaving. Good album, every dong is great
1250006341|5.0|This guide/representation of the series is great if you have and enjoy this program. It makes one geared up to watch all and any future episodes. Many stills, and information about the time period that was also going on at the time.
0345528581|5.0|This is a great comprehensive introduction to body-weight fitness.  Lauren outlines lots of different body-weight exercises and covers not only how to do them safely but what muscles they target and how to put them together into a complete workout to achieve your goals.  The photos and exercise descriptions are more than adequate to learn how to do the exercises properly.
B0063FGFK0|5.0|This was an upgrade from my previous blue ray disc. I wanted the extras i.e. book, print information etc. You also get an additional version of the film. I enjoyed it enough to make this upgrade.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Fun way to waste time. Nice graphics. Works well on Kindle Fire. Glad to see it is a free app!
B007L96VCY|5.0|Paul McCartney is always good!  This disc is one of his top five. Makes you feel good while you are listening to the songs as they come up.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|Just okay.  Good characterization and plot development. However I am  fun of literature and this novel is not anything but entertaining.
B000002UVX|5.0|Very good music. I have owned this LP since it came out and did not know that is was available on CD. You can hear the speaking in between the songs more clearly now. Very satisfying.
1476733953|5.0|I have the book and the ebook.  I also have read the Silo series.  Love it all!  Only wish Hugh had more time to write more books.
B004A8ZWWY|4.0|A rental at first. Bought afterwards. Interesting and entertaining. The characters play diferent rolls than I had seen before i.e. Alan Alda, Eddie Murphy etc. Have watched several times since. Clear picture and good sound, photography.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I have played many games like this ( pet shop, ice age) but this is really cool.  I love how you get to drive and save an animal instead of paying ethier money (real) or fake money on the game. I love the graphics and sound effects
B002I0J5FG|5.0|Both games are very different from one another, but excel in very similar ways. Both offered just enough mysterious story elements to keep you intrigued and wanting to discover more about your character and the world you inhabit. The &#34;puzzles&#34; are challenging, but not so much that you become frustrated and discouraged (well once in a while, but in a very, very, good way). Both offered atmospheric, well-rendered worlds that were fun to explore and characters that you quickly became emotionally attached to. While older titles, the game do not feel dated, and in my opinion, were more fun to play and better constructed than many of the newer popular titles I've played. I only wish the games were longer so that I could still enjoy the gameplay and visit these worlds, yet sadly, the replay value is minimal once you've discovered all the &#34;secrets&#34; to progressing through the castle or slaying each of the colossi. I hope the next title in this &#34;series,&#34; The Last Guardian, materializes soon. If it remotely captures the sense of adventure, exploration, atmosphere, and charming characters, it is sure to be a huge success, and yet another classic must-have game from Japan Studios.
B001JNNDDI|5.0|Not everyone I've talked to about this movie loves it.  If quirky movies are high on your list this might be your cup of tea
B00B2V66VS|5.0|ITS SO FUN YOU CAN PLAY ALL DAY AND STILL NOT GET BORED. THE BIG MONSTER SCARES YOU AND YOU GO EVEN MORE FUN. IF U LOVE THIS GAME TRY OUT SUBWAY SURFERS.<br /><br />I RECCOMEND THIS GAME.<br />PS I HAVE 7 kids that means I have 7 I pads. THIS KEEPS THEM ENTERTAINED.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|I bought this gift for my dad and he absolutely loved it and it was delievered really fast and efficient. I will Definitly buy fro this person again.
0345803485|1.0|Worst book, I ever read.  Glad I borrowed them and not spent the money, although reading them was a waste of my time.
B004SEUJ82|5.0|it gave me a view of the nazi war camps that i had not seen before..it was so very touchinmg and such a very tragic story and a tragic time for the whole world but it was well writen and very well acted...
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|Fun read with many twists.and turns! Fast, fun and hard to put down.  Not just for young adults and or kids.
B00000K3D4|5.0|Bowie doesn't do alot of singing on this, Grimly humorus, morality-play issues, such as...&#34;Be careful WHAT you wish for!&#34;<br />Story of a teenage girl that feels imposed-upon when made to babysit her half-brother for a few hours....And &#34;wishes&#34; him away, starting the trek through the Labyrinth to find him before the &#34;Goblin-King&#34;, (Bowie) has full ownership of the baby. &#34;Forever and Ever&#34;.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Having lived through the 30's 40's 50's 60's to date, I can say the movie was well done in a very limited manner depicting the realism of the racism of the south.  I believe the point was delivered and left room for the imagination to run wild.  The acting was excellent and provided excellent entertainment.  I would recommend to all.
B008UG0IS0|5.0|Gave this and &#34;Voice&#34; as a gift and recipient LOVED IT.  Fully met expectations!!!  A fresh sound in the house.  Thanks.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|Not a lot of depth in the story. Individual contestants other than star not well developed.  A lot of movie time wasted on improbable relationship.
B00A6HHJ9C|3.0|I love Steve Lukather don't get me wrong. He is one of my all-time favourite guitar players and I've now had the great pleasure of seeing him play live with Toto, G3 and Ringo Starr (where he basically drove the band). Unfortunately  Transition is just a little too similar to recent past efforts, All's Well and Everchanging. And like the former there are only 9 songs to sift through which seems to me to short-change the buyer. Musically there's no song I dislike.The title-track is probably the stand-out and Smile is a nice tune to finish on. It's just that I expected a bit more, both creatively and in terms of sheer content. Lukes first three solo efforts were brilliant on both those fronts and yet since then, oddly,with Toto winding down a degree or two on the creative front it appears to have transitioned (yes deliberate pun) into his solo stuff too. A little more effort next time wouldn't go astray but I will still await that next release with anticipation.
B0095MVOMC|4.0|I like this game so I gave it 4. For the price its O.K. it compairs to other like it. I just like them that have more to them.<br />But they keep me busy thinking. I tell others about them al the time.
B0098TL4YU|4.0|When Jimi Jamison replaced Dave Bickler in Survivor all those years ago I was concerned for the future of the band. Premonition , Eye and Caught were excellent examples of how to make a rock album: great lyrics, catchy riffs and a heavy back-beat. Then the singer is gone, replaced by somebody I'd never heard of. I needn't have worried. Once I heard the first line of I Can't Hold Back I knew the band would be okay. Pushing thirty years later Jamison still has one of the best voices in rock and in Erik Martensson he has found somebody outside the Survivor clique to harness that voice. As song-writer, producer and guitarist Martensson has captured the esscence of Jimi Jamison's talents. Never Too Late is to my ear almost a sequel to Too Hot to Sleep and if one didn't read the liner notes you would swear Jim Peterik and Frankie Sullivan were all over this. I won't rate each song individually. Just do yourself a favour especially if, like me, you were/are a Survivor fan and buy this. It fits into the collection very nicely.
B004I744AS|5.0|Best dictionary for the kindle fire hd. You can search for the word instead of flipping through the pages. The dictionary that came with the kindle you have to flip through the pages just to get to the word. So far it's the best one.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Best game ever worth $7.00 BEST APP EVER and a seed for it is &quot;pandaman&quot;<br />And a mod called pocket inv editor.dose work.I love this game there is no skin or texture maker!!!!!
1592402690|4.0|Think you've heard all the stories about the Beatles? Thing again. There's plenty in here that is new and compelling. Written by one of the most important Beatles' recording engineers, this book was an interesting read for this Beatles junkie. Geoff does a nice job of letting us know what was really going on in the studio when our boys made recording history. Some tasty tidbits: George Harrison was a very weak guitarist in the early days. John was nasty, moody, easily provoked even back then. George Martin was very protective and territorial about his position as producer: he expected everyone else involved in the technical side to take second place - and know their place. Many of the brilliant touches on the records were created by accident or the engineers; the Beatles deserve less credit than they've been given for some of them. Paul was a gentleman, kind, and the most talented (not much of a surprise).<br />I have a few quibbles: it seems unlikely that Geoff could remember so many of the conversations down to the very words that were said (it's been 50 years!); I think the author took some artistic license. But the result is very readable with a \\"you are there\\" feel to it. Thoroughly enjoyable!
B00AZ3027I|3.0|Archaic portrayal of women either doting over Peter, fighting over Peter or being used as a mother figure...literally.  Hard to love these messages being given to my daughter.  There are stronger, more positive heroines that have appeared in the more recent Disney films.  I much prefer the new and improved Tinkerbell.  I give it 3 stars because of the animation.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I so loved this book.  I could not put it down.  Can not wait for Holders story .  Highly recommend this book
B0084U0IEG|4.0|MAYBE IT IS BECAUSE THE WEATHER HERE HAS BEEN DISAPPOINTING I HAVE BEEN  DISAPPOINTED THAT I HAVE NOT REALLY FELL IN LOVE WITH ANY BOOK RECENTLY. SWEET TOOTH HAS MUCH TO OFFER AND I REALLY ENJOYED THE TALKS, INTERRUPTIONS OF THE TALKS, WHAT WAS GOING ON IN THE WORLD, LIVING THROUGH WHAT I LIVED THROUGH IN MY LIFE AT THAT TIME. HOWEVER, LIKE MANY &#34;OLD LADIES&#34; THERE WAS MUCH TOO MUCH SEX- IN AND OUT OF BED AND IN AND OUT OF PAST LOVERS. THE BOOK HAD ENOUGH TO OFFER IN THE WAY OF HISTORY, POLITICS, WORKING FOR A SECRET MISSION- ACTUALLY I FOUND THAT PART QUITE STRETCHED OF REALITY- BUT FOR A STORY IT WAS FUN. SOMEHOW MIXING WHAT REALLY HAPPENED WITH FICTION IS DIFFICULT AT BEST. THIS BOTHERED ME SOMEWHAT.
B00A1EOBJQ|4.0|Did not include song indicated on cellophane wrapper; otherwise ok.<br />Production values could be better & some of the songs are obscure.
B00BLCHYKU|2.0|Did not get engaged.  So So acting.  I doubt I will be back for more of this series except to &#34;give it another chance&#34;.
B004I744AS|4.0|Helps with homework fast and easy to use. Use it for all of my homework from English to science. Like I said earlier super easy to use.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this has way better graphics than temple run 1. probaby because of the turns and hills, or because of the powerups
0142424277|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite books, and as a teacher, I read it to my students every year.  It is funny and engaging and wonderfully pro-reading.  That is especially important in this, the age of screens.  Matilda is a brilliant and sensitive little girl trapped with a family of ignorant twits.  When she is finally able to go to school, her true potential is really unleashed.  Kids and adults alike will love this book.
1447211898|5.0|Anyone who enjoys historical novels will like this book.  It is interesting to &#34;see&#34; through the eyes of 4 different countries and cultures.
0679805273|5.0|Are you brainy and footsy? I received this book as a high school graduation present, and it's appropriate even today as an adult. In his typical exuberant and accessible fashion, Dr. Seuss becomes our personal cheerleader, urging us to get out there and do something and be successful. Its message reaches everyone at any stage in life, from young children all the way up to adults. We could all use a bit of extra encouragement, right?
B0049VZ222|5.0|thanks to this now I am all caught up can't wait for the new season to come back super excited!!!!!!!!
030758836X|5.0|Gone Girl is the story of Nick and Amy, a highly dysfunctional New York City couple who relocate to Nick's hometown in Missouri to care for his ailing parents.  Nick comes home one day to their \\"mcmansion on the river\\" to find his living room in a shambles and his wife gone.  The story is told through the alternating perspectives of Nick and Amy, going all the way back to the time they met up to present day.  I became a Gillian Flynn fan after reading Sharp Objects, and Gone Girl did not disappoint.  After reading these two books, I'm going to start calling her the Queen of F***ed Up Characters.  Her writing is crisp, clean and vivid, some of her prose reading like poetry.  After getting to know the characters through their history, the ending did not surprise me, but it also did not disappoint.  My recommendation would be to sit back and enjoy the ride and thank God for your own normalcy.
B005P4P966|5.0|This is the best season yet. I walk away with a sore gut every time I watch an episode from laughing so hard.
B00AB7HESI|1.0|come on you got to be kiddng me.  do the people know a kindle doe not have the ruturn button. I demand a updade that makes it so that you can place objects. if you do not in a week I demand a refund
B000FCKC4C|5.0|Easy to read and finish. It's always been a popular book, and I understand why. This is also a book that you can read more than once and learn more each time you read it, especially at different stages in your life.
0307456625|4.0|Entertaining, quick read. I will continue reading the series. Great for a &#34;fun&#34; book club read or to take to the pool.
B000FA675C|5.0|I love a book that's so good you can't put it down once you started. This is one of those books. I highly recommend it.
B006M4RN3U|3.0|there was only a few songs on this cd that i liked, but for the price i  wont complain. just ok
0553801473|5.0|I love Game of Thrones so I had to start reading the books. This one is the final one in the series. I love it so far. Lots of twists and turns.  The book is big enough that its easy to read the words. George RR Martin needs to write more of them!
B001RXB4FY|5.0|Volbeat is my new favorite band. they rock the house and also have some mellower songs that are heart felt,
B009FZHYKU|5.0|&#34;The Walking Dead&#34; is consistent in delivering quality over quantity on all fronts.  The writing, the casting, the incredible makeup, and the superlative acting all create a believable reality where the people are always fighting something.  They fight the walkers, they fight hunger and the elements, they fight between themselves and fight other groups who could be a threat.  Most of all, they fight themselves; they have to come to grips with the persons they used to be and the persons they have to be given the situation.  Some can't make the shift, like Dale.  Shane, on the other end of the spectrum, does whatever he thinks he has to to protect the group from threats as *he* perceives them.  These people constantly evolve trying to find the place within that keeps them from turning into someone like The Governor.  I particularly like that the writers leave no loose ends.  The strings may flap in the breeze for a bit, but they aren't lost.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I thought the book was super cute and an easy read. I would definitely suggest it as a beach read for summer. There is no over-the-top plot. It's a Harlequinn KISS about an overnight wedding, why would there be six subplots? The story was light and fun. I highly recommend it as a mini-escape. It takes about an hour and hour and a half to read.<br /><br />This title was FREE. Since it was free, you get what you pay for. You want six subplots, go read John Grisham or George RR Martin.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Tornado alley is where I live and AccuWeather kept me safe last night. Downloaded awhile ago, but never familiarized myself with it. As the storms rolled in last night, the television went down. Grabbed my Kindle Fire and made my way through AccuWeather real quick. I was amazed at all the different things available through this one app. Not only that, it was so easy to maneuver around-maps, severe warnings, breaking stories including live videos from coast-to-coast. Very thankful I have AccuWeather-available for only $0.99. I will always take it with me into the safety area in my home, and on the road!! I highly recommend AccuWeather!![[ASIN:B006LN9X08 AccuWeather]].
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|I own all of Josh's albums and this one did not disappoint. Although I am still getting familiar with all the songs on it,I do not doubt that I will thoroughly enjoy every song.
B007FJFDXS|3.0|This game was good for a few levels then couldn't get past a certain level game would not work.  Would be fun if it worked.
B004XUMMFE|4.0|This is a good series I was not sure at first but it is interesting. I am looking forward to watching the rest of the season.
B0093WVND4|5.0|I had to read this book in five days for a report and it was fun and easy, and school is not usually not fun and easy
B009IF8CH6|5.0|I love this show. It is one of the best shows out there in my opinion. It is like the new &#34;Friends&#34;
B007FRHZ4A|5.0|We haven't played the game much with this, more of just building and knocking down towers. My preschool day care kids love the digital game and i bought this thinking it would be a great way to get them into a game that wasn't digital.  They love building the towers on the cards and knocking them down, and it's great for motor skills as some of the block's edges aren't completely straight.
B005LAII12|5.0|was very funny, shipped quick and was a very good price, everyone wanted to borrow it, I recommend buying this movie
B00A80SHFM|5.0|I love the music from this movie!  I like this version better than some of the other ones I have seen.
B001GMQALY|5.0|Steamy, Erotic a look at a couple's journey that was almost like a roller coaster ride.  I saw this movie when it first came out and wanted to see it again. Story line I gave a B, but the characters and showing the heart beat of NYC scenes and Brooklyn Coney Island among  all the love and lust, I just enjoyed it A+.
B005NQ94KS|5.0|I really did like this one.  I like stories that cover a period of time as this one did.  It was different .
B00BHNQ5XK|3.0|Movie was okay, I only really enjoyed watching it that much because Ethan Hawke is my favorite actor.  Movie was a bit too predictable, soundtrack was eerie and fantastic.  Characters were great and in depth.  Story line B-.
B000NDIAWY|5.0|Most of the songs are really great.  Just a couple of them I am not too fond of hearing often!
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|love jimi awesome cd. i was so excited when it came out all the songs are bad. r i p
B003JTHXOK|3.0|I am a BIG fan of Nicholas Sparks, but this movie was not as good as some of them.  I really liked  &#34;The Lucky One&#34;!
B00B2G2RG6|4.0|It Is very well wrighten, I fell it was a bit graphic but in this day and age it is what most people want. Shock!!
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I just love this movie..the characters, the clothing, the whole time period. The cast is brilliant and the chemistry is almost tangible.
B007X70NVO|5.0|Very well produced and narrated. Would watch again, 10/10. Now I have to write more words to get to the minimum...
B009K0P10K|5.0|My favorite TV show right now! Thrilling, with endless unexpected twists and turns in the plot.  Really great acting and plot.  I wish the series would never end!
B0038OY6DW|5.0|The movie was fantastic. great performances by all. easy and fun to watch. would recommend it to all those who like some great wit and action.
B00AEFXKUI|5.0|I love this movie! I found it at a great price here! A great movie to add to my collection. Movie was brand new and arrived on time.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|fun to play and even the commercials are not too difficult to ignore. have much fun when I have the time to play
B00BAVQGS8|5.0|I bought this so I could play Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate and have two analog sliders. Whatever lead Nintendo not to add another slider to the 3DS XL, I'll never understand.<br /><br />Regardless, this product works great with the North American 3DS XL, despite being an import. It also came with a battery. Now I can use my bow / bowgun like a normal human being! All in all, I'm happy with the purchase.
B004I8WD7S|5.0|Love the price. I've had mine on my iPhone 4 for several months. Now my husband wants one too. Great gift.
0393088774|5.0|Great
B00280LYIC|5.0|I love love love this book! I remember when it first came out, it sounded stupid, so I didn't read it... big mistake. Best book ever!!
0385349947|5.0|I ordered this for my wife who was becoming frustrated with the boys club at work. She has yet to read the book but did draw some strength from watching the interview tour that accompanied the book. As soon as tax season is officially over she plans to read ASAP. The package,with free shipping, arrived sooner than I expected and even sooner than they predicted. A+ all around.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I love this movie, these actors really know what they're doing.  The teeming scenery of India is fascinating along with the a story that is well written and excuted.  You don't want to miss this one.  AAAA++++
B009UX2YAC|3.0|This is a really fun game and I enjoy playing it. I love all the characters and how the game is going on a world tour.  However it did glitch a little. And too many ads pop up!!
B000N4SHOE|5.0|Thanks so much for the timely delivery and safe packaging of this DVD.  I LOVE this movie, it is one of my favorites.  The sets and scenery are beautiful, not to mention the history of one of the most famous childrens authors in the history of mankind.  Great buy.  AAAAAAA+++++ without a doubt.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Tells you all you need to know about uploading your book.  Plus it's free so no reason not to get.
B009ZQ8FQG|3.0|I so enjoyed Downton Abbey season one and two. I did like season three but it has taken on more of a soap opera feel.
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|I saw it in 3D at the Cinema and I was Blown away......? Where is the 3D release Date.....? If no 3D = no Buy......
B0019N95IK|2.0|OK , WHY MISLEADING US AGAIN IN SAYING THINGS LIKE BREATHTAKING HIGH DEFINITION 1080P PICTURE IF IN TRUTH THE PICTURE QUALITY IS PREETY BAD WITH NO REMASTER DONE AT ALL...? I FINISHED WITH THE VERY FIRST EPISODE AND I WAS VERY DISSAPOINTET ABOUT THE PICTURE QUALITY....? WHY NO CRISTAL CLEAR PICTURE LIKE STOS OR TNG FIRST SEASON....? BACKROUND WAS VERY FUZZY YOU COULD NOT READ ANYTHING AT THE BACKROUND, FRONT PICTURE WAS OK BUT NOT CRISTAL CLEAR , NO CLEAN PICTURE ON THE WHOLE EPISODE...? SEEMS TO ME THEY TOOK THE DVD PICTURE AND PUT IT ON BLU-RAY WITHOUT SUPER CLEAN RESTORATION....? I WILL UPDATE THIS AFTER WATCHING MORE EPISODES BUT SO FAR NO DIFFRENCES BETWEEN DVD AND THIS REMASTER 2013 BLU-RAY ?  ???????? THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE AN EASY RESTORATION SINCE IT WAS THE LAST OF ALL STAR TREK SERIES AND IT WAS RECORDED IN DIGITAL FORM AT THE TIME SO WHAT WAS / IS THE PROBLEM...? SO WHY IS THE PICTURE NOT AS GOOD AS TNG FIRST SEASON OR AT LEAST LIKE THE ORIGINAL 60S STAR TREK SERIE.....? MAN IM ANGRY ? BTW IM WATCHING IT ON MY SONY HD-3D PROJECTOR ON MY 4m SCREEN WITH OPPO BLU-RAY PLAYER? IF THE PICTURE IS NOT IMPROVING ON NEXT VIEW EPISODES STICK WITH YOUR DVD COPIES....
B005HSGB6W|5.0|This book is a killer insight into the human mind's lust to never bored and to be always going on to something more.
B005KELR3A|4.0|I bought this sleeve for my mom when she got her first Kindle. Clean design, well constructed, and keeps her Kindle safe. She doesn't actually travel with her Kindle but uses it at home, however she doesn't like leaving it out of the case because too many things can happen (like something getting spilled or it, or knocked off a counter, or her rat terrier jumping on the desk and deciding to read his favorite dog book!)
B008I43DYU|2.0|It will not change to the landscape feature, which is where I need to be when I am doing my math problems
B002UNMW7O|3.0|Movie was delivered on time & in good shape upon receipt.<br />However, after seeing it, I wish it hadn't been. The last 20-30 minutes was good, the rest of it falls FAR short of the original for my taste.<br />Watched it once & probably never will again.
B00B7IJBUY|5.0|Another great collection by Bon Jovi!<br />Many songs on the CD will be in your head soon!<br />Highly recommend it!
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Really was excited to get the dvd of this movie!  Can't wait for the next 2 parts of this series to complete the story!<br />Have already viewed the dvd several times.  It's a fun movie...
B00BHHIWQO|1.0|Don't like it.  more words required hat that when I have already said I don't like the game.  so there
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|Ang Lee is a genius, that's really all you need to know about any of his films. I would watch an Ang Lee movie about garbage collection.
B009EAO38C|5.0|Excellent musicians, nice twists on some classic and classical stuff. Nice combo of piano and cello. Can't wait for more.
B003730LRY|5.0|I just love this movie. It's funny and it's a great movie for the whole family to watch together. Thanks
B004742Y68|5.0|I love scary movies like this. Something that gets you and it's not gross to look at. I love scary not gory
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|watched it twice wish amazon had more newer movies to watch and got them before netflix I would be on the site more
B009WO7NQO|1.0|Also why the free version we see is not available for the Kindle Fire?? This is some arbitrary, money-grabbing move from greedy Amazon. For shame...
B008KGPEQG|2.0|I purchased this for a book club, and found it excruciatingly boring, depressing and pointless. Yes, we did discuss the book, but the general consensus at the table was:  Not worth reading.  Apparently,  this author has written many books and is highly regarded. I have not read any of his other books.
B0044C3RB4|5.0|I highly recommend this series. The best part is being able to watch one episode right after the other instead of when it was on TV and you had to wait a whole week. The writing is sharp and the characters especially Walter are great. I had been originally skeptical of the 2 universe thing but the writers have handled it so well. The 2 universe story line reminds me of China Mieville's book &#34;The City and The City&#34; if you want to read a good sci-fi mystery book too.
B009ZQ8FQG|1.0|EPISODE FREEZES AFTER FIRST MINUTE OF INTRODUCTION.  TRYING TO PLAY ONLINE BUT VIDEO WILL NOT CONNECT QUICKLY OR ACCURATELY .
B002BFBAUG|5.0|Although I wouldn't say that it's your traditional comedy, it's definitely funny while developing a coming of age story for our main character.  I rewatch this all the time.
B002DOSBMK|5.0|Literally starting with Drizzt's birth, the reader gets a very detailed description of Menzoberranzan and what it's like to grow up in the Underdark.  Strongly recommended to Drizzt fans and general fantasy lovers alike.
B005J3IEZQ|5.0|Gives you a perspective about the tech revolution that began in the late 70s with the advent of personal computer, not to mention the insight into what drove Steve Jobs to pioneer great consumer products
B0090P98Z4|5.0|Fun<br />I like this one it is kind of like dungeon siege.  I have not played many games I like but this is fun.
B008602KQI|5.0|I had shied away from this movie because of all the teenage hype, fearing that it might fall into a teen-pandering genre liek those vampire flicks (ugh). Instead, I found a well written, well acted, well directed/edited masterpiece.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|My daughter and I saw this movie as a free screening a few months ago.  She loved it so much that she wanted to rent it again.
0385349831|5.0|This book is one to whole heartedly share with everyone.  In fact, with all of the fear about the future we are facing today, this manuscript is a must.  The souls of this entire world need to ingest this divinely inspired masterpiece and live its values.
0718178122|4.0|It's no surprise to read that this novel started life as a screenplay (still unfilmed).  It's a romcom gem, light hearted and occasionally laugh out loud funny - a heartwarming romance between two mismatched individuals.<br /><br />The narrator, Don, is a genetics professor who as he puts it is \\"wired differently\\".  While no specific diagnosis is offered, he has many characteristics commonly associated with Asperger's.  Don is in his late 30s and has never been married.  He develops a sixteen-page questionnaire in a bid to identify his ideal match.  Among the requirements are that she loves maths, is a non-smoker, doesn't drink, is strictly punctual and enjoys a varied diet.  Into his life comes Rosie, a beautiful lady with her own hangups who meets precisely none of his criteria (Think Jennifer Lawrence in [[ASIN:B00A81MV3U Silver Linings Playbook]]).  Rosie needs help finding her genetic father and Don agrees to assist her.  It's a romcom - of course you know what's going to happen! - but it comes together in an original and very funny way.  Along the way Don will discover new talents, from the trivial (mastering the instructions for every cocktail known to man) to the profound (learning to discern sub-texts in conversations).<br /><br />It took me a little while to get into this book.  Initially I felt that Don's personality \\"issues\\" were overdone and that the same jokes were being rehashed.  However as Rosie becomes a central character, it really takes off.  This book made me laugh out loud (which hardly ever happens when I'm reading) and it made me smile.  It's a delight.
B00433TO52|1.0|The spacial formatting in the Kindle edition is horrible.  In the plays, the indenting or offsetting of the character vs. the line is almost random.  I returned it within ten minutes.
B004EPZ03O|5.0|After watching a bunch of the old Muppet episodes this movie makes for a lot of fun.  I think it can stand on it's own, but you should really get acquainted with the old crew again.  It is ten times better than the first Muppet movie.
B0081336FO|5.0|Sherlock is a great BBC series. My family can't wait until season 3 begins.  Seasons 1and 2 are worth watching.

B004X60QE2|1.0|Please, dear Lord! -- open my dulled senses, so that I might reclaim whatever it is I seem to be lacking (assuming I ever had it in the first place), in order to fully apprehend what on earth it is that countless perspicacious viewers purport to find so praiseworthy and enjoyable about this bodacious crap.<br /><br />Two hours into Season One of EUREKA had me squinting in disbelief at the dimwitted implausibility of the plot...the fatuous dialogue...the psuedo-scientific mumbo-jumbo...the grating voice of Colin Ferguson...the rehearsal-like acting on the part of the show's flesh-and-blood mannequins -- in short, just about everything.<br /><br />Science fiction at its horrendous worst!
B002RI9YCI|4.0|This is a wonderfully witty and literate paean to the joys of reading, captured in a delightful, gentle send-up of royalty.
B003VANOFY|1.0|First pair of wireless for me.  I DO NOT recommend these to any one.  Out of the box the mic had a 1/2 second delay when talking into it.  Had to go into msconfig to get it to work properly.<br /><br />During listening I get pops and it cuts out about every 5-15 minutes during games and music.  This has been a know issue with Logitech for a long time and nothing really fixes it.  Most people say its a problem using with Windows 7 64 bit.<br /><br />If I can find another set of Sirus Storm Cooler Master corded headset, these will be going back.
B004WGIXX4|1.0|I found this movie to be very relevant to the problems todays society face in our lack of commitment to each other and to any concept of what is moral and wrong.
B00C1TOTK0|5.0|Shane is widely regarded as one of the finest American films ever made, and makes virtually every list of the top ten westerns. Inspired by the Johnson County War, an actual incident in the area around Casper, Wyoming in 1892, Shane is re-located to the stunningly scenic Jackson Hole area in the northwest corner of the state. Here the days of the open range are coming to an end, and homesteaders are establishing small farms and ranches --- and building fences. This does not sit well with the few large cattle ranchers, who determine to push the settlers out, violently if necessary.<br /><br />These are not the cardboard characters so typical of many early westerns. The farmers are not all resolute, sober and hard-working; and the ranchers' viewpoint is presented as not being entirely due to villainy, but rather to their perception of precedence and sacrifice that gives them superior rights. Into this contested landscape rides Shane, Alan Ladd in his best role of a long career. He is quiet, with a ready smile, but with a tightly coiled inner tension created by his life's experiences, which are only hinted at. Seldom has a film outlined its narrative elements so clearly and so quickly. Within the first ten minutes you know the protagonists on both sides, and the stakes of winning or losing. You also learn as much as you will ever know about Shane's history, from his reaction to hearing the cocking of a rifle.<br /><br />In Germany, Shane is known as \\"My Great Friend Shane\\", based on the hero worship by Joey, the farm boy played by Brandon deWilde in an Academy Award nominated role. The boy's parents are portrayed by Van Heflin and Jean Arthur. At the age of 50, Arthur came out of retirement at the request of director George Stevens and very believably acted the part of a woman in her early 30s. Another Academy Award nomination went to Jack Palance, in only his third film role, as the hired gun Wilson.<br /><br />High Noon, filmed and released in 1952, is often considered to be the ground-breaking \\"modern\\" western. But Shane was filmed a year earlier, in 1951, obsessively edited by George Stevens for almost a year during 1952, and finally released in 1953. Upon its release it was promoted by Paramount Studios as the first \\"widescreen\\" movie, neglecting to mention the early experiments of 1930. Shane was not filmed in the widescreen format of 1.66 to 1, but in the standard \\"Academy ratio\\" of 1.37 to 1, then masked in the projector to change its shape to 1.66 and \\"zoomed\\" to fill the screen. This process resulted in the loss of almost one-fifth of the image, but the public didn't seem to mind because the novelty of widescreen was exciting.<br /><br />Cinematographer Loyal Griggs won the 1953 Academy Award for his photography, and to lose nearly 20% of the meticulously composed images would be tragic. The new Blu-ray high definition restoration of Shane, released in August of 2013, restores not only the color and the clarity of the film, but also the undiminished full image. This is a great restoration of a superb film on the occasion of its sixtieth anniversary, bringing new life to an old classic.
B0054SMIH6|5.0|Matthew McConaughey was incredible. Nice plot that turns the tables around. Definitely worth watching this movie, I enjoyed it greatly.
B004CLYKLI|5.0|Just a quick review as I catch a break from my 3 little ones.  I was curious to read this book for our book club this month.  After all, I am Asian and was curious how Amy would portray our upbringing and bring a positive light to it.  There were many times in the book, where I could hear my own mother saying those same exact words to me.  Amy was a little more extreme than what I consider a &#34;typical Asian&#34; upbringing, but look at what her children accomplished!  In the Asian culture, it is all about results.  Many of my friends believed that this robbed Amy's children of a childhood (Or any other child raised in this manner).  I was raised in a a very similar manner to this book.  But, I look back and remember a beautiful childhood.  I don't resent my mother for being so strict.  In fact, I am grateful.  I would not have achieved half of what I have accomplished, if she had not pushed or taught me to work hard for it.  You will either hate or love this book.  5 stars for me!
0812550706|5.0|This is an incredible book from page 1 until the last word.  It grabs you right away and you can't put it down until you're done.  It's one of those books that you feel like you enter this world and while you are reading it you keep thinking about it, you go to bed and you dream you are in the war exercises.  My brother-in-law hates to read, yet he couldn't put the book down! Highly recommend!

B001XUIBNO|3.0|If you want to just veg-out and watch a movie- this isn't it. Several plot twists make you think some- some deal with rather &#34;messed-up&#34; story lines. A good movie when you want to pay attention. Jack was pretty good looking guy b when he was younger.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Excellent product. Easy to use and has titles I could not find elsewhere. I will gladly recommend to family and friends.
B008Y7N7JW|2.0|Okay- I'll admit I'm probably not the intended demographic for this movie- way too predictable and a lot of elements taken for other movies. But then again I'm over 50....

B002ZG974M|5.0|My daughter (2yrs) fell in love with this movie and the antics of these babies. I was pregnant and used every opportunity to show her what having a new baby would be like. She had an understanding of quiet naps, silly baby faces/noises, crying, bathtimes, and breastfeeding.<br />Best of all it was really a cultural experience. There was no agenda to make one family better. They were all loving, involved, and made us smile.

B00BJS7LHC|5.0|This is the story of an African man enslaved in the South of the United States, not long before the start of the Civil War and freed by a German dentist turned a bounty hunter, to help him kill white men, who are wanted by the law.<br /><br />In this movie, a Pollack art pops out to a van Gogh background with the movement of the Fountains of Bellagio, in blood. Quentin Tarantino, the genius behind the screenplays of Pulp Fiction, Inglourious Basterds, and now Django, where the `D' is silent, is the latest in the crescendo of a career that is still flying to greater heights to audiences' delight.<br /><br />Two years before the Civil War, 1858, in the South, humans, who were forcibly kidnapped from Africa were traded in auction blocks. One such African, named Django (Jamie Foxx), will do anything to find the woman he loves.  Her name is Broomhilda (Kerry Washington). Django is freed by a German dentist-turned-bounty-hunter named Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz), who is willing to help Django find his woman. In exchange for Django's help for Schultz to hunt down certain men who are wanted. That is the main artery of the story.<br /><br />The tributaries of the story make for a wholesome, grotesque, horrific and sometimes stupendously (\\"Speak English, goddamit!\\") funny moments. A case in point is when Spencer `Big Daddy' Bennett (Don Johnson) has a KKK-like group with white hoods over their heads are on their way to capture our hero, Django; they spend a long time struggling with the eye-holes on their hoods to see more clearly. The scene maybe funny, but also acts as a sad metaphor for much of the South struggling a long time with their eye-holes. It would take a long time for the South to synch up with the \\"more enlightened area\\" of the United States, the North. The good doctor gives a quick astronomy lesson every chance he gets by pointing to the North Star for any freedom-loving person to follow.<br /><br />The climax of the movie is when Django and the doctor arrive at Calvin Candie's plantation. Candie's  brilliantly played by Leonardo DiCaprio. The scene in which Candie first appears is where two Africans are fighting to death in Candie's livingroom.<br /><br />This movie is unmistakably Tarantino-esque at its best.rive at Calvin Candie's plantation.

B003U4ZQRK|5.0|Hello, This is an excellent series.  Great acting, writing and directing it is an excellent series.  I thought it would be a survivor type show but it is nothing of the sort.  It is a great mystery, one that has your eyes glued to the screen.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This game is aiight much like sim city but not as good still needs a few kinks worked out as well .
B003M6FGTE|5.0|This is a fun show with a great idea, combining acting, dance and singing.  At first I thought I would not like it but I throughly enjoy it.  It is a new and refreshing idea for TV.

B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Tom Clancy at his best! Hard to find the difference between truth or fiction. Kept me up nights until I finished! I'd highly recommend<br />reading this book.
B003U51D58|4.0|This season probably wasn't as good as the previous seasons due to the story lines going in weird directions.  That being said, the recording quality was very good and it's definitely worth watching to finish the series.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I started watching this series recently and from the pilot episode, I was hooked!  The storyline and characters are so awesome!  I can't wait till next season!!
B00005NG9Z|5.0|if you like alice in chains you will love the dvd. i didn't remember how dark there videos were but that's part of why they are so good. and for the price you cant go wrong with the purchase.
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|I really bought this movie for my son for Easter.  He has been watching the Lord of the Rings movies over and over so I was thrilled that the Hobbit was finally out on DVD.  I have to be honest, I have only watched a little bit of the movie here and there, but what I have seen has been enjoyable.  I like that this movie has some of the same actors in it as the earlier filmed movies-Gandalf and Frodo-and there are new arrivals as well.  The movie also seems to stick with the book The Hobbit for the most part from what I can remember.  I read that book when I was in high school I think-which was a LONG time ago so it's a stretch, but little things from the movie spark my memories.  Anyway, my son enjoys this movie and since it was purchased for him, that's all that matters.  It does have violent battle scenes and scary creatures like the other LOTR movies, so it might not be good for some.
1416550534|5.0|This paperback arrive in mint condition except a persons name written on inside of cover.  I would highly recommend this novel if you love english adventures!
B007REV4YI|5.0|I totally dig Daniel Craig as James Bond.  I also like that this James Bond movie doesn't belittle women or create an ultra sexy &#34;Bond girl&#34;.  I know, I know...that's what makes James Bond, James Bond, but this is a good action movie, and a good 007 edition.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This is a great game very addictive and my daughter loves it she isn't old enough to play it but she enjoys watching her favorite ponys interact
B00B2TTVNU|5.0|Ok ... This CD has simply rendered me speechless. Hearing Rachmaninov's concertos in such good quality, with Valentina's incredible interpretation and a top-notch orchestra ...<br /><br />Do you all know how lucky you are to have this opportunity?! This CD is a must-buy if there ever was one.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|I chose this book because I liked Nelson DeMille's previous book The Lion Game.  This one was just okay and I certainly got tired (very quickly) of the main character, John Corey's, sense of humor. Enough of his wise cracks already...
B0091REZMW|4.0|This game works great on my Kindle Fire. I really enjoy that it keeps me entertained for quite awhile before I run out of energy.  I would like some of the tasks to be a little easier  to attain.
B00BRYDKM8|5.0|This e-book has all the elements you'd expect: great examples, top expert opinion, and straightforward tips for delivering an excellent talk. Akash Karia keeps things simple, and the result is a very readable and eminently useful guide.
B001EC2ISA|5.0|If you were a kid in the late 80's/early 90's chances are that you grew yp with this movie. Pretty much every character, every song & evrry scene is memorable. Michael Keaton's high energy & perverted jokes is obviously what makes the movie funny but the over all feel to the movie was something so original at the time & cannot really be compared to any other movie still today. It truely is a Tim Burton masterpiece, a classic & a must own for any dvd collection.
B00064X3FE|4.0|Just got this SACD and it is now my 5th EJ SACD.  Although the remastering is a tad bright and despite the fact they've raised the overall volume and thus reduced the dynamic range, this album sounds great, especially in 5.1.  For sure it beats the goosed and overly-tweaked Gus Dudgeon 95 remasters.  If you have SACD playback and surround sound capability, I highly recommend picking this one up.  While I do wish they had simply done a flat transfer, the use of surround sound is done so well, I can accept the louder overall sound.  I'm glad that there are still artists like Elton that can appreciate SACD and want to leave a legacy of thier catalog on this high-rez format.  Amazed that they're even still putting out SACDs as I believe there is only one SACD pressing plant left and thats in Austria.<br /><br />Going to give this 4 out of 5 stars only because of the slight loss of dynamic range.  Still well worth the buy!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I hope this author plans on writing a sequel.  I enjoyed the book, as did most of the members of my book club.

0988178532|5.0|Gripping, fast paced suspense thriller, with a metaphysical focus. Loved reading this book and looking forward to the rest of the story in the upcoming trilogy.
B004GCPJDQ|1.0|I just got off the phone with square trade, and even though Amazon is offering a 2 year warranty by Square Trade for an additional $3.99 -- it is NOT covered by them. Since it does not have its own external power (it is powered by USB) and because it is considered an \\"accessory\\" to the magic mouse, they will not cover it under warranty. I have this item, purchased from amazon, and not only am I having the issue where the battery pack does not fit in properly, the item itself has also stopped charging fully. The mouse continues to link and unlink from the computer even after a full day of charge. I will still buy this item in hopes that it was just a malfunctioning unit... or I might just say screw it and go back to batteries as they are more dependable. I just have to make sure I always have a pair in the desk at work.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|fantastic loved the movie GREAT thanks, great acting and I can see why this won the movie of the year for 2012 - excellent.
B005H9B44A|4.0|Thor has LOTS of action and special effects: fierce weather, fighting with both crude and magical weapons, a futuristic portal to different worlds. And there is the standard romantic subplot. Plus, the film introduces Viking mythology with a different spin. If all those things appeal to you, then you should enjoy watching Thor. If you demand something more intellectual, then maybe not.
0345803485|1.0|Trash I am not sure how this sold so many copies it was poor writing and certainly sick sick sick......... sad that this got so much publicity and that the writer received so much from the books - best place for this is in the garbage bin - sorry
B005HEPIDS|5.0|This is the year everything came together.... well unfortunately.  It's the year it all ended as well.  Although it was good to see them make it back to earth... I wish they would have them still on their journey.  It was an anti-climactic ending.
B0047SF41G|3.0|The movie has a strong start and a good sense of pacing and the introduction of some different looks Predator as well as some dog like creatures made for a fin idea. But about halfway through things start to feel rushed towards a predictable climax. Adrien Brody was excellent  in this and really shows his broad range.g. Topher Grace on the other hand seems miscast and in my opinion seems to play pathetic too easily.
B007NCTWX4|5.0|This album provides a range of diverse experiences -- the jazzy obsessive \\"Mine,\\" the happy guitar-filled \\"Penguin,\\" and the ever-dramatic and confrontational \\"Jar of Hearts.\\" Christina's duet with Jason Mraz on \\"Distance\\" creates a gentle mix of their voices on this sad track.<br /><br />This was the first Christina Perri music I've owned. I purchased this album, because a friend kept a copy in her car, and I got very tired of humming the tunes to myself at home, but not having the artist's music on hand to play. \\"Jar of Hearts\\" tempted me to download the single, but I am glad I went for the entire album. Christina's voice can be soothing or strike deep in the heart.<br /><br />The \\"deluxe\\" album offers four bonus tracks, two videos, and a booklet. The videos and booklet are features I ignore, but bonus songs -- especially so many -- are worth having.<br /><br />Artist: Christina Perri<br />Contributer: Jason Mraz<br />Date: 2011<br />Songs: 16<br />Videos: 2<br />Booklet: Yes<br /><br />More Christina:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0049XMQ2O the ocean way sessions]]<br /><br />More Jason Mraz:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B007QNRMUU Love Is A Four Letter Word]]
B005LJITS0|4.0|Watching this movie I realized that after Batman and Superman I really don't have a grasp of the DC Nation. I know who the characters are and their basic powers but I don't really know how they operate. Does the Green Lantern really make &#34;lantern constructs&#34; all the time in the books? Reynolds does a good job as Hal Jordan although I always read Jordan as a lot more serious then portrayed here; but you feel for the character and he is believable. The alien threat and the Green Lantern Corps are done excellent and I would be excited for a sequel with more space adventures.

B0073XORCY|5.0|Ian still rocks!  This is better when you read the story line behind it, another great one from Ian!!!  The music is definitely &#34;Tull&#34;esque&#34;, and any fan needs this, JUST BUY IT!!!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|LOVE the Walking Dead! Always a very entertaining show with a storyline that has a great cast of characters...great job!
B005CRY2O6|5.0|This is a beautiful cookbook to own - best recipes with innovative vegetarian options and the pictures are very appetizing and tempting.
0525478817|5.0|Absolutely love this book!! I laughed, I cried. I laughed until I cried. It's so beyond what I was expecting. After reading numerous reviews about this book on blogs, I finally caved and bought it. Best thing I've ever done. Well, book buying wise.<br /><br />The seriousness of Hazel's illness threw me off track of the obvious. (I shall not spoil) I cried and cried because this book is heartbreaking, but yet so much more. It's about life and death, love and happiness, family and friends.<br /><br />This is the second John Green book I've read. Once again, he pulled me in and made me think hard. Forget about everything but this book. That in itself, is genius. I'd recommend this book for anyone to read. This is not just a YA novel, it's every genre. Worth every second of your time and money.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|IMahjong Deluxe is a fun , relaxing game (unless you are trying to go fast to see how many stars you can get).
B00BSBT8M6|3.0|The beginning of the film is very long before the film starts. this film could be 30 minutes shorter and still be good.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Love Firefly.  My only complaint is that they didn't have more episodes.  I really enjoyed the movie too.  Highly recommended.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|The story line of Lincoln's and his political ally's efforts to get the 13th amendment passed before the end of the Civil War is mesmerizing. The portrayals by the actors made you feel like you were there. Of course, while this is history - there is no way to know the actual dialogs that happened, or the validity of all the sights and sounds of the time period. However, everything was presented in a fashion that it feels like every word, sight and sound did happen exactly that way. From the history I'm familiar with, this is also representative of what happened during that tumultuous time. The movie time wise is long, but it doesn't feel long while you are watching.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|this works exactly as expected.  you can't go wrong if you make this purchase.<br />I would recommend anyone looking for this sort of thing, should give it a go!
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I have never played any Mahjong before this game. I like playing the game, fun finding the matching pieces and discovering that flowers an matched also worked.
B0096PYUE2|5.0|this works exactly as expected.  you can't go wrong if you make this purchase.<br />I would recommend anyone looking for this sort of thing, should give it a go!
B003M6EAXM|5.0|24 is probably my favorite series of all time. I really enjoy it! You will want to keep watching episode after episode, so get ready for some sleepless nights.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I enjoyed this book.Each chapter kept my interest some parts serious others pretty funny and of coarse sensual.<br />I also liked the characters the author invented.
B0074AGVWK|4.0|Typical Maeve story real people you can identify with, facing the daily problems that families everywhere do. The story is set against the harsh backdrop of the current tough financial times where job security is a thing of the past. Coupled with insensitive ault children it is a good read.
B001ENS0BI|5.0|After a somewhat slow season 3 with an awkward storyline, the authors complete the show in entertaining fashion. I loved watching this series on Amazon.
0800141849|5.0|I thought it had a very good meaning to it. Because no matter who we are as females sucessful or NOT. It matters SO MUCH THAT WE MUST LIKE OUR SELVES. We dont have to be vain but by eating right foods and excercising sure helps you like yourself. And say hey Im okay. And my jeans go on. And I tell u its a great feeling. To realise that we dont have to settle for less. That we are worth it...
B0012HRJEA|3.0|I like how the director incorporated modern influences in order to grab the attention of people who may not be so much into Shakespeare, however some of the delivery was all wrong. Maybe it's because I am an English Teacher and a literature nerd, but some aspects to this movie were just bad.<br />MAJOR parts of the play were simply cut, MAJOR parts were changed, and some parts were just confusing. I mean, why does Mercutio have to dress up in drag? What is the purpose of that whole scene? And how can Romeo not get a simple letter from the Friar if they have cars?!<br /><br />On the other hand, there is just something about this movie. Parts of it were so watchable, you fell in love with certain characters again because of their passion, and you walked away thinking 'ok that was kind of a neat concept'. Maybe it had something to do with a young Leo Dicaprio....<br /><br />Overall, it's just okay. I see what the director was trying to accomplish, but there were many different ways he could have done it. Yes, all movies made from books, plays, etc leave out aspects, but this one left out important details that completely changed the tone. Characters who did play larger parts in the play only played minor parts, and I really think some of the modern influences took away from overall quality of the movie.
B005K17RU0|5.0|wonderful app. very accurate. allows to add locations all over the world and in different degrees. wonderful tool for who travels.... just great!
B008IBPMZG|5.0|What can I say, I love this series.  All the plotting, scheming set in that beautiful castle just lures me in.  The show is great fun.
B0036TGT3E|5.0|You just can't go wrong with The Lion King.  It's funny, heartwarming, and has a great soundtrack.  Absolutely awesome for kids and adults.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I can't say enough good things about this book. It's one of those books that has such great characters that I'm still thinking about them 3 weeks after I read it. Great book.
B0018BZEOC|5.0|This movie is fantastic.  Anyone who believes in any higher being should watch this movie.  Funny, smart, and entertaining.  It really puts religion in perspective and makes some fabulous points about religion.
B008JMKN4Y|2.0|I think I’m the only person on my GoodRead’s list that has read this book and didn’t fall in love with it. Maybe it’s because I read, mostly, adult books filled with lots of sex, but thought this whole book I keep saying to myself “I am reading the vanilla teen version of Fifty Shades of Grey!”<br /><br />At first I liked Travis. Most girls have a thing for a bad boy with tattoos, sadly. I even liked the whole “act like you aren’t interested and immediately they will become interest” because that s*** is real! I loved how Abby wasn’t affected by him. Then she caved. And instead of me being like “Oh, wow, he’s changing for her” I was like “This s*** is getting creepy… FAST”! He is on the fast track to becoming a wife beater and/or murder. Like, about 70% of the time I was reading, I was just picturing Mark Wahlberg in Fear. I’m seeing all these poles where girls are voting him “hottest book boyfriend” and now that I’ve finally read this I’m over here like “WUT!?” Travis = Bats***. End of story! PS – Pigeon is the stupidest nickname ever! (It had to be said!) Stage three creeper things Travis did off the top of my head: 1) trashed the apartment and ripped the door from the hinges the night after she gave him her virginity (Anna Steel Style), 2) The tattoos, 3) The grabbing her ass while staring down other guys interested in Abby, 4) Redecorating his room with pictures and items from times with her (FEAR STYLE, AGAIN), 5)Having a wedding ring picked out, just chilling in your night stand 6) Beating up everyone in a killer like manner that so much as hints about his little pigeon in a negative light.<br /><br />Abby, oh Abby where do I even begin with you? At first I liked you, I really did. How did you slip so far? She would get upset over the most stupid things, then contemplate going back with him (after he stepped way over the bats*** bar) and then he’d act normal and she wouldn’t be interested. I was so confused through have the book. I am a girl, and I went to college, and I dated lots of guys. I have never even heard of a girl acting like this. I just think she is a masochist that likes to cry and be in pain. Then the whole time I’m thinking it’s because of her big dark secret! Then it surfaces: She’s the daughter of a famous poker player who went broke and blames her. Again… WUT?! And I couldn’t have been the only person to think she was ALWAYS going to get pregnant every time they had sex, either!<br /><br />I thought the author wrote well, and this book was a very easy read, but it should have taken place in a high school instead of college. Even at a small private college rumors do not circulate like that. People do not always eat lunch together, at the same lunch table, in the same seats, every day in college. Especially the “I sit at the table with the football players” s***! My lord. And what kind of school has this underground fight club where tons of people show up and a tatted up bad boy who is constantly beating everyone who looks at his best friend/girlfriend into a bloody pulp, and NEVER have any cops/teachers/author figures at all notice?<br /><br />My biggest problem with this story is I really never knew what direction the story was supposed to go it. I think if she would have ended the story at the 40% mark, it would have been a cute little story that high school girls swoon over. Sexy bad boy, smart girl that doesn’t give in the peer pressure and have sex with him, fun friends, cute parties, smart girl shows bad boy there is more than sex and that love is better, the get together, the end. But no no no, after the 40% mark I was thinking that 1) she was going to get pregnant and make this into a lifetime movie real quick, or 2) he was going to snap and kill someone and go to jail, then 3) he was going to get a tattoo that says “PIGEON 4-EVA” on his chest, kidnap her, and the whole time while torturing her he would mutter to himself “if I can’t have you no one will!”<br /><br />The best part of the whole book was when Abby got close with Travis’ family, his father especially. The whole “mommy issue” he has is very sad and tugged at my heartstrings. It also explained to me why he is so bats***, where Abby really doesn’t have an excuse. But the Thanksgiving at this house was one of my favorite parts of the whole book.<br /><br />One last thing, I could not have been the only one that thought that tattoos where almost the craziest thing in the book? I love tattoos, I am very attracted to men with tattoos, but if I dated a guy for a few weeks and he got a tattoo about me, I would see that as a red flag. I thought she did too, but she got an even creepier tattoo! The ending felt so thrown together and rushed it was unreal to me. The wedding really did come out of left field. I hated how she picked Vegas after that whole stupid side story, when she could have just as easy gone to a courthouse. Then she didn’t invite his family or her friends? They couldn’t wait two days? It was just the bats***cherry on this whole crazy sundae.k was when Abby got close with Travis’ family, his father especially.

B008YWY0HK|5.0|A charming animated Family film about things Scottish, with excellent voice over acting by Billy Connoly and many others..<br />Also features an independent female Heroine, rather than a &#34;Hero&#34;,  a reconciliation of a mother and daughter at odds with<br />one another, etc.  Enjoyable for adults and chicldren...
B00C1BUYX4|4.0|A significant portion of the show concentrates on the actions taken to pass the 13th ammendment and his second term in the White House.
B00B0YL0E0|5.0|How has this amazing band eluded me for so long?  I regret that I haven't spent most of my life listening to them.  There is not a bad song on this album, seriously.  If you have never heard of Pretty Maid before, try them.  This is just pure, concentrated awesomeness!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I enjoy all of the angry bird games.  This one takes a little more time to play than the Space game.
B004LWZW88|5.0|Great Story, Great Voices (antonio banderas), great animation, great addition to my grandkids/ visiting kids collection<br />Worth being part of any collection
B008YKGQR4|5.0|I haven't had any problems with this app.  It's really user friendly.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to others.
B004EPYZV2|3.0|While although not the greatest of the &#34;series&#34; not the worst either.  The cinematography was excellant but some parts were to far unbelievable.  Which is just like the old television show :)
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|This a sweet flick about the fairy tale guardians that protect our children's imaginations. In real life, there is the tendency to smother the very nature of a child's imagination. This movie reminds us about all the glorious possibilities an imagination can have.
B005ZKYXZI|5.0|Story was not what I originally expected, but I really liked the idea when it took off.  Hugh Jackman did a great job, and the kid with him the connection between the two was heartwarming as well.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I LOVED this book!  In face, I LOVED all the books of &#34;Gray&#34;.  Some of the details of their exploits could have been toned done some but overall good books.
B005LAIHQS|5.0|Have all the MIB moves, Will Smith did a great job as well as Tommy Lee Jones.  This is much better than MIB2.  It really brought things in perspective and full circle from the original MIB
B00BP4Z8XY|2.0|Those that are old enough to get the video game references from the 80s are too old to appreciate this movie.  Those who aren't old enough might like it, but they'll miss out on the few humorous moments of the show.
B0000AM6IY|5.0|Five stars for the movie and for the widscreen disc editions also sold on Amazon, but a \\"Full Screen\\" pan and scan DVD editon of this timeless classic still being sold in this day and age of HDTV? You have got to be kidding me! This film was shot 2.20:1 widescreen, meaning anyone watching this movie from this cropped DVD edition will lose half the picture. Even on an older analog tube TV, this fine film should be viewed widescreen. Far too much of the action and scenery is cut off, along with actors talking off the screen is what to expect from this cropped version (I have viewed a full screen version of this film). Anyone serious about adding this fine classic to their collecton should look at the other widescreen edtions still available, be it DVD or Blu Ray. Not really sure if this DVD edition is a recent re-release or a repackaged DVD from 2001, but my recommendation is to avoid the \\"Full Screen Edtion\\"
B007GE2H3G|4.0|I wasn't familiar with Tin-Tin before the movie, but Spielberg really put together a terrific movie with humor, suspense and action.  I've seen it twice.
B0049MPHY4|5.0|A great read that builds up well and explores many interesting possibilities. I highly recommend this to anyone and everyone!
B009A87ZQU|5.0|Daniel Craig has made 007 a favorite for me-I never watched any of the James Bonds movies before this one!
B0045XKJBI|5.0|What I really like about this movie is the love between Bella and Edward. I also liked the twist of Jacob being in love with Bella.
B0061PEAUY|3.0|I have read many of the \\"Bones\\" series of books and have found many to be exciting...but not this one. And I don't know WHERE the 'crackling sexual tension' happens in this book because I never saw any of it in my copy. :( Tragic crime and a thorough investigation as usual, but lacks the excitement of many of Ms Reichs's other works.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|In my opinion this game is incredible! It keeps my 7 year old daughter occupied for long periods of time. She loves it is like owning a horse without the time and the expenses recommend this for anyone<br /><br />E
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game! It is just like Temple Run! This game is one of my favorite games on Kindle Fire! You should definitely get this app!!!
B00BVVA138|3.0|As a long-standing fan of KSE, I remember when Jesse was the vocalist the first time around. For the longest time he was my favorite when compared to Howard, but his comeback isn't as powerful as I'd hoped. It's good, just not old KSE good.
B00AW0KGYI|5.0|I bought the Twilight Saga 3 pack, and Breaking Dawn Parts 1 and 2 so I could have the whole collection,  This is a great fantasy/drama series that I would recommend for any age group.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Ive been watching season 2 on my Kindle and I am hooked! I totally recommend watching from the beginning and you will be hooked too!
B006M7JCC2|5.0|This is a good read for anyone involved with cancer, whether newly diagnosed, a survivor, a friend, family member or caretaker.  Well, that just about covers anyone I know!<br /><br />I bought it when I was newly diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer;  it has helped me to understand my feelings,<br /><br />Yes, I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone!
B006WAIV6M|5.0|I'd like to recommend this book to anyone who wishes to learn more about habits: how important they are, how they're formed and how they could be overruled. The author provides us with lots of interesting illustrative materials based on real stories of people, business companies and even human movements. When you finish this book, you'll be able to change your life in the way you want. Just prepare for a hard work.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|A friend suggested that I might like this book....I can say that I loved it!  At times I forgot that it was composed from an animals point of view! Loved Enzo.  As I finished reading this, it has started to rain...
1400069807|5.0|Admittedly, I did not purchase this book on amazon. I purchased it at my local book store. I usually purchase about 10% locally hoping to keep the local guy fed. That said, I found this book to be very informative regarding the corporate mentality regarding the three aforementioned ingredients. The author takes the reader through the three ingredients, one at a time and in somewhat of a historical chronology, recounts the development of each of these in a variety of snacks and junk foods that we are all too familiar with. I have noticed some of the reviewers make the observation that the book points the blame at corporations for America's (and eventually other countries) bad eating habits and subsequent increased levels of diabetes, heart disease etc. I don't ever recall the author coming out a blatantly saying as such. However, I think one can see the correlation between what is happening in the food industry with what happened with big tobacco. If companies are \\"trying\\" to make formulations for products so that customers will eat more, and become addicted, I would think the reach to culpability is just inches away.  Who should read this book? Anyone who does the grocery shopping for their family. Anyone who refuses to learn how to cook from scratch. Anyone who has a high risk, or family disposition to health issues such as obesity, heart disease, hypertension, or any snack aholic. One last thing. The reveiw section for this book has some pretty heated discussions especially in the \\"one star\\" arena. Even from people who never even read the book. Go figure.
B000FCKRDI|4.0|A very gentle and enjoyable read with characters that you'd want to root for through-out.  Some really funny scenes and of course, 6-months is impossible.<br /><br />I would have liked to get more background story from Sebastian though.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|difficult to get credits  free credits do not always add in  I would like to be able to change my cards
B000P2A256|5.0|love maroon 5, got my package within a couple weeks, so not super fast but that was expected. Still love the product, and for a good price.
B004GBIE3Y|4.0|I enjoyed this movie as I am a fan of this type of genre.  I recommend this feel good movie.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|This story is a bit wordy but interesting. The author could have made his point with many fewer pages. I lost interest towards the end.
B000FVE3BG|5.0|I bought it for my husband, and he loves it so much.  He is not a lefty but he likes to wear his watches on the right hand, so it is perfect for that.  Great looking watch, at little on the big side if you like chunky watches.
B004CRR9G0|5.0|A great adventure for the kids and parents. I was shocked to hear it was form 1984 because the animation was amazing, the story odd but intresting, and it sends a message to us all. Buy this one for the family.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|We need more stories with descriptions of persons with 'unhealthy' minds.  I can't think  of a better word for it, but there are so many people in this world who suffer through life being &#34;different,&#34; when more understanding of the things life can bestow upon us through no fault of our own that can limit our ability to cope with the vicissitudes that others can handle. I don't seem to be able to come up with the words I need to explain what I mean, but perhaps someone will understand what I'm trying to say.
055358894X|5.0|Ok I didn't \\"read\\" the book, but I listened to it on audible. Let me first say that I ONLY read/listen to fantasy, specifically Epic Fantasy. I generally like all the fantasy books I came across, but for me to give one 5 stars, means that it is flawless. The only reason I decided to give my opinion is because I couldn't believe the ridiculous bad reviews I read below. I am not expecting everyone to give it 5 stars like I did, but to give it a 1 or even a 2, is mind-boggling. There is so much to praise in this book even if you are not a fan of the genre.<br /><br />First of all, this is the first book I read where the \\"Hero\\" is no hero at all. There is nothing fantastical about Locke Lamora. He is not a forgotten prince, nor is a he an early/late blooming wizard. He is not boy who grows up to be an amazing warrior or a shadowy assassin. Nevertheless, the character is genius, literally. He is no ordinary thief. He is a con artist and all the bells and whistles that come with the job. How do you write an Epic fantasy where the main character's only strength is his wit? Scott Lynch does it masterfully.<br /><br />Second, the world that Lynch creates, matches perfectly the subtle yet sophisticated characters in it. It has a Venetian flavor with the dark undertone that is needed for the story. For a fantasy story, everything feels quite believable and real. People who gave it bad reviews for the few vulgar words in it are really closed minded. I am not a fan of profanity but it definitely didn't bother me. I hear the same type of language at a ball game or an elementary school. At least in the book, they fit the characters and their settings. How the hec would you expect a kingpin who is running a gang of thugs to talk like?<br /><br />Finally, the epic journey is really that. A roller coaster ride of epic failures and insane successes. Those who read the first 2 books in this series are probably loosing sleep waiting for The Republic of Thieves. I don't think you will get enough of Locke Lamora once you plunge into his world.t enough of Locke Lamora once you plunge into his world.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This story was so intriguing I didn't even mind the attempted violence.  Sparks sometimes likes to add just a touch of the paranormal in some of his novels.  It's not enough to offend the skeptical mind, but it seems to always add enough to really add something very intriguing to the novel.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I love this game and it is very addicting.. wish it had some bigger daily prizes for hitting a fifty or hundred day mark though.. been going for over one hundred days and all i got was a bird bath.. still a fun game. My son likes to collect the coins and watch my village grow.
B007PT1PEY|5.0|This has literally everything and is a great read. I'd only read one or two of the short stories before, but read through every single one in about 2 months. They are the perfect length to read before bed and I was averaging about 1 a night.
B004UNX1LS|5.0|You name the genre of music you like and make a video playlist.  The video qualty is great for most videos, and you can fine tune the videos to your taste or just start the videos playing and VEVO will keep the videos coming in the genre you adore.  Must have app if you like music videos.
B00CBRH4YU|3.0|A lesser Malick film is still a good film, but in this film, only the smallest thread of a plot is left. Little bits and trails of dialog are used or not, but are all but meaningless. There is little character development, but hints at character as our main character, a sad, bipolar(?) woman played by Olga dances and twirls through everyday life.<br />I admire what Malick is doing in this film, showing us little impressionistic bits of life and love, interspersed with narrative and peppered with beautiful scenery. It's the same style that worked, in my opinion, quite well in The New World, Thin Red Line and even Tree of Life. The problem here is this time, Malick has completely eschewed a script and the movie falls flat and although it's beautiful to listen to and look at, there is very little connection.<br />I would recommend this to fans of cinema and Malick, although be forewarned this is a very Malickian movie, very un-Hollywood.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|this is my favorite app.  I can view all my interests without search the internet for information.  If you like to read about your interests, then this is the app for you.  You name it, Fox Network, MSNBC, The Drudge Report, Sports, Celebrity, Country Music, Fitness, Photography, and this app allows you to add it to your flipboard.  I even bought a tablet to read the information avaialble.
B00B97SNJI|5.0|The first time I heard the album, I thought it seemed a bit thin compared to Dawes' two previous albums. But the more I listen to it, the more I like it. The songs have subtlety and depth, and I love a band that doesn't resort to gimmicks -- just a few instruments, great song-writing, and a great voice.
B009MF56GC|5.0|This is the second in a wildly entertaining action movie with a phenomenal cast. If you like Blu Ray you will absolutely love this all the more. Must have.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Far from being just another musical on film, this is a retelling of Hugo's tale in its own unique way. Much has been made of the &#34;live&#34; singing, which was an excellent and gutsy technique...but there are so many other cinematic elements that make this a ground-breaker that it will endure, I think, for decades. The combination of close-ups and hi-def images give the story a gritty realism that enhances the characters and brings the time and place home in a new way.
098555780X|5.0|If you are wanting to make anything with paracord, then you must have this book. I could not begin to say how great this book is at presenting a fantastic tool for the beginner, intermediate, or even pro level paracord enthusiast. Get it now, you will be glad that you did.
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|Cudos to the technical folks who had the difficult task of committing a fine performance to video. A huge venue, and only 2 performances to get it right. Makes up for the disappointing film version.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|The author's credentials are extremely impressive and relevant. The story is told in an eloquent way, and my personal analysis is that this is a book that holds some important pieces to the puzzle of what happens to us after death.
B004I2K4E8|5.0|This is a great production and companion piece to the 10th anniversary concert. I especially enjoyed the combined Valjeans at the end. Completely different experience from the excellent motion picture.
B008MZPW1C|5.0|Absolut empfehlenswerte CD! Im typischen, verbessertem Stil von Neil Halstead. Es ist mir noch immer unklar, warum diese CD mit dieser erstklassigen Musik nicht auf dem deutschen Markt erschienen ist und man nur durch Zufall und intensivem Suchen über diese CD stolpert. Selbiges gilt auch für &#34;Oh! Mighty Engine&#34;! Die Wartezeit für den Versand nach Deutschland wird mit einer der genialsten CDs belohnt.
B004GYY714|5.0|Easy to operate, takes a wee bit of exploring to see the features. I use it late at night while doing some e-reading on my tablet;
B00BCZU8WM|4.0|his performance of Suit & Tie on Saturday Night Live was phenomenal!  I wish they'd put out a Best Of Justin Timberlake on SNL.  I would definitely buy that!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This was by far the best of the three books. Absolutely loved the story. I wish th ere were three more books to read.
B007REV4YI|2.0|Sadly, the film was an unexpected disappointment.<br />Little humor, no romance (unless you consider the mother/son love relationship between Bond and M), extremely dark, gratuitous bang bang shoot 'em blow 'em up...<br />Mostly - the plot was desperately predictable.<br />Sigh.<br />High hopes, dashed.<br />Perhaps better on the big screen but I doubt it.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|I love it. It's a great way to store pictures without the worry of losing them. I recommend it to anyone who takes pictures.  Love the mobile app.
B000FA675C|5.0|Very good plot with it's twist's and turn's. Really educated me with some aspects of religion and the bible, and a lot of it made sense.<br />Mystery lover's, enjoy!
B006BDHAX0|4.0|a fun and relaxing game. I plan to play again. responsive to touch. I like the different layouts for game play
B009UZLRJE|5.0|We bought this after seeing a few reruns tv. It is a great tv show and I recommend it to everyone that asks.
B007RTAR64|5.0|I purchased two of these dolls, one for each of my daughters for Christmas.  They absolutely love the doll and are huge fans of the books and movie.  They loved the doll and have her displayed in their rooms.  Often when character replicas are made they do not look so great.  However, this doll's likeness is striking in comparison to the real Katniss/Jennifer Lawrence.  Very pleased with the purchase of both dolls.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Another fast paced, slightly sarcastic novel. Reacher in all his glory. Can't wait for the next book to come out.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I chose this rating because it does everything I hoped it would do.<br />I would recommend tthis Cable to my friends and family,...anyone who has a KIndle.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|When I'm not quite tired enough to fall asleep, I exercise my brain on Flow Free. Stress disappears and I concentrate on getting those pipes where they belong. In a little while, I am relaxed enough to turn off the light.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Fun game. I am enjoying playing with the horse. Makes me wish I had one in real life. Thank you.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|I ordered this thinking it was a different game, but was happy with it.  Very addictive.  Am Still playing it.
B00BGIC2J2|4.0|Appropriate for some in the stage of their life.  Spot on with issues that we face in our 40's.  Laughed out loud.
B0029EDMEG|5.0|Tom Selleck struck gold when he chose to do this long running movie series. Quality! Dirty Harry meets Thomas Magnum!
B0000026WD|5.0|I have to say in these times of the single instead of the album. I was surprised to actually get a Michael Jackson album for a great deal. To be honest I was expecting his albums and everything associated with him to go up in price. On to the album, it was in perfect playing condition with all the original artwork and cover book inside. Which is just the way I like it, I don't want anything extra added to the album. Finally, there was a seller that had it that way.
B0094MFITS|5.0|Tom Selleck struck gold when he chose to do this long running movie series. Quality! Dirty Harry meets Thomas Magnum
0385535139|5.0|It's not a mystery story at all but it certaintly keeps the reader in suspense. It gives an insight into the legal profession, something which Grisham has done with most of his books. It's definitely a keeper.
B005PK57IK|5.0|Has some bumps in the road,keeps on keepin on.<br />Waitin  4 season  4,,,,thanks 4 askin<br />Love the detective ever so much
B00BIPCXJM|5.0|I like the themes. I really like seeing  very smart women and men interacting. The various issues are interesting and spot on to today's problems. I've watched 3 seasons now and really like seeing Michael Fox performing .The woman investigator is so intriguing and so different from the other characters. She adds a fabulous air of mystery. I love the interaction of the children, parents and work. I like the ethical questions and how they are very &#34;adult&#34; in the approach. I avoided this series because of the name then decided to watch one show and was hooked. It is truly excellent!
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Good movie with tense moments.  Even better that it's based on a true story. Filmed to look like video - unique format.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Holmes reborn as the rich son of a wealthy Briton with a drug problem and a  broken heart. Clever! And, a new approach to Watson. Not just the old faithful, yet unimaginative, sidekick but an insightful woman in Lucy Lui. A budding detective in her own right. Very new age!<br /><br />Good supporting cast as well.<br /><br />My wife and I have enjoyed the entire season and look forward to season 2.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|I have bought several games for my Kindle and I must admit this is at the top of my list for now.  So happy for this App.
B004132HZS|5.0|In the past five years, we have seen three different adaptations of Sherlock Holmes, this version, the Robert Downey, Jr. films, and CBS's Elementary.  Of those three, Sherlock is definitely the best because there are no unnecessary scenes, like the Robert Downey, Jr. films, and no major departures from the original stories, like Elementary.  Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman are brilliant as Sherlock and Watson, and the supporting cast member are excellent as well.  The writing is wonderful with episodes directly based off of the original stories, along with winks and nods towards some of Doyle's shorter Holmes stories as well.  It is almost impossible to pick a favorite episode, although I am partial towards The Hounds of Baskerville since I am from Indiana.  Not to be missed.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is sci fi for all ages (though I am not typically a sci fi fan!)  Could not put this down.  Bought a copy for my teen daughter as well.  Howey has a fantastic futuristic yarn here.  His writing is clean but vivid; the main character fully empathetic.  Howey's imagination is at full throttle -- he has clearly thought through all the details to make it real.  I am hooked and now fully engrossed in Silo, the prequel series.  Read Wool first.

B00BEEC6L2|5.0|This collection is a great introduction to Judge Dredd. I was surprised about how large it was and enjoyed every minute of it.
B00B8WXFWE|4.0|This album wasn't what I was expecting, but that's not a bad thing. Considering how long NKOTB has been around, it's great that they're still stretching and doing different music. They still sound like the band we love, but this is a somewhat different style of music than, say, The Block.<br /><br />It seemed to me to be a more mid-tempo album. There are a few ballads. Actually, a couple of the songs have very similar beats and aside from the lyrics being different, I don't know if could have figured out how the songs were actually different.<br /><br />One of the really great things about this album is that Donnie does A LOT of singing...not just rapping, but out and out singing, and he sounds great. I've always loved his voice and it's nice to hear it highlighted again. Also, it's great to have solos from Danny and Jon. AND I was happy to hear Jordan's falsetto making a real mark on this album. It seemed like it wasn't much in use on The Block, and it, too, sounds great on 10.<br /><br />The only real complaint that I had was that it seemed like a little of their edge was missing...a little bit of grit...a little bit of sexy. I missed Donnie's raps, I missed the somewhat 'hip hop' feel of The Block. But I still really enjoyed this album.<br /><br />Highlight songs, for me, Remix (I like the), Miss you More, Jealous (blue), and Survive You (and the hidden track that plays after about 40 seconds of silence at the end of Survive You). In fact, Miss you More might be the most beautiful song I've heard in a long time (and Jordan kills it on this song). If you loved \\"I'll be loving you forever\\" you'll probably REALLY like this song.<br /><br />If you're a fan, you'll probably really enjoy this. And I'm hoping we don't have to wait 5 more years for another NKOTB album :)
B00ABO609A|2.0|Story seems muddled. The one main character is unsympathetic and not fully explained. The camera work is choppy and inconsistent. This film would not appeal to everyone.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Hugh's novel is a great read with strong characters, a real page turner and a triumph of the human spirit.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|A long read that I wish were longer because the adventure is so great, I don't want it to end!
B008PE9GSA|5.0|The album arrived in the mail quick like always. This is one of ZZ Top's best albums in a while.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Read this quickly--it was definitely captivating, but also a little too predictable in certain parts. Maybe a good beach read?
B004G7UTXG|5.0|This is an Inspiring story!  Good story for historians.  It really grabbed me right away. I recommend it for the family
B008DM4OTA|5.0|my daughter loves all the dr. panda games. they are all fun and so cute. i even enjoy playing them. my daughter thought the shot in the bum was funny
B0083GQ2A0|1.0|I had high hopes for this movie, but it failed gloriously at fulfilling those hopes. The movie tried too hard to straddle the boundary between a horror film and drama. Bad special effects and the ridiculous behavior of the wolves make this unwatchable.
B00BP29SAA|5.0|all the dr panda games are excellent for my 4 year old. as soon as a new one comes out we get it.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|this one kept my grandchildren ages 4, 2 and 1 entertained for about an hour and us all laughing when he talked back at us.
B0091QSNEE|5.0|my daughter loves all the dr. panda games. they are all fun and so cute. i even enjoy playing them
B00BGIC2J2|4.0|I liked the humor in the movie, thought there were some great comical situations. I can see that the movie might cut to close to the bone if you are having relationship problems.<br /><br />This is definitely not a guy movie but there was very little humor that my wife appreciated.
B0091QS88K|5.0|it hooked my 3 year old. she loves it. you will want to but the full version after playing this
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|It's simple, you get coins fast, and its cute! Worth the download. No fighting dragons or anything. You grow food fairly quickly (depending on what you buy) it's just a fun game all around.
B00AMSLRAC|5.0|my daughter loves all the dr. panda games. they are all fun and so cute. i even enjoy playing them
B007PTJOV0|4.0|This game is so much fun but a little frustrating if you stink at it. If you lose all of your lives and you aren't at a save point in the level, you go back to the previous level. But it's all fair. They give you enough coins to gain lives. If you like Mario, you'll like this.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|\\"As a detective, I'm not allowed to believe in coincidences\\"<br />--John Blake<br /><br />\\"You fight like a younger man, nothing held back.  Admirable, but mistaken.\\"<br />--Bane<br /><br />The Dark Knight Rises is a fantastic movie in all respects.  The two fight scenes between Batman and Bane are the obvious highlights.<br /><br />More importantly, Christopher Nolan has revealed important clues for anyone willing to remove their head from the sand and WAKE UP!!
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I am addicted to this game. I love it. You can play with friends or random people. If the people annoy you, you can easily take them off. It can be silly and fun, especially if you live drawing. I'm thinking about buying it.
1932907009|5.0|I've been making a living at writing and producing for TV and film for more than 20 years.  A friend recommended Blake Snyder's book and I was captivated by his approach to screenwriting and learned techniques that just made sense.  You can tell when someone is writing from the heart and &#34;Save The Cat&#34; was from the heart.  What Blake offers in this book is so simple and intuitive that you just have to smack yourself in the head and ask, &#34;why didn't I think of that?&#34;  After reading this book, I was able to go back and tweek a current feature script and I can honestly say the script is better for the tweeking.  Thank you Blake... God Rest Your Soul.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|You have to get my horse.  It is really fun.  You earn coins and gems along the way passing thru the levels.
B0033AX20E|5.0|There were no flaws in the disk and the music is awesome.  I've heard all of Dragonforce's music so I decided to buy this and was not let down.  It also came secure in the packaging.  If you haven't heard any of these songs I suggest you do so, that way you'll know what you're buying.  I love it so much &#60;3.
0684857219|5.0|This book more or less has it all. For beginner-intermediate or the very advanced, there's lots of good stuff in here for you.
B00BI745AA|3.0|The much hyped live singing ended up abetting mostly strained and garbled performances. As well lots of tight close ups, preventing the sweep of the music to pull in an audience in. And the CGI effects were jarring. Some standout acting and singing but, overall, this production drew more attention to the musical's flaws (that plot for one) while  muffling its virtues (a fine score, here only for fleeting moments).
B00BI73CVI|4.0|Les Mis (2012) was OK but not as good as the British version celebrating the 25th Anniversary. I prefer this one to the latest. The music was far more powerful and well done.
0670451495|1.0|The story is a classic that I love, however the cover to this book was upside down. It now doesn't make an acceptable gift.
B00BWJARHO|3.0|I was somewhat disappointed with the film as I truly enjoyed reading the book. I can, however, see why others would like it after seeing the Lord of the Rings trilogy.
B006Y5H74W|4.0|I love music of all types and was drawn to the show for its music.  The only thing that I don't like is the back and forth of the show and what they're going to decide to do from one week to another....it's rather frustrating.  By now, it seems like it's on track and I hope it stays there.  I loved it when Jennifer Hudson stayed for a few weeks; great singing by all!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Whew!! Great series of books!  Can't wait to see how E.L. James will top this!!! Would definitely recommend this series for couples, these books will surely set your love life on FIRE!!!!
B009AMANH4|4.0|Lincoln (Two Disc Blu-ray Combo Pack) it was a masterpice of Cinama Movie. The Acting was superb for both  Danaeil Day & Sally Field .  You could  beleive that you were watching the Real  Abraham Lincoln and his real Abraham Lincoin Family during the  13 Amendment Controversy times. It was not Boring but a very intence Repulican & Democratic Polical Battle in Washington DC During his  last Lincoln Administation times. The Candlelilte interiors illuminatiion  very intersting.  The Building were Genuine and Cloths Costums were Genuine looking.
B00B2YH7BS|5.0|First, I thought of Abby Studios, an unassuming set of rooms were great music is made. Sound City has a magic sound board but, mostly it seemed to have engineers and producers that could capture &#34;live&#34; music. The musician interviews all were insiteful. Hope the new studio carries on that tradition.
B005LAIGPU|4.0|Chronicle (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo +Digital Copy) A Kids Superman Story for just Plain Kids. They find a Magical Rock in a Cave that makes them into Supermen in Kids Sized Body & they try to handle all of those Superman Powers that comes with their owen Desasteris Problems !!
B009IH0ICG|5.0|The handle is very well attached to the 'can'.  The heat shield is of a heavy metal opposed to the metal the 'can' is made of is very thin and flexible but should hold up well to years of use if taken care of.  The grate in the bottom in which the coals rest on is very heavy wire(maybe 8gauge??) and is shaped into a cone instead of just being a flat grate like a lot of other char coal lighters out there.<br /><br />For the price you can't do much better, even though it is it made in China I feel it still deserves the Weber name.
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|It was a lot of fun and special effects too. The Story was good. I really liked it a lot
B009K0OL06|4.0|Like all the actors,well suited to thier charaters.<br />Fine it fast moving.,good for TV.<br />It's do easy to play when it suits you on Amazon Fire.
B005S9EKCW|4.0|Les Misérables (Two-Disc Combo Pack: Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy +...Has a good story .Very good music. Nice Cinama Design. It was a very Emotonal Story set in a time after the French Revolution. There were very Big Differances Between the Rich and Poor Peasant Classes.
B001DEXDNI|3.0|I like some of her music but this did not live up to my expectations.  Would have liked a little more info about this particular CD before ordering.
B000FA675C|3.0|While Dan Brown builds a nifty little mystery (sort of) and throws around a lot of interesting trivia, the characters fall flat. No real concern for their well-being at the end of the day. It hasn't been that long since I read it or watched the adaptation, but I can't recall the character's names or many of the details. Not too memorable, really, which is sort of sad considering how big this made it for a little while.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game. any time I get bored with one I just move on to another. just wish that the price for new ones didn't get higher the further you go through.
B000V6MQV4|5.0|Not a song on this album that's bad , got all their albums great!  Easy listening this album I don't have to worry about all the bad words and stuff
B004M9ZI0M|5.0|This is one one great movie.It is a must to see.<br />Helen Mirren fans will be delighted.  A real treat for<br />movie fans.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|Very interesting movie.  I always wonder how precise they got the facts down when they make movies like this. Great acting!
B007EECSFA|3.0|I gave it 3 stars in fairness, because I believe I might have been distracted.  If it had been a better read, I would not have been able to put it down.  In my opinion, it rambled and was going no where for a long, long time.  Unfortunate, because I have enjoyed all of Kate Morton's books.
B006PTZNSY|5.0|I Love This CD. Listen To It All The Time. I Would Recommend It To Anyone Who Likes Rap. It Is Pretty Explicit Though.
052118939X|5.0|No more words:  BUY it if you are learning English.  This version comes with the CD and it is good stuff.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Great story telling, and also inspiring to read other classic books that are forgotten, and to listen to music that is not played on the radio any more. I would recommend this book to all high schoolers getting ready for the next step, and to all of us who were twenty some in the 90s.
B000NMW6M0|5.0|Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett were amazing actors in this powerful and deep movie. I was not expecting such a powerful message here. It reminded me of the movie Crash and was a great experience.
B0088W7VNG|5.0|I liked it it was asome it had a lot of action and a good story behind it. With the amazon prime account I didn't have to pay so that's why it made it asome to watch
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|What history in this book, I truly had a hard time putting it down. This will be a read again book.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|Very visual writer - you do not have to buy in to the premise to love this book.  Reading this, you have to read the rest of the Outlander series.
1452110581|4.0|This was hysterical and so true!  Little did I know when I ordered it, it arrived the day after our cat peed on my husbands computer totally wiping it out!
B005LAIII0|5.0|Had it not been for comments made about this movie at the Academy Awards, I would not have considered watching this movie, let alone buyimg it.  A wonderful story told in an amazing way.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|I still wanted to read to the end but grew impatient with the repetition.  It was different.<br />I'm still glad I read it because of it's popularity.
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|Bem Affleck should have won best director for this flick.  An edge of your seat thriller based on a true event.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|It was soooo good. A WONDERful book. I recommend it.When I finished I said wow just wow.It was Amazing.<br />absolutely 5 stars! I cryed and laugh.That is how good it was.If you are looking for a good book to get your nose into this is this is the book you want to get.
B009EE0DO6|1.0|Really garbage. DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE!!<br />Boring, plotless, stupid!<br />WASTE OF TIME!<br />unless you want to pay for some R rated action that is!
B000J103PC|5.0|I LOVE Meryl Street, and Anne Hathaway isn't too bad either. I love this movie because of the awesome acting and the themes of being in the high life of fashion.
B00BMNM4H6|4.0|hey! I love this game and just and fyi; they also have it on engineer.com with a bunch of other games. this game really is fun and creative and I would totally recomend it to anyone who likes challenging themselves.
B008220B0C|5.0|I always enjoyed her music, but after I saw this movie I couldn't stop listening to her music.  It is an excellent glimpse of what her California Dreams Tour was like. I would recommend you see it before deciding whether you want to own it or not.
B0001I561E|4.0|it was for my wife but she like it and she got it pretty fast and had no problems with it
B007TNS6JI|5.0|This is the best game you could play but it takes some of your mb but it's worth it :)
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|I really like this game, but it is FULL of glitches. Play one game &amp; it takes all my hearts. I gain levels, &amp; don't earn my bars or bonuses. Good game, but needs some work. Glad I didn't pay anything for it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is FANTASTIC. First of all, it's a great time waster and good for killing time or waiting at the doctor's office, etc. I love the graphics and controls and I think that the game is well designed and easy to play. The BEST part of Subway Surfers is the controls, though. With most running style games (Temple Run, and so on) you must tilt the device from side to side in order to move your character. With this game, however, you just swipe from one side to another to avoid twisting around to find the right place for your arm to go in order to tilt the device. You can also just put the device down on a table or bed and play one-handed. The cherry on top is that it's free!
B000FA675C|5.0|Dan Brown's eyes see through the mist and deception to reveal little-known insights into the Jesus story.  Some is based on fact and some is fiction, but all together it's a great story.  It caused a sensation when first published and continues being a marker for change.  This was my second reading, and I enjoyed it as much as the first time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it is absolutely cool everyone plays it I recommend you buy this game you'll be a loser and regret what you did
B004ZQRFGM|5.0|I first heard of Ana Popovic as an Amazon recommendation. I had recently discovered Joe Bonnamassa and ordered some of his cds from Amazon. Ana does some amazing guiter work on this cd. She puts a lot of feeling into her writing, playing and singing.<br />I got the chance to see her live at a local blues fest and her extended jams (and hot looks) are even better up close! I'd say her music is definitely right up there with Stevie Ray  and Joe Bonnamassa. Keeping the blues/rock genre burning hot!
B000UZNRS2|5.0|Very entertaining and kept my interest throughout the entire book. I enjoyed the entire Camel club series. recommend to all
B007SGM084|5.0|AMAZING a must read for anyone!! I love the characters in the book! Christian and Anastasia should be the most loved couple in the universe all the drama and steamy sex;) the fifty shades trilogy will always be at the top!!!
B000FCKIFU|5.0|Very good and thoroughly worth reading. I reccomend this series to everyone who likes suspense thrillers. Good reading for all.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Downton Abbey has been around for a while now but I hadn't watched. I wanted to but didn't get around to it. A friend on Twitter said it was so worth watching so I finally did. Amazon Prime had streaming available for seasons 1 & 2 and they were amazing. So amazing in fact that I purchased season 3. I recommend it.
0345444051|5.0|[A word of warning: This review contains all manner of spoilers.]<br /><br />I read Arthur C. Clarke's Childhood's End many years ago. I also read it to my son when he was eight. So why did I come back to a book that was originally published in 1953, read it yet again, and feel it necessary to write a review?<br /><br />What got me thinking about Childhood's End again is the emergence of the Internet as force for change within the Global Community. Also, my limited experience teaching university students impressed upon me the impact that the Internet is having on the minds of our young people.<br /><br />As a novelist myself and an author of a book on how to write a novel, I first must say that Childhood's End is marvelously plotted. It starts off with a startling revelation: Earth is not only being visited by extraterrestrials, called Overlords, but they have come to take over the world, prevent our annihilation, and impose restrictions on human activities that will insure not only our survival but also that we prosper. This then locks the conflict (first plot point) between humans and ET, and as with so much of Clarke's fiction, the conflict is at a relatively low level. ET, or the Overlords in this case, is here to help.<br /><br />When one group, the Freedom League, wishes to oppose the Overlords more forcefully, they are soon subdued, non-violently. The one thing the Overlords will not do is show themselves. Humans make an attempt at seeing one of them, but don't get away with it. As a result, the Overlords agree to let them see them, but not for another fifty years, two generations. This then is the second plot point, which occurs 20% of the way through the story, a little short of where you'd expect it.<br /><br />As time drags on, humanity loses its edge. We are no longer as creative as we once were, and culturally we have stagnated. Utopia is never all it's cracked up to be. And the time finally comes when the Overlords reveal their physical selves, and a strange sight they are, and yet immediately recognizable. They are the very image of Satan, red skin, horns, and pointed tail, leathery wings. No wonder they'd been so secretive. However, since they had shown their goodwill through the years, little was made of their \\"coincidental\\" resemblance to an ancient symbol of evil. This revelation comes at the 1/3 point and a little beyond what we'd think of as the second plot point and well short of 1/2 point that we'd think of as the third plot point.<br /><br />At the mid-point of the novel, we get a true reversal. At a party, guests play a game similar to a Ouija Board. One of the participants asks, \\"Which star is the Overlords' home?\\" And the answer they get back is \\"NGS 549672.\\" Only one of the guests realizes that this is a database entry for a star forty lightyears away in the constellation Carina. This person then starts making plans to stowaway on the next Overlord spaceship to their home. The Overlords have subdued the humans up until this point, but now one of them is on the hunt to find out more than the Overlords wish them to know. This is plot point three.<br /><br />Just before the three-quarters point, one of the earthlings stows away on the Overlords' spaceship and leaves earth with them. His journey there and back will take eighty years, Earth time, but just a few months in relativistic time above the rocket traveling at close to the speed of light. Just a little later, at the three-quarters point in the novel, a strange event occurs. An Overlord saves one of the human children. For some reason the Overlords believe he is special. And then children all over the world start having strange dreams and developing telekinetic powers. This is what the Overlords have waited for all this time.<br /><br />At the end of the novel, we learn that what the story has been about all along is the children. The human race is entering a new phase, one that will only manifest in our children. They are becoming something otherthan human beings and metamorphosing into something that transcends human existence. It's as if the worm finally becames a butterfly. And we learn that those who have been known as the Overlords are actually only caretakers of the human race while it undergoes the transformation into something spiritually superior to human beings. The children no longer relate to their parents, and the parents have no knowledge of their children. It's a clean break.<br /><br />As it turns out, the Overlords are a tragic species. They cannot and never will make the transformation to this higher plane. And they take their orders from yet a higher power, the power that then comes for the children of mankind. The Overlords are a dead-end species from another world and can only witness the process, foster it, but never undergo it themselves.<br /><br />The denouement comes with the man who had hitched a ride on the Overlords spaceship and gone to their home planet. He returns after eighty years, having seen the home of the Overloads and what a magnificent species they are. But he is the only human being left on earth, and he witnesses the end of the human race.<br /><br />One other interesting facet of Clarke's novel is that, since the story is spread over 150 years or so, he uses a series of third-person limited narrations.

It's as if the worm finally becames a butterfly. And we learn that those who have been known as the Overlords are actually only caretakers of the human race while it undergoes the transformation into something spiritually superior to human beings. The children no longer relate to their parents, and the parents have no knowledge of their children. It's a clean break.<br /><br />As it turns out, the Overlords are a tragic species. They cannot and never will make the transformation to this higher plane. And they take their orders from yet a higher power, the power that then comes for the children of mankind.

B0050KTR36|5.0|This approach has been integral in learning muscles for my anatomy and physiology class. It doesn't really help you spell them but boy, does it help you learn placement. Buy this app!!!
0151003084|5.0|This is classic Gorey!  Dark humor at it's best - one of my favorites!  (Not recommended for small children.)  ;)
B0087JTAKW|5.0|This is a really great parable. It made me think and best of all it soothed me. I recently lost my father in law to cancer, and my husband is so sad. I think I will read this book to him.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Great Game.  Needed hints to figure out some parts. Keep my interest. Will have to get the sequel.  Hope it comes out soon.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|This game is a lot of fun. I have all of the temple run's and I must say that I like this one better than all of the rest of them. But all of the Temple Run's are cool. So which ever one you choose, you won't be disappointed in any of them.
0811879542|4.0|This is a simple enjoyable book that I bought for my two grandchildren (18 & 19 mos/ girl & boy). They enjoyed the interactive parts and they caught on quickly what they had to do. Think it will work even better with older children. Plan to give this book as gifts in the future
B00B0U2SEA|5.0|There are no words that could possible describe the impact of this movie. The acting was spot on. The Amon character was chilling.
B000000XB9|5.0|Love that we can still purchase older music and it sounds great. This was an awesome CD that brought back alot of memories
B00AATFJK2|5.0|This is a classic movie. I remember it as a young person and wanted to see if it could withstand the test of time. It certainly did that.
B008MEM24S|1.0|I don't like this app because of its use of idiotic puzzles and how it is &#34;lagged&#34; . But if your looking for a app to make little kids less winey this is a good app.
B00ARA4SLU|5.0|I found this Blu-ray to be a wonderful insight to one of the greatest directors ever and the love story with his wife.  The acting was superb.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I like this game for its design in use of constructing and venturing with the beloved angry birds pig that we all so loved to pulverize.
B005K17RU0|1.0|I added my zip , entered, nothing ever showed. What a waste of time. I'll just stick my head out the door for more accurate info.
B002TO1Z8Q|5.0|Loved the concert footage - I felt as if I was right there. Excellent quality and sound. George Michael is the truth !!
B005COO1X6|3.0|This one won't be a movie anytime soon, but it definitely is a great little story for your enjoyment.  Clever, haunting, and unique.  Will make for a quick read when you are looking for a story to pass the time.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game so much I don't want to stop playing it.I love this game because. it actualy tought me how to take care of horse's
B00BGDF1FO|5.0|Like the game, this OST is a complete package. All the in game tracks seem to have been placed within this album. The actual album is about 14 tracks but repeated:the 1st set of 14 are the full tracks with vocal lyrics while the next set is the same but instrumental.<br /><br />Recommended tracks are Rules of Nature, I'm My Own Master Now, A Stranger I Remain, Red Sun, Hot Wind Blowing.<br /><br />MUST HEAR: It Has To Be This Way (Platinum Mix)
B009AMAGQM|2.0|Just reading all this is a disappointment.<br />I read all three books, not just the first and it was just phenomenal. Macon returns, there is , Ethan s mother appears when need and is part of this, and yes all the characters in the book play such an important role. There is a seventeenth moon and the eighteenth is the last whether the world is around our not, can't tell u the ending, but this whole story was so intense, they could of continued with part 2&3<br />There is so much if you like this you have to read the books, book 2 is Beautiful darkness, and 3 is Beautiful Chaos, enjoy, there is also beautiful redemption, but that tells more about the characters
B000XKZQ74|5.0|Fascism is not a pleasure to see. The agent, though, was humane and sensitive. Unfurtunately, I do not have to go to<br />East Germany, to experience this type of activity. Stasis abound.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|It is an exciting story, but it seems to start and pause.  It lacked the clear narrative of the Hunger Games. But if you read the first two, you have to read it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Book is way better than the movie. They gave so much emotion in the book and I fell asleep watching the movie because it was so boring.
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|The movie does a good job of keeping you uncomfortable and  unsettled with enough scares to make if a worth while watch. The ending really lives up to its title.
B004U8VWLE|5.0|The product came faster than I though it would and met my expectations, was excellent quality, nothing wrong with it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|10/10 would bang. This show is great. Season 3 finale was weak and rushed but overall a great season of a great show.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I liked it because it was a good clean movie with lots of story.I was sad to see it end.  I recommend it to anyone
B008J2GAKU|5.0|Great story, great writing, great art...a plot that brings out Batman as a detective with elements of Horror and even a Sherlock Holmsian feel to it...cant wait to grab the next volume.
B00AW0KGYI|5.0|I have followed Twilight series from the beginning, however; extended edition- part 1 should have been the theather release first.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|I'm a suspicious reader when I read a book like this.  One knows there has to be a twist at the end.  However, I never figured it out until the main character did!  Very well articulated plot.  It isn't a difficult read and has some information about traumatic brain injuries as well, so it is enlightening.  Very difficult to put down once you get into it!
1476734941|4.0|Still reading this diet plan, so far I find it should be easy to adapt to and receipies are easy to follow.
B000FA675C|5.0|Fast paced, intriguing story line. Excellent way to spend an evening, weekend or sneak away during the day. You won't be able to put it down!
B0090X4GJE|5.0|Simply put this is a CD so necessary to everyone's audio CD. This is by far one of the best albums I have ever heard.<br />So much creativity, energy, and ove for music has gone in the production of this album, and yes she is a Halcyon.<br />Every song is amazing, and is a music explosion of the most epic proportions. Get it, if for nothing else then to help<br />us get another one out of Ms. Ellie Goulding!
B00AIUUXHC|2.0|this app should get 5stars but it always resets my progress. don't buy it, not worth the time! the app has great graphics but resetting my work is tooooo much
B0010V4TZU|5.0|I love this band, amazing, awesome. Great album! Incredible. They captured the college experience so well.<br />This is one of my fave CD's in my collection, next only to the second album which is incredible! Incredible!
B0098460O4|5.0|If you have not heard this story, go to YouTube and learn about them.  Then listen to their music.  Excellent voices and music.
B004KD5TQI|5.0|This is an easy review. This is the best Album in my collection. The movie sucked but I love the soundtrack. Every song is great<br />and amazingly done. Wrote my book to this album!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|A fun game that makes you think fast.  The faster you do it the better.  Fun and relaxing. Keeps you on your toes as you play
B00AYB1RGG|3.0|Good mindless entertainment but nothing special. Very violent and scenes are graphic and disturbing...lifelike.<br />Beware if you have young children who may be watching.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Makes you work your eyes and brain power in ways that are great.  A good game to help with concentration on things
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Great movie! Wonderful examples of \\"mash up\\" music! Anna Kendrick becomes a star. So fun to see the scenes of Tulane campus---
B0064T6LV8|5.0|I love to play pinball.  To find one that is great and fun was nice.  Challenging and fast paced thrill.
B00992CF6W|5.0|you should get this game! NOT A RIPOFF! I think it should have more creepers though. I wish there was mods!
B002SRQ214|3.0|I play online games (MMOs) and have a decent mid-range setup and once my game gets going the fan kicks up to super noisy speed. It whines more than a 2 year old. Buy a good cooler and ditch the stock that comes with.
145162445X|4.0|A Universe From Nothing: Why There Is Something Rather Than Nothing Is a good book.  However, It's an overview of current cosmology and I expected a more specific book, with some of the math that shows his reasoning.  It consists of general information rather than specific cases.  It's a book I would expect from Isaac Asimov and not a cosmologist.  I'm not saying it isn't a good read.  It's well written and easy to read.  It did contain a few things I didn't already know, so I'm satisfied in the learning department.  Overall, I would recommend this book to anyone who would like to know what's going on it the Astronomy world.  However, if you want to know what's happening in the forefront of cosmology, this book isn't it.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this is a great game for horse lovers! its entertaining and fun. Only way it could be better is if thry got rid of the ads!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love the new cities and new things that come with them. Have subway suffers on my phone and tablet..intertaining and fun to compete with friends.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|This is a fun game but it is hard to earn extra lives. I wish you could earn them a little faster but I still like it.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Wonderful story, very very well done. The casting was superb, the costumes, makeup, or lack of makeup was perfect. The cars are amazing, finding those old Rolls Royces must have been difficult.
B009K0OL06|5.0|One of the Best!!!  A must watch in my book.  Watch and enjoy.  Pretty much a women's show for sure.
B000FA675C|5.0|Epic book that takes real places, real things, and facts and weaves a tale unlike anything I have ever read before.
B000002GB9|5.0|Highly recomended as styx should be. New condition fast delivery<br />resonably priced. nothing else to say buy it now you will not be sorry.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Still enjoying it, but it has lost some of its cleverness and edge. The writing seems a little off this season. Ironinic
B009IF8CH6|4.0|I think the show is very funny intellectually stimulating fast paced and surprisingly witty very informative a little weird but entertaining can't wait to watch the next show.<br />Demetre Dimopoulos
B000FA675C|5.0|I always enjoy rereading a favorite book.  The Da Vinci Code did no disappoint.  I also own the movie version and rewatched it after reading the book.<br />As a member of Freemasons, I always enjoy reading how fiction authors treat our fraternity.
B00BYH6OJO|1.0|Russel Crowe...Marky Mark...thought it would HAVE to be great. Did NOT expect such a terrible movie. Lame. Many holes and extremely predictable. Aaaargh.
0385349947|5.0|Only half way through the book and I'm enjoying it. Very easy read, since Sheryl writes the book as though she is speaking. Received the book quickly.
0345803485|5.0|I read all three books in a week.  This story was completely awesome, I did not want to put the book down. I love the characters and cannot wait for E.L James' new book.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I am so glad I discovered this series. Outstanding story and certainly primed for many more to come. Please do Hugh! Keep them coming! On to the next book now....
0345803493|5.0|This story was completely awesome, I did not want to put the book down. I love the characters and cannot wait for E.L James' new book.
0385394233|4.0|I purchased this audio for my wife (currently has an M.B.A.), she commented as follows: This is a very interesting read - will it truly have any long term effects? The author covers many interesting points and issues, I'm not sure it's going to result in to some kind of a new movement but time will tell.
0345803507|5.0|This story was completely awesome, I did not want to put the but down. I love the characters and cannot wait for E.L James' new book.
B0094K1WZE|3.0|Was OK for a newer film in the Amazon library but wouldn't want to watch it again as is the criteria for rating a movie 4 or 5 stars.
B00B8WXG9G|5.0|There is something really special with this record, you can hear it with the first listening. I have not purchased any of Anka's  in the past 10 years, I may have to re-think that one. Duets albums generally are not my favorite releases- to commercial. But I do not hear that here,just wonderful talent at their very peak. How often can you write that in a review, but here I certainly can.<br />\\"I Really Miss You\\" what a great pairing, the great Leon Russell and the song is very interesting and so well done.<br />\\"Think Im In Love Again\\" here there is a intimate song, and yet both artist give each enough space to make the song work.<br />\\"Crazy\\" I have listened to this song so many times by a number of artist, and yet I hear something in this recording I have missed before. I really like finding something new.<br />Chris Botti adds that special talent only he can- he just cooks on everything.<br />I hope all listeners will feel the same as I, you can not go wrong with this exceptional recording. I know I will be listening for many more years to come.
B007QDNKQA|4.0|The timeliness of this movie when we hear about Seal Team Six and the special forces book about the shooter in Afganistan this is a thriller.  Does not put government cronyizm in a positive light but that is the case in other things as well
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Being an older female was not at all sure about this movie but it was very good, acting was excellent. enjoyed very much
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|One of the best films i have seen.Should be required viewing in schools across the country and should be viewed by anyone interested in American politics.
B002U3CCF6|3.0|Not a bad whodunnit, although I picked the perp very early on. Flynn does a good job of encouraging us to like a &#34;cutter&#34; and it is chock-a-block with characters easy to dislike. All in all a decent read.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|I read this book because of the huge popularity of the movie.  I wanted to read the book first because as everybody knows books are ALWAYS better than the movies ... except this time the movie is sooo much better than the book!<br />This book is fun but repetitive
B00C32R64G|5.0|I love this album, and all their others. This band could be the next Metallica if they did more touring in the US.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I have to say I enjoyed every single word of this book. Besides being beautifully written the story line is great!
B003M6EAXM|5.0|Well yet another heart thumping, high octane, life and death moment - by - moment roller coaster ride of breaking protocols, unexpected treachery and incompetent politicians that don't listen to Jack Bauer and his pragmatic clarity and his willingness to do what needs to be done in bring us a satisfying 24 hours excitement.<br /><br />I think it is so cathartic to have Jack out there getting all the bad guys, and hey maybe he should become president!
B00C32R64G|5.0|I had liked Volbeat's previous releases, but 'Outlaw Gentlemen & Shady Ladies' is freaking awesome! It's much heavier then any previous releases and the western theme is a nice touch. It's like if Metallica's James Hetfield could REALLY sing, mixed with a touch of Elvis and Stray Cats mixed in. Love it! Keep it coming like this Volbeat and I will be a fan for life!!
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Another masterpiece from Wes Anderson. A wild and quirky love story that will leave you with a hankering for the lost world of yesterday
0345803493|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book and am very intested in reading the last book of the trilogy.  It was great and I recommend these books to anyone.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Such a great story.  It was so easy to get wrapped up in the lives of those who live at Downton!
B0064W65UM|5.0|We had to read it for my English class and it was amazing. I had seen the movie but I would definitely recommend the book.
B000KUD2G4|4.0|I would have a noticeably loud buzz kinda sound coming from my bass when i was recording , I bought this and hooked it up and the buzz and noise diminished by %90-%95. Its a good product i like it. would recommend!
B006LSZECO|5.0|loved this book!!!  the story grabs you and there are so many twists and turns.  fun to read and share with a friend!
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Fantastic, fantastic!!! World ar Arms is a remarkable real time war game. Great graphics... endless fun!!!<br />Highly recommended download. Only criticism would be the lack of ease / expense in getting gold medal.
B000FA675C|5.0|This is a must read for mystery lovers. It is one of those you just can't put down. Looking forward to this authors next book.
B009RI4FRU|3.0|As an adult, I don't enjoy watching children exploring their sexuality. The only reason I gave it an 'okay' is there was some humor in it although the delivery was very dry. The whole movie was monotone which I suppose was the point, although the scout troop was enjoyable.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Works like a dream. Definitely worth the price for the pro version. Shows all for video, online and reading apps.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Very fun and a good time waster. Very addictive as well. Got out because a friend wanted me to and got instantly hooked
B001UGB1X8|3.0|It's a good plot and overall good movie (TLJ was good) but the old &#34;civil war&#34; actors aren't very good and it kind of put a damper on the movie for me.
B00ANW33CM|5.0|I don,t Think People who Are Prone To Vertigo will Like It.  But It's A Blast To Play If You Are Looking for A New Mahjong Challenge.
B008J2GAKU|5.0|From start to finish I was on the edge of my seat. With an intriguing story, great dialogue, surprising twists, and a new villain that seems to truly match other villains in their threat and mental/physical pain that they deal to Batman. This is one of my favorite storylines that I have read to date. I highly recommend this buy and can't wait to read the next volume.
B009E3EYMY|5.0|What a compilation of there music glad i purchased this cd buy it listen to it if you love led zeppelin and classic rock
B002BY77CW|5.0|I loved this book! It was creative and always kept you guessing. I can't wait to read the other books in this series.
B00BQPEIT2|1.0|I tried to download this game to my kindle from amazon and it won't work when I purchase it. Please fix it.
B00BOLFRKW|5.0|This dramatic protrayal of the last 4 months of the Civil War and the political manuvering that took place to get the passing of the 13th amendment to the constitution should be shown to all American History Scholars as a lesson in what it took to endure the political struggles that took place.
B004UJTG6Q|3.0|For its time, a fun book to read and probably accurate in description of people and living conditions.  The adventures range from intriguing to simplistic.
B005I6EU48|5.0|Looks great, not too bulky and protects the product - it is very much admired by my family and friends.
B0091REZMW|3.0|You need to be careful about the game, money does not come easy,and you will be,spending a lot try to earn a lot in the game that is my advice.
B00B19DMUE|5.0|This is a great movie.  I don't ever, ever, ever want any kinda box from ANYONE!  Talk about having bad juju.  This will make you peek thru your fingers for just a moment.  NO BOXES EVER!!!!!! haahahah<br /><br />enjoy
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I truly like. This game , It does have a few problems ,of losing your coins gems and levels,but they are trying to fix it, you can go to support as tell them, and suggest things. As be careful on gems to buy things gems is harder to earn,buying gems as coins does require real money but enjoy the game and befriend lots of people,they help you as you help them.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|it was informational, and short and to the point.  It gives you what youo want to know with no filler.  as long as this is the workout you are loooking for.
B009GED3HS|5.0|i am a huge fan of the show i have not missed an episode since it started its one of the best comedys i have ever seen definantly deserves 5 stars just a great cast brilliant writing i could go on and on about this show i will miss it when it comes to an end
B0071XO8RA|5.0|To be honest I didn't know what to think about this ebook, I heard a radio interview with the author and how he self published this book and thought I would check it out and I am glad I did.  From the first chapter I found myself not wanting to put it down, stealing snippets of time in an airport, waiting in line to pick up my kids from school, to laying in bed reading it way past midnight.  The author's descriptions were filled with detail, I had no trouble imagining the scenes and events as they unfolded.  Great book!
B0091WMSNU|5.0|Leonardo's portrayal was riveting. I also loved Alec Baldwin...that short belly tie was hilarious!!  This is a must see - so check it out!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Awesome game very addictive simple yet challenging great for people of all ages I give this a 5 out of 5
B0064W65UM|3.0|The zoom isn't zoomed enough to easily view on the iPhone Kindle app. Needs to have a full screen zoom or ability to manually zoom in and out.
B009LGO88E|5.0|Works great with my resident evil 3ds game,cause celeb where ever I go,Gives me real street cred as pioneer gamer. If you got to wonder why you still wouldn't understand
B008KYOCA2|5.0|I got this app at first as a trial. I had been using the Google calendar that comes free with Android phones and tablets. I have a Google Nexus 7 Tablet and rely on it for keeping notes, important dates and general information. I had the Google calendar set up and I would add notes to the days when anything important happened so I would be able to retrieve the information months or years later when I was having trouble remembering.<br /><br />Then one day it was all gone!! After some heavy researching and seeing other Google Calendar App users that had lost all of their dates and memos, it turns out that the app not only backs up your calendar and notes to the Google servers, it syncs things, so if your app gets wiped out you can download it and get it all back.<br /><br />Here's the horrible catch! When the Google Calendar server goes down and it's one of the rare times when they loose data, the next time your app is supposed to sync, it sends it's fetch order to the server, compares the server copy to your copy, sees they aren't the same so it synchronizes your app to be the same as the Google server copy. In this case, totally devoid of info!<br /><br />I got about ten different calendar apps and tried them all out. I found out most of the calendar apps that are connected to the Google calendar servers do their backups the same way Google does, In fact, most of them just use the Google backup and sync and nothing else.<br /><br />This app is different! It backs up to its own server, once you set up the calendar and the sync and backup functions. In fact this app is a very smart app!! It will check it's server and the Google server and if perhaps the Google server has a blank copy of your calendar the app will see it's different and alert you to the problem!  It's the best calendar app for Android I have ever tried, it's easy to set up, easy to change and if you like little icons or different wallpapers, the Jorte store has a great selection and great low prices!<br /><br />To sum it up, try this calendar, if you like it you can pay for the customizations and get it to work your way, not someone else's idea of how a calendar app with backup and sync should be.
B00AIUUXHC|3.0|great app until it deleted my progress and started me over. normally, I'd have been frustrated and given it only one star. but the thing is...it's still a really great game. would be five stars if it wasn't for the restart. GLITCH NEEDS TO BE FIXED! (Kindle Fire)
B0098460O4|5.0|Jonathan's voice is amazing, and he's only 17, a young Pavarotti.  Their version of Everybody hurts is outstanding! Hopefully they will come out with another album soon
B00846F1YW|3.0|I really don't play it anymore but you might have to try for yourself cause not all of us like the same things ;)
1250007208|3.0|While this book is imaginative enough to keep me interested, the frequent misuse of the English langauge too often stops me cold.  Crowds mill about,they don't \\"mull\\".  A treatise isn't another word for treaty.  There's something like this every 3-4 pages.  What lesson is this for young readers?  I hope to goodness there's a second edition someday which corrects these blatant errors.  Hopefully the publisher was able to invest in better editing for Scarlet, after the success of Cinder.  Yes, I plan to read it, with my fingers crossed.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I use this app nearly daily.  I live in the desert and open my doors and windows when it is cool outside and TWC tells me when I need to close them up again.  Also I travel to other cities once in a while and want to know what the weather will be like there so I know what clothing to take.
B00AB7HESI|1.0|I got this game thinking it would be fun but it wouldn't let me get the items I typed in so if I'm doin somthin wrong please tell me
B005NKGEP2|2.0|For something to happen.  Anything. The main character is extremely unfulfilled as a housewife in Europe, but did nothing to change her situation. Mostly, I forced myself to get to the halfway point before giving up.  I'm not sure what sort of &#34;suspense&#34; I was hoping to find, but the book kept me as interested as golf on television.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|One of the most well written, well acted, interesting shows ever. Cannot wait for the next season. Had never seen it before this past February and caught up with Season 1 and 2 to watch Season 3. Cannot get enough of this show.
0399160450|4.0|Better than most techno-thrillers out there but it isn't viintage Clancy.  It seems he has lost some of his skills or there is just too much contribution by the &#34;other&#34; author.
B00AEBB8PQ|5.0|I bought this as a gift for a friend's birthday. She has been looking for it for a while. She loved the movie.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  It made me question a number of things and the ending left me absolutely stunned. Very interesting character development .  It was our book club selection.
B00BLGZDVS|3.0|It was just okay. I had heard all year how it was one of the best movies, but I didn't love it. The acting was great by all, but the story just didn't quite do it for me I guess. I do understand how others may love it though.
B001UV4XIS|4.0|I had not seen the final Harry Potter movie in the theater yet, so I figured I would buy the final movie on DVD and add it to my collection.  You gotta get this!!!
B00BSBY38A|4.0|It's was not easy to pull off this story ina believeable manner- but they did it 100%. You must see this!
B001UV4XHY|4.0|I am a fan of the Harry Potter movies and couldn't wait to get this DVD!<br />I would recommend this movie to everyone!  :)
0446573027|4.0|Picked up my 1st Baldacci book since the Oliver Stone series which I really enjoyed. Zero Day didn't disappoint, but didn't blow me away either.  It's above average & entertaining. I actually used it as a \\"filler\\" book. It satisfied my craving, yet deepened my appreciation for Brian Haig and his Sean Drummond books. I'm hope Haig continues the Drummond series because he takes the cake in these very similar story lines. Haig is the best. Lee Child's Jack Reacher series is very similar and good too.<br />In Zero Day, Baldacci's character, John Puller, is a salt-of the-earth combat vet & Army CID investigator who's assigned to a case in a rural West Virgina mining town where a high ranking Army Officer and family were murdered.  Puller has family baggage and combat PTSD, yet he's a cool guy who prefers the field over a suffocating CIA desk job. It's entertaining, suspenseful, well written, and develops excellent character chemistry between Puller and the local single, attractive policewoman who grew up there.  Baldacci does an excellent job detailing the history of the Government's nuclear technology, weapons, and the Cold War.  His research and detail is fantastic and very interesting.<br /><br />I'll definitely buy his 2nd \\"Puller\\" novel, The Forgotten, perhaps to fill the void left by these guys(in order of preference): Brian Haig/Sean Drummond, Vince Flynn/Mich Rapp, Daniel Silva/Gabriel Allon, and lastly Brad Thor/Scott Harvath.<br />BTW I've completely washed my hands of Nelson DeMille and John Cory -Im done! (I couldn't finish his previous 2 books before \\"The Panther\\" which I HOPED he'd rebound with; but after a few hundred pages, I pitched it to our building's communal \\"Laundry Room Book Case\\" because I couldn't take the annoying John Cory and his incessant, stupid, and over the top sarcastic banter. (you're done DeMille -strike three)<br /><br />I recommend Zero Day. It's a good travel or weekend read.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Supernatural continues to be well done and a show that I can consistently count on episode after episode, even during season eight.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I have rarely talked to anyone who hasn't seen and are fascinated with the series.  I haven't seen the third season yet, but I am looking forward to it.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|I was excited but a little nervous about the concept of Green Arrow as a tv show, but the show has been as good as I had hoped. Enough nods to the comic but no required knowledge to enjoy. I hope it keeps going strong; there's a lot more to be developed and Oliver Queen has a lot of work to continue!
B000N2HBSO|3.0|I got a little bored with this.  Lots of personality analysis, biographies of Lincoln and the important men around him.  I wasn't in the mood for all the detail, so I set it down.  I may go back to it later and find that I really like it.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|Tried of more than one movie at a time. Why not just come out with all the movies just three months apart.
B0094K1MH2|4.0|I caught only snipits of this movie but my nephews were very animated while watching. What I did see was fun and very well done. Most of the CG movies impress me as long as the stories are good and most of them are great adventures for the child in every one.
B000FC146C|5.0|The movie was good, the book is GREAT!!!  From start to finish, this is a book that is so enjoyable.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Clancy just writes it realistic.  His research is second to none.  The characters and story are always captivating and you want for more.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|The story makes this movie move and every one has done justice to the historical event. I would probably watch it again if I get a chance.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|The storyline is interesting.  I like that it has layers of activity and that it revolves around the woman, and what a difference she makes by keeping her cool.  The cast is compelling.  My favorite character is the investigator for the law firm.  She is the unsung lead character.  And I would love to be able to adapt her wardrobe!!  Amazing.  I also am impressed that Season 1 had something like 22 episodes in a season.  Lots to enjoy.  I enjoyed this feature of Amazon Prime very much.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|If you love the show you will love this CD!! All the best songs are on this album! Great gift for all Nashville fans!
B0017QSZW6|5.0|I couldn't stop watching this great series of historical significance. . It was so interesting and informative, and the acting was exceptional.
B001ANSS5K|4.0|Great book,even better story. It does leave a bit to be desired buy overall I enjoyed it. John green does it again
B00B1MJ02K|5.0|I have never enjoyed anything so much as I have this CD.  Andrea Bocelli is the most amazing man I have ever seen.  His common personality, along with the voice God gave to him, are something I thank God for letting me be a part of.  I saw the Portofino concert on PBS. I was dumbstruck it was so incredible.  I would give anything if they would release that on DVD for sale to the public.  I would recommend it to anyone, any age. And thank God for David Foster. I hope they will do another album together of Italian love songs, sung in Italian.  It has opened up a whole new world to me.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|His voice is wonderful! He sings such beautiful music. I could listen to him all day! A must have for a romantic evening!
B000HT3PPG|5.0|This is my all time favorite Christmas movie, which I watch every now and then through the year. I comes with two dvd's the original movie in black and white and in color. Makes a wonderful gift to enjoy for years to come.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Better than the movie. I can hardly wait for the following novel.  I will be on the lookout for it.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|What can on say about 'It's a Wonderful Life' that hasn't already been said. I purchased it because I had a VHS of it and well it was getting pretty warn out. This 2-disc set includes the brand-new color version as well as the beautifully restored black and white version. A wonderful gift to give and of course to own and enjoy with your family and friends.
B005PK56TA|5.0|Better than my mothers stories (Soaps Operas)! Just enough mystery with a dash of \\"No they didn't!\\"  I love the fact that Moira can be seen in 2 different lights. This is a must watch.
B0097EWK3A|3.0|Was enjoying the game until I got almost to the end when a technical issue  arose and now I can't complete the game. Need to contact customer service to see if I can get a refund!
B004VRL4BM|5.0|i like this series
B007SGM084|5.0|I absolutely loved this! A great read, kept me engrossed through all 3 book's. I highly recommended this story! Wonderful!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|It works.  I like how it keeps track of the numbers your adding. It just about fills the screen.  I'd like it to have more options/functions. To be able to do more with it. Otherwise it's a nice simple calculator.
B00BI73CVI|2.0|I'm a huge fan of musicals and this looked like it was going to be amazing. They sang every single line, lines that just aren't even meant to be sung. They needed to just have a few lines after or before each song of dialogue. When it was all over I felt like I watched a 2 hour trailer. The music is not good enough to encompass the entirety of the film AND Russell Crowe can't sing. I love the individual elements that made up this movie, but when amalgamated, resulted in a less than satisfactory experience. I found myself quite disheartened by this turn of events.
B005COO1X6|5.0|I bought it because I am a life long King fan. It is a story about a young boy on an adventure that has leads into danger that leaves him wisened beyond his years. It was a page turner from the start. If you loved his early works or a Dean Knootz type books you will enjoy this story.
B0030V0PEW|4.0|It is  astonishing  how  a simple idea can  be  so  effective,<br />Dr  Gawande gives a  good  history as  to why  this  idea  was needed and  emerged.<br /> He  also  explains  how  it  was  put into place and  the  problems  people  over came to  make it  effective The  honesty of  his  initial  skepticism verified  that  he  also  had to  work at  making this  a viable  tool.<br /> At times some of the examples  seemed  repetitious, but  the  story  moved  along  well.<br /> I would  recommend this  book and  idea.
0385349947|4.0|Recently I was sitting in a boardroom meeting at my Fortune 50 employer and looked around the room noticing that I was the only woman among 30 men. It wasn't that way five years ago and I began to wonder what happened. I also noticed that I had gone to leadership school with two of the VPs some eight years ago but I was not yet an executive. Why not?<br /><br />I mentioned this to a colleague and she recommended Sheryl's book. While on a business trip I raced through the book and with each turn of a page experienced a whole range of emotion from outrage regarding the statics about women and advancement to dissapointed that some of us have chosen a different path and then a touch of regret that I haven't done more about this situation for my own sake and that of my female co-workers.<br /><br />I had a spectacular career role model if not life model. My grandmother retired in the 1960s from a high ranking position in the Treasury Department. She was a successful and serious career woman. I would sit with her at her make-up table every morning before she started on her long commute to DC. She would leave the house at the crack of dawn in her tailored dress, pill box hat and man's briefcase. My grandfather, a self-employed handyman who could fix or build anything, was her life partner. She was an amazing cook, decorator, seamstess, hostess and caregiver. She was a remarkable woman.<br /><br />So here I am 50 something with some twenty years of technical management exerience and have realized enough is enough. It's time for a personal change.<br /><br />Thanks for the inspiration to \\"Lean In\\". It's never too late.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Once you read this book you'll be dying to read the next 2! Just love every character! Need a break, sit down & read this book! You'll be happy you did!
B0017SWPXY|4.0|I appreciate my opposable thumbs and ability to speak, something that Enzo dreams of having in this touching story about his owner's life and difficulties. It was nice to read philosophical dog thoughts.
B00BF11STU|5.0|If this is your type of movie it will keep you interested till the end without getting anyone upset with the whole political climate
B00B8WXFWE|4.0|I at my age, have never been into the \\"Boy Bands\\" of the 90's, but after hearing a couple songs from their NEW \\"10\\" CD and listening to their story of the comeback, I purchased it to give to my sister for her birthday as she was familiar with them.  I of course had to open and download the songs before I gave it to her and I must say I'm really enjoying it.  I'm tempted to listen to their earlier music...
B0000VCZK2|5.0|Great value for all my alien movies. looked at many other options this was the best package.A definate must for alien geeks.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Well written and engaging. It keep me interested from start to finish. I would read more books by this author.
B00000K0DT|1.0|I saw this piece of garbage after my friends said it was the greatest movie ever!  They couldn't believe that I had never seen this movie before, and I admit I was feeling left out.  The actors in this movie I actually like a lot in other films, but NOT this film. Now don't get me wrong there are plenty of worse films out there, but this is by far the most over-rated.<br /><br />But then again I have dumb friends. ;-)
B009KHDT0C|5.0|Even though this was available in stores, the price was better on Amazon and I didn't have to leave my house and fight holiday crowds. LOVE IT!
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|If every human being followed these four agreements, we would live in peace on the planet.  A simply, perfect formula for self-actualization.
B007P7UF0G|5.0|This film is a favorite with my boyfriend. I gave it to him as an early Christmas present. I never would have been able to find this old version in a store anywhere.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I love d this book! I can't wait to read the next one! Christian Grey is a sick twisted puppy lol.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is a great show to watch. Have no complaints. Can't wait to see the upcoming episodes and season 4.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I can't stop playing this game,I play this at our country fair, it's so much fun,I wish all the coins would stop falling off the side to lol that's part of the game
B000FC2KL0|5.0|Seriously this book offers such a different perspective on life, it's really entertaining and thought provoking. Loved every minute of it
0679882820|3.0|I think this is cute for learning sounds, but my 13 month old will not sit and listen to it no matter what I try.
1451668945|5.0|This book will keep you reading. You do not want to put it down. There are hints about what will be coming but just enough to keep you reading.
B000FA675C|5.0|I had seen the movie and thought it was excellent. Decided to get the book because it's always better and it is.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|This is a good show, the characters are believeable, story line and acting is good. I hope the other seasons continue in the same manner.
B0064QNS62|4.0|I Like a challenge and learning my new Kindle Fire and this Game at the same time Is a Challenge. Thanks
B0015DROBO|4.0|I liked the book very much, and read the other two of the trilogy just after finishing each. I was surprised about the story created by S.Larsson. Really creative. It is difficult to writte that kind of relationships between the characters and at the same time keep the mistery till the end, or book by book. Suspense, drama, human relationships, and thriller.  A very good reading to enjoy. Don't see the american movie, it is a bad simplification, and the characters lack of humanity, they are shown as heroes.
B009IH0ICG|5.0|I am a big fan of the full size Weber charcoal starter. I have one for the house and one I take camping. The compact starter takes up less room and does a great job starting smaller amounts of charcoal. I plan to use it as my travel starter as well as for lighting a smaller amount of charcoal to add to the grill when cooking.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I love to read well written stories that hold my attention and keep me wanting to read just one more page. This was not a predictable story line and was thought provoking. I love how things are not completely black and white and forces you to ask yourself what would you do? The characters are all very rich and have many dimensions. Highly recommend this series. I am looking forward to the rest of the Silo Series!
B0038NN3B4|5.0|This updated volume on the Atkins diet gives you all the tools you need to understand the science behind the Atkins diet as well as everything you need to know to get started.

B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is the best game EVER!!!!! I play it almost everyday and I love connecting to other people's games, I have many different houses that I've  made.I love minecraft!!! I have so many iron ingots and gold, along with coal and diamonds. I plan on playing Minecraft for a while, especially now that I have gotten Minecraft on my computer!
1613823649|3.0|I've given most books by G.K. Chesterton high marks in the past, because I like his wit, and frankly, his orthodoxy.  I was also impressed by his sharp understanding of the errors in the thinking of the time in which he lived, and his talent for humor and rhetoric, and especially his admiration of Saint Thomas Aquinas, who single-handedly saved me from a ten-year run of agnosticism.<br /><br />Nevertheless, sometimes, his prose gets decidedly purple; more so than is good for it.  I just don't complain about it because he uses the prose to outline some very clear and provable truth.<br /><br />Orthodoxy, though considered by many to be Chesterton's magnum opus, is, in fact, one of my least favorite of his books, and the main reason is that he demonstrates so clearly that it is prejudices and preferences; not reason, on which his view of the world rests.<br /><br />I'm sorry to have to say this, because we share so much in common, but in the early parts of the book, Chesterton begins saying that he is assuming that he's speaking to people who want the world to be dramatic and romantic, rather than a system.  He starts talking about lessons that he learned from classic fairy tales, and about the joys in monotony that babies seem to experience, and none of this has anything to do with logic or reason.  If I could ask Chesterton about these passages, I would put it in this way.<br /><br />\\"Suppose that you met a person who had never heard any of the old fairy tales, never heard a poem or a song, and discovered joy, only in those rare instances in which he was victorious over something.  How would you defend your world view to this person?  What frame of reference would you use?  What frame of reference would you -be able- to use?\\"<br /><br />I fear things have gotten much worse since Chesterton's time, in that children no longer hear the instructive fairy tales, and no longer have much experience of the world outside their doors.  Because of this, the process of \\"lettingfresh air in,\\" as Chesterton puts it; letting it into their thoughts is not so simple as reminding them of their childhood.  Their childhood, very often, did not contain any recognition of the things that make life worth living.<br /><br />However, as the book progresses, Chesterton extends this problem, making aesthetic claims as though they were truth claims.<br /><br />In chapter 4, he claims that we should be grateful for snow being white, because it could have been black, and for roses being red because they could have been blue.  The problem is, I don't see any reason to agree with him on this, simply because my aesthetics differ from his.  Aesthetics are not objective statements, but expressions of how certain stimuli make one feel.  If white snow and red roses make him happy, then good for him, but this is not a statement of fact, nor is it constant for everyone.  I, for example, love red roses, but would -prefer- black snow to white.  I just dislike the color white.  It provokes unpleasant emotions in me.  So what?  That proves nothing, and for the most part, it effects none of the choices I make, simply because I choose not to let it.<br /><br />In the same chapter, he seems to praise monotony, or at least, to claim that it's better, since small babies seem to enjoy it so much.  Then, he criticizes naturalism for being monotonous.  Clearly there's a problem with this.  I'd say monotony is the least of naturalism's problems, of which there are many.<br /><br />Chapter 4, paragraph 31; Chesterton claims that people choose which emotions to have.  This is false.  People choose which emotions to -express,- but the emotions which you have are completely beyond your control.<br /><br />He then goes -far- off topic, defending \\"smallness\\" as being inherently more lovable and romantic than \\"bigness,\\" and again, using only personal sentiments as his evidence.  Needless to say, I was unconvinced, and even somewhat angered, as it seems, to me, totally irrelevant to the subject of the book, and unlikely to provoke the reaction that he wishes.  The fact that I personally find smallness repulsive, and bigness enchanting is a side issue, though it is, in fact, one of my primary reasons for being willing to listen to the gospel message of dying to this life in pursuit of the next; the pearl of great price is not worth pursuing because of its smallness.<br /><br />Chesterton uses the last few paragraphs of chapter 4 to try to outline why the need to practice economics is a fun and romantic need, by comparing it to Robinson Crusoe being marooned on an island with only a few items surviving the shipwreck.  However, there are several reasons why this comparison fails.<br /><br />1. Sure, economics can be part of an adventure, but only when there seems to be some chance of losing, or of winning.  Crusoe had the chance to do either, and that's what makes his experiences an \\"adventure.\\"<br /><br />2. Simply because something -can- be fun, it doesn't follow that it -will- be.  I doubt that Crusoe thought it was very much fun being shipwrecked, regardless of how much we may enjoy reading about his escapades from a safe, warm armchair, which brings me to the next reason.<br /><br />3. There is a difference between fantasy and reality.  We may have great fun watching a movie about a boxer who's badly injured in a fight, and has to work his way back to the top, but that doesn't mean that it would be fun to -be- badly injured, or that bad injuries are somehow good because of this.<br /><br />4. Even if something -is- fun, it doesn't follow that it's in any way related to drama or romance, or even to risk.  If you can appreciate having small tools at your disposal for large tasks, you can also appreciate having large tools for even larger tasks.<br /><br />5. None of this is relevent.  It's all subjective aesthetics, which we don't all share, and since that's the whole message in this case, if you don't already share his aesthetics, you won't gethis message.<br /><br />Chapter 5 opens with a cursory glance at the concepts of pessimism and optimism, which, unfortunately, he gets completely wrong.  He remarks that he thinks optimists are people who think everything is good except pessimists, and pessimists are people who think everything is bad except themselves.  Again; problems.<br /><br />1. Many optimists (and pessimists) think that pessimists are good.<br /><br />2. Many pessimists -loath- themselves.<br /><br />3. Pessimism and optimism, even as abstractions, are not about whether you think things are good or bad.  Rather, they're about how often you -dwell on- the things that you think are good, versus the ones you think are bad.  A man may recognize that his neighbors never talk to him, except to scorn, that his government is run by a tyrant, than the businesses that surround him are all using their money for evil purposes, and that he himself is friendless, relationless, childless and destitute, and yet, still be an optimist, because he comforts himself by reminding himself of the things that -are not- horrible, even if those things are mere dreams.<br /><br />4. Pessimism and optimism are not real people-types.  They're abstractions invented by psychologists to try to keep track of trends in psychology.  It would be a mistake to assume that any human being is a -pure- optimist or a -pure- pessimist.<br /><br />5. Again, what does this have to do with philosophy?  Nothing, as far as I can tell.<br /><br />Next comes the point where Chesterton begins to speak as though we have some obligation to be loyal to the universe, by our very nature.  This sounds suspiciously like \\"My universe, right or wrong,\\" which he seems to admit later, strangely.  Then, in Chapter 5, Paragraph 6, he launches a broadside attack against pessimists, claiming them to be \\"candid friends.\\"  This is clearly not always true, since often, pessimists will be very candid about -not- being your friend, especially when you criticizethem for being pessimists.<br /><br />He becomes more and more derogatory towards pessimists as the chapter continues, calling them traitors to the universe and the like.  It's just garbage by this point.  None of this has anything to do with sanity or philosophy.  He's just coming down on his least favorite type of personality.  For example, he claims that pessimists don't love the things they chastise.  I know for fact this is not true of all pessimists.  Frankly, I expected better.<br /><br />Next, Chesterton defines the difference between \\"good\\" and \\"bad\\" optimism; that bad optimism leads to laziness and complacence, while good optimism leads to eager action.  It's an important point to make, and I'm glad he made it, but in a way, it also serves to further outline his mistakes regarding pessimism.  After all, if optimism can motivate a person well or badly, why can't pessimism do the same?  Why is it only optimism which has a \\"good\\" version, while all pessimists are lumped into the same pile?<br /><br />However, midway through chapter 6 (paragraph 16,) Chesterton begins defending the faith again, and the book picks up!  He includes several brilliant examples of accusations thrown at the church, and how they contradict one another, as well as a fantastic interpretation of the \\"lion will lay down with the lamb\\" passage in paragraph 27, which seems to imply that there's room for more than one type of personality in Christianity, in defiance of his previous remarks.<br /><br />However, it doesn't last, and by the end of chapter 7, he's singing the praises of levity again, and trying to claim that the saints would back him up (I can think of at least a dozen of the great saints of the Church who were as serious-minded as IRS agents.)  If he wants to claim that the faith has plenty of room for those who don't take themselves too seriously, I would say that claim is true, but the way he's talking, it almost sounds as though serious individuals have little or no place in the kingdom of God.  I hope I don't need to explain why that's false.<br /><br />Nevertheless, Chapter 8 opens up, and once again, we're back to strong critiques of anti-Christian arguments, then in Chapter 9, arguments for why doubt is unjustified in the case of belief in God.  These chapters are -really good.-<br /><br />I guess my conclusion with regard to the book is a sort of \\"halfway\\" conclusion.  It gets points just for being orthodox, but I have to say that I think the book meandered somewhat between legitimate defenses of the faith, and irrelevant aesthetics, with which I very much disagree.  Statements of aesthetics and outlook (positive vs. negative) are not matters of faith or morals, and don't really matter when it comes to believing in God, or being a Christian.  As long as you take it in that context, I can't imagine this book's \\"low points\\" doing you any harm, and I do recommend the other half of it, because, as I said, the \\"high points\\" are -very- high.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is amazing!! I am a level 30 and plan on playing this game for a while, I love racing my dragons on the Dragon track and breeding all sorts of new dragons!!! I have the Perch of Kairos and I now have the Kairos dragon which helps tremendously when I need to speed up time on my islands. The only thing I would change is when you use the Kairos dragon, that it would also speed up the time for the colleseum.

B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I liked it for the action and the drama-- also the costumes and background were definitely eye catching.  It also followed the book quite closely so will anxiously be awaiting the sequel.
B00BEZTMQ8|4.0|This is a great movie, even tho Peter Jackson did make some of the scenes a bit too long.  Still the movie is a keeper.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Excellent quality video and audio. We will us this system often. Very easy to use on Roku system. a a
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Loved this game at first fright  keeps you going further and further great story and graphics looking forward to a sequel
B00B3HJMLM|3.0|It is difficult for me to find fault with Luke Bryan but, this CD sound the same on every track but, one.  The music, the lyrics and the theme.  I understood it would be party songs but, good grief they literally sounded as if one went into the other.
B008TRUDAS|1.0|Started out okay then progressively moved to predicable, juvenile, and finally rediculous when I realized they are trying to con me into buying her next 202 novels to follow the continuing trials and tribulations of Will and Lake. Give me a break!  Now that's slam poetry!!
B008133MDK|5.0|If you love Sherlock Holmes from Jerremy Brett version, you can still love this!<br />Very impressive. Actualy sheds light from another direction on this wonderful litarary character...
B004LROUW2|5.0|Fantastico, encantador, enorme. Seguro proximo premio nivel de literatura. Alcanza a transportar a ese mundo de dos lunas, recomendable mucho.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|Like I said, installed first time with no issues on my Kindle Fire (HD-free). Never played Scribblenauts before but I love it. You can be as creative and weird as you want when solving puzzles. Jetpacks and chainsaws and octopuses...oh my!!
055338466X|4.0|This book is a very accessible exposition of scientific and philosophical concepts (and metaphysical ones too, although the authors may be somewhat reluctant to admit that term) that occupy an enquiring mind. These questions and quandaries include such enquiries as why is there something rather than nothing? Why do we exist? What is the nature of reality? Hawking and Mlodinow do a brilliant job, with admirable literary virtuosity, of covering considerable ground within the space of less than two hundred pages. In terms of content, this book could be viewed as an update (much more succinct) of Brian Greene's \\"The Fabric of the Cosmos\\" (published in 2004). Both books cover most of current significant developments in physics and cosmology which have a bearing on our attempt to answers the ultimate question of the origin (and sustaining) of the universe and ourselves.<br /><br />Greene's book, however, basically sticks to the science and adopts a more clinical stance while viewing these issues and is therefore not handicapped by arguments around the existence of a designer or creator. Hawking and Mlodinow, on the other hand, make it clear at the very outset that \\"this book is rooted in scientific determinism\\", setting the scene for what follows. The latent message of the book is that we do have a \\"grand design\\", but there is no need for a designer, though. Instead, a grand scientific tapestry consisting of concepts and discoveries like the multiverse and M-Theory underlies and sustains this grand design.<br /><br />The authors do not openly disparage origin theories of a theological bent. Nevertheless, the contents of the book never fail to  imply that their grand design could be the only answer to the question of why the world exists and why we exist. It is rather ironic that Hawking wondered in his earlier \\"A Brief History of Time\\" about \\"What is it that breathes fire into the equations and makes a universe for them to describe? Is the unified theory so compelling that it brings about its own existence? Or does it need a creator?\\" There was perhaps an element of doubt - and a willingness to consider other answers - in Hawking's mind when he wrote these words. It appears that Hawking (in collaboration with Mlodinow) has - a quarter century after the initial publication in 1988 of \\"A Brief History of Time\\" - has acquired considerable certainty in the veracity of his arguments and an attendant disdain for other viewpoints. This is a pity because even such great thinkers like Hume and Kant have expressed more than a modicum of doubt as to whether reason alone can answer all our questions. As Jim Holt points out in his book, \\"Why Does the World Exist\\", Hume felt that we will never be able to address that question as the answer \\"could never be grounded in our experience\\". Kant felt that such an attempt to explain may \\"involve an illegitimate extension of the concepts we use to structure the world of our experience... to a reality transcending this world.\\"
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I am a very firm believer that the book is always better than the show or movie and don't feel any different about Game of Thrones, there are parts in the season that were changed or completely left out which is understandable seeing as they had to fit a 900 page book into 10 episodes. But other than that i was glued to the TV the entire season. I recommend reading the book first if you want the entire story though!
B0081BU42O|4.0|On the flip side, not much is new here.<br /><br />But that said, IMB remains the unparalleled writer that he is. If this was the Culture he would be Ue class mind. Unclassifiable, eccentric but, in the end, brilliant and a winner!
B003PDMMYQ|3.0|this story is slow getting started. 3/4 of the way through for me before the magic of Umberto Eco's skill in language and human emotion kicked in. He writes a passage on pure love that is well worth slogging through the ponderous first half of the book to get to. An average read for fans who have read all his other stuff first, as this is not the best example of his work.
B0052CK5PQ|5.0|Absolutely everyone in the world should read this book - it would start a revolution. It's raw, emotional, insightful and oh so funny!
B004GUSG4M|5.0|An excellent suspenseful novel. The writing is engaging.  The author put me into the mind of the main character. An ending I did not see coming. A very good story told by a very good storyteller.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|I love this show so much that I write a weekly review of new episodes for a fan website! Downloading these episodes and watching them on my kindle is a great way to immerse myself in the story! Downloads are quick and easy too!
0062082353|5.0|It is a good read, and it is raw and honest about training and life for a Navy Seal.<br />But I believe everyone should read it for a first hand account of the type of war Iraq was for our military.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I loved the action and drama, cast and writers make this show a great thrillride. Bring on next season! Bring out your dead.
B00BBA6FOI|5.0|I had very few expectations when I first e-picked the book. But the first few pages into the book and I found myself highlighting many lines. I also realized that my neck started hurting with the vigorous nodding in agreement of the many situations in the book. The narrative stayed with me and I started observing how many lady colleagues sat at the table, how many raised their hands. It was interesting to hear how many of the male colleagues were equal partners and how many... Well never mind!<br /><br />This book has helped me respect my mother and my boss (at work) a lot more and I continue to be indebted to them. It's a must read for everybody.. Irrespective of gender
B005LAII44|5.0|This is a live action version of a cartoon series.  This isn't intended as a thought-provoking, Academy Award winning contender.  This isn't \\"Saving Private Ryan.\\"  Taken for what it's meant to be -- it works perfectly.  There's plenty of cool hardware, cool villains, fun action scenes, etc.  It's an action cartoon come to life and it works on that level.  And yes, it's better than the first G.I. Joe movie.<br /><br />It's maybe not a true 5 star movie, but I'll give it 5 stars to offset the negative reviews.
B00BHU261S|4.0|I wasn't sure I was going to like this movie to start with; but part way through, I decided I did. It wasn't quite what I'd expected; but it has a good cast, and I would recomend it.
B00AB7HESI|4.0|I own the original with my long untouched DS. I have been waiting for the game to hit Android and so far has not been a disappointment. I am enjoying it. Only issue is that I can't think of anything when I can enter almost anything. Ha ha.
B00BF123WG|4.0|I feel a little generous giving this 4 stars - it was ok, but not as good as I had expected. I would recomend it, but it's not fantastic.
B00992CF6W|4.0|come on add vilage and cheat  mode and fire you should add more mobs potions add the nether portal<br />rain snow fall and why is gold so freaken hard to find<br />make it easier to find AND A SPECIALY BUCKETS and lava should be easy to find enderman more ores pleasssssssssssssssssssss creeper and when you die you should always have your stuff and i like minecraft but add all theses things and CAKE MILK
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This was an absolutelly spell binding book.  I can hardly wait for the next volume to be published.  Follett is an excellent writer
B003U4UOP4|5.0|Enjoyed this show. It has a fresh approach on the lost on an island theme, the mysterious island reminds me of the village in the old show; the prisoner. The characters are interesting and engaging.
B00123KEX2|4.0|This album was the last in the line of the &#34;classic&#34; VH style of their early years. This is one of VH's most rocking album in all of their discography and the VH brother's really show what their made of on this album. There were only a couple of &#34;hits&#34; on this album which probably why it gets over looked by average VH fan. Bottom line, if you the &#34;classic&#34; DLR led Van Halen with blistering guitar work, then you will like this album. The only reason why I didn't give this album 5 stars is because there really isn't a lot of variation on the album and a lot of the songs seem to blend together.<br /><br />Stand Out Tracks:<br />And The Cradle Will Rock<br />Everybody Wants Some<br />Romeo Delight<br />Take Your Whiskey Home
B009KEN87O|5.0|Love it. Takes me back to the old days. Lots of variety and challenges. Not too ready. Not too hard.
B009PEPML4|2.0|I had heard how moving and awesome this album was so I figured I would give it shot. The songs are so long that the samples don't really help, but I went in with an open mind. All I can say is that I don't get. There are a few cool parts, but for the most part I found this album to be a total bore that never seemed to go any where. I really don't get the whole Post Rock genre and I really didn't enjoy this album at all. Obviously, some people really enjoy this band and album, so feel free to give it a shot but just don't be surprised if you don't get it either.
B00821OX98|1.0|I saw the pilot episode after a couple of friends recommended it to me.  On screen there's a lot of production value, and for the most part well acted.  As a whole, I just felt this was cobbled together invasion stories I've seen before, but those were done better and at a smaller scale.  I'm a fan of Noah Wyle, he played one of my favorite characters in ER.  But as much talent the guy has, there isn't much for him to work with here. Without getting into too many spoilers, there was a lot of family drama I really didn't care about.  I'm not saying that family drama is bad, but I need to feel empathy for the characters beyond the fact that they're &#34;father and son&#34;.  All in all, I can see why people have been recommending it to me; It's a heavy sci-fi environment that is competently visually conveyed.  But the bottom line for me is  I feel the writing needs to be as good as the bells and whistles.  It's apparent that their is a lot of money put on screen, now they just need to make sure that it works on paper without the cash.
B0047WJ12K|3.0|This movie is just ok because I found it very hard to follow and at times a little boring. Not my favorite genre.
6304936362|4.0|Some years ago I purchased this movie in VHS, and I thought I would up grade to DVD. I love air plane movies and this one is great.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I'm half way through this book and SO much resonates with me - both as a mom of toddlers and as a senior executive who travels regularly. I highly recommend it for all women, but certainly for us moms who are dedicated to our family AND our career!  There has been some negative press around this book - but frankly, I don't agree. Thanks Sheryl Sandberg.
B000ID1J5E|5.0|The first time I saw this movie was on tv and I wondered how much of it was cut, so I ordered it in VHS. What a great action movie, the cast is terrific and I also love to raft. I decided to up grade to DVD, WOW what a difference. I have watched it at least 10 times.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Great book with a bazillion 1980's references for those 80's geeks like me.<br /><br />The story is that of a young man, poor with very few friends. He spends most of his time in the OASIS, an online video game/world that the most of the world spends their time on due to the terrible nature of planet earth at that stage.<br /><br />The young fella ends on a quest when the creator/owner of the OASIS dies and sets up a treasure hunt style video game within the OASIS, the winner taking over his estate and running of the OASIS.<br /><br />It is packed full of great fun, video game references, movie references and beyond. I loved the book.<br /><br />The only parts that kind of annoyed me was the average romantic scenes, which at time were cringe worthy especially in dialogue. The only other thing was at times I wasn't sure if I was reading a YA book or an adults book. It just seemed that it would be aimed at people like me, who were pre-early teen in the 80's. I doubt any YA kids would even know 99% of the references, but it read more like a YA book half of the time.<br /><br />Either way, great book - get it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like the way this version plays - straightforward without unnecessary options. Gives me something not too stupid to do when I have a few free minutes.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|He is one of my favorite artists. His music appeals to multiple generations in my family - we can all listen!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Haven't read the rest, the best in man can come out with a cause, &#34;BUTLER&#34;! Next time tell me what you pay per word, if you want me to be a critic.
B007RI56NY|5.0|Once again, Train makes me happy! I listen as I drive and there is no chance that I'll get annoyed with any bad drivers on the road. They made me smile.
B0064QNS62|2.0|I got this game as a free AOTD. It initially looked pretty neat, and I played for a few levels. But the controls need work. It takes a lot of precision to make sure you hit the correct buttoms. Also, there are several ways to control the character, a jump button and pushing up both do the same thing... kinda weird.<br /><br />Overall a fair game, would be much better with the controls improved.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Being a follower of this drama, of course I enjoyed watching the season finale. One of the best dramas to come out in a long time.
B009KEN87O|5.0|I got this game as a free AOTD. Played the game all the way through on Easy and started the Hard mode.<br /><br />A few unexpected levels are tetris (You shoot the blocks to make them fit) and pong (your ship has paddle in front of it) type games. Most of the levels are pretty easy, but does get harder with a few of the bosses and some of the higher levels.<br /><br />Overall a good game and will keep you shooting for a while!
0399230033|5.0|A delightful story that will be great to read to your baby at bedtime.  The quality of the book was first rate and the colorful illustrations were great.  Older kids can read this to younger ones and laugh at the fact that the aminals pulled the wool over the zoo keepers eyes.  A very sweet book.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|A great book that I've always been meaning to read, but never got around to.  Finally I found it for free and read it soon after.  Great to read the differences in the book to the movie.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Fun, interesting show.  Love the interaction between the stars, and the search for clues.  Look forward to each episode.  Keep it coming,
B00BHMETKC|5.0|loved it loved it loved had me on the edge of my seat, I will recommend this movie to anyone
B00026ZG10|5.0|One of my favorite movies to pull up and watch when I need some laughs.  Arnold and Jamie Lee are so good together in this one.  Some lines and situations having me laughing out loud every time I watch it.  Watching Jamie trying to dance seductively in the hotel room is a real hoot.
B00BF11STU|5.0|I found it to be very intense, interesting and the acting was terrific would definitely recommend to my friends and family
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Downton at it's increasingly best!  Wonderful continuance of the popular PBS Show...makes the viewer yearning for more.  Season four is much anticipated!
B004NS710C|2.0|Boring and predictable. This film is formulaic claptrap. Easily avoidable. Exercise your intellect with stimulating, thought provoking films other than this one.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Such a great look at what it might be like!  Adventure to some place new in the &#34;golden&#34; years of life after retirement.  Makes the over 60 crowd take a second look at adventuring beyond their comfort zone and take on the world head first.  Some with anxiety, some with the outlook that life is an adventure...don't get left behind.
B009O2XY12|4.0|Hope others like this as much as me. I enjoy playing games throughout the day and this one works great!
0385349947|5.0|This book has such a great impact on women in business.  Such a great empowering read for women just entering the work force and for those wishing to improve their outlook on how to find out just where, when or if they wish to pursue the brass ring.  Insightful look into what is right for YOU, and how to achieve happiness and balance with work or life decisions.
B0054SMIH6|5.0|I like that the movie held my attention, and it revealed how the truth will always set you free.  Matthew McConaughey and Marisa Tomei are among my favorite actors and I loved both of their performances in The Lincoln Lawyer.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is a very good game but some games are hard on Here but still very fun. I wish I could get points faster though
B00AB12TEI|5.0|I love when people can simplify the complex - Tim Clark has done that with this book.  The book is really a career coach in a book by giving you a set of tools for self discovery and aligning your passions and talents into how you make your living and spend your time purposefully.  Plus it's fun and colorful.  Everyone that I have shared or given the book to enjoys even flipping through the pages.<br /><br />Tim takes the 9 box framework called the Business Model Canvas and applies it to your life and work in Your Personal Canvas and then provides a series of exercises that enable the process to unfold.  You get to do exercises without feeling like you have exercising.  And the results yield valuable insight to help you live a more integrated life that is fulfilling.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|Nothing to really say other than that. Works great with kindle fire HD. Graphics are good especially with all the great colors. Great app.
B0045MRLCE|5.0|This downloaded perfect and conveniently to my Kindle... love this CD!  Would recommend it to friends and family.  You get it &#34;on the spot&#34;!
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Stayed pretty true to the book and was entertaining throughout. I only paused it twice for breaks! Very enjoyable video.
B004P4S4NM|5.0|This downloaded perfect and conveniently to my Kindle... love this CD!  Would recommend it to friends and family.  You get it &#34;on the spot&#34;!
B0029Z7Y2G|5.0|got the movie for my daughter, but i love these movies too. got the movie fast and it was in great condition.
B008VBYN80|5.0|A great way to relax! The animation is terrific! I don't want to stop!  I am sure I will be spending a few bucks on this one. With the free download, I don't mind spending $$ to help me level up faster! Thanks.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Great storyline with characters that had me crossing my fingers that they would get their happy ending.  Wished that we had gotten another chapter to see what happened after the conclusion of the story.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|I like the game but I wish they gave you what the object of the game is and how to play it
B00AL6SM0S|5.0|With all the sets being released for Wagner's bicentennial, this is definitely one to have. These Wagner singers and conductors got to the heart of Wagner in a way which hasn't been performed well for decades. All but one of these sets have been released over the years (the new one is the 1938 TRISTAN with Flagstad and Melchior under Bodanzky - which is why I bought the set). The 1936 GOTTERDAMMERUNG and the 1938 PARSIFAL (not included here but available on Myto) have always had poor sound but these magnificent performances are worth the aural effort. A must have for any fan of Wagner and great singing.<br /><br />I noted another review commenting that the sound of the SIEGFRIED is better than in earlier releases. I have to agree as I have two earlier CD releases. In a note, none of these are in digital sound but a little experience of listening past the surface noise will be well-rewarded. As I've told audiences, great recordings in poor sound are still great but mediocre ones in digital are still mediocre.<br /><br />The one bad note is the packaging with the tight paper sleeves. Obviously someone at Sony didn't think we'd be playing these too often. Was this the best Sony could do?<br /><br />By the way, at the time I ordered this set it was less expensive from the Amazon UK website (and it still was today). You might want to check it out. The Norbeck & Peters website charges $100 for this set so I recommend you buy it here or the UK website.
B00C1BUYX4|4.0|This was a fairly good movie definitely worth watching. Gave different perspective than what was tought in school. However was a little slow at times thats why I gave 4 stars.
B007QDNKQA|3.0|typical suspense movie but still enjoyable with lots of action. Wahlberg is good in this role. no surprises but you'll be entertained
B00BJA2VFW|4.0|Needed to be quite a bit longer. I've been playing it for about a week and I'm almost done. I like big fish games and this was is pretty good for a first on the kindle. Like I said, only complaint is that it's too short.
B004LOMB2Q|2.0|this is probably great product for some people but I use a calendar already for reminder and email for notes or Work
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I found this app and tried it because I sell on eBay and needed a quick way to see my auctions without having to log in to the eBay system and then going to My eBay. This easy to use app makes it a breeze to manage my auctions away from home!
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|It is a fun game. Times out sometimes. Wish you had a little more time to play each level. Will not sync with facebook.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|Simply just a great fun game to play! Challenging and exasperating with many &#34;you really have to think moments&#34;! Try it and you will be hooked!
B006P96PAO|5.0|This is the best Christian movie that my wife and I have ever seen.  The acting was first rate. The story line was real life. It was a good quality family movie.
B004UIOUHC|4.0|I chose this browser because I did not like the one that came with my tablet and because of reviews I saw on it. Fast, easy to learn and intuitive. Would have given it 5 stars, but some of the menus - especially on eBay - don't let me do a category search
B000ICKPOQ|5.0|If you were a fan of Stargate SG-1, then this is an excellent follow on.  Atlantis is a follow on to the gate and ancient weapons platform that was found in Antarctica in SG-1 and once they step through to the Pegasus galaxy then the adventure takes on a whole new path with new challenges.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|I had to try this one as I REALLY liked the original! Plays just as well with some extra gravity features.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|The story is new, but it has the flavor of an old legend.  Scottish style.  The vocal accents are authentic and actually add to the story.  Well drawn art in every respect.  So well done, in fact, you will think the character's hair is real!  No kidding.  Get it, watch it for yourself, and see if I'm right.
B00BJS7LHC|4.0|overall not bad. Good direction, fairly decent acting. Not the best movie i've seen, but does have some re-watch value.
B004G600A4|5.0|Firstly, no naked actors.  Secondly, it's based on an old fairy tale. Rapanzel, and her hairdo is the same but from there it goes wildly different.  It's fun to watch, the songs are well done, and the story fresh.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|Amazing direction and a very well told story of an Indian boy. The movie keeps you on the edge all the time. Please watch the movie it will take you on a journey.
B000J670ZI|5.0|All you need is to see the chemistry between Cary and Kat and you'll know tat this movie EARNED each award received.  Funny characters, sparkling script, and funny action.  This one is totally worth the time.  So grab your popcorn, drink, and enjoy!
030758836X|1.0|Dull, dull, dull...  where are all the clever twists and intrigue I heard about?  I thought the 'mystery' was very predictable, and even if it wasn't, I cared so little about the characters, they are so boring and unlikable, that I had no real interest in solving what happened to the 'Gone Girl'.  Finishing this book was a chore in tedium--have no idea what people see in it.  Would NOT recommend it to anyone.  Too many other great books out there.
B00797MB0O|3.0|What you see in the preview is what you get. Charlize performance as a troubled soul is very good. The supporting roles were well casted.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|The book is a good read. However, it is a little confusing as the author jumps around quite a bit.
B00B3MN65K|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Josh Groban, so I didn't hesitate to pick up &#34;All That Echoes&#34; when I saw it. I was blown away by the music. &#34;Brave&#34; and &#34;Falling Slowly&#34; are two of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard. And the rest of the album is equally amazing.
B000FA675C|5.0|It makes you think. This could very well be true. I had no idea this went on in the Catholic church.
B004IDYK0G|5.0|A friend introduced me to The Script through their first album, and I fell in love. When this one came up, I eagerly snatched it up. I found it to be even better than the first. It's actually become my favorite workout music (which means that I have to try to remember not to sing along with the songs).
0547564651|2.0|This book reminds me of the 90's when I would buy a music CD for $18 just because the cover was interesting, then after a few minutes on the stereo I realized I wasted some hard earned money.  I admit that I was in a rush when I purchased the book, I wanted an interesting book for the train and as a new parent this look like the perfect read. Also, I have been hearing so much about it in the NY Times etc.<br />First I will say as others have said, that the title is misleading. The title should read \\"How At Risk Children Might Succeed\\" or more accurately \\"Random Bits of Educational Studies That You Probably Already Know About\\". If you are a parent and reading this book to get some insight of how to raise a successful child, you will get little advise from this book unless you are reading this in the waiting room of a methadone clinic.<br />I am not particularly knowledgeable about the subject of childhood education or even that avid of reader. However, I seemed to have read about most of the studies already presented in the book. Maybe it has just has been reviewed so much already?<br />The soap opera writing style where there are 4 stories going on at the same time and the moment that you start to start to get into one, it moves to another drives me crazy. It is a prime example of how to how you can make money with some Malcolm Gladwell light science and good connections and the New York Times.<br />I gave the book 2 stars instead of 1 because the information in this book is important and everyone should know about it through one source or another, I just wish I didn't pay for it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My 5 yr old son and mom love this game. Its right up there with angry birds. It makes him think on how to get it all to match.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Honestly, just give it a try and you'll be hooked! Great cast and actors! It's written wonderfully and very exciting...keeps you on your toes!
B00ARA4SLU|5.0|I loved knowing more about Hitchcock--especially his relationship with his wife.  It was quite revealing and entertaining.  I would definitely worth buying and sharing.
B004LROUNG|4.0|This story is great for easy ready with an interesting legal plot.  Has a really good ending.  Another great Grisham book/
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app is not as good as the PC mine craft but it is pretty dang good you need to get it great app
B000YMM3CC|5.0|I would give this movie 10 stars if I could!...you will not be disappointed if you love a true romance...

B006BAEQB2|3.0|I usually really enjoy her books. This one was a bit of a bore and I had to forge ahead at times to get through it. The subject matter was as usual interesting. But I found it hard to like any character in the book. She has written much better books.
0345531965|4.0|\\"Lawyer novels\\" are a specialty it's sometimes hard to get a grip on. Scott Turow (one of my favorites), for instance, writes excellent, gripping stories about legal maneuvering and the technicalities of courtroom drama. Grisham, on the other hand, seems to write mostly human-focused melodrama with a legal flavor, which isn't the same thing.<br /><br />In this one, one of his best, the aging Troy Phelan, worth $11 billion, writes the latest in a long succession of wills and does it so ingeniously as to make it virtually unassailable in court by the three ex-wives and seven children he excludes. Instead, he leaves his whole estate to the now-middle-aged illegitimate daughter he hasn't seen in twenty years. And immediately after signing the document, he takes a dive from his penthouse balcony, leaving his personal lawyer and only semi-friend, Josh Stafford, to carry out his wishes. So where is Rachel Lane? She appears to be a Christian missionary in the jungle along the Brazilian-Bolivian border, and her signature is required, or else the three Phelan families (egregious losers, every damn one of them) will get everything after all. So Josh turns to Nate O'Riley, a genius at litigation who is now in rehab for the fourth time, but whom he nevertheless trusts, to go and find the reclusive heiress.<br /><br />The bulk of the story, then is about Nate's quest, both for Rachel and for himself, among the swamps and snakes and Indians who have no reason to trust white men. Alternate sections follow Josh's dealings with the excluded Phelans and their desperate attempt to overturn the will -- and the several dozen greedy lawyers they hire to help them do it. The only really high-powered \\"legal\\" scenes are Nate's depositions of the family, which very enjoyable.<br /><br />Personally, I could do without the religious trust-in-god theme by which Nate is miraculously saved, but it's otherwise a pretty enjoyable book.
B0091WL8TA|5.0|I love this movie because you see Elvis in his uneasy state as he waits to do his concert. The crowds go wild and you feel like you are there with him. Its a wonderful film and I miss him alot.
076532413X|4.0|Sawyer is Canada's biggest-deal science fiction author and much of his stuff isn't half bad, though his earlier books aren't overwritten the way much of his more recent work seems to be, especially the WWW trilogy. (He's an interminable \\"explainer.\\") This one isn't so much \\"science fiction\\" as fiction about science. Set in 2009, ten years in the future at the time of publication, it's mostly about Lloyd Simcoe, a middle-aged physicist at CERN, and Theo Procopides, his much younger associate, both of whom are hot on the trail of the Higgs boson. Get temperatures up high enough in the Large Hadron Collider and they should be able to observe it. Another member of the team is engineer Michiko Komura, who is also Lloyd's fianc&eacute;e, and there are several other supporting players. But when they hit the button in the control room in Geneva to start their big experiment, they -- and everyone else in the world -- passes out and experiences a two-minute vision of their own future life twenty-one years in the future.<br /><br />That's the set-up, and it's a good one, leading to all sorts of problems and questions. Lloyd seems to be with some woman other than Michiko. Theo has no vision and evidence he gathers from others makes it clear he's going to be murdered. Is the future immutable? What if someone who doesn't like the future they've seen commits suicide? Beyond that, is the vision experience replicatable? Sawyer does a generally good job with his characters and the speculative science is based on the real thing, but then he makes the mistake of offering too much in the way of technological prediction. I read this book when it first appeared and re-reading it now was something of an eyebrow-raiser. Floppy discs are, of course, long out of date, but computer files in 2009 are saved to \\"optical\\" devices rather than thumb drives or to \\"the cloud.\\" (In fact, the author far underestimated just how pervasive the Internet would become in a very short time.) Bookstores have moved from selling published hard-copy books to print-on-demand copies, with no thought of downloadable digital books.<br /><br />This is the problem with trying to predict for the near future. Of course, any of us trying today to make similar predictions for a decade hence would also, almost certainly, get much of it wrong.ved from selling published hard-copy books to print-on-demand copies, with no thought of downloadable digital books.<br /><br />This is the problem with trying to predict for the near future.

B00BQPEIT2|5.0|I really like this game because I loved the movie. It has new things in it like balloon rides and going through magic tunnels to different worlds
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The Fault in Our Stars is faultless, flawless. Yes, it will make you cry, but you'll not regret a single tear.
B00992CF6W|5.0|BEST APP EVER. I really think they should update it to like the computer version. Like right now it's great but it's just not the same as the computer version go from version<br /><br />6.1 to 7.2 in seven point too it will be a lot more epic.
B005K17RU0|3.0|They have just updated this app and have taken it from an interesting looking app and made it kinda blah.  It offers all standard information as other apps but now it's in a washed out Microsoft Metro style.  Maybe there is something interesting looking in the store.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|The book renewed my faith in God.  A believable NDE experience coming from a very credible person in the scientific field.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|What's the best way to watch your enemies? Keep them close.  How do you ensure that your friends don't suddenly become your enemies? Keep them closer.  Of course, if you marry into a family that has grander ambitions and kinky pastimes, and then order your friend who helped you secure the throne to come to the capital to watch your back, no one should be surprised that hijinks are afoot and the peasants just want to try and stay out of the way so they can live to see another day.<br /><br />Nice story telling with fantastic cinematography give this series a grand feel.  Of course, you have to like the fantasy/magic and medieval type genres - otherwise you're likely to hate this series and I'd recommend you steer clear.  But if that is the type of thing you like, then you'll really like this series.

0446691437|5.0|He writes simple narratives that really hit home.  Sensible, smart, a book to read and re-read.  One of my top ten books, of all time.  Very helpful.
B0044RUSZM|5.0|Chose this rating becase it is attractive, is just the right height and makes easily  additional access desk space under it.It is also at tthe right height so that my second, permanent screen right next to it can be used simultaneous to drag things back and forth or keep my web access open at the same time as my email.  I also now don't get a stiff neck when leaning down to see the laptop when it is sitting on my desk. I would recommend it to anyone/everyone who is looking for a convent/comfortable place to put their laptop while at home.
