B00HWYFYVC|4|Comfortable an keeps your feet warm
B00C69DJPG|5|This scarf is beautiful and adds refined sparkle to my plain outfits.
B0009GE37G|5|Fits perfectly and my husband loves it.
B00DAH0834|5|Great Buy!
B00CXOP48O|5|when my son was fussing, i found that this outfit was easy to slide on and off. it kept him warm as well.
B001OCPTG8|4|Fits as expected and is pretty much invisible with low cut dresses and tops. Straps are convertible, which is nice. It has pockets for additional padding which is also useful
B00JM8MWTI|5|Very nice socks. As I stated much better quality than 'multi - pack' socks however nothing like Balegra or Injinji. If you want nice quality, thin socks these are it. But as I've experienced in the past do not expect longevity. While they are comfortable they will degrade within ten (10) months.
B00DNVIO4M|5|love it
B00K0VQ1YI|2|I should have known better than to order a slipper that was suppose to fit a size 7.5-9.  It's too big for my size 7.5 foot.  They are very soft so that is why I gave them 2 stars.
B00HX00BA4|4|It falls a little loosely, but not in an unflattering way. It is a nice color, very vibrant, and of a breezy summer fabric. The arm holes are a bit baggy, but that doesn't show if you're wearing a shrug, and the seam work along the inside isn't superior, but for the price it was what I expected, and I really like it. It is pleasantly distinctive, and I got great reviews while wearing it!
B00HSCAGBG|5|Love the shirt!  Great quality and fits as expected.  Made a great anniversary gift.
B00L9M3884|4|A little small, I ordered a 36C but being padded I should have ordered larger. However, they are very cute and cannot complain for the price as it includes matching panties. Hubby is very pleased!
B00JRN4BII|5|I can't even begin to say how much I love my Darth Vadar scrub top! I love the design and get many comments on it. Plus it is extremely comfortable! The stretchy sides are great. I wasn't sure I was going to like the one big pocket, but I really do. I keep looking for more scrubs made just like this one and with not just any ordinary designs! Thank you!
B00FOJ5Z6G|1|The dress doesn't go with the size, too small. Will not buy dresses again from senfloco.
B009IUE324|4|I would have rated it 5 stars if they came in other colors, the pocket is quite good if you have a habit of losing keys.
B00151UWQK|4|Well, what can I say, it's a cap with embroidery that says VO. Since VO is one of the things I do, i thought having one would be nice. Though a little pricey for quality, what i saw is what i got. I can say I am satisfied. If you're into VO you will know it is nice to have one of these... some times gets people curious and things get interesting. I do recommend.    Oh, and it says \\"As Heard on TV\\" on the backside.
B006FDFJDO|5|I wanted a book bag that was stylish and well, cool. I came across this one and knew it'd match pretty much everything I wore so I ordered it. I carry a huge book (2.5 inches thick and weighs about 10 pounds) along with a 1.5 inch binder and some odd and end smaller items. Those items fit perfectly and it has room for plenty more (at least 2-3 more books). It seems to be very sturdy as well. It is holding up well and hasn't started to wear and tear. For the price, I am very pleased and would have even paid double for this bag. You won't be disappointed.
B00FFXKEJO|1|I ordered a size medium, but it feels like a small. It's extremely short (unlike in the picture), and is very tight (also unlike the picture).
B00M3ZJVNM|5|My daughter loves these panties.  So Soft -- Her new favorite type!
B004M6XUI2|5|Very well made multi fold wallet. Very well stitched together. Not cheap at all. I'm very happy with my purchase. Lots of room for pics, credit cards or whatever.
B00I0V6CP8|5|WOW this jumpsuit is super flattering!!! True to size (I'm 5'5&#34;/135, regularly wear a Medium so ordered this in Medium), the material is good and stretchy, the pant length was perfect, the back part dips down your hips jaw-droppingly. My only gripe is that it doesn't cover my boobs at all; I'll have to wear a decorative bra or top with this (I'm a 34d). This red color makes me feel like a superhero though, so I'd have to be in the right/fierce mood to wear it. I'm getting the black one next ;)
B00CL0VRYA|2|it fit weird, kind of tight but long and shiny.
B00DSLNU3C|2|The material used for this shirt is so thin and threadbare that you can see through both layers without even holding up to the light.  If it fares well in the wash, we will keep the shirt because the colors are nice, it is decently constructed and it cost so little that it is not worth the effort in returning.
B0098L9QH0|5|My grandson loves this supeman tee shirt so much he won't take it off. I bought two so he can wear one and we can wash one!
B00EVPPG7M|5|It does hug every curve so if you are not in perfect shape it will show every lump. I wear it with a good slip and it is gorgeous.
B00MWOETN6|5|Bought a package of these to test them out, I am a size 10 and got the 10-12 size socks.  Upon arrival, they were JUST barely small enough to fit on my foot, and I thought that the 8-10 size socks would be better for me.  After a wash, however, the socks now fit perfectly as I'd like them.  So keep in mind they do shrink a bit so if you're borderline go with bigger.  They are great socks, comfortable, don't fall off, and have so far stood up to washing 1-2x.
B00L3Q9D8U|5|She loves it!!!
B00FQ8Z8H6|3|This item is a lot shorter than expected, It's still cute, and can't really complain for the price, but its not a great fit.
B00PG9DNGS|5|Perfect.  Quality exceptional....
B007699BEO|3|Great mask, but the tentacles make it a bit difficult to breathe.
B00PLKRKOS|5|This Dress is Great!!  Excellent Quality & Fit.  So Glad I Purchased It :-D
B00LUZ7CBO|5|These actually fit well in terms of stretch and comfort. They are however a little on the short side despite being listed as having a 'long inseam'. I read the fine print in the description so I knew before I ordered they have a 32&#34; inseam. I don't classify that as long but I'm 5'11&#34; so take that into consideration. I don't mind pants a little short these days because I can always wear tall boots over them or wear them as if they're cropped ;) Overall, these pants are nice and fit true to size--I just wouldn't call them &#34;long&#34;.
B001DGHP5S|4|It's a good looking tie but the thread down the center was kinda loose, but it's not big deal. Does the job.
B0088UPYDC|3|Runs small, the pants were too tight around his waist for him to ever wear, and the shirt ended up shrinking some....Didn't get much wear out of it, really
B005GNNZLW|5|I love, love, love, love this bra! I wear a 34 G and it is absolutely difficult to find bras at a reasonable price that are supportive. This bra offers both! The for is good and its cute. I will be purchasing more of these bras in different colors on the near future
B00H8B918Q|5|LOVE IT!!
B00GBT8QM8|5|Insanely cute and I think it will be just the right amount of warm for me.  I live in Minnesota and grew up in an even colder area, so cold doesn't bother me as much; this is a fairly open knit so probably not good for blizzards but ok for more mild days.
B00M78XIDY|5|Excellent
B008QL0DO8|4|Nicely made- and it seems like they will hold up well to lots of use, which is what they shall get.
B00OH1ZT1I|3|I would describe these pants as &#34;meh&#34;... The elastic bands are actually see-through instead of white stripes like I thought they were going to be. They're pants, they comfortable, they fit, and they cover my bottom so I would say that they do the job!
B006Y2NG4A|5|I like to wear socks that match the brand of sneakers I'm wearing. These are light weight, stylish and colorful. The original price offering on Amazon for six pairs was $32.00. I caught them on Amazon at the reduced price of $16.99, which was a very temporary price reduction. I'm so glad I waited. Polo anyone? Good luck!
B00OXGBTTI|4|I have a purple one and I LOVE it.  Then I ordered 2 for my Co-worker.  The black/white and the one that looks YELLOW in the picture.  Never even noticed the description says orange until it came and was ORANGE.  Then I saw the color description on the invoice with my order.  Orange. The picture needs to be changed.  They are letting me return it, but I wanted to warn others that the YELLOW is NOT yellow its ORANGE.  Here is a picture of what you will get if you order the one that looks yellow.
B004M6XUI2|5|It's what I like to see!
B006H5DJA0|5|these are the best choice if working long days in boots.  no toe seam rubbing at all, nice compression over the arch, ankle and calf.  if you have a wider than average calf the top compression may get a little pinchy by the end of the day.  these are my go to socks for working long days in the barn.
B0029JHSAU|4|Ordered these for my Mom, who is very picky about fabrics. She loves them. Fabric nicer than expected at this price point. Ordering more.
B00DGEJSBE|5|I love the skirt! I didn't know that the top part was separate, or that it had some funny mistranslated phrases on it, but I find that makes the skirt better. It suits me perfect, and I recommend you buy it if you want to feel adorable.
B00HNMJL0I|5|Nice dress. Fits well and great qualtiy
B00D5PVUE2|4|They are as good as I expected them to be.<br />Will buy more when i need too.<br />Anyone who wants to feel sexy should purchase them.
B00IPKPC4G|5|grt
B00R92MHIK|5|Nice..
B008IYCHAG|1|the two shirts i ordered had very crooked seams. the side seems were hitting in the middle of my stomach and running down the middle of my back on both shirts. too bad because the price and length are good and i like the dickies logo tag. they run very small as well.
B00BD5GH4O|5|This is a nice, light hat for the warmer months. Size adjustments are easy to make.
B0039824SQ|2|I got the 3-12 mo size for my 7 month old, and they didn't even come close to fitting him.
B00NJ873Q4|4|I ordered this top with the matching culottes skirtAnd I really love the look!I ordered a medium and they fit perfectly I wear a medium Or a largeThe fabric is light weight And really comfortableI haven't watched it yet but will take Other reviewers advice and hand wash and hang dry.This top is really flattering and actually covers the bowl just instead of accentuating themI'm going to order more In other colors.Best of all These pieces were made in the US of A!
B007AK1LW4|5|I purchased this as a gift for my sister for her birthday. They were a huge hit they do run small so if you have bigger legs may not fit
B008KCK3TI|5|Beautiful jacket.  Heavy.  Ideal for very cold weather.
B004JKE6JS|2|I don't know what I was thinking when I purchased this - it's definitely not my usual thing.  There's no real description of the fabric on the site - it just says \\"cotton\\".  From the photos (or maybe it was just wishful thinking), I thought this would be a light, drapey kind of cotton.  A casual outfit to throw on with a pair of sandals.  It started out badly when I opened the box, and it was a very thick cotton - it made me think of safari clothing.  And it was extremely wrinkled right out of the box - the kind of wrinkles that you can iron out, but will come back immediately.  I compounded the agony by actually trying it on - not a pretty sight.  It was skin-tight everywhere.<br /><br />I'm giving this two stars because there must be someone out there to whom this will appeal.  Like someone who reminisces about J Lo in her Jenny from the Block Days.  Everyone else, stay away.
B005AA5W8A|5|This is a GREAT Hat!
B0006NWDZG|1|i ordered a large swimsuit and guess what? they sent an XS swimsuit. there is no way i will fit into this. 1 star. wouldve been 0 if possible
B001FOR4YU|5|tremendous article, do not hesitate to buy it! I just love! will adapt to all my necesdades, time between very fast and safe, recommended 100% I am very satisfied with the transaction
B00GUB98QA|5|I really like HEAD gear and clothing. Their clothes always fit well and and feel comfortable. The convenience of buying them from Amazon.com can not be matched either.
B00M9P0TQO|4|It's a tighter fit than i expected but its still pretty great.
B00IMOAMFE|5|Luv!
B00CLK2FG4|5|beautiful,well made,and the quality is excellent.
B00GN72YVC|5|After 3 weeks of waiting, my order arrived though ive waited for so long but its worthy because my daughter love it and planning to purchase from this store again.
B001DDJ4IC|2|This apron is a little small.  The biggest problem is that it has to be washed as delicate.  The binding around the edge of the apron is not preshrunk so that even washing in cold can result in the binding shrinking more than the fabric of the apron itself.  This is a pricy item and you should be able to expect more.
B00N1U4X54|1|Was horrible. Cheaply made. Fits a child!
B00F2V7EDS|4|Does not fit as expected
B0036G9S7G|5|Love the Dickies Brand.  Reinforced knees great for boys!
B00OU8O7KW|5|Ordered for a friend and loved it!
B001415A2M|5|I bought this coat for my husband who is in culinary school.  The school he is going to doesn't have the best heating and cooling system in the kitchen area so this coat was perfect.  He absolutely loves it!!!
B00G23IC1S|2|unfortunately did not fit but super cute otherwise..
B00LHJH2QS|5|well made and the waistband is adjustable, not to mention cute in the extreme.
B00TYZA7LY|4|Liked this
B00HK50EQI|3|They're super tight.
B001H1TEXK|5|Beautiful wings that work for men or women
B00K2IJOHU|5|nice
B001GNILKQ|5|I'm planning to go on a cruise and when I saw this shawl I knew it would work with all my \\"smart Casual\\" dinner outfits. It is beautiful, much nicer than I had hoped. The material is soft and smooth and an added benefit of the weave is that I can choose to use the lighter side out one time and then for a different look I can reverse the shawl and wear the darker side out. It is light weight and will not take up a lot of space in my bag/ purse. Thank you for such a beautiful product and your quick shipping.
B005GYL9C8|4|This bag is nice.  I like the two seperate compartments so I know exactly where my eye makeup is (top) and facial makeup is (bottom)~the only problem that I found was that is collapses’ into itself~so I solved that problem by lining around the inside of the bottom compartment with cardboard squares cut to fit each side.  Works wonderfully.
B00C11AQLE|5|I bought these shorts for sleeping. They come looking very small, however; they stretch. These cover my whole behind, do not roll on legs. Breathable.  In this style, I did not have any color bleeding when I washed them. They are great for wearing under skirts as well.
B00CO6UZ44|5|These are so comfortable and surprisingly flattering on a 8 month baby bump. I'm very pleased with their quality. I look forward to having them in the hospital after baby's delivery.
B00C6FH7BM|1|returning for refund
B00AM2REVO|5|My wife has a big bottom,  5'2,  180 pounds,,  she has bought others that wont fit her butt but these fit her fine and looked great.
B00EB4B88Y|5|I'm plus size and never thought maxi skirts would look good on me....boy was I wrong!<br />I bought one at target and loved it so much I went searching for more.  I ordered this one in an xl (i'm 5'7 and a size 16/18) the length ls great (almost too long, but thats what the fold over waist is for!) I'll probably need at least 3 more, and I can almost order a L since it was almost too big and I'm currently losing weight.
B007ZTOFEQ|4|The suit is very nice And fits well. Very Funny when worn by the baby. Of course, it is polyesther not cotton but you know that
B00D7UX1YM|4|Seems to be fine.  Would order again.
B00KT914Y8|5|Hipster teen son loved it.  Has a quilted interior and interior pocket.  Also 'leather' detail at the exterior pockets.  Picks up cat hair easily.
B003ITAFMS|4|Nor real issues with this there was just some stitching on both ends that wasn't closed off that will allow small parts to slip out.
B0067FKCYG|5|Finally a wallet that holds the plethora of cards I have to carry.  ID, membership cards, credit/debit, company travel cards, etc.  I can carry them all and I like the security the zipper provides.
B00LAYEHUY|5|Shorts are great!
B00JAB0R3A|5|Very cute and in perfect shape. Packaging was perfect. I love it!
B00FMO4U1Y|5|This was a gift for my husband and he LOVED them. After seven years of him wearing nothing but Levis it's certainly a nice change to have him in designer jeans. Very happy wife!!
B0031ER6MW|5|I love all things Michael Jackson; King of Pop, King of the Dance Floor, King of Dads.<br />Thanks for sending the t-shirt!
B00NWKEM90|1|So sorry to see Hanes t-shirts quality go down, wherever these were made. Some arms are short some longer. Neck line is all stretched and sewn wrong. Just don't bother with these..seriously you'll be disappointed.
B00J5A7A40|4|very comfortable, light, fits well and kool looking!  the price was awesome too; highly recommend!
B003IBI0PK|5|Baby looks so cute. Great quality. Everyone loved it. The head part was s little tight
B00MVABOHA|5|I love this bag, used it for my hair supplies, on our last Harley trip, would recommend, and super fast shipment
B00FDW5EEW|5|Unique and not all pregnant women would wear this tee, but my daughter loved it..She is going to wear it at her baby shower.
B00ACIFVYU|5|I love these shirts.  Size L fits perfectly despite normally needing to go XL in most 100% cotton shirts, but as posted in many other reviews - these shirts run a bit large.  I'm 6-0, 180, athletic build.  The L is slightly big initially, but after a few washes they fit perfectly.
B00846FHP0|1|Bought these at a good price which was a mistake. Washed all 6 pr elastic had no stretch like they were washed a 100 times not 1. Will buy Hanes fron now on.
B00ISULUYY|5|just like in the picture, good quality , fits nice
B006TJXTE0|4|There was no Ralph Lauren logo on the right cargo pocket. The shorts are nice and comfortable, but you have no way of knowing that they're RL until you look on the inside.
B007WTDEL4|5|Great product.
B00OJOHJKW|5|Purchased for my granddaughter who will be here in November.  Fast shipping and high quality.  This onesie is well made and my daughter loves it!  Thanks!
B00PBCUK7U|5|I bought this for my mom for Christmas! She loved it😊😊😊! She wears it all the time:)
B00HPTN9XE|5|Loved it! Super cute dress!
B00TUC8OP2|5|I followed what other reviewers said and ordered a size Large when I am usually a Medium. I've worn the top once and it's very cute. I think it is best suited for wearing over a sports bra. This top did not stretch like similarly cut tops did.
B00KB88JRC|4|Good to get away from white t-shirts. I don't like myson to wear white because he is messy and white takes too much effort to keep bright. I was so happy to find these other colors and I am considering buying another pack of them. They are long so they tuck into his pants and stay there while he is squatting down or bending over. He is 3 1/2 years old, tall slim build, and very active.
B00HWFC5OA|5|Cute shirt.  Fit as expected.  Happy with purchase.
B0091KEWWM|5|My daughter had to dress up as Pocahontas for a school presentation.  She is 14 and 120 pounds, and she found it fairly baggy.  But the quality is nice and it was one of the few native american costumes that was appropriate for her age (the others were too skimpy).
B00H2ZOPRK|5|This shirt is the dopest of dope. The bomb.com even.
B00O8NIJIA|5|Great perfect !!!
B004FGMYNG|5|I find that all of these rash guards run small.  Also, my boys are tall for their age.  My son is 9.5 but is definitely the size of many 11 year olds.  This size 12 fits him just right.  Not a lot of room to grow though.  But the sleeves are long enough to cover his entire arm, it's not so tight that it's hard to get on over his head and seems like good quality.  I would definitely recommend it, but please order one size larger than you think you need.  Eg. for an 8 year old, order the size 10, for a 10 year old, order the size 12, etc.
B00KBZP040|4|My dad really likes these shirts. They seem very sturdy. They do run a bit large. Overall, a nice t-shirt.
B00IGDOA22|2|The top was not what I expected and did not arrive on time. The shirt was also too big and I did not like the style.
B009EREJ98|5|nice sock for the money
B004YJSGWW|5|Opaque and comfortable!
B00L8WBEMW|4|The top needs a little more support but it fits and the bottoms fit really well. I love how high the bottoms come up! Vintage look for sure!
B0100N24U0|1|not tight at all, really weird, you can easily take out the pad because i hate pads but that will make it larger and even less supportive
B000G7BF2O|5|I have been putting on weight and outgrowing my T-shirts for a number of years and I was regularly buying larger and larger size shirts, from a 2XL to a 3 XL and ultimately a 4XL size regularly. This XXL Tall T-shirt is an ideal size, it comfortably fits my torso and body, and it is long enough to always cover the previously regularly exposed area that appeared around my waist that would expose my stomach to the embarrassment of both myself and my colleagues. This comfortable cotton shirt covers all the necessary areas allowing me to move about freely and comfortably without embarrassing anyone.
B00IM9Z6MI|5|It was quite a hit at the writing conference!
B00QC71CGG|5|nice i love it!
B008BGY114|5|The wrong hoodie was shipped to me, but the company sent me another at no charge. Its soft and thick also.
B0072IHTIO|5|very nice lab coat at a great price.i use it daily .i am between large and medium size..would buy again.
B00NL1E5I8|4|Missing belt
B000DZLGPU|5|This is the third one of these Tula-made hats I've bought.  I wear it every day working in a greenhouse in Florida and the extra broad brim does a great job of keeping the sun off my face, ears, and neck.  The hat is exceptionally well made - I've gotten about 18 months of daily wear from each of the first 2 hats and have just started using my 3rd hat.  If you want a solid, well-made hat, this is the one!
B0018QS5HU|2|We ordered these because it said &#34;Regular&#34; which are no longer available in department stores and we assumed &#34;straight&#34; was the leg cut.  However, the waist seems to come up straight from the hips, making the waist much too wide to stay up without a belt.
B00LA3JRNM|2|The leggings were incredibly shiny and the pattern looked blurry and out of focus. Furthermore, the photo is not of the leggings I received: the ones I received had seams on both the inner and outer leg, while the image does not show a seam on the outer log. This disrupts the pattern and takes away from the aesthetics. Also, I comfortably wear a junior's size 7/women's size 8, and after 20 minutes of wearing the leggings, a hole ripped in the crotch seam. Poor quality overall.
B005GVRBXM|2|When I received these pajamas, I ordered my usual size, and they were almost two sizes too big.  They had a chemical smell that didn't go away until I had washed them a couple times.  They also are very faded.  The photos don't accurately portray how faded these really are.  They don't look stylishly faded - it was a &#34;worn far too many times&#34; faded.  I should've sent them back as I really am not satisfied, but the return policy with the company is not the greatest, and I didn't find anything in their catalog I liked for exchange.  I have worn them only once, and put them  in the &#34;alter someday so they fit&#34; pile on my sewing table.  Not sure it's even worth the time and effort to alter them, though.
B00B2JIXH0|5|I have been looking for a pair of pants that fit my waist and were not baggy in the hips; these are perfect. I can breathe at the end of the day and they are very flattering.
B001HYY8Q0|5|I measured according to their directions and ordered the size indicated by the measurements even though it was 2 sizes larger (band width) than I usually order, but the width was still a little snug.  I am sure it will stretch some and be perfect.  Otherwise I love the bra.
B001D08S7S|5|Love it. I got a medium for my son who wears 30-32.  It has a drawstring so i knew it would fit perfectly.
B000UX38QA|4|The hood is great, but the inner elastic doesn't come down very far. It would be more efficient if it came down the forehead more. Also the snap comes right over your mouth..odd? Other than that, it fits well.
B00PCSU10Y|5|Exactly as described
B0010XX922|5|I always wanted to get me a prayer shawl thanks so much it is a beautiful Tallit thanks again
B00N1S0PYY|5|My 13 yr old daughter wanted these, she was so excited when they came in the mail, she sleeps in them all the time
B00EBGTVMW|5|Item came as described, shipping was fine. I would buy from seller again. Thank You
B002VLP37G|3|Not really warm.<br />I could feel wind blow through my fingers during my snowboarding trip.<br />not recommended if temperature goes under -5C (which is quite common in many snow resorts)
B00J4AWOI8|5|Oh my god. Stunning. Breathtakingly beautiful. Exactly like the picture. So excited to wear this for my wedding!! It's a fraction of the cost of the ones sold in bridal shops.
B004OI2MDC|5|Looks great
B009PHDOCU|5|My son does not eat any meat with the exception of bacon, so this is a perfect shirt for him.
B00K5QV6AC|3|I really liked the look of this, but the sparkles (actually faceted studs) fall off. I found two on the floor before I ever tried it on. I did wear it to a Rolling Stones concert, and got a lot of compliments, By the end of the night, about 12-15 studs were missing, which detracted from the design. The rest have been sticking. I should have hit the backside with an iron for a little bit to adhere the loose ones better when I first got it. My daughter got one too, and she only lost about 6-8 studs. Maybe I can find replacements at the craft store.
B00JPORMTE|5|This shirt is amazing, feels comfortable and looks awesome :) and like the seller said it will have that vinegar smell but after the one wash it went away, I would so get this shirt for someone who want this
B00D9EZYNM|5|Good
B00I4CJ296|5|These pants are both comfortable and stylish. They look great with heels, cute flats, or combat boots. The material is soft.
B00G1N6RX4|5|Fits as expected and described.  My daughter likes the feel of the material and enjoys wearing it to practice.  Good quality.
B000MX902E|5|I like these Bali bras.  I like cotton bras and they are seamless.  I like getting them from Amazon because it seems that the stores don't always have this side in stock or they sell out fast.
B008LWVRCY|4|When I first got them they were too big but after washing they shrank and now fit me just right as I'm a small guy and most pants are really loose on me. I do wish they came in a 29x34 though I could use a little extra length but over all I love them. Definitely recommend.
B00C5WMMUC|4|Beyond the &#34;one size smaller&#34; motto of the brand, the fact that I consistently need to downsize definitely makes me feel thin! I did need to do some self-alterations to the thigh area -- a bit of a sag/gap issue. LOVE the color. I'm 5'5&#34;, approx. 115lbs, and these are the perfect length and fit in the waist and hips. Calf area is more of a straight jean than jeggings, but meh. I can alter that part too if I decide to.
B00JVTA6N2|5|excellent
B00L4N88KG|5|Great jeans for a great price!! Highly recommend.
B0061YHKCK|4|the cover is very nice and I love the butterflies.  I only wish that the leather would be a little more soft.
B00A3ITSQG|3|Small
B00AWMC4MI|5|It is cool, breezy and beautiful. My daughter loves it. It should be sold in many other colors. A very good choice if one wants to avoid pink.
B00JHAUUPO|5|Beautiful classic style dress that I love! It is stunning on. Second dress from this brand and will be buying more.
B0029NDFHG|2|The Hello Kitty charm with crystals on the side is a disappointment.  The crystals aren't in place properly (half in the socket and sticking out and crooked), and will fall out at the slightest bump I'm sure - and it has scratches as well on parts of the silver.  Not nearly as cute as in the picture.  I also ordered the victory peace sign charm.  It looks very different in person!  1st of all, the background isn't pink at all as it looks in the picture...it's white.  I know the measurements are listed - pay close attention because it looks much much smaller in person.  Also, the silver coloring on the sides/back have noticeable flaws like scratching, denting, etc.  Definitely a disappointment.  I know it's an inexpensive item, but with the shipping cost doubling the price even though the shipping is no where near that much on this item, it makes the cost much more.   VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH LOOK OF THESE CHARMS & THE SHIPPING COST WHICH DOUBLES THE PRICE FOR ITEMS CLEARLY NOT WORTH THE MONEY :-(
B00H3A9LM8|5|Super cute.  Shipping was fast and price was right!
B00MEXLGX6|3|It's okay; not incredibly fancy, not incredibly shabby.  However, the small runs too small even for a 5'1&#34; , 110 petite woman...
B00CLT485Q|2|Fit was what I expected, but the t-shirt faded through the logo after the very first wash. Maybe the darker shirts don't have that problem...I am left somewhat disappointed.
B00CALVX4O|5|This was a great product. Somewhat wrinkled hen it arrived but easily fixed. Held together very well. I was impressed with the quality of the product. :)
B00LK0I8EO|4|These fit as expected and are fairly comfortable.
B00CBAOHR4|5|nice
B0043RRUDQ|2|My son is 16 month old and weighs 30 lbs. I ordered 5T cause I like him being comfortable and not squeezed into tight clothes. The arm opening is way too small to begin with and after only one time in the dryer the set will probably fit for only a few weeks. Good price , but you get what you pay for! I also ordered a more expensive set from this company... only available in a 4T and it was actually larger than the 5T. Feels and fits better too!!
B00L28787W|5|This is really warm  I had a north face artic  parka that did not keep me as warm as this jacket.
B00DYF17J6|5|Great socks, love the colors, get a ton of compliments
B005C9GNNW|3|Decent quality for the price you pay. Size is good. Although, I'd love to get the colours according to picture I saw on Amazon for my husband. I understand the order description was 'colours may vary'.
B00NCSQRAO|1|Don't buy!! Won't fit...you boobs will fall out the bottom, and it has NO support!
B00ODFCAYM|5|This shirt is awesome and it fits great. I bought this shirt for someone who normally buys 2XL in Women's but an X Lin Men's worked great. There was was plenty of space and it looked amazing. Fabric is cool and soft.
B00L45XVXS|5|I've only worn/washed this sweater once so far, but it is cute, fits as you would expect, and it held up perfectly from the one wash. It's not something that I will wear often, so it works for what I needed.
B00JXOF9VE|5|Recipient loved them! Good quality.
B008BHSB32|3|I needed a black blazer that was professional, but also stylish. This seemed perfect!<br /><br />When I first got the item, I didn't think it was too bad. It didn't look much like the picture and was quite big, but it was manageable. I ordered a small and think the only reason I could pull it off is because I have a curvy figure. The issues arose after just one wear. The decorative buttons are not sewn on well at all. Not only did they fall off, several of them actually broke, so there is no hope of reattaching them.<br /><br />The jacket is priced cheap, so I wasn't expecting too much. I think I got what I paid for. I'm going to buy some new buttons for the jacket and get it taken in. I'm willing to put in a few extra bucks to taylor this jacket to my liking. I would not recommend this jacket to someone looking for a long-lasting, high-quality article of clothing.
B00FLVLFCK|1|Why???  You look like an @ss  wearing socks with flip flops or sandals. That's what old men and foreigners wear because they have no clue. If you think you look cool wearing this combo YOU DONT!  We are all laughing at you not with you.
B00EYQHJC8|5|Very good belt and buckle.
B00GIW89HU|4|Like this shirt very much, very satisfied.
B008YCXKN0|5|Excellent quality although the x-large runs small and I gave it as a gift. The shirt tends to be tight in the chest area. If you wear an x-large go for the xx-large.
B00MWWKQDU|4|Great coat!
B000ZHFGGQ|4|Kept slidding down my leg, a little bit smaller then expected
B008M60UI6|4|Buen producto, calidad esperada, buenas terminaciones, lindo diseño, la talla es en realidad entre 18 y 24 meses. La bata es exquisita, muy abrigadora. Lo recomiendo.
B009XHPKSI|5|Daugther LOVES it.
B007OSK7V8|5|Finally a pair of pants that you can prevent the &#34;gap&#34; in the back.  The first pair I got were too short and it was so easy to exchange at no charge.
B002KJ8GWS|4|This dress would have been a perfect fit were it not for the velcro strips in the back instead of a zipper. I had to have a zipper sewed into it before it actually fit like it should.
B004PORHWQ|5|I LOVE LOVE LOVE this bra.  The fabric is hard to describe but it's incredibly soft and sensuous feeling.  It's also wonderful to finally find a unlined bra that still offers shaping!!!  It has it all - my significant other thinks it's gorgeous!<br /><br />I'm a 38D and found it to still be VERY supportive as well as beautiful!<br /><br />Hope this helps folks.
B00UF7VUCK|5|I ordered two of these shirts in different colors, both are beautiful and fit great.  They fit nice and loose, light weight material so the hang naturally without being too tight across the chest or being to tight in the sleeves.  I love how long the front is so you are not tugging your shirt down all day.<br />I will definitely be order more colors!
B00NL0F5XI|1|The outfit is not true to size. I would order 2 sizes bigger for the tights to be worn in winter with boots. These were extremely too short and tight for my child,
B00BXQKYRO|3|Looked like an Obama shirt
B0007YXWAO|5|I have worn this bra for several years.  Last year has a left mastectomy.  This bra when corecctly fitted holds the prosthesis in place completely and is most comfortable.  Well wearing and comfortable fit.
B00K59NDT6|5|love my hat!!
B00CTJUOZG|3|Small fit, inexpensively made. Would recommend with those considerations.
B00P0C2WTA|4|Very comfortable material, fits as I expected! Very cute!
B00FRL3LVM|5|Bought for my daughter to wear for Halloween. Went  as a pretty little liar. Very nice coat. She will be wearing it once the weather gets cold.
B003O8B1IU|5|Although I am in college, i love having my Harry Potter backpack! its one of a kind! Other Harry Potter fans compliment my backpack and some people may make a &#34;huh&#34;face. but i absolutely am in love with it!
B00CEHR9IS|5|Love the design
B001D3NN16|5|These jeans are some of the softest I've ever had.  They fit great and I get plenty of compliments.
B007K4NLLE|5|My son loves this - he would have liked it to say Chrysler 300 but it is now one of his favorites.
B00BYP7ONG|1|Too small. A ripoff. The size is actually a 34x32. Some one tried to replace the tag with a 38x32 tag to fool customers.
B008VS8R1W|5|I LOVE THIS SHIRT ALOT
B00EFQFVYU|3|Loved the sweater but it didn't fit like I thought it would. It was definitely too small.
B00J6SK944|3|Very cute dress. Straps come unstitched so had to stitch them on better.. runs small wish i would have ordered a bigger size. But, overall i love the dress.
B00M8PYKNI|5|I love the fit of these pants.  They are really comfy, but they do stretch out by the end of the day.  Carhartt needs to add the inseam lengths to the webpage.  Inseam lengths are also missing from the size chart. They provide inseam lengths for men, but not women.  Men can pick their exact inseam length when ordering pants.  Women come in different heights just like men!  It is totally unfair that 1) Carhartt doesn't even give the inseam length on the webpage, and 2) women are not even given a choice of inseam lengths!  The Amazon webpages states it is a 21-inch inseam, and they roll up to 17-inches. Both statements are incorrect.  There are no snaps or ties to roll them up.  So, I went to the Carhartt website and chatted with an online salesperson and they said that the size 14 Lakota Pant has a 32-inch inseam. This is not correct. The 14 regular has a 31-inch inseam, which shrink to a 30.5-inch inseam after washing.  I do not put them in the drier.  They dry very quickly and they would be great travel pants.  Carhartt needs to provide better service to women!
B009Z7EVH2|3|Wish they had size options. One size fits all is a little large for me, normally I wear a small. Certain angles don't work well with the touch screen
B000J12JDG|4|the navy blue is darker- closer to a midnight blue
B00BEIY4S6|5|good quality, fits just right, fast ship
B00L51P1VG|5|This is a great top.  It looks great on, and is a nice material.  I am so glad they came out with more colors.  I have it in the tan, purple and just ordered the black.  When I first ordered it they only had tan and blue available.  It is a little long, but that is okay with me, I like some of my tops to be a little longer depending on what pants or skirt I am wearing.  I love patty clothes!
B00BN83RHQ|3|its beautiful but waaay too small And I got a large
B00EYV8ZIK|5|I love this hoodie! So cute!  I just wish I got it the day b4 for realms con &#60;:(!!! But I still love it and use it for Halloween!
B00HZF9YKU|3|I ordered this dress last minute for a wedding.  It arrived promptly but I was very disappointed to find that the dress was crammed into a plastic bag and completely wrinkled.  I can deal with wrinkles, but I can't deal with the deodorant and sweat stains that were all over the garment.  I understand that people try on dresses, but there needs to be some quality control prior to re-shipping.  So gross. I would give the dress itself 4 stars as it was a bit shorter than I was hoping and a smidge tight in the arm, but I can't get over the stains.
B00HUS75I0|3|Fruit of the Loom sizes do not correspond with clothing sizes and therefore are hard to understand.  The listing should include weather the number corresponds to small, medium, or large.  The quality of the panties is excellent, there just needs to be a better explanation of the sizes.
B0086L0MJO|2|was way to large especially in the arm holes....will be sending back and reorder for a large.
B00CMX53N2|5|The detail on this shirt is AMAZING!!!!!!
B009S6KR50|4|I had no problem with this belt as the other review states.  It was in perfect condition.  Of course its going to have an odor.  It's man made materials sealed in a plastic bag.  Once out of the bag it looses its plastic smell.  Great belt for the money.  What do you want for 5 bucks.come on!
B00CXSFD8G|5|Nice...really nice.  Great quality t-shirt and I love the image.  It will proudly be worn by<br />my husband &#34;Dom&#34; see the irony in the image?....supposed to mean FREEDOM but his name is Dom<br />and it looks like it says &#34;Free Dom&#34;.  I thought it was funny.
B00E4H7H42|2|It was cute but too small for me. I was looking for something more roomy. Too bad it doesn't come in an extra large.
B008TKIMOO|4|I love these pj's. They fit well and it's made from very nice material. I am happy I purchased them. They are true to size also. I brought them as I was going to the UK on vacation and coming from the Caribbean, I wanted to keep warm. However, it's more suited to a warmer climate. I love them still though. .
B00MGNJJD8|4|Like me, but too short.
B004LQ1684|5|Our son thinks hes a robot monster when needs this.  Its cute and the pattern on it is really cool for kids.
B00FO8CERA|5|Exactly what I was looking for.  A sock/bootie that my baby doesn't hate!  Comfortable and very cute! A must have
B00FDL422I|5|I wear hats because I have to not because I want to.  This Hat I Like!
B00JGWX3AC|4|It was just as I expected. It is warm and comfortable.  I have since ordering the coat gained some pounds and the jacket fits little snug but back on my regiment of exercise and food intake I should be back to ideal wait in no time.  The jacket is just what I expected and the cost was much less than what my company was asking for theirs.
B00NVRAR6G|5|It a truly ridiculous sweater and my boyfriend (who loves cats AND aliens) couldn't have been happier this xmas. Good quality, a tad itchy - but not more than you'd expect from heavy knit. A great gift for the weirdo in your family!
B00LEJGWXK|5|The pants are nearly sheer; that was unexpected.  Otherwise, they were as described.
B00N2O7UDG|5|Nice jacket
B00B8QP5AK|5|great
B00ARHJW8W|5|Excellent
B00PI5EO3G|2|I order two pair pants in the exact size 36 the other pair is a perfect fit but the union bay is way too large
B007TR14V6|4|nice but to order your size go to sizes up if wear size lg buy xxl will fit you perfectly
B00CBWJLHS|5|Seems warm and cozy. I am from California and it is summer now, so we have not got to try it out on a cold winter day. Our little boy loves it so at least he will want to wear it.
B00F2YSAAG|2|To small
B005PWRTNY|4|I ordered this suit to go away with. It is adorable! Not much to it so if you are looking for a suit with a bit more coverage....this would not be for you.
B0002UD2ZS|5|I found these online last school year and continue to order them because of the quality and fit. The price is so reasonable for such a product. They also iron easily and hold up well.
B004SW9N9K|4|Reordered a extra small. Will be getting it next week. Hope they fit better. Been looking for overall for years..
B00E1LACKW|4|Love this dress! The only issue was that it was kinda big. I usually get an XL cause of my bust, but the elastic doesn't even stretch when I wear it. But i still love it!! Well made. The sleeves flare beautifully, and when you lift your arms, no need for a tank top, it's covered inside the dress. Happy with this purchase!  Every woman should have one of these dresses. You can dress it up or lounge in it. :)
B00FR6NCDE|5|Good to go!
B00AMGM6Y0|1|Shirt just arrived. Very disappointed. Forty dollars for a tshirt, you would expect it to be awesome and perfect, right? WRONG! The graphic is crooked. Lame. And there are lines across the top, sides and bottom from the iron on transfer.  WTF, Care Press and Amazon?!? I know its Christmas, but how about a little quality control? I guess I'm giving a jacked up gift. Boo
B00B30SFPI|5|First of all, the quality and softness of the fabric is unbeatable. I can't believe this cost only $25! The interior is ultra plush, very comfortable. I got two, one in red and one in kayak.<br />The kayak is like a turquoise/teal, awesome color.<br />I highly recommend this hoodie!<br /><br />If you like your clothes a little more loose, then go a size up. The sleeves are a little tight.
B000YZ3QWK|5|Easy to attach and almost invisible under the tie. Unlike other collar extenders which have elastic bands, these are sturdy and do not come off the buttons (easily or not at all) during the day.
B0083LQUGG|5|Really good product, with high quality. I feel tickling with most tights on but this yoga pant does not give that bad feeling
B00GPPPB4Y|5|I absolutely love this swimsuit, although I can understand why it might be too low cut for someone taller.  I'm 5' 3&#34; and it is a perfect fit on me.  Very flattering, with good support.  I only wish Anne Cole would bring this style back.
B00LLIVQJY|1|It pokes out  a lot making it very visible
B00FF5ZSF2|5|purchased for my wife as an xmas gift and she absolutely loves it, she looks great in it as well, seems to be very well made, just a great looking coat. one thing tho, it was packaged horribly, rolled up and stuffed in plastic wrapping, really couldn't believe it. i also purchased and received a pair of flannel pajamas for my wife at the same time from amazon, which cost a fraction of what the coat cost, and they came packaged in a very elegant box, and within the box they were very nicely folded and covered with elegant tissue. still can't believe the coat arrived packaged to horribly, as if it were a returned and resold item.
B00DHCA1VG|5|Absolutely love League of Legends. Was a little bigger than i expected but it is definately worth it. Ganna hang it on my backpack and several people have already said they are jealous. 5 stars
B0053WPSEI|5|Love this swimsuit bottom! It's very cute and comfortable as well.  The fabric held up well too, I plan to wear it again next summer.
B00LNF1YRO|5|Got it for my 14 yr old and she loves it. Everytime she wears it, &#34;readers&#34; compliment her on this shirt and start a conversation. It is awesome to hear them speak about something they love.
B00MHDY6GC|2|Cheap material
B00K73KQ36|5|Love these! They're so comfortable.. I wear them at home as well as out.. it can instantly polish an otherwise plain outfit.. great as a light throw for cool summer evenings or as a throw on over casuals for quick errands.. in pic I have it on over leggings and a tank..
B00C57A8CQ|5|Great fit will surely buy more
B00LTX7XXY|1|SMALLER THAN ADVERTISED.
B00HO05YKU|1|These are s***ty socks.  The diamonds in the argyle pattern are stitched together, after one washing the stitching unravels and the sock falls apart.
B009YN3Q8C|5|I got these footed jammies for my sons 3rd birthday.  they are super soft and he loves being able to dress up as woody before bedtime.
B002W2IB2I|5|I was worried because there was not a size specified, but this hat fits my smallish head perfectly!  Great for my Red Hatters lunches, as I don't care for the bigger, more flamboyant types of hats some wear.
B00COFIP4C|4|Very cool wash, like other posters have said they almost pass for jeans. They are initially tight but are perfect after one wear. I'm 5'10'' 160 and got the large and they are long on me, easily rolled up. I plan on getting a couple of other colors as well. Great yoga pants, worth the price. Far superior to Target's yoga pant.
B00L10YZ0E|3|They were shorter than expected, but the fit was good. I normally wear G.V. jeans and they fit me about perfect, but I usually wear a size 6. In the Lee's I need an 8. I wanted a slim jean that I can wear with flats and the regular size is too long. I'm about 5'3&#34; with normal length legs. 28+ inseam.
B00L4RZ0O4|5|love it
B000VPG3E6|2|this costume's worth MAYBE 20 bucks,  we ended up paying double that on Amazon.  the first time my son wore it the armpits tore out of it as well.  i know its not built for everyday wear but then dont' charge more than  good pair of jeans
B00NHN9UIK|5|Good quality, accurate description of merchandize
B00KU5C2BK|3|I purchased size 5 for my daughter soon to turn 5. Quite tight at the top so size 6 would have been better.<br />Apart from the size, a gorgeous dress.
B00JE8G89G|5|I wear a size 12, but knew these ran small....and as I am busty , added 1 size up....to XXL.....fits perfect. I was receiving complements all day!
B00C20DSEQ|4|a little too small but looks great if you have nice legs.
B00ABYU122|5|Love it cause it's retro and still cool
B005902428|5|nice looking and appears durable. Good price.
B007CCVYRC|5|I live in Hawaii. So why am I writing a review on such a heavy jacket?! Well my wife and I planned a trip to New York in the winter. I've been in cold weather before, I've got snowboarding a couple times and have the snowboarding jackets and what not. But it was never during a really cold season. It was often 30 degrees F.<br /><br />During our trip to New York, however, it was much colder. With the wind chill of 0 degrees F, it was cold. Like, really cold. And for someone from Hawaii, it was REALLY COLD! Of course, I layered underneath, but this jacket did a really good job of keeping the warmth in and the wind out. I was very satisfied with it.<br /><br />Of course my face was still cold and my hands were frozen every time I had to take my gloves off, but that's not the jacket's fault.<br /><br />Overall, it is a wonderful jacket. Very well made.
B00J9A9R5Q|5|Love them!
B00ISRCM4E|5|Great
B00FW4DJCK|4|The fit are like a Yoga pant, very comfortable....I was expecting them to be a little heavier, but I am very happy with them
B00NX769RA|5|I have had a hard time finding footed PJs for my 10 year old grandson, who is tall for his age & wears size 12 pants. I wasn't sure that these would fit, given that they were a 10/12. But they fit perfectly for him! They are very well made & look like they will last awhile - or at least until he outgrows them. The material is extremely soft & the fit is comfy. He wears them for lounging around the house, & has even worn them outdoors. They are so warm that he only wants a sheet or very light blanket, even when the house temperature is in the mid 60's. I highly recommend these!
B00I1D6YHQ|5|Nice!
B004SQUL9C|1|I purchased this bolero to wear with a cocktail dress for a Christmas dinner.  I expedited the shipping so that I would get it in time, which I did, but was very disappointed with the product I received.  The material is very flimsy and clingy, which when you add the large ruffles on the front and sides weighs down the jacket considerably. The jacket lacks any body or shape.  I am a size 20/22 and per the sizing chart I ordered a 2x to be on the safe side.  When I put the jacket on it didn't even come close to laying like it does in the picture.  The ruffles were directly underneath of my armpits.  I could pull the jacket to cover up my bust, however because of the material it didn't stay there - it just went right back under my arms.  I'll be returning it and rush ordered a different jacket from David's Bridal.
B00IWETRVO|5|My husband is very happy with these. He is always on his feet and the softness on the bottom of the sock is key for him.
B0002TORDA|5|These are fine quality socks that will stay perfect many times longer than other brands. Nice, thin, absorbent, not 100% cotton like the originals, but nice stretch and actually feel like all-cotton socks.  Comfy on the ankles and adjustable up or down. I have pairs of these that have lasted over 15 years.  It is hard to find this \\"anklet\\" (adjustable cuff) style that is so versatile. Be careful of reviews that say they are not like the old ones or aren't warm enough.  Gold Toe makes MANY different styles, and even more than one style of \\"anklet\\".  Some of their anklets are quite a bit thicker (I have them, also).  Some buyers may have bought these without researching all that were available.
B00FCDF47O|5|Cool hat!!!
B00SSTM7CY|5|Had bought the purple ones before. Bought red and black cause I liked them so much
B00A8E8GMM|5|I bought this dress for my son's wedding.  I loved the way it fits, and on that day it was 103 degrees, but I still stayed cool.
B00BKBPP3A|3|Somewhat small but it will do.
B00LMKEFD0|5|Nice socks
B0050INNCE|5|My husband adores these socks, They are on his wish list for birthdays, Christmases, and for no occasion at all.
B00BLMRHL6|4|Just a bit snug for a plump guy like me.  But it is a simple outfit with likeable results.
B007N11GNY|2|The shirt smells like burnt rubber. I don't know if the smell would ever go away, so I will have to return it.
B010P6J9OQ|5|Great shirt to go tiwh the Children's Toddler Golf Set
B008ORO55M|5|Great shirt. Was a gift and he loves it. Looks just like the picture.
B005JD3V1S|5|Great socks!  Stretchy and easy to put on!  My 5 year old needed help putting on other socks but not these.  Highly recommended.
B004OWHIIM|5|For the price, this is the best plain t you can get. It fits nice and snug, and doesn't have bat wing sleeves (you know, the giant t-shirt sleeves that look like floppy bat wings). It is durable and didn't even shrink when my husband accidentally dried it on high.
B000BB85LE|5|I have this upright in green.. along with the 17\\" tote bag.    I love this luggage.  it has compartments for everything, plus a little drawstring bag which is handy for keeping your dirty clothes separtate from the clean on your return trip.      it is well crafted and the material is easy to clean.    i went with green because it stands out at baggage claim.  i've gotten tons of compliments.
B004B8C2CQ|5|This product is AWESOME! Bought one for me and my son and I'm definitely going to buy more in other colors!
B0105D0EAW|4|I'm 5' 5', full-figured (18W) and busty (36G) so I ordered the XX-Large. The print is very pretty and vibrant and it technically fit as expected; however, in person the top is a little clingy across my chest, belly and bottom in a way I'm not personally comfortable with and the length is slightly long for my full shape. Someone who doesn't mind fabric that's slightly clingy and/or someone who's a little taller and would wear this with leggings will probably be very happy with it. The probably is more with the way I'm built than with the shirt. I wish it had fit my shape better because the colors and the style are very pretty.
B00G56OMAM|5|Great material. Soft, stretchy, and comfortable.  Tunic is a great length.  The neck opening is a bit deep, but it's fine with a tank top underneath.  The sleeves are a great length as well. Overall a great product.
B00GFIV2DK|5|Great swim shirt with plenty of room to grow. The size 5 fits just like his size 5 t-shirts, nice and loose, rather than pulled tight like a lot of swim shirts. Seems to be comfy for him. I always have my son wear these, that way I don't have to put so much sunscreen on him!
B00OBEON5E|1|Poor cheap China clothing
B004NSCK9E|3|I bought these to wear under white jeggings to cover some cellulite & panty lines. Although it does that, at the thighs where<br />the control top ends and the more sheer part begins it is tighter there so you can see that thru your pants and gives you a line and it looks like you are wearing mid-thigh spanks.
B004Y4WEO8|4|My son loves his Lego Batman and I really shopped around to find a good price but the selection was very limited so I went with these.<br /><br />They were kind of expensive for underwear but I'm realizing that most character underwear is up there in price.<br /><br />The underwear seem to be of good quality and after several wearings and washings I didn't notice any fading or shrinking so they pretty much stay the same size as when purchased.
B002KDKE3I|5|lovely design and nice quality flannel
B00K5AJV46|3|The company Lucky21 is great! As far as the manufacturers (Zenana Outfitters), it seems the quality of the tanks has gone down. I've worn this exact brand and type since about 2007. Some I still even have. Recently, I ordered a 4pk and I wore 1 a day for 4 days. Every single one, every single day, broke where the plastic bracket adjuster is. Every single one!! I can understand MAYBE one, but not every single one. I called Lucky21 and they immediately replaced all of them at no cost. They were really great. I just got them in the mail yesterday and wore my first one. I took it off and it's still all in tact. So far, so good. Maybe I just got a bad batch, I suppose, but this isn't the first time it's happened. They should really address the problem, I can't be the only one who's having this problem. AAA+++ for LUCKY 21 and Amazon for the transaction.  :)
B00KLTE1EG|4|:)
B003PV8K3A|5|Very good quality Hijab.  I wish I could find the very same one in navy blue.
B0033PRG56|5|After reading reviews, I almost didn't purchase... but, I'm so glad I did. Reviewers said it was too small, but I found that to not be true. It fits well, and I'd say I have an average sized head, maybe even larger than most women. It is so cute and I can't wait to take it to Hawaii!
B00GBT8QM8|5|Great
B000OV9A1K|4|i had to do reshape. generally i always do reshape except on rare occasion where the items fits well. but its very cool
B0046RPWW4|1|This costume sizing is way off. I purchased a men's medium for my son which is his normal size. The shirt fits perfectly but the pants are three sizes too small. They look more like they would fit a child medium instead of a men's. For the price I am VERY disappointed! Amazon was even kind enough to send a replacement in case the costume contained a mismarked pair of pants with it but definately not the case. The second pair was smaller than the first!!! Stay away from this product unless you are paying $70 for the shirt. The pants are going to be a throw away. :(
B007TRAEDA|4|How do u like ur bacon?...on the front of a t-shirt to tell the world.To bad the guy i got it for wont wear it.
B000KGOM9E|5|These are great stockings it is good to still find stockings that require a garter belt the quality appears to be rugged yet sheer and glossy to stand many uses and have that feminine look will be purchasing more in the near future
B000N8TK2I|3|The inseam is marked 30&#34; but measures 32&#34; and required alteration
B00I4DMVUW|5|I wanted a tunic length top that was colorful.  This fit the bill!  I did not notice from the pictures but the sleeves are actually &#34;exposed&#34; shoulders.  Not very exposed like some tops, just a hint when you move your arms, so still work appropriate.
B00HDMFL66|4|I bought the 3-4 months size, my baby is 10.5 lbs and its too big for her. i think it'll fit her when she's about 5-6 months old.<br />The outfit is really cute though.
B004L8J0C6|5|Excellent price on a great product. These stays seem to be great quality. Obviously they aren't hardened steel, and any piece of metal this size would bend relatively easily if subjected to intentional bending forces, but for use as collar stays I don't think they can be beaten.
B002SIGY6Q|5|Other than them being large in the feet (I wear size 7), I love these socks.  They are great to wear with jeggings or skinny jeans tucked into knee high boots. I also purchased the grey.  They are warm around my calves.  The foot part is a little thin so I wear thin footies to keep my feet warm, but that's ok because it seems shoe and boot manufacturers are making shoes much wider than they used to.  I wish they made these in every color!
B003XRSAV8|5|Perfect fit on me (Adult).  My son will love it for XMAS.
B00R2GBSVU|5|Fits her nicely
B00GG07CE0|5|Silm-FIt is comfortable for me.If your size of the classic is 3,your size of silm-fit is 4.
B007T5KCFW|5|I bought this suit because bacon XD. It's more than a novelty item to me though. The formal applications are endless. I paired this suit with a light red trilby and was the star of my sister's wedding. Women were obviously interested, as I saw them staring, but perhaps were too intimidated by my classy style to approach. When paired with a dark red porkpie I looked incredibly dapper for my Dad's funeral. The preist had some choice words, but I informed him that God was not real, and that my athiestic euphoria trumped all. Definitely recommend this suit for anyone looking for the confidence boost to become a true alpha male.
B00HWFCIVK|4|Product was as described. Fit was true to size chart. Very nice fit and feel.
B001H0KO12|5|Bright red color; as soon as it arrived, my daughter claimed it as her own.  Stretchy enough to fit all sizes.
B00D7HX8L6|5|The T is better quality than expected, the ink is average just as with any other T. I have bought T's that were thinner than this. If the ink on the silk screening was any thinner I would have been bummed. I will make sure to wash the T with other cotton items (NOT jeans) and make sure to turn it inside out, not to damage the print. All in all a good deal, but it is coming from Singapore. I ordered on March 12th, I signed for it on April 3rd, 5 days before it's earliest arrival date.<br /><br />Note: I HAD to sign for it, when delivered.
B008FCBP1S|3|These jeans were not what I was looking for, im sure they will be great for somebody. I dont like leggings and these jeans look like denim leggings. Just not for me.
B00LY0F2TO|5|Love them!!!
B007OTP1A4|5|These are sharp pants.  Comfortable, affordable and they look good at the office or out on the town.  They are virtually wrinkle-free which is an added plus.  The sizing is sometimes inconsistent.  I own 3 pair - all 32&#34; in the waist.  One pair is tight and the other two are just right.  I will definitely buy another pair of these.  The flat front looks a lot better than I thought.  I'll keep some of the pleats will always be in my line-up but these are a nice change.
B00BFW8RB6|5|I love this hat! I wear it often. Unfortunately, because I cover my hair for religious reasons, I can't use the clips, so I put the hat on a hairband. Because the hat is kind of large and bulky, the hairband (which is pretty good in itself) slip-slides around a teensy bit, and occasionally gets knocked off. That's more because of my own circumstances, so while it gets a little annoying, it's still good. I don't know how great it is with the clips, but I can say they're really stuck on there because it took forever to take off, and the hat is also nice and sturdy, (just mind the feathers, but that's to be expected with feathers, so no news there).
B0009W0B6M|5|I'll be getting married in about 3 weeks and I wanted everything possible to make my tummy appear smaller in my dress.  It not only makes my tummy and waist look smaller.  It also makes me look like I have a waist.  Like I have a little hour glass figure.  I wear it everyday under my clothes.  Cant wait to wear it on my big day.
B002QQ7TPA|5|I really dislike knit pjs so this is great!  It is transparent but nice and cool to sleep in.  5'3, 145 lbs.  got large and it's fairly large but for a nightgown I don't mind.  Pretty and soft.  I got pink so darker colors may not be as transparent.  May get another!
B003H6DCBS|5|Love it
B0073E4X7W|1|I ordered the mask because I wanted to wear it after shaving my head for St. Baldrick's Day. I chose the cheaper one because I wasn't going to shell out $40 for the Xcoser ones for a one-time gag for my students, and while I wasn't expecting a movie-quality mask, I was expecting something better than this. It looks like it was painted by a kindergartener, outside of the lines with reckless abandon, looking nothing like the display picture. To top it off, it is stretched out and too large... and I have a pretty big head! Absolutely disappointing, as Rubie's Batman mask was excellent.
B0070NUBMC|5|Product as expected. Fit is perfect. Very comfortable and cool to wear in the summer.  Great service and product. Thanks
B00DAGUMW2|5|This is exactly what I was looking for. The fit was perfect.  As a 34D the medium is just right and doesn't slip.
B00MBE3MDK|5|Love the shirt and material. Little larger than expected, but roomy. :)
B000MXWWBK|5|Wore it for the 4th of July.  It looked great and I was proud to be seen in it.<br />God Bless America.
B003G2Z6SK|4|They're exactly as advertised: grey, slim-fit Dockers. No surprises and no disappointments. Regarding the slim part of the equation, they're definitely not recommended for men a bit thicker in the hips and butt--so middle-agers beware. Although I'm in my late middle years, that is not a problem for me, as most of my fat is situated in my head.
B0027P8JG8|4|I ordered this for my grandson who is 1 year old.  My daughter says it is made very well and it's nice to know when they are out in the cold it will keep him extra warm.
B00BSEV7W2|4|looks very nice. sizing to me seemed a bit small. all in all it was a good b u y
B00HSR6CR8|5|Great fit, looks good.  Great for Gym, Pool or loungewear.  Love them have them in almost every color
B001FXH8YM|4|I like it
B00BSEBIBM|4|Works as advertised.
B00K7HTQJ2|5|as a size 6, 5/6 130lbs this 30x32 worked great for me. The stretchy jean fabric is comfortable without the 'stretchy' look
B008601WWG|5|My girlfriend got this jacket for my Bday! thanks soooo much Bonita!!! Great Great blazer! Good quality and amazing design. U don't see something similar everyday. Definitely a great purchase. I just loved it.<br />-
B00EVH4XNS|5|This is a very good shirt for working out....comfortable, wicks moisture away from the body and is a good value. Easily comparable to similar type shirts costing 2-3X the price. I would rcommend.
B00AFJPO7A|5|Purchased this shirt as an adjunct to Light It Up Blue (April 2nd) for Autism Awareness Month at my son's school celebrations.
B006QSOXQW|3|Just received this shirt in the mail and realized I should have ordered a smaller size. It is a fantastic shirt that I will need to return due to the size being one size too big for me. I ordered a medium because that's what size I am, but that came to big. Great materials and look forward to receiving my new size.
B002EB06MU|4|The material is great! I don't worry about the sweet giraffes scratching baby- the stitching on the toes is so cute!<br />We have this in two sizes.<br />The hat is too little- and it's a shame because I like the design! The hat from the larger outfit doesn't even fit baby while she's in the little size outfit.<br />Otherwise we're thrilled.
B00K9EQJ1Q|3|I bought this set for my daughter who is just starting as a massage therapist. The top fits her well but the pants are cut very odd. They were low in the back yet very baggy in the crotch. She was not a fan of the pants.
B00JLDYL0C|4|If fits as expected the only thing that I did not like is the bottom part of the zipper, it was kinda making like a bubble pocking out, other than that I really like it.
B004ZWHFIO|5|Thank you.  These are the best socks I had bought for my 7 year old daughter.<br />I will recommend them to everyone.
B00JUHJJU6|3|Nice
B006PI0IUI|3|dont drop
B007OX447Q|5|A little larger than expected. Well made robe.
B004AGCZ6W|5|VERY nice and classy
B002MTFPIE|4|Flannel lined jeans are a staple for me for winter, and these are a great buy. The denim is sturdy but soft and comes out of the dryer wrinkle free. Flannel is very cuddly. I had gained weight so bought a size I knew would be ample enough and comfortable.  That said, I still find them a little baggy in the thighs, and may take them in there.  Otherwise, I'm really pleased with this purchase, and this brand.  I would definitely look for more brands from this manufacturer, and will buy a smaller size of these soon =)
B004ZWESQ6|2|I really did not like this at all. Just got it today and it's already packaged to go back. The collar isn't pinned in any way so it moves forward and all out of whack, the shoulder pads aren't pinned either so you have to adjust them each and everytim you move/put it on, a button was missing and the fabric is cheap. You may as well put in another $15-20 and get a legit one.
B001505UH2|5|Be sure to order a size smaller.  The material is thin, but I knew that from the reviews.  I love it.  Just great for my poodle skirt!  Malt Shop Cruise, here I come!
B005ML9MYW|5|I think the price was right (about 14 dollars) and the wallet seems to be of good quality. The triforce symbol looks gorgeous.<br /><br />The only think I do not like is the chain, but thankfully you can remove it without any problem.<br /><br />Reccomended to The Legend of Zelda Fans!
B00DJMDJAY|5|I love this coat, and the best brand. I could not have picked a better fit for my man. He loves it.
B00AFUGRDO|5|I placed the order a week ago andi go it today so yeah it only took a week<br />Damn im glad and the bag is awesome i really like how big it is :)
B00J0VCU76|4|Basic socks at a good price.  I would recommend turning them inside out and washing them once before you were them though.
B004UULJOW|4|The skirt was a little big, and the top a little short and slightly tight. Totally wearable and good quality in general. I pinned the skirt back so it bunched more in the back, which made the sizing look better in the front. I loved it and will definitely wear it again!
B004VQPNXS|5|This brand washes well, keeps its shape and colors don't fade quickly.  Guess that is the best thing one can write about underwear.
B00ATB16NK|2|After waiting 3 weeks to get these leggings, they finally arrived. I went to go try them on and they did NOT fit. I am 5 foot 2 and the leg part fit nicely, but the material is not stretchy. In the description it says it could fit women up to 5'7&#34; and I don't see any way that could be true. They didn't account for people who don't have flat butts. They ripped as soon as I put them on. Save yourself your time and money and don't get these leggings!
B00BVCKSVC|5|Super cute shorts. Fit as expected since I am a size 4 bottom and the medium for perfectly
B00VQAAFQ2|1|very small
B00NJBLRNQ|2|not the same lace pattern as the picture and I don't know how I'm going to wear it😂
B00EHL2E3O|4|I like it because it fits comfortable ,the material is very soft..I Aldo love the the bright color.i would mind getting another one.
B009429IKI|2|I got my wife (110 lbs) the extra small and it is still very long and large.  She is 4 months pregnant and only now does it fit her.
B00451ATAG|1|This shirt is just as described and shown but I never like to wear it because it is too darn heavy. Its humid in Miami and even at night it can get me hot. This shirt is a heavy weight cotton so beware.
B004LEUVY6|5|I got this for myself and my boyfriend, us both being huge Zelda fans. I love that it is not this huge, heavy keychain, so my keys aren't ridiculously weighed down. Shipped quick and is exactly how it's pictured!
B004NBY3UU|4|Love the pants and the color.  Pant was a bit on the snug side, but still fit.  Definitely would order again.
B005GINLVQ|5|Durable micro-fiber-like material makes wearing this shirt a pleasure. The top is attached to the long-sleeve part and doubles as a hoodie if needed. I could sit back and bury myself in this thing all day! lol
B00IABZQ1O|5|I'm a huge fan of the Green Lantern - Green Arrow story arc, so this shirt is a treasure.  I also bought the long sleeve version. 'Nuff said.
B003DKSY0M|5|After looking at numerous styles, me chose these and are very happy.they have the perfect blend of casual and professional.
B003F9QLDI|5|although I'd like a black one, the brown tracker goes well with my Sagittarius colors, I have my every day hat shaped for eye protection from light, flattened in the back for sitting comfortably in the car (it has a high headrest) or taking a siesta this almost forces the sides to take a rollup form with the left side wanting to flatten out it a true to life aussie style. #2 is my sunday go ta meetin hat.
B009X9DHAO|3|comparing to the price I paid, its not bad. but not as I expect.<br />the quality of work is not perfect. but still nice.
B0038E0J8I|1|I bought the dark blue wash of these jeans and it was so nice that I came back online and bought it in black. Big mistake. The black and blue are made of different materials and the black feels inferior and fits poorly. Fast forward, one month later, the jeans zipper is broken. I expected much better quality for $60 before tax. If you must buy this, stick to the dark blue wash.
B008JGGD4Y|4|I first bought the smaller version but after noticing the lack of room I upgraded to the XL. When I first received it it worked fine (just like the smaller version) However, over time the same problems I had with the smaller one started to occur with the XL. So to all the people that are planning on buying this wallet here's what will happen eventually:<br /><br />First, because of the poor hinge design (on both small and XL wallets) the small metal pin (or plastic) will either break or slide out. Thus, not allowing the wallet to close correctly. To fix this I took two small nails, banged them into the two small hinges then cut the nail heads off. Every once an awhile I'll notice them slowly start to slide out again. Just bang that area on a hard surface to keep them in place.<br /><br />Second, Because the clip itself is plastic it will eventually break. Now on my smaller wallet the small metal pieces came out and I had to replace them with two small nails. BUT with the XL as I am experiencing now. The plastic lip that is under the open and close switch is almost completely broken and I'm on Amazon to look for a replacement.<br /><br />I can't say for sure how long each wallet lasted me, but It's definitely been awhile with the XL. Another Con I can think of that I didn't state above is they're really smooth which means if your wearing sweat or gym pants these wallets will slip right out of your pocket( especially if you keep your wallet in your front pocket like I do). Otherwise, not a bad wallet.
B004HW29YW|2|This product does not possess the quality it espouses.  Upon first inserting a book of checks, the already loose stitching tore three stitches.  The plastic flap for protecting carbon copies does not cover the required spaces where writing occurs.  However nice the grain may look, please take note of the stitching.  This is, at best, a fair product, and your money is better spent elsewhere.
B000M9N042|5|It is somewhat large but I expect the item to shrink a little since it is made of cotton.  I also like the deeper front pockets as I keep my gym id card in there when going to the gym.  The pockets hold the card well with no problem of falling out.  This product will probably out live me and so I expect to get great service out of it.  Just sorry I haven't purchased some of this Russell brand before.
B001U9Y9SO|5|This diaper is the best of all the diapers I've ever tried. I've tried countless pocket diapers, fitted diapers, and prefolds, but I keep coming back to the tie nappies as my favorite, and have since sold all the rest.<br /><br />It is also the strangest looking diaper I've ever purchased, especially when it comes to you new from the mail and it's over 4 feet long! It will shrink a bit after washing and drying, however, and folding it just right becomes an art. :)<br /><br />PROS:<br />1. All cotton<br />2. Natural, unbleached<br />3. Soft<br />4. Breathable<br />5. PERFECT fit from newborn to potty training which other one-size-fits-all advertise but don't always really \\"fit\\"<br />6. Contains messes wonderfully<br />7. Washes well and dries quickly<br /><br />CONS:<br />1. Must use a mesh laundry bag for laundering (I put 3 diapers in each mesh bag) or diapers will become entangled in each other<br />2. Requires some time to learn how to fold and tie the diaper just right<br /><br />It is recommended that one use a doubler inside the diaper, whether that be a prefold or pad is up to you, in order to increase the absorbency as these diapers are thin, almost like a knit summertime sweater. HOWEVER, I have not and still do not use doublers because I have found that the diapers are plenty absorbent as they are. I have used these on my daughter from 2 days old til now - 16 months - and have never felt the need to add anything to them.<br /><br />Diaper cover required.
B007C7CQ1U|4|1
B00H4GL29Q|3|Overall it does add curves.The only problem that I have is when you need to pull it down then back up the pads fold in half.
B0000AUYV3|4|The Hat is great, the size runs bigger than I anticipated
B00P4W5QUI|3|So cute but sooooo thin. No padding at all and no liner. I can't wear it until I sew in padding myself or nipples are visible.
B00LIV1QDU|5|I have a 6 month old, and this dress fit her perfectly. It was a little scratchy, but that is to be expected. The sparkles have stayed on well, and the dress photographs beautifully. The shrug is also perfect and soft so works very well as a winter dress.Overall I'm very happy with it.
B008TMPSR6|5|For my husband who is always losing ONE GLOVE!!  Don't let the inexpensive price fool you - they are warm.
B00HAYHTYO|5|the material is really soft, no itchy feeling, i'm loving the color, a nice deep red that goes great with my leather jacket.<br />totally worth it.
B00BPSOTIU|1|Like the reviewers before me, I bought this belt for less than thirty dollars as a Gold Box Deal. After a large weight loss, I needed new belts, and offering three different styles of belt at a reduced price in quick succession seemed like a good opportunity. For the price I paid I am content with the belt, but I would not pay the regular price listed as I post this.    The leather of the belt seems satisfactory, the reversible buckle is a potential weak point. The buckle is somewhat loose and rests at a slight angle to the rest of the belt that won't make a difference in normal wear, but doesn't inspire confidence. Unlike one previous reviewer, I don't feel uncomfortable at the durability of the finish of the metal, but I can't swear it will be great either.    The leather in itself is fine. The black side is very satisfactory, the brown isn't as pleasing to my eye, but I can't point out any genuine flaws. Some may care that the edges of the belt are not beveled, but are at right angles.    Comparing my belt with a nonreversible belt I purchased for a similar price at a Target department store, I don't see much difference. I am content with this purchase for the price, but would not recommend it at any price much above $30.    Update, January 2015    My original rating was three stars, but I revised to one star when the reversible buckle came off at the pivot point after less than a year of normal use.
B000XP0FDY|5|Material: a very soft, evenly-dyed glove leather (goatskin). Perfect for casual to \\"dressy\\" wear in spring, summer, and fall. Too soft for construction sites (unless you're the boss and don't plan on rubbing up against a nail). Collar and flap-pocket snaps are black-anodized (I bought the jacket in black). Vent grommets are brass. Zipper is YKK metal - not plastic - and very smooth (I added a leather zipper pull). Woven cuffs and waistband are the soft kind and tend to fuzz a little. Lining is uninsulated khaki material with American flag stencil and nylon sleeve linings. Nice leather-backed \\"Air Force\\" label.  Fit: Perfect for my size (L) and the 1940's fighter-pilot \\"blousing\\" around the waist is exactly right as is the lay of the snap collar and the curve of the epaulets. A whole bunch more comfortable than my old, heavy, $300 one. More authentic too!  Construction: Seems to be CAD-designed and made. Obviously modeled from an excellent original . . . maybe an Eastman. Extremely straight seams with turned edges. Evenly stitched everywhere. Feels like double-layer leather throughout, but not heavy at about 4 pounds. The back is three-piece leather rather than one-piece . . . a detail disliked by pilots for reasons of comfort on long flights in steel seats. Not important to me and even the L.L. Bean \\"Flying Tiger\\" version is three-piece at $289 or so.  Bottom line: While nobody is going to confuse this A2 with one of Neil Cooper's thick-leather masterpieces, they're not going to believe you paid a hundred bucks for it either. After a week of wear, it was my favorite jacket. After a month it's starting to take on some character and I am very, very surprised at the number of compliments I get.
B003ZW1AEU|5|These capris are exactly what I was looking for! Comfortable fit in the waist & fitting through the legs. Will be purchasing more!
B00DJM5FLA|1|This mask is not what you think. The material is very flimsy, like thin rubber. The material has a terrible smell ana I can't stand to wear the mask. Also the shipping time was ridiculously long and it arrived late!
B00JY7KRH6|3|I generally fit in xxl, but these are tight.  I recently lost 25 pounds and can fit in this shirt now, barely.  Nice shirt though.  It gives me something to work for.
B002N8EPB2|5|Arrived on time.  Very happy
B009F1KRO4|5|I got this hat to wear as a ski instructor for little kids and they, and adults, love the hat.  I get comments all the time on it.  It keeps me warm, although I am generally active while wearing it so that helps keep me warm too.  It seems pretty well constructed, hasn't frayed or anything yet.  I would take it easy on the eye-pieces because I'm sure they could come off as easily as a button or something but I have not experienced problems with them or the nose.  Shipped fast as well.
B001UHMZOG|2|38 but is large for that size,bottom part is definitely too large.<br />Material nice,color nice,delivery very fast.Overall so so for the Levis.
B00DR1EZ64|5|WOW!! Who would have thought that after a millenia of belt design that you could invent something better than a hole and a buckle. The ratcheting belt mechanism is wonderful for those of us with rapidly changing waists (up and down LOL). The company stands by their product and clearly wants to have happy customers (if you cut the belt too short, they will exchange for a new one free).<br /><br />Now if only their canvas belts came in non-garish colors I'd order one of those too. Buy it - you won't regret it.
B0010ZC1BA|1|These are a nice quality fabric. There is a lot of spandex in them though. And they ended up being a waste of money because the size is much smaller than written.
B00RT1KB98|1|This top is extremely small, it could fit a child. Definitely not what I expected and I would not recommend this to anyone.
B00CN47HS4|1|this sweater is nothing like the picture or description posted. Its very very tiny, and I am a small person at 5.2. It does not fit loose or  very long and the arm holes are made for a child. Its very thin knit and should not be considered a winter sweater. Again it does not look or fit anything like what is pictured.
B004YT4LQM|4|It fit perfectly!! Everything about it was amazing but I do have a couple small complaints. The leg accesores wouldn't stick up alone I had to get double sided body tape ( not a big deal) and the design material kinda started to crack once I put it on, so unless your careful, you probably can only wear it about 3-4 times max. But I just needed it for a Halloween party , my boyfriend was subzero and so I went as kitana,  it was still a pretty perfect outfit and party !!
B00K7TTFDW|4|This leotard is very cute, but definitely not true to size. I read the reviews before purchase noting that it ran small so I thought it would probably fit my 18 month old perfectly. I can't imagine a 2 year old actually fitting into this, as my daughter fits it perfectly. Material is very soft and definitely serves its purpose for her toddler gymnastics class. Also note that this is more of a dance leotard and we have to watch out for baby wedgie when jumping, climbing and rolling.
B002HYMNSO|1|Motherhood Maternity underwear are terrible.  Almost every pair I owned developed holes and ripped seams in a VERY short period of time.  Don't waste your money.  Just buy regular panties a size up from your normal size.  My friend who has had two babies (and gained 65 lbs with first and 45 lbs with second) recommended I do this and I wish I had listened to her!
B0037TMAZO|3|Love the shirt, but get a size smaller than you are used to.
B008O471PG|5|its a little small in the back, but all in all its good. My gf gets a kick out it.
B004NRM8M4|5|As expexted, very confortable
B00OZPKK4W|5|A shopping is very perfect, the quality of clothes is very good.
B00CYMD3MY|5|Nice shirt great fit
B0088X2IH4|4|thanks
B00NN139AG|2|This is honestly the first review I have ever written on amazon, but I feel a little compelled to write something based on the quality of the product we received.  While the outfit was very cute, it held up for no more than two hours.  There were a couple problems:  1 - the pants continually came unsnapped, which led me to have to try to snap the pants together while my 14 month old was trying to run around and have fun.  2 - the seat of the outfit ripped almost immediately.  My 14 month old son wore the 18-24 month old size to a wedding over the weekend.  And while the visual of his ripped seat of his pants was kind of hysterical, I was disappointed in the quality of the product.
B00IZ2BVU8|5|Absolutely love this hat! I don't wear hats very often because I couldn't find one that I enjoyed wearing. My fiancée is in the air force so when I wear the hat it makes me feel like he's sorta with me wherever I am, I went camping this weekend and sadly I lost it in the water. Ruined my whole rest of the trip. But hoping to get another one soon!😊
B0040TRV18|3|I picked this due to the styling, but I agree with the other reviewer that it can only be worn at home and during the day. It shows through clothing and is very stiff. I also had a c-section and the directions advise you to wear it lower, but that makes moving around a bit difficult. The amount of compression is strong though, so that part I like. Still too early to see results.
B00O8EFJJG|3|The product is like 2 sizes smaller than it says.<br />Fortunately, it fits my sister so I didn't have to return it.<br />Besides de size, it's comfy and just like the picture.
B004ZWESQ6|1|I returned this jacket. With the price tag and the many MANY positive reviews flooding this item, I thought I couldn't go wrong. But I really didn't like it. For reference, I'm 5', 100lbs and I got the small, but it was too large.<br /><br />This jacket is not soft or comfortable, but rather, stiff, kind of thin and a terrible fit. The thinness of the material made it look kind of crumpled around my torso, and it kind of puckered out at the bottom, above my hips.<br /><br />If you really want to get this jacket then go ahead, but read more negative reviews before you decide if it's worth the risk.
B00QWW72EM|2|We have purchased 3 rash guard bathing suits (Gymboree, Carter's and this one) for our daughter this year. Two fit perfectly,  but, unfortunately, this very cute bathing suit was so tight the top would hardly go on.
B00FI9KC7Y|5|Adorable
B0000A12UV|5|I got the dark blue shirt. It's a nice shirt, high quality. My only complaint is it's a little big around the middle, so for a skinny guy you have a lot of extra material. I guess they want a shirt that even the heavy guys will be able to wear. That said, it's a well made nice looking shirt.
B00SHYR0FY|5|New favorite Chemise. Very light, comfy, and cute
B00CTX521S|4|Good quality product.  I paid for 2 day mail and it didn't show till the 4th day.  I had planned to wear it to an event but that didn't work out.
B00CTGBZN4|3|Runs small, button fell off with first wear. Would not purchase again
B00OXN6UBS|1|Obviously, I didn't read the description very carefully.  These are indeed soft and cozy, but I was horrified when I saw the picture of a mink on the tag.  China has a terrible reputation for the most cruel fur farms in the world.  If you love animals and object to fur, don't buy these.
B00CXSH26M|5|Perfect
B00CFA9UTA|2|None is like the photo , have a top ugly bun.
B00KV64F4U|5|It's too cute!
B005I33OVG|5|They fit nice and tight with an adjustable wrist strap. Nice and warm with pure Carhartt  quality.  I recommend them and they look nice too.
B00F2ZX4ZQ|5|I wear this hat all the time!!! I would like to order a few more in a variety of colors!
B00D8XQMDA|4|When I first put it on it was a little too long for me.  Im not that tall either (5'5) so I decided to wash it and see how much it would shrink.  After I got it out of the dryer and tried it on, it fit perfectly.  Over all it looks nice but something you would find at walmart kind of fashion lol
B003CN0SV8|5|Was looking for cold weather boot socks to use for ruckmarching because they make it so I get absolutely no blisters.  These socks did the job. Great quality.
B002GHCHSI|3|I'm 6'8 but most of my height comes from my upper torso as I only have a 33'&#34; inseam. This is a comfortable and warm hoodie, but I wish it was about 4 inches longer.
B00PVVQC50|5|I am not the normal person who buys these. I wake up incredibly early and walk before work. Incredibly early. Even though I live a a pretty warm place, I get cold at this hour. Scarves get gross, ear muff don't cover everything. These are the perfect solution! They wash easy, don't feel gross when I am wearing them and really keep my entire face warm.<br /><br />You can't beat the price, and I feel that the quality is pretty awesome too :)
B00WG11YL0|2|I ordered an extre large and I have to have someone help with the closure...
B008683910|4|Product is just as pictured, The fabric and the construction are great! I genuinely wish that their sizing chart and measurement guide were posted on each of their Product Descriptions. Had I found it before ordering I would have known to buy a smaller size.  I waited to long to try it on and now cannot exchange it.  I'll be taking in the corset at home and look for a replacement when at ren fairs. To help others, here is the companies charts that should be in the product descriptions:<br />Size Chart for Bodice Corset Sets:<br />xSm/Sm - Bust 28-31/Waist 24-27<br />Sm/Med - Bust 32-35/Waist 28-31<br />Med/Lg - Bust 36-39/Waist 32-35<br />Lg/xLg - Bust 40-43/Waist 36-39<br />xLg/2xLg - Bust 44-47/Waist 40-43<br />This is an adjustable bodice, it is better to be too small than too large. I recommend taking your actual measurements and deduct a few inches depending on how tight you want to wear it. It is better to be too small and leave a larger gap in the back than to be too big.<br /><br />How to take correct measurements:<br />BODICE - Measures aprox 12&#34; from center front to point<br />BUST - Measure under the arms and around the fullest part of bust line.<br />(This is not bra size. This bodice needs to be worn tight so it doesn't fall off. Measure at the tightest measurement you want to wear it at. Note: since you will be wearing a lightweight top underneath, it does look ok if there is a gap between the laces)<br />WAIST - Measure at waist level ~ all the way around.<br />(You will have an elastic waistband under this from the skirt, and the top tucked in, so just measure it snug, not too tight or you won't be able to breathe)
B00428RTYQ|2|Of course the wig arrived flat so you'll have to &#34;fluff&#34; it out some but, the &#34;poof&#34; is a ball of mess. Looks a like a rat nest. You have to comb some of the straight hair over the poof but it's not enough to cover it good so you have to pull more hair from the straight pieces that hang down. It sill does not &#34;poof up&#34; right. Looks nothing like in the picture unless you want to work at it awhile.
B0069RYSSI|3|compartments for credit cards are pretty tight.  hoping wallet will stretch
B0029R7OH4|4|its ok
B0057MF0V0|1|Just don't.
B00JJIO2Y4|3|Little bit small but not to bad!! Very sexy shirt!!! ❤ it
B00M4K29Y4|2|Too small
B00B58GOBA|5|Great everyday pants, these pants are so comfortable and can be worn either professionally or causally.
B00DTH1HY4|5|Best fit ever
B003H17XWW|5|excellent product recommend
B002R9GD94|1|Bought three of these thinking they would be skinny and hip, but not skinny and far from hip! I would not buy this tie again. OldClown
B0017WZTM4|5|Adorable.  We get tons of compliments on these cute socks.  They launder well and the color assortment is great.  Love them
B00CL8ULUS|4|I really like the color... it matched the top great I was trying to pair it with. I would buy it again in a different color.
B00542WQ56|4|After reading the mixed reviews about sizing, I ordered my average height/weight 10 yo son his regular size, 8-10. The sweater is HUGE! I have no idea how big the 8 yo kid was in the previous review, but he certainly couldn't have been in the 50th percentile! The sweater is adorable, light-weight enough for my son to wear for golf (when he grows into it!) Love the vivid colors. Will be great for fall with a turtleneck or long-sleeve white shirt. Will keep the sweater because I got it on sale and would cost me more to send it back than to just keep it. Just wish the sizing was accurate. Be aware when ordering!
B00JJ5FIEU|3|I fell in love with the picture and ordered the shirt in orange.  A couple of things to note:<br />1.  When received it was more a rosy orange - not too bad but not what I envisioned.<br />2.  Size - the size chart showed a Medium fitting a 36&#34; chest size approximate size 8-10.  The shirt ran small - I could not even come close to buttoning the buttons.<br />3.  The material is very thin.  You would definitely need a tank top underneath.<br /><br />So it's going back and I hope the seller approves the return.
B007R6W1RA|5|I have bought these before a stores, first time online but fits true to size.
B00EKO2DEI|5|These briefs are well constructed from good quality fabric, and the sizing is good (I ordered XL and these fit like XL). This was my second order of this product. I especially like the robust construction and the design of the concealment pocket; which can easily accommodate a wide variety and size of items.
B00TI8YRQS|5|Even more gorgeous in person!  Princess couture with a 3-bone hoop skirt (bought separately).  Worth EVERY penny for a special celebration
B008CV5HMK|4|Love this dress…..very pretty, fits as expected but I have to take it in at the shoulders and at the armpit to fit perfectly.
B00JZKWC2K|2|Quality was fabulous, but the 2xl was more like a large. It wouldn't even wrap all the way around my chest area. I usually wear xl. I wish it wold have fit correctly because it was beautiful!
B00LW3QR06|5|Fits great and looks nice on my son. Haven't been worn yet. Getting school clothes together.
B00K3334T8|4|Somewhat large, but it's okay to me.
B00CPWBE4C|5|Great selection of sizes to fit all my shirts.  So much better than the cheep plastic ones that come with the shirts.
B00JEYAHBA|1|Unfortunately this product is too big
B0052BALY2|5|I really like the quality and the fit.  The short length is what I needed.  I am sure they will wear very well.
B00E925YXI|5|This dress is super cute, it has a unique design. I originally ordered it as my bridesmaid dress, but it's so classy I wear it work. Very nice with the chiffon fabric and matching belt.<br />I'm 5ft2 and hourglass, so when I first ordered 8P it was a little tight in the hips. The 10P fits my 36&#34; hips just right.
B00719WZ0G|5|Comfortable, perfect fit with wide upper body but still narrow waist, won't look like a skirt. Also it's thin and warm at the same time. Way warmer than it looks
B008U6123A|4|I have not used these yet but they look like they will work good.  Ordering my purchase was fast and easy. It arrived on time and was packaged very well. There was no damage to the product and the product is made with good quality material. I will buy from this seller again. Thank you.
B00505DW8W|4|I read previous posts and got the largest size I could. I really liked it, even though the Velcro cape attachment was kind of cheapy. It did the job, and my 4 year old nephew loved his auntie wonder woman.
B009Z3X20S|5|Purchased for a 9 year old boy in medium. Fits great. He is a fan.
B00AT90J5I|5|These seems to be much better in quality than the white and sky blue training pants that Gerber use to sell almost a year ago. These have more padding which is good during small accidents.
B00P9UOGCY|5|Go to Paul Frederick clothing and see what You pay for this tie, to late to send mine back.
B005CSNVLU|3|Shrank the first time I washed it
B005MFHCRW|5|Wonderful jacket
B008BG9LMI|3|LOVE the bikini & design but to me the top is more like an XS and the bottom between S. The bottom just barely fit so that's fine but the top it's way smaller than expected. I\\"m only a C cup and it barely fits too, so I have to be careful as too how i put it on, so there won't be any nip slip.
B00BCUP8A4|4|Beautiful well made jeans and the dark blue &#34;horizon&#34; color is gorgeous. I'm 5'3&#34; and 153 lbs. and the size 12 short still fit a bit baggy under the rear area. I exchanged for a size 10 short and they fit better. A bit snug at the waist but still comfy. Great value for the price!
B00B9LCK7A|1|This portion of my order was sent but 3 out of the 6 balloons had holes in them. My sons 1st birthday went on without balloons
B004JCQ518|2|There's no way these are supposed to fit someone with a size 12 foot. I have a hard time keeping them on - they just slip off because they're about one size too small. Very odd. My pack must've come from the Reject pile.
B00ICQ0D8S|5|This is a beautiful hat. I can't wait to get on the beach in Maui and wear this gorgeous must have accessory.
B0009W0B6M|5|work perfectly for me.my belly was to big and when i got this WAIST CINCHER lost little bit my belly with in 6months
B009G0OO7U|2|My wig came in earlier that expected, but it was really thin and it was already falling apart, leaving blonde hairs absolutely everywhere. The inside of the wig is easily visible through the hair, so I have to resort to wearing a beanie over it.
B006RUAKO8|3|Very cheaply made. Stitching was terrible across the front so much so that I had to wear a handkerchief headband to hide the stitch. Luckily that style worked with my 80's hair band costume. It would a lot of work to make it look even remotely like the picture in the ad.
B00D1HKWZW|5|This bra is awesome! I love the fit, the softly contoured cups and the comfort.  I'll definitely be buying more, especially if I can get them at the fabulous price I paid for this one!  Great under tee shirts.
B00B5GDECY|5|Well made, material feels sturdy, perfect length (inseam, 10 inches). The leg bottom circumference is 21&#34;. Perhaps a cell phone pocket would be welcome, but as is, the fit is perfect. I am planning to order 2 more in other colors.
B00DDUBHYC|5|WOW! I was skeptical because of the low price, but this dress looks and feels like a high quality garment. The knit feels nice and thick, not thin and clingy and cheap. The fit is perfect and the color is unique and feminine. It's better/prettier than most of the tennis dresses I've purchased at a much higher price. Grab one while they last!
B00ORORTLI|1|tine dress
B00MI6JX1G|5|Very nice jacket indeed.  It fits hubby perfectly.  Its quite well made and substantial.  I accidently ordered two jackets and the company quickly sent me a return address I could send the jacket back.  Customer service well done!!<br /><br />This is a jacket you will have for many many years.
B00RDFEXGC|2|Out of the 6 pieces, 2 were small. The rest fit perfectly. I dint want to bother with the return and replace, so using the rest
B00UCN4D1M|5|I ejoyed the colors, the fit and the quality of the material which does not wrinkle, cling, or scratch.  I have bought similar dresses in high end stores and these are as good at a fifth of the price.  However, I bought two with the same wavy design and the back seams on both do not match.  I use some of these for at home casual wear and have learned to select all over prints since seam matching is of no concern.  I love them for cool summer wear and comfortable travel items that can be rolled up in a suitcase, add very little weight, and come out perfect.  I also love the range of colors.
B00JN58KHI|5|greaT
B0084AXE8S|5|Great fast service, product received in time for Christmas wrapping. Good customer service.  Would use this vendor again. Great price and great size availabilty, thanks very much.
B00NB8IJHE|4|The fit on this shirt is snug.  Unless you like your shirts to fit tightly, you may want to order a size up.
B00AAHBOA8|2|Run way too small
B001LKH574|5|These fit nice and snug. They run small. I am 6'1&#34; 185 LBS athletic build and size large is a snug fit. So if that is not what your looking for go for XL.
B006K11DHC|5|Nothing better than a pro 2A Jesus patch. The stitching of the pattern is very solid, great quality. GET IT
B00H3Q8ZP6|5|It fit great  they are good material is great. Good fabric.
B00PAM7G32|4|My daughter is a major Stitch fan, it was a bday gift, she likes it!
B001V9ALUS|5|love em
B00QXRXRBS|5|Good quality shirt! Fits perfect! Very happy with purchase.
B0041HPUQC|5|Very satisfied with the hat and will order another in different color.
B008Q072IO|5|This is a very nice bodysuit. This is the first time I bought one like this and I am very pleased with it. It doesn't ride up all and it washes and drys easy. Wearing a bra is not a problem. A+
B004TQH658|5|The fit was great and the jeans are very comfortable from the first wear.  I will order more of the same again.
B00FFYEIVI|5|This was a gift for my 95 yr old mother-in-law to keep her legs warm in the winter. She seems to enjoy them.
B00LTFDZBQ|5|This is one of my new fav's!!!
B00FGL79BQ|1|very loose fitting, not great quality yarn. one sock is a full 1-inch shorter than the other. make sure you check that before wearing them. i've seen other similar-priced socks in stores but with much higher quality. they work okay scrunched around your ankle, but no way they'd stay up as shown in the photo.
B00EAO6448|5|These are great!  I was looking for a higher waisted panty to wear after my c section, and I think these are going to be perfect.  The fit seems spot on and they are very soft.  I'll most likely be purchasing a few more packs!
B001I90BUG|5|Awesome product.  I have a larger head, and they just fit.
B000QV3GH2|3|I really love this bra, it is comfortable and the straps never slip down my shoulders.  However, I only gave it a 3 because the plastic clasp has broken twice now.  The first time it broke was less than a month after I purchased it so I sent it back and got a new one.  Now the clasp on the replacement broke after only 4 months of wear.
B00H22U3I8|5|Arrived on time and looks great!
B00JULYF9W|4|I really like these shirts.  Very comfortable and feel thicker than the comparable fruit of the loom brand.  It's also easier to find the back, with the white printed tag.
B005Q7VLSW|4|Good buy
B0071A153I|4|It's basic, it's a t-shirt and it's the color shown in the picture.<br />Doesn't sound like much but this is more than others get right.
B00KDPHWGM|2|nice
B0009S6TJY|5|I was shopping for a nice Darth Vader costume for Halloween, and discovered that the costumes don't come with gloves. Thus, I decided to find a nice pair of Vader-appropriate gloves, and these totally fit the bill. They allow for good flexibility, and overall seem to be durable. I'm excited to put them together with the rest of my costume.
B00GO32WYY|5|Bought for a bday gift and she loved it!
B00I4501OS|3|Smaller than expected. Nice shirt, just VERY fitted.
B009PO8C52|5|Not too heavy, not too light - it's just right.  the material is acrylic, but it will do just fine.
B00AQ2Q9FM|4|these are super fun but if you are using them in a flow class the waist will fall and can be distracting.
B00D6BYPXS|5|Love these pants.
B008OGHF3C|5|These were a Christmas gift for my daughter and she loved them. They also fit her really well.  I would definitely buy another set.
B00RCKZ8BC|4|Nice for home wear no support for going out in public...get ready to bounce!
B001OMJ2VG|5|I was very pleased with this tuxedo and company. I bought it for my son's Prom this spring. It was less expensive than renting, he'll have it for next year, and we can pass it down to his younger brothers.  When it arrived the shirt size was too small so I sent it back and a larger size was quickly sent out. Everything was good quality and only a hem was needed before he could wear it. We were extremely pleased and would recommend this tux to all.
B00X9TGAQM|4|good quality
B00DWBH9SK|5|Bought this as a birthday present for my husband. Our little boy loves batman and loved seeing his daddy wear these boxers!
B00EE1Z4NY|5|Exactly what I expected. I'm very happy with the quality and the overall ordering experience. This was definitely worth it!
B00J5C1WWE|3|I like the style, but it a little big to me, and it is not soft as other cashmere sweater that I bought before.
B00DUU5KCU|1|Worst misleading purchase on Amazon ever!!! I order one size larger, than I would need for my pregnancy.Ordering size 14 large, So it would fit through August . I was only size 7 before I was pregnant but wanted to be comfortable, the top has cute print but wouldn't even cover my belly at 4 month's it is just a cami not even maturity. ..don't order this it was waist of time an money very very disappointed ,sad the company who sells this is completely fine with disappointing women in such a way.
B00FKMC44S|5|It's a good product because it protects your phone. The case is rugged and protect the phone it is a good case.
B00KAPNWSM|1|I bought the red panda, but they sent me and one different.. with a ridiculous girl... I hate it..
B00KYT2PLO|3|I am concerned because it was way too small, sizes that were listed are incorrect.
B00IAA89PK|4|I love this shirt....honor to wear....he is a symbol of dedication.
B00K53940Y|5|I must say this product fits very very nicely! As soon as it arrived I took it out of it's wrapping, and by the way someone took great care to put it in a very expensive looking bag. I showed it to my daughters who thought how lovely the pattern was, they rubbed it against their skin because the silk was top quality silk so it was very smooth! Save your Nickels and dimes, and purchase it'll be worth every penny! One more thing I want to add is that normally when you wear this type of thing, if you raise your arms you can see all under your clothes. But they took great care to sew this particular product so that nothing personal is being seen.  My husband was quick to point that out.  So if you're trying to be comfortable and guest show up, you can answer the door with confidence!
B00E17V8SG|5|Very nice hat. Wear it to the beach all the time. Everyone around me is roasting under the sun. Not me, this keeps my head nice and cool. Also, Amarillo Sky one of my favorite Country songs. So i like that too.
B00HT3WIH4|5|as described
B0052780U8|5|Went very well with my leg lamp costume! My boyfriend is a fairly large man and it fit him perfectly.
B00M1LERM8|5|Love this! perfect for beach days! Stylish and well made, thanks!
B00AYZCJLO|5|Good quality, great color, they fit very well, well worth the price and I would purchase again when i need more.
B008NC872K|2|Yellow is not my color.
B001A40BPY|5|Toasty warm toes
B00I1078II|5|Love it
B00A76J6WU|5|I bought this as a Christmas present for my teenaged son.  He loves it!  I bought him an extra large. (he's 200lbs)  It fits perfect, with a little room to spare. Great price, but shipping was expensive!!
B000FH9RMU|2|...when one of the garters fell off.    POP!    So much for that. It didn't even last one day of Dress-up!    Save a little more and buy a good set.
B00KNPYAIU|3|I dont like the material
B00E7Z7RSM|5|Bought as a gift: recipient loved it! It took just under a week to get to me, but I ordered it on a fri, so to be expected. Everything good.
B003VVR7UG|5|Our 18mo old has big hands and feet. I'm so glad that the 4T-5T still has the skidproofing. He's been walking for well over 6mos but is still very klutzy. These socks wash well and go with most every outfit.
B001618J5U|4|The only complaint I might have is the fit in the stride is somewhat close, but other than that, they're great or horseback riding!
B00GXKXXSC|5|Good quality, fits well. Overall good workout shirt.
B005O9VQG4|3|It was what I expected for the price. I'm just wearing it as a throw away garter for our wedding so it will work.
B003N9BT3M|1|I PURCHASED THIS BRA IN A 36DDD, IT IS NOT SUPPORTIVE AND THE WIRE UNDERNEATH THE BREAST IS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE. WASTE OF MONEY!!
B00GIPO2QY|4|A good legwarmer in a hard to find shade of dark grey. The darkest color grey you'll find before you go into washed out black. I will say they slip some, otherwise I'd have given 'em five stars.
B00GQOSFBA|5|so cute
B00JAAHDBU|5|Ok
B00NHQV7Z6|1|This is not what I expected at all . The material is crappy and cheap and it fits weird ....this isn't wanted at all but I'll probably just end up keeping it because I don't wanna go through the process of a refund.....wouldn't buy again....
B00S7QLV34|4|i like it
B000A38JSM|5|Excellently made and thicker than your average t-shirt. In 80 degrees it was substantial overkill and I had to change out to a lighter shirt. Convenient pocket and pen holder inside.
B00PBG579M|5|Cool color. Comfortable as usual.
B00HNYXZM6|4|I have one pair of these from last year and loved them so much that I ordered 2 more pair. These are a bit shorter than what are pictured and also shorter than the pair I already have. Other wise they fit true to size. I am 5'4&#34; and weigh 128 lbs. and a size 11 fits to a tee. The quality and comfort are very good.
B008MPV996|4|It is a good quality belt. It was easy to snap my buckle on, and it appears well-made. Great value
B000VSGAG4|4|not good leather at all... be aware of that.   other than that it's a pretty good case for the ipod
B004SW9N9K|5|Bought my sister a small pair. She's approximately 5' 8&#34; and 140 lbs. They appear to fit her just fine. She sure likes them.
B003Y5IBE0|4|I purchased these for a photo shoot. They were cute and just what I needed. I'd recommend this product to anyone.
B005Z44QS8|3|Its not xxl in my opinion.
B00R97EJ5Y|4|should have ordered one size up but i liked it
B00TYWXHJ6|5|I bought a Small and it's a true small.  Very comfortable and stretchy.  These are perfect for my yoga classes.  Glad I bought 2 pair.
B006PI26FS|3|Had a different brand before.  It was larger & I was not happy with this particular one. Will keep just because my other one is broken. I cannot find these in the stores anymore.  They are only online which is not convenient.
B00I9L62KO|4|These leggings are nice and soft, and appear to be very well made. They are a lighter weight legging, and probably more like a pair of footless tights, although the brushed softness of them makes them a little more substantial than that. They won't keep me warm during a Minnesota winter, but will be very nice for Spring or Fall temperatures.
B00AEEFVLA|5|Good quality tie. Not as wide as traditional ties and not as skinny as skinny ties. a.k.a friggin perfect.<br />The plaid design is pretty nice too.<br />Definitely a more contemporary look without being too hipster. (i hate skinny ties like i hate skinny jeans)
B004OA7QT0|5|I ordered these, not thinking too much about them, so it was a very pleasant surprise when I got them, used them, and realized they are the PERFECT onesie.  They are super soft cotton, not too thin and not too thick.  Instead of a collar side snaps or snaps down the back, these have the criss-cross design on each shoulder which is designed perfectly to provide the extra room when pulling on/off and they don't result in a too wide and awkward-shaped neck opening, which I have found to be the case for some with the same design.  And the best thing of all that I love, love, love is the additional row of snaps so that the onesie can be used over a much longer period of time. To me that alone justifies buying these, but the fact that they are also made well and are super soft... yep, I'm sold!
B00939U07C|1|I have never had a sock that has made my legs swell; however, there is a first for everything. Love the look of the sock; but, most uncomfortable sock...EVER. Made my legs swell, my feet sweat, and borderline impeded my circulation. By the end of my 14 hour shift I practically had to cut my socks off. It was a very weird experience. I have always thought socks were just socks until I wore these.
B00GB7FY8O|5|I love these pants they are very comfortable and soft they are a tad bit long but I'm a short person so that's probably why
B00IMWHVKU|5|Very nice and cute.  Fit is also great.
B008LWR8NQ|4|Love the shorts.... Just need an elastic waist adjuster!!!
B00KDL81W0|5|The trousers are very good, fit and the same picture
B00J59DXQU|5|LOVE! SO soft & cozy. So excited to wear it.
B005E1KR2Q|5|I bought this wallet for my fiancé who loses everything - phones, wallets..anything you could fit in your pocket. If it's not attached to his clothes/self, it's gone! I got tired of having to cancel our joint cards and ordering new ones or getting replacement ID related things, so he suggested i get him an inexpensive wallet with a chain and i saw this. He still has it, so it works! also, the wallet is pretty durable for the price, so it's a perfect gift for anyone who tends to lose things (or fears getting pick-pocketed).
B00FSK0QE2|5|This is THE little black mock turtle neck to get if you want something light yet fitting close to the body to layer under sweaters and such. Because it is longer in the torso, you can tuck it in and it WONT creep out! Very soft and comfortable too. Love it! Arrived on time as promised with absolutely no quality or shipping issues. I may have to order another one just to make sure I always have it at the ready! 100% satisfied!
B007O3RZVI|5|This costume fits so well and I love the style. The colors are true to the picture and I would recommend it.
B00CTH8VS0|4|I bought two sets of Rare Editions outfits with leggings,  one in 6X and one in 7. The size 7 legging is smaller at the waist than the size 6X.
B00JXLYVK2|3|this hat looks nice but was smaller than described.nice white hat with black band that would have been good to wear to a 1920's themed party.
B00DQV49P2|3|The gloves are warm and affordable. But smartouch doesn't function unless your fingers are right over it. And because the contact area is so big, it's hard to use. It's acceptable if it fits perfectly but if it's a bit loose, get ready for some frustration.
B002IEXJ8G|2|It is very faded but works
B00IJYFIYM|4|Good fit, great feel. Socks are worth the extra money.
B003HC8RVC|5|Great socks!  Cotton rich socks for every season.
B005PQQ166|5|Perfect fit (having already owned a few of them) Dockers quality.<br />Quite happy with them, will definitely buy a few more
B00P36YNFE|5|My son loves it.
B00C1ILZG2|5|Very cute onesie!
B005GYGFZY|5|Spalding Women's Bootleg Pant, Black, Medium: LUV, LUV, LUV these pants! They are cute, soft and comfortable without the shapeless, grungy look of sweat pants. I wear a  4-6 in regular pants but always size up in this type of pant. They fit well - no baggy seat, but not too revealing. I wear a 32 inch inseam and these are to the floor when new. They shrink a tiny bit in the dryer; but are still long enough. I prefer to damp dry in the dryer, then air dry and they don't lose any length. I've had one pair for a few months (wear them every time they are clean) and recently ordered 2 more pairs.
B0072NJTUU|5|super comfortable, very soft, very delicate material ... good for training. Totally recommended.<br />As always NIKE developing good quality sweatshirts.
B00O5OJ4EU|4|too big. Was able to return for exchange with no problem.
B002N5SQPG|3|I'm horribly disappointed. I just received my top and I had ordered a 5X, expecting it to be nice and roomy. What I got wouldn't even go over my chest. It fit like a 2X.<br /><br />The product came quickly, was packaged fine, and was in pristine condition. No problems there...it just was not a 5X.  I have to send it back.
B00D6DVKWU|5|I love how this jacket looks. The lining is super soft, and the collar/neck is snazzy. I feel like a secret agent in it.
B009TB1DTS|4|The quality is really great for the price, but the overall fit was just like a regular beanie, not &#34;oversized&#34; like described. It doesn't have much of the slouchy look I was looking for.
B0027VT5TC|4|Great costume. Can make is as alluring as you like.  Wore to work party with sleeves up, then to evening party with sleeves off shoulder.  Fun!  Great price too.
B004Q8DD2E|3|I ordered this shirt for my husband for Father's Day.  It's fine enough, but I don't think it will last.  There's already a little hole in the screen print that looks funny.  And the t-shirt itself is pretty rough and scratchy.  Overall, it's okay but definitely not great quality.
B00HFKE4H8|2|Must be for a toddler. Hats are always big on me, but this was impossible to get on.
B00EF42GBS|5|Great quality T-shirt, fast shipping.  My Dad loved it!
B00M92O9QI|3|In order to make this suit work for me, I had to remove the inner mesh lining around the torso, then sew the top to the bottom, otherwise the cups pulled down too far on my chest and it was uncomfortable. Beware: the cups are very stiff and pronounced (a la 50s, I guess). It is a cute suit though!
B00N71GEEU|4|Good fit
B00K8GICJM|4|Cute and fits well
B001OZOMWW|5|I bought this tux for my son who had two proms to attend rather than pay rental costs on separate weekends.  We were extremely pleased with the quality, fit and the speed in which the order arrived.  I would definately recommend this product.
B00SZ7X1OM|5|The shirt is totally awesome<br /><br />This shirt is totally awesome. It captures the character with such vividness. A must for a Sleepy Hollow fan
B001FOR2D8|5|Excellent quality belt, very durable.  Just what I expected.  *Note it is a little wider than your typical web belt but that worked out well for me.  I will be ordering another in black.
B00K0DO78S|5|Ordered this shirt for a masquerade ball.  I am 5'4&#34; 120lbs and the size small fits perfects.  The lace is nice and thick.  Very good quality.  I love this shirt!  Typically, I am pretty frugal and would not spend $40.00 on a shirt, but it is so versatile that I think it is worth every penny.  Looking forward to wearing with jeans, paired with a nice skirt or pants for work/evening.  Great purchase!
B00DHQYQ5Y|5|I like the material and color (blue) and I wear it a lot. The material is soft and<br />comfortable.So, thanks!!!
B00E20ITHK|5|Very nice. Fits as expected.
B00J4TJIYC|5|Fabulous, the boys looked fabulous.  Great price, fit perfectly.
B00VAXK59C|5|Nice T-shirt that fits nicely and did not shrink much or fade in the wash.
B00R5F21Q4|5|Quite cute. The bottoms run a little small, but overall I'd say the fit was on par. In general, with swimsuits, always order up a size of your baby isn't super lean.
B00DMEG3W0|1|I wanted a red dress, this dress is more of burnt sienna. I didn't like the color as soon as the dress came out of the wrapper. There was NO return allowed. Thanks Amazon. Dislike this dress because of the color, the fit and quality was fine. Return policy very disappointing. I really hate the color.
B00C10O1VQ|5|Very comfortable and more fashionable then your &#34;tidy whitties&#34;
B00RRLIY58|1|Idk not really happy with this purchase, doesn't look  like the pic when put on, and the metal peices  are  actually plastic
B00CLEAA08|5|The shirt stays are good quality material. I tried them on my shirts and for every size they are a perfect fit.
B00T25AX2Y|1|No tags, it looks used. I'm really upset I wasted my money
B0073HA10W|4|Like the fit. The white piping is kind of a drag. It shows under tight shirts or lighter colors (like a pale orange top).
B00A7PJTNW|1|My wife ordered me one of these shirts.  I just received it and although it is sized as an XL, it is way too small.  I'm not a small fellow, but I generally wear an XL, and I'd be surprised if this isn't about the size of most men's mediums. I'm 5'10\\" of average build and my arms don't fit in the sleeves.  When I went to try it on I thought it certainly must be a boys size, but no, it's tiny.  Too bad, I like the look of it.  Don't know how it would hold up.<br /><br />We should be warned the sizes of these run at least TWO sizes small.  I would easily require an xxxl.
B00IEP1KFC|3|I ordered two different size jackets 1 A XX Large and the other xxx large and neither one of them fit right for me so I gave them to the next person and they worked out just fine
B00Q2P8OWS|5|Still has good support and it keeps your boobs from bouncing to much when your running
B006PHXUOU|4|I bought this wallet for international travel, since a lot of other countries use RFID chips in their cards and I wanted to avoid getting my own cards with chips scanned. Most of the contents of my old leather wallet fit in it, though you really can't fit that much more than what the description says it will hold (about 9 cards, I think, and I managed to fit 8 plus things like insurance cards). I did have to leave some things out that I normally carried with me, but maybe that will encourage not to hold so much clutter. It does hold cash if you fold it cleanly. I also like that, because it's in a shell, it's size is fixed and fits in my pockets better than my old wallet.
B00LTG5E8C|5|Satisfied.
B00EE2N3CW|4|ec¿xcelente
B00E8AIE06|5|Loved my leggings!!!! I can't wait to wear them out! Made very well!
B00FQV45ZY|3|The pale mint green is not at all as pictured in the photo.  I returned them.
B008FCY5LU|5|Love it
B00540GZUU|4|Nice product that seems well made!
B005C17712|5|This shirt is comfortable, the sizing is accurate, and the print on the front is good quality.  Overall it's a great shirt and one I would recommend.  It's one of the favorites for sure.
B00JG5W85U|2|I was very disappointed in this. The material is very thin & the robe is much shorter that I expected.<br />I am a tall fat guy. This is for short fat guys.
B00EG0KTME|5|I got mines today its a little small but I plan on going on my healthy life journey so I don't mind working hard to be able to fit it
B00DCCVUQG|5|went with a medium, very forgiving, will look better when I lose my belly.  love the material and the color too.
B00KM6OAJ4|4|Basic swim shorts that fit fine. They were on sale too, so no complaints here.
B001SKO7EQ|4|I am really happy with them! I ordered the lavender ones and they were sassy yet subtle. They are a tad big thought, after wearing once they stretch out.
B005FO9CHS|5|It is both comfortable and looks fantastic
B00GJ2OBFS|5|Loved this cardigan, fits great, drapes beautifully.  Wish it wasn't quite so see through, but still love it, considering buying it in another color.
B007KFZGYS|5|I wear a 50F and I was afraid that this bra wouldn't fit, this bra does fit perfectly. It feels firm and it slipped on easily. I even did a little shimmy and the girls stayed put and didn't shake all over everywhere like normally. I can't wait to wear it! I hurt my knee so I can't workout for the next two weeks but I'm eagerly waiting for my knee to get better so I can go back to my three mile walks. Great buy and it's not too expensive.
B00NPBYDXG|1|It is very small
B008NCYBJ8|4|a little thinner than I had hoped, but for the money its a good product.
B007I8DQP8|5|Great
B00FOSEUMW|5|Great socks so far. I have tried many no-show socks and these are the only ones that do not slip off or bunch up at the hill.
B006IY6H8Q|5|I do not begin to understand the dark magic at work that enchants the tips of the fingers to bend a touchscreen to their will. With no outward show of difference, nay, nor any sticky qualities whatsoever, yet the hand clad in these wondrous gloves does possess the power to swipe, to click, to type. I pray this power may be used only for good and not for, say, taking wanton selfies or uploading food porn for all to behold. Also, they warm the hands they thus bewitch and look comely with winter outerwear. Huzzah, noble touchscreen gloves!
B009ZTYROM|5|Very classy tote bag -- will carry it when I don't want to be discreet.  This is a good buy!
B00MFUMB6O|3|This is a nice, light fabric.  It has the same words printed on both sides, and I was hoping for different text on the sides.  It was also a bit pricey for the product.
B00DRUYJAW|3|Luckily I read reviews and knew to order it a size larger. I am usually a medium or even a small depending on the brand. I got this in a large and it just barely fits my shoulders. It is a super cute coat and I really like it. It's not as flattering as I was hoping for (a little box like, but wearing the belt extra tight fixes that)<br />It is a thick fabric and pretty warm.<br />The reason why I only gave it 3 stars is because it started falling apart. It's not super serious, but the lining is falling out, and there is a hole in one of the pockets. I only bought it a few months ago.
B004XYMQ56|4|This belt is made of a nicely prepared bridle leather.  It looks sharp and gives the impression that it's well made.  Amazon needs to correct its description, though: I've never heard of a \\"bridal\\" belt.
B00DGMA28Y|2|Based on the reviews and item description, I ordered a medium. The bathing was overall too big. I would have been better off with a small but I don't think a small bottom would provide enough coverage. The medium barely gave enough coverage.
B00SLPDXLE|5|Fits as expected. Love this sleeper!
B00K5BJD48|4|The texture of the cloth is a little too smooth but no complaints with the length and fit.<br />Goes perfect for casual occasions.
B00JLAFZFK|3|This was cute but the Dora on the front is a harder vinyl feeling material. It looks slightly faded and my daughter complained that it was scratchy.
B005OB02M6|4|I Love the shorts, but they were bigger than I thought they would be. I ordered a medium and wear a size 6.
B00EGGM052|5|My husband loves them.  He said they feel good on.  They stay snug and don't stretch out of shape.  He really likes that!
B00NTUG7IM|1|I was soooo pissed when I got this... The material is polyester and doesn't fit well at all. After seeing what it looked like on me I  throw it straight in the bin. It was unless to me and didn't look like what was advertised.
B00L4C6SHM|5|Very nice.  Recommended.
B0039VWOLA|3|Great shirt, if you like wearing sausage casing. Wore it once(pre-wash) and all was well with the world.<br />Washed it.<br />Now it fits my forearm.<br />Buy at least a size up, maybe 2
B00AAKLF22|5|We have seen this same product at office stores for so much more.  This was a great deal. It is sturdy, functional and protective.
B001285LMG|3|Skimpier than others of the exact same kind and size I bought 3 years ago.  They changed the design and I DO NOT like it.
B00E5OGRJ0|5|I love the quality, the fit and the color-buttercup. It arrived quickly and I'm very pleased.<br />I have since ordered another one in red.
B00MVOTP6I|3|I wore one time and now its stretched out. Im tiny so I think they are not meant to wear other then around the house and without boots or shoes.
B003VOVK2E|3|if you got a huge head, this will be way too small.
B003LO21AO|5|Great shirt but attracts lint from 2 counties over so be careful what you wash with and get a lint brush if you have pets
B00CBO9Y00|5|I got this for my sister. Since she is a little busty, I was not sure if it was big enough. When she tried it on it was a little large on her but she liked it a lot. Good price.
B00DS2Z6CE|5|They look very sharp and are true to size. I have received many compliments on them this winter.
B00A3XYED8|5|Good
B00BXRJ0FA|1|I normally wear Large...I ordered Japanese XXL, USA XL, and it was still too small.  And there is an extra button hole...odd.
B005QR8OP0|5|I like this shirt, its exactly the right size and how it seems in the pictures
B00R56ZJLW|5|Love, love these jeans. You will have to order up a size. I am usually a size 8, but I had to order the 11. But, I love them.
B00N1IHQUA|4|Product as described. The color was very close to the picture, a little lighter gray which I liked. The skirt is a full skirt, but not to the point where it is overwhelming. The slip underneath is also roomy which makes it so the lining isn't uncomfortable or rides up or anything. Very flat when it arrived, but I just followed the instructions and fluffed it a bit and it looked great. Crafty people could easily add additional layers underneath or pair with a petticoat if desiring a fuller effect (only recommended for sizes 2-6). I'm a traditional size 6/8 for skirts and pants and this fit fine. Also 5'2&#34; and this was a midi-length for me with platform pumps on. My only dislike was the quality of the waistband as it looked a little childish. It was scrunched shiny satin, matching the lining and I did definitely wear it on my mid-upper waist. Overall, a great 'Carrie Bradshaw' inspired skirt for an amazing price!
B000TA8LJ8|3|I wear a size 12 and I also have a wide frikkin' foot, yet these socks are still kind of loose on my feet. They are extremely cozy, but not the best for tight-fitting work socks or socks one wants snug to their feet.
B00H1P2B5E|4|It is well made and the picture does it justice.  My Gdaughter (almost 7) has a thing about Frozen and would wear it to school if she could.  She's happy and Im happy, less one star for price.
B0084FZRFQ|5|Bali Women's One Smooth U Bra With Lace Side Support, White/Soft Taupe, 34C fits and feels wonderful.  I just had to have breast surgery and the doctor told me I needed a bra with side support.  I purchased many other brands, but this one fit the bill and made you feel beautiful.
B00E7XDGSY|4|The dress I got is actually a pill dress, which is far cuter. It's just a little bit too big (or at least it was at my summer weight) and rides up when you walk. I'd say it's more a Medium than a Small.
B009FG8FMU|2|socks don't stay up they bunch up around my ankles. Also when I think of wellington I think they should have come up higher on my calf.
B003XYA3GG|5|I pulled this mask on over holloween and my Grandchildren were very surprised to say the least.  The price was right and the fit was just right for my big head!!
B005NB4PI4|1|I know it would not be the best quality based on the price, but this thing is bad. There were bits of red stuff all over the packaging, It is just all around a poor choice if you want a santa hat
B00C7ISTII|3|Was much shorter in the torso and arm length than I expected
B00CTUTXJI|3|It will need to have some fitting done to give the looks that it deserves to. Material is uncomfortable and there are a wire or two coming out from the material of the dress but I am gonna keep it anyway and get some fitting done.
B00B4YDKYY|5|Saw this in new mexico and fell in love but it was forty so i was super happy to see it online
B00A0FCBBQ|5|love it
B008AWYQN2|5|Fit as expected of Dockers, Good quality. I did have to shorten for my husband, but knew that going into the order.
B00MHTT8VE|1|Not true to size
B00LPPB8VE|5|For my granddaughter and she loved it.
B00JFBVZN6|5|Nice shorts
B000MXB6NA|5|Here's a bra which is excellent in every aspect, comfort, uplift, flattery.  The magic is that after wearing it for the whole day, you go to unhook it and the back is still in the exact position it was when you put it on.  Now this is special.  Most bras will ride up a little, or some of them a lot, at the back.  This one doesn't and that's amazing.
B00C7YJMRE|5|The jacket was a Xmas gift, only problem is with the sleeve length. When my brother extends his arms the sleeves run to his wrist. He likes it so that is all that means anything.
B008LWSBAK|3|Other than the size running small it is a good item. I will return it for a XXL.
B00J66NB7I|5|Bought this for a winter vacation to the Virgin Islands and it's perfect.  It also makes a great swimsuit cover-up.  The material isn't at all see-though but it is very thin and light-weight (but wont wrinkle!). Also, the key hole in the front and arm sleeves dip quite low, so keep in mind that it would be very difficult to wear a bra with this dress.
B00AFNP750|5|I have looked at other brand but the Haggar pants you can't beat for the price. A well made pants, fashionable and comfortable.
B00DV8E4YG|1|Just like all the other comments, this item is way too small. I measured and ordered the correct size per the size chart.. its still too small.
B005RR238I|5|An absolutely perfect fit on my size 12 very curvy body. Stretchy in all the right places. Flattering and comfortable!
B007PIT2BI|5|This dress looks just the pictures and is lightweight. It is really pretty and the prefect dress to wear anywear. Really happy with my purchase.
B002RYXC5C|5|I love these mittens.  I bought these in large thinking that they were sized for Women and they were too big for me.  My husband took one look at them and off he went to use them.  I reordered in size small because medium was out of stock.  They are just right but I tend to like my things a little bit bigger so they are easier to slide on and off so next year I'll try the medium.  I can't ask for a better product.  They are very warm, nice looking and not too bulky.  I can drive with these on and even hit the key pad on my garage to open the door.  The shipping and customer service were second to none.  Well worth your time to consider.
B00NGS6B8I|4|Awesome fit! Good material.
B009HUGETA|2|The color I ordered  was listed as  navy.  So not navy.  It is more of a dark teal.  Fabric is nice.  Very disappointed!
B003H145LY|5|Still would have liked to pick the patterns/colors, the random choice is not my favorite but I do like these everyday cotton basics.
B00D1R7X7W|5|I bought this to show off the ladies during a hot night with the boyfriend. He absolutely loves it in every way. The feel is smooth like satin, the hooks stay clasped, the blue is exactly as shown, and it fits just right. The g-string that came with it was a bit long in the crotch area, but fit fine around my hips. (I'm a 33-27-33). I ordered a size smaller than what I am, just so the boyfriend could have fun lacing it up for me :)<br /><br />You have to buy this! Amazingly sexy!
B0049A6AVK|5|These are very beautiful gloves.  I would definitely recommend these to all my friends and family.  they are well made too...
B00IULA2CC|4|I ordered a 2x but really looks like a large. It's good quality tho.
B00DNI8AZ8|5|I loved these padded underwear! They make my butt look really good, not to big just right. I ordered a large and I'm usually a med in underwear.
B00H7QL45A|5|Nicely made product, good assortment of size, will probably last forever!
B00JKD1X5O|5|I love this outfit the picture does not do it justice. Fast shipping !!!!
B005N7YZ74|3|A little tight for all day wear.  The material isn't as breathable as I would like.  It works though!
B00GPG8JIS|3|Color was pretty.  Material was heavier than I was expecting.  Live in a hot climate so I returned.  Having second thoughts now because I guess I would have worn it in in-between seasons.
B0097P8OF2|3|I have several Miraclesuits. I ordered my normal size. This one didn't fit that well. Too short in the torso. It pulled.
B003XZWK7K|4|Good tight fit for dance
B00U2B4TZY|5|Love this. Looks super cute and fits very well.
B00NFSGO90|3|The cotton is a bit thick and stiff but decent, I wish it was higher quality or at least softer.  I love the picture!! I wish the fabric was higher quality and was more comfortable. I can't wear it all day long because its not super comfortable but I lOVE the picture.
B00NOUYIG0|1|Wrong product. Sent a SHIRT, not the hat. No desire to figure out how to send it back to China....
B005PP4FCO|5|Love it and the colour!
B00E0M9B9A|4|Snug fit but look great! Love Liverpool jeans. Boot cut very flattering.
B00CRNZV7K|5|Everyone thinks it's hilarious when I wear this!
B00DOL44JK|5|My 3 year old son was recently diagnosed with Autisnm Spectrum Disorder and I wanted to find some clothing and other accessories to spread Autism Awareness. I really love these t-shirts. They fit well and the colors are great. I would recommend these t-shirts to others without a doubt.
B000ETYJJA|2|Doesn't support very well!
B00CAHPAGK|4|True to size.  Amazing color.  Great material.  My 15 year old son said that when he got out of the ocean, the suit did not stick to his legs.  He would have loved if they had a waist pocket with zipper to hold keys, money, etc.
B00OBGOHZS|1|The quality is compromised a lot
B00G0PIGPK|5|I bought the XL in these because I have very long legs and wear a size 12-16. The L would've fit but I like extra roomy pjs. These are perfect and super comfortable! They are very soft and I'll definitely look for more patterns of these pjs in the same material.
B00G5NDK3U|5|On time.  Perfect.
B00331C0TW|5|great
B002OWVWTA|5|This hat I bought about a year ago and it has held up well.  I wanted a top hat that was sturdy and looked authentic; it was worth the splurge.  I have used it as a driving hat on sunny days (gives a shade to the eyes while leaving clear peripheral vision); it has been used in a play (the Mad Hatter wore it); and I and others have used it in costumes just for fun.  It is a trifle big.  When my hair is braided starting high on the head it rests comfortably; otherwise, it likes to slip down.  I did specifically choose a large size, though, because I would rather have something a little large than something too small.<br />It has been a delightful piece to my wardrobe and still looks good as new.
B00ENU1HUA|3|It's ok. Kinda big
B00C81BY4A|4|The fabric feels good and I loved  the package!
B00BTWAZP8|3|Quality of product its fine, I love colour too, but this classic cut its too wide!<br />I buy but I will not used, I'm very small and there is not size for me.
B004U0IRGU|3|The colors are great! i like how easy the batteries are to change, however, I am not a fan on teh big electronic box that rests on the inside/outside of the palm. Worth the money and will last awhile.
B008P5O724|3|I ordered an extra large but they shipped me a size Medium. I am having great difficulty in getting some resolve.
B00FK8ZFGQ|5|Perfect fit, just as expected.
B00IOFBT8K|5|I love this dress, but it does run a tad big in the chest.  I am a 36 C and ordered a medium.  I doubt a small would have fit:)
B006OK7UKI|1|This is my first time ordering, site unseen, clothing from anywhere. I ordered this t-shirt in an X-LG for my brother-in-law. I was so shocked when I took it out of the bag and saw how small it is! My husband wears a medium t-shirt and this fits him, with no room left over for any shrinkage!! So as my title states, buyer beware! If you need an X-LG or a LG, I would NOT buy this tee, I'd look elsewhere. There's also a store, with a J and a C and P in the name (ends in a Y) that sells the Southpole brand for cheaper. The t-shirts there are also true to size...which I didn't know they carried before ordering. The fabric is nice, the graphic is nice, however since the size is so off, I cannot give anything other than a 1 star and I definitely would not recommend this tee to anyone.

B003VVT5DS|5|I miss Jordan...Product shipped as you could expect to APO/AE. Good thermos, run a size small. When your laundry gets done in bulk you better make sure you get a bigger size, otherwise you will end up with a thermo half belly-shirt; and we all know that $*** hasn't been cool since Westly Snipes in White man cant jump. \\"Lets go billy ho!\\" and what was up with that stupid hat? Poor Westly...,Hope you get out a prison soon homeboy, Pay them Taxes!
B00MSF207Q|5|good
B00HN27CEU|5|Adorable!  Perfect hat for the first birthday!
B00CKGQY66|3|This outfit is absolutely adorable but it does run a bit small.  The pants are like skinny corduroy jeans and even the top could use a little more room.  My daughter is long but not big and we only got one wear out of it before the top  and bottom were hugging a tad bit too much.<br />On the other hand, she loves the little jacket for the buttons with the fake rhinestone look.  Every time we look in her closet, she wants to touch it. :-)
B00IW3MF7I|1|The pictures are misleading. The skirt is extremely short on one end, and too long on the other end.
B00167T8QS|4|I travel enough to stop using the airplane name tags so bought this.  works well.
B0059WBRP6|5|I have found that this style fits me the best, so I continue to only buy these. It is hard to find this size anywhere but online. They hold up very well. Material is soft and gentle on your skin.  Very comfortable! I will buy more. :o)
B007R4IYXC|5|Excelente.
B00E1IG6JQ|5|Had problems with the zipper where the waist is a big snug & hangs up.
B00AQ0J9TM|4|np
B00HWRR8B8|4|like the feal and look she alsow liked them verry sexy , she gets excited when i whear them out in public shee cant keep her hands off,cool if you whant to feel sexy or look it
B00EW49YEI|5|The wallet is beautiful and practical. Not to mention, the seller was extremely helpful on some of my doubtful questions.
B00EHZI1U0|4|Very pretty, but runs slightly small.
B00HDA951U|3|These unfortunately look already somewhat faded and washed out.  I did not expect a stonewashed look.  The red might be nice were it full bright as the photo shows.  I see no fading on the photo of the jeans
B00AFYFAJM|5|So cute and &#34;couture&#34;! This is THE perfect scarf ESPECIALLY for the price. The white part on it is a little grey(er) than I expected but I actually like it more that way than the bright white pictured here. I would highly recommend. It is long enough to style several ways and lightweight enough to wear this summer. So. excited. about. this. purchase.
B008BRBNJ6|5|Fits true to size, maybe slightly on the small side.  So, if between sizes, I would recommend sizing up.  My daughter is a size 8, average height and on the skinny side, and the 7/8 fit her well, although another inch in length would have been nice.  The pants have two rows of Velcro to adjust the waist size, which seem very sturdy.  Overall a well-made pant.  Great for NH winters.
B00K16GD22|5|The swimsuit was a little too big but with the adjustable straps we made it work. This suit should fit my little girl for at least two summers. I feel like I totally got my money's worth!
B008TUUOPY|5|I was surprised when I received this top! I bought it b/c I'm pregnant and wanted to wear something cute and different. Well, it's definitely more of a costume look for me, but maybe I'm just too old or something. It's really nice comfortable material and nicely made.  Probably can't wear it into my 3rd trimester though. :)
B0002TW2IM|4|I've been buying Gold Toe socks for my husband for at least seven or eight years.  Although we've tried picking up other brands, the Gold Toe are his favorite.  The cotton is pretty soft, they stay up around the ankles, they last at least eighteen months, and they don't develop holes too quickly.  This most recent pack feels a bit thinner than packs we've bought in the past, but I imagine that they'll still hold up fairly well and won't need replacing for quite some time.
B00EOAU1WO|5|This costume looks and fits great! It flows as you walk, I really felt like a goddess :)
B00L6EK8K6|5|Nice and soft.
B000Z4MJA0|5|Perfect! Comes in a garment bag, good quality. Fast shipping. Exactly what I was looking for. Comes with sash and head scarf.
B002LG0J0C|5|Hat Trick seems to really enjoy stealing and chewing the crap out of this shirt. May be the color? Perhaps the flavor?? Who knows but out of all my t shirts, this one is his choice. It is now fairly battle scared but continues to hold up. Well made, a bit thin on the cotton weave/weight. As ex-USAF I am proud to wear it.
B0029AV4SG|5|Ordered this for my niece's 4th birthday present, a dress up trunk. It fit perfectly, and it was a big hit with her. It's very pretty, and she loved it!
B009DZOMAW|4|Very nice, it fets my wife perfectly... good buy, perfect to ride horses and also as a casual top, my wife is very happy
B00IRW7D9O|4|What I expected but doesn't fit in arms so need to return
B00IA5ZHGY|1|:( not good
B003552NVG|5|I love it
B007MF6Q3G|5|For the money paid for this wallet I expected a high quality product. The dish wallet is exactly that. Durable yet fashionable.
B00HYU0766|4|Its a nice set for the summer
B00DN14GSA|5|EXCELENTE
B007FPPUUS|2|It's not what i expected too big for me
B00S8ZY820|5|I like the way it looks and feels!
B00JE87412|5|These are really great quality for the price. We were pleasantly surprised by the thickness and fabric of these leggings. Will be buying more of these in future.
B003H235HS|5|This product is great!  I gave it to my 3 yr old son and he loved it!  It's adorable and made well, easy to operate and safe for little ones.
B00VCTGA7A|5|Being my first time ever ordering anything from this sight I was really worried how the dresses I ordered would come out but they turned out great! They came in exactly like they were displayed . It was fast shipping and I can overall say I'm very pleased with my first purchases from here!
B002U2XGMU|3|not worth much as a whole piece on some sizes.  Good enough top for the $  You can't get the top alone any cheaper.
B00MQ2R4DQ|5|Looks even better than the picture shows
B00I3CAAIY|1|Cheap looking and crush with wrinkles
B00J6DE8O6|5|Lovely. The &#34;something blue&#34; that I was looking for.
B00YQDLBUU|5|Love it
B00UJHM97Q|5|Exactly what I expected
B0018OQSGC|1|Horrible jeans.  There is no way these are real Levi's!  Wrongly sized, and thin as a piece of paper!  I will never buy this product from Amazon again.
B00CKN7Q2A|2|It was way to big but its very cute
B007F2HZTU|5|This is my favorite hoodie. I love the style. It's also comfy. I have a slim figure, so it fits very well in that aspect. I'm also kind of short, so it is a tad bit big in length. The bottom of the hoodie fits tight; I wish it wasn't as tight, but it's nothing you can't deal with. I just end up folding it up from the bottom when it's zippered. I'm just pointing out the things I would change about the hoodie. By the way, I ordered the small. Overall I love it. I'd recommend this too a friend 10 out of 10 times.
B00MOTE8SK|3|will use as a backup
B00LIWLLZM|4|quality is very good, but ...<br />sleeve is too long,<br />and width is to small
B00BPM2SBQ|1|Size charts listed with this company don't match. Deceptive sales practices. they list a chart on the item in terms of small Med large etc then there is an attached size chart with numbers 10, 12 ... 18, 20 with no corresponding references to the chart listed for the item.
B005904OV2|5|I've already worn it, and it is good quality and the fit is perfect.  I'm gonna get the white one!
B0018OHCXA|5|Just as they should be but delivered to your front door.
B007PESR40|3|They're underpants.  not much to be said other than my 5 yr old loves them and they fit.
B000067BJQ|5|Bought this and the Batman playset for christmas for our 4 year old superhero lover. He still puts it on about 3 times a week and flys through the house saving the day. Great dress up set that lets him have even more fun with his imagination.       Set says young adult size.......but it is ok for play on 4 year old..he can get it on himself just needs help to tie in the back. The ties are starting to tear a little as he trys to take it off without untieing it.      I think this set was worth the money and would purchase more of them if they became available in different superheros.     I had to add to this, it is now almost 2 years later. My 4 yr old is 6, his brother is 3 and sister is 1 1/2. They ALL play with these costumes. I have not had to fix anything on them, the ties are pulled some but we just tied them loosly and the kids just crawl into it. They have a blast with these. Wow, I just realized what a truly great toy this is... NO BATTERIES!!!, it has been played with a lot (and not gently, this is superman and batman after all!), it's still is in good condition and my kids (all 3) all still like them. They also get a lot of exercise playing these superhero's, saving the day and all. Buy these. When my kids friends come over, they like to dress up in these too.    I purchased these at Christmas 2003, it's now 2011..Wow! Time flys. That 4 year old is 11. The 9 year old is big time into legos and my 7 year old girl is now more of a princess than a superhero. I finally retired our superhero costumes last fall. The chest plates went to goodwill so some other children can enjoy them. Yes, they were in used, much loved condition but I think they still have years of play left in them. I couldn't part with the capes. I have them tucked away for the next generation of superheros that come through my house. These costumes have provided me with wonderful moments of my children in them being nothing but imaginative, wonderful, fearless kids. The thought of these costumes still brings a smile to my face and wonderful memories.
B00LIRYVWW|5|The size is my fault as I ordered it as a gift. It is a very good and comfortable jacket though. It is very well made and I highly recommend it to anyone. I may exchange it for a smaller one of this same type because this jacket is fantastic.
B007GBYPZC|2|The shirt size is perfect, but the length is way too long.  We have ordered 2 Red Kap shirts and the story is the same on both of them.  My husband looks like he is wearing a pajama top to work if he doesn't tuck his shirt in.  It will be great for winter time if it was long sleeved but for summer, this shirt is a fail.  The material is fantastic and it is one of my favorite shirts but we just can't have him wearing something this long and tawdry looking.
B003ZJH6T6|5|He already had a few pairs, just needed a few more colors.
B00CGL1I6G|5|These shorts are perfect for the little gymnast in your life.
B00BHB7OVO|1|Bought these and received some weird version of the pictured leggings. Mid thigh length &#34;shorts&#34; that clipped to other pieces of fabric that go on your calves. Save yourself the money and do not buy these.
B0058ZW7XA|4|Good ... I like the fit and feel very comfortable.<br />This needs some more warmth as when you wear that in Cold conditions does not protect you completely.
B00TOH4X94|4|Great quality and beautiful on. I'm having it altered it was big on top and tight in the middle. I'm a larger girl so I ordered a size up hoping to take it in if needed.
B002J146VM|5|I've had this jacket for about 1.5 years, in black. Why black? I was thinking heat absorption. In general, this is my nasty weather, mountaineering jacket, I have a less burly eVent jacket which I use for warmer climates.    Packing wise, it packs pretty small. I tend not to use a stuff sack, I prefer to just fold it. It is definitely not the smallest packing jacket, or maybe I'm just too chicken to crumple it up too tight. Normally I just stuff it directly in the backpack.    Fit wise, it runs a little large on me, which is perfect for layering. I've worn my Large size it with a Montbell down sweater and an Arcteryx gamma softshell under it. To put it in perspective, my eVent jacket in large can manage a single sweater underneath.    The jacket has no snow skirt; marmot does make a different model (Alpinist, I think?) with a snow skirt, but other than that, these two jackets are identical. I did not want or need a snow skirt.    As far as water and wind resistance, it's been bombproof. It's not super noisy, and it has a high quality, brushed feel to it almost.    Make no mistake, this is a technical piece. It has a helmet compatible hood and high pockets meant not to get in the way of a harness. On the other hand, it looks kinda ridiculous wearing it in a light rain in the city. Stick with something more functional and cheaper for city wear.
B008JH8JPE|5|Very happy to find this sleeper online.  My granddaughter grew faster than we anticipated and we only had up to 9 mos. sizes for her.  She is very happy and content with the bigger size sleeper.
B00J2HA5ZW|4|I LOVE THE COLORS AND THE FIT IS DECENT...THE MATERIAL IS THICKER THAN EXPECTED FOR THE PRICE.  PLENTY OF STRETCH, GREAT FOR THE BEACH
B0002TOZ00|5|Perfect and just what I needed.  Already have seen improvement in swelling, and my legs are feeling more dynamic, and ready for a good hike.  Great product.
B003E2ZO3E|5|This tank is great for layering.  I love the length and the rounded hem ... accentuates the figure nicely.
B004BIO8DW|2|I didn't know that t-shirt material could be this thin.  It's almost transparent.<br />It looks just like the picture and it's cool to where around fellow Bruce fans but I don't think it will last very long before it starts falling apart.
B00NIHNDI8|5|Super cute! Bought one for my daughter and niece for Christmas.
B00J5ETFW6|1|too big
B00LO6J2MQ|5|Beautiful dress I love it too. Runs small I needed to order 2 sizes larger
B0015AK3BA|2|well it looks nice and works well but try getting on and off your kid. i dont think my son has a big head but when we tried to getit on it was difficult. Getting it off was worse, the tie was too small. it should not be advertised for that age range...should of bought the next size up maybe, but he is only 2 1/2.
B00T7MZDR2|4|Nice would buy again if I needed too.
B003VH38J4|5|I waited a few extra days for the product to arrive but it is a really soft, thin, and lightweight top easily worn over my swim top or not. It dries quickly after getting wet and so far holds its shape. I think the price is in the softness.
B00JVN8FW2|5|I have this top in blue and black. It is very figure flattering but not too tight, swoop neck again is flattering but not too revealing. It can be casual or dressy and goes easily from day into night.
B00FWKU86Y|4|just all right
B00L5PI9E8|5|Very cute
B00BYOEGO2|3|Got it for my granddaughter and was too long..was a small adult,should of fit..<br />But am keeping it for a nite shirt she says
B00UXLK64Q|5|Great quality clips, got exactly what I wanted in a speedy fashion
B008YHF95W|5|Fit as expected
B00PYBB0UY|5|Fits perfect. Material is high quality.
B00MAX4TBG|2|My wife loves the shirt, however, it is the smallest large ever made!
B008LMUVUS|5|Looks and fits good. My son is 5 and weighs 43 pounds.
B0002KWZ4M|5|These Cuddi Duds keep me warm during the cold months.
B013CW1UZQ|5|Awesome shirt. super fast shipping, Great Price!
B00HH9KX9U|5|Great Product
B00ESCO45I|4|I bought this sweater for an ugly sweater party. Although it would be great for this purpose, I don't think it is SO ugly that it cannot be worn throughout the winter! The only reason I gave it a 4 star rating is that there is no care label on it!! Weird!
B0007CKNGC|5|For me, Wrangler jeans are the only way to go. I've tried most other brands, Lees, Levi's, Kings Court, and others, but I always come back to Wrangler. No other brands fits me as well. Feels as well. Stands up to wear as well. These things are like the old Timex Watch slogan, they take a licking and keep on kicking!!!
B005149STO|1|They LIE. its not 100% cotton. There's no cotton at all!
B005ZQR66K|5|works great for us
B00E5ZV78U|1|It is nothing like the picture.. it's see through and the material sucks. It's definitely not what I had expected.. I was extremely disappointed.
B009UQCSS2|4|Only issues it was a bit sticky on the inside from the screen print but nothing a quick wash couldn't fix.
B0013F6A3C|5|I gave this bra a 5 star rating.  Have had problems in the past with bras that don't fit and this one does.  It holds it shape as long as you don't put it in the dryer or wash it in hot water.
B005NKKKG6|3|I was so excited about these and the overall product quality is good especially for the price. I was disappointed that the picture led me to believe they would come up much higher on my arm and they did after some tugging, however the stretching took its toll and now they won't stay up so I constantly battle with tugging them back into place. If you're tall with long limbs I would browse around first before settling on a pair of these.
B00KN6OE44|3|color was slightly different than picture.<br />not sure if you can specifiy when ordering.
B00742VS3U|2|I got these training pans for my toddler, and am very disappointed. Even though the quality of the material and the fit are great, they simply don't provide enough padding to hold moisture. Whenever my baby has an accident wearing these training pants, we end up with a puddle on the floor or furniture.<br /><br />I also tried Potty Patty training pants, and what a difference! Everything stays inside and the pants are just a little moist on the outside.
B00T85GXYA|4|The t-shirt was great and it was delivered as promised. I liked the shirt a lot and I am also trying to raise pit bull awareness.
B0060ONTHG|5|I bought this outfit for my son to wear to his first trip to Sesame Place.  It was a huge hit.  It seemed that everyone there was wearing character clothes.  This outfit looked perfectly on him.  I liked that it wasn't commercialized but it was still casual and fun.  It has great colors and was a decent price.  It was also very convenient to get it online at the last minute!
B00GBASLTU|4|Got this for my husband for our up comming vaca ..the color is exactly like in the picture!! I really like the shirt its very light weight perfect for walks on the beach :-) he hanst tryed it on yet but im sure he will love it!
B00IAZQT48|5|Just perfect!
B007PESS5I|5|My 5 year old loves these. They fit exactly as expected. They have a cute Angry Bird theme. I couldn't find these at the store so I was pleased to find them on Amazon.
B00I0J1RNM|5|Love, love, LOVE!! This is my new favorite sweater Very good quality and looks different!  Love this will buy more in the future from this buyer! It is great!  Highly recommend!  I am 5'7&#34; average build got a little stomach and I got the US Large and it fits me perfect!
B00ID5NM0O|3|product match description and of decent quality.
B0058ZN482|5|Loved this dress and so did my daughter. I got this for a siblings wedding and it was a big hit. My daughter told me she felt so pretty in this and continues to want to wear it even after it is too small :) It is lovely and well made and because it is cotton, it can be dressed up or down depending on the accessories etc.
B00MJSCJHS|2|The lenses are slightly warped and dark, hurting our eyes and causing headaches
B00N7B29RG|5|Well, i really liked it, but my girlfriend thought it was too bulky and long, so I had to take it back and she's buying a different one. :(
B00J2WIFIQ|5|I bought the orange one, and it is gorgeous! It came in a lovely box and with a cleaning cloth. It will take some getting used to, but I like having 2 zippered pockets, and plenty of room for credit cards, store cards, insurance cards, etc. I think it would be better if the zippers were put more in place instead of dangling, but this really isn't an issue. This is exactly what I've been looking for for a very long time. It will work well as a small clutch too. Very classy. The gold tone hardware makes it look extra classy.
B000SRPNBQ|5|Got the size small for my 12-year-old nephew, but it looks small, so I gave it to my own 12-year-old son, who is smaller than my nephew.  He is a HUGE Star Wars fan.  He loves this t-shirt.  His friends thought it was cool too.  You might consider going up a size.  This is a traditional cut t-shirt (not the newer slim-cut) made out of traditional t-shirt material (not the newer thinner fabric.)
B00U2EYPCS|5|Love this bathing suit so cute and colorful and flattering will be purchasing another!!(;
B008VUNWZ6|1|They are prewashed and washed appropriately, and of all the brands, i was sure this would be my favorite.  they just LOOKED like they would fit the best.  but they fit the worst.  They have leaked everytime and I am giving up on them.  my thirsties AIO are the best, both snap and velcro.
B0091MC966|5|Perfect! Very satisfied with this dress.
B00GTABQZS|1|Size 5 was to small for my child who wears size 5 clothes... Have to return it.
B005FHKJA4|5|I got this item to send as gifts to some of my girl friends in Europe, where I have been living for the past six months. Everyone loved this t shirt since it goes so well with jeans. The design is colorful and timeless. For ture blue fans of american culture only.
B00O80N2C6|2|Very cheaply made. I doubt they will hold up to washing. The hems are unraveling straight from the package. I would have sent them back, but he was too excited about them. So I'm sure I'll be having to replace them soon.
B002GHC56C|5|This jacket fits well and does a great job of keeping out the cold.  It doesn't look like it would keep water out, but I've worn it skiing several times and it kept me dry all day.  Carhatts run very big though, I'm a 6' 165 lb male and the Small fits comfortably.  Would definitely recommend
B000MXB1X0|3|I wanted a bra that would be comfortable for around the house.. Unfortunately this one had a lot of support,yet i wouldn't be able to wear a T-shirt and go out in it. I genuinely love Bali bras it just wasn't what I was looking for. To restricting for home and to revealing for going out. Other than that it is a very well made product.
B007C5M5P4|5|Looked at several items before purchasing this, the splash of color kept bringing me back to this....love it!! Quality is great.
B0094R0CTO|4|i love this top. I am only 5'3 and 120lbs, size small fits perfect, i think that for taller girls this might be a bit short , consider that the top has a very loose fit and if you order a size medium or so it might be longer but also wider, my sister is very skinny and taller and but this top looks like a belly shirt on her :p
B00JGH6YDU|1|I ordered the suit for a 4yo 40lb tall, skinny girl and it's super tight with no stretch.
B00B15FPCQ|4|While this shirt is a bit small, I usually wear a small and the medium fits, it's still a great shirt. As long as you get the right size like maybe a size up as I did then I don't think you would have any problems. It's made well and very cute
B00T36YM2Y|5|Good
B0050AFXC0|3|They shrink alot in the wash.  I wash on cold and dry on Low.  But I bought them big so they fit ok.
B000IOIXL6|4|Very good quality material, just fits way too big. I read the many reviews that said the shirts were big, so I ordered a size down. I got a medium and the shirt is like a large, almost an XL. Nonetheless, it's a good quality shirt, good for work.
B001Q272H0|5|I wasn't sure what I could expect quality-wise for this kind of money, and was pleasantly suprised when I received this coat.  It is beautiful and everything about it perfect, stitching, color, fabric, etc.  I am very glad I made this purchase.
B00M0RJI7C|5|Perfect fit and colors. The white shirt isn't see through either!
B00HESUB4Q|5|They are a little tighter than I expected, but they are stretchy and ended up looking great. I love the waist size/fit/height!
B0030FTO1S|5|The JM SKinz line is fantastic. The fit and construction is top notch. I fin them true to size and wear well. The thong feels great, just enough material to make it comfortable for all day wearing. You will not be disappointed. The fact that they now have more than black & white is great. I have at least 10 pair, and I love them.
B0052SG71G|5|My Boyfriend loves his Birthday gift.  He's already asking me for more colors.  I will definitely shop for more at a later date
B00976RZVU|5|Wonderful spring set for my child. Comfortable material and very convenient style.<br />Very much it is pleasant to the child
B005VP2ZL6|5|I love my G Star!!!  An Excellent purchase....  When it first arrived, I was not sure I would keep it.  The material the jacket is made of is a bit eccentric, (raw denim) but it works, once I tried on the coat  -- I was in love...  It is extremely stylish, warm and without that bulky look.  I highly recommend G Star, to the next shopper, who does not want to wear a jacket mirrored by everyone else.  [[ASIN:B005VP2ZL6 G-star Women's Nordic Whistler Coat]]
B00CJ11CDM|5|I really love the shirt, and it fits fine. I'm always getting compliments on it, and people are always asking where I got it. It's nice to know people have similar views as me. Oh, I forgot to mention that I'll be purchasing a few more in the near future, different colors, of course.
B00B1FCQIM|5|I love it
B001DB14NM|5|I love them. Do you want to give me another pair for free? Ha ha ha. they're great. Thank you.
B007WA24WI|3|I picked this one out of 5 dresses that caught my eye, but when i got it, i was not all that impressed. It had a smell to it, but i will give it the benefit of the doubt and say it was because of the long journey it had in a small package. It was a little big on me, I could have used a smaller size. But for $10, i knew what i was getting when i hit the \\"submit order\\" button.
B00JZ5Q9C4|5|Looks good, arrived quickly
B002N3AMCS|4|i am really happy with this bee costume, I just got it today and it is very cute and comfortable and I am 5 8 and 192 lbs and it fits just fine but there is a few minor problems the first one is the head piece its really cheap quality and the antennas are made out od pipe cleaners so I am just going to go to target or whatever and get a pair a antennas and the second problem is the stinger is a little bent but over all I am very happy with this product and it is absolutely worth the price well I got it for $15, I hope this is helpful
B008E99JA6|4|Based on prior reviews I was unsure what I was getting myself into. This ended up being a labor intensive project but it had very rewarding results. I estimate I spent around 15-20 hours for the assembly of the headdress. The directions were by no means impossible and my project was not perfect but still turned out looking great. I really enjoyed making it and the time I put makes it more meaningful when I wear it around. If you are merely looking for a costume accessory and won't use this very often then this probably isn't for you. However if you are looking for an authentic looking piece of apparel and are willing to put in the time and effort  it takes for assembly I would highly recommend it. It did require some additional materials and I ended up using some of my own thread, needles, exacto knife, and craft glue. The average person may not enjoy making this. It required lots of sewing and knot tying. As someone who enjoys crafting it was right up my alley and the price savings compared to already assembled headdress was well worth it for me.
B004J723U0|4|I purchased this item for my daughter who loves monkeys!  I had seen it at the mall for almost $40!  The hat that I received was the exact hat I had seen in the mall but was much less!  An excellent value and a wonderful, fun hat!
B00N3GTTOG|4|5/5 glove, way too small despite being an extra large (usually x-large fits perfectly)
B00T6FEIOE|5|Excellent quality. Thank you.
B00OW1KW6U|4|Very cute and functional. My kiddo likes his new shirt.
B005BVW5M4|4|The Darron is a great hat, much better than an umbrella. It is very stylish and comfortable. A little expensive, but worth the money.
B00A42J8L6|2|I wanted to like this for so many reasons but it rides up on the thighs... almost rolls up... so no bueno.
B00LTEOY30|3|ridiculously small and knowing that i ordered an appropriate size; still it is for an emaciated person, smaller than an extra small, and i ordered a size large. it's cute, worth the cost, but can't fit an an adult!!
B00D09GOOY|3|This shirt is kind of ugly.  But every time I wear it, everywhere I go, everybody is complimenting my shirt. Wierd huh?  I like compliments, so I guess I will have to keep wearing it. *shrug*
B0048BRTZQ|2|The helmet sent to me is not the helmet in the picture. There are no buckles in the chin strap so its not adjustable. Just an elastic strap. The helmet is not cloth covered as advertised. It is completely plastic. Its just falsely advertised as a completsly different helmet.
B00GX173JG|5|Excellent quality.
B00B1EU9JQ|4|My daughter has had these jeans for about a month; she was pulling them up and the belt loop ripped. Hate it when this Happens.
B00EOYKEEA|5|This is a great wallet. It fits my pocket perfectly.
B0017W1XCO|5|Ordered one for after my BA and I love it, so much that I bought another one.  Soft, comfortable, adjustable, supportive....etc. I wear it 24/7 per surgeons orders and I have no problems with it, made with great quality.  Make sure to buy a couple of them so you always have one while the other is in the wash. Happy healing!
B00AMPXWSU|4|really comfortable. I wear these mostly to rehearsal or any performance. light, not too heavy and not too bulky
B00HNNNM2K|4|Skateboy liked it.
B00RMAVFAU|5|I don't get the bad reviews on these socks. I absolute adore them. I'm a 5'3 female and they fit perfect. Stretchy and just right.
B00NK7VWHK|2|Delivered on time.<br />But holes in them
B000MXB1SA|4|Service was fast and efficient. Bras or OK - not quite what I remembered, but satisfactory nevertheless.
B00OF9PUY8|4|I got a medium cause they said that was proper sizing(im a 7) and it was to big. So if your a 7 1/2 or smaller get a small
B00AZGWBLU|2|Washed once and it shrunk almost a complete size. Not worth the price and the color was not what I expected
B00BR4ZCT2|5|I couldn't find a v-neck anywhere in late April for my husband. This sweater fit perfectly and is a lovely soft weave. It was perfect.
B004S0KRVA|5|I'm about 5'11 and I'm in between a medium and large build, so finding something that fits just right has been a bit hard, especially ordering on the web. I looked at the measurements and the decided on the large, and to my surprise, it fits pretty nicely. The only complaints I have are that the waist area is a bit too wide, and the sleeves are about an inch too long, but I'm not worried since it'll give me more space to bundle up for the really cold days. Definitely would recommend this item!
B0034Z1BO2|2|I tried this product in the M/L size and found that it narrowed/curled up as other reviewers have stated.  I got around this by 'wrinkling' the part of the belt that has the sharp hook portion of the 'hook and loop' system such that the edges were flush with the edges of the softer portion of the belt, but did not lay flat against the soft portion of the belt.  In this way, I was able to 'save' my skin and clothing from the sharp hooks.  I think this curling/narrowing is a design flaw.  In a last ditch effort, I decided to buy the smaller XS/S belt, thinking I wouldn't need to tighten it as much as the M/L to get results.  The smaller belt arrived when I was around 6 weeks post-partum and curled/narrowed not long after (within 2 days).  Honestly, I'm not sure if the product has had a narrowing effect on my hips or not.  My belly is more of an issue with my pre-pregnancy pants than my hips.
B00JM52DZ4|5|Perfect for newborn
B00606NHJ4|5|This item was purchased for a co-worker and  he has received nothing but positive compliments and wanted to know how they can acquire one as well.<br /><br />This item is very good material, lite weight but warm.  Get for cool to medium cold weather.
B00F6MPOTO|5|Great Value!
B00G7OSVY0|2|For one... this isn't equivalent to a men's medium. More like a men's small. A men's medium is what I'd consider a general one size fits all when it comes to hoodies at least. Not really a hoodie, as it has no hood. I don't care about that. But it's more like a thick odd fabric long sleeve tee. I wouldn't call it a hoodie. It's a strange material. Almost like something you would expect to be fleece lined but it's not. Reminds me of the material barbie clothes are made out of. Took an absolute eternity to come. I ordered this over a month ago. To me.. it shouldn't matter what the shipping says... it really doesn't take that long to process an order and send it from hong kong. I always anticipate the decade long estimated shipping to simply cover their ass a little but it REALLY took over a month. Like 6 weeks. It takes 2 weeks max to ship something via the slowest shipping available from hong kong. so just s***ty slow service. It's a nice print but everything else is an issue. Who knows what this stranger material will wash up or bleed like.
B006RA1LFA|5|an nice product to keep legs nice and warm, on many cold days and nights ahead her in the northland,  and a nicer than usual product
B00P5Q603A|4|This dress looks extremely nice on.
B0065L8OVK|5|Great shirt and delivered quick
B005CSNW4Q|5|These sweat pants are comfortable and well made. I definitely have no complaints for the price. I am 5ft 4 in and 120 pounds. I wear a women's 4 or a junior 7 in pants and the medium are perfect. They were a bit baggy at first but they will shrink in the dryer. They are great sweats for lounging around the house or walking the dog in the cooler weather.
B00LV3EXYE|5|Fit perfect!
B008727YHK|5|This was the most perfect Halloween outfit. Absolutely adorable and material kept little one warm!!!
B00IHDITUU|5|Love this, shipping was super fast and was exactly as described. A little big, but that's what I wanted, fits as a cute jersey-dress.
B00EUI44GO|4|I'd say that it's kind of true to size. I'm 5'2 and roughly 120 lbs and it's very tight on me but it hasn't ripped at all and my waist isn't COMPLETELY crushed. They're in very good condition, too. And I've worn them three times since purchasing.
B00BIHK75C|3|I bought a size 4 and it's way too big I will need to  take it to the dressmaker adjust. This wil be cheaper than returning as I live outside the us,
B0012QFEVG|5|Beautiful, fits perfectly!
B00LH63FEE|5|I work at an 80's themed bar & this shirt got great reviews.  Comfortable fit for running around all night!
B00JM0X8R6|3|Very small and flimsy, I am a size 8 and it was small.
B00KKFLCUC|5|I like these socks, so far....Love the colors, do not slip off heel, has silicone in back.
B0085IGPBW|3|Ordered a 36x32 and the label says 36x32 but the actual measurements are more like 36x36. Tried shrinking them by washing in hot water and drying on high heat but I will still have to have them hemmed. Try these on before you buy.
B00BCPA714|2|These may be low rise for Erkel, that's about it.  They just don't feel good on.  They are too hot for working out.  I looked forward to their arrival for 19 days and was disappointed when they finally got here
B012AUAY12|1|****FAKE AND KNOCK OFF ITEM****<br /><br />This model and this dress are EXCLUSIVE to THE PINK LILY BOUTIQUE.<br /><br />Anything you buy here should be bought at your own risk. I personally own Pink Lily Boutique items and they are amazing and gorgeous quality pieces.<br /><br />Google their website and buy straight from them!
B001D53FV2|5|Gave as a gift for my grandson at Christmas. He loved them. He does a lot of outside work and these overalls are perfect for the cold climate we live in.

B000A8PNPE|1|The nightgown came apart at the seam on the first wearing. I have rarely received such poorly made clothing.
B00T8398EE|5|Thanks
B00C7IM0UQ|2|I am 5'7&#34; 167 and the shirt fit like a small. If you are a skinny person then you will probably like it. I couldn't lift my arms and I got a US Large. If I go to an XL I am worried that the shirt will be too long. I am getting my money back.
B00DY7UGM8|2|I think it's uncomfortable to kids！
B00TIABU16|5|I LOVE Caribbean Joe. Excellent quality cotton. Well designed. Fits beautifully. It's wonderful to find the brand on Amazon, since there isn't a Dillard's anywhere near me. I just bought the second color in this top. Awesome!
B00J9JTEDM|3|I have ordered a variety of socks from this company and this one style does not perform well.  They are fine wearing around the house without shoes but otherwise they are useless to me. They look and feel great, but I got them to wear, not to snuggle with.  My foot is a size 9.5 men's (USA).  They fit fine, but slip off.  I don't think it's a sizing issue.
B00MH4MUK0|3|This swimsuit is darling. I bought it for my daughter because I am old fashioned and insist on a one-piece suit for her (she's 14). That being said, it is cut to fit just barely above the bust line and given any resistance at all, it happily slips down ;). I'd recommend sizing at least one size up if you are long in the torso. Even with the straps on it sits low on the chest. The material is nice and thick though and the suit is cute. Just be aware the sizing!
B0084AWSBC|4|Love the warmth and fit. It will be perfect for mild winter days when a winter jacket is too heavy or great when layering.
B000IH8CDC|5|Excellent item 5 Star, really like it, fire proof and dry the hand all the time, I really like it
B001SICMXQ|5|These jeans are great!  I am not one to order pants online - especially jeans.  They fit great.  They are long enough (I am 5'9\\") and come up high enough to cover your undies without being \\"Mom\\" jeans.  They are flattering and because of the stretch in them, super comfortable to wear anywhere.  I think I am going to get another pair!
B00KBUN4BQ|5|love everything about this shirt, size, colors, as it is shown in Fig 5 stars definitely
B003WL5Z3G|5|Excellent product. Arrived on time.
B00JJORI3U|4|I'm 6'1&#34; and these scrub pants are plenty long enough! Usually a XLT fits a lil baggie but these are tighter on my thighs and rear end. The material is a little rough but nothing a couple good washing a with fabric softener won't fix. If ur use to Baggie scrubs I'd order a size bigger. I would order this brand again but bigger
B00VHGEU6G|1|The material is terrible. You can completely see through the entire jumpsuit. Ill be returning.
B008S21AYW|5|This scarf is lightweight and very comfortable to wear. The print is lovely too!
B009L2HWWW|4|For the price, it really fit the bill for my 3 year old. The colors are nice and it seems to be pretty durable.
B0070S5WEE|5|The shipping was quick and the shirt fits great. I ordered my true size and it fits great. The shirt is very soft. I have washed it once and have not had any color fade.
B005GQ0SWS|5|Love French toast. Perfect for girls.
B00K1B2OXY|5|Nice opaqueness, the control top really holds me in without being too tight. Heavier weight than my other tights. We've been having weather in the teens but they keep me warm without adding bulk.
B00180G8UC|4|This swim diaper worked as I expected it to. It was a little snug, but my son is very lanky, so he was able to wear it for quite a while. Would recommend.
B00O9UZTGM|5|Best socks ever! really comfortable and quality made. I highly recommend by a man who wears through socks like nobody's business!
B00LINCN9O|4|I had to remove the elastic strap because it was positioned in a wrong place - too low. Now I like the garment very much.
B0009NERJ8|5|super
B00KGDZM3Q|3|The hanging chain was broken when it arrived
B002AQRSQG|5|My husband is happy with the fit and the quality of the pants are great given the price. They wash nice as well.
B0036OS6M6|5|My husband is very happy with how the shorts look and feel.
B000FFTXUS|1|So all of my sunglasses broke within a months time. I love the rimless fashion and once I saw the items for this company I went gaga. I ordered 5 pairs of glasses (all different styles) and when I received them boy was I surprised!!! 2 out of the 5 items were broken and 2 of the remaining 3 were not the styles ordered. Not even close. Once I was able to speak to someone from the company about this they apologized and told me that some of the items I ordered were not available even though they are showing in stock on Amazon and on their company website. Talk about laziness when it comes to updating your inventory. So we went over a few different styles that were available and they sent out replacement glasses. I was ensured that they were sending out the items that were discussed over the phone. Well this evening I received my package and once again I received the incorrect items. At this point I am not even going to bother but I am livid. I will never order from this company again and if you are considering placing an order I would spend the extra money and go with someone else. I myself will make sure the next time I order sunglasses that I spend the extra money with a different company in hopes of actually receiving the items I ordered. Yeah the customer service is good and I did receive my replacements in a very timely manner, but I would have preferred the items I originally ordered. Maybe its just someone not paying attention in the warehouse, but whatever the case this is unacceptable!!!
B00J6823KW|5|I purchased this for my nephew and it was perfect in fit, color and quality.
B008OYA9XW|1|This chef jacket did not fit and sizing did not make sense - it was huge, and I ordered a small! Maybe it was just me...but maybe not.
B00BIZUE3O|3|They seem to run a little small - and I wash in cold water and hang to dry.  So keep that in mind!
B003OQUJAI|4|The material is very thin, almost \\"see thru\\" and not the normal thickness for Carhart.  However, I am currently working in the desert during mid summer and this T shirt is perfect for protection from the sun and helping to keep me cool.  It is 100% cotton and did not shrink much at all during a normal wash and dry.<br /><br />This T shirt might be good for those who want to cover their arms during warm weather, maybe to protect from over spray, fiberglass insulation and what not.<br /><br />I would never buy this T shirt for warmth or for layering during the cold months.
B003DQPV84|1|The dress was way too short. It is very cute and very casual, but considering I'm tall with long legs, it was too short.
B00CFQVL8M|1|Looked very cheap. Thin material. The ruffles at the neckline looked horrible. Returned.
B00CLVZSBC|3|I got these to wear in the house while visiting my girlfriend. They don't start to fall apart right after a couple of washes but you can tell they will not last 'til next Winter. It was ok for the price but next time I'll just get a pair of fuzzy slippers.
B00HMLT6NW|3|Kinda small but not terrible
B00CJJ6AYA|3|sewing spoils a five-star rating for this otherwise very nice glove. loose threads/not sewed as well as it should be.
B00L1QWDG6|4|Nice material, very comfortable pants.
B00NS2P5ZM|5|love it
B00F3CSTBW|3|The eye holes for this shirt look a lot smaller in person.  I used an old Samsung Galaxy Fascinate (S1) to glow as the eyes in this shirt.  This is a very light phone!  But the material for the shirt was so thin and stretchy the neck of the shirt started to stretch out from the extremely light weight of the phone.  Phones with an AMOLED screen will work best for this.  Each pixel in an AMOLED screen is it's own light source.  Meaning, if the pixel is black, battery isn't used.  On a standard LCD the back light lights the entire screen, using more battery.  Also helps to put the device in airplane made.  I got about 6 hours of eye animation with the Fascinate.  I also turned off the animation sounds.
B00S9NPR58|2|Initially it fit as expected, but then it shrunk.  The seller was very good about it, and gave us a refund.
B004OWMOHW|3|NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,, BUT THEY WILL DO.  WELL MADE THOUGH.  I EXPECTED THEM TO BE OF THICKER MATERIAL AND A LITTLE MORE LOOSE.
B008UHAF1O|4|This dress is soo cute. I got so many compliments on it. It's very classy and can be worn on many occassions and with many different accessories. The only problem I had was that it runs small. The material hugs the body and runs up the legs making it shorter than it should be. I realized that when I pulled the peplum middle section down to fit around my waist, that the skirt was perfect length. If I had ordered one size up, this might not have been an issue. The length really is not that big of a deal; however, I just prefer my skirts to be at most no shorter than an inch above the knee. The cutout is too cute, but because of the back being exposed, I definately would've liked a longer fit. The back of this dress is what makes this dress so unique. The skirt is like a pencil skirt with a hi-low ruffled skirt attached to the hem to give the back a classy tapered look. I have seen many peplum dresses and this style is the most elegant. The price is unbeatable. I priced a bebe peplum dress for well over $100. When they sold out of the one I wanted, Amazon suggested this one. The material is stretchy and thin which means you can see through it slightly. But, overall, this is a good peplum dress.
B00EZDDPOG|5|The material of these shorts are amazing. They have a soft feel and dry incredibly quickly. I wear a size 30, and these fit perfectly.
B00CUOYR2Q|5|Sometimes it is difficult to imagine how the item you bought though the internet is going to be really. But this handbag was much nicer than I expected. Everybody asks me where I bought it. Beautiful!
B00EJXUHQG|4|Very soft, flows nicely.  Color is very rich
B00HH5G7KS|5|I love this top. It's very comfortable & Nice lose top I had bought two diffrent colors. It's worth buying more.
B00A6SQMMG|4|i like this ideal very much just wish all the pocket are hidden inside don't want to look too obvious at the airport and it was too big for me ,also my friend said  i look like someone working at the airport .<br />i send it back ,it came with free return i am glad it does ..
B0029XFO9I|4|I just received an order for 5 pair total cost $10.57 per pair. I tried to duplicate the order and the price per pair was shown~~ at about 15 bucks a pair. n<br />no thanks I'll order wigwam socks somewhere else I don't get ripped off very easily
B002HWS7F4|5|Perfect
B001G890OM|5|Amazing pants, fit really good
B00EFBGDJ2|5|I had hope that it would have been big enough to wear a shirt (long-sleeve or short-sleeve) under it. But I can wear a bra under or a tank top. Unfortunately I can't button it w/o it pulling and u can tell it doesn't fit well. I need to send it back to the seller. I'm disappointed that it doesn't fit. As for the seller, they got it to me in record time and I give the seller top points bec it's not hheir fault that it doesn't fit well.
B001KNFWFY|5|Just a classic Christmas tie, and you need more than one Christmas tie or you end up wearing the same one all the time
B001H0QFKG|5|Good hat for a small head not as long as it looked. But overall I loved the hat and it was a reasonable price.
B00421BMM8|4|I love the material of this dress, very soft and comfortable however the material contains elastic so it clings to the body. If I could do it again, I would have ordered a Large, not a Medium. I didn't like the way the straps criss-crossed in the back, but luckily you can detach and put the straps on the normal way as well. Overall, it will be a comfy nightgown, but not one I would be likely to wear when company is around!
B00P76U77I|5|exactly what I was looking for
B0002Y8SEO|5|Awesome! Love it! I recommend this to everyone because it is awesome! It is a very cool item to have!
B00MZCMW48|5|These sports/basketball shorts are really very nice. They are a thick but breathable material. We purchased the grey ones and the color is very true to the color shown online. The size is exactly what they show online too. Very good quality material so I can see them lasting a nice long time. The waistband is comfortable and not the kind that digs into his skin when he wears these. My husband really likes the length too. All around great products.
B00H95UJPA|4|These are good but not the same quality as the pants from years ago. Fit remains the same but material is lighter weight and Ferrari decals are not as nice.
B006ZR4GWK|4|I love this dress. So comfortable and fits just right. I have a size 14 and it's perfect. Love the color and feel of the material. Only downfall is that the V neck has to be pinned or taped as the bra will show if it's not but that is no biggie. The price was awesome too.
B00B8KRCW0|5|My 3 year old loves this dress. Quality seems pretty good.
B00BJOZH7W|1|Hello I want to cancel
B006LHN0BW|2|Were not as long as advertised. Too short in length.
B00KWK39LA|3|I purchased these since I like knee socks.. but the top area is too tight for my skinny legs.. cuts off circulation.. the rest of the sock seems to be alright..
B004QJBQQI|5|This version of the same sock is much nicer than the previous one. The material is much smoother, the stretch is a bit better and it goes on your foot much easier.
B00JGHM2O0|4|My little Leah was really pleased with the dress.
B004OUXH20|2|Thin material. Bottoms did not fit as they had no stretch at all. The top busted wide open in 5 seconds. I can not rate the product all that bad because my wife has monster jugs that broke it open. 2 stars because it was still a good night.
B00QE6I0JM|5|Came a day early, it super comfortable and does exactly what I need for my cosplays. Was worried it would of been to big but it is the perfect fit! I hope to get another one if you get any more white US4-6 in!
B00480G7U0|4|I like all the pockets and it is not baggy. It gives me a shape without being too tight.
B009SFB1MO|5|This wallet is awesome I got it with a few reservations but when I got it I was happy with it. the pictures are a little off the sword are more visible in black and the leather is a little lighter but still a great wallet.  I would definitely buy from this seller again.
B00Q6SJF3I|3|the hat is ok
B00BSEV8MQ|5|Exactly what my husband was looking for.
B003VYCOWE|5|Fit my 38\\" waist area well with a large. I am 6' tall and rather long legged so they appear a tad short, but once the boots are on, they do not look dorky short. The insulation seems adequate when worn with a light long underwear. They may be able to go over pants, but I do not think that was the design intent.  The built- in gators are great.
B00PHSDA7A|5|Got the shirt todays its so soft and design is great ! I havent washed yet so i dont know if the design cracks but overall good shirt
B005BTGAC2|2|Wrist strips unsew, has to sew them back myself. Tip of fingers started unsewing after 3 uses. Leather quality not bad.
B00DQNCPCE|3|Nice shade of black, black.<br />They are not true to size though. Very small.<br />however, they look Great on as they have a design of<br />a rip look on front.<br />They are short!<br />I like them it's just I have find the right size...Not easy on this<br />item.<br />Fabric is thin but comfortable.
B0044AHOGA|4|These are exactly what I expected them to be. They fit perfectly and they were the right price. I don't expect them to last long but that's OK.
B004UPUFGA|4|The only problem i had with this costume was getting the hat/hood part to stay up instead of falling down into baby's eyes.<br /><br />It's breathtakingly adorable, and the 12-18 month size fit a baby who wears 18month clothes. It's a bit of a hassle to get into and out of, especially if you don't notice at first that there are snaps on the legs.
B008GTBB96|2|I ordered this skirt in a large and expected it to fit.  When I got it was so small I could not even get it on. It fit my friend so I gave it to her. Good quality but too small.
B002PBNSMO|3|It's okay; only worn it once or twice during Halloween or costume parties. The quality isn't great, but you get what you pay for.
B00FKNMQCM|5|Exactly what i was looking for!
B0050AFYQK|5|For a slim guy like me (6-1, 175#), these fit great, much better than the Hanes they replaced: supportive without being constricting, they don't t bunch up in the legs or crotch.  The waistband stretches easily and holds them up with just the right amount of elasticity, and feels like it'll last.  The fabric is sturdy but breathes well even when I'm working and sweating. A great price on a 7-pack.
B00BCQUFOM|4|Wife likes it
B00MH42TAQ|5|exactly what i wanted. a fun bag to organize our booked themed bay shower invites and plans.
B00KCXI2MI|5|Too Cute!
B00KAKOPOW|5|It's a great jacket, and looks cool with my Star Lord Mask. The company of the jacket was very nice. When my product was delay. They sent it express to me in Korea, and I got it in 3 day at no extra charge. Great jacket and the company was very nice and helpful. Going to be a great Halloween.
B00936Y22O|5|My granddaughter is nine years old and she just loved this adorable hat.  It is just fabulous and warm too.
B00HQ51FC4|4|I thought it would be longer with how large it was.
B00K00UCYY|5|this gown is sheer.  It is beautiful and very comfortable
B00F3YQE6W|4|Smaller than expected
B00W9OGAAE|5|It's perfect for after swimming as a little cover up and is very soft and comfy!  I purchased size 18 month for an 11 month old baby boy.  I recommend buying it in one size up.  It will be a go to little jacket for every summer occasion.  Thank you Burt's Bees!
B008G0LAFU|4|hooks don't quite line up, but I make em work.  Great value.
B00BJDLXQC|3|Great stretch fabric, very soft, washes well. I love the way it wrinkles across the hips and stomach, flattering in that regard. But the cowl neck is a little too high for me, I prefer a lower neckline.
B00D0ZG4P2|5|Love the coat. Excellent customer service and very fast shipping.  Thank you so much!
B00K026LAG|4|A little small, but stretchy so I can wear it anyway.
B0095G1T9G|5|This cap is so cute that it makes me excited to go to the gym to swim!  It does not keep my hair dry while swimming and I haven't yet tested it during water aerobics but it keeps it untangled.
B00BJORDQU|3|my wife liked it and of course that's all that counts, lol fit her perfectly and she loves the feel of the material
B002K6F59I|1|My nursing bra size is a 36C, so that's what I ordered, but this bra fits like a 38D. I ordered 3 other styles from Lamaze in my size and THEY ALL FIT BIG. So I recommend ordering one band and cup size DOWN. Unfortunately, they don't make a 34B. When I contacted their customer service directly they said, \\"We normally run true to size and have not really gotten complaints that our fit is on the larger scale...Therefore I don't really have product that I can send you to replace what you have. I wish there was a way we could help but I don't have a solution.\\" Very disappointing response from a customer service standpoint. I highly recommend Bravado's \\"Body Silk Seamless Nursing Bra\\" - well worth the investment for support and comfort!
B004GAL8IS|2|I ordered these after ordering a pack of 6 to 12months socks from the same company. The other ones turned too small after washing so I decided to buy these. My baby is 5months-old and she is not big baby at all but after washing these socks I am not able to use them. Will look for other socks that do not shrink that much after washing.
B0037WWWFO|5|Great pair of shorts I own two other pairs and love them all.
B003UK9VB6|4|These did a great job keeping my gloves together. The clasps will rust if you get them wet though and mark your gloves so beware.
B00BTO3IV4|5|If you are in good shape, ask one larger size. If no, at least two.
B00284B5OG|4|I really love that I can wear my own bra with this shaper......that is a big plus!  Overall this shaper did a good job.  It smoothed out my back and waist area very nicely in a form fitting dress.  The material is very durable and the stitching is well done.  It has snaps in the crotch for bathroom use but they weren't the easiest to use.  I prefer removing from the top when possible.  The only problem was that it cut into my legs and that was irritating after a few hours.  Maybe I need a larger size.  Overall, this does slim and shape, and that's what I wanted it to do!
B00JFYKZ5M|5|Great quality, but it's a little snug. If you're an adult small, go for the medium :)
B00PU050Z0|1|Cant even where it not a normal x large women size
B00J5MX1AK|4|My toddler has a big head and this fits well...runs a little large. Wide brim, tons of coverage. Dries quickly.
B00H21FXHK|2|I bought this for my 3 year old son but it's way to big. I think it's for a 5 year old foot. But the socks are cute.
B0028SSDFQ|5|Amazing fit and comfort. They are dreamed trousers. Perfect style to work. You don't need to fight ironing them. Long lasting.
B009MB28YY|5|Beautiful colors and very nice fabric! It's really a confortable dress!
B00C2LCE2C|4|Looks great but runs too big. I am 17 weeks pregnant and I now weigh 124lbs. The pants are so big , they will not even stay up. I should have bought XS.
B00IZLT9QW|4|Great maxi<br />get lots of compliments on it..<br /><br />But the sun is not your friend with this one. Need a slip otherwise your legs are totally visible.. Too me that is just tackywear. I live in Florida so sun is everywhere most of the time. I got a slip and now I can wear it knowing people are not staring at how obvious my legs are under a long skirt.... just not my thing.<br /><br />If you like the pattern of this skirt, get it.. Just get a long slip (which Underworks sells on Amazon)..
B009PZW9AU|5|Love berets in any color although I know the French male only wears navy;  glad to find the price; may even buy a couple others. Known for wearing them.  Love the ambiance; the quality is fine for my purpose.
B002A3HAOO|3|I ORDERED ANOTHER ONE XL  FROM LL BEAN  AND ITS GOT ROOM IN IT TO WEAR A T SHIRT UNDER NEITH  I SHOULD OF GOTTEN 2X  AXTUALLY  I TAKE A LARGE ... I KNOW IF I WASH THIS IT WILL PROBABLY SHRINK  AND I WONT BE ABLE TO WEAR IT AT ALL ........ I USUALLY DONT COMPLAIN BUT SOME ONE SHOULD KNOW
B00AAHBO26|2|You can't see clearly
B000FETDC2|2|it was a very nice halter. it, did though, cut into my neck which was very uncomfortable. i guess this was not for me
B008F9VOTY|5|Excellent belt!!
B000HTNO7U|2|This color is definitely brown and not just sheer black. I didn't like these at all!
B000W4WASE|5|Gloves were given as a Christmas gift.  Recipient loved them.  Item shipped promptly and arrived in plenty of time for Christmas - Would definitely order from this website again.  Thank you.
B007BZ67OU|5|Granddaughter loved them.  Somewhat hard finding them in stores during holiday season,
