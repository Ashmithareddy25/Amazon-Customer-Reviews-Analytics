B00X2TUW1I|5|Very happy with this purchase. Works great.
B005HH4VFQ|1|If you want to save yourself a lot of time and hassle skip on by this one and buy this well built cargo holder:  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001G4Z5J0?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o09_s00<br /><br />If you're bored, or like me, want to make sure you're getting the best product for the money with copious amount of research, read on.<br /><br />The litmus test for writing a good review on Amazon is:  would I recommend this to my family?  Absolutely NOT is the answer for this item.<br /><br />Pros:  Its inexpensive (classic you get what you pay for), it arrived on time, it arrived undamaged, its large compared to some of the other cargo holders.<br /><br />Cons:  Not as described - its only 23.5&#34; x 60.  Its cheaply constructed:  Welds were just tack welded and in a few places they simply forgot to weld it, &#34;powder coat&#34; was thin and came off in spots simply by putting it together.  The grate on the bottom was extremely thin, rattled terribly just carrying it around and there is no doubt it would bend and warp with any weight on it.  There was just a general sense of overall 'cheapness' about it.  Worst of all was the deflection or bowing that I encountered. With minimal pressure on  on side or especially one corner the the entire cargo holder would deform, deflect, bow, warp, twist, - whatever word you can think to describe something you don't wont when you're holding cargo on the back of your vehicle traveling at 70 MPH.  To put this in perspective, my 11 mo. old son who weighs 22lbs grabbed a corner on one side and was able to raise up the opposite side up by 3-4 inches.  Keep in mind this is while attached to the vehicle so it was like a teeter-totter is was actually bending that much from the weight/strength of a toddler.<br /><br />As a solution, I was going to cut a piece of 1/2&#34; plywood to fit into the bottom and counter sink some bolts through existing holes to add rigidity and prevent the cargo grate from bending.  Upon hearing my plan, my wife said, &#34;why don't you stop being cheap and just get a quality one.&#34;  I took her advice and returned this POS for one that functions as intended:  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001G4Z5J0?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o09_s00
B00NC8UEY4|5|these worked great an can open hood all the way with no problems.
B00M9NKT16|5|Works pretty damned good.  I bought a new one because I scratched my old one while cleaning it.  Don't use paper towels.  Zeiss cleaning cloths (in little packages, moistened with isopropyl alcohol) work quite well, and are inexpensive when purchased in large quantities.  It works for me, and I ride when it is just a little bit above freezing, as long as you ventilate.  It is much better than the smeary residue every &#34;anti-fog&#34; treatnent that I have tried.  Optically, it is quite nice, with no noticable distortion.
B003AVNX0K|2|Works very well. Easy install
B00BRYF706|5|It's a sparkplug
B00G95TKEC|5|Really good nice and clear highly recommended!
B008BL9MQ8|5|Good quality. Fast shipping.
B00802FHRQ|5|I bought these to change out my stock fog bulbs on my 07 G35 and wow was I amazed at the brightness. It's right up there in quality with my stock HID's. It was very easy to install. After 2 years the bulbs haven't failed yet.
B0009IK5SK|4|great
B000CNJ66E|5|Exactly what I needed to stop the heater from blasting in summer, since the proper vacuum operated valve is a questionable order.
B000C5SG54|5|Perfect
B00GHT7LQE|5|Perfect fit on 05 Hemi quad cab 4x4.  This will make for rapid fluid changes in the future. Dealing with stock pan create such a mess. I even used a vacuum pump and there was still a lot of fluid left in stock pan. With this pan simply remove drain bolt wait a few minutes and no more mess!!
B003C01DJC|5|worked perfect
B005ZI075A|3|Light kit was easy to install
B00CPSXPUW|5|Awesome quality! I love it :-)
B006X8BSZ4|1|Will this fit a 1990 c15oo grill n dose the top an bottom come together
B00MNN16GY|2|Lots of flavors. Not sure it's lasting
B00SLKSD32|5|Looks great easy to install
B00Q2DWSCM|5|fast delivery , product as described
B00QHHN3R2|4|Worked OK
B0009TCR8K|5|Just what I needed to level out my pop-up camper.  Prime is awesome for all my deliveries from Amazon.
B00QLKJ2BQ|5|Perfect fit.. Error Code Free... easy installation same as the original part. Will be buying the other side from you guys
B00TPZTG7O|4|Product is great! Matches my truck and grille perfectly. Seller missed postage by a couple dollars, which would have been no big deal had I been home to pay it. Had to spend the time to go pick it up on a day off.
B004YA13L2|5|I like it 5 stars
B00KC370SA|5|Love the product
B000SL4AA2|5|This tiny machine is incredible.  Has already gotten me out of a few jams!
B009Y7MJVS|5|I've been wasting my money on plastic clips with 3 suction cups for years!  Black plastic melted in one summer, white plastic broke after 2 summers when trying to remove it to transfer to a rental.  This has a simple metal design with one clear suction cup.  Easy to install, remove and it will most likely last for several years.
B00823FSRC|5|This was a great buy, thanks
B00M0CBV9U|5|Worked great for a family summer vacation!  With 7 people in one car and non-existent luggage space, the roofbag carrier was perfect!! I was nervous about it staying on the car while driving on the interstate but it was not a problem.  We followed the instructions for setup including using the pad underneath and it worked great even going 75-80 MPH.  We used it on an SUV with no rooftop racks.  I highly recommend the RoofBag carrier.  We also purchased the duffle bag set and the storage bag -- well worth it.  We packed up the three duffle bags and loaded them directly into the carrier -- very simple and easy!  Once unpacked, everything folded down into the storage bag.  I especially like the fact that it can be used on any car and doesn't require any special permanent attachments to the car.  I highly recommend getting the RoofBag for anyone needing room for traveling!
B00ZYWPPYK|1|sent it back..........
B00CFQ5GY2|5|not much to say, good cae, strong tool, everything you need for removing and installing a chain. would recommend
B000CAVE4O|5|Perfect fit for my son's 2001 Buick Century Custom 3.1L. Very easy job. Good quality and half the price of local stores.
B006E8CDCK|5|Just like OEM
B001BNHY7M|5|great
B000VPJWZ8|5|Love it
B002IV4KFA|4|looks good
B007SOSMHE|5|Just what I wanted.
B008K7ZIFW|5|As described, workd well for my Pontiac G6 also
B0036GGDKG|4|good tool, makes changing fork seals a breeze
B0033XXXG4|4|Great pair of jacks
B00WPHVS34|1|No comment
B00FEURNRY|5|It's a beaut!  Heavy duty, solid colors, a perfect fit.  Hope the wear factor is up to snuff also.
B00KQPOSQ6|5|Great product. Especially on our recent camping trip
B00T4USC4S|5|This was perfect on what I was looking for, perfect size!
B00BX8SHGM|5|Wasn't sure how it would look. But very glad I bought it. Very sharp looking and fits my new FORD F150 like a glove. Easy to install, only took me 30 minutes. Rolls up very nice. By far the best one I have seen. Well worth the money.
B00D9C2CDO|5|It's huge, durable, totally waterproof (heavy rain through 2 states tested), and cleans up quickly, too! I love the easy to zip heavy duty zipper with the fold-over Velcro cover! Kept bugs and rain from getting in. This ones a &#34;Keeper&#34;!!
B007QQRGM6|4|What I needed, good selection of fastners
B00QMWQK2M|4|These fit just fine.  They are a little thin, but for the price, they're great.  There is no hole in them to attach to the little hook on the floor of the car, but I haven't noticed them slipping around, so that's okay too.
B00Y195OR0|4|I spent a lot of time looking at mats for the cargo area on my Equinox Crossover vehicle.  I really liked the looks and the reviews of the cut to order mats that run in  the $100 plus range.  However, that price range was a little more than I felt I wanted to spend on that area of the vehicle. I found this mat on Amazon and felt that the information made it an interesting option. Plus, the price point was very reasonable.  I did order the mat and feel that the item is well worth the expense.  It is a heavy duty material that is still flexible. There was a slight roll to the mat when I removed it from the package so I left it to lay on the garage floor overnight in the hot Houston temperatures and  that fixed that problem. I put the mat in the cargo area so I could see how the precut lines lined up with the walls of the area.  It was then a simple matter to cut along the precut lines and the fit is very good. You will need a good pair of scissors, etc. to make the cuts.  Even has a slight lip to contain any spills.  I did seem to note a slight odor for a day or two but it is gone now. All in all I am very happy with the mat and have no problem with a recommendation to buy if you are in the market for a quality mat at the most reasonable price.
B008B865A2|5|Awesome product ,fast shipping !!!
B00D091YTO|2|The seats fit well but the color on the middle part is supposed to be black and white flowers.  It is actually a greenish tint, so we are displeased with the color of it.
B00TZC45BY|2|I had a lot of shipping problems with this product. I have only had it for like two weeks, and the elastic has completely broke on the cover. It just falls off my wheel every time I move it. I promise this product isn't worth almost $20.
B000QIVSX4|4|Crossbars worked on the Saturn Outlook which is a hard find.  Crossbars had some scuffing question if a return?  Still worked well.
B000CKGAV6|5|ok
B000CO65D0|5|Nice well built
B00CJCQDK8|5|Sturdy, secure and priced right.  We are using it for dirt bikes and motorcycles.  Even with the metal ratchets, this is perfectly designed to NOT scratch our prized toys.  Best tie downs ever purchased...and we have gone through a lot!
B006L79ITU|5|This has been lovingly placed on the Smartcar of one Romanian doctor.  It doesn't get much better than that.  Good quality, highly recommend.
B00JU6OCR2|5|I was able to instal it without any help. I only use it with a bike rack. So far, no complains.
B000SXCLIS|5|Worked perfectly out in SD.  It rained and hailed and bike stayed DRY!!!
B00M06871Q|4|Simple and stable.
B006EIG8C6|1|This switch came cross-threaded. In other words it is useless.  It couldn't screw into the threads.  I threw it away.
B00AEXFK2G|5|I bought these for the sole purpose of not getting a ticket when I have my doors off.  The vibration is pretty intense and they can be hard to see out of, but for the price you're paying and the better than expected quality, I'm really not complaining.<br /><br />Make sure to tighten them with a wrench to ensure they don't just blow backwards the second you start driving.
B00RFA6F52|5|Works well and isn't loud like other inverters I've owned.
B00VSAP9V6|5|Love it! Bought it for graduation!
B00Q7ACB90|4|good
B000E4PNC2|4|Product as described. Fit perfectly and looks nice. Thank you.
B00RD982MO|5|I used it in my car for cat urine odor that had gotten into the air vents. As far as I can tell, it does eliminate odor, not just mask it.
B00A8CL25M|5|The product arrived on time. Very satisfied with the order and product.
B001HT2MZO|5|Fits any 2006-present Harley Dyna models.  I have it on a 2015 Street Bob with the Mustang Wide Solo and it fit just fine. It comes with a different bolt (longer) and mounting bracket to add in where it locks in place to the rear of the solo seat but not one to bolt down the back so you will need your own.  Other than that quick install and adds much more comfort for the rider with extra lower back support.  Wish I'd have gotten this when I ordered the solo seat.
B000GVHJ1G|5|For the money they are great. The car is actually smoother and quieter. I was expecting more noise, vibration, and harshness, but that is not the case. The most noticeable difference to me is better traction under hard acceleration. No wheel hop. The car is more planted during turns as well. I have a 02 Z06 with 55,000 miles. The rubber bushings showed minimal wear. The job took me 4 days. I used a ball joint press to remove the bushings, I burned the rubber off the metal sleeves, and used a wire wheel to clean them. The rear lower control arms were tricky. The axle is in the way of removing the lower ball joint on the spindle. I cut about 1cm from an Allen wrench to slip in its hole then grabbed it with a thin pair of vice grips.  This job is not for the faint of heart.
B00IO39LQ4|3|One rear tail light had wiring that was bad....
B00TQZN8P4|5|great product.. perfect fit and easy installation.
B00I15C5IG|5|We used it for our coffee cups on a 500 plus mile trip to Colorado. It worked great.
B004AE3YRS|5|Came as advertised and fast.
B006TMRRLS|5|Arrived quickly and is identical to the OEM light sans the MINI logo.
B00YDE2SKO|5|Love how these stick and restick to windows.
B008XN7NUG|5|Good scanner and good Price
B000C9WLA6|5|Great filter as always. Fit perfect on my 92 3.0 toyota.
B000MDZLR2|5|well made
B001INN5MI|5|perfect!  Looks great.  Came well packaged and on time. Thanks
B008FCE8IA|4|Perfect fit for my vehicle. Comes with everything you need. Only 4 stars due to shipping taking longer than was promised.
B00V30J86I|1|It doesn't fit like I expected it to.<br />Does not fit like the one you see on t.v.
B000TYOF0I|5|Excellent product
B000EVYGQY|5|Does what it is supposed to do!
B000OCKIHE|5|Great tool.
B00YEJ3I02|5|Very easy to install! It's all plug-n-play and simple to hook up. You'll just have to cut out this brace behind the tail lights for them to fit because the housing is shaped different than the originals. It comes with a resistor to prevent the blinkers from flashing rapidly (because they're LEDs) which is awesome. So far no problems what so ever. They look great, work great, and the price is great! Highly recommend.
B002P8ID5Y|5|Perfect match!
B00UO5D8O6|5|This is white as description says. It went on easy and has stayed on well. It's the perfect size, I recommend it and am very happy with my purchase.. Looks great on my Jeep!
B00029JMXA|4|fancy addition to my vehicle
B004JC6E82|5|Yes, it is a little loose for the Tacoma, but you can modify it if you really needed to. The people who are writing bad reviews sound like they haven't really put any thought into making it fit. I just put a big zip tie underneath it and it was pretty tight when I put the lock on over it. THIS IS A THEFT DETERRENT!  if anyone wants your tailgate and had the time, they will get it no matter the circumstances. But I bought in to this knowing that. It is good to have when going out to a grocery store or away from home to prevent someone just taking off your tailgate because it can happen in a matter of seconds without the lock.
B000CKGAV6|4|Good light, good life, works as it should
B00KTIBY4Y|5|Awesome.
B00XQN40XG|5|When I got these HIDs in the mail I could tell that they were great quality upon installing them I was more than satisfied with the color they looked amazing on my projector headlights.
B003CJ927I|2|... but its my own fault.<br /><br />I guess I should have thought this through better, but the cigarette lighter circuit is off when the ignition is off, so this doesn't really work the way that I wanted it to.
B004TZNS3S|3|Adhesive on the back of the emblem came loose and emblem was lost.
B004ZF3GUM|1|JUNK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! no idea how it got so many good reviews. I'm a certified auto technician when the product got to my shop the wiring was junk so I rewired the hole thing finally got the dims to work. called customer service three times witch none of the spoke very good English they sent out a new wiring harness and still not working right DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! mine went in the trash after I paid for over night shipping. I had four more friends ready to buy some for there cars but after what I experienced I am not going to let anyone I know get these. don't make the mistake I made I should of listened to the few bad reviews
B00Q4O1HG2|2|Ordered a size 2. I am 5'5&#34; and 105lbs, usually a size 0-2, 25, or xs/s in bottoms. These leggings wouldn't fit me if I was 80lbs. In fact, unless you are 8 years old and 5'6&#34;, I don't see these fitting anyone. I tried my best to get them on, and eventually managed to get them just over the knee. Then I realized, nope, this will never work, and proceeded to take them off. That is when the panic sets in. I'm stuck. Like, stuck more than I have ever been stuck before. I should have taken it as a warning sign when I endured the immense struggle to simply get them over my ankles. I realize that I need help. Hubby just left to go get groceries. F**k. I look at the dog, wondering if things would be different if he had fingers. I sit here, waiting, typing this review. He gets home and rushes over to save me. I feel like the fat girl who keeps trying on too tight clothes, trying to avoid the plus size section of the store. Maybe I will return these and get a size 18. No seriously, the waist of these was the size of my remote control. And they weren't very stretchy. Id say they only streched about an inch wider. I did like them because they were cute and durable though. They definitely would have been better without the bunching around the knees, but, whatever. Maybe I'll update my review on my next pair.
B00P58S2I4|5|Nice wiring kit at a good price.
B0041CDOE2|5|installed this on my 05 roadglide,very easy install and love it.30 min was all it took.<br />I would recommend this to my friends.Thanks Cobra...
B000EVYGZA|5|I've used it to fix my dryer 3 times now.
B009FREAGO|5|Simple, cheap, and does what it says. This thing is very handy to have in your car.
B000COBC7O|3|It does not work with my car Mazda6. The surface is too hard to thru, however, amazon gave me refund without sending the item back.
B0041MTABS|5|Works great,Fit like it should, fit my gauges well
B0071PQFXS|3|buy OEM
B0066TGUKI|5|Great Tensioner... Has a NTN bearing.. helped correct a belt tracking issue that another brand was causing.
B004RCP49O|5|Good stuff! Used soapy water to smooth out the beads to form a factory appearance.
B010H0QV00|5|This cool little tool combines a lot of smaller tool into a single tool that fits easily in your glove box or console. I found the tire pressure readings to be accurate, and the light is actually useful for finding stuff in the dark. If you don't have a tire pressure gauge, this is a no brainer to buy because it is cheap, digital, and includes many tools. The only negative I could think of is the batteries. I wished it used the more popular AAA batteries instead of the small coin type batteries. Disclaimer: I received this product at no cost in exchange for a review.
B0090B7M2O|5|I used an otc Genesis for years that cost 3k and this scanner does pretty much everything the otc does (as far as a scanner not a scope or gas analyzer). I would recommend this to anyone
B00LL4CBCY|2|Worked great for a little while. The fit was a little wrong but I was able to bend it a little to make it fit. I went on a trip for a few days and it did not make it. It ended up snapping in half, my licence plate fell off into my chain, and it destroyed my blinkers. If you only ride a little I'd say it'd be okay to order but if you're into long rides don't get it.
B00BZR3NRO|1|doesn't fit on Tahoe 2015
B001EOV492|5|Looks great on the hitch. Can't wait to use it.
B00COYNWP0|2|Items have been installed properly in my car for about a month. I was super excited to receive these. They came in a timely manner, and appeared to be of quality material. However, they are now unraveling in an unsightly manner along the seams in both the passenger and driver seats. I drive a 2014 Ford Focus. I was hoping that these would last, but they appear to not be that well-built as they are already falling apart. Going to just leave them there for now until I can find a better set. The price is good, just not what I expected in quality.
B00B9F8J9O|5|fast shipping and quality part. fit my 2000 e320<br /><br />Great customer service.
B004HODPK2|1|Item came with several parts broken and missing will see if replacement is okay.
B00FV8SX9G|5|Works great and ties down good on our BMW 2013 R1200GSW aluminum panniers using ROK straps.  Went through some driving rain and everything stayed dry.
B00R5WPE34|5|Beats steel cable anytime!
B00V7NEPYG|5|I love these on my JK Unlimited . Very bright and awesome white color matches my Evo 2 headlights. Quality is on par with Speaker lights for a fraction of the price .<br />Quick delivery and great seller , would buy from them again !
B00132CG4M|3|Didn't work with my trailer and returned. Will buy from them again.
B00ICQI0HY|5|Works just like factory!
B00NF1QPLO|1|a pain to install, worked for a couple weeks....
B0058OJ6H6|1|sent this back
B00CKMWX4C|4|Item delivered on time, was as described
B001CEG90I|4|Fits in 2013 Toyota Highlander.  Has fewer ridges than OEM.  I can't tell the difference in the air flow though.
B00CRL2B02|4|The camera works like it should. Not the clearest picture though. The instructions are ok but could be better. Don't be scared to cut those tiny wires to flip the image or add the lines. It works just as the instructions say.
B0000AZ6DP|2|Mine came in non-threaded. Picture is deceiving.
B000TCHOOE|4|i am yet to install. will update when i do
B00736OY9W|1|Very cheap bad lights, ballast, and wiring. Would not buy.
B0022ZPA2Y|5|I installed ricor intiminators in my 2002 Sportster and they recommend switching to a 5wt oil. Always had good luck with maxima products and the same is true for this fork oil.
B00SMY5O4I|4|Works well with my Club Car Precident. The bracket makes the mirror stick out a little far, but I was able to bend and re-shape it. One nice wide mirror is better than those five panel ones.
B004W901CC|4|I have a 1988 GMC 1500 and they fit on it. there is a small gap between the light and bed. where u can see the top clip. And i had to put a few washers on the driver side to bring it out so it was flush with the bed. Overall im very happy. They look rad on my truck but its only been a week. Will update in time to tell how time and elements take there toll on them. For 42$ im xpecting problems soon....
B00GD9CQWM|5|Great product
B00NOKPPK8|5|Giving this five stars for now because it arrived on time and we'll packaged. I haven't installed it yet Because of time constraints. But  It appears to be well made and with the adjustable mount should work great on my rzr. Only suggestion is that instructions be included.
B00FDXWSFY|3|This did not fit on a 2008 crf 70f. i had to do ALOT of filing to make these adjusters fit.
B001VD5NPM|5|Easy to install, very bright. I have not had them in the water yet.
B001BB8JT6|2|they were blue, after a week of sun in California they're faded... not blue anymore
B0048IZVLS|5|Excellent, worked as swish clock. thank you.
B005OK2L94|5|Great HORN
B00HSRU4Y0|5|Love them
B00L4TF32G|5|Great stuff been using it for almost 30 years.  Equally impressed with the Amazon service
B00480J4I2|5|Great pricing...swift delivery and completely satisfied. Pricing at the Lexus dealer would have been 3 - 4 times the cost!
B00A4542H8|5|This wax is great. It is easy to remove. It truly does not leave any residue on plastic parts. It gives a deep shine that is streak free.
B005P7CJH0|5|Awsome
B007LIA8JM|5|So happy we bought two of these. They are comfortable on the hands and help relieve fatigue while driving.
B00IZR6FDG|5|I have a 2007 Hyundai Tucson GLS 2000cc LPG and work great
B008OYAIEM|5|works great
B00852684M|5|So easy  to put on.  Put them on out air tire  baby stoller.  Love them.
B0026PEM24|3|Cheap looking but does the job
B00KE8LR8M|4|Nice liner. However, the three pockets at the top (goes between the back seat and the cargo area) are not very deep (only about an inch deep). The bottom of the pockets do not rest on anything. As such, the liner will bend down if you put anything with some decent weight to it in the pocket.
B000OB1CKC|5|Worked great!!! Love to order from these folks!!!
B00MWULLP4|4|Arrived on time but I found 3 pieces that were broken. This wasn't a big deal since I got a 100. Great price and fit. G35 07
B001DXG7S2|5|Works great!
B00VAIQHW6|4|Good quality product, arrived on-time, and fit well.  Large inner pockets for your 'stuff', whatever that may be.  In retrospect, I should have ordered a vest with collar, but that 's on me not the manufacturer.  I'd recommend this vest for anybody interested.
B00BCRMA9Y|4|Awesome ! It's thin of course because, its so cheaply priced but either way it looks so nice in my car ! :p thank you! and honestly it came extremely early .Very fast shipping !
B00S6TKGS8|4|While not as versatile as the Nissan Cargo Max I originally had, this does the job of transporting things like groceries without having them roll around the trunk. I have not been able to find the Cargo Max for my 2001 Maxima, so this is a decent replacement.
B00G0KRHK0|4|4 would last probably two months? these run out real fast.
B0065HI9UA|3|These come with too small of an eyelet for attaching to marine battery and needed to crimp new bigger eyelets to them.
B004MDGUV4|5|Fits and works perfectly.
B000CC0HZ4|5|just what I wanted does the job you require it for.
B00062Z5R0|5|It works perfect, I used to connect the original wiring with my new MSD coil. It was installed on my cherokee laredo 1998.
B008CEU9K2|2|Doesn't work well at all for leather seats. Slide all around and are uncomfortable. I had to take them off. However, they are made very well. The backs of the bench seats are only straps though there's no back.
B00G9XA8QS|5|Great product, works really well
B01092I9LA|4|These look very good in my car.  The reason I gave it 4 stars is because I could not get the back seat back rest on.  The rest of the seat covers went on easily and look great.
B00BJNNNQU|5|It totally works for my vehicles.
B000S2U49W|3|Good replacement
B004ZF4RAK|5|so far the product has exceeded my expectations especially since it is using a small h1 bulb.  I did had a small electrical issue the day after i installed it.  my car kept turning off after its ignition.  my battery was only 5 days old so that wasnt the issue.  The following day everything worked perfectly.  Its been two weeks now and I'm really enjoying my lights. I wish I would have done this sooner!
B0029TQDLA|3|I was trying to replace the ones I had purchased years ago.  I took a chance...these are not the same..however very thin they are better than none at all.  If they fail..I will try again.  You must be careful in handling these because of how thin they are...however they maybe durable.  Only time will tell.
B00D47A68C|5|Fit perfectly
B001U8U3SK|5|Works great and installed perfectly.  Highly recommend.
B00TRA4YZQ|4|Doesn't fit exactly, but good enough
B0040CW2A0|2|Merchandise arrived damaged and incomplete.
B005VVZ738|5|Absolutely what I needed. Good factory Toyota part.Perfect fit
B000IZ5DOU|5|Unit was just as expected an OEM fuel pump.
B00O0A7X9M|5|Each pack comes with some sticky pads, and those are always a plus. One pack usually lasts me about 2-3 weeks, depending if I open my windows a lot.
B003YJJHI0|4|Well made and reduces pressure as advertised. These come in other pressure ratings and I have two. Cheaper than getting one with an adjustable pressure rating.
B008A5WN2U|5|I had this on my old car and loved it so much I got another one for my new car
B000C33MI2|5|Works well.
B00BN5XV0M|5|Really tight fit but everything feels quality about it
B00P9WLADK|5|Great ramp. Great company to do business with!
B00H8DFKS4|5|They look great. Everything lights up crystal bright.  Very very happy with them . I didn't use the tail light (reverse).  I already put ijdmtoy super bright reverse lights in them
B003B44C6U|5|This bag was perfect for what we needed. It had plenty of space for multiple pieces of luggage, it was durable, and very easy to use. I used it with my minivan, with no roof racks, and it worked perfectly.
B00JJX1V9I|5|Perfect fit!
B00G0P0I60|5|Fit great
B000OR18BE|5|Large enough for 40 gallon waste tank of rv. Rolls easy on sand though it does take a little effort when full (use a lawn tractor).<br />May be high to drain some campers. Easy to dump. Need to vent when filling and dumping so use the indicator so as not to over fill<br />when venting. Sturdy and well made. Timely shipping, Would buy again from seller.
B00DCXC9AQ|5|Battery was shockingly lightweight and sturdy.  I have never heard my starter motor on my SV650 fire so hard and start the motor so fast.  Test lights on top are accurate and battery came fully charged.  I bought a very cheap lead acid battery from china a few weeks ago and surprisingly enough it couldn't start my bike, even after being charged all night.  Lithium Ion will not fail you!  Barely any parasitic drain over time.  Great battery and would recommend to anyone looking for a quality motorcycle battery.
B00EIBEXL4|4|Great product, but the fit can be difficult.  I have used them for commuting (no rain) between 3 & 5 times a week over the last year. Once at work, I wear them all day.  I updated the insole the first week for a better fit.  They work great and aside from the Coretech reflective heel tab falling off, they have held up just fine. There is abrasion damage to the left top where the shifter hits, but other than that the sole has held up as has all the stitching.  Even after a year, they are still stiff, which depending on your point of view is either reassuring or annoying.
B00COOBRMK|5|easy to install and looks good and when the kids are putting sports gear in the trunk it is functional.
B006QH560A|5|I just picked it up yesterday 08 10 2015 and it was only 1/2 charged ! NO BIGGIE. I'm a car 'nut' with 28 classic/muscle cars. I just hooked it to my new battery charger with the &#34;AGM&#34; setting.  Charged it to full in about 2 hours. Continued to trickle charge it overnight.<br />I'm sure this battery will fit the 2002 z28 SS Camaro, the C-10 454 pickup truck, the '88 Mustang. (I can't drive all cars at once, so we just swap in the HOT battery into the next car we're gonna drive. (Using marine type wing nut terminals)<br />LOVE IT<br />(haven't even put it in the C-10 to test it out--but I am sure it's OK)<br />P.S. Just as an aside, if it gets bad / defective within the warranty period....WHAT do I do with it? Shipping it back is not allowed, I believe. Please let me know for my peace of mind--what do I do if it goes bad in warranty period? Who do I take it to for exchange/replacement.<br />captaindandandan@Gmail.com
B007ZU4GE4|4|👍🏼
B003BZR7KM|5|Product does exactly what it should have had this on my tires for 3 months now and still looks great!
B00QQYXI1C|5|Very good product
B00KJ8L7B4|5|Excellent product, plug and play no soldering required. Installed these in my stock fog lights on my Mazda rx8. Installed in less than an hour. Hardest part was getting to my fog lights. The ballast is incredibly small, about 2x3&#34;. Because of that it's easy to find a spot for it. And it comes with a mounting bracket. I just used existing holes to mount them behind my oil coolers. The lights are bright, really bright. The color is perfect, not too blue. They almost match my stock HID headlights perfectly. They are actually slightly brighter than my stock HID headlights. Great product. Well designed. And easy, really easy to install. Highly recommended. And you can't beat the price.
B00EDQ2D0C|4|Work well!
B003FKNAGS|2|does't work with my goggles
B00ODCT4W6|5|worked perfectly
B0014JN68O|1|I should have listened to what others had said about regulating the temperature.  I received this yesterday, today I plugged in the propane so I could burn off any residue on the burner.  It got up to 700 degrees with no problem but when I turned it to Low it would not go below 400 degrees and I'll be darned if I'll go through contortions to make it work.<br /><br />Yep, it's going back NOW!!
B004C6EKOK|5|works perfectly.
B00K69GEQY|2|Difficult to set and temp is in Celsius.
B00651CLCS|3|Works ok reception not as good fm and am is poor but looks much better than original
B00HUBXBBM|5|Firm cushion, does it's job for me to be higher when I'm driving.  The price is very reasonable for the cushion and I hope that it will last for a very long time.
B004JKEWZG|5|Didn't fit my bike, but it's a great piece of equipment.
B003RVKYZU|5|Instructions included were wrong, but they were easily found in my manual for my 2003 Ford explorer.  Product works great and quality feels like it is as good as original one from the dealership.
B004A6BUWW|4|These pads come with all new clips and springs.  Unlike most all other pads these come with all new hardware.  I turned the rotors and am in in the break in period.  The pads appear to work as well as the OEM equipment but need to fully ware in first.
B004SZFCPG|5|Mic works great thank you
B00BLZ65BG|5|Received in a timely fashion and it worked out very good.
B006X8AVKW|5|Looks great no rust.
B000GZJ2GM|5|Good horn for motorcycles.
B0072KC0HM|3|Very unhappy bullet holes was not even puched out !!!.
B00UNTU3VO|5|very full and does a terrific job keeping the car dust free.  with the water shortage in ca, avoids washing for extended periods.  great case to keep the duster neat and aids hanging close to the car.
B00S2096AK|5|simple but priceless
B00XV4W686|5|good quality
B000BNH0I6|5|installs very easy the relay wiring diagram was a little goofey..I followed a version from a website instead of the one that came in the package.  When wired using the diagram the relay was weird.
B000O0JQSS|5|Fit perfect.
B00E4VY9H6|1|This antenna works alright, its nothing near the stock one I had stolen off my car. Also, its been a month or two and the antenna went from black to orange! Wow! Junk.
B00SSFGDXW|5|This is the 5th item I have bought from ijdmtoy and everyone item has worked flawless and better than expected.  These Amber raptor lights are bright. But not over whelming. They look amazing.  Especially on my aftermarket grill .  Have had them for a month.  And I  love them. Would highly recommend them .
B00NLQSL38|5|They look great and fit good.
B00AWNVKTK|5|Great deal
B0031I1ZH0|1|Bought this to cover my son's Power Wheels. Fit fine, but after the first rain storm water got right through and got it wet. The material is very very thin. This is more of a camouflage cover than anything else. Not very practical.
B0023053U2|5|Was great. Thamks
B00RKLYNQ4|4|I like it very well and how it adds that additional custom touch to the front end of my 02 Ranger.
B004A37MW2|5|work just fine
B00FTNK274|1|These are NOT made of metal! They are the regular plastic pos ones that break.
B000CRO4IK|5|Just what I was looking for.
B00JH25QY2|4|Works great. Just took to long to get here.
B00M0443ZW|5|bright and long lasting
B005R0JMZC|5|Soon I got it , installed it right away in less than 30 min.<br />Im so glad that I had it day before vacation we took suv instead car.<br />It works very good easy installation i didnt see any diference between original and this one cheaper also.<br />Watched some videos on youtube.<br /> Thank u!
B001810SHA|5|For anyone having trouble, it comes with two cans. One with the UV dye and one without. It worked fine and nothing is leaking. I check every month or so with the UV light it comes with and would highly recommend!
B00CIAS8WW|5|Extremely fast shipping! They are brighter than my old HID's. Will definitely order again!
B007QWKPT6|5|The boat starts up and runs great now!
B00EKCZKVI|1|Did not include the mini emblem as shown in the picture and I have to push the open button multiple times to get the car unlocked.
B0002U2V1Y|5|Mothers makes awesome products have been using this product for years
B006P0WO26|5|This oil seems to to perform just as well as other synthetics. For the price you can't beat this.
B00HQRE40C|5|Cool
B00BEN36KS|4|fit my 2004 nissan titan SE perfectly, install took about 2 hours, my only gripe is that when i installed these with a new set of shocks my rear leaf springs, that may have been caused by an installation issue
B0000CBIK5|5|as descirbed
B00B7Z6W1S|4|good i guess
B0009NWQWI|1|Worst product ever purchased from Amazon. Did not hold shape when packed with 4 overnight bags....could not use it as described or instructed. Bottom sagged and could not get top straps and bottom straps tight to hold it in place. Had to use 6 bungee cords and strap the bag to top of car...then threw it away when we got to Florida (from Michigan).
B000CB3DKG|5|Exact fit for my geo metro convertible, fan woks when it should now!
B006BDWZTE|5|good price over dealership
B003XU6BBG|5|as stated
B000W0PMRE|5|Good product for locking our trailer up. Would recommend purchase.
B000IYP6EI|3|This was the part I needed, but after 1 year it broke, looks like I need to order another one!
B00EM5HDHC|5|Fast shipping!! Exactly as described!!!
B004I0MT16|5|Look fantastic on my Camaro. Much better than the foggy old ones!
B000H6QWWC|4|bought them for a friend, so I don't know  how long they will last, but they appear to be of good quality.
B00BITITKA|1|I couldn't use them
B003V9L05G|5|Works good. Remember to check what psi your system limits to.
B0033QNZZ0|5|offical fluid for the rickey bobby race team, jd and fu had this in there dodge as well, good replacement for dodge no bad issues,
B007HG7TFO|4|Using these parts to connect our camper propane to a hose to reach our grill. Fit what we needed
B00877SL2M|5|I used these in my license plate lights they are very bright.
B008F07OMO|5|Worked great
B002P8SXLI|5|Nice fit. Everything works.  No extra work or parts needed for complete installation.
B002FYFD74|4|Work well!
B000BZX8MQ|5|I installed the last fuel pump on my '69 Mopar 25 years ago, and this one went on just like the old one did.  Some designs don't need to change because they just work.  This is one of them.  No problems whatsoever.  Now I just need to drive the car so the diaphragm doesn't dry rot again.
B004J0X7UW|4|Does the job. Feels a bit cheaply made but good.
B00HH1AFS2|3|I have a note 3 with no case and its swimming in this case. I bought it for my Dyna Switchback and i dont feel the magnets are strong enough to keep it on this size gas tank.
B00OFU33PU|5|Incredibly convenient and I love that it can be tucked away when not in use.
B000NPNXOW|5|This works....
B0009JKGII|5|Works well, removes bugs like it says. Doesn't mess with your paint.
B005G5RFMK|5|Love it!  It looks and feels awesome.  Very glad I bought it.  Good deal on Amazon too.
B006GT2Y26|5|Runs good
B009Q0Y3HG|4|Inexpensive and easy to install.  Good fit for aftermarket replacement item.
B00ESVYXDC|5|My head sweats a lot, and the skull cap does  a great job of absorbing, so I stay comfortable.
B000O51VJ0|5|real good portable campfire.works great,and uses about one 1pound propane cylinder a nite
B00429YAA6|2|Had for two months and started ripping at seams
B0028OJAIY|5|I used this for a bolt that holds a lawn mower blade in place.  After replacing the blade no matter how tight I made the bolt it kept getting loose.  After adding some Loctite it never budged.
B000CISVUQ|4|2002 F250 original cap got brittle and broke. This fits, it's an inexpensive replacement so far so good. Will update if anything changes.
B003Y8NTFS|4|Seems well made. I'm a home owner not a mechanic so haven't used them yet.
B002OFVBIO|5|I bought this for my Toyota Rav4 2012 sport edition. I did install it myself, and it was easier than I thought'd it be. I was going to go to a friends and use his tools, unfortunately the rain prevented it (since he has no garage) so I ended up doing it with what I had...a tire iron....that's it, maybe a hammer somewhere. I put it in, exhaust side first. Everything went in smoothly. The other side, however, was giving me problems. The bolt holes were very very slightly misaligned. I tried every direction, but they didn't want to thread. It took some convincing, but I finally got it using the handle of my hammer, I managed to bend the hitch frame long enough to put the bolts through. Everything looks great! Can't even tell it's there when standing up and the receiver not installed.<br /><br />This towed a small trailer on an 18hr roundtrip drive. No problems whatsoever, and I didn't even torque it. Just got it as tight as I could. And in any case, the manual was all shredded so I was winging it. I love it, and I hope to never have to do it again.
B008N2T6VQ|5|Rotors are great. Came with a black coating on them that will hopefully resist rusting.
B00Y4NQ9RW|4|Looks good and works good, but it was a bit of work to get it installed on my 03 F-150. The description says that some models may have a different wiring harness than what the light was designed for. Mine just so happened to be one of them. It will still work for those but you'll have to do some cutting and rewiring to get it to work which wasn't too difficult. I'm glad they tell you that otherwise I would've sent it back. The other thing is, the back of the housing stretches further back than the factory one and I really had to push it to get it flush with the bulge on the window frame and get the screws in. Despite all of that, it was still well worth the money.
B00HYJPQRC|5|Great solid lock, easy to install.
B00RU9OS7U|3|Decent floor mats. They're a bit thin and flimsy and they don't fit quite as well as some others. They also require some trimming depending on the vehicle they're going in. However they are inexpensive and still do the job.
B00IVFS5WG|5|Works great with the Torgue app in my android phone.
B000HBM80M|5|A+
B00UMR23OW|1|I wish I could put ZERO stars... I returned once because 1 bulb broke in my headlight housing (and it's still there), when I got the replacements, one flashed and the other one was separating from the base once again.... CHEAPLY MADE, DOESN'T WORK GOOD Do not waste money or time!
B001DRJMZI|5|Fits jetta mk5 just fine.
B0051D3MP6|3|not what I expected
B001PYKLI6|5|fit exactly 1968 p30 van, great
B000DINKPQ|3|i cant remember purchasing this item
B0006Z9SQQ|3|It removes dirt and it smells decent. The problem is it leaves a small film on the console after I clean it
B00NIDNV5C|3|Good product for the price
B00KD5Z1QK|1|I bought these for my 2008 Ultra. What a waste of money. Bike ran terrible had to put stock plugs back in. Junk. Don't buy them.
B00CAY7YNK|5|Excellent product
B009PATSBI|5|Exact replacement for my 01 4Runner SR5 4WD. Had the check engine light and VSC TRAC lights come on usually after a fill up and topping off the gas tank to much for many years. Kinda hard to route houses back into underside. But got it done and no more dash warning lamps as of yet.
B005WXNFDY|3|It does the job. Have to handle it carefully as material is very light weight and tears easily.
B005OV480I|5|Easy instillation, car runs excellently no more service engine soon light.
B0068N2XWQ|5|Installed easily, fit perfectly, included a gasket for the oil filter cap. 2008 BMW 335i (N54 engine)
B003UY5I0K|3|Part fit no problem, shipping was good. The only complaint i,have is that,after installing the steering wheel is not centered. This is because the orientation of the shaft is NOT the same as the factory part. This is the reason i only give it 3 stars. Joints are also bare metal, I sprayed them with rustoleum before installing.
B00MIZT7OK|5|Thank you. I'm going to order another for me. I bought this one for my daughter. She loves it
B004JKF60G|5|Fixed my noisey Audi A4 steering pump. Stops air from forming in PS fluid.
B007ZCAUCE|5|I replaced both sides on my 2001 750il.
B00HS5RTGS|5|Brakes are great. Can't beat the price
B006TZRAT4|5|Good product it works well on my 98 Jeep Cherokee
B00TD0I352|5|Cute little sticker 👍🏼
B00CXK5JCE|5|Fits and looks good in my 2011 Sonata
B00Y6QO064|5|Just received it today and put it on the seat.  If you install it properly (you pretty much have to get those 2 round plastic holders between the seat crevice until you can put it securely deep inside the crevice) the seat cover will not move around.  The only inconvenience part is taking those plastic holders out of hard to reach crevice.
B00SUTHIVM|5|Exactly what I wanted.
B0049CGJAU|5|holds nice and does it job
B00XK43P1E|5|I love the reflective emergency light. It is perfect for first responder, fire fighters, ems ect.  I'm so glad to see this finally hit the market in the united states.
B000E4KO94|5|Worked like a tail light should
B000818Y0O|5|Good quality product.
B00CO2DF6S|5|Love the way my led lights make my car look at night
B00K2VA1V0|3|The picture looks a lot different than the actual product. The dimensions were correct...I knew it was a little small but the material is very weak and flimsy. Looks very cheap. I guess that's what you get for $10 though.
B006QH55YM|5|Ordered Saturday arrived Monday securely packaged. I purchased 2 of these to replace same batteries I purchased 10 years ago for my boat.  I never let them fully discharge and they lasted 10 years which is unheard of.  I hope I get similar service from the new batteries anything over 4 years is a miracle.
B000GU0MMU|5|Great extractor
B00PH5LG5Q|3|I used this once in my vehicle. It picked up all of the trash that I needed, but there was not much because I tend to keep my car very clean. However, the next time I attempted to use it, it would not turn on. I emailed the seller, but never received a response. I received this item at a discounted price in exchange for my unbiased review.
B00VGBF8CW|5|It's great also it looks good and does its job.
B00FYX2RF4|5|These seat covers are a very good product and they perfectly on my seats. Like the fact that the covers will be easy to remove for cleaning and will protect my seats.
B00062ZNXG|5|Looks great under my 2005 Silverados hood, truck runs a lot more smooth!
B007OSL3DY|5|Excellent product, great service
B001DN1L6K|4|Good antenna
B00M2AXBDY|5|This magnetic bar sticks a license plate like glue to any metallic surface.  Looking at the plate, it looks like it's screwed in like any other plate, so it doesn't invite theft of the plate.  It won't scratch the paint either.  I'm using mine to keep a seldom used utility trailer multi-year tag out of the salt air.  It lives stuck to the garage door most of the time and I just stick it to the trailer when I need to use it.  Works great!
B004S7Y5EI|5|Great product and.perfect customer service
B005L13NZM|5|Exactly what I expected.  Fits and stays under the lid without falling down.
B001PYS7PA|5|Perfect fit for the left rear drum of a Mazda b2600. The difference between this and the w37840 is that this one comes with the bleeding screw.
B00HR8FCDI|3|Look like refugees from a bunny farm.  Moderate protection.
B000BYIEPI|3|They are okay It is hard to get used to wearing them becuause I can see the perimeter of the the prescription insert frames
B0113IQ8IU|4|Awesome..
B00PEAU0L0|4|Good quality bulbs. Very bright
B0035R0TEC|5|Awsome.
B001A6JX5G|2|to thin
B005JPGTNI|5|Good quality and allows for smooth finish.
B00062YW3S|5|Works and looks great.  Installed in 79 cj5 with original strait 6.  Used the included temp sender w/out the included adapters.  Gauge looks very similar in style to the original voltmeter and oil pressure gauge.  Was able to use all existing wiring.  The green light covering matches the other dash lighting.  I'm very satisfied with this purchase.
B00B5ZMQDI|5|This was exactly what I needed. Everything worked perfectly and I'm back having A/C in my ride this summer. Thank you.
B000CO76OC|1|These did NOT fit in my 05 civic as they said they would. Not very happy.
B0105OR0FI|2|I ordered a 24000mah unit and received a 20000mah unit.  I am not really sure it is a 20000mah unit as the instruction manual say it is 10000mah. Manual needs significant work.  I have not used the unit yet so I can not attest to functionality.
B000ZB39A2|5|fits perfect and i would recommend it.
B00K2SL1PI|5|Product came in timely manner.  Comes with everything needed to complete job, wiring, lights, bulbs, instructions, and template to drill thru roof.  I have yet to complete the install.  Great OEM set of lights!  Would highly recommend to anyone who wants that &#34;Heavy Duty&#34;  look.  Putting these lights on a 2014 Ram 2500 CTD.
B00IIAFJ9Q|5|awesome
B00BDEP5ZM|5|Best wastes stuff on the market
B00BT1Z784|5|Direct fit, easy to install if old Vw 1 time use clamps are already off. If not buy 1 inch hose clams.
B009TRSSGS|4|No problems
B003OC5CHC|1|Poor quality
B006XKF7XQ|5|Great
B004N1MH1C|5|This bumper sticker is hilarious!! Its very easy to read at a good distance and makes everyone laugh who who has seen it. It has gotten so many laughs i cant use it at my job because it got too much attention and now the person who i wanted to use it on might know it was me.
B004IVGA0G|5|works like a charm
B004WJPN2A|5|Easy product to use with brake job
B00DNL05GW|5|Installed this in our fifth wheel.  I ran a heavy duty extension cord and plugged it to the shore cord (main power to the trailer) so that all the outlets in the trailer will be live with the inverter on. I installed a separate circuit breaker to turn off the converter (very important or you will kill your batteries fast) when I have the inverter on.  It reads your watt load and battery volts.  It is super quiet and the remote switch is a nice touch.  I installed that inside on the wall.
B0066SF6HM|4|Ended up GIVING this to the BMW repair man, as it was IMPOSSIBLE to install.
B0001UZUW2|5|I had one of these in college.  I saw it on Amazon and had to get another one.<br /><br />This works well on all types of bugs, including spiders and bees, but nothing bigger.<br /><br />Pros:<br />  Simple<br />  Durable<br />  Much more fun that an old fashioned fly swatter<br />  Effective at close range (the length of the string)<br /><br />Cons:<br />  Limited range, some flies see you coming<br />  Not effective in corners, on food, or flimsy surfaces.  You need to stalk your prey
B00ZPVE63Q|1|I don't like these at all they don't stick or hold on there crappy and to big. There also white I wanted clear which they should be and since there big they hold water even worse then my last. I feel like I wasted money on something that's not worth even 3$ wouldn't buy again.
B00KGIE0F2|5|perfect fit for 90 johnson
B00J3D9XLM|5|Looks great! Perfect fit!
B0041QIMRM|4|Installed on a 2014 Vaquero...very simple install. I installed it by myself and it took less than an hour.<br /><br />Service was great! Ordered exhaust late Saturday night and it was delivered on Tuesday - with free shipping and no Amazon prime.<br /><br />Exhaust sounds very good, but I feel that it just isn't loud enough. Wish they were just a bit louder when cruising down the highway.
B00JRE38EA|5|I bought a different brand no good I put D's they look very nice and work great
B000C2CG1W|5|bought these to use while replacing the heads on my 2000 GMC Jimmy. Matched the OEM ones exactly and so far I have no complaints.
B0040DVL6U|5|This mirror was a lot different than I expected, but I really enjoy using it.  You get a good view of your own head, backseat, and passenger, as well as all of your windows.  I think the part that really throws me off, is that you have to focus on it differently than your non-convex mirrors.  That said, it's very useful, and I'm getting used to it nicely.
B004YJTPK4|5|Perfect fit on my 2000 tundra
B0006IX7TW|2|really wish this came with an on-off switch
B00KTIUG5C|3|These work pretty good but I've noticed that the range is about half the distance of the factory fobs.
B00GBZDI98|3|Received without extrusions. It doesn't fit great.
B00V25V7G8|1|Not the right handles for my truck! But I made them work and had to drill new holes into my door so they will fit
B000B68V6I|5|As advertised, fast delivery
B00RZ3IURA|5|Great product! Greatly improves the appearance of my 2015 Genesis Sedan.
B004A1N12O|5|Fast delivery and as described, thanks.
B00SJTRXE0|5|Very happy with purchase for Victory CC. Bigger than they look in pic, goes great with bike, excellent sound, very deep.<br />These are not a mild pipe, fairly loud volume, but excellent sound, not raspy.
B00RW3E6J4|3|Mirrors are small and blurry cool looking that's about it had to purchase different bolts and nuts for my 2014 xl 1200t but looks cool
B00VAVMHPE|5|Great
B000E322MC|5|The product arrived on time. Very satisfied with the order and product.
B009CCGKS8|5|Did the job. My husband was happy!
B005NLQAHS|5|Works great with Torque. Used it on Fords, GM's, Jeeps no problems to pull codes.
B00OOOV566|5|Easy to install and fit was exact to my vehicle.
B00CQAOLL6|5|Perfect replacement, no issues. Great buy
B00032K4FG|5|I got it in good condition smoke looks very nice you can still see the plate very nice.
B00I9K30PA|5|I installed this replacement part in a few minutes and my console was back latching as good as new!
B006CCWAXK|5|Great price
B000C2SJYU|5|Bought it for my 1997 Prelude. Worked fine.
B00FYX2MV8|5|Very happy with this purchase
B0000AY69N|5|great item
B00AW17SNO|5|Worked out very well, nice solid conectors.
B001NYYREC|5|Fits neatly into the bumper and plugs directly in the wiring harness on my 2014 Silverado.
B006JFR0B2|4|I like it
B0024NSMBU|5|The lights arrived in excellent condition they were easy to install and look great.
B006GHFXX0|5|Fits fine.looks as it should
B00VH643H2|4|These are a nice set of multipurpose towels for the home. They are a little rough, but they're commercial grade towels, so that was expected. They are made to be durable and last a long time, as I'm sure these will. I like that they are white so that I can use bleach if they become stained. I've been using them in the kitchen to mop up spills and dry dishes.<br /><br />This product was provided at a discount by the seller in exchange for my honest review.
B00C7XYMEI|5|Easy to put on and works perfectly.
B00ZS9RWZE|5|Great merchandise and way to Make America Great Again. With or without the RNC.
B00BAZCQD8|2|I installed these in a pair of Hella 550 Fog Lights and drove through some back roads for about an hour and a half. The bulbs were still working when I turned the car off, but the next day one had already burned out. The second burned out only a few minutes after starting the car. I made sure that the globes were clean by wiping them with alcohol prior to installing.<br /><br />They didn't seem any more yellow than standard Hella halogens, and they also seem dim compared to 100w Hella bulbs. The only reason these got two stars was because of the price. Honestly though, they're pretty much worthless if they fail this quickly. Not really worth returning.
B00JGRAOTK|2|The red switch part broke off on the second ride. Now I have a pokey metal switch. I wonder if I could just get the red plastic part reshipped? I certainly do not want to rewire is all. Otherwise, the product is good and came with all of the needed connectors for it's ends. I chose to crimp and solder the ends on. The wires are slightly shorter than desired, but I was able to make it work. I'll update if the manufacturer takes care of their customers.<br />I am going to try to contact customer service to see if they can send another plastic switch piece to replace the broken one.
B00JG95P5Q|1|Tension Keys would not work on a 2500 HD, I damaged two torsion bar tensioning tools before I was tired of fooling with it.
B00X421N52|5|Great items, great material and fast shipping. love these! Fits prefect for a ruckus.
B009FRTO9C|5|Very good brake pads.  Low dust, longer ladting.
B003SG35SM|5|These seat covers and floor mtts look great.  My husband and teenage daughter installed them for me today after arriving.  They make the inside of my car look great with the grey interior and the black seat covers.  They are soft to sit on and the steering wheel cover will be especially nice in the cold weather.  I also love the seat belt covers.  This was a great purchase for the price.
B00NC70SA0|1|It was exactly what I was looking for.  It is solid and sharp with the transparent color<br /><br />UPDATE:  My original review was right after I received it.  Apparently, it is not weather-proof!  Something you'd kinda want in a such a product.  I can say this for sure... it is not &#34;powder coated&#34; in the typical sense.  it is more like a gel-coat over chrome  Take a look at the attached photo after just a half a year!<br /><br />STAY AWAY FROM THIS ITEM!!!
B007SKAKPU|5|works fantastic,  definitly a good tool to have in every car.  comes with a code book so you know what the codes mean.
B0001CMUV4|5|Did what I needed it to do.  Using with TowTuff Cargo Carrier and bike rack.  Good purchase!
B0067UE4GS|3|Works as expected.  No installation issues, except who wants to work on a car?  Most likely is the original manufacturer of the factory parts anyway.  Plus they're cheaper on Amazon.  *******Update 3-14-16 This lasted 14 months then failed.  No warranty.
B00L843CK2|5|Great lights worked good good buy
B0000AXNMO|5|Great product and will purchase again.
B00MQ1DKJY|5|I am totally satified with my purchase, it arrived on time & everything went well with the installation.
B001S7ZT5A|5|Simply amazing.  Had some sap and hard water marks that refused to come up, even after I clayed the windshield.  This stuff took them off in seconds.  Fantastic!
B001AMC9J2|5|Handle good easy to install
B00HV2KHLW|4|Fronts went easy and flawless.  This kit does not have longer sway bar links and you will need those to be 100% right.  The rear shock mounts were too narrow to go into the factory bolt holes so some ingenuity went into making them work.  Also, the rear track bar does not have a relocation bracket and it took LOTS of muscle to get it to move the 1 and 1/2 inches to go into place.  I don't know how correct that is but the Jeep drives straight.<br />Once completed, it looks good and works well.
B00LW6OBOM|1|Very unhappy.  These seat covers smell like gasoline.  I would never put them on my new Tahoe ....  I just wanted to protect my seats but I will not use them.  Very sorry I spent the money.  I will try to send them back. Hopefully I will get a refund.
B000VKTUD2|5|Great pricing and very fast delivery
B00EKV2RMO|5|It gave my pathfinder another look , people that c it don't believe it's a pathfinder. It's exceptional
B000EQTQGE|5|Great product
B007VLFBX2|5|as stated
B008UDJQCC|5|Great quality!
B00651C5SS|5|This is the second antenna I've bought. I really like that they instantly give my trucks a more sporty look and I've had no problems with reception while listening to the radio. This one went on a 2014 Dodge Ram R/T. The other one is on a 1994 Chevy C2500.
B000VKTUD2|4|VERY GOOD
B001P6GONU|5|I purchased this brief case as a gift for our Bishop, we also purchased the aluminum (silver) one. He absolutely loved it. It is spacious, opens and locks with ease and adds a professional look. The compartments are extremely useful and our Bishop loved both briefcases. They also arrived before the scheduled delivery date!!! We are more than satisified with these purchases.
B0085IJXCU|3|Not of the highest quality but it'll do,does the job.
B000GU1GS4|5|I love these pads for the price.  The OEM pads are so expensive that they're not worth the money.  The functionality of these pads are the same as the OEM pads.  I like them better because there are just two contact areas compared to the 4 smaller contact areas on the OEM pads.  I can buy three sets of these pads for the price of one set of OEM.  I would buy these pads a thousand times over.
B00R4V67BY|5|Arrived ahead of time and worked perfectly
B001JEIHAG|5|Great Product, as advertised.Very Comfortable.
B00I9F8W5S|5|Great product. Works well. Use your knee ONLY. Do not step on it.
B00IOES0YW|5|easy to install
B007WU6LC2|5|Exactly what I expected.
B005MKSFH8|1|Horrible product. It only works sometimes and there is no click so you have to tug at it to make sure it's secure. Sometimes I will use it and think it's in only to realize later that it is not secure. This is a total waste of money.
B000QDHENM|1|I bought this at an Ace Hardware store but it is so horrible I wanted to warn Amazon  people. Ridiculously difficult to figure out how to assemble the spout. I've spent probably 3 hours (2 different days) trying to get it to work. It's a GAS CAN--how can you screw this up?? Bad seal, I've lost about a quart to evaporation. It's sitting on the porch.<br /><br />Spent about 13 bucks but have given up and am now looking for an old-fashioned, NON-no-spill can. A COFFEE CAN with a lid would work better!
B005VYS0EI|4|a clamp is a clamp , these are made well with extra thick metal  good long lasting clamps
B00WOY33EA|5|Simple to install and cheapest way to fix a broke door cable
B003BZL9E2|5|seems to be good quality wire, twists well and doesnt break easy
B002S3Y0SU|5|good value for the money
B00F60TRLW|3|Followed the directions perfectly and I can still see the dent in my windshield. Not impressed. I'm sure it still improved the strength of the crack, but would prefer to not see anything there at all.
B003UHX5WU|4|Fits like a glove.  Still getting used to putting in and taking out.
B003PIPMZC|5|Great hitch!
B0071I2PPW|5|Fit great. Works well. Can't beat the price.
B007HCCNUY|5|fits great!  aired up in a heart beat. &#34;deflategate&#34; worked great as well
B00JJ6DN1O|5|Nice size.  Easy to read. Adhere well.
B009TW8FX4|5|Good quality stickers
B00XB28A8I|5|Great
B00D9C2CDO|5|Drove from NH to WA over a period of 7 days, 2 of which included torrential rain.  The bag performed perfectly!
B00KA0KSD4|5|It does not fit my tank perfectly because of the name plates on the sides but the magnets are so strong that it is no concern. I love it and use it often. For everyday storage and items that I take in and out every time I ride.
B004U885UK|3|I was very excited to get this one! I had seen something similar, if not the same thing, at Spencer Gifts a few years back, and I had been looking for it since they no longer carry it. This wolf keyring is very cool looking, though smaller than I was expecting. However, it broke in less than a year, so... disappointed over all. There was a poem on the back, but as I discarded it after it broke, I no longer remember what it said.
B006RUJ2D8|5|Easily took nine year old vinyl graphics off of fiberglass gelcoat.
B000C5UFK8|5|Quick delivery......OEM quality.....just what I expected. Love it !
B00DW4YP1G|5|No issues with the container.  Not the thickest material, but should hold up well.
B00HNFDOSK|4|The Medium is too small but its a good product
B004BCLBJM|5|It's been over a month since I installed the lights and they work excellent.
B00U0UWQ2A|5|Perfect!
B001UCCNI4|5|Easily programmed.  Same procedure as OEM.  Working great afters 10K
B002ZBWKAU|3|This unit shuts itself off repeatedly while in use, regardless of pressure setting. Takes 3 to 5 tries to restart. Sometimes the pressure setting feature doesn't work at all. I would hate to have to rely on this pump during a side of the road repair.
B008CE0LD2|5|Product as described. Fit on truck perfectly. Holds well. Used on a trip from FL to NC, held a ton of stuff, tied down of course...and covered with a tarp to protect luggage. Great price. Fast shipping. LOVE amazon!!!
B000IY8OBK|5|Works perfectly
B00ZJ8S2HG|5|These came in one day, total surprise!<br />Super easy to install by myself, less than 10 minutes.<br />Rock solid, I put 2 sets of folding J style kayak racks on them and haul two 10' Pelican yaks.<br />Instructions are VERY vague, but they get the point across.
B0060Z5OKU|1|I was disappointed that I thought I was buying a new carburetor, and when it arrived it was a new remanufactured carb. I felt the description as new carb was deceptive. I am in the process now of trying to find a new carb as this remanufactured carb has been a nightmare and didn't work as well as the one I replaced. My mechanic advised me the only thing I can do is order another new carb. No stars
B00ZSNUBDK|3|I did not realize just how big Jumbo really was! This is definitely for a truck or SUV. I still use it and it provides even more protection for the smaller cars (Scion XD).
B00S4ZJPXG|5|Very nice and arrived before estimated delivery date. Good quality stickers! I will buy again from this seller.
B00HRSPUCQ|5|Reasonable price, as good and probably better than the original Ford part.
B0002P3IJ8|5|Worked great. Goes a long way and totally cures any rust problems.
B003YKXTSI|4|Nice. A bit heavy though.
B0070NNUQG|5|THANK YOU
B007VYHFAQ|5|No leaks at all on mine 1999 XJ.
B00TDJQC2E|5|SO-SO
B005BNG1U4|5|Everything jeep for me!!!
B00L7E80IW|4|Arrived on time and fit well. Tempo tissues work well.
B00HYIE1TM|5|Beautiful faucet, works great, installed it at the campsite. Very easy and fast. We may need to replace the bathroom fixtures next!  :-)
B000UK9DA8|5|Quick delivery.  Used on towing trailer about 600 miles roundtrip.
B00COYNZJ8|5|Turned out to be a great gift.
B00XKQUE16|4|Works really fine!! It's a great product
B001N1E9Y8|5|Good
B00F64MY8Q|4|Its nice, however, I'm unsure how long it will last
B000H8BU5Y|5|went on as easy as 1 2 3
B0006SU3QW|5|Not the thickest or most resilient plastic dip on the market but exactly what I expected for the price and very easy to apply. Spray can nozzle is quality and doesn't make a mess. It worked just fine for my light coating and protection needs. Plus you can always keep applying layers till you meet your thickness needs at this price.
B00CPW3SXC|3|get OEM
B000ABB1P2|5|Works great on my motorhome.
B007P05FBW|5|It was very easy to install in less than 15 minutes and works great on my 2014 Ford F-350 King Ranch with the Step Tailgate.  Watching install videos on YouTube helped make the install successful.  Though I did think I was going to break the Threads when tightening the bolts to 15 ft/lbs.
B001OMKFKS|5|works great but need a new pulse generator
B00W6J0NEG|5|Perfect fit would recommend to anyone
B00832OJFO|5|It fits my 2008 nissan altima sedan 2.5 s. Those 4 circle seals weren't needed because the valve cover has those embedded in it. So when it goes bad an oil starts to get into the spark plug tube the whole valve cover has to be changed.
B0059XCVVO|5|Adhesion was good. Would recommend getting a tool
B002UC8OFE|5|Perfect
B00H47C8OS|5|came fast, decently priced, as advertised
B003AZH78U|5|Transmission is always great and I always use Spectro.
B000LZEKHS|4|Its the oil you use in your honda no more no less.
B00T2GT9L4|4|Useful. Works well.
B001OMPJGS|5|great
B00KTJ1VNM|1|This key does not work on new Ford's with PATS system. Very upset and disappointed that they did not advertise this. Waste of money.
B000CFRZTM|3|Leaky connectors!  Not fun to fix after initial installation.  Another reviewer reported he replaced the Parker connectors that came with the kit with SMC brand push-on connectors.  Amazon sells them. Once that was completed, no more leaky system but not an easy fix.  I bought the system primarily for the dual gauges and the ability to monitor and adjust when and if needed to balance our truck camper at any time, under any circumstance.  I consider this a safety consideration with a TC.  The cost of replacement connectors is minimal, especially if you put them in when initially setting up the system.  Once again I see the value in reading the reviews - thoroughly!
B0024NSP12|2|had condensation in both sides after 1 month
B005NLQAHS|5|It worhed as expected , Love it.
B002UJVNFA|4|Great set of glasses. One for anytime of day or night!  Seal around the eyes to prevent wind getting in your eyes!  Great deal for the money
B003K07SDY|5|i hope the letters are dark enough for other people to see and not just me
B009A4KDJ0|1|This part was all wrong. Firstly the part was broken when I received it. The plastic piece holding the strainer was snapped. I'm without a car so I figured I'll just use my old one so I don't have to wait another few days for another part. THEN I saw spectra stickers on the part so I peeled them of and can you believe that the part is actually an airtex!!!! FALSE ADVERTISMENT!!!!  That is against the law my friends. Do not buy!!!
B004HZ02MK|5|Well built
B002ZS4QCS|5|I installed these last week in a Santa Fe. It was so easy. The hooks work well for me because I have grandchildren that I haul around. With these hooks, I can keep items in a bag(s) off the floor preventing things from being stepped and walked on. Just yesterday I stopped at a retailer and exited with a bag containing flaxseed oil, a prescription, and a pack of gum. I hung it on the hook and everything came home with me clean and in its place.
B00CC2ZBIU|3|I love this HID but there is one problem.<br />I turn on the car first then I turn the hid but my car engine shutdown and engine sign will come on. The engine sign will go away the next day<br /><br />It works after I leave the car running for 5 min then there is no problem.<br /><br />Do you guys think the battery need to heat up or what.<br /><br />If anyone knows how to fix pls reply<br />I have Honda accord
B006RZJRXS|5|All the parts I needed to repair this old atv carb
B00B0YEZKG|5|Very happy with the stickers, thanks for the great service!
B00ITN90P6|5|Perfect replacement fit for the 2000 Ford Excursion fuel tank filler neck, and way less expensive than the Ford OEM part.
B005CLPSAO|5|Fit like OEM very happy with it.
B000E35VKW|5|The product arrived on time. Very satisfied with the order and product.
B001DRFIZQ|5|Quiet, effective, and on amazon you can replace front and rear before you can cover an axel's cost at most major chains
B00BYGTU00|5|Exactly what I hoped for.
B00UPKHRJM|1|Like the design, wanted to display it on my Motorcycle trailer. Did not come with application instructions. Did not peel, so I tried soaking, only ruined the sticker. Don't know if the sticker was defective, or the method I chose to apply was flawed, either way it was a waste of time and money.
B001RBCU90|4|I received the mail that got creased. I was afraid that it might fold along the decal, but luckily it didn't. Great decal. I put it on and had a few air bubbles on it but no big deal. Looks pretty on my car. For true dog lovers, it's a must have.
B00PGQYB1M|5|I received these as a free review sample over three months ago and have been testing them for over a month.  The main thing I love is they are exceptionally well constructed.<br /><br />Since others have covered many aspects of these lights I'll spare you repeats. Here are a few things that I think are important; First, the pigtail that you need to splice into your electrical system is very heavy duty. You will need to run a lead wire from your vehicle's fuse box to it with a waterproof connector. I am mentioning this because this set is designed to be installed by professionals or hobbyists who are familiar with wiring.<br /><br />The lights in this set have a wide operating range between 9 and 36 volts, so as long as you have access to a DC power source in that range powering them will be easy.<br /><br />These are truly off-road quality. In fact, I want to emphasize that for regular, public road use you will want to connect these to a switch because they are bright enough to blind oncoming drivers.<br /><br />If you are looking for heavy duty lights for off road use these are rugged and built like a tank.
B00O3TRPIE|5|Just bought it for my woman for fun nice key chain
B00W5MG8XY|5|Great tool!
B003POLA84|5|Good stuff. Gets the tar off my finish, and easy to work with.
B00CPYC9BC|5|Well Made.  Nice having second shut-off valve also
B00ISTWK5S|5|Great service and product is great
B00JLJK5F6|5|Fit my 2007 Dodge Grand Caravan with 3.8 liter V6 engine.  Took about 15 minutes to replace.  Bottom bolt is tight but can be removed without removing or loosening alternator.  Once this was replaced I re-set the check engine light with my scanner and it has stayed off since (2 weeks now).
B00MGMBTRS|4|Good for small dent
B0078797VQ|5|Fast delivery, nice product. Did have to watch a YouTube video to learn how to install.
B00T7CE0YY|5|Excellent!
B000C5I2YO|5|Fit Perfectly.
B00LV4T22Q|3|I really like these screws minus not really paying attention that they are hex screws. But they work well with the other add-on's I installed.
B004R39PSY|3|This was a ramp alone, and was not listed that way.it works well, but I had to order the actual cargo hauler separately
B000CGROO2|5|Good replacement part.
B004FWG28S|5|Increase in faster Spooling.
B0070Y36WI|5|It look very nice
B000CPIMWQ|3|Paint didn't shine like the reviews said it was supposed to. I put 5 layers on and it was a gloss black for like a week then it faded into a matte black. It looks alright and it's easy to use, but this isn't exactly what I wanted it to look like.
B008GG7KLW|1|Didn't not fit my Nissan Altima 08. Not happy at all. Make sure you double check its correct before removing you bumper.
B008Y1Z782|3|I just don't like it when they don't put that little rubber ring in there, I've had to reuse the old one and that is a no no per the manual.
B006ZVJ88I|1|Item was not needed for my vehicle unfortunately I did not find out until return time expired
B00F6769PW|4|Exactly as expected,  Wish it came with better instructions and the puller device required to remove it.  Thanks, Chris
B001DUB1TK|5|Good product
B00AQ45TL0|1|This item had a defective spline and nearly caused me to have a serious accident.  It also caused me to think my steering gear box was bad. I had to return it and wasted alot of time and money on three separate gear boxes unitl the defective spline was dicovered.
B00068XCQU|5|Arrived on time, and took 5 minutes to install.  The jumper cable clips are a bonus, if anybody needs them when I'm away from home.
B0028NEWCO|5|these are my favorite riding glasses, they fit my face  perfect and seal out most wind
B00NB8U7S8|4|Two map lights were different had to make adjustments
B005DFNR4I|5|I strongly recommend these seat covers, best purchase I made for my SUV!
B00VGBF8CW|5|Excellent and trustworthy, fast response. Keep it up. You deserve more than 5 stars.
B00AY1Z0HS|1|Product failed after 3 months of use. Has not been exchanged. Would NOT recommend.
B006X8D3J8|5|Good grill for the money and fast shipping.
B00FGXELFG|5|Great switch.  Love it.  Fits perfect in the factory switch spot on the TJ.  Awesome.
B008PPGCGI|5|Worked great and good quality. I be buying these again!
B0024ECCJW|5|Excellent product and easy installation.
B00OMT6UEK|4|Works great in my E46 BMW M3, except it falls out randomly.
B00BC3726O|5|This helmet is bad a$$ I love it sit low and looks great would buy again
B00MNV38SK|5|Good lights
B0081S997I|5|GREAT PRODUCT FOR THE MONEY  POLARIS WANTS A LOT OF MONEY FOR THERES
B007GIYNJS|5|Good quality product and easy to install, I really satisfied!
B006OIM0P0|5|It added the extra length to block the rising sun on my helmet.
B00RW7XE8E|5|Much better than the stock OEM wipers from Toyota! Much better wiping of water and dirt.
B00KTJ9G0C|4|Served it's purpose...buttons wear out fast but fit and swap was fast and easy...for the price we worth it.
B001P29LUC|2|doesn't cover the top of tailgate sufficiently and cheap material for the price. But it did fit adequately.
B000Q0R56G|5|No Leaks!  Worked Great!
B0019I87PC|5|Junk
B00V30J86I|1|Won't fit in our Prius.  A good Idea that must be re-thought.
B00D1CQVIY|5|awesome harness worth the money
B00KVVBEWQ|1|According to Magellan, this device is customized for RV's. The setup screen asks for the size (length, height, type) of your RV. Once input, I couldn't detect any use of that data by the RoadMate. In order to test it, we took the Roadmate on a weekend RV trip from Seattle to Cape Disappointment Washington. It's about 200 miles. We drive a Ford F350 (2014) with built-in navigation. We ran the units side by side. But, I'm getting ahead of myself.<br /><br />The Getting Started guide instructs you to connect the nav to your computer via USB and log in to their site to register and update the unit. I did that. I also learned that Yelp is not loaded by default, but you can get it on the site. So, after a lot of fumbling I learned that I had to &#34;trade&#34; a feature for Yelp, so I deleted the web browser and told the site to send me Yelp. It took over six hours to complete that download. That really seemed excessive to me.<br /><br />I told the Nav to find Cape Disappointment State Park. It had no trouble finding it in its atlas. I added it to my address brook. On the day of the trip, I used the included suction cup mount to put the unit in view over the dash. I plugged it into a utility outlet. One thing to note, you need to mount the plug on the mounting bracket. Then, when you insert the GPS unit, it is connected. I didn't realize that and had to take the mount apart to get the power cord in.<br /><br />There are a number of things that Magellan doesn't tell you before you buy. It turns out that the road advisory information requires that you connect the GPS to your cell phone by Bluetooth. If you lose cell service,  you lose all of the nice features like advisories and gas prices. The Magellan will use your phone's data plan to keep itself updated and download traffic advisories (most of which should have been in the unit's memory) and gas prices. Since our trip to the coast crossed many miles where there is no cell service, all we got was basic navigation.<br /><br />The navigation itself is clearly very old code. The voice prompts sound just like my 2004 Prius; bad pronunciation with an artificial-sounding mechanical voice. Hearing the Magellan and the Ford nav at the same time clearly pointed out how crude the Magellan voice is. I also have a two-year-old Garmin unit (one of the less expensive) that has great sounding voice prompts.<br /><br />That's not the worst part. On the way home, while driving on I5, the Magellan suddenly made an alarm bell sound and lit up with a warning that I5 was closed 45 miles ahead. It immediately displayed a detour route. That would have been fine, but when we checked the Ford navigation and XM traffic reports, there was absolutely no information about a closure. We stayed on I5. Sending serious false alarms alone takes my review to one star. But wait, there's more! Frequently while making a turn (that it told us to make), it would instantly say, &#34;Make the next possible U-turn!&#34;. Then, it would go on with the route. What's with that?<br /><br />The biggest giveaway that this unit has old code is the way it handles route changes. Both nav systems offered two possibilities to get to Cape Disappointment. There are actually three good choices. Ford and Magellan selected as the first choice I5 to US 101. We took that route a couple of years ago. It is nasty for RV's; lots of narrow spots, traffic lights, and towns along the way. I have no idea why both think it is the fastest route. The second route offered by both takes I5 to WA12 to US 101. This isn't too bad. We had tried that one too. The third route which neither system selects is I5 to WA Rt 6 to US 101. The third route we find is the easiest when towing our fifth wheel.<br /><br />When we passed the exit for US101, both systems tried to get us to exit and go back to the US 101 exit. The Ford system gave up after only a few miles. The Magellan stubbornly kept trying to turn around for over 15 miles. The Ford unit figured out that WA 12 would work. It did quickly with little fuss. The Magellan kept trying to get us to turn around until we were close to the Rt. 12 exit. Then it got with that program. After we passed that exit, both systems tried to turn us around again. The Ford unit figured out we wanted Rt 6 fairly soon. The Magellan wouldn't shut up.In 2006, the Toyota nav behaved just like the Magellan. The 2014 Ford unit is much smarter.<br /><br />It's clear that both units have the same digital maps. Magellan just uses old software to integrate with them. One other thing, as far as we could tell the Magellan does not take our RV into account when it offers routes. We used it after we arrived to help us find points of interest. It was very happy to route us onto small roads that say &#34;No RV's&#34;. So much for that claim.<br /><br />It does have a couple of features designed for RV drivers: It has a database of public dump stations and displays them as you drive. It also includes Good Sam campgrounds in its point of interest database. Neither feature is of any value to us. As for Yelp, most reviews are for larger towns. So, when touring on the shore, Yelp was silent.<br /><br />Once coupled with your phone, it becomes a hands-free phone for you. It works very much like the Ford Sync built in Bluetooth unit. The seven inch display was excellent. It looked better than the seven inch built-in screen on the truck. It's crystal clear with very good color and resolution.<br /><br />I really wanted this unit to be the missing link that would give us routing designed for our RV. It didn't. There are other RV-themed nav systems out there. I'm not sure if they offer true RV routing, but the Magellan doesn't. With its false road closure notice and very dated software, I just can't recommend this unit.ying to get us to turn around until we were close to the Rt. 12 exit. Then it got with that program.

B00CN016US|5|High quality. Fit and price is great
B008EVYJD6|5|Awesome tire
B000VAXBUU|5|the rickey booby dodge has better racing stops because of these cailipers, almost ran over three illegal aliens the other day in the road, great brakes<br />for the rickey bobby dodge!!
B008MCNY1A|5|Excellent part
B0012RI5IO|5|super easy-to-install kit.  Worked well over a year now.
B00UBXP3ZI|5|I can't believe how cheap I got this cat back system.  I just couldn't say no.  It was easy to install and sound great on my blacked out 2015 Stang.  Love this product!
B00K1C1WC2|5|They work as they should and are nice and bright in hopes you don't forget them.
B000IOODM4|5|THANK YOU
B00I98YNN0|5|Works great!
B003TKRZ7Y|5|instructions could add a couple pictures on were they expect you to mount it but i figured it out.
B00K1NS0PS|5|No problems so far
B000CCBMF8|1|I bought this bike rack thinking I wouldn't have any problems, but after 3 months the area that turns the bikes to sway away started to tilt. I e-mailed surco but after a week with no reply I called, the so called owner said he never had this problem before and said that the bolt and nut that holds this unit could never come apart but I have one, I expected he would send me a new one but he wanted me to send it back to Cal (I'm in RI) so they could fix it. As I am traveling I would have no time to wait for them to fix it and send it back. That didn't seem to bother him as he said the only option would be to send it back (not a option to me). I am writing this because I have two bikes no where to put them, I'm on the road for another 3 months with a bike rack that might fall apart. Please DO NOT buy from this company, bad customer support if you can call a shouting match good for customer relations. I would never buy another product again...................
B006GFLI0O|5|Love it. No more wiping my forehead. It does as described
B00WJPGZN0|5|Just what I neeeded
B007A3N1CE|1|This pontoon cover says it fits pontoons up to 26 feet long, ours is 24 feet & it does NOT fit!! It's too short
B00FQ0ROZS|5|These lights work awesome I will be buying more of them
B005GLNAFK|2|Does not fit in the factory light socket.  Waste of money
B00NMOYPVG|5|Great item
B00CQD4BUE|5|Exelent!
B00CHD3PPK|5|Took a little to get here than I anticipated, but I wasn't in a hurry.
B0066RTUUC|4|Part was a good fit. My old support bearing gave out because of the rubber mount had failed. I half expected the new mount to have a stiffer rubber mount but it was quite flexible. The car still has a slight vibration at different speeds. I double checked the drive shaft alignment, balance, and all that looks good. All in all I am satisfied with the replacement. We will see how long it lasts.
B0006JO0XI|5|I was build a solar panel kit. This is my first attend and turn out work out prefect as i expected
B00JIJ4LWW|5|We purchased a used leather sectional couch. The couch definitely had wear and tear. I applied Leather Nova (heavily the first time) and the leather felt like new again. It was soft to the touch and the Leather Nova didn't come off or make your clothes feel &#34;wet&#34; after sitting on the couch. This is a GREAT product.
B009IFIETM|1|Did not fit 2006 Chevy Silverado 1500 as stated in description. Now I have to pay 1/4 of the total price for return shipping!!! Need to change compatiblity discription.
B004M5SHZE|2|Items received were not as pictured.  Thin metallic grooved decals that were silver and about 3 inches x 3 inches.
B00844VZ9O|5|It's our 3rd and we enjoy using every one. We were a little disappointed that the plates and thumbscrews weren't included as they were on the last one I bought.
B000B8YE62|5|Happy with it.
B00077UL6E|4|Good but a tight fit for an '05 sienna xle
B00C0SQ8KG|5|Amazing light for the money very bright at night put on buggy lights up the woods for hunting very happy
B0009IQZH0|3|Wish it was a thicker, higher quality microfiber. Slightly disappointed since it has the meguiars name
B000K9XTRC|5|Very nice
B001HKZHIW|5|Pumping is not my idea of fun, but this gets the job done very efficiently!
B000F0QT1O|5|Fit as described and cuts down on the glare of a silver dash.
B004I0JRRA|5|great price
B007XY1A9G|1|Product arrived missing parts.
B00ZVJ3FUM|4|These fit amazingly well. I have a GMC Terrain. They are comfortable and it's good to know my seats will stay looking new longer with these on. They seam easy to clean up up something spills on them. As always fast shipping. No reason to be spending $$$ on seat covers when you can get these ones here.
B00279FG92|1|I installed this dip stick on my girlfriend's car.  I checked the oil level, wiped the stick clean and went to check the level again and the handle BROKE.  This think lasted less than 30 seconds.  Now the remaining stick is in the oil guide tube.  Now I have to spend my Saturday trying to remove it.  DO NOT BUY.
B000276B2C|4|Okay
B00M78820I|5|Received very promptly, product just as described. Very pleased.
B000C8RD3M|4|Good quality, not as good as OEM.
B00O8ZNJ2Y|3|So far they look great and shipped fast...but didn't connect up securely to my 2007 Avalanche. I figure they will need reinstalled after driving some.
B00D9E3GTG|5|I bought this for my wife, along with the Picnic at Ascot Collapsible Basket Cooler. We took both on a trip to Washington State and British Columbia and had several picnics while traveling. We used both products together and they were great. The Camco Picnic Blanket is the perfect companion for the Picnic at Ascot Collapsible Basket Cooler. The picnic basket and picnic blanket were a matching red and white (the picnic basket was mostly red).
B0073UQ5YA|5|Nice and bright works like a champ.  Instructions don't say that the black wire has to be Grounded in order for the LCD display to work.
B003L9K9HQ|5|Excellent
B00KL3ALGO|5|These stick really well and block the sun. Great product.
B000AMBOI0|5|Good product!
B007HG7TFO|5|These are made by Gas Flo (stamped on them), and are compatible with the low pressure MB Sturgis 250 fittings.  These male end fits the low presure BBQ connection on the front of our Airstream trailer.  The female is the same fitting that Airstream put on the trailer.
B006JDDWAM|5|Fits perfect, out here in the Az. high temp helps to have replacement
B000GTZ6G8|5|Just as described. quick shipping great seller. A+
B000ZAV6E4|5|Fit great and I love the rear pockets!
B0010GG7YG|5|Fit perfectly
B003IS3HV0|5|First of all, my order of Leathet Honey Conditioner arrived as expected. I wold say that this product  is excellently made. It is not cheaply made and had contributed  a major change on the appearance , suppleness, and beauty of my leather furniture. After the application, I left it overnight, and there I noticed an immediate change the morning after. I was happy with my purchase and I would not hesitate to tell my friends about this product.
B00D393XYA|4|Was happy with quality
B002N4PZLK|5|I love Valeo wipers.  They clean the windshield well and last a long time.  Easy to change.
B002UZGCSW|5|Item as decribed.
B004FJPS5Y|4|GOOD
B00II5YADC|2|It's ok, not the best for drying.  Leaves skip marks and squeaks way too much.  I also have a carbon fiber roof so don't feel comfortable sqeaking on top of it making it feel it's scratching it.
B00LL1OWRO|4|Not quite as bright as the original bulbs, but they use MUCH less energy.  They are very weak at the base so be careful when pushing into the outlet.  I gave 4 stars cause one (out of 20) is giving me problems (keeps going on & off for no apparent reason).  Overall, well worth the money spent.
B00G3AJJP8|5|Fits and looks great !
B00PQWN5DQ|5|This is a great tire pressure gauge and totally easy to use. I love the fact that the measurement stays in place when you disconnect the gauge from the tire. It stays in place until you hit the pressure release button on the side. I also like that I can turn the neck of the gauge all the way around, instead of having to hold the gauge at weird angles in order to get the measurement. I don't know many other gauges that allow you to do that and it really makes a difference. It also feels really good in the hand when you use it and doesn't start hurting after a long period of time when trying to get the measurement, like some other ones do, It's a really good design and a great tire gauge.
B000C11JJ8|4|Arrived on time, at cost, exact fit. Not as heavy duty as OE but well worth the price-works fine.
B0006VORDY|3|Nice workmanship. Have an oven that was made by the same company. Went together fast (attaching the 4 legs) and it's ability to just sit on top of a table w/o the legs. Knobs are out of the way (they don't stick out) as to allow banging or busting them off. Even the hose can be stowed out of the way. Heat/wind blocker went on well. But here's why it got 3 stars. It's doesn't put out a flame like the &#34;turbo burners&#34; aka turkey friers do. I didn't expect it to be like a F-14 tomcat engine but it really doesn't push much flame. I tried every adjustment I could. I even secured one burner. No difference. Seemed as though there was no pressure from my tank. I tried another FULL tank (1st one was full when started). Same results. Was just trying to boil some water to warm spaghetti noddles and warm up some sauce in some large stainless steel pots. About the 4 gallon size. So, if you want something to go from zero to 60 fast, you might want to forget it. At this point, don't see any reason to get any attachments (griddle, oven) because it just doesn't have enough power to do the job.
B0039ZCKJW|5|Excellent!
B00PI7K2SA|4|so hard to put on!!  good luck
B00KJ8L7B4|4|Install is a PITA on 2014 accord but they work great. Got the 35W, not the brightest bulb ever but huge improvement over stock halogen lights.  I can now see the road with no eye fatigue
B0012TYTH8|5|GOOD COVER.
B000E4LONE|5|Ok
B00851NNBE|1|Did not work and shorted my whole electrical system. AVOID!!
B00V30J86I|1|Very small.  Wouldn't fit in my Traverse.  Might fit a Mini Cooper or  a Smartcar.  Useless to me.
B0013KWR3Y|1|This rug came and didn't look like the picture. ..it was dull...disappointed
B008BX634K|5|love it..just enough light for what I need. easy to install and wire.
B001AV4CNO|2|These are not genuine BMW OEM.  They are a copy, a good copy, but a copy nevertheless.
B004LOGS70|5|This emblem is not cheap looking at all.  It is very well made and looks real good.  I mounted them on the battery box of my ebike.  I have received some nice compliments on them.  Applying them was a breeze and I don't see them ever falling off.
B00KTIZO0O|5|I love it!!!! Came on time and very easy to program. It fits my personality with the color!
B000O80AZS|5|Works great.
B0029TQDLA|2|I started using this product when I received it on June 7 and I already have to repurchase new ones. I don't know if material is not made to stand Florida heat but it has lost shape and will not stay on rear-view mirror.
B00KG14LLM|4|Great price and quality
B007Q92GT6|4|Outside is very nice & durable.  Plastic holders inside are cheaply made but for the price it's just what I need.
B00ZY5MFHM|5|We got this helmet because my daughter needed a quality, safe, adjustable helmet - AND she wanted a cool color. We were both satisfied with the Ovation. It has the dial in back (like many bike helmets) to adjust it for the correct, safest fit. It's vented, which will help keep her cooler in the hot AZ summers.  Her riding instructor said it fits perfectly.  My daughter's old helmet, a XS Troxel without the dial adjustment feature, was too loose, and therefore unsafe at this time for her head.  I was glad to find an adjustable helmet with the perfect fit.
B0086GCJFO|5|Exactly as described, perfect fit.  Works well.
B0063SISKM|4|Nice and soft.  Great dash mop!
B001FI72E8|2|Come to find out it was the wrong part of my car.  So I could not use it.
B0036IA6JI|5|Works just like dealer part. But the cost. $11.00 vs $56.00 and free shipping. No way to beat that.
B00GKTWNXM|5|Nice product.  Easily visible.
B000VTYIK8|5|Seems to do a good job of at least it's piece of mind! I use on my soft top for the wrangler.
B000E28C7M|4|As always, K&N Products are good like this Oil Filter which I purchased from Amazon over two years ago and it was shipped with no problem to my APO-AP address. However, I tried to re-order it again from Amazon and now it can’t be shipped to my APO-AP address which makes no sense since it is just a filter. Any other seller of this K&N, Oil Filer also ships to APO-AP but at a higher cost than Amazon.
B004MUQOUY|1|Tried these in 3 different positions on my car, In every position the mirror barely showed any more than I could already see in the regular mirror, and what extra angle it did show was distorted and small because of the oval shape of the mirror.<br /><br />Even if your side mirrors aren't rectangular, get rectangular blind spot mirrors. These things just made me more insecure than not having them at all.<br /><br />I found a similar priced better option at a local chain store, these went into the garbage.
B00XZCH7LK|5|Very well made, fits well.  Liner is easy to remove and put in.  With liner out, jacket is cool enough to wear even in hot temps, the mesh breathes well.  Had to order up one size to get a good fit with enough room for a sweatshirt to wear underneath for use in colder weather.  Velcro closures on sleeves give a nice tight seal.
B00DI3DV6G|3|Handle broke after a few months.
B0009IG3SG|5|I love this stuff, have been using it for at least a decade, and can't find it in any brick and mortar stores. It has no smell, is gentle on hands, and can be used for just about anything.
B000W7F2GI|5|the best
B006QY46KY|5|Beautiful product. Does not need cleaning prior to install. Will buy again.
B005HAYDR4|5|Fit great look and work awesome
B003E20RKE|5|Installed beautifully. Smooth braking so far.  Wish they came with abutment hardware.
B00G620ZVU|5|got to love the new lights very bright
B002JH469I|5|Nice looking product. Only con is you can see a little of the white adhesive pad after adhering to your car if you look at the right angle. Bought two and only have this problem with one. Overall good product. Several weeks and washes later and is still adhering well.
B00IK9WF6A|5|Great coil my trike wouldn't run and this did the trick
B00M250FNI|5|These lights work great and were easy to install. I got them for my motorcycle hitch carrier and love them so far.
B00EA2VXMI|5|For some reason I thought this would be a sturdy metal, but it was plastic. It's been on the front plate of my car for 3 days and I LOVE it! The pattern is phenomenal in person :)
B00KLZ65GM|5|Good seller and product. Highly recommended.
B00AZSPOD0|1|i got a bad one or they're just crap the &#34;turbine&#34; inside  is held in by a small pin ....well it's supposed to be anyway ...mine wasn't .
B00ERYNWVE|5|beauty!
B00CMX20H4|5|Easy to install and wire with the Universal Plug-n-Play Wiring Harness for Motorcycle Air Horns. This horn is great!
B001KYSBO2|5|Used for cleaning retro video game consoles, worked perfectly.
B009LOZPY2|5|Fits well and works great.
B000C9OTBA|5|Fast ship, quality product
B000C9ODR0|5|plug better engine start booth
B003X9TLUK|5|Worked perfect.
B00Y3H3846|5|With  a raised truck,  this is great to get up and into the engine compartment.
B000ICCS7I|5|Cleaned out some oil holes in an antique car engine that other solvents didn't.
B00CF498GQ|5|Easily add to your rc for lap timing at most tracks. Highly recommended for racers.
B003CSJF26|1|These do not fit the 2007 2500HD crew cab as stated in the product description.  Driver's side fits good.  Passenger side does not follow contour of floorboard towards middle console which causes the liner to buckle.  Second row liner does not lay flat.  Recommend the Weathertech 460031-460625 if you are looking for a good fitting liner.  The vendor, Concept Z Performance, took back the product but I had to pay for shipping which is understandable.
B00F49XKBI|1|Product, I'm sure, is great - but for a 50 state legal CARB exempt product, shipper will not deliver to California - absolute BOGUS.
B00415B7ZM|3|It does not hold water in the tank. Other than that, it works fine.
B000Y87RN6|5|Worked like a charm.
B00BITRCYY|5|It is exact replacement part for 1988 Toyota celica.
B0087Y9SP4|5|Worked perfect for replacing a switch on a fish tank light
B0093XLGVM|5|excellent very happy purchase
B002MPG1N6|5|Looks good on a black car
B000IYWWKO|5|Purchased for 2014 Ford F 150.......Perfect match to the factory trim and protects from scuffs and scratches from getting in and out of the truck. Easy to install and so far very durable.
B00FJ5LBOA|5|This Shop blower is awesome.  Gave it to my husband for Xmas to use in his shop, be loves out.  But I also use it for blowing the garage and patio.  Light but powerful enough for sidewalk and patio clean up.  Small, powerful and convenient...doesn't get any better than that! Really love it.
B00B71SXNW|1|Oh no they didn't! I never understand how you get two different blades and both of them get streaks. I didn't complain to the seller because I don't really care to be honest. I just replace my blades every year so that they don't damage my wind shield. But if you're looking for streak free, these are not the blades. You get what you pay for I guess. They did have the correct adapters for my 2012 Jetta.
B00JVHLS3G|1|Emblem faded after a month on car. Wouldn't buy this again!
B001QUDVWW|5|Went in easy
B000CKN22Q|5|Thanks .
B00GD9YKM6|5|Excellent
B00M9LY1U8|5|Installation was pretty straightforward although I would definitely have a second set of hands if you wish to self install.  Alignment of pipes is tricky  but in the end I am pretty satisfied with the look.  The Bassani Pipes are well designed.  I plugged these in and literally did nothing else to the bike and it runs great.  I will have it tuned when I go in for my next service but don't think its absolutely necessary.  With an Open pipe there is little you can do to prevent back pressure except design the pipe well and these are basically open pipes with just a little baffling at the turnouts.  Beautiful Plating Job.  Loud as hell, but not so loud as to make riding uncomfortable.  Great pipes all around.  One note though; Vibration increases slightly as these pipes are substantially lighter and do not have the crossover! True 2 into 2.
B00BTLEJAQ|3|for the price the quality was expected. i did order for a 2006 charger but the rear seats in my  car did not have adjustable head rests which made the over all fit for the covers not as advertised. keeping them for now they still will perform the same just the snugness is not as tight as it normally would be.
B005CDNCQO|4|VERY GOOD
B0049B6O8I|3|Would give it 4 stars but I had to cut off the two hanger rods Because they interfered with the hanger rods on the<br />Bosal 286-061 Exhaust Silencer, which looked to be more substantial. Nice and quiet, hope it lasts.
B00P5YP04C|4|Seller's service was excellent. The emblems really liven up otherwise dull alloy wheels.
B00H3Q09WI|2|There's a sucker born every minute...PT Barnum. Amaozon sells the same thing by Lund for about 60 bucks. I tried and they made the wind noise even worse.<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/Auto-Ventshade-194972-In-Channel-Ventvisor/dp/B00N679XHA
B0002MAANI|5|Arrived on time,  and they work great, we drove from Michigan to Florida,  and did not have to re-tighten at all.
B004SHWWN4|3|Goggles fit well over my glasses most of the time. Sometimes when riding the goggles shift around pushing my glasses towards my face and making it extremely uncomfortable at times. When going at high speeds, 50-80 mph there is too much airflow that makes my eyes watery. Some dust particles gets through the goggles and bothers me at times.<br /><br />Overall, works well, great on a hot day when riding. Wish it would work better with my glasses at times.<br /><br />For packaging, it just came in a microfiber bag, no box or anything, seemed kind of sketch, but...eh.
B002LEEX74|5|It looks great on my car! I love that the words are all raised.
B00JF4D7KM|1|It was a good color i like but now the mirror tint is fading<br /><br />It bloury i cant see clear out of it<br /><br />I want to return it and get a black tint
B0073W281W|1|The antenna did not fit and there wasn't an adapter to help fit it! Frustrating!
B00B9ET8IG|5|This key is perfect if.... You have the old transponder chip to replace in this new unit, as this unit does not come with one. You can have this new key cut for free or cheap. If not your better off going to the dealer to get a whole new key programmed (not just to open the door) to start the car too.
B003CSNKUO|5|Fits well and installs in literally 5 seconds.  Hold the Mini Max perfectly.
B000760FWU|5|Works great on my 26ft. trailer. Worth buying this product.
B00KQRAYIU|4|it works on 2015 FR-S...thanks..the price is good . cheaper than dealership
B00UBTH23S|4|i like it
B007WU71TO|5|Very good quality.
B001GH1P3W|5|Works great in my 07' JKUR (Auto)
B0040IV0Y8|1|I received this cap round the first week of May and it came off in Sunday August 10, 2015 almost 2 months later, but was this the right cap for my truck? Before I purchase another one? 1999 Ford f-150 4.6L
B00NOL6RSG|5|It is very bright and has a flash pattern for virtually anything you would need in emergency services. It moves traffic well during the day and night and yet it is still small enough to sit on your windshield and not obstruct traffic.
B007NGB5W6|5|Very nice quality! Not a real heavy leather, but super comfy!
B001DRHMPK|5|Fits jetta mk5 just fine.
B00KBKOAGY|5|really does the job!!
B00P9EJGR0|5|Great product. Not only does this do its job as a protectant for the back of my seat but it also is easy to clean and fits perfectly! I am very pleased with this kick mat.
B00363M0TC|5|I'm glad I bought it save me money on repairs.

B00E9I97QC|5|Perfect fit 2009 honda pilot.
B00OZXYDHE|5|shipped well and as just as described
B0037IOSR8|4|Really helps my Sciatica, especially when driving my car.
B00H9S71LW|1|Plugged it into my car (2009 Traverse) and it set a code and car would not start.  Removed this from the car and car started just fine.  It left an error code about CAN communication. So far very limited use from the device.
B00G23NN0S|5|They look nice and they have the rubberized inserts !

B006WL6YU6|5|I loved this tool so freaking much it have everything In one no need to have anything else. I would totally recommend this item
B00EJFH6YA|5|Best $49.99 I have ever spent.  My buddy has the same size rigid, other than the price; we have yet to find the difference between the two.
B008V2N2KE|5|Love, love, love these mats. Clean look! Protects interior and matches trunk mat. Buy now!
B004Q864Q6|5|Fit was perfect. Looks good and keeps safety tools in a great place.  Toe rope, jumper cables, flares.
B00LNN3MRQ|3|This would probably be a good replacement of your spring is broken, but I felt zero difference with it installed over the factory spring.
B00CIMSGSG|5|Great product, great price, fast shipping!
B000MLZ4SU|5|contrary to the negative first review, I am happy with the trailer ball. I ordered a second one.  The seller says its made in USA, but there are no markings to verify that. The threads were clean and fully functional. I recommend this to others.  Avoid products mfg'd in China.
B0010E1LYY|5|Just what I ordered fits perfect and smells great!
B0027QWNI2|5|Just what I was looking for small but with lots of compartments for everything I need to store my car
B005OKF5TW|5|I love WeatherTech products. I got this one for my 2007 Toyota Sienna LXE Limited.<br />We go to the beach about 2x a week, and I wanted something to keep the sand out of the van's cargo carpet. The WeatherTech cargo mat has a thick lip surrounding the mat that makes removal of sand, dirt, trash, water, all very easy.<br />I can reach down, and use two hands to pick up the mat and put it on the driveway to hose off, when we spilled some sauce on it. Very easy to clean and dry out. Ended up getting a complete floor-mat set for the rest of my van after buying this one.
B0065X7Q7G|5|Great fit and quality shirt.
B000AMQM4Q|5|Awesome! This is very well made and adds character to any Vehicle .  I customized mine to match the other emblems on my Truck but it is a well made product !
B0098UD90G|5|These gloves are very comfortable. I have been wearing them while riding my motorcycle and they also breath really well in warm weather.
B00NGZSUQC|5|Heavy duty stuff.....went together nicely......we'll see how long they last. ..
B0013FUFUQ|1|The cable was exactly the correct one and fit like it should and works nice.
B00A2F38NO|5|I bought this during prime day 2015.  I took this up to pennsic this year.  I ran the battery every day for a myriad of things.  I charged cell phones,  ran fans and lights,  and even charged up my 18v cordless.<br /><br />Now I brought over kill panels but this mixed with several of my other batteries and saved me countless space on batteries and unnecessary weight.
B002SA0WSK|5|great replacement product for worn out pads
B00BD4SKXG|2|Not a real good fit. They come off and slide around.
B000CPI5Z0|5|Good.  I guess it works.  I did slight improvement in the way my car drives.
B005GK23SQ|2|Wheels can barely be pushed on a concrete garage... Defeats its very purpose! Pretty disappointed
B003YD3O7G|5|Works great on my half helmet!
B00MQ1GNUC|4|cheap easy replacement. doesnt have the same optical range as oem, but close.
B00OP2BP5I|5|Works well.  Looks great.  Love the message.
B002ICIT6K|4|Sensor was as described. It took 10 minutes to install, I cleared  the codes, and all was good again.
B004LF6LPS|5|We used this bike cover for the first time this past weekend.  We have our two bikes on a Swagman 2-bike rack.....behind our  travel trailer.  Yes it was hard putting the cover over the bikes but we have side mirrors and power bars on the handlebars.  Plus we have racks on the back of the bikes.  BUT......the cover did it's job.  We used cords to tie the cover down to prevent it from blowing in the wind so much.<br />We were able to zip up the zipper in the back.  It was a workout but, like I said, the cover did it's job.  Not everything is going to be easy.<br />We have electric motors on these two bikes.  We take the electric bikes when we go camping.  A little effort protecting these two bikes is worth it.  The electric kits for our bikes were not cheap but they are a lot of fun especially when there are hills around.<br />We are very pleased with this cover.
B00VGL7E5G|5|Very solid, must say that around the chrome parts the steel is starting to show surface rust. But nothing serious.
B000JFNAMQ|5|Seams to be very accurate.
B00WOY33EA|5|It works very well . It needs to come in a set of two because If you are repairing one the other is soon to go as well.
B000CSPFVY|1|Washer and cap were missing for two out of four of the plugs I ordered. Pretty pathetic.
B00HQMZK3C|1|The products suck did not fit my 2014 Ford f-150 went right in the garbage
B00FRHOGU6|5|Works very well. Does the job.
B00N1E6M0E|2|Good quality but no instructions. There is no way to see how this lines up since neither end lines up with the end of a window or other distinctive point so you have to eyeball where you think it looks best.
B000BPSW7C|2|no shine???
B00YDDPH26|5|though I haven't used this yet but it's setup to go.  I love it
B002FE1J0E|4|We had troubles with our existing mounting screws because they weren't long enough grab onto the tabs provided. There was a slight difference in thickness of the plastic where the mounting screws go. Other than that they fit well and I'm very pleased.
B00093650W|5|works as expected. nice finish.
B000E28C8G|5|good
B00C6N19BS|4|Cheaper than original.
B0045L9J3O|5|Just as described. quick shipping great seller. A+
B0063CU6GM|5|Great product! It's durable and easy to install. The company's badge/emblem fell off after a week but not a big deal. Would recommend this item for anyone who wants to make their car look sleek and different.
B00BLAG5ZC|5|they work awesome very bright I love it thank you
B00KL0OTDS|5|Fits great and keeps the car cooler.  I can now touch the steering wheel and shifter when I get into the car without fear of burning my hands.
B0042A2WV4|3|Good price for this item and at least on my truck, 1999 B2500 Mazda  a good fit.
B004AHDBLE|5|excellent delivery. perfect product. Was just what we needed.
B004O844DS|5|Easy assembly!  Seems like a strong rack!
B00C890K8I|3|Beautiful helmet but that is the extent of it......the chin strap is too far ahead making me look like a chipmunk with it's cheeks full......it also makes me look like a mushroom head.  The last thing is it runs big I usually take an x-small to a small in helmets and I got this in an x-small and it still slipped around on my head, maybe I just have a weird shaped head???
B0010DPCKY|5|OEM fit but replacing the first set after only 20,000 miles. May go ACDelco professional next time around.
B005NLQAHS|5|Works like promissed. Slightly bulky so it gets in the way when driving with it plugged in but its possible to get an extension cord.
B001O2T43M|5|excellent!
B00C9V4EHI|1|This does NOT fit over your throttle if it is a 1 inch handlebar. I tried forever to get it on and it just wouldn't slide over the grip. Way too small.
B004LQAKOA|5|Fast shipping, looks great on vehicle
B000S2UG8G|5|Needed new wire set for our 99 saturn sl2. Worked well and has a little more pep.
B000COS628|5|Great fuel line gauge A+
B00JG74G12|4|I love wheel well liners.  They should be STOCK on ALL trucks.  However, if you must add them later, these are just as good as the factory ones.<br />I put these on a 2014 F-150 FX4 w/ Flares and Ford splash guards.<br /><br />Installation was a b_tch.  This is one of those jobs where the holes never line up and you need three hands at times.  In the end, I did it by myself and it took probably 90 minutes including putting tools away.
B00CBVMLYO|5|adorable
B00QMI3CZ4|3|As received they didn't work.  Somebody left off the final phase where the screws are given the final clearance cut.  I put them in a vise and used a drill press fitted with a socket and plenty of cutting oil to finish the threads, and now they work fine.  The quality is pretty good, but be ready to break them in before you use them.  I'm talking about threads so tight I had to slow down to keep them from getting hot. Once you do that, they are good quality and a real bargain at the price.  I'm getting a second set.
B00D2C1URK|5|Fit right works amazing now no more click click. The starter spins faster and not to difficult to put in, hardest part was getting the starter down by myself
B00FHI3KOS|5|Awesome
B00V9QJTCY|5|Exactly as advertised very well made and looks awesome on my1995 Tahoe brush gaurd.used free delivery box was damaged but product was in excellent condition.planning on buying more OZ USA products in future.can't tell you how many people ask where I got my light bar,they all love it.very happy with it
B009FUWU8G|4|The grill looks awesome but didn't come with the emblem shown and instructions were hard for me to understand.  Amazon was great to deal with though on that.  Overall once installed fit and finish is awesome despite not having the emblem I'd give it a five star for quality.
B0000AXMD6|4|It worked not as I read from previous feedbacks, but it did the job. You have to apply several times in order to acquire a transparent look.
B00LV4BX7I|4|great knockoff at a great price.
B00FOOVUK6|1|I've had this for about a month now and it's already broken.
B000GVEY64|5|Great product!!  Use mine on the pillion seat fastened to the sissy bar on my Road King.  The lumbar support was fantastic.  Just took it to Sturgis, SD, and back, riding about 4300 miles with it.  Large roomy, and with my application, easy to use/secure.  I'd definitely recommend to a friend.
B000GVAFJY|5|It came in a timely manner and was absolutely everything it said it would be. I'm very happy with my new windscreen.
B0049CNX36|2|It's very well made but rattles around too much. I think it should have been made a little thicker for a 2 inch receiver
B00KTHZJ1O|5|Exact match to my factory key fob
B00Q3SHJ1G|5|Settings really good at my tundra I recommend
B00JL7ZSZK|1|Wrong size. Cost too much to ship back.
B005KKWEWC|1|These offer no protection to your hands at all. I put them on a small 70cc bike. My grandson knocked the bike over, not a crash, and the guard broke right off. I'd say the only thing these are good for is looks. Don't waste your money
B00NU6L27G|5|Perfect fit on a 2008 N54 335i. Came with all the bolts and gasket installed and was well packed to prevent damage.
B005O026I0|5|Great mirror
B00EZ7LD46|5|Great kit went together without any problems and sounds great
B0002YR6EW|5|good stuff...i use it for atv tires & front tractor tires...
B00869A60G|5|Very good quality...much better than I thought it would be due to the price.
B00SNF991U|5|Fun to assemble, looks great on top. Helps add character.
B0074SNMZG|1|I received a defective unit.  The letter K is all black from the middle towards the bottom.<br />TERRIBLE
B006RW5NNY|4|Bien!!
B00IQWP50Y|3|It wasn't the size I read on the detailed information
B008QBTOSE|5|Perfect for keeping things neat! These are ideal
B000GU373Q|5|Work great, very strong, can't go anywhere without it.
B003DNL8ZC|4|Great cover protects car from sun damage and over all water.
B00GIXEPFO|3|they look nice wish it was actually metal not plastic
B004LX3AS6|5|I am thrilled with this purchase, it works wonderfully.
B000NK7956|5|Installed easily to my 2009 Pontiac G8
B000HE6ULC|5|Saves the power steering pump in the hot weather
B0068MX2L8|4|Slightly larger than original replacement.
B000BZXS1W|4|Matched these up with Hawk LTS pads on a 1998 XJ Cherokee and I couldn't be happier.  These rotors are well made, were true with no runout.  The E-Coat looks good, though no one will ever see it, and I'm curious to see how long it holds up to the elements.
B00IP2J3EY|5|a
B007C7TAPU|5|Amazing. My 07 Si never stopped this quick before after installing these pads. Instant bite!
B00K889FCI|5|this stuff is amazing ! makes old plastic lenses look new
B005FG64VS|4|Indistinguishable from the OEM lens that it replaced.
B001EAWOE0|1|This product is a joke. Don't waste your time and money.
B00KTHWXYU|5|Prompt Quality
B00GPWG880|1|The pictures shown here on Amazon do not reflect the low quality 'decal' I received. The edges are poorly cut, and the space between the legs is filled with a background color.<br /><br />It is of exceptionally poor quality.
B00252FWIG|5|Perfect replacement on my 07 accord 4dr
B000BUQOFO|4|Very handy no more wood blocks
B0089ACZJC|5|Fits G35X 2005.
B005LZQO7M|4|I bought the closed cap ones without measuring my lug stud length first, my fault this happened but as I tightened them down, the cheap tin caps on top which are glued onto the nut popped right off because my lug studs were too long. They're not as nice as the picture appears but it was my only solution to adapt my Audi style ball seat lug stud wheels to my (originally 60° cone seat lug nut) vehicle.
B00FYX2RF4|2|These fit fine in my 2006 RAV4. But they didn't come with any instructions, just plastic discs and metal hooks. I checked the website, but it only has videos for the slip-cover style, which seemed unnecessary; you slip them on. I invented my own installation, but it was an arduous and irritating task.
B0068ESK1I|5|Very high quality. This is the best choice I found for securing Scooters and Sport Bikes that have fragile paint and plastic body parts. The built in soft loops are a great idea.
B000FOUWNQ|4|Great product, amplified the sound
B000C13UDQ|4|Dfsd
B0001EFSTI|3|Good idea, execution needs work.<br />Bought the Utili-key to replace a Swiss Army knife stolen by the TSA and a small multitool I just plain lost. I wanted a small knife that was less likely to be taken when I inevitably forgot to purge my purse of useful items before air travel.<br /><br />Good: good for opening packages at my mail stop.<br />Travelled without comment when I forgot to remove it.<br />Small, sharp, couple extra features.<br />For about 2 months, it was great - opened easily, but still locked securely.<br /><br />Bad: very hard to open when new, which lasted about 6 months of weekly use. I usually wound up slicing my thumb, like a papercut, most of the time.<br /><br />After about 2 months of perfect tension/ compression, it got so loose it started to fall off my keychain. Then the loop broke.<br /><br />If the locking mechanism were reworked slightly to be both more robust but easier to open I would recommend it heartily. As it is, I recommend it with reservations and advise expecting a year's worth of light duty use before replacing.
B0042OX8WC|5|Worked on my Honda civic 2000 ex 2 door A/T with b16y8 engine.<br /><br />Calibrate it when after you put it on. .48 Closed Throttle ( not pressing gas pedal) and 4.5 at Wide open Throttle (when pushing gas pedal all the way down).<br /><br />Look on youtube on how to do it. Its not hard but will  take some time. An hour to figure everything out and maybe 20 mins to install and calibrate.<br /><br />Jess<br />Amateur Mechanic
B000ET8D1U|5|Great stuff, actually works unlike some cheaper brands. Use it on my bicycle and motorcycles.
B0055B121U|5|If you're replacing a vent valve solenoid on a 2009 Chevy Impala with an ACDelco 214-3218, ignore the automated message that says this part doesn't fit.  It does, and you'll need it.  It's been almost a year since I installed the part, and I haven't had a single problem with it.
B00L1S0JU6|5|Very effective Microfiber drying towel. IN fact better than what im currently using. Would recommend this to my friends and family
B00E65A4DI|1|Good
B005GQ97AC|5|Works great! Helps me park my car in the right spot. Now parking my car in the garage is smooth and easy!!!
B000F1W3PO|5|Good quality. Factory fit and appearance. Great value and would gladly purchase this product again from this supplier. Kudos.
B00E9FDIV0|3|The compass is off center, but if that's your jam then it is perfect for you.
B00T4TEWBQ|4|Had previously purchased a Thule that I liked very much. It looks very similar to this bag. This bag is bigger than the Thule bag. A little larger than I need but it works fine. Used for a 10 day vacation with the grandkids in a mini-van. I put one bag in each row of seats to make it easier for them to discard their trash.
B00UNTU3VO|5|Awesome!
B00HFW5V46|5|Product support great!!
B004EK72TE|1|Not reflective
B00559K8RQ|1|WRONG PART NUMBER -- THE SECOND TIME!  OK, I can understand getting it wrong once, but upon my complaint that the part that arrived was not the one advertised, you'd think they'd get it right the second time. Wrong! I even begged and pleaded that they check the part number before sending it out. Guess someone cannot read numbers. Do not order this part if you have the square shaped fitment. It will not work.  UPDATE. Feb 8, 2016. Having waited half a year, I figured Amazon would get it right this time. I need the 2008 square-holed armrest, exactly as this one is described.  WRONG PART FOR THE THIRD TIME! I even selected from a different Amazon vendor and still got the wrong part. The invoice showed the correct part number, but the box was very clearly marked with a different Toyota number. Do Toyota parts people have trouble reading numbers...or is it an Amazon problem?
B00ABYVT64|5|These are quite possibly the BEST spray bottles I have ever used. I only wish the container was a little bigger because I run out of water quickly with what I have to do. I love the color, I love how easy the water sprays out, and I love the curlyness of the water tube, it allows you to get all the water. Its just a really nice water sprayer
B00CWFZ4HU|5|Works perfect.......
B000BY6HCA|3|Looks good, fit is good, easy to install and folds easily to store behind driver's seat.  Good protection for the inside of car, but don't expect it to reduce the inside temperature.  Bottom line....I would buy again
B000CIFVD6|5|perfect for making brake lines on 1947-54 Chevy trucks
B00J5CVM42|4|Easy to spray on and loosens all the easy stuff so that it can be rinsed off. You still need to use a wheel brush or rag to get the caked on brake dust off of the wheels though. It does make that easier.
B00MB0EXGE|5|I ordered this twice,  however I'am very disappointed that the color on the heels fade too quickly! !# :(
B00WQHMMVK|1|I got this for the cooler portion to bad I never got to use it! Both zippers broke the Frist time I tried to use it. Then the strap broke shortly after. This is junk save your money and buy a slightly more expensive model that won't fall apart!
B00NLOLSMQ|5|Always loved those laser fitted mats.
B006H34BUY|4|It works pretty well, although if you don't give it a good shake outside first, it does leave some dust behind.
B004BSNO8W|1|Sucks! Cheap design connector for connecting manifold gauges or just a hose. With all the environmental concerns, I am shocked this leak prone design is permitted. I personally wasted more refrigerant than I was able to install. Best choice is the style with metal screw on tap for the top of the can.
B000CGMPX2|5|Perfect!
B0048J01RG|4|easy to install. worked great.
B00H4FNXB2|4|Pretty cool solution to the Mustang's notoriously low seatbelt insertion point. Could be a little longer, as the extension isn't that much bigger. Have yet to test the safety certification (thank God), but seems solid and properly built.
B003NHVB1O|5|It was exactly what I needed, it came before it said it was going to, and there was a whole bunch of support in installing them. They come individually packaged with written instructions but if you don't know the anatomy of your truck then they send you a how-to video in your email, which is very useful.
B001MUN57W|3|Starter works great but didn't include gasket
B00G9W9ANG|3|I used this bag on a recent trip to the backcountry for some backpacking.  The seams are already coming apart.  Not the best durability, but it works.  I'm guessing it won't last that long.  It's okay.  And it worked well for compressing my sleeping bag making it easier to pack into the backpack.
B000XEGEWG|5|Mine arrived as expected, in the colors displayed. Mine did not have any lint, even after being put through the washing machine and dryer. They worked awesomely for everything from cleaning iPad screens, cleaning car windows, wiping sand off skin after the beach, and as a washcloth for my sensitive facial skin.
B00HR5YRPU|5|I bought this bumper for my 2015 JK, was super easy to install, took maybe an hour for the bumper. Is constructed very well. Factory fog lights are not compatible, however, If your mechanically inclined you can easily fabricate a mounting system using a piece  of angle sheet metal and bolt them up. The original fog light wiring will reach.
B0002MBDG6|5|nice floormats
B000N2WAMQ|5|Good price. Works well.
B00RH3AMIS|5|They look very sturdy.  I have not had a chance to use them yet, but I'm confident they will work great.
B000IZ3OLE|5|The horn works great but I had to use the wiring from the original horn in order to plug it in. No big deal.
B00YY8E4LA|5|I purchased one of these for my trip to sturgis. Easy to install and looks great. I got plenty of complements and lots of inquiries on where I got it. My. Wife really likes the armrest. Made her feel more secure. Highly recommend this product and Graber Enterprises is a pleasure to work with.
B00HCOECQK|4|Changed these on my 2010 Prius and it solved the clunking sounds in the front suspension.<br />I hope they last a long time.
B00D3YEGO6|5|It looks sooooo good on my Jeep Wrangler 4 door. I LOVE IT!!!
B00IEYDZTC|5|I absolutely love these tires and rims... They are great, they arrived in 2 days, so I got them super fast!, and I put them on and they pull great ... I got 2 tires and rims already mounted for the price of 1 tire here... I will DEFF buy again... And I'll order soon...tks... Todd /GEORGIA USA
B001DOO05S|5|Works great and cheap too
B002GYOSII|5|Bought 4 new ones when I got rims for my 2011 Nissan Altima and Discount tire install them and programmed them for free.
B00GZHC0KU|4|I like it so far.  It's bright white and projects well on my 2002 GMC Sierra 1500HD.  We'll have to see what the life span is.
B000NWA8HU|5|Worked great.  06' Tahoe stereo lights and the DIC (driver info center) on dash would brighten and dim sporadically.  This solved that right away.
B0072RZGP8|4|A bit flimsier than as portrayed on the TV commercial. ALmost perfect fit.
B00RW7W7G4|5|VERY GOOD
B006X8DJCE|1|I've had this grill on my car for maybe 3 months now & use the same car wash as always & the clear coat is gone and the grill now is a dull black & looks like its older than the car itself.
B000C5O1VW|5|my honda 1011 needs this plug and stores don't carry it around me amazon saves the day ngk are the best plugs and last a long time
B000VAODBQ|5|FIts G35X 2005 just fine.
B000VAVDMI|5|The purolator air filter was exactly as expected.  Great quality.
B0037N40EY|5|I'm not sure what more one can say about a knob... It works.  Yea.  ?
B005CLQ3RQ|4|Feels a bit flimsy, but works fine.
B000CEZRHK|5|Works very good it took care of my problema
B00LCFOIVE|5|GREAT!
B00EQ57BE8|1|This unfortunately did not work at all .. Found it out after it was to late to return ..
B00KW0VIZ4|1|Not happy with it and I'm not going to return it it's too much of a hassle forget about it I'll never purchased this again
B00HL1X288|5|Amazing!
B00MOR4CFQ|2|I put these in my 78 VW bus with Hella H4 headlights and everything fit great in the headlight bucket.  They are significantly brighter than the brightest halogen available.  I did have to adjust the headlight's aim down a little bit since they tend to throw the light upward and farther than halogens.  The visibility at night is amazing with these.  I would feel confident to speed down a country road at night with these on because they just make it seem like daylight.  Edit: About 6 months in of regular night driving one of the bulbs started to flicker and eventually ended up at about 1/4 the brightness as before. I would not buy these again.  I'll probably end up going back to power hungry incandescent bulbs in the 100/65 watt flavor.  I'll have to install relays for these, but oh well.
B00SIIWO7I|5|Very Bright light love it!
B00DILTFP4|5|There are so many different brands of wiper blades and so many offerings for each brand that I tend to look for a name I trust rather than shop a list of features.<br /><br />Seven months ago I installed a set of [[ASIN:B00MWNZ51C Bosch 4920 / 3397013040 Insight Wiper Blade - 20\\" (Pack of 1)]] on my vehicle, and they have performed very well through an exceptionally wet winter-spring-summer.  I'm really not seeing degradation in performance as evidenced by streaking or skipping, but I'm still glad to trade them after heavy snows/slush and then so many rain days.  (I've found I don't actually notice a problem until streaking/skipping issues are pretty bad.)<br /><br />I am seeing zero change with these new Bosch SteelTech, and that's a good thing.  Aesthetically, I think I like the looks of the Insights a little better, but if the tension spring on this new blade performs anywhere near as well as the old, that will make it an excellent value:  the SteelTech at this writing sells on Amazon for less than half the price of the Insight.<br /><br />A hint about sizing - being tension spring driven, these wipers will contour very well to a reasonably flat windshield, and I've found that while the 20\\" - in my case - is standard for my car, I can easily size down to a 19\\" or 18\\" if 20 is not in stock.  If I'm going to fudge that, I still want to find at least one 20\\" blade for the driver side, and I wouldn't sacrifice more than an inch or two on the passenger side for safety's sake.  But it's nice to know that I have some flexibility if I find stock of \\"my size\\" to be low.
B000182DWE|4|so far there are good visors. not as great as my last ones but I would recommend them.
B00JF53ZEE|5|This Cargo Carrier is light-weight and super solid 30lbs only. It is pretty application for the small vehicle, such as a prius, with 1 1/4 hitch tow. My wife (100lbs) can install to the hitch by herself. The curved 2 Inch adjustment Increments increase the elevation and clearance, however, I do not recommend put too much weight on the tray. It states 300lbs max on the instruction that I do not believe the mesh grill will handle well on the welding edge. The visibility of carrier is bad at night compared to the aluminium. Thus, I use the 3M Yellow Reflective Tape to create strikes pattern on the edge. 3M is a must, because the adhesive is 10x stronger than normal brand name.  Updated - 10/19/2015 We finished a 7 days road trip from east coast to west coast. Four people, full trunk, plus towing four boxes by CURT 18110 Cargo Carrier,  3850 miles, 7 days, our little Plug-in Prius made all the way from VA to TN to KY to MO to KS to CO to WY to MT to ID to NV and to CA!!
B00AKEVNP2|5|Great product.
B0007N20GM|5|An excellent product that is hard to find, since the new toll tag holders available in auto parts stores, are for the new smaller toll tags.
B00B5L5QJ8|1|Okay.... Re-installed 3 times now. Cleaned terminals. No start. Truck is stuck now. Great.
B00KTHXO2U|5|Worked as promised.
B00VELE71W|5|Holy Crap this thing if BRIGHT!!  Very nice, lights up the whole area in front of you.  It came with wiring harness and switch, everything you need to mount to a bumper.  You might need different brackets to mount to a windshield pillar.  I have had no issues with moisture, this thing is solid, seems pretty rugged, and did I mention it is BRIGHT.  I haven't compared it to high dollar light bars, but I believe this will hold up to one of those, for much less price.
B007NU0FOQ|5|Awesome to have and a great attention grabber
B00RCEJQV6|5|Beautiful & fit like a glove.
B00E4CQGVW|5|Nice
B00BYH6C1E|2|Does not fit my car. Way to big to fit in between seat and console.
B00AMLQ8VW|5|These are very nice bars. The only thing that someone needs to know involves installation. The rear brackets need to be installed on opposite sides of the truck.
B000FOUB8M|2|Just like others have stated, this thing is a bear to get the spread right.  I thought I could outsmart this bar and figure a way to set it right but minus marking this thing up with lines and numbering it and numbering the bed of your truck in different areas for different spread widths on the bar, you'll fight this thing several times to get it right.  It seems well made but within a short amount of time, it was already rusting.  And sure it has good holding power but on the flip side of that, you can spread the bed of your truck apart because of the leverage of the device.  That's why it is critical to get the setting right and what aggreviates me about it the most.  It's either to loose and it won't hold or it spreading the bed and I'm not taking a risk of having my bed accrueing damage because I won't spend the extra minute fine tuning the setting.  Most of the time I set it at a slight diagonal so I'm not fighting the thing (as long as the item im hauling isn't critcal or heavy). I think I rather have a racket style, but all the ones I seen that were reviewed had poor build quality by the customers review.  I'm waiting for the best of both worlds and would be willing to spend the money for high quality and convenience.  If you're in a real need for one, I would just buy one, but if you're not, keep looking or wait for something better.
B00LLLS5FE|1|Internals don't fit right on the inside
B00EC2CG9U|5|The perfect size for what I needed and very sturdy.
B009LP4D3K|5|Timely delivery, easy installation.
B0010DXYH2|5|Good fix to replace engine air filter. Second time purchasing this.
B0058TVYSK|4|Not roomy at all
B004RNOVTM|5|Great quality, great length for my needs and quick delivery!
B00DJBQ1SW|5|Great.  Sturdy and well made.
B00F6XAHLI|5|Perfect fi, came quickly, it was just what I was looking for.
B00K23V1A8|4|Great product but had to weld it to my buddy club spec 3 exhaust. Not sure if they sell a bolt on but that would've been better.
B000NJ4QXK|5|Es mejor de lo que Esperanza.  Is better them expected.
B00SXE4GI2|5|Nice cover. Well made.
B007Z1FSKO|1|I purchased 2 sets of wings for my 2015 Genesis sedan customers.  They waited anxiously for a week, only to find out the wings would not stick to the trunk. I found this out after taking the original emblem off. I was in a very bad situation.  Will never buy these products again. All the contact information on the package was in Chinese. ..no help at all!
B001GJ3FIS|5|Many options, all work great.
B00YI3IGA6|5|The y are the best they are simple to put and my kids love it
B00CYU8UKG|2|They might not work with your car:  even though they claim they do.
B00F359R60|5|works
B00CPYFOVY|5|Dorman parts are as good as OEM
B00GHT8TSI|2|This reservoir fit fine in my 2005 Suburban, BUT...the hole for the fluid level sensor/float assembly was almost 1/2&#34; too high so I could NOT install the sensor, which meant the reservoir was completely worthless.
B0065766DM|5|Great Quality
B00MBPTC7E|5|Had to trim top and bottom just a little to got a 1992 GMC but looks good.
B00RUCAGBO|5|Works excellent. Though descrition didn't say the antenna mount was extra. Still happy with item.
B0001CMUV4|4|The stowaway hitch tighter arrived ahead of schedule and worked great to stop the rattle. I would have given it five stars but unfortunately on the first use it picked up some road debris in the threads and nut locked up when I was taking it off. I tried working it back and forth but to no avail, the threads stripped out.
B001KOFY9C|5|works perfect, fits shoes and a change of clothes
B007HRR31S|5|Exactly as described, direct replacement. Identical to the original.
B00X64GT6Q|1|Ordered this pump thinking it was an original equipment replacement pump, which it is not. Upon receiving I noticed the box was different from what was advertised, it actually said &#34;ACDelco Advantage&#34;. Had some comical instructions on the box stating it was for use on vehicles operating in Mexico and the Caribbean. Do yourself a favor and check the part numbers Bgv00386 is not an ACDelco part number, per the ACDelco website. Interestingly though this part number can actually be found on Alibaba and is simply a Chinese knockoff of the Ep386 fuel pump. Seller made the return hassle free, which I can appreciate. It needs to be stated more clearly though that this pump is an aftermarket replacement and is not an original equipment part, advertising is a little misleading.
B00H72YFTG|5|Towels are soft, thick, and absorbent.
B00W8ADB1K|5|I looked at just about every car organizer listed on Amazon and decided to buy this one, I'm glad I did. This organizer is just what I was looking for! It doesn't have an excess amount of pockets and that's fine because I do not want to overload it with stuff that I don't need to carry. It's perfect and flips right around to the back when you have a passenger. I love it!
B000X21DJM|5|very good turbo timer. have worked flawlessly for the last 5 or so years
B000CSRA3K|5|Good quality for the best price
B00AWTX42K|5|Fits and works great.
B003UVCY00|5|Amazing
B00XLV0D84|4|Great work nicely
B0085IH3CW|1|Bought these and installed on my RV. Blew out less than 400 miles.  Not recommended.
B000C2AFJW|3|Item as advertised. Took a over a week to receive.
B0034ZO8CY|5|Very nice item and adds better performance than stock filter
B001447VB2|5|Love this product! I mainly use it on my chrome tail pipes to get the nasty black residue off. Leaves them shiny!
B000CRCW8E|5|Perfect fit and great timing
B000ZSTXAU|5|Nice quality
B0038AAW16|5|works great &#62;&#62; Thank you
B00AQIL05A|4|It fit perfectly.  I do wish it stated the color in the description.
B00KBINF7G|1|Bought this late last year. Used it a few times in the winter to start snow mobiles and my truck once. Tried to charge it this summer, it won't hold a charge. When it's plugged in blue light flashes but nothing when unplugged. Very disappointed. Had it way less then a year but it's non returnable.
B005G5R5LQ|5|great
B0071NAX3I|5|My billet grill was bent to pieces when the Victorville overzealous SWAT team knocked down my white wood picket fence / gate. (Dispute over a battery allegedly taken from Rite Aid!) Security guard claimed not only did I steal a battery (singular!) but I threatened him with a gun / or going home to get a gun = felony criminal-terrorist threats @ felony .<br />Back the the present: YOUR grill fits perfectly. (I believe I ordered my other grill from you.) Excellent. Arrived promptly.<br />GREAT JOB.<br /><br />Since I accidentally ordered two--how do I return the brand new duplicate grill?<br />Captain Dan Stillmunks<br />15555 Main St.<br />D-4 #144<br />Hesperia, CA 92345<br />U.S.A.<br />captaindandandan@Gmail.com
B000I4JPZE|5|Wish I'd had this years ago.
B0002Z9QO4|4|I drive from North Carolina to Nebraska and back, through heavy rain and it was excellent. I knew there was a chance that it might get damp with rain so I wrapped my luggage in a drop cloth but it stayed dry.
B008BC8EW0|5|So much better than the sock mirrors.
B008G3A28S|5|Look great and durable
B00684TJ9U|5|Is really easy program
B00E9HWS9G|5|Exactly what I wanted for my SUV.
B0002UEMZ2|5|It's glue that works...
B00B4S2D52|5|Perfect fit for our older model Toyota!
B0085PFUSO|2|Doesn't fit correctly. I had to shift the steering rack assembly because after installing the header the steering wheel joint bolt would rub real bad to the point where you can't turn the steering wheel.
B00J62ZKBC|5|Fit my 2003 Frontier Crew Cab short-bed perfectly.
B00H242NNY|5|These taps are as handy as a pocket on a shirt....simple to use and makes a very good connection.  I use them on my motorcycle with great results.  I've never had a connection fail.  I do apply a little silicone grease at the time I'm making the connection.  Use these taps and forget about them!
B00BCKKEQC|5|Bought 3 to replace the dead ones in my neuton CE6 mower.  Have used and recharged them several times and they consistently show over 40v for my 36v pack.  I use the neuton smart charger and they charge in 4 to 10 hours and last over an hour constant mowing time in tall, damp grass.  great price, fast shipping, good packaging.  Costs less than half of what the factory pack would cost.
B004J9GZZC|4|Easy install. worked great
B003G9FZHA|5|Wanted a spare readily available after a friend had one burn out and had difficulty finding a replacement while camping.
B001N2O3PM|5|Perfect, exactly as expected
B000CQ26JA|5|Great product at a good price! Tows a 6 ton trailer no problem..
B001PYV0XG|5|Perfect fit and easy to install for my Mazda b2600.
B00YOJ2FSS|4|This part was an exact OEM replacement.  It works but the package had been previously opened.  The seal was broken.
B002DZJQ0A|5|Works great!
B002P8HNH8|5|Awesome. Perfect fit, great match to passenger window mirror.
B002VFH5J6|1|Had to return it. The pleats in the filter were all messed up and the material looked really flimsy/cheap - even for a paper filter.
B008V6QVA8|5|I got this to replace some old chain that I was using on my car trailer and it works great, plenty of length, and fair price.
B00230MXIW|3|Very Nice item and good price to boot
B000VLF990|5|Fits my '06 perfectly!
B00LJYBLMC|5|Fits my Nissan
B000JFN9WW|5|This machine works like a charm. Forget about the instruction manual, you don't need it. It's pretty self explanatory. It works like a normal vacuum cleaner. One end plugs in for power, the other end sucks up what you want to dispense. SIMPLE! On top of being simple, this thing does its job very well. I bled my entire brakes system in less the 20 minute. I also purchased the mityvac refill kit, to keep the master cylinder filled with fluid as I sucked all the old fluid through the bleeder screw at each brake caliper. Make sure you use some Super Lube on the bleeder screw adapter, in order to insure an air tight fit and proper lubrication. Once it's on the bleeder screw and the vacuum valve is open, you won't have to worry about it coming off. The vacuum is sufficient enough. The very next day, I bled my clutch master cylinder as well, in a matter of minutes. Once again, using the refill kit to insure that the master cylinder reservoir was never empty. Mityvac offer a brake bleeding kit, that comes with a refill kit... But it is $160+. Purchasing this vacuum and the refill kit separately, will save you $40... You're Welcome! Even if you don't plan on doing this for a living (which you can once you have all the tools), you'll save a lot of money investing in something like this and doing it yourself. There are plenty of YouTube videos on how to do this properly on any vehicle, if not, all vehicles. You get the satisfaction of knowing it was done, done correctly and you can pat yourself on the back. This maintenance is a MUST at certain intervals, if you plan on keeping your vehicle a significant amount of time. Due to the corrosive nature of hydraulic fluid, it can do some damage if left in the system for too long and not replaced. Check your owners manual for the proper mileage/time intervals. Just cause you don't drive your car much at all, doesn't mean this maintenance can be overlooked. You will not be disappointed with this product. I promise you that. This is the pneumatic one, so be sure you own an air compressor. I own an 8 gallon air compressor with a max psi of 150, it does the job just fine. Enjoy!e pneumatic one, so be sure you own an air compressor. I own an 8 gallon air compressor with a max psi of 150, it does the job just fine. Enjoy!
B00AB3HC98|5|A good fit for my Cross Trek . And it comes with a nice case to store it in
B0010GEPWW|5|i will always keep my truck factory installed parts as long as i can. cheaper than the dealer? no problem very happy with the item thanks guys.
B001NZMZ5E|5|Fits just as well as OEM on 2010 Acura TL SH-AWD. Sealing gasket seems like it might be better quality than OEM. Car seems to have better throttle response (but that may just be my perception). Good price.
B0042A2V88|5|Good Deal!
B00VAZMARU|4|Does the job. Good wrench at a great price.
B001DCC322|5|Worked great, the price was right very happy with quality of product.
B006N9HYLA|5|Ok
B00CLCCM56|5|Nice shift knob
B000WEKMVG|4|Good buy .
B00JPJW26M|5|Exactly the replacement I needed.
B00M78820I|5|Easy to use product and really does help keep the car cooler. I recommend them totally.  The delivery and follow up was exceptional!
B010CA65P6|2|My seats where looking a little worn so I thought I would try them out for $40.<br /><br />The rear bottom cover fits decent, but the back is terrible. The front bucket covers are ok, but due to the design of the top of the seats they have a huge air space behind them. Stitching is not very good either. When tightening the nylon straps, a couple of the buckles tore out of the seams. Also, one edge of the passenger seat tore when I sat in them to test them out.<br /><br />The smell of the material may bother some. It is not your standard vinyl smell. It may go away, but only time will tell.<br /><br />I definitely would not recommend these for a Grand Pix, but may fit decent on a vehicle. Just be careful tightening the straps.
B005FM24WK|5|I am really satisfied withe quality of this product and the film was professionally packed.  However, it took forever for the package to arrive, and i was hesitant to give it 4 star just becouse of that.
B0065UNOX4|5|Received in Timely Manner.  Well Pleased!
B005JVSH9G|5|This is &#34;one smart vent!&#34; installed it on my custom shed/ mini-cottage. Keeps the interior temp reasonable inside durring summer months.<br />Will circulate heat in winter.Fantastic when connected to power flex solar mat & battery<br />Self powered...thermostat controled...auto shut!
B00008RW9U|5|Perfect for car and motorcycle.
B00G8PBLXQ|5|Very stylish
B00JO9ZIA0|5|I'm very satisfied with my purchase. Worth every cent and the lowest price. Fit perfectly on my Volkswagen.
B008ANT9LK|5|Exactly as expected and promised. Delivered in original packaging.
B000UHD74E|3|Some benefits, but didn't cure the problem
B00M77T82K|5|The silicone is very rigid and sturdy and upon heatsoak, does not get soft. Will buy again.
B00IKJ9GP8|5|The correct struts were delivered on time, the quality seemed excellent, and I had no difficulty with the installation.
B00DDVO3OC|5|Put them on they work good. Looked for rear pads and rotors from Emil (should have just got rear, front were fine) could not find any.
B00BVDX76E|5|Well made and looks almost like the real military base entrance decals. I decided to stick mine on my Jeep. It's easy to apply inside the windshield of any vehicles and can be remove and stick to another vehicles.
B000BZN4TS|3|Not fit very well!
B00LKZN7IG|2|NOU
B00B4C5LZ2|5|This kayak holder worked well on my floating dock.  I'm very pleased with it.  I did not need Dock slde receivers since I was not installing this on a Dock Side floater.
B008OK0O54|5|Thank you
B00AESWKHO|4|were just as described, worked great
B000CO66I4|5|Excellent pads.  Matched them up with Centric rotors on a 1998 XJ Cherokee.  You could really feel the pads start to grab during the bedding procedure, and the final braking performance is excellent both on and off road.
B00X0G30MQ|5|This is easy to attach to a clean window surface.I love the double looks that I get when the car next to me sees it!
B0002SRH5G|5|Works Great, Saves time purging  air from cooling system
B001FNNVMU|1|Mine came with NO carb stick waste of money without the sticker I'm not happy with that considering they said it was Included
B00M0CQREY|5|Although I didn't receive any mounting instructions for my 2014 Ram Chrome 3rd brake light cover, I was able to mount it very quickly, and, &#34;almost&#34;, picture perfectly!  It really enhances the back of my pickup, thanx!  Also, I received it 2, or, 3, days earlier than expected!  Again, thanx!
B00029JMLC|5|Great improvement and perfect match with MSD 6A on my MR2 SW20 turbo. Improve torque at low rpm and quick response. High rpm come up more quickly.
B002G1PBW8|5|Fit perfect and arched originals.
B00KTLLZWW|5|excelen
B0081GL2OI|5|Easy to install
B00JUQFVX6|3|One of the pockets frayed and ripped after a few months. I don't even know how
B00H6XPZN6|4|It worked exactly as advertised and kept my car cooler.
B003YC8EGS|5|Perfect.
B0031BI23W|4|Could be better but for the money it works pretty well.
B008FCE7ZO|1|I don't know why anyone needs extra bars for a roof rack that needs a whole rack - I thought all I needed was slot bars for my new GM Traverse, but not so !  Very dissatisfied !!!
B006FXHJ0K|5|I ordered these and never got<br />.... But jeff smith there helped me and got me another set free! And there awesome looking on my focus! 5*****
B000CFS028|5|Have hailed multiple sheet goods and studs, 20+ bags of mulch, etc., without any sagging in our 2008 Sienna (yep, minivan) - amazing how controlled the ride is with a heavy load.  Pulled a piano across Texas in a Uhaul trailer and forgot it was back there.<br /><br />A little involved in installing, but well worth the time & effort.  Amazing the difference a few lbs of air can do.
B000N5ST3C|5|Good Battery has higher AH then the factory battery (BMW). A few friends used the same battery and last longer.
B00XKH0C4O|5|works as listed
B000EBMCQ0|5|excellent bumper guard, not to heavy or cheesey excellent product
B00ADWGLR6|2|Cheaply made. The letters are plastic glued to the material. and started falling off before one year of use.
B009I456NU|4|Look nice and very easy to install, very solid, have had a 16 cu ft cargo carrier and an 18' kayak on at the same time with no issues, a fair bit of howling at highway speed but so easy to remove just pull them off if not using them, for this price I'm willing to put up with a little wind noise
B0045WBVUM|5|Will never ride without one again. What a difference!!
B0001L0DFA|5|Great !
B005Q13BI6|5|Exellant
B00JXYHXCC|5|perfect! everything i needed and fast..
B007KEVN00|5|I love my ARB air compressor!  It works very well and I use it often to reinflate my tires on my Jeep each time I finish with an off road experience.  I would not be without this compressor.
B004Q820UK|5|I have used Battery Tender (Deltran) products for years without a single complaint. They are simple, straight forward, affordable, and they do exactly what they say. I use these solar controllers with small solar panels to keep my winch batteries charged in my race car trailers. Simple to hook up and mount. Small enough to put anywhere. Convenient charge indicator lights, so you know the status of your battery. Once installed, you can forget about remembering to plug in a traditional charger during long term storage. Highly recommended.
