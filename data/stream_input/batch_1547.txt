B0088BSG40|5.0|I was certain that Those Whom the Gods Detest was going to be the peak of Nile's songwriting career. I listened to it and was stoked about it's quality, but was also sad to think it won't get any better. Well, I was wrong. Nile has stepped up to the plate and smashed the ball right through YOUR FACE! This is the most technical songwriting I've ever heard. Sure there are bands like Origin, but really... that stuff isn't all that catchy. I've read a lot of complaints about the production of this album ATGOS. RUBBISH! Production is awesome. All the riffs are so complex that if they were to have stuck with their typical ultra bassy sound a lot of notes would be inaudible. Also it makes a huge difference if you buy the actual CD, not the MP3 because I'm always impatient about waiting on mail order and always download the songs to get a taste. But seriously, don't be cheap. Get the CD. It's full of linear notes and cool artwork, including the art that is the cover to the import version. Guitar and drums don't get this good. Now I'm wondering again if this is their best? Nile will have to work super hard to top this.
B007ZRZF8I|5.0|this is an awsome game fun fast and cool graphics. most phone games suck. I am glad that I downloaded this game.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Fast and fun! Some levels are challenging and others you just breeze through. A mix of a maze and a logic problem. Give it a try if you like either.
B000NGTJTY|1.0|I was told this was about Irish Catholics in Boston and so I thought it would an ideal program to show the family on Sunday morning.  WELL!!!  I was very surprised to find a great deal of profanity and violence in a film billed as a Catholic film for children.  Poor little Daphne was horrified by all the blood and has refused to come out of her room for the last week.  She sobs and sobs and can't believe that the same man who was in \\"Titanic\\" would ever lower himself to this level.  Neither can I.  Parents -- avoid at all costs!  I fear that Daphne will now get bulimia and live a shortened life.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|you can't get of the game once u are done playing it without turning the device off. I wouldn't waste your time.

B008F5YDRI|4.0|I didn't know what to expect from this movie but it was an enjoyable romantic movie, that wasn't over the top.  It had a few laughs and each character was well done. I especially liked the Sheikh's character.
B00007E7K0|5.0|This cap is great, its the exact same one that came with my T2i, I have had no issues with it at all.
B0083GPDBO|4.0|Interesting - they made the camera the main character. :) This movie had me on the edge of my seat, and the character evolution (not of the camera but of the human characters) added just a little (a very little) depth to this chiller.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|I loved the 1st 2 Christian Bale/Christopher Nolan Batman films.  Absolutely loved them.  I think that both and the Dark Knight for sure could have been Best Picture Oscars in their years.  I mean, 7 Academy Award winners/nominees in each film!  How many films can say that!  But the Dark Knight Rises in a class all of it's own.<br /><br />I ADORE movies.  I have over 1000 DVDs/Blu Rays in my collection.  I have everything from silent films through today and I love them all in their own ways.  I think that I can honestly say that I am an amateur expert on movies.<br /><br />I believe that the Dark Knight Rises is the best action film that I have ever seen.<br /><br />It has EVERYTHING in it.  Great action from the very beginning to the very end.  A terrific story and again, 6 Academy Award winners/nominees so 'nuff said about the acting!<br /><br />I'm just afraid that it will forever be tainted by the evil nut from Colorado.
B0085HWZ9Y|5.0|I bought this on a whim... I have the CD and liked it.  I've been a long time Patty Griffin fan.  What I had forgotten is that BUDDY MILLER was prt of this band.  And then add to the mix the stellar Darrell Scott playing his butt off of every instrument with the backing of Byron House on bass and Marco Giovino on drums and you a mix of well... PURE JOY!  When I put it on, I thought I'd listen to a few cuts in the background as I did some work...  Well that didn't happen.  I was MESMERIZED!  This is a such a good disc, yes there are a few interview bits thrown in as one reviewer says, however they honestly don't bother me.  Robert appears to be genuinely joyful about being on the stage with the players he's chosen.  His respect for their talent is obvious in that he showcases them in a number of places even giving them the stage for their own songs.  Highly recommended for lovers of music.  It does not matter if you like Zeppelin or not, these are NOT your parents Zeppelin songs... these swing AND rock.  So glad I bought this and will enjoy it over and over.  I sure hope this band puts out another cd.  Robert?
0345803507|2.0|I'll admit the first book got me hooked, but by the second one I was getting a little disturbed with Christian's controlling and possessive behavior with Ana.  However I decided to finish out the series because I was curious to see how it ended.<br />Here are my gripes:<br /><br />1)  Ana sometimes tries to stick up for herself, but I feel that she is always walking on eggshells with Christian and constantly apologizing to him<br /><br />2)  Christian flips out over the most trivial of things, it borders on emotional abuse.<br /><br />3) The sex scenes seem redundant, I actually just skimmed those pages.  And I find it a bit unrealistic that Ana seems to be having orgasms at the drop of a hat.<br /><br />4)  A lot of the dialogue seems cheesy.<br /><br />5) the inner goddess thing is overused!

B004LWZWGK|5.0|The Dark Knight Rises closes out the greatest superhero trilogy ever. This is a film, not a movie. It makes Avengers look like a poor man's Transformers 3. The ending is perfect and is nice to see a superhero saga with a definitive ending that really works. Bane is a scary Darth Vader-equse brute and Anne Hathaway steals every scene she is in as Catwoman. Dark, rich, and unforgettable, the Dark Knight Rises is a emotionally harrowing finale that gives the caped crusader a nice-send off.
B006H8BIIM|1.0|I purchased the complete station upgrades for .99.  I thought that was a fair deal.  When I opened the game today, there was a pop up saying all station upgrades have been reset.  I could only tap a check box to close it. I went into the upgrade section of the game and sure enough, my past upgrades were all gone.  In their place I had a paltry 320 credits and zero power ups.  Don't waste your time or money.
B007X4ECLY|2.0|As a fan of sci-fi, action, space, Luc Besson and a bunch of other elements, I was hoping that the mediocre reviews of this movie were a bit out of whack.  Disappointingly not so - Guy Pearce is just perfect in this role, and the writing of his character is excellent, but it does nothing to save this poor effort of a movie.<br /><br />This isn't really a 'leave your brain at the door' experience, it's just a ridiculous story with moment after moment that is just beyond implausible.  Even accepting the silly premise, you still have things in most scenes that make you roll your eyes - the screenwriting uses the most basic devices and almost everything is a leap of faith which stretches way too far very early on.  And then there's Maggie Grace, playing a helpless daughter that needs to be rescued... really?<br /><br />Honestly, not worth it, even if you love sci-fi and action and don't mind silly fun.
B004G5ZY7E|5.0|I came upon this book by chance. I found it  very entertaining and enjoyable. The name of some of the characters were confusing but once into the story it all became clear. I am planning to read all of this authors books
B008MEM24S|5.0|I really enjoy these kind of games and would recommend it to anyone! I have hours of fun with it and &quot; where's my water.&quot;
B004LWZWGK|5.0|It's been 4 years since The Dark Knight came out, and while only time will tell if this movie will live up to the ridiculously high standards set by fans of the franchise, one thing that is indeed for Sure is that The Dark Knight Rises is seriously awesome. A long time fan of Batman, I haven't missed a single opening day of Btman, and last night I decided not to break that tradition. The minute the tickets went on sale a month ago, I frantically pulled out my Blackberry and opened the cineplex app, frantically hitting the \\"reload\\" button nonstop and finally got ahold of IMAX midnight premiere tickets, and while the wait for the midnight show was long and torturous, it was worth every single hour of the wait.<br /><br />Now I consider myself to be a rare breed, one of the few who prefer Batman Begins to The Dark Knight. Don't get me wrong, I love The Dark Knight to pieces, but it's always been about the comic book feel and how Batman and Bruce Wayne continue their inner battle against himself for me. I mean, while I love TDK, there's too much Bruce Wayne for me, and it's more of a Christopher Nolan action thriller than Batman. So I hoped that TDKR would deliver... in short, it did.<br /><br />Eight years have passed since Batman took the blame for Harvey Dent's horrible crimes. Bruce Wayne is disgraced, shamed, and living in reclusion, with exceptionally poor health. Since Harvey Dent died, an Anti-crime act named after his belief in cleaning up the streets has been put in place, and a Harvey Dent day has been put in place to honor his beliefs.  However, that can't last; a sexy but mysterious jewel thief named Selina Kyle, with feline tendencies, has been wreaking havoc in Gotham and even worse, a terrorist named Bane has arrived in Gotham, and has an underground army who are planning a tyrannical nightmare of a plan that will turn Gotham into gangland territory. This means Bruce Wayne has to come out ofnhiding and return as Gotham's caped crusader for once and for all!<br /><br />Man, I couldn't have asked for a better finale to the series. This film pulls the blockbuster out of its comfort zone and gives us something that feels so intimate, yet so grand scale. The action is big, epic, and bombastic, yet the drama is intimate, up close and personal. And another part that made it so great: comic book Batman is back! While the dark and grim tone is still there, the tongue in cheek, quirky comic book feel is inthe air, specifically during Batman and Catwoman's scenes. Mind you, Heath Ledger's Joker isn't around, and Bane is the villain but up to 11 with the brutality and minus the wit and comic charm, so we're relying on Catwoman for those sparks of verbal wit, and it does work... Way better than it should, even! And the villain. Bane. He is one scary mofo. He can snap someone's spine in half like a lobster without even any effort. The mask he wears is terrifying and as a result, your heart fills with fear and dread every time he shows up.<br /><br />Another reason to see this movie is the IMAX cinematography. It's an ultimate sin to miss this in IMAX. 72 minutes of the movie were shot with IMAX cameras, and it helps enhance it much more. They're not just for big set pieces like TDK, they help enhance the narrative of the film. Without a doubt the most interesting use of the IMAX cameras is the fight scene in the sewer between Bane and Batman. No music, violent and brutal, and a few shots where Bane's all, terrifying image fills the 8 story screen just make for one of the most memorable scenes in recent memory.<br /><br />Never has Batman been done this much justice, and thank Nolan for finally getting Batman exactly right. I felt like a kid during several scenes, like Bat riding his batpod through the tunnel, the Batjet scenes, well practically the whole film,  and overall I was overwhelmed with that childlike happiness and joy- the batman I always wanted to see had finally unfolded before my eyes.<br /><br />Do not miss this film... You will regret missing it!lm... You will regret missing it!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games was far better than I had expected. I decided to buy it due to popularity & price. Not sorry I bought it . I also downloaded 2nd & 3rd books to my kindle.
B008N1V11U|5.0|This is the best Batman game you can get on mobile devices now. Better than Lego Batman and Lego Batman 2 for portables. And it blows Arkham City Lockdown out of the water.  Open world enviornment not as big as NYC in The Amazing Spider-Man, but still big.  Combat is very Markham like, and you can even perform stealth takedowns.  Locomotion is great as well.  You can glide from Point A to Point B, and also ride the fricking Tumbler and the Bat-Pod (Bat-Cycle). All in all, great game.  Must buy!
B008MEM24S|5.0|This game is too fun and I'm an adult! Love the puzzle solving.  It's not too hard but not too easy.
0062515608|5.0|Through an interesting story, Sharma gives us a basic guide to human and spiritual values.<br />It's understandable if some people do not accept it. When you are guided by materialism and hedonism you will not like this book that makes you see the greatest things in life which are not necessarily money, pleasure and power.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is awesome I play it all the time its it starts easy then gets challenging when you continue to play it. Its a fun challengeing game for everyone.
B0000508U6|5.0|I've got most of their CDs, but this one is still the best to me.  Good variety on this CD, the songs feel like they were written with a lot of thought and heart.  I wish the \\"Parachutes\\" track was longer - good song, interesting.

B008GXHOFW|4.0|This game has great gameplay and I love the free new York aspect. The only problems are the random restarts of your game and occasional freezing. overall it's probably worth the 7 dollars.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|we all love playing the game and glad to see the game be able to change over time. The kids like the interaction. the best.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|on kindle fire works great! At first u might think it is a waste of time and space but it realy isn't. you use more than you think. tells u how much longer to play music games go in the Internet and lets u know how much longer to charge it.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is a very good read! The plot is interesting and the characters are well developed. I don't really consider this book appropriate for young or sensitive readers because the book is very violent. Definitely, this book is the best in the series. It also ends with a cliff-hanger so you'll need to read the trilogy!
0143123173|5.0|I watched the series and decided to try the book (which is generally better) and I was right.  It's a \\"cannot put it down\\" book.  Loved every page.  The characters are so real and the setting are so descriptive.  It was 107 degrees outside when I was reading this novel and grabbed a throw as Longmire trudged through the snow.  I was there!  A must read!
B008DB3N5W|2.0|Yeah, this album is going to get some bad reviews, and it mostly deserves it. It is not a BAD album, because we all know we've heard much worse--but by Manowar standards, this is probably their worst full-length LP, at least upon first impression. I'll get into some of the reasons why in a moment.<br /><br />What is strange is that this comes off the heels of THUNDER IN THE SKY: which I thought was the best thing they've done since Triumph of Steel. Fantastic songs, great performances with real feeling, and some of the best production value I've heard in a metal album in a long, long time. The thing kicked ass, and that little EP is probably the antithesis to this in all the ways I mentioned.<br /><br />I think there are a few main problems on this. First is that the album is simply boring. I listened to the first half of it and stopped because, aside from the great first track, everything was plodding, paint-by-numbers. The tracks weren't necessarily bad, they were just completely mediocre. Only at the very end does the album pick up, and then only a little. I had the same initial feeling for Warriors of the World, but the worst tracks there are on par with most of the better tracks here, and when that album kicked ass it really did so. This one is just uninspired and bland. It has been described as \\"simplistic, back-to-basics\\", perhaps in response to Gods of War, but not in a good way, it is simplistic and bland in a rather uninspired way, not unlike Metallica's St. Anger.<br /><br />The second is the production quality. The songs are written boringly, but the album sounds boring too. I thought my EQ settings were wrong at first and spent a good ten minutes playing around with my system trying to fix the problem before I realized it was just the way the album is. People complain about Joey's bass tone, and while it is a bit distracting, I kind of liked that super-overdriven buzzy sounding tone, it could be mixed a bit lower but it sounds fine to me, and at least he tried something new. That's not the problem. The problem is everything else. The guitar is too low, Eric Adams sounds gruff and processed, and poor Donnie, the drums have absolutely no kick to them. That, for me, is the main problem. Thunder in the Sky and the redone Battle Hymns sounded AMAZING, and they both had huge drum bass. Here, every ounce of bass in the mix is dedicated to Joey's bass guitar, and it flattens everything out while simultaneously having that dull full-bass-the-entire-song kind of sound. Manowar's last albums from Warriors of the World to Battle Hymns 2011 sounded amazing, and powerful. This is a bit of a mess. The album has great clarity and fidelity, but it just sounds really weak and unbalanced. It is hard to exactly put your finger on.<br /><br />The final problem is that there seems to be little passion here. Joey does okay, but the guitars are kinda meh and the solos seem a bit incoherant, the drumming, if you can hear it, is simple and uninspired, and Eric Adams gives a painfully bad performance and sounds like he is phoning it in. The guy is such a great singer, and you only need to listen to Battle Hymns 2011 or Thunder in the Sky to see this lineup at their finest. Perhaps because the songs were so bland no one could find the passion for this. Something just isn't quite working the way it normally does.<br /><br />All in all, if you are a Manowar fan, you will listen to this, and it is worth one listen for curiosity. Some will like it, many probably out of psychological obligation to like everything they do, but let's be honest: this is not a particularly good album. And it's not like they are past their prime or incapable of innovating. I loved Gods of War, a severely unfairly criticized album, it was bold and daring and took the band to new territory, with complex songs and an entertaining production. What happened here? The same thing that happens to bands sometimes. They simply made a poor album. It happens. The next one will probably put them right on track. It's a shame they just didn't add two or three songs to Thunder in the Sky and release that as an LP, and whittle this mess down to the best four songs and put this out as a bonus EP. Oh well.<br /><br />I gave this album 2 stars but I really wanted to give it 2.5. It does sound a bit harsh to give it two, but I don't think it is quite deserving of 3. As I said it is not out and out terrible, but it's quite poor by Manowar standards. The bottom line was that it just did nothing for me. I will, however, say that I suspect that this album may grow on me a little. Worthwhile songs: Lord of Steel, Born in a Grave, Touch the Sky, El Gringo, Annihilation. (You see? It's just an average EP with tons of filler! =bad LP)<br /><br />But you know, I am sure Manowar is listening to some of this feedback, so maybe they will tweak it a bit for the CD version. As I said, the mixing is a bit weird, and I suspect there is a better album in there trying to get out, but if mixing was the only problem on here we'd be in okay shape. Listen to Dawn of Battle and Thunder in the Sky and then listen to this...there's no contest, it may as well be two different bands. Manowar, your fans love you but this just didn't work the way you wanted it to.

0307341577|2.0|I am stunned by the number of people who rave about this book! Dismal is the word that comes to mind when I sum up my feelings about Dark Places. First off, giving credit where credit is due, the author writes well. That being said I hated the story about a woman trying to retrace the past to when she was seven years old and her mother and sisters were brutally murdered. Libby, the protagonist in the story is not really likable, she's unpleasant, depressing and steals from anyone she can. Libby testified in court that her brother committed the murders but now wonders if she really remembers what happened or if she was repeating what police and child psychologists told her at the time. This self doubt is brought about by decidedly unlikeable and mostly creepy fans her convicted brother has in a club known as \\"The Kill Club\\". Libby, in need of money accepts their offer of cash in exchange for her involvement in questioning and tracking down other possible suspects. My big issue with this book (other than it was just an awful story) was that none of the characters were in the least bit likable or appealing. Making for a rather unpleasant read. I gave it two stars because the author writes well but the story itself is just not my cup of tea.

1609611543|1.0|The author attributes just about all of the world's ills to wheat, from ADHD to schizophrenia, autism, pimples, arthritis, cancer, hair loss, osteoporosis - you name it, wheat is to blame.  While we could probably all stand to eat fewer wheat products, I don't think it is as simple as the first several hundred pages of the book make it seem.  It is only at the tale end of the book that he adds that just getting rid of wheat isn't the solution - you must get rid of all carbs and eat handfuls of nuts and blocks of cheese instead. He's obviously an advocate of Adkins, which does help people lose weight, but...it, too, has health risks.<br /><br />His writing style is good, but he makes many conclusions that make no sense.  In his mind, stop eating wheat and you'll be cured.<br /><br />I gave the book one star because it annoyed me so much that I had a big bowl of oatmeal squares right after I read it.  (I am thoroughly enjoying the sugar high right now.  My blood glucose level must be skyrocketing.)  I felt somewhat scammed when he says at the end that in order to really change your life and feel better, you need to get rid of all carbs, including fruit and legumes.  Hogwash.

B005IQZB14|5.0|I read this book while going through some really trying weeks in my life with my health. It is not just about a women's incredible journey it is about bearing the unbearable. About not giving up when every part of you tells you you should. It is thought provoking, and extremely well written. It makes you believe in the power of the human spirit and the strength in all off us to make it through a very difficult time both physically and mentally! Loved this book.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Purchasing the book with weight loss expectations, the book gave me that but so much more.  An indepth look at the world of wheat as a GMO was enlightening and a bit frightening!  I've given up wheat for good...and lost 20 lbs. doing it!

B006VREN86|5.0|I was looking around for another series to obsess over and stumbled across Boardwalk Empire.  I was hesitant, since I usually don't like a lot of blood and gore, but I was hooked after the first episode! I finished the entire first season in four nights! Now I am panting for Season 2...<br /><br />Yes, there is a lot of B&G (Blood & Gore) and a lot of T&A (!!), but then we are talking about Atlantic City in the Roaring 20's!  The story line actually switches off between Atlantic City, Chicago and New York during the years of Prohibition.  We meet Al Capone and Lucky Luciano when they are just starting their careers as Mobsters.  The characters are well fleshed out and meld together beautifully.  While I am not an expert on the time period, it appears to historically accurate.<br /><br />Well written, well acted and beautifully photographed.  Luscious costumes (oh, those dresses!) are the finishing touch! A definite keeper!

0345803485|5.0|Contrary to many of the reviews I've read I found book 1 mesmerizing and read it in a day. It is more romance than erotica but I didn't find that to take away from it, at all. There is course language that some will find offensive, as well as some scenes that are engaged in. I did not find characters that lacked depth, just openings for further explanation and exploration. There are two other books for a reason. I found the characters intriguing, both Anastasia and Christian, for who is without some closely held shield that they don't easily pull it down and let everyone privy to their closely guarded secrets, fears, and apprehensions. I would highly recommend this book.

B005QI4TP8|5.0|Discovered this CD while using my Shazam app my iPhone when I heard Seven Devils on one of my fave TV shows. I was mesmerized by the song with its haunting and mystical sounds and lyrics so I took a chance on the CD, after reading several other positive reviews. The CD does NOT disappoint! It's now my favorite CD and I am probably going to try more music from this artist. I really don't know how to categorize the sound,..it's mystical, without falling into that 'too' new age genre and I love the tribal influence to the music. There is not a bad track on the entire CD
B000XUBFE2|5.0|My 15 year old daughter read this book and passed it on to me to read so we could discuss it. I couldn't hardly put it down.  The thing I most appreciated about this book was the depth of the characters and the story they told.  I already knew the horrors of the holocaust.  That was nothing new.  The characters themselves were new and as I got to know them and lived their story through them, I found myself thinking of my own life and my own story and the people in my life and their stories.  I found myself thinking about how difficult, complex, and fearful their lives were yet the joy and even security they were able to find in their relationships with just a handful of people and a few simple pleasures.<br /><br />This may sound like an odd and vague review but I also hate giving away details.  A book gets 5 stars from me when I find myself completely drawn to a story in a way that makes me finish the book and put it down but find myself pondering the book long after it is finished in way that makes it seem to not really end.  Someone recently referred to fiction as a way to escape, but I find the truly good books aren't really an escape.  You can't leave yourself as you read them because you bring yourself to the book and the book can't really leave you when it has ended because you take it with you afterwards. This is that kind of book.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|i love this game is a great game. so addicting and fun. people should rate this on a scale of 1 to 10 I rate it as 14
B007WEYGPC|5.0|This is probaly up in my top 3 favorite books.  Awesome book.  Does have the a few words that most people don't use these days but you have to keep an open mind and remember that's how things were back then.  GREAT BOOK!!!
B005QUQ99K|4.0|I bought this for my nephew and he loved it, i actually have had a little fun with it myself.
B008MEM24S|5.0|it very challanging which is what I like about it,and I think its better than where's my water really you need to get this app.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I really do like it.  The only problem I have with it is that you have to have internet connection to use it.  So if I am at a church and I don't know the password to their internet connection it is quite pointless.
B00005JL78|5.0|Love this movie -  if you like Tom Cruise you'll love it. Also sort of a modern \\"1948\\" movie. Saw it in the movies and again on a DVD.
B001UU75WK|5.0|I was a free trial prime member thinking about cancelling till Amazon added my two favorite shows (not already free on instant streaming) to Instant video. Fringe and the West Wing are great television shows, thank you amazon!
B004UID2LC|5.0|I have been looking for something like<br />this and it works perfectly. I have downloaded three videos with no problem. it was fast and good quality.
B007N8RULO|4.0|It is fun and moves along quickly but I would prefer that it not move the card to where it thinks best, although I have fewer moves that way. The ads are REALLY annoying. Shut your sound off! I won't buy Ford the ad was so annoying.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I read the whole series and love all three books. Something new and different, couldn't wait to get back to it if I put it down.
B0080QTZNO|5.0|As a writer open to all counsel, I have two things to say about this book:<br /><br />First, it was the kind of helpful advice that a good friend, dressed in his t-shirt and jeans and in no hurry at all, would sit down beside you and share with you because he truly wanted to help.  Friendly and funny, not overdressed and coming down at you from an elevated lectern of rules and regulations. It's full of real, practical, useable tools that can make a better writer of anyone if they use them.  Thank you, Stephen King, for this book.  Ya done real good!<br /><br />However, I was saddened by the fact that someone with your masterful ability to create, enrich and convey words images resorted to using so many four-letter words. True, I'm an adult and no one forced me to read it; it just seems, well... sad somehow that you felt your amazing talent needed those words to get the point across.  It's like flinging little spots of mud on the Mona Lisa.  Yes, it gets your attention, but the art is so much more beautiful without that.  But, like I said, I chose to read it, and it's your book, so the words you choose are up to you.  I'm just saying...<br /><br />Wish I had found this book years ago.  And I do hope that by now, you're fully recovered physically, Mr. King.<br /><br />Stephen King is a brilliant wordsmith.  Anyone who wants to be a better writer can learn important lessons on the craft from this book.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I thought it would be full of or at least contain some difficult to solve puzzles.  They are easy.<br /><br />But I somehow ended up addicted anyway and actually rather like the stupid game.  :)
B007J4T2G8|5.0|was a bit slow until chapter6-8 read book 2 was ok not so much in ur face and more like mills n boon's however freed has taken longer to read no as much of a 3 star<br />however it was a very good read unable to put it down needed to know what was happening next.<br />ladies your partners wont know what has happened to you if you have the same effect as i did from the book.
B008N1V11U|5.0|This is arguably the best mobile game out there! I haven't played Spiderman yet so I can't compare. However this game has PS2 graphics and smooth gameplay. Plenty of replay value. The voice acting is pretty good for a mobile game. This is a must have for any gamer!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is so much fun fun fun! i love love love it! it is awesome awesome awesome! it is so much fun fun fun!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Easy &amp; fun.<br />Keeps me busy when bored. Highly recommend this  app. This is fun on my new Kindle Fire.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Easy to use, accurate and can have many different locations loaded. The forecast goes far enough out to allow us to plan for trips.
0231161166|3.0|This book contains a lot of good info, but it's easy to get bogged down in the long drawn out details and lose sight of the point the author is trying to get across. It's like a professor lecturing in class.<br /><br />This author makes several references to the fantastic designs that evolution happened to come up with. It's ironic that a highly intelligent PHD and author can study all her life on the indescribable intelligence built into the software and workings of a tiny microscopic cell, and believe it happened by chance of some chemicals bumping into each other.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|its a fun game and is a lot like the movie..its sometime freezes and wont start up but its still fun
B007SYWFRM|5.0|It's a great game. It's like Cityville on Facebook. It gives Terrence to the latest movie. And it is a great way to teach kids responsibility. Ex: Collecting and feeding your animals. Making families.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|I love how it makes colors pop! It has filters and frames to play with. The torn frame is my favorite.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love it, my sister loves it, my mom loves it, my dad loves it, my family loves it. it is really fun when you have time.
B00881VLCE|5.0|great app - love the ability to change the number of pieces and that you can resume a saved puzzle.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is one cool game. yeah its very easy at first but tthen it gets hard then harder then hardest. but still the same idea. haha. a good way to pass time. KEEP IT UP BIG DUCK GAMES! :D
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I stumbled across this book and have been captured by the twisting story line as if descending the main staircase. just when you think you understand where the story is going you spiral down another level and realize how deep the plot is buried.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|I've been elbow deep in technology from the time I was a kid up through my current job as an IT Manager.  No matter what I'm working on, whether a desktop, laptop or server, I always use Arctic Silver and have never regretted it.  It's a great product that always does the job at the end of the day.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love playing this game on my Kindle Fire! It is easier to play this version than even on my computer. Bonus that it is free!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|I like playing it on this bigger screen. Good graphics. Simple premise, but challenging and engaging. It has a good replayability factor.
B0086700CM|4.0|I actually thought this was just pretty stupid at first but then I realized I kept picking up my kindle to play it. It does have a repetitive feel for to it but I seem to more addicted than bored. For now.
B00004YTIQ|5.0|I hesitated to purchase this cover because I read a lot of mixed reviews about it. It IS true that all that is included in the box is a tarp and a rope, with no instructions. But it's actually fairly easy to figure out. The cover fits perfectly on a 120 x 72 inch inflatable pool. And it's fitted really for that size...which is what I wanted. It has worked well to keep out leaves, bugs, etc. while keeping the water a nice temperature. It also has been durable when it's rained on top of it, and makes it sag a bit. But that's to be expected. I would recommend the product.
B003INBNXO|1.0|I could not wait to watch the movie Ip Man but, it turn out that the version I got was dub voice over in English which was so  lame they sounded like a child's voice over, and the picture quality was BAD  This English made version took away the essence of the characters the story felt fake and I hated it so upsetting to not get the original version with subtitles!
B0015DWJX2|4.0|Well written and sometimes humorous account of the German occupation of  Guernsey  during WWII. Easy, yet interesting read. Technique, by writing the entire story in a series of letters, makes it easy to feel like you are reading a diary.
B0086700CM|5.0|my kids love it they cant stop playing it. its the ideal game for the next genaration. I cant stop playing it eithercand neither can my husbund
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This book was simply amazing. I could not stop reading it. Once I started to read I couldn't stop until I had finished the book.
0812550706|5.0|I know that all human thought is derivative, but regardless, it's interesting to approach this book from the perspective of someone who has played all the Halo games and books. The style of the book is different, but it's science fiction, so it fits wonderfully. I can't wait to see the movie and I hope it succeeds in conveying Ender's inner turmoil.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book for anyone who enjoys science fiction.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|could do without the ads but no biggie since the game is free. easy to earn coins and open more games.
0345803485|1.0|Cannot understand what the fuss is all about, the books are badly written, no story line- a bad R rated Mills and Boons novel. Ana blushes, flushes, chews her bottom lip, rolls her eyes, and her \\"inner goddess\\" makes comments while her billionaire ravishes her in various settings!!!!!
B008MEM24S|3.0|I probably shouldn't compare this to Where's My Water but.....It's just OK . Puzzles seem repetative and not as inventive. I'm hoping that's just a function of it's being new and that it will sharpen with subsequent levels
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Love it.  Microsoft onenote but free.  Sync up all your items from work, home and your phone.  See something you like, make a note.
B0079XPUOW|2.0|In the interest of full disclosure: Yes, I'm the type of geek who's attended Star Trek conventions many years ago. As such, I had high hopes for this novel for two reasons: I've read a number of books by this author and was impressed by the quality of his earlier works, and second, the subject matter is a nostalgic favorite of mine. Without giving away the plot, \\"Redshirts\\" started exceptionally well, and I truly enjoyed Scalzi's creation based roughly upon a \\"Star Trek\\" themed universe.<br /><br />By the time I got to the second coda, it was a completely different story line thinly connected using tangential characters.  I skipped it to get to the third coda to see if it would take us back to the universe he created for the first story, and after reading a page or two of that, sadly it also didn't hold my interest.  I didn't even bother finishing the book.<br /><br />If this book had set initial expectations it was one \\"Trekkish\\" based novella and two almost completely unrelated short stories, then I would have reviewed it significantly higher.  As it is, it feels like the two additional short stories were included just to artificially inflate the page count, and left me disappointed  with the finish.<br /><br />To conclude:  Scalzi?  Great author.  Previous fiction?  Outstanding, and why I set expectations so high for his books.  This book?  Proof that even the best can have a bad day.
B0000000LI|5.0|Of course Mom loved the cd music having seen the program on Tv. Now to order the DVD she originally asked for. Good timimg too, it's her birthday. Peace

1592402038|4.0|Eats, Shoots & Leaves does a great job of illustrating how bad punctuation can change the meaning of what we write and read.  Ms. Truss goes into great detail laying out the basic rules of punctuation and give examples of how punctuation is used incorrectly in everyday life. As part of my job as an Army Officer, I spend countless hours correcting memos and papers. I highlighted several sections of this book that I will share with my subordinates and peers, in an attempt to improve their writing skills. The only reason I did not give it five stars is that the author came off as pretentious. Once I got past past the tone, I found this an enjoyable book. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in improving their punctuation skills and refreshing what they learned (or didn't learn) in grammar school.
B008MEM24S|4.0|Got here from Where's my water on kindle fire.  Game works great.  Need more levels!<br />Need more words to submit.  Here they are.
0307352145|4.0|As an Army Officer, I work work in a culture that values loud, charismatic, and extroverted personality types. Although I am having a successful career, I have always been bothered that introversion is viewed by some of my leaders as a weakness. After hearing about this book on NPR, I gave it a read and was very impressed with Ms. Cain's book. This book is a very thoughtful and interesting book that shows how many of the stereotypical weaknesses of introverts are actually strengths. After reading this book, I am now more comfortable and secure with my personality type and I also more keen to recognize how to interact with subordinates who are also introverts. In the military, usually the leader with the most charisma is able to sway a decision in their favor; a decision that may not be the best decision. Even if you are an extrovert, I recommend reading this book. Hopefully if enough leaders read this book, we can change the culture of extroverts, who may be stiffing the critical thinking of their more thoughtful and introverted subordinates and peers.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|This is a simple game, as all the best are, but always stays fresh whilst driving you crazy, this game is great for passing those boring moments in life.... train journeys, night in with the other half etc.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|interesting world with good graghics and a few glitches. over all a fun distraction<br />try it soon for yourself and be prepared to love it
B008MEM24S|5.0|if you like &quot;where's my water&quot; then you will LOVE &quot;where's my Perry. Highly recommened great on kindle fire SPEND THE 99&cent; IT IS WORTH IT :)
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I was glued to my tv, watching this for hours at a time.  Intelligent, fascinating, and beautiful sets and costumes.  I would pay large amounts of money to have season three right now!! I think about the characters and what will happen next.  I'm hooked, and that doesn't happen often.
B006AZZPCM|3.0|I adored this app. did everything! except occasionally the full video wouldn't download. then one day... the download button disappeared... um what happened? I'm using a diff app to download bids until the button comes back
B00846REIS|5.0|I thought this book had some many similarities to the story line of 50 Shades. It isn't nearly as intense but who doesn't want to read about a man with power who is good looking fall in love with the normal office worker. I can't wait to for the next one to come out.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|The app works as it should and looks nice. it reminds me in a sense of the high tech calf because it stores calculations in the history.
0743277465|4.0|This book is an interesting fast paced read...if you read it as an autobiography.  If you pick it up thinking you are going to be handheld into uncovering the basic elements of learning to be a high performer, you will be frustrated.  However, if you follow along with the author's story, and introspect on it with relation to your life events, you can easily draw parallels and internalize many concepts he tries to articulate. I would highly recommend the book \\"Mastery\\" by George Leonard as a more practical guide to learning and high performance. Josh's book would be an excellent follow up to see how one has practically applied all the elements that George has laid out and achieved very high levels of excellence.  Josh could have very well named the book \\"Joy in the Pursuit of Excellence\\"...that is the very essence of his book in my opinion.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I found this app to be a great addition to my Android  phone. I can now read books on my phone that were only available for a kindle. Navigation is smooth and easy.
B001RCD2DW|5.0|Not much to say except that these phones are amazing! Always a treat. BUY THEM! Great natural sound will make you appreciate new kinds of music with nuanced performances. I'll use any excuse to put these on...
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I've read all three Fifty Shades books and love them all.  After finishing one I had to read the next!
034580404X|5.0|I started this trilogy one day after receiving it for my birthday and I had all three books finished within a week. I tried to stay away from it but it was a real page turner. I cried, I laughed. It's been a long time since I've picked up a book and get so involved. I loved it and hopefully a movie gets started real soon, as I'm going through withdrawal. Can't wait to see Christian and Ana on screen.
B00884GR0W|5.0|I love mincraft so when I tried it I just couldn't stop playing with it.It is so much fun! I play it for hours and don't even realize it.
B008MEM24S|5.0|that's 2 for 2 for Disney.  this game is so fun, almost like it should be called &quot;Where's My Water: Extended Edition&quot;.  I love games that are tailored for phones and tablets.  For 99 cents, this one is a no-brainer.
B0086700CM|5.0|loooove this game. I play it all the time. its great on the big screen of my kindle . I recommend this game to everyone.

B000MR9D5E|4.0|This series sets the benchmark in nature photography. Really stunning images from all over the world and every kind of natural environment. The David Attenborough commentary is insightful and the pacing is good. Truly both educational and entertaining, in fact inspiring.<br /><br />My only issue with it is the disproportionate amount of time spent on cataloging predatory kills. Yes, I'm well aware that predation is not only part of nature but is essential to it, both in enabling magnificent creatures like lions and orcas to form part of our natural world, but also in maintaining the balance between herbivores and the producers (green plants) on which they feed. Take away the predators and in a short time the earth would be stripped of vegetation and everything would die. However, understanding why predation exists and watching it for entertainment are two different things. Without being too indelicate, evacuation of waste matter is one of the essential functions of all life forms, but I would find a production which devoted a considerable amount of time to showing it in graphic detail somewhat repulsive. The problem with predatory kills is that there are two parties involved, the predators (who can be amazing in their power and grace) and the prey animals, who are not having such a good time. Suffering, even by animals in the natural order of things and as a necessary part of life, is not pleasant to watch, to me at any rate.<br /><br />If you feel the same, you might want to watch this for the wonders of nature, but (as I do) have your remote ready to fast forward when the killing crops up.
B003Y58CKS|5.0|Rigoletto is a truly great opera of Guiseppe Verdi, composed in the same period as La Traviata and Il Trovatore. It is most difficult to pull it off well. This performance done in Dresden is sheer perfection with a dream cast in a European production.  Diane Damrau as Gilda, Juan Diego Florez as Il Duca and Zeljko Lucic as Rigoletto are all first rate. There is female nudity and a decadent elegance of the characters in bizarre headdresses that may be a turn-off for some. Juan Diego Florez plays against type here as the Duke Of Mantua. His angelic voice and genial spirituality is put to work here as tools for rampant seduction rather than the romantic heroism for which is known in the roles of my favored Gaetano Donizetti operas where he excels as Nemorino and Tonio in  \\"L'Elisir d'Amore\\" and \\"La Fille Du Regiment,\\" respectively. Florez here is visually spellbinding and vocally untouchable.  The chemistry between Florez and Damrau draws them together incredibly. Diana Damrau is a lovely, visionary and vocally apt Gilda. But it is Zeljko Lucic who commands and compels as the court jester Rigoletto. Spooked by a curse, (La Maledizione, the original title of this opera,)  which frightens him, this Rigoletto's pain is visceral as he resorts to the dispicable act of ordering the murder of the Duke which results in his profound loss. I've long pondered why Verdi allows the violated Gilda to sacrifice her life for the disloyal Duke when Mozart condemns Don Giovanni to Hell. Though Gilda loves the Duke with a steadfast first love, she knows, too, that a future life in Verona with her father Rigoletto would result only in more confinement for her sans love and marriage, making her sacrifice an easier choice. Damrau and Lucic perform Gilda and Rigoletto in the Metropolitan Opera's new version set in Las Vegas which can be viewed in Live in HD in theaters on Saturday, February 16, 2013.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Mysteries that have twists and turns are fun when created in the hands of a talented author.  This author is manipulative toward the reader.  The premise, the perspectives, the ending are pathetic. Different strokes for different folks I guess.  I won't be reading this author again.
034580404X|5.0|Novel has a modern love twist with real sex. The stuff people like to avoid talking about but would love to try.
B0058VW36U|5.0|i think this game is the funnest game in tje universe! its cool and my friends play it all the time!
B0072NWKEC|4.0|This is the eighth Bernie Gunther novel and with it the author regains his footing. A couple of the recent entries set after WW2 in Argentina and Cuba were not as compelling. But in this outing we are treated to the original stubborn but effective detective. Perhaps because it takes place in 1941 at the height of Nazi conquest and inter-organization intrigue that this novel works. Indeed there was a Alan Furst-like quality to the plot as it deals with Reinhard Heydrich, Czech terrorists, a German traitor, a femme fatale, and a locked door murder mystery.<br /><br />Heydrich is written about in such diabolical form that it near lionizes his intellect. And a new character, Kahlo, plays Watson to Bernie's Holmes helped to liven up the pace and dialogue as they went about dissecting the crime scene and assemblage of SS, SD, and Nazi suspects. Kerr appropriately addresses the irony of a murder investigation at the time when Nazi Einsatzgruppen death squads are roaming behind the advancing Wehrmacht executing Jews, partisans, and cut-off Soviet forces. Bernie's mordant Berliner humour, contested morals and hardheadedness help him survive in a very dangerous time and make for an entertaining read.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this was honestly the best calculated I have found in he app store!!! I recommend this to anyone that needs a calculator for their device
B0064X7FVE|2.0|The app was good but now it crashes whenever the map motion is attempted. Get a different app that works better.

B001GZ6QEC|5.0|I just saw Dark Knight Rises and it completes the Trilogy.  It has been my personal favorite Trilogy of all time.  I love Batman and these movies were all absolutely perfect to me.
B008JH5CVS|3.0|Its actually a decent movie. Snow manages to be kinda witty and turns out to be a decent enough character. The two main bad guys are actually scary in the fun way where they are actually believable and some what witty. The  fact that the movie takes place in space makes it all that much cooler.<br /><br />but then comes the end which is utter crap. They fall out of an exploding space station in space suits that fall apart and turn into skydiver suits. Then it tries to be really clever by putting a spin on why Guy was in trouble in the first place but does it in a way that doesnt connect to the rest of the movie and seems incredibly rushed.<br /><br />Its a 3.5 but they don't allow that so the directors utter lack of knowledge about physics in space (i.e. theres no atmosphere in space and therefore no sound in vacuum) pushes it down to a 3. Overall its a good way to kill time and something to watch while playing minecraft.
B004GCPJDQ|1.0|Received battery. Placed battery on induction plate: let it charge (from flashing) to full (solid green light). Place in mouse: mouse does not turn on. Replace with normal battery in mouse: it works. Hence, battery is bad. Put battery back on charger pad: it flashed green again ... this time all night. Next day, the battery looks charged (solid green). Place in mouse: does not work. Repeat all week.<br /><br />Very very disappointed. Returning it back to Amazon to see if second one works. The \\"Magic Charger\\" battery is defective. Do they even test the product before shipping?<br /><br />Secondly: the battery pack is plastic painted to look like the metal that the Magic Mouse is constructed from. Fits the mouse really tightly; but not as nice.
B0067TGSOK|5.0|I don't mean to make this a political commentary, but I happen to be reading the book when the news came out recently about President Obama's comments on the campaign trail when he said, \\"If you've got a business -- you didn't build that.\\"  He proclaimed to the crowd, \\"Somebody else made that happen.\\"  I had to laugh since I just finished reading these amazing stories about entrepreneurs who had the guts and talents to create all kinds of different businesses.  For example, there's the story about the guy who lost his job in the middle of the recession, and went on to create a successful mattress business.  If he didn't create that business, who did?  Anyway, political commentary aside, I thought this book did a very nice job of:<br /><br />* Providing lots of varying examples and stories<br />* Giving the basics of understanding customer needs<br />* Getting to the essence of communicating what your business does for customers (benefits not features)<br />* Highlighting inspirational stories of entrepreneurs around the world who are indeed building businesses<br /><br />It is not a complex MBA level text.  It's a very simple and quick read.  It may be too simple for some, but the stories are worth the price of the book.  I highly recommended
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the whole family loves this game!  fun for all ages! love playing and unlocking new games! enjoy the different levels if difficulties!
B003XVYLDU|1.0|I don't know what I was thinking when I started this book.  I had heard it was strange, and it is definitely that, but I guess I expected more from all that I had heard.  It was almost as if it was strange just for the sake of being strange.  Billy Pilgrim was insipid and stupid.  I saw no point in his being \\"unstuck\\" in time and the addition of the Tralfamadorians.<br /><br />I have often heard this book compared to Catch-22 by Joseph Heller.  Know I will cringe whenever I hear that.  The only similarity between the two is that they are about WWII.  Catch-22 is a good book that uses hyperbole and silliness successfully.  Slaughterhouse-five is just inane.
030758836X|3.0|To be fair I say it is okay and this is due to the ending of the novel. Imagine eating one of the best $12.99 meals you have ever had for only the last bite to taste like the smell of a pile of horse crap. (And I was even defending the price of this novel to my non-reader husband! Little does he know he has the last laugh.) So, basically the ending of the novel really let me down. It is sad I will have to remember Gone Girl as \\"that book I read with the most spectacular ninety-nine cent, one-star ending.\\" I would have appreciated a little more creativity from the author. As good as the rest of the novel was, I know she had it in her to write something better, and this makes me somewhat hesitant to dip into her previous work.
B007X4ECLY|4.0|I loved the characters in this movie, especially the crazy inmate and of course Guy Pierce.  I do love me some Guy Pierce.  I laughed through most of this movie, because it had a lot of witty banter.  The action scenes were decent except for the beginning chase and the part where they were falling back to Earth.  Those two parts were ridiculous and the graphics looked more like they belonged in a video game.  Plus, the falling to Earth thing was very unrealistic.  However, I would definitely watch this movie again and I'll probably end up buying it when the price goes down.  I recommend it!
B001HVZO9S|5.0|No book report summary of the plot or opinions on the acting.  Just talking of the Blu Ray disc itself.  While the Blu Ray I purchased for $5 doesn't say Special Edition, it had both the theatrical release and the extended version.  As extras, there were interviews with many of the actors and some SD deleted scenes with time code attached but not one of them seemed as if they needed to be in the movie. If anything, they were alternate versions of many of the scenes already included.<br />I saw this purchase as a guilty pleasure, impulse buy when I went to the store.  Glad I bought it.<br /><br />The audio is DTSHD 5.1 and the transfer blew me away, especially early on, with some fantastic directionality from the discreet channels.  There are a couple of scenes where the audio is DEMO worthy.  Great props to the sound editors.<br /><br />The video transfer is free from artifacting, aliasing or any stair stepping which would have shown itself most in the stadium scenes filled with students and other personnel.  Colors popped as they should have with eye catching uniforms and field movements.  The yellow of Mr. Lee's suit and the blue of his opponents suit were almost cartoonish with such deeply saturated colors from the transfer.  As a drummer myself, I completely enjoyed the movie once again, tho this time on Blu Ray.<br />Well worth the purchase.<br />All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.<br />Thanks
B00000G3PA|5.0|I have seen this movie probably 50 times or so in my life because I love it so much.  There are SO many good actors in this and they all do an amazing job in their roles.  I love the dialogue and the story line.  Of course it's a bit unrealistic, but what do you expect from a movie or this sort?  I could easily watch this every day for the rest of my life.<br /><br />\\"I want to name [the meteor] after my wife.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|This is the worst book I've ever read.  The worst.  Ever.  And I've read a lot of books!  How stupid has our society become that so many of us actually enjoyed this book and call it literature?  This pathetic author is now rich, based on what?  Her ability to insert the words \\"Oh my...\\" into text every couple of paragraphs?!  The characters are one-dimensional.  The \\"hero\\" is a complete ass I would never go near in real life, and would kill before allowing my daughter to date; the heroine is ridiculously stupid (and supposedly well-educated -- it's really terrifying how many people consider that to be an intelligent person), and the supporting characters are merely personifications with one defining trait each.  The only reason I'm wasting any more time on this book is because I want people to STOP READING IT!  Please don't encourage this woman to consider herself an author and inflict any more of her writings on society!  There are so many actual authors out there struggling to have their wonderful works of literature published.  Don't tell publishers that we want more of this drivel and less real literature in the world!
B007JMW46U|5.0|love my books ,can't ask for more. if you love an old time story this is the book for you.
B007XNAQLA|5.0|this line-up of musicians is a big deal for any true fusion fan! ponty finally joining up with grammy-winning band rtf is a monumental occasion!  of course, jean-luc has enjoyed the status of fusion royalty since the '70s and is a grammy-winner in his own right, but this spectacular (and possibly one-time-only) line-up promised a unique, dynamic and spell-biding result.....and it delivered on that promise in full force!  i so wish this tour had passed close enough to my goofy small home town so i could have witnessed the splendor firsthand.  still, i enjoyed these CDs and DVD immensely!  of course, it would have been nice to see dimeola in this line-up.  but frank gambale did a great job on guitar.  he did not try to fill-in for or emulate dimeola.  he just went in and did what he wanted to do....enjoying performing with these great musicians and adding his own spices to the mix in the form of his own unique and talented guitar-playing.  lenny white does not drive the lightning fast, hard-driving drumming of his youth, but he is still the consumate and perfect drummer with a more matured style that compliments the band as well as he always did.  white is still the perfect drummer for the job.  and stanley clarke??  what can you say?  stanley is still the most amazing bassist on the planet, whether on bass guitar or doghouse bass, no one can stand up to stanley......and he proves he is still the king all throughout this collection of discs.  chick corea still shines through on all songs with long, incredible jams and a mastery of music that made him a legend.  chick is in wonderful form on this disc.  and of course, the addition of the incomparable jean-luc ponty is what made this group so special.  i have been a huge jean-luc fan since the '70s.  he's always the best!  and his contributions to these discs are mind-blowing (as you might expect)!  adding ponty to this tour was a stroke of genius that paid off big-time!  the band realized this and gave ponty plenty ofroom to \\"do his thing\\".....lots of jam time and even a few rearrangents of moments like \\"the shadow of lo\\" & \\"concierto de alranjuez\\" which allowed ponty an opportunity to show his classical side.<br />i'll admit i can agree with some reviewers in their opinion that more new music would have been nice.  even the choice of ponty's song \\"renaissance\\", originally from his '75 solo album \\"aurora\\" has already been resurrected by the ponty/clarke/dimeola acoustic trio both live and in the studio.  another ponty fusion classic (especially electric) would have been better for this collection......especially since i've heard ponty wrote a song specifically for this tour, which is curiously missing from this disc.  still, the 19-minute version of renaissance on this album is a spectacular highlight that you should not miss!!!  there are unique, wonderful, sparkling renditions of all the songs in this collection!  even though i would have adjusted the song selection somewhat, these are all great songs, performed as never before.....rocking when it needs to rock......long, sweet, jazzy solos......everyone in the band more than pulling their weight......even if you have a gripe about no new songs, when you hear the fabulous performances on this album, you'll just need to give it a 5-star rating!  you can't help it!  it's that good!  and it's sure to make its way into your list of all-time favorites!<br />yes!  it's THAT good!<br /><br />(footnote:  the interviews and alternate versions of after the cosmic rain & romantic warrior on the dvd are fun and worthwhile too.....although i'd still like to see a full concert dvd!)<br /><br />p.s.--chick....if you're out there......PLEASE invite jean-luc to join you on your next rtf tour!  he's a spectacular addition to your already top-notch flight team!  this really is a special album!
0312323867|5.0|This is the followup to what happens after the whole Darcy-Rachel-Dex drama of \\"Something Borrowed\\". If you haven't read \\"Something Borrowed\\" yet, I suggest reading it before you begin indulging in this Emily Giffin novel. This one will make much more sense after reading \\"Something Borrowed\\".<br /><br />When I started the book, I hated Darcy, and could barely get past page one. I put the book away and didn't pick it up until recently. Don't worry- this book is better than \\"Something Borrowed\\". Get through the first few chapters and you too won't be able to put it down.<br /><br />To say I loved, adored, or cherished this book would be an understatement. This is possibly one of the best novel's I have read. While it gets placed on many chick-lit book lists, I didn't find that it was so \\"fluffy\\" I thought it was dumb or annoying. I read this book in three days and could barely put it down while I was in class or at work.<br /><br />I'm not normally a sap- especially when it comes to books- but this Emily Giffin novel had me laughing out loud and crying left and right. This is one of those books you'll never sorry that you read. It is amazing. I suggest reading it. If nothing else, it will teach you a good life value or two.<br /><br />Emily Giffin is a new favorite author of mine. No questions asked.
0765316994|5.0|Read this book because:<br /><br />1) It is the most I have ever laughed aloud while reading a book. Seriously, no matter where I was, I could not stop myself from giggling. And it's not just the plot. It's the...<br /><br />2) ...dialogue. We're talking the characters banter back and forth and say the funniest things. And there is no reason to be a sci-fi nerd to appreciate this banter. It's just plain funny adult humor. It reminds me of talking with my co-workers back when I was still at the engineering job. *love*<br /><br />3) You love Star Trek. You think the whole Red Shirt thing is hilarious.<br /><br />4) You are looking for a book with surprising depth. Seriously, the main bulk of the book was just funny. And then it got all serious and really surprised the heck out of me and made me think about life, the universe, and everything.<br /><br />5) You're kind of tired of books taking themselves so seriously. You want to just step back and enjoy a book. You don't want to think about the writing. You want to get lost in a great book.<br /><br />As a total first for me, I loved this book so much, I am next going to listen to the audiobook version (which has Wil Wheaton narrating). This book goes on my best reads of the year for sure. I only wish I could dive into the world and become a part of it. What fun! Highly recommended!<br /><br />(are you convinced yet?)<br /><br />Source of book: From publisher by request
0345803485|4.0|I consider it quite hard for myself to write a review of Fifty Shades of Grey. Why? Because as much as I wanted to hate this book, I loved it. I loved every minute of it and am sad that the series has come to an end (I finished all 3 in about a total of a week and a half).<br /><br />I saw people posting on Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, etc. about Fifty Shades. I wasn't sure what it was about, but I knew there was a lot of \\"hype\\" and criticism surrounding the book. So like I did with Hunger Games, and Twilight I decided I wouldn't read it. Not my type of book. I am used to reading light hearted and fun chick lit novels. I figured Fifty Shades didn't quite fit into that genre. Not to mention the \\"relationship\\" the book involved. It just wasn't my thing- no way. No way would I ever read it.<br /><br />Then it seemed as though everyone around me began reading this book and falling in love with Christian Grey. As much as I like to differ from the crowd and do things my way, I can hardly ignore a book being talked about so much by people who don't even typically read books. After much consideration, and persuading from friends who couldn't put it down, I borrowed the book and proceeded to read the entire thing in about three days.<br /><br />The writing itself was not incredibly amazing. It's typical fan fiction writing, right up there with Twilight. However, E.L James's character development was beyond superb. By the end of the first book I felt like I'd know Ana for years and she confided in me her secrets about Grey. As much as I wanted to dislike Christian Grey, I couldn't help but love him. Even though I'm embarrassed to admit it, I shed a tear or two for the characters in this book. But, then again, that's what you would do if these were your real friends, right? And that is what James makes you feel.<br /><br />Meet Ana Steele, an innocent college student who works part-time at a local hardware store and lives with Katherine Cavanaugh. It all starts when Ana's roommate is sick and can't make the interview she has lined up with Christian Grey. Ana gets stuck into attending the interview and that's where it starts.<br /><br />Clumsy and flustered she stumbles into Grey's office mesmerized by his beauty and nervous. So much so that she asks Grey some embarrassing questions. From there it is a wild chase that will keep you flipping the pages.<br /><br />Ana's life is forever changed when she learns Grey's secret and she must battle with her feelings for him as well as the future she had always imagined for herself.<br /><br />If you have reservations about reading this book because of the type of relationship Christian and Ana are involved in-- read it! I almost let this book pass me by entirely because of their physical relationship. I told you, I never read books like this one. After book one, things cool off a bit and the story actually becomes more enjoyable. When you get to the parts of book one where you consider putting it down because it's just too much to handle, keep going! I promise, you're going to love it. If you can look past the physical part of their relationship this story is about two people falling in love, one with a troubled past.<br /><br />Again, I'm writing this review after finishing all three in the series. I will tell you that book one was my least favorite, with the third being my absolute favorite. But, the second one was wonderful too. They all are!

B004SIIBGU|3.0|App worked great at first then it would never open and the kindle would automatically close it out with a error message.
B00005LC4Z|5.0|A classic movie.  Amazing acting and directing.  I've seen this movie at least 20 times and will watch it many more times.  Everyone needs to see this movie at least once.  It's fun, emotional and witty.  Robert Zemeckis and the writters did an outstanding job at weaving Forrest Gump's story with American History.  And there are more memorable quotes from this movie than I can count.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Downloaded this to read documents easier on my kindle fire and I was not disappointed. I am a college student and instead of wasting printing credits I just open the document in the app and read it from there. So much easier to open the kindle fire instead of brining 20 pages to class.
B0088RQ4X4|4.0|One of the best new scif films out in a long while.  A Confederate Civil War soldier, finds himself transported to Mars, a desert planet. He ends up in the middle of another war, defeats the bad guys (at least for a while), and finds love in a princess.  The special effects are great as was the plot and dialogue.  You can;t go worn with this film.

B0082FPIY8|3.0|First things first: Wild is not a memoir of hiking the PCT; it's a memoir of (hopefully) the most troubled period of the author's life, which happens to include a long-distance backpacking trip on the PCT. Therefore, if you're looking for a memoir that focuses on nature, hiking, or backpacking, this probably isn't for you. (However, if you're looking for examples of how NOT to prepare for a long-distance backpacking trip, Wild certainly provides plenty of that!)<br /><br />In her early/mid-twenties, the author experiences a personal tragedy (the death of her mother) that sends her on a downward spiral of self-destruction. The lack of family support and a less-than-ideal childhood only exacerbate the problem by not providing her with the stability and tools to cope, especially during what is traditionally an unstable, transitional period of life anyway. However, it's obvious that a lot of her problems are her own doing. She pushes away an unconditionally loving and supportive husband who was probably the most stable person she'd ever had in her life. She has a relationship with a heroin addict who gets her hooked, too, but she is reluctant to break it off. Unprotected sex with the addict leads to a pregnancy that ends in abortion. Unfortunately, she doesn't disclose any emotions or thoughts regarding the actual abortion itself, and we don't find out how she got off heroin - both struggles that would have added to the book. She is woefully unprepared for a long-distance backpacking trip, which creates misery for her: unnecessary gear leads to a heavy pack that causes abrasions and scars; she's unconditioned and, thus, struggles to achieve her estimated daily mileage; her boots are too small, causing her constant pain. The author organizes what becomes, quite frankly, the brutal murder of her mother's beloved horse because she couldn't be bothered to scrounge up the money for humane euthanasia. The horse unnecessarily meets an excruciating, violent death; the action was thoughtless, cruel, and disgraceful. (Hell, if she had called around to some vets to let them know what the alternative was, someone would've done it for free or at cost.) This incident causes the author a lot of anguish (though it pales next to what the horse went through), but it was she who caused it. I'm not sure that the author ever gains the self-awareness to realize that she is the cause of so much of her own pain, a lesson that would have greatly strengthened the book.<br /><br />Some reviewers dismiss the book based upon judgements of the author's character: a whiny, irresponsible young woman who engages in casual sex and drug use. Yes, that's an accurate description. But hey, she was in her early/mid-twenties at the time, and everyone made bad choices when they were young. Plus, responsibility and morals are things that have to be instilled in a young person; if they're not, they are slow to acquire on one's own. She obviously had no one around to teach her such things and, therefore, had to learn them on her own. The biggest fault in this book is that we never know what the author learned or even if she learned anything at all. The ending is unsatisfying and abrupt; her journey ends, but how is she changed? We never really find out. Years later with her husband and children, the author revisits the spot where she ended her journey. Apparently, she managed to find happiness and stability, but we're not told how she went from that still messed-up young woman who hiked the PCT in the mid-90s to a woman who seems to have gotten her life together. It's a shame.<br /><br />I appreciate that the author ultimately triumphed by completing her journey and overcoming her fears of the trail. I was engaged by the accounts of her experiences on (and off) the trail, though they are superficial. While I felt that Wild was an enjoyable read, I don't find it to be the inspiring tale that it aspires to be. Quite simply, the author never shows the reader that she has learned and grown either by experiencing hardships on the trail or by reflecting on her past experiences and actions. The reflection, understanding, and acquisition of self-awareness that would lead one \\"from lost to found\\" is unfortunately absent from the book.

B006R8GK2Q|4.0|Good graphics, well written story,i enjoy the soundtrack very much.I expect to buy more g5 games.Also i am using a chinese tablet with android 2.2 that means froyo still is alive,ha ha.Sometimes the character that talks to main character appear as a rectangular white sheet,but that could be the android 2.2 effect!.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|As a fan of the first two \\"Alien\\" movies, I held off buying this anthology on Blu-Ray because I had bought the various re-releases of these films through the years as home video technology improved and picture quality got better and better. I collected these films on VHS, then Laserdisc, then DVD, from crappy pan & scan versions up to the the latest DVD realeases, which were pretty good. Anyway, I was kind of burnt out on the whole franchise when they announced this Blu-ray release.<br /><br />Amazon had offered this set at under $30 at least once before, but I still held off. They recently offered it again for $28.95, which was less than it was going for used, and almost the same price as the first two movies purchased individually (note that the individual sale discs have few extra features), so I took the plunge - I'm really glad I did!<br /><br />All four films are offered in two different versions, and there are more extras here than only the most die-hard fans will ever care to fully look at (each film has its own 2+ hour \\"making of\\" documentary, plus thousands of productions stills, amongst other goodies).<br /><br />\\"Alien\\" looks and sounds amazing - If people ask what makes Blu-Ray so much better than standard DVD, this would be the comparison to show them. I always loved the sets for this film, and in hi-def you see every gritty detail that made this movie so convincing. To me, this single film was worth the price alone.<br /><br />\\"Aliens\\" is almost as good - they used a lot of blue screen in this film, and my earlier copies always made those shots stick out. They blend in much better on Blu-ray, a testimonial to the people who remastered this film. It's probably the best this film will ever look on a home screen.<br /><br />After seeing these two films it's hard for many to get into the films that followed. \\"Alien3\\" just didn't click for me, and \\"Alien Resurrection\\" was at turns just too bizarre and goofy.<br /><br />If you are a fan of all four films, then this will be worth the going price - you will not be disappointed. If you just like the first two films only, this box set is still worth getting if you want the extras and see it on sale.hen this will be worth the going price - you will not be disappointed. If you just like the first two films only, this box set is still worth getting if you want the extras and see it on sale.

B005LAIIRQ|3.0|Having stated the above title of my review I went headstrong into this movie on a late Friday night.  I almost turned it off twenty minutes in.  These type of movies where something like this could happen and may have happen to some unfortunate souls somewhere had always intriqued me, but now I find them so gruesome and depressing that I will probably not see this movie again.<br /><br />As one reviewer has written it's more of a psychological thriller than a survival story because..well,...you will just have to see the movie.  Liam's face on the cover should give you a clue.<br /><br />The gift for me is probably the complaint of others.  That is, the Greys seem mechanical and fake, which is what I kept telling myself during cringe worthy moments.  The storyline is more about the human condition and our relationship with the darkness that is life as well as the ability to make choices that persist against obstacles and all odds or total surrender to the destiny that knocks.  Only the strong survives comes to mind, but strength can be measured in many ways.<br /><br />For me at this point in time in my own survival journey where the conditions aren't so bleak, however, various types of wolves in everyday living is always preying in someway on ones vulnerabilities or waiting for a weak moment in an individual or perhaps even the one trying to keep up with the rest.<br /><br />Anyway, watching a movie in this genre always requires self-examination and that's a good thing.
1451627289|4.0|4.5 stars<br /><br />This was the first Stephen King novel that I have ever read...mostly because the horror genre is not one I enjoy at all. Time travel, however, is something that fascinates me, and the Kennedy assassination is always an interesting topic. It took no time at all for me to appreciate King's ability to draw the reader into his story. I lost track of the number of nights I read way, way too late because I just couldn't stop.<br /><br />The plot line is thoroughly covered in other reviews. I will just add that I found it a gripping story and would recommend it to my fellow time-travel lovers and anyone else out there who has avoided King's horror stories. The one aspect of the book I didn't like was the language, thus 4.5 instead of 5 stars. I know that it doesn't bother some people, but I can do without it.
0375836675|4.0|I had high expectations for this book considering that I had already read his other book The Book Thief, one of of the most beautiful, emotional reading experiences I've ever had. I Am the Messenger fell short of those, perhaps impossibly high, standards. Nonetheless, it was an enjoyable and light read with well-drawn, likable characters and wickedly funny writing. Ed is a 19 year old, deadbeat cabdriver. He doesn't have, nor cares about, too much. It all changes one day when he helps stops a bank robbery. After that, he starts receiving mysterious playing cards with names of people who need help. So, he goes around helping people and in the process finds meaning in his own life It sounds corny, and in some ways it is, but somehow it just works in this book. My two big issues with this book were the ending and the pacing. The ending I felt was rushed and didn't fully resolve the story, while the story also moved slow at times. Don't let these stop you from reading though, it really is a fun book to read, as long as you are not expecting another Book Thief.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|ok this is a pretty good game but its just too easy. i did the first few level to get the hang of it but then i went strait to the last one and i beat it first try.
B00008BXJG|5.0|This is the album that broke them in the US.Far superior to any dc lp that came after.Every trendy fan in the world says Back in Black.Yes BIB is a great album,maybe because him bled into it.Highway just Rocks!The opener is probably the most famous and recognizable hard rock song of all time.No filler on this album.Not one weak track from HTH to Night Prosper.I do not understand why If You Want Blood is not played live to this day,although maybe Brian can't. do it justice.I could just imagine this live.I have been to every tour since 88 Blow Up Your Video.This should be the 20 Million seller not BIB.This is there second best selling album .It simply swings all the way.Even a song like Get it Hot,which because of how short it is you would think it might be weaker but I love this track,makes me want to party.Then again,does not all AC/DC.There last true 5 STAR 10OUT OF 10 album!
B0086700CM|5.0|awesome game!  very addictive!!  This game is very simple to understand but very challenging!  No problems with the operation.  Go get it!!
B007P6VLRS|5.0|This thing is good, pretty good.<br />We have to accept the fact that Mellon Collie SP is not coming back, as Ten PJ is not coming back. But, this new SP album is pretty good, I'd give it 4.5.<br />For me Zeitgeist seemed like the end of SP, after a couple of so so albums and with a downward tendency.<br />However this album is great, starts a bit looking for it's personality, kind of messy, but starting with track 3, this just makes sense.<br />Not the original SP, of course, but with the essentials with a modern twist, move on, this is not 1995 anymore, please enjoy SP best since, IMO.<br />Hope this helps.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I was tempted to put this book down after the first chapter.  I carried on thinking it would surely get better as it was a best seller.  I should have chewed my lip, blushed and thrown the book away.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I really enjoy this game. It eases you into the game and then suddenly drops you into the real challenging levels. Super addicting brain teaser!
0375869026|4.0|I really liked the book Wonder. It was very sad and made you think that words do hurt others. Before I read this book I didn't really think that I was hurting their feelings. I really liked how the author included almost everyone in the book so they could share their thoughts and feelings. One thought that a classmate said was, \\"It's not enough to be friendly. You have to be a friend.\\" I like that quote because August (the main character) was different and didn't have many friends and she understood that you have to be a friend to everyone. I personally liked everything about the book, but the author could have gone more in depth in the situations. Like telling more about how he/she felt about what happened. I could have read about the events in the book for days, but they were very short and were not in great detail. August was a \\"different\\" child. His face had some defects, but inside he was beautiful and had a great spirit. One quote that his friend summer said goes perfectly with August being beautiful in the inside. \\"You are beautiful no matter what they say words can't bring you down you are beautiful in every single way yes, words can't bring you down.\\"  August also is very sweet and makes the best of everything. I really liked him. One thing the book surprised me was how fast I read it. It was so good and I couldn't put it down! It also surprised me how mean the people were treating August. Its so sad to think that someone could treat a boy like that when they don't even know him. Another quote that Miranda said, \\"I forgot that I might see so many beautiful things I forgot that I might need to find out what life could bring,\\" really explains the book, because most people would make fun of a child that looks \\"different\\" to them, but you could just open your eyes and see that they could be really nice, funny, ect.. One question I have about the book is why Augusts mom wanted him to go to school in the beginning, but then later on in the book she didn't. The author could have told us more about Jack Wills family and home life. I would really like to know about that. Maybe they will have a second book!! But overall I really liked this book. I will recommend this book to everyone of all ages because it is so good. I would give this book a 4 out of 5 stars. If you want a book that you cant put down, that will bring you to tears, and is great read this great book!!
B0027MJU00|5.0|This book is fantastic, edge of your seat, up late reading every night kind of fantastic. It has raw., real characters. I love how she tied together every piece of the story, every family characteristic,every big moment. The journey is far more important than the ending. But the ending itself is like the biggest release of pressure you've ever felt. I don't like it when people go into too much detail, but I will say that the book is graphic,disturbing subject matter. It is a beautiful novel,but its not for everyone. Can't say I didn't warn you.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a very good application it runs very smoothly on my kindle fire. I really enjoy doing the Bible reading plans!
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|I gave up reading Stephen King 20 years ago. I found his stories very disturbing. I got into western books and found immediate relief. While recently looking for a new book to read I found the reviews of 11/22/63 seemed very good for the most part.<br />After downloading it onto my Kindle (a little pricey for a Kindle Book) I got hooked. A fascinating, edge of your seat story. Also his excellent skills as an author were prevelant through the whole book. I'll start looking a little closer at his books. But!! the genre of \\"Pet Cemetary\\" and the like are still out of the picture. Highly recommended by a Senior Citizen.
B007SGM084|1.0|Had I known the premise for this book I would not have purchased it for my kindle.  The story line was interesting but having to wade thru pages of overdone sexual situations ruined it for me.  The main characters were pathetic, sexual deviates, and not worthy of my money.  I spent most of my time paging forward to find something worth reading.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Thia hs to be the worst book i have ever read. It seems like every page is sex. i  mean seriously $@&?!  why waste time this way. I hte this book. if you want a good book get the mortal instruments i can assure you its not  piece of $&@?! i tried to give it no stars but sadly i cant do that
B00846WWVM|3.0|This game has fun graphics and is exciting (for the 6 year old).  It gets progressively harder, so keeps the challenge up.  My biggest gripe is that the controls are not intuitive or very responsive.  I have trouble adjusting the aim of the water cannon, and the aforementioned 6 year old starts to get very frustrated.  I got this game to entertain the 6 year old, not to frustrate her and then me by proxy.  Bottom line: cute game, but could use some control improvements.
B008JFUUFI|5.0|I would rate this as one of the 10 best films I've seen.  It isn't the typical movie which can be enjoyed without thought.  When I saw the movie, spontaneous discussions broke out in the theater at the end of the movie, also in restrooms and the lobby.  Complete strangers anxious to get others \\"take\\" on what we just saw.  If you like to have something to think about at the end of a movie Take This Waltz is a must see.  Like all great art different people will see different things in this movie.  It is a good comedy on one level, where it goes from there is up to the viewer.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Really love this game!  I downloaded it for my son since he really enjoyed &quot;Where's My Water&quot;, and he can't get enough!

B004LWZWGA|5.0|First, I'd like to express my sorrow for the tragedy in Aurora. This is a shame and another disgraceful, cowardly act. Thoughts and prayers to the families of the victims.<br /><br />Now, the movie. Stunning. I had to see this movie twice in order to make a proper review. Like Inception, this was so complex I had to see it again to fully appreciate what I'd just seen. It is simply brilliant. A perfect, satisfying conclusion to one of the very few great trilogies ever. And simply the greatest superhero/comic book trilogy. In fact, I don't know if that feat will be accomplished again.<br /><br />This movie collects its parts and puts them together well. Christian Bale was great as Bruce Wayne and Batman. This series showed us the hardship of being a human who decides through grief to take on really an impossible mission against all odds. And somehow, he actually succeeds to a certain extent. This wasn't so much a story of a superhero but of a man and his extraordinary journey to find closure to a trauma in his life and at the same time sacrifice himself for others in duress or without hope, showing what a true hero is. Compelling.<br /><br />There's so much going on that easily this film could've been lost. Few have the talent to hold it together and Christopher Nolan did it like a master. What a storyteller. He is the leader of the new breed of master storytellers with the likes of Joss Whedon, JJ Abrams and Matthew Vaughn. These guys control their worlds with great crews and casts.<br /><br />Everyone brought their A game. Gary Oldman, JGL, Morgan Freeman, Anne Hathaway, Marion Cotillard, Tom Hardy. Great character portrayals.<br /><br />Catwoman was cool and very relevant. No camp here. Good job.<br /><br />Bane. This villain was great. Now, people keep comparing him to Joker. Not similar whatsoever.  And that's what makes these villains great. They're not the same. Ra's Al Ghul, Scarecrow, Joker, Two Face, Bane. All their own person. I love that. Let me say, out of them all, Joker does stand out the most. Not because he's a better villain but because of the type of villain he is. He was so unpredictable in his actions. However, for the type of villain Bane is, he was even more dangerous. I love those differences. That way I don't feel like I'm watching a repeat. Bane was cool, cold, calculated, powerful, confident evil. He and Batman's brawls were intense. I loved his voice. It had class at the same time with ferocity. And, unlike some who must blast loud music in their ears causing hearing loss, I understood everything Bane said, and it wasn't that hard. You definitely couldn't be a passive listener though. You have to focus.<br /><br />I loved the twists in the story and, not to give anything away, the comic nod and conclusion left me completely satisfied. I love this trilogy. No superhero film has captured the humanity of its characters the way Batman Begins, The Dark Knight and now, The Dark Knight Rises did. The closest ones that did are Iron Man, X-Men First Class and Watchmen. As far as realism is concerned I mean. There are other comic films, like The Avengers, I love. In fact, The Avengers and The Dark Knight Rises are my favorite movies this year. And both so different.<br /><br />This movie has its critics, but like each film in this series, it garners far more praise than negatives. So negative reviews will be nothing but a whisper in the wind.<br /><br />I tie this with The Dark Knight. This trilogy is spectacular. Go see it.
B004LWZWBU|5.0|The Big Year takes a fairly mundane topic, birding (note to any birders, I'm not trying to insult your sport, just acknowledging it's not considering exciting by many) and makes it into a fantastically immersive movie. The movie really isn't about the birding, though there's plenty of beautiful birds throughout, it's about the relationship of three unconnected characters both to their loved ones and to each other, and how one small decision--to participate in a \\"Big Year\\"--changes the way they look at themselves and how they interact with their loved ones. Jack Black, Owen Wilson and Steve Martin all give compelling performances, and minor characters including Community's Joel McHale never fail to bring a smile.<br /><br />The cinematography of this movie is also fantastic; given the premise there are plenty of options to pan across stunning vistas, but the film doesn't just hold itself to that. There are plenty of unusual and, dare I say it, avant garde camera techniques. Overall this was a surprisingly good film about a subject I wasn't overly familiar with or interested in; one of the better films I've seen in a while.
0575024119|5.0|Read the author when I was a young girl and still found it interesting now and realized how ahead of the times the heroines of these novels were.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I'd rather pay for an app so I don't have to look at all the ads.  There's always an ad on the screen.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book is not worth the time and money... unless you want to basically read a porno.  It is basically a S&M book.  I was hoping it would have more intelligence and substance as I read on but it didn't get any better just more of the same old same old.  The girl is a predictable.. for lack of a better word, idiot and doesn't give you a lot to like.<br /><br />Basically it's a badly made, poorly written version of twilight with BDSM...sorta.  I see similar things from Twilight but really it could stand alone on its own.  I believe the author just wanted to throw in the \\"Twilight Name\\" to gain some more attention and make her poorly written book more popular.  Sad to say that it actually worked because people buy into that kind of thing.<br /><br />The constant erotic scenes get annoying after awhile.  Stop writing love scenes and work on making your characters more appealing and holding someones interest.  Sorry, constant pornography (that, by the way is not even written well) is not entertaining to me.  I like romantic novels but I also like them to have a bit of intelligence behind the writing and something more then just erotica.  I got bored after awhile and just didn't finish it.  I do not understand how this is a \\"best seller\\".  It's one of the worse.. it probably is the worst thing I ever read.<br /><br />I really wouldn't waste time or money on this book and especially the 2 sequels after.  As if it wasn't bad enough.. there's two more books.
0345472322|2.0|I bought this book thinking it would help me develop more of a growth mindset, but it hasn't, and I don't expect it will (because of my own fixed mindset?  maybe).  The book seems short on details on how to do this, spending most of its content, as others have pointed out, on anecdotes and a lot of other examples of how the fixed mindset falls short and the growth mindset is more effective.  There is some value in that, but it's too much of the book, and in some cases it was actually off putting to me, as I think that Dweck gets unnecessarily judgmental about some of the people she says have fixed mindsets, like Lee Iacocca and John McEnroe.<br /><br />This seems ironic to me, since it seems to me that there's a bit of chicken and egg in the growth mindset, i.e., if you have a fixed mindset about mindsets, it may be unlikely that you'll develop a growth mindset, given the limiting nature of the fixed mindset and the fact that you don't just choose to have a growth mindset, you learn to have one (at least, that's my understanding).  Therefore, it hardly seems fair to blame anyone for having a fixed mindset, but it also means that addressing this quandary is necessary in a book such as this one, since the person with a fixed mindset first has to overcome the fundamental barrier of not believing the very notion of mindset and its changeability.  Now, I don't think that we're all absolutely fixed or growth-oriented in our mindsets, so most people with fixed mindsets may be able to approach the development of a growth mindset at least as a working hypothesis, but I still think Dweck needed to address this crucial point, but didn't.  The examples and anecdotes help to convince one of the value of the growth mindset, but I think I need more practical guidance on how to get started (some exercises or something else along those lines).<br /><br />Lastly, I have to wonder if this book sells so well partly because Dweck is a Stanford professor.  I have to admit that I was influenced by that, but think we need to be more careful about assuming that because someone has impressive credentials, their product must be good.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I LOVED this series!  My taste in books varies greatly dependent upon my mood, however this was the first time I had read any sic- fi & I'm hooked!  I have read book 6 & excitedly waiting for a 7th!
B005OZE9SA|5.0|I am starting out learning to play guitar. I wanted a way to record myself playing guitar onto my laptop so I could go back and listen and to also play both lead and rhythm parts and mix them together.<br />After asking a few questions on a message board, the Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 was recommended to me. It's pricier than some of the options I was considering but given the reviews I figured it was worth taking a chance.<br />I'm glad I did. The Scarlett 2i2 is a piece of cake to set up, even for a guy like me that's pretty PC savvy but never dealt with external recording devices.<br />I'm running Windows 7 64-bit and everything installed flawlessly. The drivers loaded without a hitch and immediately recognized the Scarlett when I plugged it in.<br />The included Ableton Live 8 Lite software recognized the unit as well.<br />I'm looking forward to using the Scarlett more to improve my guitar playing. So far, I'm very happy with my purchase, even if it was a little more than I initially wanted to spend.

B007N85ZXY|5.0|This cd is like a time machine because the band is showing no signs of age.  The material of traditional \\"Americana\\", besides of course the God Save the Queen selection (which I believe is more sarcasm until the final verses of let freedom ring) sounds fresh.  The band is firing on all cylanders and the background vocals rise up to complete the sound (especially on Gallows Pole).  Overall this is some of the best of Crazy Horse and a great way to celebrate traditional American Music by giving it a rock n roll spin that works.

B005LAIIRQ|1.0|This is one of the best acted BAD movies I have ever seen. The problem is with its stupid script and inept direction.<br /><br />For those who know anything at all about airplanes or wolves or survival skills, YOU are way ahead of the ignorant twit who came up with this film's script.<br /><br />Time and again there are huge plot holes regarding these three facets of the story of a small group of men attempting to survive in the arctic after their plane has crashed and they are being attacked by a pack of wolves.<br /><br />Virtually no attempt is made to keep bare hands covered and warm ... and oddly none of the men seems to suffer from the cold to any major extent. Probably the stupidest scene is where two people went into a stream, and when Liam Neeson's character got out in soaking clothes, he wasn't cold at all - he just wore his wet clothes till they dried out from his body heat ... or whatever, never even shivering as he strolled along.<br /><br />There are only two short \\"good\\" scenes in the whole film. In one of them, Neeson's character helps a dying man get through his ordeal. In another, a depleted man sits down and makes it clear that he will go no farther, because back in civilization his life is just crap. A few scenes try to be \\"philosophical\\" about religion and God and faith, but they fall flat, chiefly because they are too one-sided towards atheism.<br /><br />The ending leaves one rooting for the wolves, who seem to have the mindset of the worse apes in PLANET OF THE APES. Why? Because the men are basically a disease in their territory, and perhaps in every territory, and are best eradicated.
B000UD0ESA|5.0|This movie was awesome. The style is very different from many other futuristic movies. It is more of a drab, gritty world rather than a sparkling, shiny one. The plot is also amazing.

B00006EXCC|5.0|I am a big fan of the early pre-1967 stones. they still had a lot of blues based number in those days, balanced, with great pop numbers like mother's little helper~the stones cautionary tale of pill-popping housewives and lady jane. highly recommended addition to your Rolling Stones collection. Also, this is one of the last album where Brian Jones was really involved in the creative process.
0321811984|5.0|This is my first time reading a book from Garr Reynolds. It is a great book. There are secrets of having good presentation. He introduces the basic principles of presentation process i.e. restraint, simplicity and naturalness. I like the ideas of trying not to use the bullets that I normally uses and eliminate non-essential element. In addition, using paper and pen (using an analog world not digital world) to sketch out rough idea prior to create our presentation is a good suggestion as well. There are total of 5 chapters in this book including<br />1. Introduction: Presenting in today's world<br />2. Preparation: Creativity, Limitations, and Constraints; Planning Analog; Crafting the Story<br />3. Design: Simplicity: Why it Matters; Presentation Design: Principles and Techniques; Sample Visuals: Images & Text<br />4. Delivery: The Art of Being Completely Presents; Connecting with an Audience; The Need for Engagement<br />5. The next step: The Journey Begins<br /><br />If you would like to get to know how to enhance your presentation, this would be a good choice. I have enjoyed reading this book.

B007PVHMCG|5.0|Who knew that two things could come together so perfectly!<br /><br />My 13 year old son has loved building with LEGOs since, well, forever. He became infatuated with Minecraft over a year ago. When he heard that Minecraft and LEGO worked to create a Minecraft specific set, he was thrilled.<br /><br />The set is neat. You build four blocks which can then be combined by using connectors. Really, you can build whatever you want. It has hidden chambers, two micro mini-figs (Steve and Creeper). It is mostly the smallest of LEGO pieces and does come with some extras (not a lot though).<br /><br />It is more expensive per piece (and size of piece) than a lot of LEGO sets but sometimes, it's okay to spend a little more for the things that make our kids really happy. And this does just that.<br /><br />There are now two other sets: [[ASIN:B00EJOCAYW LEGO Minecraft The Village 21105]] and [[ASIN:B00EJOCB4G LEGO Minecraft The Nether 21106]] that I think look pretty cool and may make a great Christmas gift for my daughter...<br /><br />When you compare this set to the smaller architecture sets, it is comparable in price.<br /><br />****UPDATE**** 4/6/2013<br />I just happened to stumble back to this review a couple of days ago and noticed that for a brief window, Amazon was carrying it in their warehouse (not through a reseller or fulfillment center) at $34.95. That was a great price. So I ordered another set for my daughter for her upcoming birthday. Unfortunately, it is back to being sold at much higher prices by resellers. The lesson learned, if you are looking for this set, keep checking back since it is evidently in production and sometimes available at list price through Amazon.<br /><br />Additionally, I had a buyer inform me that LEGO's website is now carrying it at the $34.99 price (plus shipping). I just went to confirm this and also see that they have a two per order limit.<br />**************s just that.

0670023329|4.0|The writing style is very readable, but it is the story that is truly amazing.<br />A rare glimpse into the juche totalitarian stalinist hermit kingdom (north korea)<br />If you had any doubts that Orwell's 1984 was prophecy of times to come, this read is for you.<br />The story itself focuses on a North Korean political prisoner born into \\"slavery and imprisonment\\" . Yes, you read right, born into...!<br />From this total inhumanity, springs worth the hope of escape, but only gradually.<br />With the possible craziest totalitarian dictatorship as the backdrop. Where life is cheap, mothers snitch on their sons, and vice versa, and executions are commonplace.<br />I actually rank this a strong 3,5 out of 5.<br />Amazing to think all this happened less then 10 years ago.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|This is a crisp and intellectual movie and the banter between Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey Jr) and the rest of the characters was funny and well written. Sherlock is on the top of his intellectual game and his detective skills are firing on all cylinders. His powers of observation and intuition are made to be amazing. This movie's pace speeds up throughout the film and it becomes an action motion picture with a deep plot and several sub plots.<br /><br />Sherlock appears throughout the movie in disguise as he believes that his mortal enemy, Professor Moriarity (Jared Harris) is constantly after him and wants to kill him. The world is on the verge of war between Germany and France as mysterious explosions occur in both countries and they are viewed and retaliation against each other for the terrorist's attacks sponsored by the governments. Holmes knows better as he has been tracking the events and he feels that the evil Professor is behind all of the murderous activities, bombings and attacks.<br /><br />Professor Moriarity is not only after Holmes but his partner investigator, Doctor Watson (Jude Law) and his new wife. Now Sherlock must try to stop a war in Europe, but also prove that the professor is the perpetrator and also protect his lifelong friend and ally....<br /><br />My wife and I enjoyed this movie. The plot is well written and as I have said the banter in the script is crisp and sharp and makes the movie more enjoyable. This film was made for entertainment purposes and it varies a lot from the original Sherlock Holmes character in that is does make Robert Downey Jr's character seem to almost having supernatural insight and perception. It is still a good movie and we enjoyed it.<br /><br />One scene detracted from the movie where a fight occurs between Sherlock and a Cossack assassin. The rubber knives the Cossack is using are flapping back and forth. This scene looks so fake and it should have been reshot and that error taken out of the movie. I don't understand how a film editor and the director could have left that scene in the film.understand how a film editor and the director could have left that scene in the film.

030758836X|1.0|I am an avid reader.  I am always looking for new things to read.  I came across this author and after reading the reviews, thought I'd give them a try.  I purchased all three books.  Unlike the other two titles available from this author, this book never went anywhere for me.  The other two were slow getting going, but once they got there, there was a great story.  This one was like a roller coaster who's track just ends at the peak of a hill.  I'm not really sure where the author was trying to go, but for me she just never got there.  I felt completely let down when I reached the last page, and honestly I felt cheated.  Please enjoy the other titles by this author but steer clear of this one, so you don't feel like you have wasted your time as I do.

B001FBIPF0|2.0|Let me first say that I am not really a pop-punk fan. Fall Out Boy, Panic! at the Disco, Taking Back Sunday, and All-American Rejects are odd exceptions in my music library, which primarily consists of punk, grunge, blues, and some 90's pop like Gin Blossoms and Semisonic.  In some ways, this may make me an outsider to the scene and unable to critique this album in a way which will be helpful to other listeners, but I also am less likely to be a blindly devoted fan of this band, as this album proves.  I have listened to Fall Out Boy for a long time, from \\"Evening Out With Your Girlfriend\\" through \\"Folie A Deux.\\"  My love for the band really only began to falter when they released their live album, which I felt was fairly underwhelming, particularly compared to the concert I attended back in 2008.  At the time, I wondered if I would actually like their next album, and my concerns were validated when I received my pre-ordered copy of Folie A Deux.<br /><br />  Since Fall Out Boy had already changed a lot between \\"From Under the Cork Tree\\" and \\"Infinity On High,\\" my disappointment with this album had nothing to do with them modifying their sound.  My main problem is that much of the music on this album sounds far too similar, and while much of Fall Out Boy's previous records also have this problem, usually they at least compensated with strong energy, some clever lines, catchy choruses, and some cool- if simple- guitar work.  On \\"Folie A Deux,\\" the role of the guitar is fairly understated, with a surprisingly heavy use of piano in a number of songs, and the result is a fairly subdued album.  While I don't particularly mind a milder album, I found most of the songs pretty forgettable, and a laid-back, unremarkable album, while not necessarily a terrible thing in itself, is very easily overshadowed by other stronger albums.<br /><br />  There were a few tracks that I thought were very good.  First of all, I thought that \\"Disloyal Order of Water Buffaloes\\" was a great opener, and I especially liked the line \\"And perfect boys with all your perfect lives/Nobody wants to hear you sing about tragedy.\\"  While this song was not as energetic as the openers from their previous albums, it still stood out to me as a good song, and the lyrics were very much what I had grown to expect from Fall Out Boy.  I also thought that the album had a strong middle with the songs \\"The (Shipped) Gold Standard\\" and \\"(Coffee's For Closers).\\"  The former especially stood out as one of the strongest choruses of the album.  Finally, the album ends on a strong note with \\"West Coast Smoker.\\"  I still have difficulty comprehending why the band used \\"I Don't Care\\" to try and establish their rock band credibility when they had such a cool, heavy closing song that didn't seem nearly so overladen with pop choruses and angst-ridden, victimized lyrics.<br /><br />  Interestingly enough, my overall impression of the album could be summarized as \\"an album with a strong beginning, middle, and end.\\"  However, it's tracks 2-5 and 8-12 that left me disappointed, not because they're terrible songs, but because they all sound like filler tracks to me.  After listening to the album, I was left with the impression that Fall Out Boy may have came up with four solid songs, realized that they all had a somewhat similar sound which could mark a change in musical direction for the band, and then proceeded to write nine more similar songs to fill out the album.  There are a couple of good tracks on here, but in my opinion, the listening experience was in no way enhanced by listening to the songs in the context of the entire album, despite the recurring musical elements which tie the album together.  Ultimately, my recommendation would be to listen to the samples of the tracks and purchase only the ones that really pull you in, and if your musical preferences are anything like mine, you'll be paying a lot less than if you bought the full album.

B002VHI8FE|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. It did take a while to become really interesting, but I think this was generally the characters being developed separately for them all to come together towards the end. There are well written, edge-of-your-seat fight scenes and the reader is given a deep insight into the diverse range of characters. The book finishes off with the promise of a good second to follow.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|All the movies in DVD, I now have room for 10 times more DVD's by switching out the VHS tapes for this great set. My Dad will love it!

0345803485|4.0|I read a number of different books by many different authors. These books were a very basic level reading, But I appreciate the books for what they are, an easy read. I didn't really enjoy the sex scenes in the book, I was more interested in the character development of Christian Grey himself. The second and third books were definetly a better read than the first one. I feel once you can look past the sex scenes and focus on the character development of the one character the book is actually good. I enjoyed reading them. I feel that the reason this book became so popular is because it is easy to read and understand. It does repeat itself quite a bit however. I have a friend who has never been interested in reading, she is by no means uneducated. She is 6 weeks from graduating from mortuary science school. I suggested this book to her and she read the first one in three days when she had free time, between school and three jobs. I can't call a book bad if it can captivate someone who never reads to actually take time from her to day to finish it. It will never be a literary master pieces but it draws people in, which i think is an amazing feet especially since I personally feel reading is becoming a thing of the past.<br />So in whole this book is good for what it is.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I enjoy this game its so much fun get it now its awesome. so addticting have fun get it get it
B008MEM24S|3.0|I'm not sure if I like this game<br /> I wish they had a free version that people could use to see if they like ot and want to buy it. over all it was pretty good :)
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|This app is very fun and if you have the app flow you go through different stages and they get harder as you go similar to flow in that aspect.
B0002KQNJU|5.0|I've always loved this movie from the first time I saw bits of it in the mid-seventies upon waking up mid-movie while it played on the late late show! For the longest time I didn't know what the movie was called and found it hard to describe it to people when I would try to find an answer. It was such and is still quite the twisted movie! This movie has committed to celluloid a very playful take on the Vampire saga. I wouldn't want to give much away, but if you like Mel Brooks' movie 'Young Frankenstein' as I stated in the title of this review, you'll probably enjoy this movie as well. I think that Roman Polanski did a great job both behind and in front of the camera. If your looking for some fun and fluff wrapped in a comedic Vampire movie, noone has out done this silly bit of cinema. Take care and enjoy!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Its a great app to play it can be hard at first but once you figure out how to do it its fun. I recommend this app for you
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is amazing I mean u could buy this one game and your set. I love this game. I mean games.
B008C0C1Y8|5.0|I love this film, i understand most didn't like it but for what it was it was really well made. my only gripe with the blu-ray is it's still the theatrical cut! being a cinephile i do lots of research on movies i love and have read in several magazines, the fangoria that features the film mentions a harder director's cut and even has great pictures from the film that are not in the final print. with the new film Dredd coming soon it looks like this would have been a great time to to the director's cut and add back all the extra violence to the film and give us some extras. i've seen pictures where dredd's brother rico is in the lab and those cool skinless clones bust free from the chambers and attack dredd, i really would love to see those scenes, the clones were very cool and creepy looking and bet it makes a great fight/ attack scene. maybe one day fingers crossed the studios will listen to the fans and give us what we want and not just upgrade the picture and sound and give us the deleted footage, documentaries and even commentary. the film is not as bad as everyone say, at least in my opinon, you may disagree and if you do god bless you, it's your given right to disagree and everyone likes what they like.
B008645YEE|5.0|...to the occasion as he does for all of his action scores.  Mr. Zimmer has composed an amazingly powerful and utterly intense score for Christopher Nolan's final Batman film.  I have already listened to this masterpiece of film music several times, and I love how it captures the dark and dramatic mood of Batman.  I can't help but smile as I listen to it!
B004NSVF7C|1.0|As a previous reviewer has pointed out, the title of this book is particularly delicious to anyone who is obsessed with books, not only as repositories of knowledge but as physical objects. For this type of person dreams of their ideal library and what it would contain and almost certainly has entertained the thought - however briefly - of stealing a book or two. And yet Hoover Bartlett's book in no way conveys the shear aesthetic and intellectual pleasure that books can bring. Throughout the work she admits to being puzzled by bibliomania and its dark twin, bibliokleptomania. Yet this is perhaps a result of her subject, John Gilkey. A puzzle to himself and all around him, his reasons for stealing books seem to vary with each passing mood. Yet there seems to be little real intellectual or aesthetic passion involved. Rather he steals for the supposed kudos that rare books can bring and he freely admits that his views of rare books were formed watching old British films and such things as Masterpiece Theatre. It would seem that for Gilkey books were mainly a way of decorating the background of his ideal self image - one of wealth and discernment, but without any real love of books for themselves. Essentially Gilkey is a boor and deeply boring. Unlike a far more prolific and interesting book thief such as Stephen Blumberg, Gilkey's story could have been told in a medium length magazine article. However, Hoover Bartlett feels the need to drag this paltry tale out to book length. This might have succeeded if she had a deeper insight into the broader subject of books and what drives people to steal them. But as already stated she finds herself constantly puzzled by the whole thing. She pads it out with reference to other notable book thieves, but it reads as exactly that: padding that sounds like a summary of wikipedia articles. Her style is atrocious and she seems to know very little about anything. And if, as I said, this could have been done as a magazine article, it would barely pass muster as a high school or freshman piece.
B007SGM084|2.0|Don't believe the hype.  The story line is weak at best and reduntly annoying at times.  Not worth the time.
B0063IH60K|4.0|The game works well and the advertisements are not overly intrusive. The format is suitable for both phones or tablet devices.
B007PS0X0W|2.0|From what I could watch of the movie it was good but the showing of it was poor quality, the movie jumped and skipped all the way through it or it looked grainy
B008MEM24S|5.0|I love this game and if u like the other game called where's my water app u will love this app.
B006VFLIYK|3.0|It was a classic Baldacci...I enjoy his writing, moves along but with unexpected turns...enjoyable summer reading material for any fan
B00009L1TA|2.0|The thought of trying to explain the plot of this movie is exhausting. In fact, I don't know if I could even if I tried. A bunch of soldiers go into the jungle; only two come out--maybe. Or maybe not. The plot twists and twists until it finally has no shape. Even if I could have understood it, the characters are given little-to-no development or backstory, so I simply didn't care what happened to whom or why. I'm a smart and patient viewer, but I felt like this movie wasted my time being convoluted instead of clever.
B0054N73EY|5.0|You know how you buy a CD for a favorite song and end up liking other songs on the CD better then that one, this is it for me. Glad I purchased it cause I now have new favs that I wouldn't have heard if I didn't.
B007V508CC|5.0|I love it and they're awesome in concert which they sang the songs from this album too. I listen to it a lot while driving.
B0015DYIH2|2.0|How did she even become an author? After reading her books I only found one word in the book that I did not understand. She writes simple things and I do not undertsand her ideas. She has developed characters and Bella is just stupid. How did she fall in love with a dude in like a month after starring at him? Her stories really suck and she should never be compared with a legend like Anne Rice.
B0061S073A|5.0|I have control of what and how long my child accesses my kindle!  I have had no issues on my kindle fire.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is a lot of fun and very addicting game and I would definitley recommend to anyone and everyone.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|fun fun fun. I love this game.its really fun for my daughter and I to play together. she love it.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|I first got introduced to this game by my grown daughter and her husband, and we played it at their house.  We loved the game and got addicted.  Ever since then, whenever they came to visit us they brought their Settlers of Catan board game with them, and we have gotten our whole family hooked!  After several years of this, my husband and I decided to buy our own set so we would have it here for all to play.<br />I have played board games with my kids since they were old enough to understand rules---it is a wonderful way to stimulate their minds and share some family time together.  Settlers has helped us continue that tradition into our kids' adulthood.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a favorite app of mine. I love that there is multiple ways to win a level.. all about how you think :)
B007EC27QM|5.0|Works perfectly. I tried a couple other free apps- this was by far the best value! It's very handy and easy to use. For anyone looking for calc apps this one easily does the trick!!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I read this book because it was #1 and I really feel like Amazon lied to me because clearly it is #2.<br /><br />The main character \\"Ana\\" says, OH MY to just about everything. Doesn't matter if she's been sexed fifty ways to Sunday, if Christian so much as winks at her, \\"Oh my.\\" It got to a point where I started hearing the words in George Takei's voice, which made the sex scenes a little odd for me.<br /><br />I really and truly believe this was some sort of social experiment someone set up, after the success of Twilight, to see if it was possible to market complete and utter garbage. Somewhere the author is cackling over how stupid Americans are as she presses everyone's money up against her body and moans \\"Holy Crap!\\"
B007N85ZXY|5.0|This is Neil Young at his best.  Moving forward, trying new things, not pumping out the same stuff over & over.  Kudos to Neil for a fun and rocking record that is an infusion of innovation mixed with tradition!!
B006VA3ZEG|5.0|I really can't overstate how much I love this show. I pretty much abandoned everything else happening in my life for a few days to watch the entire series. The characters are very endearing, and their relationships are dynamic and interesting. I also like how the show captures various political and historical events of the period.<br /><br />The streaming from Amazon worked flawlessly, even with HD!
B00846REIS|5.0|I am so glad I stumbled onto this book while cruising on Amazon. It is far and wide, multitudes better than Fifty Shades.<br />There really is no comparison... other than the millionaire thing.<br />I was in no way disappointed. Actually didn't want to stop reading. Unfortunately have to wait a few months for the sequel.<br />But I pre-ordered... so it's all good.<br />Enjoy!
B0051HNMTI|5.0|it was amazing I did it for thrity days and it gave me an amazing stomach I love this app well worth its cheap price of. 85 cents
B004J4WN0I|5.0|My Orthopedic Dr. suggested this series to me and I almost didn't start it, well I'm glad I did this was a really well written story, a lot of action and very witty, I had some really good laughs with this book. I enjoyed all the characters, I was always wondering who was playing who and which side everyone was on except of coarse Oberon and Atticus. I am going to purchase \\"Hexed\\" as soon as I finish writing this. Enjoy.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|i don't know were my life would be with out this app.  this app is so grate i use it every day. there just one thing i like the Android one better then the iPhone one i know it was first mad for apple but that just time so get this app if you  use Twitter Facebook and Google + your  love it and best of all it free for tall  os
034580404X|5.0|SO Awesome! I love these books. I bought them june 19th and am already on the third book. Im going to be sad when ive finished them. :(
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|There aren't the right words to describe the way this book made me feel. I was a complete mess while I read it, feeling each and every screwed up emotion along with the characters. I was grumpy one second and elated the next... what an amazing power Jamie McGuire has to evoke such visceral emotions in her readers.<br /><br />One word-AWESOME!!!
B007SGM084|1.0|Porn... poorly written, boring after the first 20 minutes, delusional (even for fantasy)= porn... and not even good porn.<br /><br />Stupid book, ridiculous price for a download and if you have friends... get one copy and share it... then toss it.  Worthless, redundant drivel.  I had better writing skills at age 10.
B0086700CM|5.0|Though the controls are very basic, and the story behind this game is very vague, I find this game exciting,  relaxing,  and great fun. If I were to say there was anything wrong with this game it would be that it is WAY too addicting, I have spent thirty-seven hours playing this game and I've only owned this application two days.<br />I hope everyone who has played this has enjoyed it because, this is the BEST GAME EVER!
B000059HGY|5.0|I like the remade aircraft of this movie. I like the scene were Lt. Tyler tells the radar operators, « well, don't worry about it » the ultimate understatement! There were several screw ups that could have given a little advance warning. The radar warning, the message from  Washington that was sent as a regular non urgent telegram, the sinking by the USS Ward of the Japanese midget sub ( which has been found by the way. It has a hole in the tower right where the Wards crew said it was. All of these were shown in the movie. One of my favorite scenes is when the USS Navada gets underway, is in the movie. The actors do a great job of protraying historical figures of both sides. I also like the fact that there are Japanese actors playing Japanese figures. A really good movie.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|It starts out simple. but then watch out - loads of fun figuring out the various patterns. But it can get addictive.
B000SC245E|5.0|Product was as advertised and worked fine.  Turned out not to be the problem.  Very prompt free shipping and handling.  Final cost of repair with 2 boards was about the price of a new printer.  Unfortunately, I already had +/- $350 worth of toner on hand and they wouldn't fit the new printer.
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|I found this book to be somewhat boring compared to The Da Vinci Code and Angels & Demons. It started out ok but quickly became dull and repetitive, but I forced myself to finish it because I bought it...twice. The first time I bought it I actually loaned it out before reading it myself to a friend (or so I thought) who ended up moving away suddenly and never responded to my attempts at getting it back. The second time I purchased it was on my Kindle. I was so pleased with Brown's previous Robert Langdon stories (mentioned above) that I thought, \\"How can I go wrong with another one?\\" It took rather a long time for Brown to make his point, which, to me, wasn't very clear or even that exciting to realize. And I could have done without the description of every single item and scene in the story. Details are great, but Brown was just way too wordy here. I was expecting a semi-fresh page-turner, but this was just too formulaic and a bit of a snoozefest.<br /><br />Aside from the several hundred pages of boring detail, I didn't like the characters that much either...even Langdon was kind of on my nerves, and he's the reason I decided to read it.<br /><br />I am not dismissing Brown's future work, and I am certainly interested in reading another Robert Langdon adventure if Brown decides to write one. I just wish I had liked this one, too.
034580404X|5.0|Books were awesome! Very intriguing. Love the story line, love the characters. Can't wait for the movie to come out! I'm totally hooked! :)
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Like the option of reading myself or listening to professional actor read the word! is Not a modern version! Great choices to use for Bible study.
B005K17RU0|5.0|this is a perfect weather app &amp; I think that I have tried almost all of them. It works exactly like it is supposed to &amp; it is very accurate.
B006UG90RM|5.0|If you are a VH fan...and you like the Fair Warning/Diver Down/1984 era without the keyboards, do yourself a favor and ignore the haters and buy this record. You wont be disappointed. Its that good. I wont go track by track however my favorites are You and Your Blues, As Is and Honeybabysweetiedoll. If you are a REAL VH fan, get it.
B000FA675C|4.0|This book to be honest was boring at frist but got better as i read onward. I like that plot,it made me think. Other than being sometimes a dry read it was a good book. The subject of this book I would think would be a big topic of disscotion. i learned several things.
1419703692|4.0|I pre-ordered this book 2 weeks ago and was waiting for the date it will release July 20. I got it the next day July 21st . And I didn't pay for fast shipping I paid 3 bucks, I guess they wanted people to get it for the weekend the movie came out, now for the book, it's beautiful from front to back. Janine pourroy help out in this book and it pain off well, Jody Duncan great also, they go over all the movie very well, the photots are nice I love the off camera ones, of them just going over things, If I had to say one thing is that I would have likes to see more on Anne as catwoman and I think if they would have cut the book into 4 parts , 1st 3 parts would be the movies in order, and 4th part would be a sum up of the book, what they have here is just all the movies mix into the book , one page may have photos maybe have pics from all 3 parts or just part 2 then later on part 1 ull see, I would have liked to just see all about part one 1st then 2 and 3 for me ,,, But if your a batman fan it's a must !!
B006BDHAX0|4.0|I like a lot the GAME, IT's REALLY  GOOD  but THE CRASHES. and the BLACK SCREEN  ARE REALLY ANNOYING!!! Please fix it, because the GAME DESERVES 5 STARS
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Excellent game. Very relaxjng.  Beautiful music and graphics.  Love how it helps your brain unwind. Definitely recommend if you are looking for a great game with different twist.
B004ZJZQ5G|5.0|A must own movie for fans of all ages. The cast choice was simply perfect and the information given in such a short time does not fail to live up to the standards of the book.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Nice app. I tend to like games that make me think and this one does. Some of the earlier levels may be a bit too easy though.
B0080OJBQW|3.0|I bought this album after the excellent reviews by most of the people on this site. I was a bit hesitant because his first album was such a massive disappointment to me, but I thought that I would give it a go again. Trespassing is better than the first, but a roaring success it is not. Adam has an incredible voice. My saying that is primarily from what I saw him do first on American Idol. However, he just doesnt use it well now that he is producing albums, and his tendency to shriek through many of his songs just leaves me cold. I've listened to \\"Trespassing\\" two or three times, and probably wont listen to it again.
0440241901|2.0|This book was so boring and predictable.  It is written in the same manner as \\"Bridget Jones Diary\\".  Same type of main character, same story problem, same solution.  I would not recommend it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is so fun and addictive.  You can play it without the timer or with.  In free play it's extremely relaxing if you enjoy thinking games.  Cant believe it's free!
B000JQUGVI|5.0|How pleasant to look again at Vanity Fait 40 and odd years later, this time in Kindle! The book has lost nothing of its original interest! I have read it as if I had forgotten its detailed story (as really happened). The story goes up a long way. A person today could think that many aspects regarding Becky could have been much more explicit, for instance that Amelia waited too long in believing in the memory of her husband (who really was a scoundrel).<br />But this book was written in those times and as such I report about it. It is full of ideas (Becky and Amelia, and the two families, and the rest,<br />Major Dobbin and all that, thoroughly mentioning all details). But, lo and behold: it is never tiring. It looks at the people with intense interest always, and I personally like the way this book goes on (remembering how old it is you see that this great story could not be told otherwise). All in all, for me reading again this book has been once more a great pleasure: Thackeray was a perfect writer of a long gone society, and as such he survives very well his time.<br /><br />(The first time I read it in 1965 in an edition that now I cannot read for my sight has certainly not improved!)
0345803485|1.0|I had to force myself through chapter 2. I could go no further. It is an endless monolog. Christian Grey is completely unlikeable. Who gives a crap if hes good looking? He is dry, boring, conceited, and narcissistic. I could care less how many butterflies his good looks may give me. I in no way wanted to get to know his character any better. Ana is also BORING, juvenile and completely unlikeable. The writing is horrid!! I am completely irked I paid 10 bucks for this book. I have no idea how it has found is way into the hands of so many enthusiastic readers. Want real heart pumping and great writing in the same genre try Cherise Sinclair.
B0086700CM|1.0|lots of glitches. kills me instantly and doesn't feel my finger when I swipe the screen to jump or slide.
0141189533|5.0|I grew up with Audrey Hepburn's film interpretation of Holly Golightly, a rather sanitized version of the heroine in the book.  I never read Capote's short story because I have a long, painful experience of disappointment in literature-translated-to-the-silver-screen.  It's always so sloppily done, and most of the times, the original story is butchered so badly (for reasons that Hollywood always fails to make convincing) it barely has anything to do with the film version.<br /><br />However, short stories fare better and this is an example.  The storyline is the same: lovely amoral country girl of poor beginnings runs away to New York City and turns into (sort of) glamour girl-about-town.  One can recognize the beautiful, sweet, unprincipled, and troubled girl from the book in Hepburn's sensitive portrayal of her.  Most of the secondary characters make it to the film version, though slightly edited.<br /><br />I'm not a critic or a psychiatrist so I'm not going to go into sheets of psychobabble about what Holly feels and thinks, and why, and how Capote's story contributes to society, if at all.  I see others here have already undertaken that chore, so I'll leave the rest to rely on their word.  I simply describe how stories I read impress me.  Unlike the film, with it's all's-well-that-ends-well ending, \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\", short story version, left a bitterer-than-sweet taste in my mouth.  Holly Golightly is most definitely an original character.  I find her amorality a good deal more pathetic and pitiful than censurable.  She's only 20 by the end of the story, and at that age we all think that we can do anything and nothing bad is ever going to happen to us.  Life's uncertainty takes on a more romantic aspect, especially in literature.  However, with the pragmatism of a woman past 50, I cannot help wondering with sadness what must have become of Holly once she lost the charms of youth and with that the ability to earn $50 \\"to go to the powder room.\\"  When middle-age, with its usual problems, health-related and otherwise, set in,(if she lived that long).  Nevertheless, it's an interesting story, and I do recommend people to read it.  But, as someone else advised, watch the film first.<br /><br />As for the famous \\"money for the powder room\\" that intrigues people, I think I understand what Capote refers to.  Way back in time, ladies' restrooms were known as \\"powder rooms.\\" Powder rooms in restaurants and bars, etc., especially the posher kind, used to have \\"helpers.\\" (I cannot, of course, vouch for the gentlemen's version). These were employees who would provide customers with towels, safety pins, tissues, and other similar needs.  Customer would leave \\"tips.\\"  I suspect that when girls like Holly would ask their gentlemen friends for \\"money for the powder room\\" they were given $30 or $50, of which they would give maybe one as tip to the helpers and keep the rest.  Call it a \\"fee.\\"  I could be wrong, but I think that is the gist of it.

Receiving this as a gift was intended as a joke. Joke is on the giver.<br /><br />As for the songs, I had no problems with the quality of the recording, I felt the channels were separated well. I was able to pick out every part. Simon has managed to keep his voice in amazing condition and the band swept through their hits with seamless precision. I felt their CHOICE of songs was the biggest suspect here. I really did not need \\"View to a Kill\\" or \\"Notorious\\". \\"Save a Prayer\\" is a sinful omission. However, that is simply one fan's preference.
B00003JRCQ|1.0|boring from beginning to end. I tried not to fall asleep while watching it. Watched once never again would waste my time.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great game, as afore described, highly addictive.  Thanks to my son for downloading it for me, now I can't put it down!
B0087240Z4|5.0|I was not expecting much from the new Smashing Pumpkins album, but I really like it.  It reminds me of Mellon Collie & The Infinite Sadness as it has some slow song mixed in with some rocking songs.  Overall, it is one of the albums which sounds better the more you listen to it which is rare in these days of digital downloads.
B000K8EQ5W|5.0|Just finished watching htis movie, Keanu & Sandra are So Good Together! I've seen them in a couple of movies Together they have such Good Chemistry between them! I know this movie was released in 2006 and it's 2012 ...So I'm a little behind LOL...BUT I REALLY REALLY ENJOYED IT VERY MUCH!!!
B007SGM084|5.0|I loved these books and read all 3 of them in 4 days.  I couldn't put the book down. Downloaded on my Kindle to read while camping.  I had to keep the lantern going late at night to finish reading.  People who decide not to read because of the steamy sex scenes in first book are missing out.  Very great book and would read any new books by the author. Highly recommend.[[ASIN:B007SGM084 Fifty Shades Trilogy Bundle: Fifty Shades of Grey; Fifty Shades Darker; Fifty Shades Freed]]
0345803485|5.0|I had mixed feelings about getting this book because of all the different reviews that I had been reading but for me it was a great read I enjoyed it so different from what I normally read I usually suspence and thrillers but I thought I would give this a try and so glad that I did. Enjoyed that I bought the other two books in the trilogy so can not wait to read and see how there story ends up . I highly recommend this book if u want a good Erotic romance novel just to get away from the normal stuff u read . Again I so enjoyed this book will be a book trilloy I read again when I want to venture from the stuffthat I normally read.
B0034G4P94|5.0|I was afraid to watch this movie because of the fighting scenes (especially as a woman), but every fight was done in a way that was palatable yet the brutality was evident. I was won over by the individual characters and the three Conlon men.  Every actor was effective and believable. Hardy and Edgerton gave it more than anyone I know could have to physically transform.  But Tom Hardy killed it as Tommy Conlon.  You can read any other item description, but take this with you:  if you want to be moved by realistic emotions, actions, and reactions, you will win with this movie.  Tom Hardy, Joel Edgerton, and Nick Nolte were brilliant.  Hardy deserved some serious awards for his performance.  Watch the special features so you can see what these men put themselves through to bring their characters to our attention. I am back in the gym because of these guys.  Thank you!  SPOILER KIND OF: The final fight with Tommy and Brendan and the music and Tommy breaking down...I cried.  Have sweatshirt sleeve, a box of tissue, or a best friend's shoulder to cry on.  God bless those shoulders!
B0086QS7N2|5.0|While other great bands cash in on their early fame and personalities, Rush is doing something strange.  These artists are actually continuing to create art in the form of albums.  New work which adds to the legacy of a great band.  I know when I see them live this year that these songs will hold up to the classics.  I have enjoyed listening to Clockwork Angels and it gets better the more I listen to it the way good albums should.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I don't really know why I love this game but I do.I play it every day even though sometimes it is boring.
B0077PBPJ6|4.0|the acting in this movie was outstanding, but you must be prepared for the onslaught of image after image of the horrors of war.<br />i was not; i thought the emphasis would be on the romance (also doomed) but it really is about how hideous war is.<br />this is not the movie i thoght i was getting, but that's my own fault because i never read the book and it just sounded<br />interesting and entertaining, and i love english film.  and the methods of war dring WW1 were horrifying.  since i'm claustrophoic some of the scenes in the<br />mines really jolted me.  but ... it is very well done and the actors are very convincing.  if you like war movies, you will get<br />your fill in this one.

B004LWZWGK|4.0|After years of not being Batman (Christian Bale), Bruce Wayne must come out of retirement to stop a mad man named Bane (Tom Hardy) who wants to destroy Gotham. Batman may be outmatched this time though and needs the help of resourceful cat burglar Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway). As well as Blake (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a promising young cop who's one of the only who believes Batman didn't kill Harvey Dent.<br />  The plot is much deeper than I make it sound but it's hard to get into more without giving too much away. Does the film live up to all the hype though ? Yes, since it is from Christopher Nolan and there is plenty of excitement and twists but Dark Knight was still better since this one is much slower. The strongest things about this one is the Batman and Catwoman scenes and Tom Hardy's intimidating and scary performance as Bane.<br /> However, despite being a really good film,  everything isn't wrapped up in one great package, 3 films isn't enough when so many villains were yet to be seen in Nolan's Batman films and there's so much more that could be explored, even the ending made me want more and when I say more, I don't mean a reboot. The end leaves more possibilities than Nolan intended.
034580404X|5.0|I bought the set as a gift to myself and to wonder what all the hype was about, when I first placed the order there was a slight delay, in which I thought would be long before I get the set but was amazed how quickly I received them! I so thank you!! I sure would buy more from you!!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game becouse you can play without pumping more and more money into it to play and there are fun mini games too
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|There seem to be a lot of bad reviews on this book compared to the first two.  I thought the book was very good, I'd like to say more but I don't want to spoil it. Moreover, I thought the ending was very good.  Then again I read a lot of King books and a lot of his endings are horrible.  All in all I thought it was a great book in the trilogy, and it'll make for a good movie.
0553801473|4.0|With A Dance with Dragons, the 5th novel of A Song of Ice and Fire, there is a sense that George R.R. Martin has instilled a few too many plotlines. As there are so many characters doing so many things, it makes me wonder if the story will ever be wrapped up in my lifetime. Despite this fact, I still finished A Dance with Dragons with more of a positive outlook than others might. I'd also like to point out that I was spoiled before I read this book, so whatever preconceptions or hopes I had were quickly washed away before I read even the first pages. As such, I feel like I was able to enjoy it for what it was.<br /><br />After killing his father in cold blood, Tyrion has left King's Landing to go east in search for Daenerys Targaryen. The talk is she is in Meereen preparing her army and growing her dragons in order to invade Westeros. As Tyrion makes his journey, he also goes through his own personal growth as he must cope with his killing of Tywin and Shae. Daenerys is having her own troubles controlling Meereen. Many different forces seem to be conspiring against her, and her rule is on the verge of being overturned. She is having to watch herself in everything she does. One wrong move, and she is done for. Meanwhile up north, Jon Snow is having a tough time getting the Night's Watch to accept the Wildings past the Wall, not to mention Stannis and Melisandre are both there as an added threat. Other plots emerge from Bran as he continues his journey north of the Wall, from Reek trying to find out what his name in his past life was, and from Arya who continues her own training to become an assassin. Of course there are several other point of view characters, as is GRRM's way.<br /><br />Tyrion, Daenerys, and Jon are the three that push this narrative forward. They each go through their own transformations. Tyrion never really seemed like himself this time around, but I can let that past as I didn't really expect him to be his jolly 'ol self after killing two peoplehe knew quite well (or, at least, thought so). Dany and Jon both learn that ruling over a lot of people isn't quite what it seems, and everything they decide to do just wouldn't work. Both of them are really put through the ringer as they fail time and time again. Martin definately understands the concept of having your characters fail before they succeed. On another note, the couple of chapters from Bran were just downright beautifully written. Martin was at his best in writing these; I just wish there had been more of it.<br /><br />Despite all this, A Dance with Dragons is still really faulty. The first half of the novel was slow in building up its tension, and the second half seemed to have no narrative coherence. Chapters appear from characters like Jaime and Cersei without really accomplishing anything. And while there isn't an anti-climax in regards to the internal struggles, any fights or battles that might be expected never happened. There's a sense that Martin dug himself into a hole, and while I believe he has found his way out, there was no way that he was going to get out in just a novel's time. For a while I've been wondering if anything could have been done to the structure of A Dance with Dragons to give it a more satisfactory ending, but I really couldn't figure out anything that would work. The cliffhanger in Winterfell is well used, in my opinion, and wouldn't change that. It is the cliffhanger in Meereen, though, that I wish could have been better resolved. Unfortunately, I think it is quite obvious that Battle of Meereen would simply be too long. I can honestly see it taking up half of the next book.(Hopefully Martin decides to showcase the battle without pausing to go elsewhere. It would make for an exciting few hundred pages to see him go through the four or so point of view characters and no one else.)<br /><br />Through all its faults, I still liked the book. I thought it was entertaining, though not on the level of A Game of Thrones, A Clash of Kings, or A Storm of Swords. I am remaining optimistic and feel confident that Martin has figured out the Meereenese knot and, as such, will get The Winds of Winter out in the next two years. He has a lot of work to do, though, with all these different characters. It's about time he kills off a few of them (and keeps them dead).<br /><br />I'm not sure people will enjoy A Dance with Dragons. It is a lot of build up but not much else. I enjoyed it for what it is -- another piece of a very long story. Very long.<br /><br />3.5/5
B008MEM24S|5.0|Love it. Makes you think and figure things out. Best kind of app. Could play this for hours and only accept 3 ducks as an outcome.

B0071PS7AC|4.0|It's a fun game to play.  I've played a few of the bowling games and this one is much smoother and more realistic than the other games.  It tends to be a little boring but it was only a dollar.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Great game.  I like it better than Where is My Water.  I bought it for my daughter, but I play it as much as her.
0596809158|4.0|As others have said, this has lots of useful stuff in it. But dont use it as a statistics guide. The section on testing for mean reversion in time series is really just about how to use the ADF test. There is a good deal more to mean reversion than this. Likewise I noticed an assertion that a high adjusted R-squared is unambiguously a good thing. Time series people should know better. Having had the book for just a day I am pretty certain I'll find other minor bloopers to complain about.<br /><br />Otherwise, a very useful contribution

B0087DFIOU|5.0|Get the Gringo was a blast to watch!  Mel Gibson doing what he does best, action movies with a twist, and great production values.<br /> This movie reminds me a lot of Sam Peckinpah's style with  Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia and The Wild Bunch.  I will watch this one for the attention to details that Mel brings to his movies. If you like action flick shoot em ups, you need to.......Get The Gringo!  Listen for the quote of the movie \\"bingo  gringo\\"  priceless!

B001N1DPDE|5.0|I just purchased the BK2 from Amazon. I have never had a knife like this one before. Built like a tank. I think you would have to put it on train tracks to destroy it. I modified the sheath and put the clip on the other side of the sheath for left handed use. For some reason I use my left hand for handling knives and guns. I removed the nylon part of the sheath and ordered a Tek Lok. I also put inner tubing on the handle for better grip. I got the idea from an uploaded photo of a BK2 customer. The blade came pretty sharp. Made in the USA!
B008N1V11U|5.0|Cant believe im the first to review this. Gameloft strikes gold again only this time with Batman! Gamelofts Amazing Spiderman was beyond impressive. for a mobile game but this takes it a step further and since its Batman following The Dark Knight Rises storyline the story itself is so much better. The gameplay is like that of arkham Asylum or arkham City only gazed on events from Nolans film. Great gameplay and graphics and without a doubt the best mobile. game around for tablets and smartphones. Gameloft just keeps pushing the envelope

0345803485|5.0|Could not put it down!  This book is very well written.  It makes you want to read more and more.  It's basically one big giant teas  The mixture between the main characters is perfect because they are so opposite of each other in many ways, but are deeply attracted to each other.  There are many email exchanges which I also loved, it almost felt like reading someone else's personal email (as if I was snooping, LOL) Loved it and will definately read books two and three.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I read all three 50 Shades of Grey books, and all were fantastic! I can't pick one over the other, except to say that the first one has the best sex scenes out of the three. I was really down when I finished the last one. I hope she writes more of these. Slightly disappointed with the end of the third book, but totally satisfied over all.

0142418471|4.0|This is the story of two teenagers named Will Grayson.  Will Grayson #1 is pretty much a normal teenager with normal teenage problems.  The thing that stands out most about him is his larger than life gay best friend, Tiny Cooper.  Will Grayson #2 has no real friends.  He's depressed to the point where he has to be medicated.  He's dark and brooding and thinks about dying a lot.  A chance meeting one night will change the two Will Graysons lives forever.<br /><br />I find it interesting that each Will Grayson was written by a different author.  I liked that it was done this way and think it made each voice more authentic.  Tiny Cooper made the story though.  He was just larger than life in every way.  You couldn't help but love him even if he was a bit annoying sometimes.  So as not to give anything away, let's just say this is a story about love, friendship, and acceptance.  It's written for teenagers and that is obvious.  However, I have some friends that would have some real issues giving this book to their teenagers.  There is bad language, underage drinking, talk about masturbation and sex, and of course the sexuality aspect.  I don't have a problem with this and think these are things that normal teenagers deal with everyday and would give this to my stepson to read if he was was interested.  I just wanted to put it out there for those that do have issues with the content.
030758836X|2.0|Were it not for all the hype I would never have finished this.  The first half of this too long book moves at a snail's pace and isn't all that interesting.  As for the much ballyhooed \\"twists and turns,\\" I was expecting more.  Lame ending, but all things considered these two truly deserved each other.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This is the worst piece of trash I've ever read. My four year old son could dictate to me a more compelling love story. I ordered this $10 romance garbage on my Kindle Fire trusting in the hype. I'm half tempted to burn my Kindle Fire for ever harboring such a joke of what is being marketed as a must read. The fact that my peers eat this up astounds and saddens me. No wonder divorce is rising into the 60%. You poor woman are feeding into this CRAP. Men aren't like this. No self respecting man is. Do you really think a billionaire would bother with such an ordinary girl who works in a HARDWARE STORE? I get the Author trying to emphasize the characters innocent and inexperienced nature but COME ON! It came off as ordinary and laughable. UNBELIEVABLE!! I couldn't believe in any of the characters. I couldn't get the image of a sad middle aged house wife tapping on the key board feeding out all her sub/dom fantasies. These are definitely thoughts that should be left in ones head. They a neither entertaining nor artistic. I am sickened I didnt do my research and I mistakenly supported this FLOP. I  should have known better as a seasoned reader.

0062059882|5.0|Look at all that's been said about Neil Gaiman's American Gods! And look yet again! HBO and Tom Hanks are making it as a miniseries! WHO'S GOING TO PLAY MR. WEDNESDAY? SHADOW? LOW KEY?<br /><br />Listen: this is an absolutely splendid batch of angular ideas transposed into a ripping yarn. If you've already read the book, we're probably in agreement. If you haven't, it will be much more pleasurable for you to know - like me at the outset - absolutely nothing about the novel before embarking with Shadow and Mr. Wednesday on their picaresque adventures, replete (of course) with a wonderful menagerie of characters encountered along their way to...uh...well...G&ouml;tterd&auml;mmerung (maybe). (I don't think that constitutes a spoiler, doe it?)<br /><br />You'll make your own sense of it as you go along. I don't think you have to be a lover of any particular fantasy genre or literary genre to enjoy this one. For those who take special delight in surprise, in unusual but well wrought plot turns, in powerfully drawn characters, in the implausible made rather plausible, this will be quite the ticket.<br /><br />Just read it.

B000SLP4SE|1.0|Wahlberg- he's a good actor, though I agree with another reviewer that he mumbles his lines below audible.  I had to look up the script (since Amazon has no subtitles).  Danny Glover's pretty good- plenty of good actors.<br /><br />But this movie is a tattered rag of a storyline.  Wahlberg's character, \\"Swagger\\", apparently having not heard of the internet, burns evidence, explaining the futility of trying to make it public -<br /><br />\\"You hand it over to the authorities,<br />it's just gonna disappear, along with us!\\"<br /><br />What the hell?<br /><br />Then he's inexplicably set free by the FBI because, well that's not explained, and this after he's somehow handed an enormous cartridge for his sniper rifle sitting on a meeting table, by a rogue FBI agent who helped Swagger, and who should be in custody himself, and after he loads it and aims it around the table, even pulls the trigger to show it's not functioning. Absolute Keystone cops. But Swagger is indeed set free to take revenge and blow up a house to smithereens in just seconds by opening up the gas stove line.  Then.. well that's about all there is, because well I'm not sure but I guess since he put the gun in Glover's dead hands, the police will think that Glover turned on the gas and shot himself (from a distance)... I dunno,  I really can't remember such a shoddy screenplay.  I blame Johnathan Lemkin, and vow to avoid movies he write from here on out.  I didn't read the book this is based on, Point of Impact by Stephen Hunter.  I can't believe it's that bad.  I also blame the director, Antoine Fuqua, who also did Training Day, another sub-par film with great actors.  How they get these stars to sign on is a mystery.<br /><br />I think an entire internet site could be devoted to the holes in this film, but since it's just a random, bogus B-movie, it's better to just let it go.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is the first John Green novel I have read and really had no idea what to expect considering that I knew the story dealt with cancer and I was already familiar with him from his Youtube channel \\"The Vlog Brothers\\". Nerdy humor about cancer? Well, yes there was quite a bit of that, but what I was not prepared for was the level of writing and humanity in TFiOS. The story was beautiful, honest, and every bit as joyous as it was heartbreaking. The characters were vivid and clear and full of enough faults and strengths to make them enchantingly real. And that nerdy cancer humor offered a candid look at the world through the eyes of someone terminally ill. I've lost someone dear to me, not from cancer, but an equally horrific illness, and I found TFiOS to capture all the love, futility, pain, and beauty of an heroic human spirit battling it's way out of it's broken, failing container. This is a profound book full of humanity and depth that will be well worth rereading from time to time.

1451683405|4.0|The definition of Free Will used here is that of philosopher Gordon H. Clark (1961). Religion, reason, and revelation. Presbyterian and Reformed Pub. Co, p. 203. \\"Free will has been defined as the ability under given circumstances, to choose either of two courses of action. Whatever motives or inclinations a man might have, or whatever inducements may be laid before him, that might seem to turn him in a given direction, he may at a moment disregard them all and do the opposite.\\"<br /><br />Sam Harris' book is devoted to demonstrating this definition is contrary to fact. He provides many examples to show that what we decide is affected by factors we are unaware of. He points out we are programmed by influences ranging from genes to our upbringing, and this programming affects our decisions. He points out that who we are today is not the same as yesterday for reasons that maybe nobody can determine, so our decisions today are not those we would make at another time.<br /><br />So we may conclude that the definition of Free Will above exaggerates our competence in decision making. \\"Free Will\\" is one of those terms that needs to be dumped in favor of a more realistic terminology.<br /><br />Sam Harris says: \\"There is no question that human beings can imagine and plan for the future, weigh competing desires, etc.  - and that losing these capacities would greatly diminish us.\\" \\"However, these phenomena have nothing to do with free will.\\" He goes on through a personal example to suggest that the ability to be rational and formulate matters doesn't mean you have the capacity to put the plan into action. Nonetheless, Sam Harris says, you can choose to do something: \\"Of course you can create a framework in which certain decisions are more likely than others - you can, for instance, purge your house of all sweets, making it very unlikely that you will eat dessert later in the evening - but you cannot know why you were able to submit to such a framework today when you weren't yesterday.\\"<br /><br />So, Sam Harris seemingly believes that understanding our limitations can lead to better actions, which makes the reading of this book at least potentially useful. Apparently we have the freedom to analyze our situation, and somehow that analysis can change our programming, so our uncontrollable moment-by-moment responses become more in keeping with who we want to be, although not actually under our immediate control. If we can't make this analysis and adjust our programming ourselves, society can do it for us and (for example) whack us into an AA program where we will be reprogrammed.<br /><br />Sam Harris suggests that: \\"You can do what you decide to do - but you cannot decide what you will decide to do.\\" \\"My choices matter - and there are paths toward making wiser ones - but I cannot choose what I choose.\\"<br /><br />These statements need semantic clean-up to make some sense.<br /><br />There are some unconnected dots here, and Sam Harris dumps it in the reader's lap.  Basically, framing the matter as free will (complete autonomy) versus no freedom at all is a false dichotomy, that is, a pretense that there are only two alternatives, when something in between is more accurate. What Sam Harris does here is to point out this fallacy, and outline our limitations.<br /><br />But unfortunately he doesn't examine what freedom we do have with any clarity.esterday.\\"<br /><br />So, Sam Harris seemingly believes that understanding our limitations can lead to better actions, which makes the reading of this book at least potentially useful.

0060936223|3.0|I love learning about cultural history (or really any history) through literature. \\"Just Kids\\" by Patti Smith is the second rock and roll memoir I've read (the first was \\"Life\\" by Keith Richards) and just as edifying.<br /><br />\\"It was my entrance into the radiance of imagination.\\"<br /><br />JK is about poet, artist, and rocker Patti Smith and artist and photographer Robert Mapplethorpe, \\"a young man with nothing but glory in his grasp,\\" as they go from being just kids to artists of great renown.<br /><br />\\"I noticed I was praying to the beat of my feet.\\"<br /><br />JK is not only a tribute to their love, romantic, platonic, artistic, everlasting, but also to the pursuit of art as a calling.<br /><br />\\"Fill the wound we had opened to let other experiences in.\\"<br /><br />And it's a magnificent portrait of the \\"shifty and sexual\\" city of New York in the 60's and 70's, as seen through the lenses of music, art, drugs, sexuality, and ambition.<br /><br />\\"He noticed his own breath like the breath of a collapsing god.\\"<br /><br />Until reading JK, I never understood the mystique of Clinton Street (which figures in so many songs) and the Chelsea Hotel (another massive cultural icon) or even Patti Smith herself who invents an entirely new art form that blends poetry, rock and roll, and art, and leads inexorably into the punk rock generation.<br /><br />\\"My room reflected the bright mess of my interior world, part boxcar, part fairyland.\\"<br /><br />I did often get jogged out of the book because of repetition and uneven text, despite its brisk pace, fascinating story, and many many moments of gorgeous poetry (which only goes to show that everyone, even an accomplished poet, needs editing). And I felt the name dropping and references bordered on tediousness. Here's an example of said awkwardness:<br /><br />\\"I had never listened closely to Lou Reed's lyrics, and recognized, especially through the ears of Donald, what strong poetry they contained.\\"<br /><br />Still, JK isa fast read, and would delight anyone interested in the birth of punk rock, in the elevation of homoeroticism in art as per Mr. Mapplethorpe's gorgeous black and white vistas, in blended genres by (literally) starving artists, in a really beautiful love story that withstands even changing sexualities, in NYC's cultural history, and in Ms. Smith's relentless drive to make a difference in the world and to do it with art.<br /><br />\\"Pioneers without a frontier, as Andy Warhol would say.\\"

B007J4T2G8|1.0|This is probably the most boring book I have ever read!  Do not waste your money to read it.  I will not buy the other two books in this trilogy.  I was expecting a love story with romance and sensuality, but this read like someting a 13 year old would write.  Bad, bad attempt on the part of the writer!  Like I said, don't waste your money!!!
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I love this game and I love how there are levels so I feel like I can try and beat all the levels instead of just playing over and over.  Great game! !!!

0670022411|5.0|I was very  entertained and could hardly put the book down to sleep. I felt it was an adult version of the vampire novels. There was romance and violence but not gratuitous sex and violence. The S & V fit the story. The end left me wondering what would happen next. I loved the book and so did my friend.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|i have my own village cone visit...the need of acorns makes it annoying... but overall happy with the concept...Its worth the download

B000FBFN1U|5.0|My Review:<br />I'm actually quite speechless! So many ups and downs in this book, from the beginning to the epilogue, it's amazing! If you haven't started on the 'A Song of Ice and Fire' series yet, start, because reading to get to this book alone is reward in itself. It starts off really tame as the characters just go through the motions of travel, but advances a little over halfway through, dramatically. There were several times when I had to stop because I felt all the emotions between sadness, bitterness and, well, angry. GRRM plays with his readers like kids play with toys, as he directs us to believe things one way, and then jerks us to believe the opposite. A Storm of Swords could really be alternatively titles A Mock of Marriages, as there are so many in the book. The development of his characters in this book are astounding and in depth as he delves forward to releasing more of the truth of their souls.<br /><br />Thoughts on A Storm of Swords main characters:<br /><br />Arya: Arya is all over the place. Once people find out what she may be worth she unknowingly starts moving all over Westoros, when all she wants to do is go home; that is if her mom will take her. This seems to be her constant worry, that her mother and Brother Robb won't accept her if they knew all the sins she's committed. I believe she'll be alright in that aspect... she's only trying to survive after all. She seems to be well in control of her life choices and actions. I have loved seeing Arya's character grow within the last two books, A Game of Thrones and A Clash of Kings, and her adventures in this book didn't fail to astonish me as well.<br /><br />Davos: I didn't care for him in A Clash of Kings, and I don't care for him in this book either. I assume he's being introduced into this series because he later has a large part in everything, other than being GRRM's puppet to show what's going on in the realm of Stannis Baratheon and Melissandre.<br /><br />Sansa: If Arya's trying to survive with sins (as she believes), Sansa's trying to survive with good deeds. Also, in contrast to her sister, Sansa seems to have no control over her life whatsoever. She's grown on me so much within these last two books, and I admire her for her strength and pity her for her constant downfalls. I was a bit peeved at her character for being so stuck up in A Game of Thrones, but I've now come to the realization \\"What would I do if I were in her position?\\" Honestly, I can't see myself pulling an Arya and daring to escape the walls of King's Landing, so I'm sure I'd end up in Sansa's position. I do, however, feel she's a bit superficial in her daydreams of love and being a wife and should mature in that factor, but upon further thinking: she's young, and being in her hostage situation daydreams are all she really have.<br /><br />Tyrion: Tyrion is always an interesting character, and puts himself in interesting, if not compromising, situations. Having to follow the orders of his Father, Lord Tywin, and knowing more of his familial back history, I sympathize with him. With all he's been through he's seem to lost a lot of his power in the realm as well as, dare I say it, his wit. I somehow feel he's getting a bit depressed, and not just because he's an `imp'. I'm really quite glad that he's appearing in all the books so far, because I'd feel quite lost in the book without him.<br /><br />Catelyn: A strong mother who keeps taking hit after hit. Everybody is leaving her, whether through death, war, shunning or maturing. All of her faith in this book lies in hands of Brienne, but even she has no contact with the gallant woman. She cares for her son, Robb, but knows she must let him make his own decisions, and obey him as he tries to find a way to win the war. Although she witnesses the mistakes of her loved ones, Catelyn tries to go for the positive and inwardly think of solutions to mend the situations. Everything Catelyn does and thinks of is out of an act of love and vengeance for the family she has left, although there are situations that even she cannot mend.<br /><br />Bran: Bran is searching for a three eyed crow. As absurd as this sounds, I see the symbolism in that Bran is actually looking for himself; learning more and more about himself as the journey continues. His gift is very useful in the survival of Jojen, Meera, Hodor, and himself, as he channels his inner wolf, among other things.<br /><br />Jon: Apparently Jon Snow doesn't know anything, still. As it is repeated over and over and over again in this book. Perhaps Jon is still clearheaded on his goals, which leads him to temptation and deception. I do believe Jon wants to be an honorable man of the Night's Watch but in reality, if he wasn't so caught up on him being bastard-born, he would like to have a wife and family one day. Towards the ending of his storyline I was thinking, wow, this is like Harry Potter and Goblet of Fire lol! But I'm sure Jon will get it together.<br /><br />Daenerys: I feel Daenerys is becoming very arrogant, although I do love seeing the display of Women Power. I think she feels she can do whatever she pleases, even if it means hurting those most loyal to her to obtain her prize. More so, I feel that she should think more before she acts. Going off of the visions other's have set for her are not enough; she needs to have visions of her own.<br /><br />Jaime: Seeing things from his perspective has brought me to really like Jaime. What goes through his mind, and how he evaluates situations are interesting and can be quite endearing. I've started to see him as sort of an emotional wreck when it comes to Cersie, as she just uses him like a pawn in her game. Strip The Kingslayer of his walls and you'll find a man of heart, yearning and family pride.<br /><br />Samwell: I believe he can be courageous, he's just afraid of bravery. I can see that he can be quite smart, when it comes to things unrelated to fighting, and if he could stop and think once in a while instead of surviving off anxiety, he can be somewhat of a leader. He needs to put the past abuse of his father behind him to find his courage and strive. There are more than just the physical type of brave, there's mental as well.<br /><br />-------------<br />Quotes:<br />\\"'Some battles are won with swords and spears, others with quills and ravens.'\\" (50)<br /><br />\\"'A fat man always sits comfortably, I am thinking for he takes his pillow with him wherever he goes.'\\" (112)<br /><br />\\"Gendry looked almost a man grown, and dangerous. Hot Pie looked like Hot Pie.\\" (145)<br /><br />\\"'Old stories are like old friends, she used to say. You have to visit them from time to time.'\\" (279)<br /><br />\\"'Sometimes I think everyone is just pretending to be brave, and none of us really are. Maybe pretending is how you get brave, I don't know.'\\" (370)<br /><br />\\"'Wedding have become more perilous than battles, it would seem.'\\" (711)<br /><br />\\"Robb had become a hero king; if Jon was remembered at all, it would be as a turncloak, an oathbreaker, and a murderer.\\" (830)engeance for the family she has left, although there are situations that even she cannot mend.<br /><br />Bran: Bran is searching for a three eyed crow.

6304696558|4.0|Goldie Hawn once confessed to Oprah that \\"Private Benjamin\\" was a \\"once in a lifetime \\" role and she makes the most of it The part of a Philadelphia socialite turned Army Career Gal is perfect for Hawn's ditzy, sweet personna. As Judy Benjamin becomes less naive, Hawn does a masterful job in keeping her vunerable and sweet. This is the kind of role that Reese Witherspoon would play today, although less successfully.  Though the going gets a bit slow in the film's second half, Hawn and a stellar supporting cast including Mary Kay Place, Sam Wanamaker, Barbara Barrie, and Oscar-nominated Eileen Brennan keep the laughs coming.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I tested Evernote,  springpad and catch.<br />Catch cannot compete,  Springpad is a bit more intuitive but Evernote simply has the better functionality.<br />Admitted,  it isn't  easy,  you have to sit down and study but once you've  got it there's nothing better :)
B003H8WSLQ|5.0|For their second album, Foals wanted perfection. I believe they pretty much did it. I love how it isn't their first album and they grew so much as muscians and for Yannis, a poet. I can't give you long paragraphs to describe this music. It is all subjective for the individual, rigth? We wouldn't have crap like Katy Perry, if someone did think she is a good artist. In my opinion this music is amazing and beautiful. This album is my favorite from the year it was release. They need to get busy already and get their third on out. Um, their third original album out, if you know what I mean.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|This is a poigant love story and the obessions that can occur with love and abuse.  Anatasia a graduting senior meets Mr. Grey by accident when her best friend and roommate falls ill the day of Mr. Grey's interview for the school newspaper.  Both Anatasia and Mr. Grey are smitten at first site.  Her insecuity in herself attracts him thinking her would make a perfect partner in his sexaul fanatasy world of S&M.  She is drawn to him like a moth to a flame.  She is determined to find out what secrets he hides and he is finding out that she has bewitched him and he feels he can't live without her.<br /><br />This is not a book for everyone.  If you are squirmish about the world of S&M find another book there is open discussion of this world and the techniques used.  I am looking forward to beginning the next book and seeing where these people's lives lead them.

B000WTXCZO|4.0|The Allman Brothers are a great live band with very talented musicians and this is a good album to show what they were capable of. If you were lucky enough to see them in the beginning then you know how they filled the stage and the room. Duane was one of the best guitar players of all time, and with Dickie Betts to compliment it was captivating.Two sets of drums made a full sound you can feel and Greg's voice and songs were a perfect fit. Sit back, turn up the volume and enjoy.

B007SGM084|5.0|I had heard this trilogy was a must read, so when I needed a new book, I decided \\"why not\\".<br />Though I blushed through almost the entire trilogy, I was captivated.  EL James has a knack for cliffhangers and an easily readable style. The story is so much more than a lust story. I became entwined with the characters in a way I hadn't since Great Expectations... A word of advice, don't begin reading until you have some time to spare. All other things will become secondary to this trilogy until finished.
031618201X|4.0|I'm not wedded to the novel \\"Soulless\\" and since the writer of the Parasol Protectorate is involved with the manga adaptation, I'm even less of a stickler of what may or may not be missing from the manga adaptation of the first book of the series.<br /><br />To me, the best parts of the novel are in the manga adaptation which condenses the storyline of Alexia and Lord Maccon, head of the B.U.R. and alpha werewolf. Alexia is an independent minded spinster of 26 and a rare preternatural. At a ball, she is accosted by a 'rove' which is a vampire that doesn't belong to a hive. Being the resourceful gal that she is, she kills the rove and from there, the reader learns that even the queen bee of London's vampires is uncertain of the situation, loner werewolves are being killed off and there is a waxman who seems to be attacking her (and failing).<br /><br />In the meantime, Alexia and Lord Maccon are sparking around each other while trying to solve the case of the roves, loners and waxman. Also, Lord Akeldama is the perfect sparkly vampire ever created.<br /><br />It is a lot of fun although I do admit that it might be a confusing at the start. Once it hits a rhythm, I think it falls together to the point that someone unfamiliar with the book can figure out the plot as the dialogue is witty and the pace is fast.<br /><br />The art is wonderful. REM keeps the character drawings sexy and crisp and the backgrounds unfussy so as not to distract that the key players are the characters.<br /><br />I enjoyed this adaptation. It is saucy mix of good humor and adventure and it is pretty sexy too.

B007CKNX28|5.0|I listened to this album twice today since it was delivered by UPS this morning. I had to listen to it a second time because I guess I couldn't believe what I had heard the first time around. I would classify this as a classic, up there with Revolver and Exile on Main Street. This is the best new release I've heard in decades. I had never even heard of this guy until three days ago when the owner of my local hi fi shop told me about it, so I came home and ordered it. It's just absolutely amazing from beginning until end. Jack White is an amazing talent. I hope he can keep this up. I honestly don't know if this could ever be trumped. It's that good.
B004LWZW42|4.0|I was disappointed in all of the original X-Men movies.  Though they had some strong actors (Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Hugh Jackman) the movies didn't render strong performances or dialog.  Nor did they come across very deep which is odd since the premise of the X-men stories/comics is extraordinarily psychologically deep.  Someone took charge of X-Men First Class and made it into what the other movies should have been...  stronger acting (mostly by Kevin Bacon, James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender) and better dialog made X-Men First Class stand out as did the emotional depth of a  few of the characters (the poignancy of the Magneto character was really very moving).<br /><br />Though it's still not as good as the newer Batman movies with Christian Bale (The Dark Knight was fantastic - a 5 star movie easily), it deserves a look, praise and 4.5 stars!<br /><br />p.s. Hugh Jackman's cameo, albeit brief, will have you in stitches.
B002GIBVV6|5.0|Not a hollow kiddie flick. Emotionally riveting, with great performances and glorious English scenery. Linda Ronstadt's haunting closing song, \\"Winter Light\\", still leaves me in tears for some unknown reason. It's one of the best  she ever did.

B000O8OTNC|5.0|This tool is a must have. It works great and you can take it anywhere. It sharpens my knives quickly and safely.
034580404X|5.0|This trilogy was awsome.I had not listened to or read any reviews about Fifty Shades prior to buying them. Once I started reading the books I was not able to put them down!!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|this game is awesome has lots.of upgradee characters and everthing its great hope you enjoy asnmufh as i do. bottom line its greatshare it with your freinds.
B003Y5H5HY|5.0|This movie is awesome. A must get on blue-ray. I can't wait till the rest of this series comes out.
B0088W8PLS|1.0|I give the actors, makeup, & effects 5 stars.  The writers get a zero !!!  Just another completely implausible scenario.  Science fiction is one thing, unbelievable fantasy is another.  The back to life and transformation cards are played way to often in Atlantis, probably why it died on the vine.  Every episode was the same old blah, blah, blah.....
B00884GR0W|5.0|i dont play minecraft but my friend does..yes, minecraft might be better but thats for pc and this is an  app! i love it myself. i had i little trouble downloading but after that its was awesome
B002PJ4I3Y|5.0|This book is a great story of WWII and what a group of men went through before during and after and what it takes to get through war. I highly recommend it. A great read.
B001I207M0|1.0|Seriously, how insane is that !!  Obviously the writers have never encountered a four year old.  Stupid, stupid, stupid !!!!  The actors, once again did their job, this series failed because of lousy writing and poor direction.  I have to believe this failure is driven by someone at Sci-Fi, because I see it repeated in all of the Sci-Fi programs.....
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is great!  Love the fast pace.  Really keeps you on your toes.  I bought it ofr my children, but I love to play it just as much.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Author descriptions were elementary, \\"control freak\\" \\"peeked at\\" reading the repetition of phrases and adjectives was painful. I think Anastasia was modeled after Bella in the Twilight series, clumsy, homely, and not well spoken. Waste of money. Someone I know said,\\"Only a non reader would like this book.\\"  I agree.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|id give it a 5 if it didnt freeze my kindle from time to time. other than that my kids love it
B0086700CM|5.0|very awesome and addicting game!! I feel like I am playing it hours on end. very herd to put down and do something else.
034580404X|4.0|Enjoyed reading this triology of shades of grey, had a hard time putting them down. The second and third book being the best, the first one sets you up for what will follow. The books came quickly and were in perfect condition the cardboard casing around the books had some creasing in the corners I assumed from being shipped and needed more care in the packing. I will pass this series along to my friends and relatives for them to enjoy as well.  Thanks Emily Reeves
0763644765|5.0|My 15 month old daughter absolutely LOVES this book! She brings it to me several times a day to be read to, or she sits and flips through it on her own looking at the bright expressive pictures. Ever since she was very small I would often tell her that mommy uses the potty, not diapers, and now she definitely understands the words diaper and potty, and what it means to go \\"tinkle\\", as they say in the book. There's no pressure to potty train, she's still pretty young, but we just like introducing the idea to her. The other day right after she woke up she quickly brought the book to my husband and turned to the page \\"I really have to go!\\" so he took her to the bathroom and put her on the toilet and sure enough she went!! :)<br /><br />One of the things I like about this book is that there isn't a lot of text, so you can kind of make your own story as you look at the pictures (and of course since the baby is gender neutral you can use it for a boy or a girl). One of the reviews says they don't like how the baby keeps getting off the potty, which I kind of agree with...so sometimes I just skip over those pages.<br /><br />All in all, it is a wonderful book to start your toddler out on the road to the undies! :)
B0086700CM|5.0|temple run is my favorite game on my kindle or one of them. I run for fun cuz I bought everything I could:)
B004SHGBDG|1.0|I could get past the fact that it takes all my might, to press through the plastic... but the bottom end of the punch doesn't connect, with the top end, (on one side), so you have to cut the pick out with scizzors.  That defeats the whole purpose of puching out the guitar picks.  The edges come out really rough, as well... they need to be filed down, for a more finished look.<br />Unfortunately, this was a totally disappointment.  I really wanted to make my own picks, effortlessly, out of used up cards.  :(
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|this game is fun when you play it and the seasons on is fun too. I like to play it but its one of those things where I play a different app first
B002IFT1ZA|4.0|You should probably watch this on a weekend and you might also want to cancel all of your appointments because it is very hard to tear yourself away from the tv after you watch the 1st episode.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the box set i received was a bit damaged. The plastic part of the dvd case was cracked, the cardboard parts were bent, and the map was a bit crumpled.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|this game is a fun game that lets you figure out these flow puzzles. complete with lots of levels this game is great
0345803485|1.0|If I could it would be minus 5 stars, it's that bad!<br /><br />Ok, this book is disgusting, that's one word to describe it. I do not like to give a bad review, but man, how immature is this author, it's like some young teen fantasy. Like they did a \\"weird Science\\" move to make their dream man. Come on, at age 26 he is a Billionaire? NO not Millionaire, but Billion! Give me a break, AND he speaks fluent French, fully trained pilot, the best \\"ever\\" pianist, oh yeah, and best lover ever on the planet, (how does she know? She sleep with all on the planet???? Lol) he is drop dead gorgeous, tall, perfectly built with an enormous p****  Not even an erotic book to me, more like fantasy porn. AND how does he make his billions? He never works, spends every second texting or having sex and emailing the female character. Seems the billions have been created with magic.<br /><br />Then you get this horrible writing, you get space filling crap, if you take out all the useless  parts of the female character is blushing, or chewing her lips (what is so great about that?) the book would be short.  I mean there is a whole section devoted to her blushing, and chewing her lips or wondering \\"Jeez\\" about something, how dumb.  Oh, and what's with the getting an orgasms practically every time he even says her name?? Come on! Seems no matter what he does, she orgasms, just dumb and porn like. Seems just about every page has her climaxing.<br />Oh, and not to mention the authors geography. Seems she put it all together like a puzzle of the Pacific Northwest (Hello, I LIVE in the Pacific Northwest, in WA in fact) Seems she took stuff from other popular books that take place here, and put it together WRONG. Like she was drunk when putting it all together.<br /><br />Also what else drove me nuts, it the repeating of so many things, like rolling the eyes (by the way, kindle users, you can do what I did, and type in these useless phrases for search, and you will see lots of the useless dumb repetitions. 41 times roll their eyes. And Ana bites her lips 35 times (not including the chewing of lips, lol) I won't mention them all, as there is so many dumb things said over and over. You get the idea.<br /><br />Like some other reviewers have mentioned, and what depresses me, is that this runaway bestseller and the movie rights are expected to sell for up to $5 Million! That is so crazy, there are so many more talented writers in the genre. And erotica is so much more erotic when an author gets you to care for the characters, were we care what happens to them, then its erotic, and not just immature porn, like this one is. (maybe they will make it a porn, as porn's do not have any plot either?? I am told, as I don't watch that trash either) And I ask, what is romantic about abuse? I just don't get it.<br /><br />The characters come through to me as more schizophrenic than complicated. The romance is more a juvenile dysfunctional crush to me. And as I already said, the erotic scenes are more porn.<br />And to top it all off, THERE IS NO PLOT!!<br /><br />I really have a thing about violence against women and about women that are demoralized, dehumanized and overall abused by men. To me there is nothing fun, or flirty or sexy about the BDSM in this book. This man enjoys inflicting pain on women for his enjoyment, as he states over and over. Just plain disgusting.<br /><br />This man wants to inflict as much pain on this girl as she can tolerate for his pleasure. He stalks and innocent young woman then spends the entire book trying to convince her how great it is to be hurt and humiliates, and how much she will enjoy the experience. I just do not get that. This is not a romantic hero, and he is beyond flawed, he is a monster to me. That this book  is a best seller is something that worries me, do people really enjoy this kind of abuse? Is this something that we should be encouraging people to read? You KNOW impressionable teens will read this, even though it's not aYA book. TOO much hype around it. I am guessing lots of paid publicity, and too many people suckered into buying it. It was loaned to me, I would not pay a penny for this trash.<br /><br />I just can't believe anyone thinks this book is good. Maybe paid reviews are some of them, I do not know. All I know is I read tons of books, and this is the WORST I have read.<br />I do not know what all the hype is about. Just ridiculous! Save your money, in fact save your time, if you even get the book loaned to you, it's still a waste of time. Poorly written, feels like a few teen girls wrote this.<br /><br />I can't say more, it makes me too mad. But I will say, I am sick of the comparison to Twilight, which was a GREAT book, THIS is TRASH!!!<br />Save your money and time.<br /><br />As stated this book was loaned to me for my honest review.<br /><br />This book is so bad, I am embarrassed that I read it at all, only for review, but still, I don 't think I will even post this review of this trash on my own blog.YA book.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game ia great!!!  The difficulty curve could be a smidge steeper, but it is a great puzzle game to cure the curse of boredom!!
B008GXHOFW|4.0|I like the game but it has bad graphics. But its still worth it. Its fun to play it like on car trips. Or when you have nothing to do.
B008CJ0KI8|5.0|Beautifully written and thoughtful album. It really is poetic in its construction from beginning to end. Everyone should be able to relate to love lost, the have and have nots, and what addiction of all kinds can do to us as people. Stunning creation from Ocean.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This was really a great book... you can easily fall in love with that bad boy Travis... he will always have a place in my heart.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|So i bought myslef this movie for Christmas and it was like i bought it brand new i still hav it till this day and still have had not porblems no scratching or anything! Great buy.
B004GCPJDQ|5.0|So I was hesitant on this purchase because of the bad reviews I read but I took the chance because my Magic Mouse has been getting worse with batteries this year. I have had it since 2009 and for some reason it is using more juice now.<br /><br />I just got the Mobee 2 days ago. I had no issues at all seating the charger into my mouse as many have alluded to. It doesn't fit perfectly, but with 1 firm push it clipped securely in place. I plugged the charger in and placed my mouse on it and got the red light that would blink red then go steady red and sometimes flicker red. I remember reading some reviews about that. Well.. I plugged it into a USB hub. Once I plugged it directly into my iMac light turned green and in a few hours I was using my mouse. I also read some people had to click like mad to get the mouse to connect to the Mac. My mouse would do that anyway so I couldn't blame the Mobee. It actually connected faster than it did when I would swap out the batteries.<br /><br />The thing I love MOST is that I if I walk away form my desk I can put the mouse on the Mobee to charge, I can leave the mouse on all the time and when I take it off the Mobee it doesn't lose the connection with the Mac, so great!<br /><br />So all in all I give this thing 5 starts because I feel it has already saved me a TON of time. Could the charger fit a little better in the mouse, sure, but I don't feel that was worth taling a star off. Packaging was very nice and \\"Apple\\" looking and product hits the mark.

B007L3BMGA|3.0|Thought the first half was fine but then it became a bit same ole same ole.  Got a bit sick of the sex and not much story after awhile.  Still read it all though.
B0042RJWTC|1.0|Every single DVD skips and the collection is completely unable to be watched. This was a total waste of money.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I BOUGHT THIS GAME AND PLAYED IT FOR A LONG TIME!(and then I had to take care of my horses)THEN I CAME HOME AND PLAYED IT TILL BED.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Great time waster. I play this and a couple of their other games and this is the best. I would recommend it to others. There are real money uses but just have patience and time and you won't use any.
B00371QQ8Y|1.0|States that will play on DVD, BLU-RAY & PS3!!<br />Does not fit in ps3 slim had to void ps3 warranty to remove disc does not fit in my Philips DVD player or Sony and Samsung blu-ray players!!!!!
1603427244|5.0|This book is a must have for knitters!  There are many ways to cast on stitches and bind them off at the end of the project.  I learned a lot from reading the different techniques.  Definitely a must have book for knitters.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|YouVersion offers so much more than another way to read the Bible. It offers a plethora of reading plans, topical &amp; time minding, as well as almost any version you might want to study. YouVersion helps you share what you're reading, what you're learning and helpsnyou connect with other followers of The Way. I wholeheartedly endorse YouVersion.
1466401885|5.0|Thought it was a strong amazing story.  Towards the end I think the author milked it and drew it out a bit long.  I mean, wow, I got it.  She likes him, he likes her, they cannot communicate but, over and over and over again got old.  Otherwise, well written and a must have.
B008MEM24S|5.0|love this game love seeing one of my fav. cartoon characters! Perry by far is so much better then where's my water crocodile.  easy for my 7 year old and entertaining to a 32 year old :) .99&cent; is a jargon tor a Disney game!
B008MEM24S|5.0|We all love Perry in our house! You have to help Perry escape in each level using water and digging a path for the water or steam. Hours of fun for the kids and parents.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|needs some improvements and needs more games that you can be more interactive with and have more of a plot to it. its a kid friendly variety of games.
B0073LWEXK|4.0|The puzzles in this game are generally challenging without being overwhelming. The game can be completed in one sitting, however. Also, the ending is rather unimpressive. Still, the graphics are good, performance is smooth, and the season-changing mechanic is a fun twist in a puzzle game.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|flow free is an amazing app! it is a great time burner. i am like addicted to it and play it all the time. i truly reccomend flow free.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|fun. makes time fly. my daughter learns from it and is learning to count :) a game for all ages!
B008JGSM6G|1.0|I don't like it its very very boring to me because all you do is conect the dots that's all<br />boring.
B004LWZW42|5.0|I am not an X Men fan and did not know this movie even was out last year.  I stumbled across it on HBO and watched the end once I saw Kevin Bacon (who I really like) was in it.  I was hooked and had to watch the whole movie.  The young actors are very good.  There was just enough characters to get to know a little about each one and their motives for what happens in the later X Men movies.<br /><br />I plan to purchase this once HBO quits running it.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Love Love Love playing the game with friends and family.  l would like upgrade to the paid for version with the free bombs coins and more words but some reviewers say that it will not apply itself to the free app. I don't want lose what I have to gain what I don't have.
B000OXHRRC|4.0|Delightful story line that is well conceived and written.  Choice for character selection works very well.  Morally and ethically correct.
B00723NWJE|4.0|Been a big Norah Jones fan for years and although she has better albums, this one is definitely worth a listen.

B00899DR40|2.0|This is nothing like the first 2 albums. His vocal talents are masked by over-processing and sampling. Bring back Bieber!
B006RUJST6|5.0|I loved this book! It was refreshing, captivating, and I couldn't let go! I can't wait to read the sequel! A great story with great characters. It made me laugh and cry, I literally could not put it down!
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Very addicting, I have lost hours immersed in this game! I  definitly would recommend it to anyone who enjoys puzzles or logic games.
B00004X10B|5.0|I bought this bag for bringing to events where I needed to carry two cameras and multiples lenses. I had no trouble fitting two camera bodies, a flash, bracket, 4 lenses including my Canon 70-200 L which is huge. That is thanks to the movable velcro dividers. Tons of extra pockets for all other accessories you need, and being a woman, I will admit that included a few beauty products. I have used for only 6 events thus far, so I cannot comment on wear and tear other than it still looks brand new. I have taken it on a plane, and it fit fine in the overhead compartment. Now if I only had my own personal Sherpa...
B007R3B4RG|5.0|What can I say. Joey's last material is finnally out. It's great rock n roll that never fails. Every song has its personality and vibe with good ol' rocanrol hooks. You won't regret I bet as Joey was a true Rock God.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This a great puzzle/thinking game! First time playing something like this. I play every evening. :) I end up losing track of time. I have to .solve them all. I've stopped playing all other games because of it. I hope the developer comes up with more levels. Definitely a must for puzzle lovers!!!!!! Installed on RAZR MAXX.
B008MEM24S|5.0|omg!!!!! this game is tha bomb its more better than were's my water. I love it I'm addicted to this game!!!! :)
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is challenging and hard to complete. I cant wait to unlock all of the games and play them. definately worth the download
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I am amazed at how accurate and fast it is. This is well worth the money, and I highly recommend it.
B00884GR0W|5.0|I bought Minevraft for my laptop, but it wouldn't work. I found this game and bought it, and I noticed not only does it have better graphics, but I could actually PLAY IT! This is my favorite app for kindle fire. I love it.
B0051RP4DA|5.0|I've always thought Eddie Vedder was very spiritual. Pearl Jam's music has always been very emotionally driven music. In this solo project, Vedder takes this same emotional charge and swoons to the tune of a ukelele. It was when I grabbed a free Starbucks itunes download for \\"Longing to Belong\\" that I was hooked. Amazon offered the whole album digitally for 2.99 and I couldn't pass it up.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I really enjoy this on the Kindle Fire. It is a simple concept but it challenges your brain, as well.
B000V63CSU|5.0|\\"The Spaghetti Incident?,\\" is the 5th studio album by rock legends Guns N Roses (aptly referred to as G' N' F' N' R' on the warning sticker). Released in 1994, this would be the last album with the original line-up. It sounds like the far better Use Your Illusion albums (IMO the best Hard Rock albums of all time). The difference is that every single song is a cover of an unknown song like Attitude by The Misfits.<br /><br />(3/5) Since I Don't Have You - This is not a great start. This is a rather dull piano ballad. It sounds like a joke in the opening with the ridiculously bent strings and high-pitched piano. Originally done by the Skyliners. This song kind of reminds me of Chinese Democracy favorite Catcher In The Rye.<br /><br />(4.5/5) New Rose - This would have been a far better start to the album. It is a very fast punk-sounding song. It fits the Guns N' Roses sound perfectly, just like a few others on here. Originally performed by The D**ned. My only real problem is that it feels far too short. But, if the one problem you have with something is that you want more, it's not a bad thing.<br /><br />(3.5/5) Down On The Farm - This song is not great, but not bad either. Axl's voice doesn't sound right at all. It sounds like he's trying to sound English. It's actually pretty irritating at some points and I really wish he had sung it normally. Originally done by the U.K. Subs.<br /><br />(5/5) Human Being - This is one of the highlights of the album. It's the longest song on here at 6:48 (with the far-worse Ain't It Fun in second with 5:06) but it doesn't feel like it's dragging. This actually sounds like something Axl would write, along with a few others on here. His voice is perfect and the riff is amazing. Originally done by the New York Dolls.<br /><br />(5/5) Raw Power - Another highlight of the album! This is a fantastic song that is made even better by Axl's screaming vocals and Slash's/Izzy's wailing guitar.<br /><br />(1/5) Ain't It Fun - Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaandthe album has taken a sharp-nosedive. The only slightly redeeming quality is the riff. Axl is joined by Michael Monroe for this piece, by the singing style is awful. They both strain out their lines and the lyrics are the complete opposite of Guns N' Roses \\"drink and f' and get on the lam\\" signature style. Originally done by the Dead Boys/Rocket From The Tombs (written while he was in RFTT, released when he was in Dead Boys[TWSS].)<br /><br />(3.5/5) Buick Mackane/Big Dumb S*x - This is actually a combination of two different choruses; Buick MacKane and Big Dumb S*x. Only half of this is good. The Buick MacKane bit is pretty boring, but the Big Dumb S*x section is done far better than the original done by Chris Cornell. Interestingly, Big Dumb S*x is supposed to be making fun of hard rock bands like G' N' R'. Originally done by T. Rex and Soundgarden respectively.<br /><br />(5/5) Hair Of The Dog - And the album has been picked up! It's basically smooth sailing from here on out, but Hair Of The Dog is one of the best songs on here. It doesn't sound like a Guns N' Roses song, but they made it work oh so well, just, so beautifully! It brings a tear to my eye /sarcasm! Originally done by Motley Crüe.<br /><br />(5/5) Attitude - This is the shortest song on here and the one that doesn't sound like a Guns N' Roses song in any way. It's a fast British punk song with a profane chorus. Originally done by the Misfits.<br /><br />(5/5) Black Leather - Oh boy. Oh boy oh boy oh boy. This is not only the best song on here, this is one of Guns N' Roses best songs (probably my twelfth favorite.). This sounds so much like a Guns N' Roses song that I was actually surprised to learn that this wasn't original. Everything about this is perfect, from the singing style to the riff to the lyrics, everything is right with this. If you only get one song from this album, buy THIS. Originally done by The Professionals.<br /><br />(3/5) You Can't Put Your Arms Around A Memory - Nah, not veryinteresting. It's a slow piano ballad with Duff McKagan on vocals. Originally done by Johnny Thunders.<br /><br />(3.5/5) I Don't Care About You - Um, what did I just hear? No, seriously, this song moves way too fast to be understandable. I mean, G' N' R' has done fast songs like Garden Of Eden, but his voice is really weird on this recording. Originally done by Fear.<br /><br />(4.5/5) Look At You're Game Girl - This is a hidden track that comes after a short silence. Now, I'll just get this out of the way - Yes, this song was written by CHARLES MANSON. AKA, that guy who used his family to kill people. Now, this is a great song, but it just feels disturbing to hear a song written by a sociopath.<br /><br />This is a fantastic album, and I would recommend getting this after Use Your Illusion I/II and Appetite For Destruction.

B004LWZWGK|4.0|One question remains after viewing the last epic installment of Christopher Nolan's `Dark Knight Trilogy,' `The Dark Knight Rises,' \\"What more could we expect?\\"  Surely the final chapter is as much a visual masterpiece as its predecessors.  The action scenes are ample; the wide angle chases still fill one with vertigo; and in every way the special effects are stunning.  Expect plenty of Oscar nominations (and some wins) for `The Dark Knight Rises' for its technical achievements.<br /><br />There's no lack of acting ability in the film, either.  Besides old staples like Christian Bale (Batman), Michael Caine (Alfred), Morgan Freeman (Lucius Fox) and Gary Oldman (Commissioner Gordon), there are fresh characters fully fleshed out, especially  Detective Burke, a Harvey Dent successor (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a Bruce Wayne laisson (Marion Cotillard) a chief, new super enemy in Bane (Tom Hardy), and Batman's new frenemy in crime, Cat Woman (Anne Hathaway) stand out especially.  (Note that Gordon-Levitt, Murphy, Hardy, and Cotillard join the talent pool as alumni from `Inception.')<br /><br />The plot is not simple, but most of the movie surely reflects the themes with a post 9-11, Great Recession resonance.  Newly minted misfit Bane takes over Gotham City--first with a stock exchange takeover and later with a planted neutron bomb.  He looks like a WWF character with a muzzle, and sounds and talks like a second cousin to Darth Vader.  (He even has some dialogue with Batman more than reminiscent of the former trilogy.)  In the background is Bruce Wayne/Batman convalescing over the bruises to his image as well as to his body.  There are many side-plots that crossover, but much of the movie spends time--almost too much--revealing the background, the identity, and the motivations of Bane and several other criminals who have brought new chaos to Gotham.  In the midst of pandemonium, is a vigilante group of law enforcers (or wreckers), including a rogue court held by a self-appointed judge (Cillian Murphy).  One of the movie's problems is it goes from exposition, action, to exposition, action until we get exposition past the first half of the movie, and the movie is not short by any measure.<br /><br />As a roller-coaster entertainment `The Dark Knight Rises' wins.  It takes the threads of `The Dark Knight' and neatly picks up where it left off.  The points made, the resolution brought does bring closure in a satisfying way.  It keeps to the premise that to build suspense the central hero has to be on the ropes for as long as possible.  The biggest drawback to the finale' is that it takes on too much.  Surely chaos in the real world is complicated--one with many subplots and strings attached--but in a movie, the story needs to be told in a simpler way.  (The first two movies had several plot points, but they were more finely honed.)  While `Batman Begins' hit the refresh button on the franchise, and `The Dark Knight' took comic book movies to heights unseen before or since, the final installment sometimes bites off much more than it can chew.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|the best game in the entire world. I love this game so much I just wish that you did not have to buy more glu credits.
B008M87GJK|5.0|BBC app is great. Each news story is displayed with a picture and a title. You are also able to to customize what sort of news you want/or not want to receive in the options menu. Swiping is used to switch news stories, very easy!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I had heard a lot about this book, and was looking forward to reading it on my vacation.  I downloaded it on my Kindle for the trip.  I was very disappointed in this book and didn't even finish reading it, because it was so poorly written.  The characters didn't ring true, and the plot dragged.  It read as if it were written by a teenager.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I can play this game for hours!! It gives me a nice challenge and there are enough levels and difficultly levels to keep everyone happy.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Storyline moved very slowly and was too predictable.  Characters weren't interesting.  Not at all comparable to the Twilight series, as had been eluded to on the reviews.  There were so many spins it could have taken.  Disappointing.
B008F5YDRI|4.0|Enjoyed this movie a lot. It's different, a little quirky, and has a heartwarming story. Scenery was gorgeous. British humor was hilarious. Comic timing was excellent. Salmon were healthy and jumpy.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is a fun game. no violence involved. not very often found. keep up the good work. I would love to see a second part of it.

0307888681|1.0|I was very disappointed in this book. I am apart of a book club and this book we all voted for to read for the month. The whole book club could not get into it and all had dropped reading it. Once we started talking about how the book is coming along all had stated they could not get into it at all..and did not want to read it.I do know that there probably are some people who do like this type of book and that is fine. Just know that this book is not for everyone. And not everything is as it seems when it comes to what they say this book is about vrs reading it.
0345803485|1.0|My curiosity got the best of me and I wanted to see what the fuss was all about. I read a lot but had never felt compelled to post a review...until now. Fifty Shades of Grey is the most poorly-written book I've ever read. There is no plot, the characters are shallow and inconsistent, and don't even get me started on the repetitions. How does a 50-year-old mother of two write like a pre-teen who's never had an orgasm and still believes in fairy tales? And this monstrosity drags on into a freaking TRILOGY??? I should get a medal for finishing this by sheer will alone.<br /><br />Ana acts like a 12-year-old and her over-the-top innocence is just annoying. What's all that \\"subconscious\\" and \\"inner goddess\\" crap? Stop saying \\"oh my\\" and stop biting your lip!!! And the fact that she's instantaneously ready and has mind-blowing orgasms EVERY TIME must make those women who struggle to climax insanely jealous.<br /><br />Christian Grey is many things. Stalker. Possessive control freak. Pedophile (Ana's mental age!). Jekyll and Hyde. Psycho a trigger away from turning into a serial killer (the \\"Red Room of Pain\\" reminds me too much of Martin Vanger's torture chamber). There's rough sex, there's BDSM, then there's abuse. What he does borders on abuse (the tampon scene will scar me for life, and I'm not easily repulsed).<br /><br />Nothing really makes any sense, though I did get some laughs from the ridiculousness of the whole story so I guess not all is lost. Reading the many ingenious reviews on Amazon was definitely far more enjoyable.

B003Y5H4Y8|4.0|I saw this movie yesterday here in Brasil. I saw it in Blu-ray, DVD is dead for me!!! Why the industry STILL releases DVDs???<br />Well, The PQ an the AQ are very good! The movie is dense, tense, great actors, great plot. One of the best movies I've seen this year! Don't miss it!
B0073U2FB2|4.0|The Darkest Hour was a good movie.  The special effects were awesome.  I watched the movie straight thru without taking any breaks.  The ending could have been different.  I think the producers thought maybe they would leave it open so they can make a second movie.  However, it was still enjoyable.
B007WCJSWA|5.0|I am a huge fan of Mike Stern, have all his cds, and have seen him live many times.<br /><br />On this cd, he has outdone himself, going one step beyond Who Let the Cats Out?<br />Great songwriting is the strong feature of the recording and despite the variety of styles of tunes written, the whole album fits together beautifully. Mike's usual great soloing is on the cd, but the solos are short and sometimes it is hard to tell where the songwriting ends and where the solo begins. And that's a good thing.<br /><br />Rather than using one band for the whole recording, Mr. Stern uses different musicians on each track. There is a long list of top-rate players. Three tracks feature the rhythm section of Dave Holland and Al Foster and it is wonderful to hear this fantastic jazz bassist and drummer interact with Mike. Other tracks feature Stern's usual cohorts and other top fusion players.<br /><br />The list of bass players is a who's-who of great players and one of them, Victor Wooten, turns in an outstanding performance. His solo on Half Way Home is beautiful and highly musical, not his usual slap display, but of course it shows his incredible technique which serves his musical statement perfectly.<br /><br />Run and get the cd.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is so captivating and enticing!!! You won't be able to put it down and you'll never look at relationships and love the same way!

B00002SSKI|5.0|Great price. Got it in a short amount of time. Love this type of movie. I have this movie on VHS but needed it on a DVD.
B004LWZWGK|3.0|Yes, the movie was good, but it wasn't great. It was about on the same level of Batman Begins, but that was already done. Then there was the Dark Knight, which was a step up from Batman Begins. This final film is then a step down. An \\"ending\\" should always be a step above the last. So, the movie kind of disappoints. Perhaps it was because I watched the whole trilogy at once, or that it was late and I was kind of tired and hungry, but I'm not surprised. Christopher Nolan himself has said the problem with movie franchises is that the first films are almost always better. In this case, the second one is the best.<br />SPOILERS AHEAD<br />I'm just going to jump right into it. How can this be an end when that would totally contradict the first movie? Batman isn't a man. He's a symbol, an ideal, not flesh and blood. Men can die. Men will die. But Batman will always live on as a beacon of hope for the oppressed and a nightmare of fear for those without decency. And the actual ending to this final film? Yes, Bruce Wayne \\"dies\\", but so does Selina Kyle as she obviously wiped her record clean or even from existence. So, legally, they're dead, or at least one is and the other no longer exists, but physically speaking, they're alive and well and seem to be together romantically. Batman's not dead as Robin John Blake (his full name) has inherited the batcave and will obviously assume the mantle, even though he hasn't been as highly trained like Bruce. So, right there, you can already make a fourth Batman film and even a spinoff 'Midnight in Florence' romantic film about two lovers, no past, many secrets, questionable source of income, and much more. As for Bane, he truly is a student of Ras Al Ghul as in I felt like I just watched a longer version of Batman Begins. I mean, statistically, he should be the scariest foe of all the movies as he killed the highest number of innocent people and destroyed the most property, but he never came off as menacing as the Joker. And it was hard to understand what he said sometimes with his Darth Vader meets Sean Connery voice. And how could Bruce Wayne not figure out he had Talia Al Ghul in his presence? It's supposed to be realistic. Am I supposed to believe Bruce Wayne doesn't do background checks on his business associates? And he also slept with her. He only kissed Rachel and he technically stalked her in the first two movies. He found out everything he could about Selina Kyle before kissing her. But if he sleeps with a woman, he wont even google her? That's just nonsensical. The movie was disappointing. I figured the whole thing out before the 40 minute mark. The Dark Knight was way better. That movie blew me away. The only things that surprised me in this movie was that Alfred left Bruce Wayne which, to me, came out of nowhere, Wayne Enterprises was bankrupt (before Bane even showed up), and that someone would actually name their son Robin. I see why John Blake never said that name once throughout the whole movie. I guess I should review Anne Hathaway's performance as Selina Kyle/Catwoman. Not going to lie, better than I thought it would be, but still forgettable. She did well as Selina Kyle, but her Catwoman wasn't very good. It just didn't seem natural. I could buy her girl next door turned femme fatale, but the tights just seemed too far for her acting range. That reminds me, Bane's death sucked too. He should've died in an explosion, preferably with the Wayne tech built device threatening the city like Ras Al Ghul before him. That gives me an idea for a better ending. Tragic, but better. I'll keep that to myself for now. Enough spoilers for one day.

B005F9TPZ2|5.0|I fell in love with Fiona Apple the first time I heard her in concert in 1997, just after Sleep to Dream came out (and possibly Criminal; time gets fuzzy 15 years ago). I went out and bought Tidal the next day. I was a little late to the party in picking up this one and Extraordinary Machine, but clearly I'm an easy sell on her works, and Tidal was going to be hard to follow. Miss Fiona does not disappoint. I routinely put it into my car's CD player and let it cycle over and over. There's a different sound to this one, while sounding just like her. I hesitate to say a maturity, but perhaps a degree of control. Even my less favored songs have a rare depth and beauty and they touch my heart in spite of themselves. Looking forward to hearing her latest.
B00846REIS|2.0|WARNING: SPOILER ALERTS:<br />BARED TO YOU for me was in the least disappointing, at most verging on psychopathic. Gideon is excruciatingly bi-polar and Eva is your stereotypical insecure girl. The entire time I was reading I was thinking to myself, \\"wait, I thought he told her he doesn't do romance\\" and right from the beginning (in between all the over the top, multiple orgasm, wannabe hardcore sex) he was buying her a ring, giving her 3 dresser drawers at his house and flouting about how he can't live without her. He's known her all of 48 hours and talked to her maybe twice before shes humping him in the limo and expressing their mutual \\"need\\" for each other. By the end all I could think about is, \\"Yes, we get it... he is the most beautiful man alive and his member is almost too large for her perfect petite frame to handle\\" The author tried to slip in some of the ever-popular BDSM but it was lacking and didn't really become relevant. I did like exploring Eva's past and how she and Carey are coping with the abuse they suffered. But not enough for me to pay for the next installment.
B001MS7IBS|2.0|Impressive? Yes.<br />Intelligent? No, not at all. This is stupid... OK, smart but stupid.<br /><br />Sure, the characters are sympathetic, but oh so shallow. Their motivations are totally unclear, and as a result, their actions do appear impulsive.<br />The story arc? Aw, come on! A SF series is only as believable as is the basic (college level) science. And that is not the case here. Quite a number of basic scientific facts are plainly wrong. And since they are stated by Dr Bishop (a genius with a 190 IQ), this really hinders my acceptance of the fringe science. Also, fringe science should remains credible, which is sometimes hard... E.g. a gigantic wormlike virus? You don't say! A virus is an RNA string, it has no \\"flesh\\"... How bogus can it get? This is like 50s SF of the worst kind (such as gigantic amoebae...).<br />The pilot is probably the worst episode of all: how come Olivia gets what she needs, however far-fetched, without opposition, and sometimes even without asking? She gets Bishop out of a high-security mental hospital cum prison, after 17 years, just like that? And her assistant, junior Astrid, is never astonished by what goes on in Bishop's lab?<br />Typical Abrams stuff, though: a lot of diverted subplot, often reduced to mere hints, some of which become mainline, others to dwindle and vanish ... Add some menacing stuff, especially towards Olivia, it always works. Sure, that formula keeps the tension going, but it is no more than an empty shell!<br />And what about Peter Bishop? Present but virtually absent... Broyle? Present, but what for? He could be part of the furniture, it would make no difference.<br />Really, I've made an effort to get through season 1, but that's it for me. No more Fringe!

B004UNNAIM|2.0|Yes, the book was well written, but I had trouble seeing the character development.<br /><br />I get that Meursault is supposed to be emotionally detached from his environment. That much is clear.<br /><br />But, when one reads a novel, you expect the events in the novel to bring about some sort of change in the character. You expect the protagonist, at the very least, to be changed, for better or worse, after living through certain events in the novel.<br /><br />Here we have Meursault attending his own mother's funeral, a woman who has declared her love for him, and a murder that he committed, and none of it seems to have had any major impact on his way of thinking.<br /><br />For me this made this sparse novel a bit of a \\"why bother\\" read. Why do I need an entire novel, some 124 pages, to tell me that someone was completely unaffected by a few events? I find it a waste of time.<br /><br />And let's take this discussion one step further. If this is a novel about Meursault, who is not effected by the events that take place in the novel, then why even have Meursault in the novel at all?<br /><br />Glad I read the book. Now I've confirmed for myself that the hype was just that, hype.

1400023343|4.0|This is an interesting book that's worthwhile reading about the concept of raising bilingual children. It discusses statistics of reading and verbal abilities among bilingual and monolingual children, major strategies for raising a bilingual child (one-parent-one-language, major-language-at-home, etc.), and other subjects. However, practical advice is limited.<br /><br />There are at least two errors in this book, although they're minor points. First, the author claims in two different passages that a French \\"p\\" is pronounced like an English \\"b\\". I'm a native speaker of French, and this assertion is simply wrong. Second, the author claims that the existence of multiple languages is critical to the survival of our species. That's factually incorrect: if we all spoke the same language, we'd still manage to reproduce.
B004LWZWGA|2.0|DARK KNIGHT RISES REVIEW<br /><br />This is a good but severely flawed movie and despite all of the negatives I am going to point out, this movie is definitely worth a rental or cable watch and nothing else.<br /><br />SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!<br /><br />The first major problem with this movie takes place within the first 45-60 mins.  For the first hour of the movie, the film is just all over the place introducing, reintroducing, and focusing on characters that didn't need to be in the movie (Matthew Modine I'm looking at you).  Even though I feel like some scenes and lines with Catwoman (and her friend) were not needed and they took away from Batman's story, I was able to slightly accept her character sucking away screen time from the main character, Bruce Wayne/Batman.  What I wasn't able to accept was how much screen time and lines the other \\"nonessential\\" characters took away from Wayne.<br /><br />Everyone from Joseph Gordon Levitt's character, to Gary Oldman's character, to Matthew Modine's character, all consumed way too much screen time and lines even when Wayne is on screen with them.  There is this one scene where Levitt's character is talking to Wayne about how he met Wayne when he was younger that not only takes up way too much time, but also makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.  Scenes like this are scattered all throughout the first hour of the movie and these scenes take away from what was really interesting which was Bruce Wayne's depression and Alfred's desperate attempt to kick him out of it.  Bruce Wayne's sorrow is so ignored within that first hour that when he eventually decides to start \\"rising\\" from his slump that you feel like it was rushed.<br /><br />I feel like this movie is perfect for those suffering from schizophrenia because it is all over the place, especially in the first hour, which then takes away from scenes with Batman that should have been more drawn out, so that you can feel a sense of triumph or relief when Wayne/Batman eventuallyovercomes everything that is being forced upon him.  Scenes with Wayne/Batman are consistently cut short in this movie to focus on characters that should never have had so many lines and some of these characters shouldn't have even been in the movie.<br /><br />To get a better understanding of this huge flaw simply think back to the much better previous movies Batman Begins and The Dark Knight.  In Batman Begins Wayne/Batman was the main character and all of the other characters revolved around him and his story line.  In the Dark Knight, Wayne/Batman was one of two main characters, but every other character's story or plotline either revolved around Wayne/Batman, or how Wayne/Batman could come to love, fight, or work with these other characters within his world.  In this movie, The Dark Knight Rises, you get this feeling that every character exists on completely separate plains from each other, minus the Wayne/Alfred relationship, and when these characters do eventually interact with one another, it feels slightly jarring, awkward, and out of place.  Kind of like watching two people on a first date where neither one have anything in common with each other.<br /><br />The next major problem with this movie involves the main bad guy (Bane) and his motives.  As a comic book fan in my youth, who enjoyed the Bane story both in the comics and even in the animated cartoon from the 90's, I somehow was able to get myself to accept this Mini-Me version of Bane in this movie.  I even liked Bane's voice in this film, and Tom Hardy's interpretation of the character.<br /><br />The problem with Bane in this movie was his completely unoriginal motives.  Bane basically wants to destroy Gotham City simply because The League of Shadows wanted to.  Bane is metaphorically speaking, a younger, stronger, reincarnated version of Raz Al Ghul from the first Batman Begins movie, hell-bent on destroying Gotham City.  And like Raz Al Ghul from Batman Begins, Bane steals a very high tech weapon/bomb from Wayne Enterprises in order to crush Gotham altogether.  At one point in the movie, Bane even verbally announces that his motives are basically Raz Al Ghul's motives, which means, the screenwriters were completely aware that they were regurgitating an old idea.  I really don't know what is worse, the screenwriters consciously recognizing they are essentially creating the same \\"bad guy\\" in a different movie, or them subconsciously not realizing they are!?<br /><br />What makes Bane's plan absolutely nonsensical is the fact that midway through the movie Bane is able to steal the nuclear bomb that will destroy all of Gotham.  Instead though of detonating this bomb once he obtained it, Bane decided to wait a very long period of time just holding on to it while Wayne/Batman was recouping outside of Gotham.  Keep in mind, this movie convinces the viewers that Bane's plan was to destroy Gotham all along, and if that was Bane's plan all along then why did he not detonate the bomb the second he got his hands on it?  Why was detonating the bomb so important and dire when Batman came back to Gotham, but before hand, Bane and his secret partner were very nonchalantly just sitting on a bomb they were going to blow up anyway?<br /><br />The same writers from the previous Bat films seriously dropped the ball on this one and made the same huge mistake the Spider-Man 3 writers made, by regurgitating ideas from the first film and also by focusing on way too many character plotlines and the feelings and thoughts they possess.  The director and the editing crew also dropped the ball.  Due to their thoughtless approach to this supposed epic finale, The Dark Knight Rises falters on so many occasions that it becomes very hard for me to recommend this movie to anyone even though I was a huge fan of the previous films.  I still recommend a rental for those that want to see how this series ends, but keep in mind, when you watch it, I just briefly touched on some of the flaws withthe movie, not all of the flaws, and I can keep going for double the length of this review... Yes, there are that many problems with this movie.

It's one of those albums that you can listen to 24/7 and not get tired!

B0060AY85C|5.0|This novel, Home,is mainly about Frank Money and his sister, Cee and their family. The brother and sister love one another deeply. However, the love between a brother and sister can't protect neither one from the sharpness of emotional pain. While Frank fights on the war front in Korea, Cee is home in Lotus, Georgia fighting poverty and discrimination during 1938. Toni Morrison's novel helped me see better the underside of war. Still, there is no way, I believe, to fully understand a veteran's battle without fighting in a war like these men and in our time women.  It hurts to lose one friend to death. How must it feel to lose three close friends? I think the pain would be unimaginable. War brings out the worse in the best of men. This is one of the secrets from the war so disturbing to Frank's mind.<br /><br />Then, there is the pain only truly understood by another woman. When a woman wants a child and finds out this is not possible for whatever reason life becomes deeply painful like a deep scratch without a scab. Children are all around her. Where can she hide from what her heart so desires? Cee fights with the fact daily that she can't bare a baby. Cee begins to see the faces of children wherever she goes or while she is looking at whatever she looked at around her.<br /><br />\\"You know that toothless smile babies have?\\" she said. \\"I keep seeing it. I saw it in a green pepper once. Another time a cloud curled in such a way it looked like....\\"<br /><br />Ultimately, the novel confirms that life is possible after the worst of circumstances comes my way. The spirit is indomitable it seems.<br /><br />\\"The sun, having sucked away the blue from the sky, loitered there in a white heaven, menacing Lotus, torturing its landscape, but failing, failing, constantly failing to silence it: children still laughed, ran, shouted...\\"
B008FC4WA4|4.0|What made me buy this one was the name of the story and the cover page. The name does not make sense at all and it compelled me find out more about the story.

Its more of a slice of life story without a well defined start and ending, however the premise is very interesting. Its about a man whose ex-wife starts writing about him in a weekly column called \\"Bastard\\" (that explains the name - Everyone's reading bastard). Its all about the trials and tribulations of this man as each week some of his most embarrassing secrets become public fodder.

B008JH5CVS|5.0|It had some great dialog. Very funny to break up the action. Renegade CIA agent (Guy Pearce) was sexy and the reluctant hero. The President's daughter (Maggie Grace) was a strong female character.
B0067EKY7M|1.0|Romance Negatives:<br />(1.) Acting was method, read-the-script unemotional, cutout characterizations. Just stand there and look pretty, not-so-challenging acting. I have seen more natural believable performances from then 9/10 year old actresses Morgana Davies & Garance Le Guillermic.<br />(2.) Formula script of love triangle (two good looking guys chasing one female) so we now know the target audience.<br />(3.) Ethically, a corrupt script. A girl falls into life long love with a soldier who suddenly has to go to Afghanistan. Supposedly a heartfelt and forever love which should survive the dangers that the soldier faces. Subsequently, he goes missing and even possibly killed. His girl's commitment suddenly has a change of heart. She starts falling for her co-worker who happens to be married. His marriage is a bit bland and it's mostly his fault. His solution is to fall in love with the aforementioned more attractive co-worker. The soldier survives and comes back to his love except she is now attracted to that co-worker cheating husband; the one who dissed his wife. Values? Soldier gets dumped while performing his dangerous military duty and cold husband dumps wife for something more attractive.<br /><br />History Negatives:<br />(1.) Movies that pretend to have a real world backdrop should be, at the least, 50% accurate so that the audience has spent some time being more rather than less educated.<br />(2.) Yemen has had a conflict ridden democracy with a President and VP for decades. A Prince would be more accurate for Saudi Arabia - not Yemen. The British, as usual, messed things up in the Middle East after WWII with how they allocated lands and entitlements which is one reason why the area is in constant conflict.  Al-Qaeda and others now take advantage of that and made it into a safe haven war zone. The writer & director have minimized the wealth and religious disparities in that country by scripting a Prince with an ostentatious display of his wealth e.g. using it for a personal fishing stream (irrigation rationale for that geography fails miserably) is irresponsible greed. I wouldn't be surprised if this movie doesn't become a great propaganda tool for Al-Qaeda.<br />(3.) The movie also makes comedic the Yemeni shortage of water. In reality, brief episodes of heavy rain and subsequent ravine flooding makes agriculture there very difficult. This movie's solution is to use aquifer water to sustain the Princes' fishing river year round. A script from out-of-touch writers which makes wasteful misuse of scarce aquifer water a stupid idea and is demeaning to the Yemeni. In this country people are dying because of a lack of water.<br />(4.) The political killings over the decades in Yemen are made movie-comical with an incompetent single assassin who is foiled by our British fish expert by casting a fishing line at him. This was followed by a second assassination attempt created as a not believable river flooding scene meant to drown the Prince; yet again saved by our British fish expert.<br />(5.) It was filmed mostly in Morocco - wonder why. They didn't even bother to show the real Yemen and it's people? Well, they did bother to show fish. Serious out-of-touch writing in showing our British female character inappropriately dressed/behavior as an affront to Islam.<br />(6.) Since salmon occupied such a big part of the movie it would have been more realistic to get Portuguese, Chilean, Californian salmon or better still steelhead.<br /><br />Only Positive:<br />Restaurant scene juxtaposing spaghetti with the tangled iPod earbud cord. How true!

B0053YEM7U|5.0|I've been a Yes fan for quite some time now and was rather reluctant to purchase this Cd of 2010 Yes. Watching some of the new videos on Youtube with lead singer David Benoit did not impress me at all. I was torn between this record or the Jon Anderson/Rick Wakeman cd that was also out. I was reluctant on both counts.<br /><br />But, as memory told me, I was a big fan of the 1980 Yes record 'Drama' which featured Trevor Horn on vocals and Geoff Downes on keyboard. A very uptemple album back then, but not really a YES album by a long shot. Or was it? All depends on ones viewpoint. Yes has had a rotating door on band members since the third album, and they continue to add or subtract members. 'Fly From Here' was co-written and produced by Trevor Horn, and the album has some of the feel of the Drama record. BUT, there is a lot of primitive YES sound here as well. Steve Howe continues to impress me as a great innovative guitarist (co-writer of many Yes classics), and Chris Squire plays some mean base lines on this one (as in early Yes). Alan White backs it all up with some great drumming. Remember, Alan came on board during the 'Close To the Edge' concerts and played in the musical epic 'Tales of Topographic Oceans' after Bill Bruford left the band.<br /><br />So when Jon Anderson and Rick Wakeman left the band due to health issues a few years ago, the band decided to move onward. Of course, Anderson is well now but still was not included in this latest creation. 'Fly From Here' is a great vehicle for Benoit as the new lead singer. Now, even though Benoit sounds a little like Anderson, he does not have half the singing potential, nor writing potential, of Anderson. Anderson is the heart and soul of Yes, and without him they are just another band - no matter how great they are together. So, Benoit singing classic Yes material is fine, but he lacks a certain quality that can only come from his predisor. With these new songs (some going back to 1980) he is able to be his own self and mark his own territory.<br /><br />But 'Fly From Here' is nowhere close to a classic Yes album with Jon at the wheel. It is a great album, with great songs, and great musicianship (as are all Yes albums), but the heart was missing. Now the title song 'Fly From Here' is an epic song of over 20 minutes broken down into smaller segments. It feels good. And it sounds good. But you have to remember, most of the Yes membership are up in their sixties or seventies. They are not spring chickens. Yet here they are playing quality music that blows some of the newer bands out of the water.<br /><br />The six part lead song is followed by five other songs that all stand on their own. Squires 'The Man You always Wanted Me To Be' is actually pretty good. It is a great bridge from Fly From Here to the other songs on the musical plate. 'Life On the Set', 'Hour Of Need', Solitaire (Howe), and 'Into the Storm' are all wonderful songs and show us the great potential that Benoit brings to the band.<br /><br />It is fair to compare this recording with Drama, since neither features Anderson or Wakeman. Not fair to compare it with Anderson lead albums of the past. But Anderson and Wakeman are still alive and playing music. So who knows what the future will bring. If Anderson has slowed the band down, maybe it is time to go a different route. But Yes without Anderson will never be the same band. That is a given.<br /><br />I give this record five stars because it is a great effort from one of my favorite all time bands who always seem to have one more card up their sleeves.

B007URVZJ6|4.0|This book was very helpful when I set up my first book for kindle.....very informative, but left some things out. That's why only four stars.
B0067JMJ8E|5.0|Well, what can I say about a band that has been together, in one form or another, since 1969? At first I was very reluctant to buy this Cd simply because I was not sure of the new lead singer David Benoit. I had seen his stuff on Youtube and was less then impressed. So, YES without Jon Anderson on vocals? It had been done before, back in 1980. But it led to the bands eventual breakup. Due to that Asia and later GTR was formed by Steve Howe. YES' last studio album was Magnification and that was done many many years ago. Because of Andersons recent illness he could not perform for over a year and the band was more then restless. Thus, a new lead singer.<br /><br />I would not have purchased this Cd if not for four of the songs on the song list: Tempus Fugit (Drama), Astral Travelor (from Time and A Word), Machine Messiah (Drama), and South Side of the Sky (Fragile). The group was already doing South Side with Anderson before he took ill, but this is always a great song to hear live. The rest of the lineup can be heard on almost any other live YES album out there.<br /><br />So, how does this version of YES stack up with previous incarnations? I would have to say - NOT BAD. I was amazingly impressed by the performances and the vocal style of Benoit. My hat is off to any man who can cover classic YES material as well as he does. In a number of the songs it was hard not noticing the similarity of Benoit with Anderson. Very, very close. BUT - nobody sings like Anderson and nobody can do these songs as well as Anderson. But Anderson, like his bandmates, is aging and his vocals may not be as intact as they were a number of years ago. But he is still singing, performing, and making new music.<br /><br />I give this recording five stars because it was good to hear this band live again, even if without Anderson and Rick Wakeman. Of course, Oliver Wakeman takes over the keyboard during this concert. And he does an amazingly good job covering for his dad. And the band itself isin top form here. Squire is the master of the base guitar. Howe is still one of the greatest guitar players ever. Alan White is still pounding out the beat in the background. And together they are tight and very much into the music.<br /><br />I hate to see YES without Anderson, who is the bands heart and soul, but he is surely not forgotten. He and Squire formed this band back in the sixties and without either one of them, YES is just another band. Even this colloboration of musicians outshines some of the newer bands of the day. They are truly in top form here. Hearing then belting out Heart Of the Sunrise and Starship Trooper is worth the price of the Cd. There song lineup is fabulous here and I applaud YES for staying in the playing field and giving us what they do best. Great Music.

145162445X|1.0|From a philosophical point of view, this book is embarrassing bad. There is a saying that anyone who ignores philosophy ends up doing bad philosophy, and this book is a prime example. You know that when Krauss says \\"Nothing is not really nothing\\" or \\"Nothing does not really mean `nothing,\\" you are in for a bad ride. He is just playing with words rather than answering a profound philosophical question of why there is something rather than nothing. He just changes the question to something he can answer with science -- why the universe went from state to another. Krauss has no answer to where the basic stuff of the \\"quantum void\\" came from -- where the stuff that \\"banged\\" in the Big Bang came from, as the physicist Alan Guth put it. Nor does he have an answer as to where the basic laws of the universe came from. He does not seem to gather that any laws have absolutely no bearing on the question of the elementary stuff of the universe came from or why the world has those particular laws or the kind of fields it has. (See David Alpert's review online in the New York Times for more.)<br /><br />Perhaps I should have given the book one or two more stars for the science, but his over the top misunderstanding of the philosophy question of why there is something rather than nothing contaminates his whole book.

1936608898|5.0|I have actually done a Whole 30 before, and it was a great way to eat healthier food (and lose weight). But as soon as that Whole30 was over, I went almost immediately back to eating how I had been eating, and everything fell right back apart.  Fast forward about a year to my considering doing another Whole 30. And then It Starts With Food comes out. And I read it. And I am transformed.<br /><br />This book is not simply an explanation of the diet they promote (which is pretty simple and does not require an entire book). This book is transformational. It explains HOW your body reacts to food. The initial chapters on hormones should be required reading for everyone.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMEND for anyone who wants to feel better, be healthier, or get a handle on their life.
B005GFPZYK|3.0|First, to Kyle and every other member of our Armed Forces, thank you!  You are a Patriot and a true American.<br /><br />This is a pretty good read starting out, but then it becomes the same thing over and over.  There's some great perspective and technical information buried in here, but the detail in the kills is lacking.  I'm not talking about gory details, I'm talking about things like \\"I killed 3 today\\"...  The book does take you through four tours into harms way; in itself, amazing!  And the incredible amount of kills and firefights is beyond belief while still being totally credible.  Several of the Sniper missions have good detail but there was sharper focus on the narcissistic telling of hazing events and bar fights than there was in the meat of the book...<br /><br />While I won't go as far as to say it wasn't worth the buy, there are better books where the story told is a more readable and engaging: Lone Survivor by Marcus Luttrell, for one.  Sniper had a chance to be really good, but the heartstrings never felt tugged and as you thought you were about to get some depth, the chapter would end.<br /><br />There's a lot of fact in this book and I'd rather spend money on an American hero than on some anti-American tale, so it hits more than it misses, but it's not something I'll read twice...  On the other hand, if you are looking for some decent insight into the SEAL psyche and the amazing career of America's best shooter, this is still pretty incredible.

B0019TSI8W|5.0|It's crazy how this movie touches the reality of life...it hits it right on the nose...This movie is wonderful! I just loved it!!
B0046ECFRM|5.0|I loooovvvvvve this book. There were some parts such as the touching of the statute that were not appropriate. I cant say anything bad about this book. Annna and the French kiss is my new favorite novel. I know that I will be reading it more than once. I love the relationship between St.Clair and Anna. There is obvious attraction between them. In the beginning Anna and St.Clair are friends but there is more underneath. They're Thanksgiving experience was so romantic. This was such a beautiful romance novel. St.Clair is so romantic and confident and yet so scared of rejection and change. The ending where St.Clair goes after Anna is so romantic. I felt like I was in the story. My heart beat rapidly just like the characters. I had a smile on my face from beginning to end. I even cried. St.Clair and Annago through ups and downs and misunderstanding together. It is so cute how St.Clair is so thoughtful and always tryst to cheer Anna up. I related to Anna and in some ways am like her. I would definately recommend Anna and the French Kiss. The dialogue was witty. I am in love with St.Clair. He is so hot with his accent, hair, eyes, personality, and thoughtfulness. Anna's and St.Clairs relationship is what everybody dreams of. I cant say enough about Anna and the French Kiss!!!!

0553805371|3.0|I enjoyed the book for its overview of classical physics and integration with sub-atomic theory. I saw the theme of the this book as: How Physics Will Soon Prove Away God. Hawking gives it his best shot. Of course, the idea of multiple universes and how they can appear out of nothing really becomes a chicken and egg construct. Early in the book he describes how a goldfish bowl universe can have provable laws of physics that are easily refuted by an observer outside the bowl. The author does indeed say our science may operate within a limited confine. How many layers of observers exist?  Hawking is an atheist and this book attempts to use physics to squish transcendent philosophy; I get it. He would likely explain away  profound spiritual experiences as a neural aberration of ischemic stroke. But, if the reality they describe is true, physics won't ever write a formula for it.
B000SW2F6M|5.0|My wife and I have thoroughly enjoyed this movie several times since purchasing it.  Orlando is a fantastic actor and we remember him from other movies, like Troy and Lord of the Rings.  Good entertainment and lots of action...with a good story.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great for all calculator needs! Simple and easy to read and use, I definately recommend this ap to Aol kindle fire users!
B00846REIS|5.0|I totally agree with those who loved this book more than 50 Shades of Grey. Its well written, characters are sophisticated, intelligent, strong and easy to fall in love with. Definitely waiting for the next book and hoping that the plot will be well developed and the author won't lose steam. Thank you for not turning this work of fiction into yet another whiney shallow book where the reader gets the impression that the author hastily put random words together and sell it as a book.
B005LAIH9A|4.0|After an endless number of god awful direct to Dvd sequels that really had nothing to do with the original storyline (with the exception of Eugene Levy), Universal finally got with it and decided to do what the fans have wanted since 2003. A true sequel featuring the people we grew to know and love like Jim, Michelle, Stifler, and all the rest. It was 9 years in the making, but the wait was worth it.<br /><br />Coming 9 years after \\"American Wedding\\", we catch up with the gang from East Great Falls. Someone made a mistake and missed the 10 year high school reunion, so they are having a 13 year reunion (although one wonders why not wait an extra two for the 15th?). The original gang all decide to return and attend the reunion, letting everyone in on what has gone on with their lives since we last saw them. Jim and Michelle (Jason Biggs, Alyson Hannigan) are still married and now have a small son. Stifler is, well, Stifler. No need to go into what everyone is up to, since that is part of the fun of watching the movie. Once everyone meets up again, it appears that old habits die hard, as more uproarious and dirty shenanigans and awkward situations arise in classic American Pie fashion.<br /><br />\\"American Reunion\\" does not miss a beat with the classic forumula that has come before in the first three films. It may be two different writers (Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg), but it feels like they were the writers of the first three. This movie is a warm trip back to nostalgiaville and doesn't pretend to be anything else but a movie trying to recapture the feel and tone of years past. Thank god. I wouldn't want it any other way. All the hallmarks we've come to expect (raunchy opening, bare breasts, bodily fluids, etc.) are here in full force, and they are as hilarious as ever. The cast is in fine form and all come back to their characters as if no time has passed. Naturally, Seann William Scott is the stand out as Stifler. He is still the same guy, which will probablynever change, but does find himself in an era where he does face that some things are different. Eugene Levy also has a bigger part in this one and it is hysterical with what they have given him to do in this one. It is also great to see those who were missing from 'American Wedding'. That was a fine sequel, but with a number of characters missing, there was just a feeling of incompleteness. This movie corrects that. Plus, they all look great. Some not having even changed a whole lot since we last saw them.<br /><br />Some people claim that we don't need another 'Pie' movie. Well, we don't need most of what we get. Why not just have fun and be entertained with characters and situations we like and enjoy? \\"American Reunion\\" is a movie that seems to be completely written and designed to be comfort food for fans who miss a certain era in time and in the movies that just isn't there anymore in these modern times. I won't remember most movies nowadays, but I will always remember the 'Pie' movies, and I will remember this one. What's also great is that the first three, especially the first one, were movies that had a heart. This movie also brings that back, but you feel it even more because you know these characters. You grew up with them over the years. It has a built in connection that actually makes you feel for these people and what happens that most one off films nowadays can't even begin to have.<br /><br />In the end, \\"American Reunion\\" is a movie that feels like the good ones we used to see back in the day. It leaves you feeling all warm and nostalgic like you yourself had just gone to a reunion. It's hysterical, heartfelt, raunchy, wild, and even a little touching. I, for one, would be most excited if there was another adventure with Stifler and the gang.
B001VVYQ6Q|5.0|Heard \\"Muelle de San Blas\\" in a bar in Puerto Rico and then another one of their songs on the radio down there. As soon as I got home I downloaded this album and I can say there's not a clunker on it. It's all good. Play it for your girlfriend, she'll love it!
B004LWZWGA|5.0|Back in 2005, when I first heard of this new reinvention of Batman courtesy of Christopher Nolan, I didn't know what to think. I had not known of Nolan's previous work, and just didn't know if this new take on the superhero legend would do it for me. Now, 7 years and 3 movies later, I can safely say that, oh yeah, it worked! And now, here we are at the end of Nolan's trilogy, which will no doubt go down as one of the greatest film trilogies of all time.<br /><br />I won't go into too great of detail, as it's stuff to discover as you watch, but these are the basics. \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" takes place eight years after the events of 'The Dark Knight'. Batman no longer exists as we learned he took the fall for the murder of Harvey Dent at the end of the last movie. Commissioner Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman) is the only one to know the truth. Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) has become a recluse and getting a Howard Hughes reputation among the citizens of Gotham City. But when a new evil strikes the city in the form of the hulking, mask wearing Bane (Tom Hardy, who sounds like an evil Sean Connery), and the sneaky cat burglar Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway) also appears on the scene, Bruce is pushed back into action and Batman returns to save his beloved city from utter destruction.<br /><br />Obviously, there is a lot more to it and a lot more to say, but part of the fun is watching this movie unfold with your own two eyes. Actually, it's hard to put into words what I think of this movie. It's really one of those \\"just go see it for yourself right now!\\" kind of movies. Timely and relevant, TDKR is a superhero movie that will be talked about decades from now. I don't know if I loved it more than TDK, but I loved it just as much. No one will ever be able to touch Heath Ledger's Joker, but the epicness of this movie is just unmatched. Director Christopher Nolan is a man with fierce talent. He films a Batman movie like no other. The movie is just large and epic in scope. Thankfully, Nolan also uses real, practical in camera effects and stunts when so many others would do everything in CGI. CGI probably is in use here, but it's completely seamless, and Nolan's use of doing practical effects is something more should get back to doing.<br /><br />Then there is the cast. This is the movie's strongest point. All of the returning regulars give the best performances of the entire trilogy, and that's saying something. We've known this Bruce Wayne for a few years and movies now, and you feel for him. You feel his pain, his sadness, etc. It's testament to Bale's acting and interpretation of the character. Michael Caine as Alfred has never been better. In fact, there will be a moment or two where he might have you in tears. Anne Hathaway holds her ground as well. She's confident in the role and has a way with delivering a humorous line. Her costume may not be as memorable as Michelle Pfeiffer, but she just may give Pfeiffer competition as the sexiest Catwoman ever. Tom Hardy as Bane is a hulking presence. I am not overly familiar with the character, but he is absolutely chilling. Hearing his Sean Connery meets Darth Vader voice come out of nowhere actually sends chills down your spine.<br /><br />Honestly, there is so much to say about TDKR, and so much more praise I can lay on it. But as I mentioned before, it's a movie that is best left to experience and see for oneself. Throwing in a few words here isn't really going to do it justice. The movie is just an amazing piece of work in what has been a phenomenal string of movies. Everything and everyone is top notch and in the finest form possible. TDKR is thrilling, chilling, emotional, epic and you just aren't quite sure how it's going to end. It's one of the best superhero movies ever.

B007PTJOV0|5.0|Four and a half stars aren't enough. This app is amazing in every way. This is like probably the best free kindle fire app out there. It's pretty much just Mario. Giving this 4 or lower stars is pretty much giving the original Mario itself a Four star rating. Once again, this app flies past my expectations and will continue to soar untill untill I beat the game.

B007BRSN72|5.0|This 2012 edition of Younger Than Yesterday is from Sony Japan. Like the other titles in the series (Mr. Tambourine Man; Turn! Turn! Turn!; Fifth Dimension; The Notorious Byrd Brothers), this disc incorporates Blu-Spec manufacturing technology but plays fine on a standard CD player.<br /><br />If you were to ask me if I think this disc offers improved sound over the 1996 Sony remaster, I would say \\"Not that I can hear.\\" But I don't have a high-end sound system. A true audiophile with a bitchin' sound system and an ear for such things might pick up nuances beyond my grasp (and my sound system's specs). If so, I would respect that person's findings. But to me, both this new import and the 1996 edition offer great sound. Yet there are some important distinctions to be made between these two versions released 16 years apart -- especially the first point here:<br /><br />1996 YTY: has just the stereo mix; I had only it to A/B with the 2012 edition's stereo mix; that's because the . . .<br />2012 YTY: has the stereo mix of the album AND its corresponding mono mix; having the mono mix again after all these years is the main reason I bought this import. I should emphasize here that Audio Fidelity released a mono CD of YTY last year, with remastering done by highly respected audio engineer Steve Hoffman. As I do not own a copy of that CD, I don't know how it and this 2012 Sony Japan version compare. (However, the Hoffman mono remaster has garnered quite favorable reviews.)<br /><br />1996 YTY: 6 bonus tracks (all in stereo)<br />2012 YTY: 3 bonus tracks (all in mono)<br /><br />1996 YTY: a 16-page booklet with David Fricke's excellent essay, Johnny Rogan's authoritative song notes, and some cool photos<br />2012 YTY: a 24-page, text-heavy booklet (almost all in Japanese, of course) with track listing and song lyrics in English.  Booklets for the other 2012s contain a few errors in the printed lyrics, but I haven't taken the time to thoroughly read the lyrics in this booklet; maybe they're error-free.<br /><br />1996 YTY: housed in a standard jewel case with a clear tray through which the original back cover photo shows<br />2012 YTY: housed in a beautifully rendered facsimile album jacket about half an inch taller than a standard plastic jewel case; the CD itself mimics a black vinyl record (complete with \\"grooves\\") with a red Sony Music label; it, like the 1996 remaster, has the iconic Columbia Records \\"walking eye\\" logo; the disc itself is snugly protected by a U-shaped sleeve<br /><br />Here's the track order for this new 2012 import edition of Younger Than Yesterday:<br />Tracks 1-11 are the mono mix of the original album.<br />Tracks 12-14 are the mono bonus tracks \\"Don't Make Waves\\" [single version]; \\"It Happens Each Day\\"; and \\"My Back Pages\\" [single version] -- with the second verse omitted, it clocks in at 2:32.<br />Tracks 15-25 are the stereo mix of the original album.<br /><br />Producer Gary Usher's stereo mix has such a wonderful spatial presentation. YTY in stereo is just a great listen -- always has been. It has a majestic quality to it. But decades ago, in the Age of Vinyl, YTY was, for me, the one Byrds album whose mono mix always competed with its stereo sibling for turntable time. Usher's mono mix is solid. And although this must seem counterintuitive to listeners who prefer their music in stereo, I think the mono mix -- at least of specific songs -- actually uncovers some of the instrumentation better than the stereo version does. Or, perhaps it's more accurate to say it aims the spotlight where it needs to be. For example, Clarence White's fabulous picking on \\"Time Between\\" is front and center in its mono mix. You can still hear it in the left channel of the stereo mix, and you can tell it's good, but it's still just part of the song's landscape. Chris Hillman's lead vocals on the song's mono mix also have more presence -- as they should. The percussion in the mono mix is also more conspicuous than it is in the stereo mix and adds a lot to the song's sense of urgency.<br /><br />Similarly, Roger McGuinn's fretwork on \\"So You Want To Be A Rock 'n' Roll Star\\" packs more punch in the mono mix -- again, because it's front and center. (On the other hand, Hugh Masekela's trumpet is better heard in the stereo version. It's prominent in the right channel while Roger's Ric-12 is prominent in the left.)<br /><br />Another notable mono/stereo difference pops up in \\"C.T.A.-102.\\" That little ascending piano run shortly before the alien voices appear is far more dramatic in the mono version. (In fact, for a moment there I thought I was listening to a passage from the Moody Blues' album, In Search Of The Lost Chord.) The mono mix of \\"The Girl With No Name\\" has a better payoff because, once again, Clarence's guitar fills and solo are front and center, and more Clarence is always a good thing.<br /><br />This is not to say the mono mix is packed with \\"all the good stuff\\" at the expense of the stereo mix. Far from it. In the album's stereo mix, \\"Have You Seen Her Face\\" has a longer fade (by 10 seconds) that's more engaging than the mono mix. The stereo mix of \\"Renaissance Fair\\" has that nifty little guitar fill from Roger just after the first refrain of \\"I think that maybe I'm dreamin'\\" near the end; the mono version doesn't have that -- or if it does it's buried in the mix. And there are some other nice moments in the stereo mix in which a particular instrument is showcased a little more.<br /><br />The upshot of all this is that each mix -- mono and stereo -- on this new 2012 edition has its distinctive elements and its particular joys. I would caution those of you unaccustomed to listening to pop and rock albums presented in mono that it is a very different experience from listening to those same albums in stereo. So please don't rush out and buy this pricey import just because I like both mixes. Remember, I grew up with both. Ultimately, the music itself is what matters most. Younger Than Yesterday remains one of the Byrds' finest works.reo mix and adds a lot to the song's sense of urgency.<br /><br />Similarly, Roger McGuinn's fretwork on \\"So You Want To Be A Rock 'n' Roll Star\\" packs more punch in the mono mix -- again, because it's front and center.

B00466HM28|4.0|At first, I wasn't really sure what to expect with this little keyboard. I had around a hundred dollars to spend on something for my studio, and this seemed like a great option considering it was also portable (I record with friends on the go a lot, and I needed to be able to throw it in my backpack). When I first got it, the keyboard very much impressed me with how it felt, but the pads felt a little stiff. Later, after getting an ASIO capable audio interface and fixing some laptop issues, this thing is amazing. Not only can I control Ableton Live or any other software that accepts MIDI CC signals with this, the keyboard holds up fantastically, it's light, portable, and actually professional looking even next to large mixers and controllers like the APC-40.<br /><br />My only serious complaint is this - the software that is bundled with this unit to change it's MIDI functions is completely unintuitive, and if you don't know MIDI, downright unusable. I figured it out though, and it does work with some tweaking. Also, the pads can't be played with drumsticks (should be obvious, I suppose, but they can't be), so don't go pounding away at them.<br /><br />Overall, this piece of gear has really helped out my studio, especially now that Ableton Live supports it as a native control surface. It's both a great MIDI piano and a great MIDI controller, especially since each function can be mapped to a different MIDI channel. I highly recommend this product.<br /><br />As a sidenote, it works on my Windows 7 PC, an XP box I tried it on, and of course flawlessly on my friend's MacBook Pro. Driver issues seem nonexistant. Very nice, and rare for a such a cheap product.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is a fun pass time. It keeps you playing because you can get powers and upgrades in the game. I positively love this tricky suspensful endeavor. I strongly recommend this product.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Totally worth the few bucks, this game is just as fun as &quot;Where's my water?&quot; The new play elements add a new twist to the puzzles.
0670022411|5.0|So very pleased with my purchase and will definitely be ordering from you again in the near future!! The book is in great condition just as described and I got it at such a great price. Delivery very prompt
B008MEM24S|5.0|Well,  if you like Where's My Water,  then you're going to love this game.  There's actually a bit more of a storyline in this game. Works great in the original Galaxy Tab.
0439023521|5.0|You may as well buy all 3 books now. The characters are so engaging that as soon as you read the last page, you'll be reaching for the next book.
B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|I love this cd!!! Every song is good. I especially like LIES GREED MISERY and the first song LOST IN THE ECHO. I love it.
B004SBS8LA|2.0|The game itself is really fun &amp; I think better than the original Angry Birds however the sheet number of ads now is obnoxious! After every single attempt at a board you get interrupted by a full screen as you then have to close before moving on...I would much rather pay a couple of dollars for this game than deal with these annoying ads (why does the title say ad-free?). It didn't used to be like this, uninstalling, will try Google play.version to make sure it's the same thing but I'm not keeping it if it is.
B00846TRHY|5.0|The title \\"MACHINE GUN PREACHER\\" sounds like any other cheesy action flick, maybe even a low budget bad acted one. My 18 year old son didn't even watch it as when I told him the title he rolled his eyes and said \\"Oh that really sounds like a good one\\". I had sort of the same reaction from my wife who said she would watch but preceded to grab a blanket & pillow before coming to the couch. Her habit is to sleep while I watch a movie she has lost interest in. However she stayed awake and watched it all the way through. Very powerful movie. Well acted. Very disturbing & true story. This isn't a light feel good movie. The title came from a newspaper story back when this was going on apparently. I would recommend this movie.
B007Y5IAV0|5.0|I love SOAD but if Serj keeps putting out records like these 3 so far then I'm not complaining at all! Best solo album by a former group artist since Plant's Manic Nirvana!<br />The songs are just amazing and worth every penny. Some tracks I wasn't as impressed with the first listen grew on me and then I realized something: Had a song like Forget Me Not been someone else's single I would have listened to it over and over again, just where it is now sandwiched in with such other utter greatness it can't shine on its own. You know what I'm saying? Its that damn good!<br /><br />Anyway, I could gush for hours but I think I'd rather go listen to the CD again!<br /><br />Hope this helps,<br />~R~
B007D5DUBG|5.0|I was a big fan of the first album and wasn't disappointed with the ep.  It has 3 new songs and two really good live versions of old songs.  I can hardly wait for a full length record now and if they ever tour near Sacramento I'm so going to see them!

B000NY17J6|4.0|I bought this CD for the purported remastering of these classic tracks, and it was well-warranted.  Both Linda's vocals and the instrumentation are much cleaner than on the previous CD issues.  I've been wanting a cleaner, less-muddled master of \\"Silver Threads and Golden Needles\\" for years.  Nice touch.  The sound is balanced without being overdone.
B007SSEBCU|2.0|The content of the movie was very well done. The quality of the \\"feed\\" was less than acceptable. There were breaks in the video and audio. We became so annoyed at the broken up scenes, we went out and rented the movie from another provider. I'm assuming this was just a fluke. We will still rent from you again.
B00846REIS|5.0|This book blew me away, brought me back and blew me away again. The chemistry between Eva and Gideon is beyond anything I've ever read in my life! The attraction? HOT! The romance? HOT! The sex? EVEN HOTTER!!!! There was never a dull moment reading this book. You will feel sad, hurt, pissed, happy, everything. I loved that both of the characters have troubled pasts that affect their relationships. This romance is NOT all sunshine and flowers like so many others. It shows you the dark, possessive,and needy side of love that most like to pretend doesn't exist. Some say this is a rip off of Fifty Shades, I say its BETTER than Fifty Shades. This book has way more depth and the characters are way more interesting. I recommend this book everyday.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|my 3 year old and I play this game as part of his bedtime routine and he loves it!  He looks forward to getting to the next level before lights out!!!

0062107062|5.0|Good book that articulates the issues that snipers must deal with, beyond the mechanical aspects of shooting. I bought the large type copy for a friend that has a hard time seeing-he loved it.
B001HXG8PK|1.0|i would very much love to own this as the music is a great listening experience and the second disc (while many complain about it)is great as some of the best music never included on the first one is finally released. i only buy cds now due to recently losing my music in a recent computer wipeout and just find discs safer and while i want this, what greedy people would charge $1000 for it. that's not ethically right in anyway, i thought it was expensive when i checked to find it was $60 but $1000. that's not happening you insane money grubbing.... i'm sorry im a bit flustered at this. i may be alone in this, but that's just wrong.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|My grandkids love the ability of this app to make interesting, easy pieces of art that can be saved to albums or to the gallery and shared to my PC.  Once there, I can use them as computer wallpaper or attach them to emails and help them send home to parents, their other grandmother, etc.  The digitized files are so much neater than boxes of art supplies and the finished files look better on my computer screen than printed paper on my fridge!  In any event, it is a simple app, easily used by kids, and a lot of fun to play with.
B004SBX112|5.0|The game is fun!  I purchased it for my 11 year old daughter and it was a big hit!  The Angry Bird games seem to be something kids love.  When we are in the car or someplace boring for her where she can't talk on \\"the phone\\", I hand her my tablet and she is perfectly happy to play the game for hours....
B007VUA7VO|5.0|the app is very solid. it displays good stats for the kindle. for the most part, all the info is accurate and i honestly dont see anything wrong.
B002EWD0I6|5.0|This is a wonderful series of dvd's. A must have for period piece fans. I have watched over and over.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I recently purchased Wool from the Kindle store after a recommendation from my mother. She had read about it in a magazine and it sounded good so I decided to read it. It is definitely one of the best books I have read this year...the storyline and concept behind the book are so easy to get into! Howey tells a very interesting story of what civilization might be like in a hundred years. I found it to be very thought-provoking and some of the themes are very relevant to what is happening right now in society. I would definitely recommend this book to a friend!
B006XF5BTG|4.0|A nice introduction for several essetial concepts in muscle building world.<br />Although it shows  clear and scientific concepts some of the advices about how to make a workout routine are purely based on the author's mind as oposed to well grounded research.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I recieved this movie and enjoyed every minute of it.  The movie was clear and had no scratches.  I did not get a chance to go and see this movie in the Theatre but heard great reviews and decided to add this to my collection.  I would recommed this in anyones collections and to bring out a evening of \\"girls night out.\\"
B007NESBK2|5.0|I've always enjoyed Sade's music, live (once), on CD, DVD and now Blu-Ray. Bring me home is the second best of the bunch right behind actually being at the concert. Well, wait, there's no traffic in or out at home, I can freely use the bathroom when I need to, food and drinks are free (sorta) and my system brings me pretty damn close to actually being there (in feeling anyway). So, I don't know, the blu-ray could actually tie for first, even with traffic and all there's nothing quite like being at the show. Anyway, Sade have turned up the wick just enough to make this particular concert even more fun than the last few. The backdrops, images and that extra little bit of energy in the songs really come across plus the show feels somewhat more intimate compared to either of the previous two tours. These songs refuse to age as obviously does Sade herself, they sound as good as ever and she seems to become more beautiful as time passes. Minor criticisms (and, who am I?) is that I wish the guys would really let loose on some of the songs, like they'd really let rip with a slashing solo on guitar, sax or the drums. I don't mean that rehearsed jam they usually do at the end of smooth operator (not in this show) but actual improvisational riffing and jamming. They obviously have the chops so let em go! Other than that this is a very enjoyable blu-ray concert, one that I don't believe you even have to be a Sade super fan to enjoy. Although I have a surround sound system I've only listened to the PCM stereo track and it sounds very good, I played it pretty loud and you could still hear each instrument doing it's individual thing while coming together as a whole. The video can look a little grainy at times, especially for a blu ray but there are a lot of background lighting effects and such that could be adding to that perception. I give the audio (PCM stereo) 4.5 stars outta 5 and the video 4 out of 5 due to that occasional graininess. I give the Blu-ray 5 stars overall because it's just plain fun music to listen and jam along to.
B008MEM24S|5.0|great game. 4 levels with 20 boards each. looks great, plays great, it is great...if u don't mind swampy switched to Perry, which this cat prefers.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Great game!  It's a continuation of where's my water.  So far it is pretty much the same game but changed just enough to keep this kind of game fresh and enjoyable.  Well worth a buck.  Now they need to drop the ridiculous price of the mystery duck levels.
6304039506|2.0|For those of us who have seen this play performed on stage, this movie is a massive disappointment.  Then again, it is directed by Elia Kazan, who can never leave excellence alone but is compelled to damage it.  For no understandable reason, Kazan cuts scenes mercilessly, destroys speeches, re-arranges events.  What he does to Williams' extraordinary play is even worse than what Mike Nichols and Taylor/Burton did to Albee's brilliant \\"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\\"  Even this film version of the play, which purports to restore what the Hayes Code censors excised from the film, is virtually worthless.  Blanche's escapade with her student, the whole tale of discovering her husband's homosexual relationship with an older friend (to say nothing of his subsequent suicide), Stanley and Stella's raw lust and magnetism for each other, and the rich and vulgar quality of the language of \\"The Quarter\\" are all missing.  And what's the point?  But the biggest atrocity occurs at the end of the play.  Instead of the ending Williams' wrote, Kazan changes the whole play by having Stella leave Stanley.  Good grief! Could any action short of having Stella kill Stanley be any more absurd?<br /><br />See a full-blown stage production rather than buying this film, despite the excellence of the cast.
B008645YEE|5.0|I was extremely excited for this score, and - in short - it's passed my high expectations and manages to ramp up the \\"epicness\\" even more than the Dark Knight's score, which I doubted was possible until hearing this! Zimmer manages to bring old sounds back from the first two scores, which tie things together well (almost too well at times, some parts are copy/paste jobs from previous scores) but he almost always incorporates something to freshen things up!<br /><br />That being said there were a few things I wasn't crazy about on this score. The first and most glaring was the way the chant was mixed into things. I was expecting the chant to be a very prominent part of this score, with variable performances (maybe even some that would border on screaming the chant). Unfortunately not only does the chant get mixed relatively into the background in the tracks it appears, but there's nothing in the way it sounds to even suggest it's any different than the recording we got in the trailers, back before Zimmer's big \\"record your own chant!\\" promotion. That's not to say I don't still LOVE the sounds of the chant and they really add an interesting flair when it appears (not to mention the novelty of the 5/4 time in Bane's music, which is unique and refreshing amongst a lot of current scores).<br /><br />I was also dissappointed by the new themes included. The \\"Catwoman\\" theme, if you want to call it that (they never specifically call her \\"Catwoman\\" in the movie) is interesting and the echoey piano is a nice change from the dark strings, but ultimately the theme doesn't go very far - only appearing on the album once (though the cymbal sounds backing it crop up subtly a few times), and in the film twice. I would have liked to hear a bit more of it, perhaps vary the instrumentation a bit. Finally, the chromatic lines are reminescent of Zimmer's Sherlock scores, not a bad thing but worth noting.<br /><br />While working on The Dark Knight, Zimmer had made a promise that the Batman \\"theme\\" would be expanded upon to it's fullest variation in this final score. He claimed that what we hear in Dark Knight was \\"just a small taste\\" of the grand theme he had in store. However as far as I can tell this expansion is not found anywhere in the score, for any of the major themes for batman (the two note \\"heroic fanfare\\", the Da Vinci Code-esque \\"emotional theme\\", and the darker batman theme heard on low basses/cellos). So I was dissappointed by this lack of expansion. The most we get is the two note horn fanfare gains a few extra notes in \\"Imagine the Fire\\" which is a fantastic track.<br /><br />There is one moment of EXCELLENT thematic development in the score that is only heard on the bonus track \\"No Stone Unturned\\" which can be found with the physical CD as a download. In the last minute of this track we hear the two note horn fanfare changed into a two note cello ostinato, which shifts keys and eventually settles into F major, which is simply fantastic if you're musical enough to notice and appreciate the variation presented there. It can be heard in the beginning of the film when Gordon goes to give his speech about Harvey Dent, and it's wonderful sounding :)<br /><br />----<br /><br />All in all this is a GREAT score by Zimmer, and easily the best of the three Batman Scores. Unlike the Dark Knight which felt like it was missing music in the initial release, if one is able to collect the four bonus tracks available online for this score you really have a fairly complete collection of the music in the film (except perhaps a few tracks for more intimate scenes). Having seen the film and heard the music in it I can say confidently that all major parts of the score are well represented. Also, unlike The Dark Knight this score also has most of the tracks in chronological ordering (with a few exceptions, however some tracks are repeated in the film in a few places) and the way many tracks flow into the next is nice and makes for an enjoyable experience.<br /><br />GET THIS SOUNDTRACK if you enjoy Hans Zimmer's music for the Batman series. If you need to own only one score, get this one over The Dark Knight or Batman Begins, for it's by far the most epic and intense of the three, and just well done all around.<br /><br />If you can manage to collect all of the bonus tracks available, personally I've found this to be a good track listing that puts the tracks in mostly the right order and maintains connected tracks/makes a good listening experience. Feel free to comment if you have other track orderings you like:<br /><br />1. A Storm Is Coming<br />2. On Thin Ice<br />3. Gotham's Reckoning<br />4. Mind If I Cut In?<br />5. Underground Army<br />6. Born In Darkness<br />7. The Fire Rises<br />8. Nothing Out There<br />9. All Out War (Bonus Track from ticket sale)<br />10. Despair<br />11. Fear Will Find You<br />12. Why Do We Fall?<br />13. Death By Exile<br />14. The Shadows Betray You (Mp3 Bonus Track)<br />15. Risen From Darkness (CD Bonus Track)<br />16. Imagine The Fire<br />17. No Stone Unturned (CD Bonus Track)<br />18. Necessary Evil<br />19. The End (Mp3 Bonus Track)<br />20. Rise<br /><br />My final note...the remix tracks at the ends of Zimmer's scores need to stop...nobody's buying this score for a random [not even that good] dubstep song where more score could have been put in. It's not TERRIBLE...but even so...
0143119680|5.0|Finally a book that has a unique and mature take on traditionally overdone topics of witches, vampires, romance, etc.  Unlike the Twilight series (and I hesitate to make the comparison as the only real thing they have in common is vampires and romance), this will be a joy for mature educated readers.  The romance is portrayed realistically, logically, and in a manner that leaves it often uncertain--as in real life. The pace keeps your attention, as Deborah Harkness is very talented in creating poignant vignettes that are like intimate islands along the river of her tale.<br /><br />Some reviews I read made Harry Potter comparisons to this novel. Don't let that turn you away, as A Discovery of Witches is NOTHING like HP.<br /><br />Deborah H. has created a distinctive spin on otherwise commonly used elements!<br /><br />P.S. In college I had three years of art history, which greatly enhanced my understanding of some of the environments and objects described in the book. BUT. Even if you don't know what an Italian Savonarola folding chair looks like, don't let that turn you away; it's not all antique furniture and history references, you'll just appreciate it in a different way if you have a background in history or art.
B0001CCY7E|5.0|Thank You, it is so much easier to work listening to the movie soundtrack...New Job has me behind desk all day, now I can tolerate it and zone out...GREAT CD.
B008MEM24S|5.0|this is just like where's my water. Except its a little more exciting.  I cannot stop playing it! I llike all of the customizable options too. might be even better than where's my water.
0439023521|5.0|To tell or not to tell ?<br />I normally don't like to watch the movie before reading the book--<br />I loved the book more then the movie...<br />Can't wait to read Part II.
1439181780|4.0|With what is happening in these times with the economy as it is, this book can and will change the way to approach life with a little more confidence. It will change your attitude for the better. Life is not as bad as you may think it to be. Change the way you think.
B006G2124E|5.0|This movie is good in several ways. First it shows the compasion of one(this number grows) person for her friends & neighbors (black & white). Second, she does something to right a wrong even though its done in a sneaky way. I could go on but you need to watch, plus its Funny!
B003YOASY2|5.0|Although they are better known more for their acting these guys can play. Got this Album when it first came out and still play it all the time. So far this is there best album but their other albums are great as well.
B007KZY1YY|2.0|I found this book frustrating. Titillating yes but very little character development and demeaning to women.<br />I bought the second of the trilogy but could not finish it. I found I just did not care about any of the characters and it was very repetitive.
B006LSZECO|5.0|That's how good this book is! The first half or so is rather depressing, but then BAM!  I finished this book feeling a little dazed, like someone just slapped me upside the head. The planning, the attention to detail, the execution was just so perfect. I would turn to my husband reading next to me, look at him funny for a while, then repeatedly ask &#34;You know I love you, right?&#34; This one will keep you up really late at night.
B0062NAX1U|3.0|I've watched all of the Sherwood films (many times) and love them all, but this one falls short. The acting is bad. It seems unfinished and rushed, especially the ending. The scenes are disjointed and don't flow together. It felt like the writers and producers were trying to say too many different things and jammed them all into one story. Too many characters with too many subplots.<br /><br />Some scenes were not explained. For example, the character Javier Martinez was jobless in one scene, and fully employed in the next. What? Where did this job come from? Minor complaint: when Javier was called to the boss's office, the two other men looked like they had stepped out of a 60s movie (clothes and hairstyles) though this movie is set in modern-day. That was jarring and distracting.<br /><br />The cop stealing evidence was out of left field. This new info suddenly appeared near the end of the movie without any foreshadowing.<br /><br />Good message about fathers standing up and doing the right thing for their family, but a bad movie. Thank goodness I borrowed it from the library--I waited in line for seven months--instead of buying a copy. It is not one I'd watch again.
B007R41E8O|5.0|I like a game that has people people guessing what will happen next and how the objects give u insight to what is going on in the story. I have only tried this game for a few minutes and I'm impressed by the storyline.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is just the Calculator app I was hoping to find for my Kindle fire. The simplest form of calculator for general math to use when balancing my checkbook paying bills, shopping online or leaving a tip. Super easy to use with large 'buttons' and large legible numbers. And it's FREE. I'm loving it.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Christopher Nolan's triumphant, apparently final installment in his Batman saga, THE DARK KNIGHT RISES, is a compelling, exciting piece of modern filmmaking - more of a direct sequel to its initial entry, \\"Batman Begins,\\" than its immediate predecessor, the repetitive \\"The Dark Knight.\\"<br /><br />Set several years after the events of TDK, Gotham City finds itself once again under siege - this time from a mercenary named Bane (Tom Hardy) who wears a mask and talks like a muffled version of Darth Vader by way of Christopher Plummer in \\"Star Trek VI.\\" Nobody has seen The Batman since the night of Harvey Dent's death, with Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale, seeming less uptight this time around) hiding out as a recluse in Wayne Manor, much to the chagrin of Alfred (Michael Caine), who just wants to see his master join the ranks of the living again. Bruce's world is initially perked up by a cat burglar named Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway), who's gotten herself wrapped up in the new world order that Bane's \\"Occupy Gotham\\" army represents - but it's just a teaser for the resurrection of Batman himself, who's desperately needed by its residents and a beleaguered Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman), who finds a new ally in crusading young cop John Blake (Joseph Gordon-Levitt).<br /><br />\\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" is confident, visually compelling and just a bit overlong. The script, by Nolan and his brother Jonathan, is better balanced than the redundant structure of \\"The Dark Knight,\\" which found Batman continuously trying to save Gotham, only to be thwarted by a psychotic act from The Joker. This picture is less sadistic as well, with more of a redemptive finale that proves to be enormously satisfying as Nolan at last breaks out of the constant doom and gloom that the last picture was dominated by.<br /><br />Most of the additions to the cast help enormously, from Hathaway's fetching turn as Catwoman and Gordon-Levitt's tireless police detective, to welcome on-screen appearances by veteran actors Matthew Modine and William Devane, and a few surprise cameos from veterans of Nolan's earlier Batman pictures. Bane himself is a little goofy, but Hardy packs a muscular presence, and series veterans Caine and Oldman have several fine scenes as well. Less effective is Marion Cotillard's red herring role as the new head of Wayne Enterprises and Bruce's latest love conquest - given where the story ultimately concludes, there should have been more of the relationship between Bruce and Selina, though romanticism has never been one of Nolan's strong suits.<br /><br />A few elements also fall short - a somewhat bloated stretch where Bruce finds himself in Bane's prison drags the film down with Batman sidelined for too long a duration (ironic that, no matter if it's Burton, Schumacher or Nolan, the focus always seems to drift off the Caped Crusader in every one of these pictures). There's a bit too much Bane and several pretentious, accompanying monologues, while Hans Zimmer's ridiculously over-scored soundtrack feels the need to punctuate every scene - even the quieter dramatic beats - like a sledgehammer.<br /><br />Still, it's hard to envision fans and casual viewers alike not being satisfied with this rousing third installment. Speaking of which, though billed as the concluding entry in Nolan's trilogy, it also doesn't feel like the end, unless the director is truly content in ending his series with some light finally infiltrating the darkness.
B004I744AS|5.0|Great Dictionary app. I'm a fairly good speller but I like to double check my spelling when posting or blogging and this app is just what I need and easy and fun to use. It also lists synonyms and antonyms which will help me with my crossword puzzles and other word games. Additionally, it is a Thesaurus which will also help in that respect and when writing cards and letters.  And the big PLUS, it's FREE. Excellent!
B004UHSB5A|1.0|This game does not work well on the kindle fire. The dominos do not stay in play if you can even get them there. It is a total waste of money and they say you can not exchange it. I will not buy another game from amazon unless I can play it before then buy. This game is defective.
0345803485|3.0|What started out as a real page turner for me ended up being a slog through cold molasses just to finish what I started.<br />In my humble opinion, this could have stopped at the first book. I loved #1! It was a little unusual, sexy and kept me interested.<br />Then came Book #2, which was okay but started to turn into cutesy drivel searching for a story line. It completely lost it's edge.<br />By the time I picked up #3, I was so tired of the freakishly repetitive expressions/words that I almost didn't get through it. Thesaurus anyone? It then quickly pulled a bunch stories together and wrapped them up within a few pages each like simple afterthoughts....or maybe the Publisher said \\"Wrap this b**ch up already!\\"<br />For me, the worst part was that I started out thinking this was about a Dom and his Sub which was hot and fun but they turned into a sickening sappy couple of Boobs.<br />I knew I was in the \\"land of no return\\" the moment poor F***ked-Up Christian took a complete about-face in his personality, principals,lifestyle etc; it was totally unbelievable. A leopard doesn't change spots the way it was depicted in this story.  E.L. shouldn't have made him so damaged ....and then match him to such an arbitrary, spoiled and argumentative character like Anna.
030758836X|1.0|Loved this book right up to the final chapter. Hate, hate, hate the ending! Didn't fit the story and was a cheap co-out. Don't read this!!

0345803485|1.0|I'm not a fan of this book. I mean no harm to those who do like the series, but it was just not for me.<br /><br />I will not be moving forward to pt two, (Possible Spoiler)***but instead choosing to believe that the story ends here with Ana coming to her senses and leaving the control freak.***<br /><br />In my mind this book is an insult to any woman, or man for that matter, who has ever been in an abusive/controlling relationship and had to fight their way out. Also if the writer were truly familiar with her subject matter she would understand that the BDSM lifestyle is nothing like she has portrayed in this book. This was a book club pick which is the only reason that I stuck with it to the end. Friends who have read it and recommended it all said the same thing, \\"It's not about the sex, it's about the story and the relationship between the two characters.\\" What I saw was a controlling infatuation of a relationship. No love but pure infatuation. A relationship based completely on sex and a dream of what you could make the other person into. To all the women out there, this is not love. I found MR. GREY to be the classic manipulative/abusive male, he states over & over that he wants to hurt her and wants to punish her because he needs to. I've read other erotica that I did find entertaining, so please don't think that I'm one of those people who don't understand the genera. This just wasn't a book for me, and I'm praying that young girls who read this don't go out looking for this kind of male.
B008MEM24S|2.0|I have tried downloading this multiple times and it still hasn't loaded yet. I love the game &quot;Where's my Water&quot; and wanted to play this version but it will not download!!!
0385341008|4.0|This was a book club pick that I didn't really have any hopes for. The only reason I started it at all is that I have enjoyed every book picked by this member so far. With that in mind I dove in hoping to just get through it quick. I found myself engrossed in certain parts of the story, and wishing I new Isola as my own friend. That I could live in a cottage on that island, post war of course. It was a fast read, seeing as how the entire story is made up of letters, but also very enjoyable.
0060594896|5.0|One of my favorite parts of the book was the journalist tracking down the grandmother responsible for all those stories about a woman lifting a car off her grandchild.<br /><br />The original event happened in the late 70's in Florida to a woman named Laura Shultz, who was 63 at the time. Her grandson was trapped underneath a Buick, and she lifted the back end off his arm. Peak Performance author Dr. Charles Garfield tried to get an interview with her, but she refused, unwilling to talk about \\"the event.\\"<br /><br />After much convincing she finally told him she didn't like to think about what happened sharing, \\"If I was able to do this when I didn't think I could, what does that say about the rest of my life? Have I wasted it?\\"<br /><br />You don't have to waste another day, and neither did Laura, she became a professor, her lifelong dream.<br /><br />Another thing Canfield shares among dozens of principles is a party he went to where everyone lived their dream life. The other people at the party would say to the guest, \\"I loved seeing you on Oprah\\" or to another, \\"I can't believe you went to the moon for NASA, that is amazing!\\"<br /><br />Canfield shared that the party helped implant into the participants subconscious the ability to see the dream realized. This book goes far beyond \\"how to set a goal and make a plan\\" and talks about real techniques that work. Read it!

1582701709|5.0|One, Byrne deserves credit for bringing this 5000 year old technology to many peoples attention. The controversy is that she says the Law of Attraction is responsible for everything, including evil (even genocide) in an individual and society's life. I was a pastor for 10 years. Prayer and the LOA are very similar, and the reason neither works has nothing to do with the principle but with the practitioner. Prayer is not saying, \\"God, help me with...\\" The average American prays 2 minutes a day, and clergy fare little better, averaging around 6 minutes A DAY. People treat the LOA the same. Byrne emphasizes over and over the importance of belief mixed with emotion (excitement over already having what one desires). Her emphasis has led to others emphasizing this, much as books about prayer emphasize this. HOWEVER, she clearly states, and needed to state over and over, the ONE thing each contributor has in common is they meditate/pray for ONE HOUR A DAY. That is the 'secret' many people miss. This is not a 2 minute practice, this is an hour a day EVERY day. That is focus, with passion, mixed with strong belief, that over time builds up the energy to draw what you want into your life. Think about it, try to go to the gym for 3 minutes a day and see if you get results. You will get nothing. Now go to the gym for 1 hour a day every day and watch your body transform. Want prayer and the LOA to work? Then read the books suggestions about passion and be sure you spend an hour a day with the practice. Otherwise you will be one more critic claiming this doesn't work.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I was swept away by Wool--the setting, the use of language, the characters and the somber tone of loss and hope that pervades the series of interrelated stories caused me to read the entire thing in a matter of days. Except for the second story in the Omnibus which dragged a little for me, I thought the pacing was terrific. Howey throws surprises at readers, but never anything cheap and out of left field.<br /><br />Reading this book, you get a true sense of another world--fully realized and populated with flesh and blood. It has echoes of Hunger Games in its evolving plotline of post-apocalyptic life, societal castes and secrets withheld, but where Hunger Games often felt a little overblown and interested in romance or action, Wool is a more serious-minded tale that demands thought and consideration.<br /><br />The world in which Wool is set is rich, with many more stories to tell, and I was pleased to see the Q&A at the end of the Omnibus Edition. Howey says, \\"There are many more stories to tell,\\" and I am looking forward to him sharing them!
1451629184|4.0|I had been off at college when Jaycee Lee Dugard was was returned alive to her family and was too young to understand what was going on when the event first took place. I found out about this case while watching a documentary. I was astonished at how all of this happened while I was alive and I had not even heard of it. As soon as I saw the documentary, I went off to the library so I could read the story that day while the documentary was fresh in my mind. I am astonished by the bravery that Jaycee Dugard displays in this memoir (and in subsequent interviews afterwards) and I appreciate how she has come out as an advocate for this cause while still keeping the privacy of her children. The memoir is outstanding, though it was tough to read at times for obvious reasons. It was a quick read and definitely should be read by anyone who was alive during this period of time so that we can all learn from our history.
B007IHH3L2|5.0|This review is of the Sony Legacy remastered vinyl double LP version of Raw Power. Firstly, the production values are top notch, the cover photo is beautfully presented on high grade card and the additional track listing for the Iggy re-mix is tastefully added on the back cover. The 16 page colour booklet is of the same high standard and has large print so those of us that are getting on can read it without reaching for the glasses. The content in the booklet is fairly light on and will be common knowledge to Stooges or Iggy aficionados but the glossy pictures are great. Both the LP's I received were very cleanly pressed and had no popping or tracking problems. I would go as far as saying that I consider these 120 gram pressings sound a lot better than most of the 180 gram re-issues around at the moment. This is due in no small way to the care and attention to detail that Sony has applied to every aspect of this product. Or maybe it's because the only other copies of this album I've ever seen were the battered and tattered treasure of a hard living loon. Now to the music.<br />The original Bowie mix of this album is often derided or scoffed at by fans and critics alike, however, it is the version I grew up listening to and learned to love for all of its so called flaws. The most common of these complaints are the tinny sound and the absence of bass. The remastered version is still trebly and not very bassy but has a much better separation of the instruments than the original vinyl pressing. So if you are familiar with this album you will not be disappointed it still is the Raw Power we know and love. If you aren't familiar with the album you may prefer the more standard rock mix of the album by Iggy. Either way it's a win win situation because the songs of course are great
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|I had originally seen this movie in the movie theater and I instanly liked it, so when the DVD came out I purchased it without giving it a second thought. The plot is clever, the writing is witty and the Paris scenes are just beautiful. It's no wonder that Woody Allen won an academy award for best original screenplay.<br /><br />I have to say though, that I was disappointed when the DVD cover was revised adding the pictures of the supporting actors. When the DVD first came out, the pictures of the actors were not on the cover the way you see them lined up on top, obstructing the glorious view of the famous painting by Van Goh. I loved the original cover, I thought it was clever with the main character walking along the Seine river under a gorgeous swirly sky created by Van Goh taken from one of his famous paintings.<br /><br />If you love art and literature, you'll appreciate this movie that much more. This movie takes you on a trip to a present and past Paris.
0765316994|5.0|The problem with many science fiction stories are that they're loaded with cliches and overused plot devices.  The excellence of John Scalzi's Redshirts can be attributed to the fact that it's loaded with cliches and overused plot devices.  It clearly demonstrates that the difference between success and failure in storytelling has less to do with the material and more with the execution.<br /><br />Redshirts tells the story of the starship Intrepid which goes from dangerous mission to dangerous mission.  The principal officers always survive - usually saved by some solution seemingly pulled out of thin air - but at least one lesser crew member dies.  These crew members are Redshirts:  not because of the color of their uniforms, but because, like the hapless and doomed throwaway characters on Star Trek (who typically were clad in red), they are killed seemingly to make every mission more meaningful.<br /><br />The hero of Redshirts is ensign Andrew Dahl who soon realizes that he is a redshirt.  Veteran crew members know better than to go on away missions, but Dahl has yet to learn this fact.  And the high fatality rate among crew members is only oneof the mysteries of the Intrepid.  There's the apparently death-proof main officers, including the Captain and the Science Officer and the incredible healing ability of another officer.  There's the mysterious box that provides miraculous cures.  And more. Dahl will try to figure out what's going on and how to stop it.  An absurd problem requires an absurd solution which he will have to implement.<br /><br />To reveal what's going on would spoil the fun, and even when you think you understand, Scalzi throws in another twist or two.  Thematically, Scalzi wants to remind the readers that even the minor characters in stories are people not to be disregarded lightly.  In this vein, in addition to the novel, there are three \\"codas\\" that tells the stories of minor characters within the main story.  This is a fun and funny tale,though it would be best appreciated by science fiction fans; to others, it might seem too inside-jokey.

B000XUBFE2|5.0|I listened to the audio version of this book and I absolutely loved it. The narrator can make or break a book, and in this case, he was perfect. I didn't really know what to expect from the book before I started. I don't like to read too much of the description before I start because I don't want to read too many spoilers. I was a little hesitant because I did know it was set during the time of the holocaust and I feared it would be too emotionally draining. However, I decided to read it because of the good reviews. Told from a unique point of view, I found the books style to be fresh and new. To me the story was like an unexpected flower among a patch of brown and withered grass. The story slowly grows and unfolds to reveal its beauty amongst the darkness of the times that surround them. The book was not what I expected. It made me laugh, it made me cry, it took me on little twists and turns. It made me think about how much we take for granted all that we have. It made me think about being human, the darkness and light that exists in all of us.<br />  If you are lover of books, you will appreciate this book even more as the story unfolds.<br />  After I finished, I started to read some of the reviews. I came across one that said the audiobook was great, but this is a book that you need to \\"see\\". Wondering what that meant , I went to amazon and \\"took a look\\" inside the book. To my surprise I found the author used different size fonts to accentuate the narrators thoughts against the story that was told. Another piece of how the storytelling is so unique in this book. Now I'm considering buying the book to experience it another way!
B007I2BZIE|5.0|I'm continually amazed by these three great musicians. Geddy's voice just keeps going and Alex is always inventing new sounds with his guitar. The solos are longer on this album and of course the writing by Mr. Peart is an interesting and unusual story. All the lyrics are printed along with great illustrations and pictures. It's great to follow along while listening through the old headphones.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Its amazing that you can still find great books like these for only a few dollars these days. The story's were fantastic, action packed, suspenseful, and each one had a great surprise ending. I buy tons of books each month and I strongly recommend that anyone read these. I'm trying to get my kids to read this book now!
B005RJ6AIK|5.0|My wife and I love Hawaiian music and when we saw \\"The Decendants\\" we knew we just had to have that tract.  We received it in a very short time and have been enjoying it ever since.  We put the disk on the stereo and let it play softly in the background as we go about our daily activities.  Gabby Pahinui and island music really go together.  Man, is it a soothing feeling.<br /><br />Good sale, good delivery, good product from Amazon as usual.

B004LWZWGK|1.0|I need to re-evaluate everything because right now I'm gobsmacked by all the raving reviews. In some ways I feel like a villain. Ive become bitter and cynical about society today in the same vain as every batman villain to ever  grace us with their presence. People need to wake up!! What is everyone talking about!?! Seeing dark knight's stock rise the way it has... I ve got to interject.<br /><br />No Way. I'm pretty sure I saw what appeared to be a very cumbersome movie. Christopher Nolan really struggled with this one. The structure of the story was poorly derived. He had no handle on the momentum of the film. Right from the beginning with the first scene it felt like the drama was unfolding on a hot air balloon for some reason. It was unengaging and sporadically paced. And this problem extended right to the end of the movie. What a mish mash of action scenes, subplots, and story arcs. Directed with such poor direction.<br /><br />And in between all the mumbo jumbo deep sentiment (mostly from Alfred... Get a grip old man) we are entertained with one liners \\"it's not a car\\", and silly action scenes with police marching right into the line of fire like it was 1917 again. Or how about the mammoth cliffhanger ending for bane. I mean, batman goes to the pits of eternal hell trying to compete body blow for body blow With this incomprehensible turtle and all it took was a Shotgun blast to the stomach from catwoman. What a gripping conclusion! Even less satisfying was the twist, that someone else was behind all this. How on earth this Woman, born in prison, became a derivative of complete evilness... We will never quite grasp. And this so in turn really highlights what I'm trying to say. How does a 2.5 hour movie not have time to really make this a believable character twist? Why does this momentous occasion feel so rushed?<br /><br />Every momentous occasion feels so underwhelming, meanwhile we get long drawn out scenes of dialogue between characters that we care littleabout and story arcs that make this film so tedious to watch. I can't even recall when Bruce Wayne finally dons the suit. As a ridiculous example I was watching the latest Rambo film on cable today and I was stunned how well Sylvester Stallone got it right in comparison. 350 people get torn apart in that film but I distinctly remember the moment Rambo awakens from reclusion (on that boat). His veins pop out and his teeth clench POW! What a scene! His back! It was so well weighted... Dark knight rises? When? Oh that's right when he gets his vertebrae shoved back in his spine and does a few push ups.  What was it? He has to feel the pain of being born in prison to climb out. Took him all of 2 minutes in the movie. The pacing is sooo bad. Meanwhile a conversation between two irrelevant characters in the first half of the film would carry on for much longer.<br /><br />The villain was not a strong enough menace and I'm tired of the same one dimensional Pursuit to reign destruction on Gotham city. How many times does Gotham city need to dodge apocalyptic catastrophe? why can't a bunch of well paid writers come up with something more meaningful a third time round. I'm so confused how people don't see how this seemingly lost Wayne character finding his mojo again is not just a rehash from the first movie.<br /><br />Nothing worked for me. But then here you go. Apparently it worked for everyone else.

0316017930|3.0|The other reviews did justice to the overly anecdotal nature of Gladwell's 2008 bestseller, so I'll just make a very fine point regarding education.  In line with his overarching theme and hypothesis that success is due less to intrinsic factors (i.e. personal factors like \\"IQ\\", personality, etc.), and more to extrinsic ones (i.e. environmental factors like family upbringing, sociocultural milieu, chance encounters, etc.), Gladwell talks about how academic success is less obvious than we would otherwise think.  He cites research that divides students into three different groups of Low, Middle, and High SES, and then shows the unexpected: High SES children make academic gains in the summer (as measured by performance on the California Achievement Test), while Low SES children show evidence of regression.  Compare that with the fact that their respective gains throughout the September-June school-year are more or less comparable, and you have a case for arguing that summer vacations, if not purposeful (read: fraught with packed schedules), are counterproductive towards continued improvement in school.  Gladwell then argues for a \\"rice-paddy\\" approach to schooling-- have no fallow year, no time of un-productivity, and be like the Koreans or Japanese, who send their children to school 220+ days a year as opposed to our lesser 180, and you'll see a transformation of the education system.<br /><br />Such whimsical extrapolations are frustratingly common in the book.  For example, there is the argument that learning Asian languages, with the regularity and logic of their counting systems, makes math easier for Asian children to digest, which makes it more interesting to them, which makes them work harder, a virtuous cycle which continues until these children are significantly more math-savvy than their American counterparts; what should be made, then, of Asian-Americans, the vast majority of whom do NOT know their \\"mother tongue\\", who still lead the nation in math proficiency levels?  Or would this then be due to the cultural heritage of \\"hard work = success\\" they have inherited from their parents, as well as the comparative privilege they are born into?  It should be pointed out, though that Gladwell's original argument seems to break down when you consider that in Japanese, you actually have TWO counting systems-- the native Japanese, as well as the Chinese-derived systems, which are used in different circumstances and for different purposes, and whose readings can sometimes both apply to the same word, which complicates things not insignificantly.<br /><br />Gladwell seems to be making the (obvious) point that context is hugely important, and it is interesting here to also note that the context of Japanese schoolchildren, if explored a bit more, would perhaps reveal why they are more likely to attain greater academic achievement.  Consider the lower birthrate in Japan and what that means for the attention the Japanese schoolchildren receive.  The number of Japanese women who stay at home and consider child-rearing (and often of only children) their raison d'etre.  The shrinking population and the Japanese government's realization that this current generation must at all costs be cultivated, lest they turn out to be the likes of the so-called \\"Freeters\\", that population of no-longer adolescent but not yet adult that can't or won't hold a fulltime job, start their own families, and do as the other mainliner Japanese do.  Of course context is important.  But we've always known that, haven't we, and for every one or two details that emerge in Person A's life to set him up for success, there are perhaps hundreds others that we aren't aware of, and so is it not foolhardy to make the sorts of extrapolations that are not uncommonly made in this book?  Morever, for every Person A out there who does capitalize on those helps of parentage or patronage, what about the many other Person Bs who don't, and squander the opportunities held out soliberally to them?<br /><br />The problem of this book is that it oversimplifies things, makes success and failure seem as easily explainable as the sum of factors A + B + C.  For one, failure is far more complicated-- the Irish Potato Famine, for example, didn't just arise from a potato blight-- there was also the exploitative landowning system, GB's leeching of Irish produce during such a crucial time, etc.  In the same way, American children aren't underperforming in math and other academic subjects simply because they have summers off, or because the language of math in English is nonregular and confusing.  There are a host of other factors out there that would take a full library and research team to expound upon-- e.g. American family structures, shifts in the definition of \\"intelligence\\" in this Information Age, competitors for children's time like television watching or Internet use, and so on and so forth.<br /><br />A fun read, though, for some fun anecdotes that you can call to mind while walking here and there.  And it does make you more grateful for those seen and unseen, thanked and unthanked in your life, who were so instrumental in whatever it is that you have accomplished thus far.
B00650SSDU|3.0|If you've seen \\"No Strings Attached\\"  you've seen this movie---the two are so parallel they're not so much like book ends, but one bookend split in two.<br /><br />This one takes place in New York City, and is yet another film that makes what was not so long ago America's version of Hell look as pretty as Paris (think about it, NYC was once the setting for films like \\"Taxi Driver\\").  Here, both characters are on the rebound, which in most movies would have them avoiding relationships.  In this instance they decide to have a sexual relationship without entanglements.  Woody Harrelson plays a humorous gay character, and of course in many ways what the main characters are doing is having a gay relationship, since the idea of pregnancy or any other serious consequences never comes up.  A lot of historic characters had such relationships:  Don Juan comes to mind.  Baron Von Munchausen even flirted with the Queen of The Moon, and turned down the hand of Catherine The Great.  But those were love affairs of men.<br /><br />It's the 21st Century, so  Hollywood has given us two young adults (four if you count \\"No Strings Attached\\") where the man is everything polls tell us women want, yet the woman doesn't want anything more from him than sex.  Well, of course, they fall in love by the end of the film and everything gets messed up, but what can I say?  No spoilers here.<br /><br />Fast moving, at times scenic, quite contemporary (meaning that in the future it will be interesting to watch for it's depiction of our times, flash mobs and the like) and sexy without being erotic, it's no \\"Sex and Lucia\\", not by a long shot.  This is your rainy day movie, or something to pick you up when you haven't the energy to watch something that requires your brain.<br /><br />And yes, the kids look gorgeous nearly naked.
B004SIP9B0|5.0|Great acting, great movie about very recent events. A look into a closed world very few of will ever be in touch with.
B004WGIXX4|2.0|One of the highest rated films of all times is \\"Casablanca\\", a romantic film set in wartime.  As in literature, Romance and all its entanglements and disasters make up a good portion of Hollywood's output.  Yet, when it's paired with comedy, while a few classics are produced (\\"Bringing Up Baby\\" comes to mind) most of the genre is pretty fluffball, rarely earning critical respect even with the passage of time.  \\"No Strings Attached\\" is not going to end up on one of the better lists of All Time Movies.<br /><br />\\"No Strings Attached\\" as the billboards and cover imply, has tried to up the ante with Sex and near nudity, but the film remains nothing more than sweet entertainment, albeit for a more sex-tolerant crowd.  It's a dead ringer for \\"Friends With Benefits\\", at almost every point, and the fact that the leading men in both films, Ashton Kucher in this one and Justin Timberlake in the other, are men who make the heart flutter but get almost no  respect, is just one more parallel.  If you've seen one, you've pretty much seen the other, but if you're in a funk and need diversionary entertainment, yet can't stand the thought of \\"Mama Mia\\"; streaming both films back to back is your corn-syrup-laden box of Mac n Cheese.  Mac n Cheese with real  bacon, because all four of the main actors are simply delightful when spared the antics of the wardrobe department.<br /><br />Oddly enough, with all the nudity and simulated sex, neither film is the least bit erotic.  Your evangelical relatives will never believe you, but what do they know?<br /><br />Basically, the two main characters are introduced at Camp, bump up against each other in College, and finally find themselves in LaLa land as adults; she's finishing med school, and he's an aspiring writer with a famous dad whose shadow he finds diffiicult to escape.  But, he does have that which many new grads won't, these days:  A swank, designer-made house, a BMW, and a job.<br /><br />In any case, she has commitment issues, mother oriented as it turns out,  and thus they agree to be Sex Friends, something which seems to puzzle everyone they know in Los Angeles, but would be so 2011 in San Francisco.  In effect,  they have a relationship a lot of gay men have, with pregnancy not being an issue; lots of sex with no entanglement.<br /><br />Except that they get entangled.  That's not as bad as it would seem:  Seventy years ago such \\"loose\\" women had to be punished, and usually Hollywood killed them, or in some other way wrote them into purgatory by the end of the film.  And it was always the women.  It's still the women. The guys here are exactly what they tell us women want, but these women don't want them.<br /><br />Ah well.  If you keep eating that mac n cheese you're going to die.  If you expect to find deep meaning in Romantic Comedies, well you're still going to die, but from something that pops up while you're distracted.  Just sit back and watch,  it's only entertainment; for serious, thought provoking  content there's always Al Jazeera.
B0062KMDZ2|5.0|A  Jules Verne story a great classic, brought to date for younger generations, great 3D effects. Great cast, a wonderful movie, very entretaining.
B007L6VR12|3.0|If you saw the trailers, waded through the torrent of PR, and had to put your arm up to shield yourself from the never ending buzz generated for this film, you would be forgiven for thinking it was a zany comedy about kids at camp and the adults around them.  Aside from the \\"zany\\" part, you'd be technically correct.  Did you like \\"The Royal Tennenbaums\\" or \\"The Life Aquatic\\"?  If you did, then you're perfectly prepared for what this film has to offer.  If you didn't, then you should think about that before watching this film, because \\"Moonrise Kingdom\\" is a close sibling to the other two, a trio of painfully shy, slow moving, detail obsessed movies;  It's funny, in parts, but it's a chuckle not a guffaw.<br /><br /> For almost as long as Hollywood has been associated with movies, Hollywood has had a thing for playing kids as adults, and making their parents out to be childish.  This film takes that premise and makes it pretty much the backbone of the film.  Almost all the kids are more mature acting than any of the adults.  Other than that, it's essentially a story of outsiders among the conformist masses, with love instead of revolution at the center of their co-existence.  (\\"The Addams Family\\" did much the same, but did it better).  It's a story that could be told in the present tense, but they decided to use the sixties and did well enough by it.  Yet, for me, the film didn't deliver..  I liked the \\"Royal Tennenbaums\\", and \\"The Life Aquatic\\", but \\"Moonrise Kingdom\\" didn't seem to make its story interesting enough to make me want to care about the characters.  The title didn't help, \\"Moonrise Kingdom\\" suggests much more fantasy than the film offered.  Certainly the buzz was overdone, and affected my experience.<br /><br />Fortunately, you can watch the DVD for a lot less money, without all the in-theater commercials, and you may well find it amusing.  It's not a bad film by any measure, I just don't think it''s nearly as good as the Media  insisted.

1936608898|5.0|Let me begin by giving a little background on me.  In January of 2010, I discovered the Whole30 thanks to one of my clients.  I was over 200 pounds overweight, depressed, and feeling lost.  My client took me to one of the Whole9's seminars and I cleaned out my pantry as soon as I got home.  My partner and I embarked on our health journey together, and I am proud to say that we lost a combined total of over 50 lbs in just 75 days.  Going from highly processed gamer food to eating whole foods was a bit of shock to both of our bodies.  I didn't think I was going to make it, but in a little over two weeks, I was sleeping (I've been an insomniac surviving on 5 hours of sleep for the majority of my life), had mental clarity, feeling better in general, and, the amount of energy I had was something I'd never experienced before.  Needless to say,  it is over a year-and-a-half later, and I am still on board with a paleo diet.  Since then, I have lost 80 pounds and kept it off effortlessly.  I am still going, and, I can't wait to see where my health journey takes me.<br /><br />Bearing all of that in mind, \\"It Starts With Food\\" gave me an even better understanding of the Whole30.  I have attended two of the Hartwig's seminars and learned/absorbed more each time.  After reading this book, I feel even more confident in my knowledge about the Whole30, and how foods affect my body and mind.  My favorite part of what I read was learned all of the psychological effects that food has on you.  This has science to back it up, yes, but a lot of it is common sense in my opinion.  We all know that highly processed supernormally flavored foods are bad for us, but now I really know why.  I urge you to read this book, even if you decide the Whole30 program is not for you.  Knowledge is power, and I can't thank Whole9 enough for giving me the information I needed to change my life.
B007SGM084|5.0|I loved these three books.  I hope that she continues on the story lines thier are other stories to be told....I can't wait to read the next books she writes....I love the story line and how everything turns out...shows you life isn't easy and you have to really work at life.....Loved the books....  :)
B0002F6BQU|5.0|In elf, Will Farrell is a full sized human who is obviously out of place among the elves at the North Pole. Buddy is raised as the son of an elf and when he is grown, he leaves the North Pole in search of his real father. When Buddy finds him in the big city, he is humorously out of place there too. His attributes and talents as an elf are oddities in the more cynical world of humans. Elf is entertaining and is a delightful \\"fish out of water\\" movie for the holidays.
034580404X|1.0|Terrible writing style, too many repetitions of the same words or characteristics, i.e. when she hits on a word she likes, she can't write it often enough (postcoitus afterglow).  How boring can it get.  As for the sex/porn scences, eroticism which is much sexier than the raw act, would have been nicer but maybe harder to write about. In summary the worst of Mills and Boons with sex added.
6302765536|5.0|In Home Alone 2, Kevin gets out of the house and accidentally takes a solo trip to New York. Resourceful as usual, Kevin lives it up at the Plaza Hotel. On a busy street in New York, he runs into the same bad guys that had misguidedly come to his house in Chicago. The thieving duo recognize Kevin and vice versa. Tim Curry at the hotel begins to get suspicious about the youngster being alone. How long can Kevin keep his vacation on the upswing with so many challenges?

B003Y5H5HO|2.0|The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, 2011 film<br /><br />The movie begins with a telephone call about a package in the mail. Then the credits roll with music and graphics. A journalist lost a libel suit. [Sloppy research?] Mikal smokes cigarettes [another flaw?] We see Salander the investigator for a businessman who does her research on the Internet. Lisbeth reports on Mikal. Blomkvist gets a telephone call from a lawyer representing Henrik Vanger, who wants to see him at Hedestad. He would research contemptible people - Vanger's family. Can he also solve the disappearance of Harriet Vanger from forty years ago? Vanger offers him proof of Wennerström's guilt. Mikal will write Vanger's biography, and learns about his relatives living on this island. There are some silent scenes.<br /><br />There is a notebook with 5-digit telephone numbers. Salander is questioned about her work (she has a legal guardian because of her past). She must keep a budget and receipts. Mikal visits a couple for dinner and talks about the past. Elsewhere a thief in the subway tries to steal Lisbeth's bag. Cecilia talks to Mikal about the family. Lisbeth answers questions about her personal life - its regulations. She gets a check after this interview. Mikal flies to London to see Anita and talk about Harriet. Lisbeth visits her guardian at his home. She gets a surprise! [These scenes will not be shown on TV.] Vanger offers to support the `Millenium' magazine. [Do you know how many magazines operate like this?] Mikal looks at old photos. Lisbeth bought a stun gun (are they legal there?). She gets her revenge and a free hand from her lawyer-guardian. Is she insane?<br /><br />Mikal finds something in those old negatives. A chance comment sends him to read Leviticus and its punishment for sinners. Mikal wants a background investigation and meets Lisbeth at her place. He wants help in finding a killer of women. She agrees and does her research. Mikal meets the Vanger family. Lisbeth tells Mikal ofher solution to the murders. Is the dead cat a threat? Mikal talks to a widow about her old pictures. Someone takes a shot at Mikal when he is outside. Lisbeth comforts Mikal that night. Mikal wants to inspect old company records, Lisbeth also helps. [Why does a business keep old paper records?] Mikal talks to an old man. Lisbeth correlates a schedule to the murders. [The silent scenes are hard to follow.]<br /><br />Mikal interviews Martin, and is lead to a basement room! The conversation reveals the guilty man, who talks freely about his crimes. Lisbeth arrives just in time to save Mikal. She chases the fleeing murderer who crashes his car. The leaking gasoline explodes, the driver is burned alive (like some medieval punishment). Lisbeth tells her past to Mikal. Martin denied killing Harriet; could she still be alive? They visit Anita in London, who tells them about her past. The mystery is solved, Harriet returns to speak to Henrik Vanger. Lisbeth tells Mikal the secrets of Wennerström's past; this time the charges will stick. Lisbeth borrows 50,000 for her work. She will repay it as she has the passwords to transfer funds from Wennerström's banking accounts. Wennerström is now a hunted man without the money to buy his way out. He is bumped off by his former business associates. Lisbeth returns to her past.<br /><br />This film toned down the original story and improved the character of Lisbeth. It has repulsive characters and some X-rated scenes. This story echoes \\"The Big Sleep\\", \\"Chinatown\\", and \\"Roseanna\\". Can you believe a serial killer living in an isolated location? Most serial killers seek areas with a large transient population for victims. It warns about the Internet (was it designed to allow governmental agencies and others to access your computer?).

B000089A06|3.0|Red Dragon, 2002 film<br /><br />The movie begins in a symphony hall in 1980 Baltimore. The camera shows one man in the audience. Later Hannibal hosts a dinner. What did he serve his guests? Special Agent William Graham visits him for advice on a profile (missing body parts used in cooking). There is a sudden attack! But the defense succeeds. The newspapers tell of the events. Hannibal received nine life sentences. [An argument for the death penalty.] Graham quits the Bureau. A few years later he gets a visit about the massacre of two families during a full moon. Can he save a few lives? [The taxicab dates this movie.] He inspects the crime scene at night and makes comments into a recorder. Mirrors were smashed. Talcum powder for rubber gloves. Bite marks can identify the killer. What is the connection between these families?<br /><br />Graham talks to Crawford. Can he get advice? He asks Hannibal for his opinion. \\"Just like old times.\\" Hannibal has ideas and comments. Graham takes another look at the houses. We see an old house and its occupant. He has a scrapbook. Will talks to Hannibal again. Hannibal uses \\"social engineering\\" to get an address. Francis buys infrared film. He gives a ride to a young woman. They found a note in Hannibal's cell! The FBI analyzes the note. It's a book code with a home address! Will's wife practices pistol shooting. They plant a story in the press to get a reaction from the perpetrator. [Standard operating procedure?] It gets a reaction. That reporter gets a surprise! Will he tell the truth? His newspaper gets a delivery. The FBI gets a recording. But this leaves clues to the crime. Graham returns to talk to Hannibal. Can he get closer to the murderer? They offer a deal.<br /><br />A tiger needs dental work. An interesting and mysterious man? He watches home movies. Recognize the family? Who does he talk to? [Do these scenes seem too crazy?] \\"Get out now!\\" A visit to the Brooklyn Museum? Good taste? There is a clue in the video tapes. They visit that business. One name matches the profile. Reba is scared. Francis says its all over. \\"I can't do it.\\" The clock sounds. There is a burning house that explodes for a dramatic ending. There was a scrapbook in his safe. \\"Its so sad.\\" A telephone call has a shocking surprise! [Just when you thought it was all over!] There is a final burst of action to terminate this story. [The ending shows how a weapon can protect your home against intruders.]<br /><br />The first movie version of Thomas Harris' novel was called \\"Manhunter\\". This is a good story but seems a little overlong. If you saw the first version there won't be many surprises. That is the problem when you make a copy of a successful movie even if there are minor changes. Its best to make major changes while following the basic plot. I wonder when they will use a \\"social network\\" as the link between victims? You may like this story better if you never saw the first version.
0553801473|3.0|The first three books of \\"Game of Thrones\\" were wonderful, compelling, addictive reads.  Unfortunately, the momentum they've built up is now being lost, as the saga is now drifting into a lethargy and is quickly becoming \\"As the World Turns\\" of the fantasy genre.  There are over a thousand pages, but little ground has been covered.<br /><br />Seven books (and now it looks like it'll be eight) are a lot of books to devote to petty family squabbles and power plays, and Martin's promise of dark and sinister forces have yet to materialize.

B007N6NGYG|2.0|Bought this for use on my Android smartphone.  Thought it would help to while away some time.

B0085Z8F4A|5.0|I attended the opening night of Prometheus at an IMAX 3D theater. The movie will undoubtedly receive Academy Award nominations in all categories. The IMAX 3D presentation was the finest use of IMAX 3D technology that I have ever experienced. The 3D was so excellent that it was literally like sitting in the middle of the action! The filmmakers know how to manipulate 3D and make it look good! I get a tingling sensation even thinking about it! That is why I pre-ordered Prometheus in the Blu-ray 3D/ Blu-ray/ DVD/ Digital Copy version without hesitation. This will become a treasured work of timeless cinematic art in my movie collection.<br /><br />Beyond the existential components of this film, Prometheus is a true prequel that fully explains the Alien Anthology (also out in Blu-ray and part of my collection). You will understand how it all began, and if you view the 2003 alternate endings for the films up to the finale, Alien Resurrection (the final movie of the Alien saga) replaced with a \\"feel good ending\\" in theaters, you will understand WHY that ultimate ending was inevitable. Although the Alien saga is a dark journey into the depths of hell, so to speak -- in essence an anthology of humanity's evolution through extinction and rebirth into a new quasi-human species over the course of centuries -- it is existentially worth the dark journey. How would YOU like to have acid for blood?<br /><br />I found many epiphanies about this universe and our existence as its intelligent observers. Perhaps parallel universes are God's proving grounds for intelligent life to decide if they truly want the burden and anguish of becoming \\"like\\" God, \\"knowing good and bad\\"? Atheists, theists and agnostics will each find a different interpretation, no doubt, because it is debatable as to the true implications of Prometheus and the Alien movies that chronologically follow.<br /><br />However, theists will find solace in the unstoppable faith of Dr. Shaw. Perhaps one epiphany and take awayfrom Prometheus is life may exist beyond this tiny blue planet -- the ancient holy texts may be allegories and not literal. Dr. Shaw believed God still exists and shall receive her beyond the great veil of reality when her temporal life ends. When her tests are over, however long that takes, God will deliver her from this great void. Atheists can pay no mind to these implications because Prometheus offers plenty of grist for the mill to argue that Shaw's faith is noble at best. That is the beauty of this film. Prometheus challenges both sides to think carefully about any preconceived fanciful illusions about God's existence as allegorically taught by the Church, or as dogmatically denied by hardcore nihilists.

B0037RDPEG|5.0|Books are AMAZING.  What you get out of reading them is so diverse, uniquely individual and delightfully surprising at times.  And you can read the same book again, only to discover an over-looked nugget that could just transform your life forever!<br /><br />I'm reading \\"EAT, PRAY, LOVE\\" (yes, late adopter, that's me!) and getting so many different lessons from it, it's mind-blowing.<br /><br />Liz Gilbert must have known of this wise aphorism - Sell them what they want, but give them what they need.<br /><br />Packaged into a seemingly light story about a divorced lady roaming Rome, imbibing India and blitzing Bali are some of the deepest messages about living, happiness and purpose I've ever seen in a novel-travelogue.<br /><br />If she'd tried to present this same material in more serious fashion, it would have been a heavy drag to read.  Somehow the author manages to slip in those powerful insights along a narrative that's oh-so-easy to read and enjoy - without even realizing, on a conscious level, how it will make you think and feel later!  Genius writing talent there.<br /><br />And the book speaks directly to the hearts and minds of middle-aged women (and men, too?) going through that turbulent phase of life when you're wondering what it's all about.  I can't see many 25+ year-old readers putting it down mid-way.<br /><br />All too often, an author struggles to stuff a point of view down a reader's throat.  Not this one.  There's a \\"take it, or leave it\\" tone to the message, which makes it all the more effective.<br /><br />Speckled with self-deprecating humor, Liz daringly reveals stark personal feelings and shares deep empathy with her intended audience, as she worms her way into your heart through her writing - and as we all know, that's when it's easy to gently share a message that'll get past our intellectual barriers to reach and touch our hearts.<br /><br />It's probably why it spent 187 weeks on the NY Times best-seller list and sold 10 million copies!<br /><br />I'm barely two-thirds of the way through it, and glad I didn't stop reading after the first few chapters seemed to confirm the couple of negative reviews that, for some strange reason, Amazon.com seems to enjoy proudly displaying AHEAD of other glowing testimonials!s!<br /><br />I'm barely two-thirds of the way through it, and glad I didn't stop reading after the first few chapters seemed to confirm the couple of negative reviews that, for some strange reason, Amazon.com seems to enjoy proudly displaying AHEAD of other glowing testimonials!

B005EM8O8O|4.0|Robert Harris, the writer of The Ghost, has produced yet another thoroughly entertaining work, but one laced with a thread of anxiety.<br /><br />It's surprising how someone who apparently spent his entire career as a journalist and writer has managed to capture the atmospherics of modern-day financial trading.  And in the manner of Tom Wolfe, Harris has taken real-life events and real people and thrown them into a sort of fictionalizing cuisinart to produce a riveting tale that touches (lightly and with a chuckle) on some of the major issues of the day: e.g., Evolution, Global Conspiracy and Finance.<br /><br />The structure of the story is premised on the Flash Crash of several years ago, when the Dow Jones suddenly dropped nearly a thousand points in about a minute, in a &#34;Flash&#34;.<br /><br />But Harris, of course, is having one on a bit.<br /><br />The premise has the following contours.  The regular Joes and Josephines (?) of the world react with FEAR when confronted with the accelerating potential of Man-Made technology, Man-Made social policies and Man-Made conflicts to destroy… Man… and Woman… and Children… and, basically, everybody.  The Fear Index, the financial algorithm at the heart of the plot-theme of this story, exploits precisely that irrational quality.  The fears spawned in the endless stream of imminent apocalypses advertised in the boldface headlines of Flipboard and Pulse on the issues of the Perpetual War, Climate Change and Food Insecurity provide the algorithm with an opening.  A subtle imbalance arises in the collective unconscious that the algorithm exploits like a Hapkido master.  And so, there we go, tumbling through the air towards our silly and somewhat embarrassing demise.  The algo goes short everything, but then u-turns to buy it all up at the bottom.<br /><br />The fall is painful. Recovery is far from guaranteed.<br /><br />Taking this entertainment seriously for a moment, the implication of course is that panic is worse than techno-disaster.  The Fear Index is simply the tool that we have used to destroy ourselves.  Harris seemingly whispers that cold British calculus would have been preferable to our ancient mammalian and somewhat plebeian tendency to wring our hands and sweat bullets at the prospect of… Y2K, pole shift, aliens, 2012, Mayan Prophecy, Bilderberg and the second shooter from the grassy knoll in Dallas.<br /><br />Remain calm.  Help is on the way.  All we have to fear is fear itself.  Forget this nonsense about conspiracy and the possibility of baroque and hidden powers.<br /><br />But what if there are real risks embedded in our technologies?  What if our confidence in the future really is mis-placed?  What if our fears—especially if they are collective—are indeed an early warning that what is amiss now is simply the start of an accelerating and very slippery slope?<br /><br />It's possible then that the Fear Index algorithm wins either way, whether quickly with our help or over the long haul… all on its own, propelled only by a hidden force.<br /><br />After a few sips of wine, one comes away with the conspiratorial thought that conceiving of Man as fearful cattle is both possible and very, very effective.  So is this then how our friends at the Rand Corporation conceive of us?  (Of course, if there were something like a Fear Index algorithm, they will have written a memorandum or white paper on the topic already at Rand or Tavistock or the Max Planck Institute.)  Social Engineering is apparently possible now with a granularity and precision that was fanciful a century ago.  If I were a conspirator and social tinkerer I would, I think, very much prefer to be left alone, to tinker as I please.<br /><br />I can well appreciate that from Harris' position as a member of the Royal Society of Literary Arts that the problems at the core of Fear Index may seem like little baubles and play things.  So what that we are at the threshold of new technologies that will once again split man apart, aristocrats on one side, peasants on the other, technocrats over here and the great unwashed over there… as far away as possible?<br /><br />The world will become TIDY once more.  Why be afraid?  Sounds like fun with Doomsday, because for someone out there one can be sure that Doom is just another word for Victory.<br /><br />Fear Index closes with the sort of pyrotechnics that we are used to now from Dan Brown and his stories.  The technology that threatened to eat us alive is...uh... dealt with adequately. (No spoiler there.  We all knew where it was going to end.)  All is well again, sort of.<br /><br />But I am afraid that all is not well again.  In case you have forgotten, George Orwell and Aldous Huxley also wrote tales about the victory of technology.  We are NEARER now.  The Fear Index is far more entertaining than either 1984 or Brave New World, and that ironically might be a somewhat frightening observation.  I very much enjoyed reading this book.  The unease came to me very much later.d the great unwashed over there… as far away as possible?    The world will become TIDY once more.  Why be afraid?

B000SCHBGQ|5.0|The first book in a good series about a modern spin on ancient magic, with recognizable characters who have really lived. Highly recommend picking up and beginning this series. A fast read that keeps your attention at all times.
B006WAIUEK|1.0|I read Trainspotting but admittedly was a bit younger. However I find Skagboys virtually unreadable because of overuse of dialect.  Read about 50 pages and had to stop because of a splitting headache.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I absolutely loved this series, the first book you get to know the characters and is just so shocking. I loved the first as the intro. Yes it's very simplistic writing but let's be honest, when reading a book like this you want it straight to the point and easy to get through. This was recommended to me by 4+ people and I'm so glad I gave in to Mr. Grey ;)

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I began reading this book out of curiosity. I'm in chapter 2 and I have to delete it. The writing is so pathetic, I swear this is the first draft and was never edited. If E.J. is a true writer, then I must be an astronaut!!!! I've never been in space, and I doubt she's ever been in a writing course. If this is a \\"Best Seller\\", then it goes to show you you don't need to be a good writer to sell books. It's sad when trash like this gets into the book stores. It really brings down the quality of writing many \\"true\\" authors strive to achieve.<br /><br />Not only is the writing quality atrocious, the scenes are too unbelieving and too stereo-typical. Does she have any imagination at all? There are a lot of quality books out there yet to be read by you. Pick one of those and leave this trilogy for when you run out of toilet paper.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|This is one of the most poorly written books I have ever read.  I don't understand the fascination that others have with the series.  Monotomous monologues, repetitive phrases included.  I got bored about half way through the book.  I wonder whether the author has a teenage daughter, because this is the age range I think it was written for.  It's hard to believe this twenty something girl in the story is still a virgin and falls under this man's \\"spell\\" I've read better erotic literature, and if you need more of that, google erotic literature and you will find better writing for women in those places.  I personally have never been a submissive person in any relationship, but I find it hard to believe that Ana, who appears initially as a strong independed woman agrees to this relationship to begin with.  Wish I could return this and get my money back.

B005GUQYIQ|1.0|5 Stars for the book! The Kindle edition is barely readable.<br /><br />I fail to understand why Amazon believes its customers are too stupid to hold the Kindle Landscape for a book that is published landscape. Instead it has taken these drawings and minimized them to large, fuzzy postage stamps. If I am going to pay a couple of dollars short of the full price I want a book as good as the hard-copy. Glad I opted on the side of caution and bought just ONE of the set. Amazon you lost selling me the rest of the set!
B001E2JNA6|5.0|The five star reviews before me have well expressed what an excellent production<br />this series is.  With the extra added bonus of 1080p, what more could a person want,<br />though it is sad that the audio couldn't have been upgraded to at least Dolby Digital.<br />Among the British period series, this one rates at the top of my list!  TWO THUMBS UP!!
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|This game is typical for its type except that there are many more levels to play. It gets repetitive but that is just the kind of game it is.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game! I can not show my little sisters. they will be begging me. But I won't delete it caus I love it.
0547569653|4.0|I have used and enjoyed many of the recipies from this book.  The book is a little less fun story to read and more of a how to on life.  I highlighted many parts.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I use this app on my kindle fire for bible study and devotionals. I didn't know bible study could be so easy. All the different translations make for a great in depth study. And it's FREE!!!!
B0060FXDCG|5.0|Great movies and product shipped in good time. These movies are highly recommended for anyone who likes action movies with some comedy added.
0316113077|4.0|A great book overall. The tutorials are fantastic and the step-by-step instructions in the basic recipes are easy to follow. I also like that ingredients are listed by weight, and eggs are listed in both quantities of each or cups. I am only giving this four stars though, because my version (perhaps it's been updated since my purchase) has a rather glaring typo. On all the cake recipes listed, it says to bake 9\\" rounds for an hour! Someone unfamiliar with baking may not know that is way too long for a cake that size. It looks like it has been corrected in the Confetti Cakes for Kids book though. Just be careful on those baking times and check your cakes or cupcakes often if you are uncertain.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Looks great is simple but ads are distracting. Would be much better with out ads. Is there a paid version?

B001P9EQH8|5.0|i purchased the fiio e5 amplifier with a set of audio-technica m50s headphones and have been very happy with the sound from that combination.  the e5 produces a noticable difference in the sound, especially when hooked up to a cell phone.  through my laptop i don't notice as much.  the amplifier is the size of a current ipod nano and comes with the wires needed to hook it up to a phone or other device.  for the additional few bucks i would definitely recommend it if you have a good set of headphones.

B00498XRPE|5.0|C'mon!  What else can I see. It started a whole new way of filming, story-telling, creativity.  Just awesome. Just incredible how the special effects and robots they made for this movie. Nothing but a good time.  (and yes.. there's a slow pace to it... but if you like and know about Sci-fi a lot of the movies are slow-paced).
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I couldn't put the book down, the story was captivating and it held me to the end of the trilogy and left me wanting more.<br />I almost felt a bit empty having to move on knowing there would never be anything more of Ana and Christians story...so I read it again. I am currently reading the trilogy for the 3rd time. But I still wish there could be more stories of Ana and Christian Grey.
1401235166|5.0|Well over a hundred issues and FABLES is still going strong. FABLES Vol. 17: INHERIT THE WIND collects issues #108-113, as the creative team of Bill Willingham, Mark Buckingham, and Steve Leialoha, those merchants of literary addiction, keeps feeding the fiends. This trade forks over four story arcs, two of which are prominent, the other two not so much. After the epic (but sort of anti-climactic) Mister Dark saga, Willingham grants us one of those periodic breathers. That's not to say that crucial events don't take place. Things of import transpire like a mother.<br /><br />With Bigby Wolf's father having sacrified himself in a death duel against the frightening Mister Dark, there is immediate, desperate need to fill the void he'd left as the North Wind, one of the four eminent Cardinal Winds. The only worthy candidates are Bigby and Snow White's six (but, really, seven) cub children. In the remote keep of the mountain king, the anxious parents can only look on as the former North Wind's servants impose a series of tests and trials on their little darlings to determine who is the true heir. Complications abound when the three other Cardinal Winds appear, having sworn to sink all efforts to appoint a new North Wind from the old bloodline.<br /><br />I tend to walk around grinning all day whenever the mischievous wolf cubs are showcased. I find Bigby and Snow's family to be utterly charming and irresistible. Willingham lays down some terrific character beats for the kids. I love that we get a peek into the cubs' personalities, particularly that of Ambrose, Dare, and Winter. And then there's that worrisome prophecy which foretells the cubs' individual fates or, for a few, their dooms.<br /><br />We also catch up to Bufkin, de-winged blue monkey and renowned hero of the Business Office, as he's back in the land of Oz and has enlisted in a modest rebellion against the tyrannical new Emperor of Oz. As someone who has read all of Baum's Oz novels, it's pretty gratifying to see the Sawhorse and Jack Pumpkinhead involved as Bufkin's co-conspirators, even if they tend to be on the skittish side.<br /><br />Elsewhere and concurrently, the exiles of Fabletown tentatively return to upstate New York and the rural comforts of the Farm, just in time for the holidays and for Rose Red, that newest paladin of hope, to be visited by three spirits. Meanwhile, the vengeful and sorcerously slimmed-down Mrs. Spratt continues her evolution as a villainous key player. Except that, really, there's not much forward momentum to her storyline.<br /><br />Issue #113 goes the anthology route as Willingham and a series of artists tell several short stories concerning \\"In Those Days.\\" In these four brief narratives we learn, among other things, why it was that the Adversary deigned to ignore Fabletown for as long as he did. There is also a turtle on which shell lies a kingdom contained in a ceramic teacup. And there's a horny porcupine.<br /><br />Rich in character moments, narrated with flair, enveloped in sly humor, and steeped in years of complex continuity, FABLES keeps on being one of the best - if not THE best - comic book currently going. Even though this volume sets a more leisurely pace and the stories this time out aren't staged on a grand scale, I'm still gleefully flipping the pages. When will Bill Willingham run out of ideas? Does his deal with the Devil come with an expiration date? Here's hoping not. We've just had the lull. We're ready for the big, epic stuff again. 5 out of 5 stars for this one. I can't give it anything less, given that Bigby, Snow, and the cubs are featured significantly.o see the Sawhorse and Jack Pumpkinhead involved as Bufkin's co-conspirators, even if they tend to be on the skittish side.<br /><br />Elsewhere and concurrently, the exiles of Fabletown tentatively return to upstate New York and the rural comforts of the Farm, just in time for the holidays and for Rose Red, that newest paladin of hope, to be visited by three spirits.

0743277708|4.0|You don't really need me to tell you. The eight hundred or so glowing reviews on this page (just so far) are at testament to the quality and beauty of this book. But if you're really reading this review without knowing anything about the book, here's a brief summary.<br /><br />The novel follows the tale of Hazel the rabbit and his various companions as they narrowly escape dangers in an attempt to establish their own warren (think of it as a rabbit community). It's tempting to interpret the trials that the rabbits face as if they are allegorical (there are spiritual themes, as well as lessons about unnatural behavior, helping those in need, and seeking peace before war), but in the preface Adams explicitly states that he meant nothing by the book other than to tell a story about rabbits. Although immersing one's self into the world of the rabbits -- including their habits and language (Lapine) -- takes a tiny bit of getting used to, once you are there, it's absorbing and real.<br /><br />Adams' prose is astounding and the characters are vibrant and distinct. For a book with such a large cast, rarely is it hard to distinguish one rabbit from another, and the conversations, actions, and obstacles that occur are imagined and related with stunning clarity. Obviously a naturalist, Adams demonstrates a keen eye for wilderness details. The pages seem to burst with the color, smells, and sounds of a world of wild animals.<br /><br />Others describe the book as flawless, but I wouldn't go that far. In spite of their evocative beauty, Adams' descriptions of the hills, rivers, and foliage are overdone at points. I wouldn't be surprised if the book contained, by name, every single native plant that could be found in the section of England where the action occurs. Although that level of detail is admirable, it is also distracting (I've never heard of most of these plants and even after reading the book couldn't tell you what they look like) and occasionally stabs at the pace of the novel.<br /><br />That brings me to my second minor quibble with the book. Although Adams has a craftsman's eye for detail and beauty, this works against him on a few of the novel's climactic moments. The action sequences seemed disjointed and clunky to me, especially since they relied so heavily on dialogue and -- again -- Adams' extensive use of detail. Ironically, there were points where he spent a paragraph or two describing a bridge or punt, and I still had difficulty picturing them in my head. It's a case of forest versus trees. Although Adams clearly knows he has a poet's ear for prose, he seems -- in just a few places -- not to realize that sometimes too many words can confuse rather than clarify.<br /><br />These are small issues (oh, and I didn't care for the constant epigraphs, either; they add literally nothing to the story, and after a time, I just stopped reading them) in what is otherwise an astounding book, which I would gladly recommend to everyone I know, young or old, jaded or no.the novel.<br /><br />That brings me to my second minor quibble with the book.

0061122416|3.0|\\"I believe I can create whatever I want to create...We are who we choose to be,\\" (Will Smith).  Will Smith is reflecting on Paul Coelho's The Alchemist.  When he spoke about his philosophy with the book, I was eager to read it.  Like the narrator in this book, the young sheppard, human beings have a personal legend that paves their way through life.  It took me a longer duration then expected to appreciate the tale that took place in the book.  The ironic component about that is: Finding the outcome of our own \\"personal legend\\" can seem just as redundant at times.  The answer to our quest is simpler that one would think.  The young Sheppard endured various tribulations, such as departing with his lifelong stock and being deceived by trusted individuals.  I will not tell you how he found the answer to his personal legend, but I will say that it was right in front of him the whole time.  At 25, I have a lot to learn about life.  The more I live it though, just like the Sheppard, I will glean valuable information to fulfill my personal legend.
0395389496|5.0|Simply stunning illustration. Beautifully quiet book. Highly recommended for children and parents. My child loves this book although doesn't believe in Santa Claus.
0439023513|3.0|Let me first explain why i chose the title of the review. This book examines closely the role of propaganda in war. On both sides. How they attempt to sway the public opinion, or strike fear into enemies or unite a dispirited population. This particular aspect of 'Mockingjay' itself sets it apart in my eyes and deserves praise for the attempt at handling it. The other salient feature is how the return of a particular character is dealt with and how it affects Katniss.<br /><br />*****SPOILERS BELOW*****<br /><br />Peeta's interaction with everyone after his arrival is handled nicely and humanely. This along with the propaganda angle of the book makes it worth reading.<br /><br />*****SPOILERS END*****<br /><br />But then, you realise that it's the job of any author to manipulate the reader into feeling certain emotions and to play on those through the course of the story. Collins did that brilliantly in the first book by the horrors Katniss witnessed in the Games and the author carried it forward into the 2nd book adequately. Interspersed throughout the book are moral sermons about the horrors of war and the need for unity and forgiveness. If it weren't for the earlier two books, I would have shut the book right then but I wanted to indulge the author for the two books preceding this one. However, it always irks me when the lead character of any book begins to preach because it is just never handled well.<br /><br />What Collins also fails to do here is provide a compelling ride to the business end of the series. The money-shot if you will. The entire 2nd half or last third of the book seems completely random. Of course, I imagine that in no war is there a straight path to victory. Many die for pointless reasons and this book seems to mirror that. Random characters seem to be killed off on a questionable mission culminating in a death that strives so hard to repeat the sorrow felt by ...<br /><br />*****BOOK 1 SPOILERS BELOW*****<br /><br />Rue's death and Katniss'eulogy of the little girl<br /><br />*****BOOK 1 SPOILERS END*****<br /><br />But it didn't even make me blink.<br /><br />I suspect that Collins had the image of this scene in her mind when she devised the finale to the series but to me it felt so fake that it shook me out of the suspension-of-belief induced by the series. It is like when a comedian is trying too hard to make people laugh and you can see that in his face or hear it in his voice. When authors spend pages detailing a scene in the pretense of 'world-building'. I didn't expect this of Collins based on the previous two books and hence the harsh review. But if you have read the previous two books and liked them, you will be buying this one anyway.<br /><br />But overall, if I were to give the series a score, it would be 4 stars. It concentrated on the plot throughout the three books and managed to finish a series of this size in a trilogy which is much more than can be said for other authors who string along their readers for years.  It gave us two engaging characters in Katniss and Peeta and wove some good ideas like the propaganda machine into its story.
B0073XV2W2|5.0|It's 5:30am and I just finished. Unable to sleep because fe story was so captivating (minus the short bodice ripper scene in the middle). Suarez has done it again. If you liked Daemon, or Zero Day, the  youre going to like this terrifying novel. The action is fast paced and detailed, a perfect story for the silver screen and definitely for your Kindle.<br /><br />Daemkn nd and Freedom tm left me inspired, Kill Decision  left me afraid and paranoid.
0439023491|4.0|After the relentless emotional upheaval caused by 'The Hunger Games', 'Catching Fire' is significantly slower. The first three quarters of the book are juggling various topics and to Collins' credit, she doesn't attempt to pad the number of pages (or books like other authors do) with 'more explanation'. However, the book does suffer a bit from a slight lack of focus on any one thing, but the one that is given the most pages to, is the love-triangle between Katniss, Peeta and Gale.<br /><br />It isn't treated as mushy-mushy 'who-must-I-choose' nonsense, but you can tell that effort was put into making it intertwine with the plot as logically as possible. However, Collins also to deal with the aftermath of the previous novel, the mood in the districts and the Capitol's response.<br /><br />This book was a hard one to score for me, because while it isn't as engaging as 'The Hunger Games', it isn't as plot-hole ridden as 'Mockingjay' (the 3rd novel) is. But I still give it 4 stars because of some of the genuinely heart-tugging moments, one being the Victors' trip to District 11.<br /><br />Now I can't review the last part of the book without giving out some spoilers (major or minor, you decide). So here goes,<br /><br />*****SPOILERS BELOW*****<br /><br />The new Games (yes, there's another round of Hunger Games with a twist) are very different to the previous one and Collins has truly attempted to keep things fresh this time around. It is rather short, but I think that was intended in the plot as well. The apprehension felt about every other tribute (whether temporary ally or permanent foe) is still felt in this incarnation. The resolution feels a bit rushed and hurried but ...<br /><br />*****SPOILERS END*****<br /><br />It's to Collins' credit that she does resolve this particular book at the end. There are no senseless cliffhangers and since the next book is the last, you know the issues brought up at the end will be resolved in the next book.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|One of the most addicting &amp; enjoyable games I've ever played. I would definitely recoment it to anyone I know.
0439023521|4.0|What I really like about this book is how the author states everything in a matter-of-fact way. There are no long passages aimed at describing every square inch of a scene, there are no characters droning on and on about their motives except the lead character of course. In effect, there is no pretentious 'world-building', no trace of a pseudo-dark atmosphere that seems to have permeated into every form of fictional medium these days. Don't get me wrong, this is a serious book and far from light-hearted, but there are no delusions of grandeur on the author's part trying to conceal a weak plot.<br /><br />The author stays on top of the plot throughout the book and once I got through the first page, I couldn't stop. It compelled me to finish the trilogy in a matter of days and Katniss and Peeta are wonderfully fleshed out (in this particular book).<br /><br />It isn't perfect though. The part of the book leading upto the finale is fairly slow (but the middle is amazingly intense), the Capitol and its population are not very well detailed in the sense that it is hard not to just cast them as debauched freaks and lastly, Katniss gets to escape from quite a few crucial decisions during the Games themselves although this seems to be counter-balanced by decisions she takes towards the end of the book.<br /><br />It definitely is worth reading and take my advice and start reading this on a Friday evening. Or else have an excuse ready for your boss or your professor or your teacher for the next day ;)
0307454568|5.0|This is the third book of a triligy written by Stieg Larsson. It took a little longer to get into the story plot but like the rest of his books you couldn't put it down until you finished it. Great story, too bad this triligy is his only books. Great writer.

0345803485|1.0|All you hear is how addicting these books are. It was all over TV and talk shows. I got through the first book painfully and as I was reading, I thought this is what has people so fired up?  I can tell you that I won't be reading the rest. I kept thinking that if my daughter read this book and thought that is how a man should treat a woman, how sad. I agree with one woman on Dr. Oz who said it followed signs of domestic violence. It is so unrealistic that it made me laugh at times but hey, all the hype made the author rich.
B0028MBKVG|4.0|This book has been recommended for several years by friends and family.  I had my style of running and they had theirs.  Unfortunately, I got injured.  I relented and read \\"Born to Run\\".  While reading this through recovery I was excited to turn the page and find out about Caballo and where he came from along with a anthropological review (through anecdote) of running and how shoes may contribute to injuries like what I suffered.  I have not been able to follow the \\"barefoot\\" style fully but have made modifications to my running style with pointers suggested in the book.  I have noticed a increased, but sustainable, pace while not having any recurring injury.  I have also noticed less pain in joints.  I don't believe any book is the end-all-be-all but \\"Born to Run\\" points a person in the right direction an provides some science to back it up as well as history.  This is a good read for a refresher and first time runner.

0307472841|5.0|This is the first book I've read by Mankell, but it certainly won't be the last. It was just superb. Mankell clearly is a past master at building suspense and at using language to create imagery. How he combined old grudges and the bleakness of a Nordic winter was captivating. I bought this book about a year ago but didn't get around to reading it until last week. Before I read it, I read several of the reviews by others. I found it interesting that the major criticism of the negative reviewers was the weaving of the author's politics into the book. Apparently, these readers like to be spoon fed pablum. The politics of the characters is integral to the story. It is beyond me how anybody could object to the characters having political views. At any rate, there is enough drivel out there for them to read. I'll stick with this master.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|This film is amazing.  Christian Bale should win an Oscar for his astonishing performance as Batman.  Anne Hathaway was the best Catwoman so far and Tom Hardy was the best vilan I have ever seen since Darth Vader.<br /><br />The movie does start off slow, but it builds itself up to the epic fight between Batman and Bane (Tom Hardy).  I love the way Bane intimidates you while astonishing you.<br /><br />This movie should be fine for children 12 and up.  The film has a very dark tone.  Bane breaks peoples necks with his hands which is often on screen.  Near the end the film turns from scary to sad which might be too much for younger children.<br /><br />Don't be discouraged from seeing this movie because of the shooting at the midnight screening in Colorado.  I have sympathy for the families who lost their loved ones indeed, but don't let that moron who killed those innocent people destroy it for you.<br /><br />The Dark Knight Rises is epic so please go and see it, it is worth every cent that you pay to go and see it.  Trust me, you'll agree.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Just downloaded this game, no problems at all downloading. I just completed mission 1, got all 60 gnomes, and mission 2 did unlock. Game didn't crash, freeze, there were no problems at all with this game, it works just fine on the Kindle Fire. I like this game, and would recommend it to a friend.
0345803485|1.0|I bought the first two books thinking I would absolutely need the 2nd right away as so many people hyped this trilogy up.  I found the story line of innocence cute.  I chuckled a few times about the list of rules, thinking of it as role playing.  Aside from that, I found the book incredibly redundant in not only the story but grammatically as well.  I wish the author would have used other adjectives to start.<br /><br />The internet calls this book \\"mommy porn\\" and that is exactly what it is.  If you have a completely vanilla and boring life, I can see why the concept of this book and the pitiful BDSM display would get women going.<br /><br />It does not do a subculture such as BDSM any justice whatsoever, and I would venture to guess that people who are part of a Dom/sub culture would find this book revolting.  I can't even force myself to read the second book; it was all I could do to get through the first one.<br /><br />Honestly, do not waste your time reading this book.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is awesome!!  in the begining it starts off easy, hut as you go it gets harder. the creators of this game has done a fabulous job!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|great game can not wait to see the movie fun for hours and hours and hours. keep up the updates for thi game.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I thought it was going to be an interesting read, but it was so much more! It was also a murder mystery that was well written. It left me wanting more, and I hope the author writes a sequel.
B0042H6VY6|5.0|\\"Ultimate Pet Shop Boys\\" by the Pet Shop Boys is a fascinating organized set highlighting some of the hits that represent their sound. My two personal favorites from this compilation are \\"Miracles\\" and \\"Together\\".  At the time of this writing, I have not yet seen the \\"Miracles\\" video but intend to do so. However, I have seen the \\"Together\\" video and feel that it fits perfectly with the song.  \\"West End Girls\\",\\"It's A Sin\\", \\"What Have I Done to Deserve This\\", \\"Always On My Mind\\", \\"Heart\\", \\"Se A Vida E (That's The Way Life Is)\\" and \\"Love Etc\\" are some of the catchy musical tracks on this cd. \\"Ultimate Pet Shop Boys\\" by the Pet Shop Boys is a great selection for those who enjoy electronica, synth pop, and/or candid love songs.
B005KDWUFA|5.0|As usual, Il Divo delivered!  After seeing them on TV about six years ago, I immediately went on line and purchased their first CD. Have all of their CDs now and can't wait for the next one. Beautiful! The perfect blend of their voices is mesmerizing. Certainly doesn't hurt that they are so gorgeous either.
B000002B30|5.0|\\"Greatest Hits\\" by Bruce Springsteen is an impeccable compilation showcasing his raw talent and intense emotion.  \\"Hungry Heart\\", \\"Dancing In the Dark\\",\\"Born In the USA\\",\\"Glory Days\\",\\"Brilliant Disguise\\", \\"Human Touch\\", and \\"Secret Garden\\" are some of the classics that define this collection. \\"Greatest Hits\\" by Bruce Springsteen is best for those who enjoy classic rock and music with an emotional heart.
B003UPPO2G|5.0|This is a must have for any fan.  The sound is great.  Show it on a large enough Flat Screen with surround sound and you feel as if you are at a concert.
B004EPYZSK|5.0|This product arrived exactly like the movie with nothing cut out of it such as deleted scenes and was exactly as advertised.
B008MEM24S|5.0|This game is awesome I love it, I got tired of where's my water cause I beat it and then I got the upgrade for it and then I got &quot;Where's my Perry&quot; so know I have two things to play!!!!!!!

B004LWZWGK|5.0|From his beginning to his fall, The Dark Knight must rise again! After taking Harvey Dent's fall and disappearing without a trace, we all thought it would be all over. But now, it's a few years later and crime has started to build once again. And now it has seem to grown to a level where nobody can hold. Now a new, mysterious masked man known only as \\"Bane\\" has appeared and began to terrorize Gotham into the highest level imaginable. But after deserting the one man who can save them from all of this carnage, what will Gotham be able to do now?
B0000VAFO0|5.0|Underworld is a great movie. I love their clothes and how the people turn into wolfs. Don't remember what they are called in the movie. This movie is so awesome. I can't wait to watch the second movie.
B000F6IOC0|5.0|Oops hubby and I went from the first Underworld to the third Underworld. And this whole time I thought we had the first two movies. Well I think Underworld: Evolution is an awesome movie. Just like the first Underworld. I really enjoy this movie. I hope to order the second and fourth Underworld soon from Amazon so hubby and I can enjoy it just as much as we enjoy the first and third movie.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its an awesome app... u should get it.. u would get a lot of fun apps in those game....  :)
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is just hard enough to keep you thinking and sometimes truly stumped and now I would like to take the time to talk directly to bubble fish who wrote a truly false review yes the last level is easy but finish all the levels and get back to me &gt;:(
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I began playing this out of boredom and found that I began to enjoy it. My adult daughter also plays it with me. She does all the arranging of the village and I just click to make more coins and get more friends. We both purchase items but plan it out a bit. Nice diversionary game to while away some free time.
B00846REIS|2.0|This book has been very difficult to read. It jumps all over the place.  I would not recommend this book. But I have enjoyed buying my books from amazon.
B008220AVW|5.0|Even though I love Katy Perry's music, I didn't expect to love her movie.  There's a big difference between enjoying a five minute song and watching a two-hour movie.  I only saw the movie because my two daughters wanted to see it.<br /><br />As it turns out, I really loved the movie.  Viewers get a unique glimpse not only into Katy's current pop star lifestyle and concert tour madness, but also into her struggle to get a music label in the first place as well as her efforts to hold together a failing marriage.<br /><br />But the reason I really ended up loving this movie is because Katy the person (not Katy the pop star) really appears to be genuinely sweet and likeable.  I loved seeing her interact with her siblings, her friends, her fans, her evangelist parents, and even her adorable grandmother.  Katy's \\"realness\\" really touched my heart . . . and even watered my eyes more than once.<br /><br />This is a touching movie about a charming girl!
B004HAG40O|5.0|This is currently my favorite collection of songs, and I've been playing it essentially nonstop for about ten days.  I get in the car, \\"Don't Carry It All\\" comes on instantly, and I'm good to go until the whole CD is over, and then I just start it over.  There are layers of beauty here that seem new every time I hear them.  I know a lot of people think this is a step in the wrong direction from the earlier stuff, but this is the first Decemberists album I've really loved, and I love practically ever note of it.
B004UID2LC|1.0|but it has said it is installing on my kindle for week or more. and I cant get rid of it.
B00003CXAA|4.0|The Godfather saga (at least parts I and II) are classics. I won't go on too much about the movies themselves in this review. However, I should mention that Coppola has come out with [[ASIN:B0018CMJSU The Godfather: The Coppola Restoration]], which cleans up the movies and has more bonus features. I'd recommend getting that one instead of this collection.
1609613937|5.0|The Starch Solution is one of the most important books in my library. Dr. John McDougall and his wife Mary, who is a nurse and celebrated chef, have produced a gutsy, non-preachy work that debunks the claims of the beware-of-carbs brahmins, as it invites you to enjoy the pleasures of consuming plant-based comfort foods. This awesome writing team reveals how populations throughout the world throughout time have thrived on diets rich in potatoes, corn, rice, wheat, beans and other starch staples. Concerns about protein and calcium are addressed, and 100 zesty recipes for burgers, soups, stews, sauces and even chocolate brownies are included. You have nothing to lose by reading this book and eating the delicious foods, with the exception of unwanted pounds.
B005LAIH4A|3.0|There's a lot going for this Lorax movie. The effects beautifully mimic Dr. Suess' artwork. The voice acting really captures the Lorax. The changes to the plot generally fit the spirit of the original story - with a major exception I'll discuss later. In all, there's a lot going for the Lorax and casual viewers should enjoy it.<br /><br />However, for fans of Dr. Suess' original book, the end result comes across as overly Hollywoodized. The movie imposes a meta-narrative on the original plot in which we learn more about the boy who seeks the Onceler's advice. Much of the meta-narrative works, although I think it does trivialize the environmental message. The boy now goes to seek the Onceler's advice because a girl he has a crush on wants to know more about trees. Even worse, the film has a typical happy ending, which again trivializes the book's environmentalist theme. The book's ambiguous ending leaves the reader concerned about the fate of the environment, whereas the movie allows viewers to forget about the trees once they leave the theater.<br /><br />With so much going for this movie, it's a shame Hollywood chose the easy way out. This movie could have worked really well if it had ended the same way as in the book. In fact, I'd recommend watching it and pausing it right after the scene when the boy passes by the \\"UNLESS\\" stone marker.
B00846REIS|1.0|I read this to try and fill my 50 shades void... DON'T DO IT. NO COMPARISON- DIDN'T EVEN FINISH IT
B005LAIH3G|3.0|First of all, I agree with the majority of reviewers in that John Carter is nowhere as bad as many \\"professional\\" film critics alleged. Disney seemed to denigrate its own movie before it even came out. It's a shame it did, because John Carter is worth viewing if you like sci-fi/fantasy.<br /><br />I also give the filmmakers a lot of credit for keeping the story on Mars, as in the original Edgar Rice Burroughs book, and not changing it to another planet. The Martian landscape as a background works really well and makes for some beautiful imagery.<br /><br />That said, the plot is a bit convoluted. There's a lot of talk about a 9th ray and aliens changing history, but it seems largely inconsequential next to the more traditional and immediate plot of the hero recruiting natives to save the princess. John Carter himself is imprisoned about half a dozen times, each time for a few seconds or so, which ruins the tension and suspense of each imprisonment.<br /><br />The film also suffers from uneven pacing. Some parts move very quickly, while at other times my attention started to wander. Some of the highlights - including the stadium fight with the White Apes featured in much of the promotional material - end up being very short, whereas John Carter's initial leaps on Mars seemed to go on forever. I could see this being a much more popular film if Disney decides to do a special edition re-edit (which is unlikely, unfortunately).<br /><br />Overall, it's a pretty fun film, but flawed in some important ways. Worth renting once, but probably not worth buying.<br /><br />(Oh, and Lynn Collins as the Martian Princess Dejah is absolutely smoking and perfect in the role!)
B00846REIS|5.0|I thought it was way better than 50 shades even if it was similar I just wish the second one was already out!
0345803485|1.0|Is it possible to rate something with less than 1 star?<br />I am disgusted that so many people are enthralled with this book. This is nothing but pure trash. Our country is in a very sad place when people can read a book like this and not be shocked. Further, people are actually romanced by Christian Gray. I hope that my daughter never comes across someone like this in her life or if she does, she will RUN AWAY because Christian Gray is a psycho. I read this book because someone in my book club selected it. We have a rule we are to read every book which is the only reason why i purchased it. Don't get sucked into this
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|From the moment I started reading Beautiful Disaster I just could not put it down. I was completely enthralled. Admittedly, I did find some grammer and spelling errors but that takes nothing away from the book for me. I'd also like to point out that even though there was some 'unnecessary' violence and it seemed like they have a very 'unhealthy' relationship I feel like it was a realistic book and I liked that about it. I liked how there were a few different things going on throughout the book like the fighting, the whole thing with Abby's dad and the gambling among other things. It kept me interested. Also, I enjoyed that it was pretty long and took me more then a day to read. I've already told my friends that they MUST read this book. I really enjoyed Beautiful Disaster and think it's a definite must read!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I love it I think it would good if u wanted to wake up but not by your parent's and if u are lazy this will wake u up
B001AQO3QA|4.0|I love these movies- particularly Alien and Aliens (1 and 2, respectively).  I own several blu-ray boxed sets and the thing that really caught my attention about this particular product is quality of the packaging.  The movies come in an attractive and well built cardboard book.
B00881VLCE|4.0|nice standard puzzle. Don't see how its magical but it is a nice game and the settings are clear and simple.

B005IQZB14|5.0|A great book! Cheryl had a lot of courage and determination. A once in a lifetime experiance. If only I had that much fortitude!
B007IQX1G4|2.0|I hate to be another critic piling on, but my wife and I just suffered through this movie.  We spent $4.99 to rent the HD version, and the way I figure it, Amazon owes me about $4 back.  On the plus side, this is a movie that has fine performances (not great) and...I like the Mini Cooper she drives.<br /><br />Okay, that's about all the positive I can generate.  The movie is a study of Theron's character, but it's a two dimensional, unsympathetic character who has no arc.  She's unlikable throughout and only comes to discover she's shallow and pathetic, without leading to any resolution.  My wife and I kept waiting for this movie to get good, until the credits started rolling and we realized we were out of luck.  I expect Ivan Reitmann is usually an excellent director for lighter fare, but this is a dark movie that ends up being irredeemable.  Please, don't waste your time.  And if you would like to refund us $4, just let me know.
B001GKJ2E8|5.0|Wanted is a great movie. The special effects are awesome. I think Angelina looks beautiful and I am totally loving her tattoos in the movie. Specially the one on her palm.
031265068X|3.0|If you can wade thru the details of metal trading and then oil trading ad nauseum, and are really fascinated by this, you might enjoy this book.  The first half of the book is pretty well written and kind of interesting regarding Rich's life escaping the Nazis, his travels with his family, and his being introduced thru working in the mail room of his father's company to the commodity trading world.  Obviously, the guy was a hidden genius which his father recognized early and started him on his journey to fame, riches, and infamy (sort of). An amazing facility for languages was also a boon to Rich's progress as a world commodity trader.  Because I met Rich in Southwest High School in Kansas City, I was really fascinated with what ensued with this rather shy introvert teenager who showed a talent for analyzing a teenage girl who was a virtual stranger to him.  Obviously he used this ability to build a world empire.  The story of Rich's life morphed, however, into really tedious details of his business life of oil trading and the intricacies thereof.  The author's writing thus deteriorated into boring redundancy.  Guess I was more interested in Rich himself rather than his rather Robinhood type life using his extreme wealth for philanthopic causes.  Ugh, oil trading is not my thing.
B000E8QVWY|5.0|I am not a country song fan. But I do like the song Walk The Line. I heard it on a Lifetime movie called Baster out of Carolina. I didn't know who song Walk The Line till this movie came out. After hearing about this movie I was excited to see it. Now I am an owner of the dvd and I am happy. This is a good movie.
B006PTL1QM|3.0|Essentially this is a movie about Jung and the significant relationships in his life - with his forerunner and contemporary in psychoanalysis, Freud, with his rich and patient wife, and perhaps most of all with the patient with whom he falls in love and has an affair, Sabina Spielrein.  It's hard to see the Cronenberg of old who would delve into murkiness and come up with visually inventive and often shocking ideas.. here, the photography is bright and crisp, the mannerisms impeccable and the period seemingly immaculately recreated.  The pace is measured, and in the manner of the time, \\"violent arguments\\" are mere words on paper, so much of what was said being done by letter.  Indeed, it is through the letters of Freud and Jung so much is known about them, apparently.  So it's a biography, covering the pivotal career trajectory of Jung.  And yet for all the willingness to show things for how they were (Knightley has a brave and deliberate performance, which was apparently well researched, as the detail rich commentary by Cronenberg attests), is less emotionally involving, and more.. well, clinical, if you'll forgive the analogy.  The details are interesting and well observed, the history of the two men in particular is of some significance, and yet for all the fine performances it is hard to truly be engaged emotionally.  Fassbender has a wonderful performance as Jung, finding out about himself as much as about his patients at times, and Mortensen is really wonderfully understated as he puffs his pipe, and wrestles with his opinion of the man he had hoped would carry his work forward.  Their interplay during their period of friendship is arguably the movies highlight, as they ponder each others dreams..\\"Have you considered the rolling log could be your penis..?\\".  Knightley has done a great job in a difficult role, having to convince as someone seriously mentally ill at the start, but who went on to become a significant psychoanalyst in her own right.  Alas, her Russian accent, while not awful, leaves you forever reminded she is acting, when everyone else speaks perfectly normally.  It's defensible from a movie convention point of view, but distracts.<br />Taken on its own, without any preconceptions, this is a well crafted and visually beautifully conceived movie.  It's just hard sometimes to forget that with Cronenberg we so often expect something with more bite.  Without that bite,  what we are left with is a biopic that educates a little, engages somewhat less, but is so beautifully shot and acted, it's like a Merchant Ivory film with added rude words.  6/10
B008MEM24S|5.0|Creative without differing too much from the original. The bonus levels weren't all that great but getting balloony in the game was a nice touch.

B003102JDM|5.0|I am dumbfounded by some of the one and two star reviews for what I believe to be one of the Coen's best films. This modern-day Job story is funny, moving, and pretty profound. The main character's struggle to come to terms with his life as it spirals out of control is intriguing. Michael Stuhlbarg is fantastic in a career-defining performance. And the fun the Coen's poke at Judaism, parenthood, and life in general is witty and beautifully rendered. While the film is not zany (like Raising Arizona) or violent (like Fargo), it stands with their best work by providing real insight into the human condition, with all its joy, pain, and unpredictability.
0679882820|4.0|This book was pretty good. Maybe it is because we have lots of animal books, or maybe it was the small size but this did not make it as a favorite in our house. Although my son did enjoy this book from 12 months - 15 months- hence 4 stars.

B007NZQU72|4.0|I'm writing this review motivated by the negative reviews I read. I think this book has been misunderstood. Like I said in the title it's about self acceptance. I don't know how it's been marketed because I figured I was a highly sensitive person myself and I looked for material to read about it in order to educate myself and not to find help (I don't need help). I think some people went for this book looking for a '10 step cure for over sensitiveness' and got disappointed. First of all THERE IS NOTHING WRONG with highly sensitive people. We are just different, what makes me happy is what makes ME happy not what makes YOU or HIM or HER or my mother, my father, my boyfriend happy. That's something this book as helped me accept and understand. Just because we don't conform to the society's rule doesn't mean there is something wrong with us and that's the biggest problem an introvert or a highly sensitive person have. I advocate to think of highly sensitive people as we all should think of people with special needs or example. THERE IS NOTHING WRONG TO BE FIXED we are just different. Like Elaine mentions in the book, highly sensitive people have many traits that can be useful to society. We are just misunderstood and mistreated which leads us to believe there is something to be fixed, which makes us go look for the idealistic '10 step' book. Those books by the way, when it comes to personal problems, hardly ever work. That's because individuals are that, individuals we are all different and have to learn who we are and learn to deal with ourselves.<br />This book is very insightful and has helped me see that there are other people out there who are like me, that I'm not the freak society makes me, that I don't need professional help because there is nothing wrong with me. It explains what a highly sensitive person is, how it's different than being an introvert or just shy and why we are that way. Some people might be sensitive in other ways and have not identified withthis. We are a minority after all. I think this book does society a great service just by helping us highly sensitive to understand ourselves and be able to function to our full potential.<br />I just didn't give it a five star because the writing could indeed use some help, a few typos here and there but overall it's easy to understand.
0756405890|5.0|The first chapter sucked me in.  My eyes grew wide, I chuckled and shook my head. I knew I was in the hands of a master storyteller.<br /><br />Have read #1 and #2 in this series.<br /><br />Am waiting as patiently as I must for The Doors of Stone ... Kingkiller #3.
B000IHY146|1.0|karen had a voice that sounded like a cross between kermit the frog from the muppets and that dude from canned heat. painful to listen. i wish i could honor her memory by sayin her album sounded awesome~but her voice was so grating that i have to call out the \\"sacred cow\\".
B005HSG3TC|3.0|As soon as I purchased new item, I discovered there are used same items or better (leather) that were less in cost. It still serves the purpose however. Good product to protect your tablet.
B003OJBWGK|4.0|Best Coast maybe in danger of losing their coveted reputation as the only group successfuly managing to translate; soppy pining, weed smoking, half baked lyricism into genuinely powerful art. Their latest album The Only Place suffered an indie backlash early this year and it's got a few people retrospectively thinking Crazy For You wasn't as effortlessy charming as they gave it credit for it 2010. Despite how retrograde this sounds, i can see why some may highlight the unexceptional elements of this album as being somehow more important in 2012. With the band seemingly unable to build on what they achieved here with follow up The Only Place, there's a strong impulse to throw the baby out with the bathwater.<br /><br />I'm proud to announce i'm still a Best Coaster though, as i'm in love with this amazing album perhaps even more now that im having to defend it's Neo slacker genius to a slew of haters and turncoats. I slightly jest about the extent of my ardency towards Crazy For You, but i do still really enjoy listening to this and for good reasons to. Bethany Costentino's voice is so sweet and honest on here not to mention pitch perfect. Her lyrics are as endearing as they are simple. The rhyming couplets lazy/crazy, prettier/skinnier and low/go have irked some who find them embarrasingly primitive but i just find them open hearted and lacking in pretension.<br /><br />The music on Crazy For You perfectly complements Costentino's voice to. Emphasising a more lo fi garage pop sound opposed to the overproduced sheen of The Only Place. The catchiness of all of these songs on here make it hard to pick favourites but \\"I Want you\\" finds a wonderful balance between Phil Spector's wall of sound pop and The Ramones early punk. And the scrappiness of \\"Bratty B\\"  and the Nirvanaesque distortion in \\"Goodbye\\" make Bethany sound like the most loveable 21st century Riot Grrl. Music this great should never be relegated to the guilty pleasure spot in anyones album collection, so i'm going to blast this a little louder in my flat from now on.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I love this game so much. I can't  stop  playing  it. It never crash on me but this is so fun

B004IG8WPM|5.0|The product is in excellent condition, picture was clear. This is a great family movie to watch on the weekend when you have nothing to do, however, I could watch this movie any time of the week because this movie do not have sex scenes in it, today too many movies are filled with sex and it takes away from the movie itself; Adventure in Babysitting is a movie for children of all ages to enjoy from 6 to 60 years old and you do not have to say close your eyes or turn your head. I recommend this movie to all who want to see a good movie without being overpowered with sex scenes.

B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|I love the first two albums, and I was not pleased with the ones after the first two. This is a return to their old formula in some ways. This is coming from a guy who stopped buying their albums after the third one. Support this album because it is really good..
B002WJI66C|5.0|I have a small collection of Mario characters and I must say this has been the best toy I've purchased so far. He is just the right size and very adorable. His big tounge was also a plus, especialy since you can hide it in his mouth. I would deffiently recommend this toy to any Mario collector.

B007L3BMGA|1.0|I don't understand how this got so popular. The writing is pedestrian at best, the characters don't make sense, and I haven't even gotten to the \\"juicy\\" bits.<br />This book alone illustrates the inherent problem with ebooks- if they suck you can't give them away.<br />I can't see myself finishing it and I can't inflict it on anyone else.
B008CJ0JTI|5.0|Remember years back sitting down with someone watching this movie and thinking... damn what an amazing movie? I Do! Yes everybody, it's back, but this time we can actually listen to the glass shattering into pieces as Mike D. is falling from the sky.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|Poorly written, poor inner dialogue.  Not worth the hype. The most interesting character is the Ms 'Jones' character.  Mix pretty woman with Twilight and mix in crappy writing and you get this fluff that you have to pay extra for in three books. Glad I waited  to read wished I had my money back.

B00000DUE7|5.0|This is a fantastic box.  It comprises the ten volumes (11 CDs in all) of Vivaldi's complete sacred music recorded by The King's Consort between 1994 and 2003.  The music itself is fabulous; in my view it is in these works especially that Vivaldi's greatness shines most brightly.  It has wonderful variety from the beautiful and solemn to the joyfully vigorous, and Vivaldi's gift for melody and harmonic creativity runs through every piece.<br /><br />The performances are unfailingly excellent.  The discs are littered with star soloists - James Bowman, Robin Blaze, Catherine Denley, Michael George, Sarah Connolly, Joyce Didonato... the list goes on and on and they give the excellent performances one would expect.  The instrumentalists and chorus are equally good and the whole thing is beautifully judged, with real weight and gravitas when needed and a delightful suppleness and spring in the step for the livelier parts.<br /><br />As with any large set, there will be parts which you like more than others (I've never been crazy about Juditha Triumphans, for example) and, like me, you may already have favourite versions of some of these works.  These certainly won't depose people like Emma Kirkby and Andreas Scholl in my affections but they are top quality performances and there is also stuff here which I've never come across elsewhere, all of it excellent, and you simply can't go wrong with this box.<br /><br />In short this is a magnificent set.  It is quite an investment, but it will give you a lifetime of pleasure and I recommend it very warmly.

B002QEXBGS|5.0|This production is one of three Offenbach operettas that Minkowski has conducted. All have been notable for great energy and attention to detail.<br /><br />Orpheus in the Underworld is, of course, a version of the Greek tragedy that is anything but tragic. Fundamentally it is a send-up of the original story where both Orpheus and Eurydice have grown tired of each other for various reasons and their amorous attention has been caught elsewhere. In addition to this, both Jupiter and Pluto are determined to gain Eurydice for themselves. Eventually everyone ends up in Hell which, far from being a place of torture is a place of constant partying. This is where Eurydice would prefer to remain and Orpheus too would be happier with this solution so no sorrow, except that expressed by the character of 'Public Opinion' is expressed and the whole story ends with general jubilation.<br /><br />The whole cast of this sparkling and sacrilegious production enter fully into the spirit and the racy pace is maintained throughout. The leading parts of Orpheus, Eurydice, Jupiter and Pluto are both sung and acted with great energy and musical skill and as if they were individually born for the parts they take. Dessay has a wonderful time singing effortlessly while engaging in all sorts of non-musical activities. The same can be said especially for Laurent Naouri as Jupiter. One could really go on and list all the cast but I will content myself with simply including the dancers and the choreography for constantly uplifting work in every sense! Very imaginative.<br /><br />The orchestral contribution under their conductor is played with total commitment, considerable verve and plenty of enthusiasm.<br /><br />The settings and costumes could be described as bizarre and this is where it all becomes a matter of personal taste. They are sufficiently extreme to cause pleasure, or somewhat less likely, irritation, for those with firm views. My own view is that the whole thing is supposed to be a send-up so sending up the setting is probably appropriate so long as the musical values are not compromised and crucially, this performance delivers enormously well on the music.<br /><br />So a strong recommendation from me with just a small element of caution. If you are a strong traditionalist you may not be so keen! In my opinion though, this one is an out and out winner and well worth the full 5 stars.a send-up so sending up the setting is probably appropriate so long as the musical values are not compromised and crucially, this performance delivers enormously well on the music.<br /><br />So a strong recommendation from me with just a small element of caution.

B000817YF0|5.0|I can only imagine how difficult it must be to create an album with such imagery without lyrics, Godspeed pull's this off and then some. the jet black labels leaves your wondering what your about to listen to, this leaves your with a feeling uncertainty and anticipation. no matter witch side the needle drop on first your pulled in. True it is not the most musically talented album in the world but it is this albums simplicity that makes is so captivating and beautiful. (I'll say that for any Goodspeed album) The loops and builds this album delivers along with the chilling monologue's leaves your wanting more in a good way, You will not be unfulfilled. This is one of those albums that is meant to be listened to on vinyl and nothing else.

B007SGM084|4.0|This was a fast, fun summer read...pure entertainment and maybe a little educational. Seriously, great literature it is not, but I still recommend it.  Intriguing plot with some interesting twists just when it appears to be predictable. Have fun!
030758836X|2.0|Does the ending of this book leave you a) wishing you hadn't read it  in the first place; b) asking, \\"where's the resolution?\\" c) feeling thoroughly unsatisfied; or d) all of the above. Answer: d<br /><br /> Think of a life experience you've had that started great only to bomb out at the end. Like a promising date that was going really well--only to be ruined by a nasty argument at the end of the evening. You go to bed feeling empty, unfulfilled. That's what reading this novel was like for me. Starts great, quickly becomes a can't-put-it-down page turner, then completely fizzles at the end, leaving you unsatisfied with the novel's lack of resolution.<br /><br /> That said, I agree with most of the positive comments about the book: \\"Fiendishly clever,\\" \\"Totally engrossing,\\" Gripping and addictive.\\" \\"Well-plotted,\\" etc. Does Gillian Flynn have excellent writing chops? Does she masterfully develop psychologically complex, multidimensional characters? Present penetrating insights into the nature of modern marriage and relationships? Write pitch-perfect dialog? Absolutely. She just needs to learn how to finish. Develop resolution.<br /><br /> One thing Flynn might want to learn to use to her advantage in future novels is the \\"recency effect,\\" which simply states that the last thing you see or experience in a given situation or event is more accessible in your memory, and therefore more likely to be remembered by you then those things that occurred in the beginning or middle of the experience. Given the novel's lack of resolution and totally unsatisfying ending, the last thing I remember about the book is my feeling of utter disappointment.
B0067R0APK|5.0|worth having. no problems. have used it for over two years and could not be happier. try it and you will be sold on it.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I wish I'd read more of the 1 and 2 star reviews instead of simply relying on the best seller list.  This book has no satisfactory ending. It's infuriating. I could argue about other parts of it being illogical, derivative, cliched and more but in spite of everything, it held my interest.  Until the last page.  I, too, would have thrown it against the wall if it weren't on my Kindle.  Horrible non-ending. It's as if she just got tired and stopped writing.  Do NOT buy this book.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I went searching for this and was thrilled when I saw I could get it on my new android tablet.

It is great to be able to take my Bible on my light weight tablet.

Sometimes you get weak signals and it shows just how weak or strong a signal your getting. I like knowing that information.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Fun game. Most of the levels are easy to challenging, especially to get all the gnomes (which are like stars in Cut The Rope or ducks in the Where's My Water).There are some hard levels as well, but not enough to make the game frustrating. The minimal story frame and dialogue (which parodies the secret agent genre) was funny. Overall, is enjoyable and I can't wait for more levels.

0316098337|5.0|I don't want to give anything away about this book.  Just read it.  When you grasp the daily, unwavering strength of the mother, you won't be able to put it down.  The p.o.v. is unforgiving and completely understandable.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I slog my way through a lot of books looking for a good original story without breaking the bank, and this one fills the bill!  Especially hard with science fiction, it's usually either too much science and not enough fiction, or too much fantasy.  Always a good sign when you read a story at every opportunity, like I did with this one.  Had to get Part 6 immediately, and already bought two other Hugh Howey books to read on vacation.  Thank you!

1416955070|3.0|The city of Bones was good in its own way, but I think the author tried a little too hard to make her sentences longer. Authors do this so there are more pages in their book, but the problem with that is that the reader isn't as well engaged and so I found myself struggling to finish the book. Her sentences are like run-ons in a way, for example, \\"They were dancing, or what passed for it-a lot of swaying back and forth with occasional lunges toward the floor as if one of them had dropped a contact lens-in a space between a group of teenage boys in metallic corsets, and a young Asian couple who were making out passionately, their colored hair extensions tangled together like vines\\". (Pg. 4 Paperback edition)<br />Another thing I observed while reading the book, is that, I don't know if anyone else saw it, but I think that as she was writing the book her ideas seemed to fade in and out of the important stuff and there were things she had forgotten later in the book that she explained differently in the first part. If that confused you than...Those were the times when I was confused, like, \\"I thought she explained that couldn't happen and yet it did\\".<br />The good things were, even in third-person, I could get to know the characters in a way first-person can't portray them. There was good character development for a first novel sort of thing. Cassandra Clare put in action when the things grew boring and she had a firm plot. I also liked the addition of all the downworlder creatures. I like vampires and werewolves.<br /><br />*SPOILERS*<br />Now for the spoilers.<br />Simon was a little correct when he said Clary was stupid for not seeing that he was trying to make her jealous of Isabelle. As you got further into the book you could see his admiration of her. It's not as fun a book when things are obvious.<br />That was also with Alec. You could probably guess he was gay from the things he said like \\"But I like you\\", and \\"I agree with you\\".<br />The thing that had me reeling with disgust was when Clary and Jace fell in love and then at the end Valentine said he was their father. Brother and Sister kissing in the Greenhouse. I'm not sure I like that but I did finish the other books which I will not proclaim what happens<br />*END OF SPOILERS*<br /><br />This book, I recommend, for readers that like fighting and action with swords and knives, teeth and claws, and an awesome stele. Those whole like paranormal creatures and demons.<br />This is not for someone with a light stomach and doesn't like blood. There is a lot of throat slashing, stabbing, and more blood. And for those who don't like swearing, there is hell, bastard, bitch, crap, damn, and probably others hidden in there.<br /><br />This is a book a lot of people enjoy and everyone should read it.
B004LWZWGA|4.0|Well, here's what I'm going to say at the outset: this isn't a perfect film. It has a few flaws and a few plot elements that don't make much sense. But while it isn't a perfect film, it is, in fact, a perfect ending to the Chris Nolan Batman film series.<br /><br />The movie also does an excellent job of avoiding the three film problem that many super-hero film series seem to have. I'm thinking of works of \\"art\\" like X-Men 3, Superman III, Spider-Man 3 and, of course, Batman Forever.<br /><br />The movie shows us a version of Bruce Wayne who has holed up in his mansion, unseen by the public. Life in Gotham has moved on, and Harvey Dent is held up as a paragon of virtue to the people of Gotham (something that greatly troubles Commissioner Gordon). Aside from a cat burglar named Selina Kyle, all appears to be reasonably well.<br /><br />And then Bane arrives.<br /><br />What to say about Bane? His master plan is...well, something I can't reveal here, as it would really spoil things. It makes sense for him, his past and his character, at least as established in the movie. What follows once his plan starts is a series of crushing defeats for Batman, the city of Gotham under siege and a great many twists and turns that I didn't even remotely expect. I also didn't expect that the movie is really more of a sequel to Batman Begins than to The Dark Knight.<br /><br />Tom Hardy gives an excellent performance as the man with the plan. Also excellent are the returning cast of Christian Bale, Michael Cain and Morgan Freeman, as well as newcomers to the series Joseph Gordon-Leavitt and Marion Cotillard. Nolan does his usual excellent job as a director, and despite some minor plot holes, I really did enjoy this film. I wish that I had more to say about it, but it's hard to do so without venturing into spoiler territory. So I will simply say that if you liked the previous movies, you'll probably like this one, and if you didn't, you're not really in the target audience anyhow.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I understand the hype behind this series is the sex, but really, unless you've had a dull sex partner, there isn't a whole lot new in this book.  The sex scenes are the same ol' same ol' regurgitated over and over.  It gets old fast.  And I could get past that if the writing had at least been good, but it isn't.  There are many instances where you feel the author is rushing to get through to the next scene...perhaps she too got bored writing this story.  There were many times I scanned pages to get through to the next chapter because it's the same ol' same ol'.  Then there are the myriad of typo's.  The publisher of this book should be hanging their head in shame.<br /><br />The hype over this book series, (and really, did it need three books to tell this tale?) is over-blown, no pun intended.<br /><br />Save your money, save your brain cells for a book that is worth reading.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Let's get the elephant in the room out of the way first: Heath Ledger's The Joker is a hard act to follow. Impossible, some might even say. Wisely The Dark Knight Rises doesn't try to outdo itself by bringing in a bigger and more colorful villain, for if it had that inevitably would have took it down the road of self-parody (Batman Forever, Batman and Robin anyone?). Nor does it sacrifice character in its rush to get to the next big action set-piece, the Hollywood thinking being that what audiences want from their summer blockbusters is lots of bang for their buck; after all Spider-Man 3 gave us that, and look how well that turned out.<br /><br />Make no mistake though, the scale of The Dark Knight Rises is huge: the plane hijack at the beginning, Batman's first appearance on the streets of Gotham after eight years sees him being chased by what looks like ever cop car in the city. How the film's villain, Bane, spectacularly cuts off Gotham from the outside world and traps all of its cops at the same time. Gotham's finest in blue charging Gotham's scum-of-the-earth for a Gangs of New York-style street rumble.<br /><br />But is all stays grounded, helped in no small part by the fact that Batman is one of comic's and cinema's most accessible superheroes, because he isn't a superhero; at least not in the sense that he has supernatural powers. I pointed this out to my brother when he saw Watchman and he said, \\"But there aren't any superheroes in the movie, apart from Doctor Manhattan. The rest as just vigilantes.\\" \\"Yeah,\\" I said, \\"but so is Batman.\\" You could see him thinking about it, and then the realisation dawning. Oh, Bruce Wayne's got lots of fancy James Bond-style toys to help him out, but in the end he's just a guy in a Halloween costume beating up the bad guys.<br /><br />Which leads me to one of the best sequences in The Dark Knight Rises - Bane and Batman's first fight. Other movie maker's might have gone down the road of staging some big, dump wow encounter,but Christopher Nolan brings it all down to gut level. No music. A strip of metal walkway. And two guys just slugging it out with their bare hands. Or Batman's slugging it out and Bane, for the most part, is allowing him to go at it... and thus clearly sending a message: is that it? Is that all you've got vigilante boy? An expensive costume and some boxing moves? And that's when the audience realises that Batman truly has met his match, and Christopher Nolan didn't need to bring on a big and colourful villain in order to do it: all he had to do was introduce Batman to an essentially ordinary man, but a guy who's just as determined and single-minded in achieving what he feels he has to do as Bruce Wayne is.<br /><br />And what else the movie brilliantly achieves is neatly tying its storyline into the previous two movies, to form a true unified three-part story. In fact, I would say the story development is The Dark Knight Rises' greatest achievement, in terms of how it not only shows the fallout of Harvey Dent's death but deftly weaves back on itself to echo scenes and dialogue from the previous two movies (James Gordon placing his jacket around a young Bruce Wayne's shoulders, the excellent scenes of a fallen Batman in an underground prison where the only escape route is a wide shaft leading to the hope of daylight, like the well Bruce fell down as a child ... \\"Why do we fall, Bruce?...\\"), to bringing in the League of Shadows and Ra's al Ghul. All of which culminates in the movie's brilliant sting in its tail when you discover that Bane isn't really who Batman is up against. And whilst with seeming effortlessness it does all that the movie also manages to bring in Catwoman (although she's never referred to by that name) and pair her with Batman in such a way that not only does it feel natural, but also never makes the character feel like a sidekick. At one point Batman opines to Selina Kyle/Catwoman that she's got more to give, and that's the way I've always felt about Anne Hathaway, that she's not just a chic-flick actress (as her role in Rachel Getting Married showed). She's superb as Selina Kyle/Catwoman.<br /><br />Anne Hathaway's character doesn't distract or steal the show. Indeed no one does, which is another plus in the movie's favour: all the characters contribute equally, all of them serve the story. As I've said, the movie doesn't lack for big action moments, but nor does it lack for emotional moments either. In this sense Alfred, terrifically played by Michael Caine, in many ways embodies the heart of the movie. The moment he tells Bruce that he didn't want him to come back to Gotham, that what he wanted was to go on his annual trip abroad and to sit at a table with a drink and to look up... and see Bruce sitting a few tables away, with a wife and perhaps a kid and to smile and to know that Bruce Wayne had moved on. Or the moment Alfred tells Bruce about Rachel's letter. There are just enough of these moments between various characters to not only pace the movie between its action sequences but to give it emotional weight.<br /><br />Simply put, Christopher Nolan is the best thing to ever happen to the summer blockbuster. Like film critic Mark Kermode pointed out in his superb book `The Good, the Bad and the Multiplex: What's wrong with Modern Movies?' summer blockbusters don't have to be big and dump like a Michael Bay Transformers movie, they can be big and smart and still be hugely successful at the box office, as both The Dark Knight and Inception proved.<br /><br />We all know this isn't the end: Batman is too lucrative a franchise for Warner Bros. to abandon... although pity the poor sod who's eventually tasked with a reboot after Christopher Nolan's trilogy! (And, hey, how amazing would it be if years hence Nolan and the gang got back together and did an adaptation of Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Returns? ... now THAT would be the ultimate summer blockbuster!) But for the moment -<br /><br />The legend ends -<br /><br />- and the quality of the summer blockbuster rises (well, at least until Michael Bay comes along with another Transformers movie and promptly flattens it again!).

B00006D295|3.0|I've been aware of \\"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\\" since about 1980. I remember the date because that's when I got into running and the friend that introduced me was a RHPS fan. He'd go to one of the local art theaters every weekend and take in one or two of the midnight showings. He said the people (in the theater) wore costumes and participated in the lines of the movie and sang along with the songs. He said it was a blast. Ummm, it just didn't sound all that interesting to me, but I once went by the theater as people were waiting to get in and there was a rather hugh crowd of rather strange-looking people standing around. I was amazed. The local paper commented about it and said it had probably saved this particular art theater from closing down. And this thing ran for years. Well, beyond that point in about 2003, I had an internet lady friend who went by the user name of Janet Dammit and she explained that the name was from a character in the RHPS. Nice lady, I might add. A bit strange, but what the hey? After a while, Janet Dammit revealed to me that she was really Chan Marshall (Cat Power), and she was! Now that was really strange! I ended up buying and reviewing a few of her albums and liked them very much.<br /><br />Alas, what next? Well, I'd pretty much forgotten most of this until I was browsing the Wal-Mart five-dollar DVD rack and a copy of \\"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\\" was sitting there. Out of curiosity, I bought it. I watched it last night. The movie was proceeding along with a wedding of a really straight couple and then they left through an increasingly intense rain storm. Finally, they got stalled and a tire blew out and there was no spare. They were forced to walk back a couple miles in the rain to a castle they had passed by to search for a phone. Well, they got to the castle and a really creepy fellow answered the door. Finally, they were let in. Okay, from that point, the movie made little sense with me. It was a parade of some of the stranger characters I can remember seeing on the screen and it was all set to some rather good music. I guess you'd say it was a musical, but it was the most bizarre musical I can ever remember seeing, it made no sense at all and then it ended in a very strange way. I guess I'd just have to watch it all over, maybe several times, to try and comprehend.<br /><br />Well, one of the ways to gain some understanding would be to go to the bonus features. You guessed it, they didn't work. None of them. I tried over and over. It must have been a defective disc, and I not a lot of other reviewers have had similar problems. Well, I'm left to rate a somewhat enjoyable but very strange movie. I'll be trying again at some later date.<br /><br />Gary Petersoner characters I can remember seeing on the screen and it was all set to some rather good music.

B008MEM24S|5.0|I really LOVE this game! The graphics are HD and great! Never freezes, uploaded just fine! Its JUST like the original Where's My Water, but with Agent P and Dr. Doof! Great game for Perry lover's! :)
B006RUJST6|5.0|I read a lot of books but i have never felt the need to write a review until I read Slammed! I read the book twice before i decided to write this review. I fell in love with the book the first time but when i re-read it i fell in love with it again but for different reasons. This book is everything a great romance novel should be! There is love, death, sickness, friendship, and most important in this book poetry. I have never been into poetry but every poem in this book captured me no matter what it was about! Everyone should read this book and re-read it again and again and fall in love with something different each time!! Then read Point Of Retreat it is just as great as this one! I cannot wait for the third book!

B001CIPU3G|5.0|Trivium has taken the metalcore scene by storm over the past decade with amazing riffs, vocals and just overally amazing music. I will start by saying that I'm sort of a new Trivium fan only knowing about them for a couple years now. This is currently my favortite Trivium record but this often switches out with Ascendansy on occasion. I was not extremely impressed with their debut album Embers Into Inferno but I give Matt Heafy lots of credit because he wrote that whole album at 17 years old which is the age I am right now. Being a guitar player for about 10 years I have a lot of respect for guitar players and one of the absolute highlights of this record is fantastic guitar playing between Matt and Corey. The riffs are just infectious and seductive on this record. I notcied that this record also takes ideals from both Ascendansy and The Crusade such as the metalcore roots from Ascendansy and the Thrash Metal riffs from THe Crusade and combined them into this epic record. I will now do a song by song review pointing out positives and negatives (if their are any). Keep in mind, this is my opinion and opinions will vary between the metalhead community:<br /><br />1. Kirisute Gomen 9/10 - This is a great opening song wih the acoustic entrance and then it decends into this epic anarchy of sound. This song had to grow on me because I was not particularly fawned of it at first but I now realize the expert musicianship and lyrical brilliance. The idea and lyrics are quite fascinating and I would recommend looking into the meaning of the song for any real Trivium fans. The riffs are top notch and chorus is catchy.<br /><br />2. Torn Between Scylla and Charybdis 9/10 - This is another amazing song with a great opening riff. The guitar solo is downright orgasmic with sweeps and arpeggios like no tomorrow. The lyrics are once again very interesting and highly original. I found the drumming to be prominently amazing on this track for it stands out beyond comprehension. I just love this song!<br /><br />3. Down From The Sky 10/10 - This is single material for it is more accessible and mainstream compared to the rest of the record but that doesn't mean anything because this is one of the best songs on the record. The chorus is extremely catchy and the lyrical content is of most interest. The pre-chorus is just brilliant, it brings out so much emotion, it's basically the only part with screaming. The guitar riff in the chorus is brilliant. The breakdown is heavy as hell and the guitar solo is just so unique in every way. I can't say enough positive words about this song, just listen to it!<br /><br />4. Into the Mouth of Hell We March 9/10 - This song is hard to describe for me because I love it, but the opening riff decieves me. I like it but it doesn't amaze me like the other opening riffs for the other songs. I do however love the chorus and think it's one of the catchiest on the record. I love the little breakdown after the second chorus and I find that the song picks up at this point. I think Matt's vocals shine at this point and then the guitar solo of course is brillaint and original like all the others. I should've probably given this a 10/10 but I need to differiate between my absolute favorites.<br /><br />5. Throes of Perdition 10/10 - What an amazing opening riff, I love the cymbals in the background and then this epic double kick drum stuff breaks out with this amazingly heavy riff and then breaks into heavenly lyrics and another catchy riff. This is another one of my favorites. I love the chorus, the solo everything about it. It has a similar heavy pre-chorus like Down From the Sky which is a plus in my opinion. The drums on this song are probably the best on the whole album so if your a drummer, this is a pretty good challenge for you, great dynamics.<br /><br />6. Insurrection 8/10 - This is a straight up thrash metal jam, great song. This could've been a great song on The Crusade but here it fairs as one of the worst which means nothing because it's an amazing song with  a great riff and epic, pounding drums. The lyrics fall short on this song, I feel that the title of the song is forced into the lyrics. Not the best offering in that form but this is made up for witha great quiet breakdown and building into this almost black metal influenced bridge and then into this great guitar solo.<br /><br />7. The Calamity 8/10 - This another great song, great riffs, another catchy chorus and some more great drumming. I particularly love the bridge after the second chorus and the first verse. I also love the guitar solo, another original sounding solo with sweeps galore. This is better than Insurrection by a hair thanks to the epic verse.<br /><br />8. He Who Spawned The Furies 9/10 - I love the lyrics for this song, they stick out so well. I love the groove metal entrance riff and then I also enjoy a less catchy chorus that still holds an amazing sound. The harsh vocals are used sparingly on this song but they are positioned so well and I just love this song. I think you can guess the guitar solo is amazing according to the previously reviewed songs. But before that, the bridge between it and the chorus is just so heavy and beautiful. This is in my opinion the third best guitar solo behind Into the Mouth of Hell... and the song after this one.<br /><br />9. Of Prometheus and the Crucifix 10/10 - This is my favorite song the album, what an amazing song that holds everything I would want in a song. Great vocals, great lyrics, amazing riffs, great solo, the catchiest chorus on the record and pounding drums, I LOVE IT!!! The highlights of this song include chorus, guitar solo and pre-chorus. Just listen to it, this is defintly worth a spot on your ipod for life!<br /><br />10. Like Callisto To a Star in Heaven 9/10 - Another great song with a heavy opening riff with pounding drums. The lyrics are amazing on this song and the vocals are just so angry and merciless. The pre-chorus and the chorus are the obvious highlights with that deep voice pronouncing the title of the song and the catchy chorus dragging in the listener. I feel the second verse is better than the first and the guitar solo shines as well.<br /><br />11. Shogun 6/10 - This song befuddles me, it's not the length because I'm a huge progressive metal fan and I can handle length. The musicianship is amazing in this song nonetheless but I just don't feel a flow to this song. I feel that's just one of those songs saying \\"oh look what I can do with my instrument\\". It might be a highlight for some but to me it's the worst on the album. Don't get me wrong, I still like it and listen to it when I listen to the whole record consecutivly. Just shorten it and put more melody and flow.<br /><br />This is album is epic is every facet and i highly recommend to all metalheads who want great riffs and great vocals. I love it and I hope you do too. Pick up all their discography while your at it, In Waves (their new record) is also quite amazing.
0345803507|5.0|Ok, so the first two books are not \\"exceptional\\" as far as writing goes, but they are a fun, exciting, and engaging read!  The 3rd book in the series, fifty shades freed, was the most compelling.  After reading all three books, I liked how the final book showed character evolution, while still keeping the story interesting an exciting.<br /><br />This trilogy is an excellent summer read that kept me very entertained while traveling with my husband on vacation!

B000FBJHZS|4.0|Read Dan's Lost Symbol and wanted to read this as well. Was a really good book. Typical Masonic conspiracy theory, but with a slight twist (you'll have to read it to find out!) Having a fair amount of knowledge of Masonic ceremony and such, I have to say the book was pretty accurate. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes conspiracy theories as well as a book about government involvement in such conspiracies.

1439192812|2.0|I am very sorry to say that The Magic of Reality was a disappointment. I was looking forward to it because the idea is a good one and I wanted to share it with some of my young students.<br /><br />To be a children's author and a children's book illustrator is a great skill. You have to put far more effort into getting it right - your readership is going to be far more critical.<br /><br />If this is going to be a book about the magic of reality I would expect to see a lot of magical reality inside. Looking at the dust cover (the US edition) I was anticipating lots of the visual treats we have come to expect nowadays: stunning images from NASA, biological micrographs, geographical landscapes, MRI scans, pictures of museum dinosaurs and so on. I would also expect to see some images from myth and traditional stories to contrast with reality. The images should be clear, coherent and complete, introduced systematically and discussed. Instead what we get is a visual mess - David McKean over-egging the pudding to try to show off his \\"artistry\\". Dawkins' text overlays the illustrations, something which from the start makes it difficult to read. The one image - the only one - that has any sense of wonder in it is the one on the dust cover and pages 22 an 23 of the hardback US edition.<br /><br />My general impression is that this is a book written and compiled in a hurry. It is cramped and done \\"on the cheap\\". Not enough critical thought has gone into it. Even the serif font seems dissonant. It certainly lacks the critical eye of a children's book publisher.<br /><br />It seems that people rather like the audio book version and perhaps it should have been left at that.<br /><br />This is a first edition and perhaps I should not have raised my hopes to high. A book like this IS needed but I would suggest it be bigger, more coherent and meet the expectations of a modern young readership. It should not be done by one author but should be a compilation of different specialists- including fiction writers like Salman Rushdie to help illustrate the difference between the world of the imagination and the world of science. It should be a grand project and not just another title to add to the oeuvre of an already best-selling author and public personality. Richard Dawkins is too busy to attempt something of the proportion demanded by this task on his own. Mr McKean should have no part to play in any future edition or similar work.
014303961X|2.0|Lady Chatterley's Lover by D. H. Lawrence<br /><br />Plot:<br /><br />The story concerns a young married woman, Constance (Lady Chatterley)--n&eacute;e Constance Reid--whose upper-class husband--Clifford Chatterley--has been paralyzed due to a war injury. Constance--Connie--was brought along her sister Hilda--amongst intellectuals and had lost her virginity as a teenager.  She was a well educated and free spirited woman who could hold her own in a conversation with men.<br /><br />Clifford was a a shy man, who was the younger brother--Herbert being the oldest--and was unhappy with inheriting the money and title when Herbert was killed in WWI.  He took a wife at the insistence of his father--Sir Geoffrey--and married Connie, after his sister--Emma--rejected the idea of marrying her own brother.  Clifford had a one month honeymoon with Connie, and went to war.  He survived it paralyzed from the waist down, thus unable to function sexually and fulfill his obligation of creating a heir to the family.<br /><br />In addition to Clifford's physical limitations, his emotional neglect of Constance forces distance between the couple. Clifford asks Connie to father a child with another man, hopefully from the same social class as the Chatterley's.  Connie's sexual frustration leads her into an affair with the gamekeeper, Oliver Mellors. The class difference between the couple highlights a major motif of the novel which is the unfair dominance of intellectuals over the working class.<br /><br />The novel is about Constance's realization that she cannot live with the mind alone; she must also be alive physically. This realization stems from a heightened sexual experience Constance has only felt with Mellors, proving that love can only happen with the element of the body, not the mind. thus at the end she decides to leave Clifford and marry Oliver.<br /><br />Comments:<br /><br />In Lady Chatterley's Lover, Lawrence comes full circle to argue once again for individual regeneration, which can be found only through the relationship between man and woman (and, he asserts sometimes, man and man). Love and personal relationships are the threads that bind this novel together. Lawrence explores a wide range of different types of relationships. The reader sees the brutal, bullying relationship between Mellors and his wife Bertha, who punishes him by preventing his pleasure. There is Tommy Dukes, who has no relationship because he cannot find a woman whom he respects intellectually and, at the same time, finds desirable. There is also the perverse, maternal relationship that ultimately develops between Clifford and Mrs. Bolton, his caring nurse, after Connie has left.<br /><br />It is a slow read, bordering on the boring....ch can be found only through the relationship between man and woman (and, he asserts sometimes, man and man).

B005ZMTYTQ|5.0|I'm amazed at how many reviewers disliked this film. I found it<br />gripping right from the get go--the \\"aliens at war with<br />each other on earth\\" theme starts in the very first scene. I did<br />find the young hero's stubbornness irritating; he's the sort who,<br />when you have to get away *now* just stands there. There are plenty<br />of twists in the plot, special effects, and all that suspense stuff,<br />so even if you aren't grooving on the plot, you won't be bored. And--<br />this is NOT a spoiler--make sure you take note of the girl who<br />sets something on fire early on without any explanation. It pays<br />off later in the action.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I wish I had read the reviews of this book first. Everything they say are true. I could not even finish it...that bad. I hate to think I wasted my money..but I hate more to think it went to the author! I too took it for granted being in the number one position on book list. Never again will I make that mistake. Read the reviews,  all you need to know about this book you will learn after 3 or 4 reviews. Don't waste your time or money on this book.
B004XANKVO|5.0|If you are looking for a flashing bag I would go with a Ogio RSS II but Thule makes a better quality bag that isn't made in China.  The bag has plenty of pockets but not too many like most off the Booq bags and I didnt think I would but I love and use the \\"Stuff it\\" pocket, which it a cool zipperless pocket on the top of the bag.  Although the hardshell cellphone/sunglasses pocket can me crushed I do trust it holding my HTC Thunderbolt and Oakleys which fit perfect and feel protected. I like the material, which is waterproof, that the bag is made of and it seems very durable. This bag is advertised as a 17\\" laptop bag but it holds my 13\\" MacBook Pro in a sleeve fine and it feels safe. I use and 10.1 inch Asus Transformer Prime TF201 Android Table and it fits very well in the \\"iPad Sleeve\\". In conclusion, this bag is a large, simple, well made bag that does nothing more and nothing less than it needs to.

0718158113|5.0|While this book will soon be available in the U.S. minus the metric measurements, I couldn't wait after seeing the BBC series via online torrent sites. The book is not a 100 percent mirror image of the recipes you see in the show (slight little differences in recipes), but it is so very close and gives you much more detail to compliment the TV series.<br /><br />Beautifully displayed with a photo of every recipe (unlike the majority of books from Rachel RAY who has to be a cheap s*** and cut quality for the sake of profits), THIS Rachel went to the trouble to warn would-be chefs with little hints to avoid disasters (as in her exquisite creme brûl&eacute;e recipe).<br /><br />Never prepared French food? Rachel includes a great 'French Basics' section in the back of the book that explains the importance of sauces and dressings and gives over 10 different recipes (Hollandaise, Mayonnaise, Bechamel, etc.). Oh, and there's a weight and temperature conversion chart in the back for those who don't want to wait for the U.S. version of this book and get on with the U.K. edition.<br /><br />All in all, a great book if you want to try your hand at basic French food with a touch of British flair. Well done, Rachel Khoo!
B006RUJST6|5.0|Fell in love with the characters and didn't want to stop reading.  Interesting twists.  It was funny too, in parts, it had me laughing out loud, which I hadn't known to expect, but I thoroughly enjoyed.  I like Colleen Hoover's sense of humor.  I think slam poetry could solve all major disagreements!
B008MEM24S|5.0|Where's my Perry is a great app that is a fun and is an interesting puzzle game. If you enjoy games where you have to figure out a puzzle by using your fingers and mind you will like this app. It is very similar to where's my water with a few differences. 1. The \\"-inators\\" are very interesting and make the game similar to the show phones and ferb.<br />2. The background voices make the game cool because you can listen to voices of characters you know and love while trying to figure out puzzles.<br />3. The last difference is how the water and steam move, it is similar to real life physics.<br /><br />This app is good for puzzle lover's of all ages and fans of the where's my water app.

Evil genius wants to kill the people Holmes cares about. That's it. There's nothing else to it.  Couldn't they have taken 1% of their budget and spent it on a screenwriter?

B003Y5HWK4|5.0|I'm a big fan of the show, so much that I wanted the first season on disk. Go to show reviews on google or whatever if you want the show reviews.<br />I'll touch on the extra features and picture and sound of this package. There's not too much to say, but it's a good product.<br />All kinds of behind-the-scenes and such on the extra features which I really enjoyed watching. There was commentary on some episodes which was also interesting.<br />Great picture and sound, after all it's Blu-Ray and HBO.<br />Product came shrink-wrapped in great condition.

1419703692|5.0|[[VIDEOID:moOQLXC0NW0WR8]]As a big fan of what Mr. Nolan has done with the Batman character in his \\"Dark Knight Trilogy\\", this book is 300+ pages of pure joy!  Every aspect of the filmmaking process is detailed in the book, accompanied by hundreds of photos (many of which I have never seen published before).<br /><br />Here are the Chapters contained in the book:<br /><br />1. Screenplay - how the concept of the films was born with Nolan & David Goyer, writing the scripts, and taking inspiration from the comics when crafting the story.<br /><br />2. Production Design - building the sets, scouting & dressing locations, designing Batman's vehicles.  Includes some concept art.<br /><br />3. Cast - casting the characters, insight into the actors' process.  One of the best aspects of the films is that Nolan assembles a very strong cast, even in smaller supporting roles.  Obviously, much of the focus is placed on selecting Christian Bale to play Bruce Wayne.<br /><br />4. Costumes & Makeup - discussion about the costumes of the film, including plenty of costume sketches.  Includes detail about the evolution of Batman's suit, the Joker's makeup, Bane's mask, etc.<br /><br />5. The Shoot: Batman Begins - a chronicle of the 129-day shoot, Nolan's directing style, filming on location, shooting the Tumbler chase, etc,<br /><br />6. The Shoot: The Dark Knight - filming in Chicago, IMAX cameras, the hospital explosion, etc.<br /><br />7. The Shoot: The Dark Knight Rises - filming in Pittsburgh and India, shooting the opening plane sequence practically, destroying a football stadium, etc.<br /><br />8. Special Effects & Stunts - insight into the stunt work with effects coordinator Chris Corbould.  This covers most of the big fight sequences and stunts in the three films and how they were achieved.<br /><br />9. Editing, Music, and Sound - Lee Smith on editing the films, and specifically how be cut effectively between parallel story lines and action.  Scoring the film, including quotes from composers Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard.  Designing the film's sounds and mixing them effectively with the music (they discuss the clarity issue of Bane's voice).<br /><br />10. Visual Effects - It seems like these films used every method of visual effects available, from models and miniatures to computer-generated effects.  Specific topics include creating digital bats and the monorail crash in Batman Begins, the ferry boat sequence from The Dark Knight, and the stadium explosions in The Dark Knight Rises.<br /><br />11. Marketing - A discussion about the promotion of the films.  This includes traditional methods like posters (with over a dozen poster images in the book) to the unique \\"viral marketing\\" that emphasized social media to get the audience to participate in the marketing.  Other topics include screening the IMAX prologues and San Diego Comic-Con.<br /><br />The book also includes a foreword by Christopher Nolan and an introduction by Michael Caine.  Also, printed at the end of the book is a tribute that Nolan wrote about Heath Ledger, titled \\"Charisma as Natural as Gravity\\" (originally published in Newsweek in 2008).<br /><br />This is the best book about the Batman films I have ever seen, and it is one of the best \\"making of\\" movie books in general.  The detail in both the text and the photographs is very impressive, and I am so excited to be able to have this wonderful book in my collection.<br /><br />To see photos from inside the book, visit my blog at MovieArtBook(dot)com<br /><br />If you're particularly interested in the design and technology aspects of the films, I'd also recommend this book: [[ASIN:1608871045 The Dark Knight Manual: Tools, Weapons, Vehicles and Documents from the Batcave]]sounds and mixing them effectively with the music (they discuss the clarity issue of Bane's voice).    10.

0789324563|3.0|[[VIDEOID:mo1GYRJLLKWJY8R]]This is a reprint of a book released in 2008 - fortunately, the price has dropped significantly making this a much better purchase.  But it is still a bit disappointing, given that a very small percentage of the book is actually devoted to art.  To be fair, the art is quite spectacular... there just should have been a lot more of it.<br /><br />If you are expecting a book full of imaginative artistic images, this is not the book you want to purchase. As a fan of \\"The Dark Knight\\", I received this as a gift, and was shocked at the limited amount of art contained within. The first 65 pages serve as the production art portion, with the remaining pages all devoted to the shooting script.<br /><br />The script is interesting to read through, but its not the main reason most people buy a book like this. Of the artwork that is included, the highlights include the new design of the batsuit and the batpod. Also, it is interesting to see the progression of the look of the Joker. The book shows concept art that is very different from what the final character looked like.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great when you are bored and need something to do.you start out with a couple of games and unlock them with points you win with other games.
B005F3XV62|4.0|Movie is fun and funny too. Both for kids and a bit older too. Great job with animals especially the gorilla, wonderfully real looking and moving. Great with other animals talking too. CGI has come a long way.

One day i come home and find the lights on the mouse were off and the mouse no longer worked.<br /><br />Steel Series customer service is horrible. Its now been 20 days since i opened a support request with no resolution or replacement. They sent me some generic fixes which did not solve the issue and its been 10 days since i reported back to them that those fixes did not work. It seems they have abandoned my request at this point.

B003O86FMW|2.0|I found the love triangle completely unrealistic poor me I have to love Peeta. Poor me he loves me so much. Poor me. Whine. Whine. Whine. When she wasn't wracked with guilt with Peeta's love for her she was craving his body next to hers all while in fear of her life. Her priorities were suspect and distracting.<br /><br />This time I really found the narration in first person really annoying when the writer was making clues so blatant. The ignorance within the narration was extremely frustrating.<br /><br />((SLIGHT SPOILER))<br /><br />I really enjoyed the first book but this second one was lacking. The Arena scene was a chore to read through. You already knew what was going to happen. It felt like the writer was just going through the motions to hurry up and get to the last book. In the end nothing that Katniss did seem to have any effect. The stiff, boring characters around her had it already planned out in the end.<br /><br />I sincerely hope the third book is better.
B000I5XOW8|5.0|This is one of my faves.<br />Great action and performances, especially from Tommy Lee Jones.<br />The PQ abnd AQ on the blu-ray is pretty darn good, and the extras are nice too.<br />The funny thing is I have never seen an episode of the TV series on which the film is based.<br />This was followed up by [[ASIN:B0076YFJUY U.S. Marshals [Blu-ray]]], which is almost as good as this film.<br />Very recommended!
0984999302|5.0|How can you debate systemic, venture innovation rooted in common-sense?  I mean that.  When you get at the root of Lean Process & Agile Software Development - which is where Blank is pulling alot of the fundamental principles on which this book is based - it is centered around the reality that no one can accurately predict the future based upon the exact same set of assumptions for an extended period of time.  Attitudes change, ideas develop and evolve; resources shrink and grow in abundance.  Couple this with the fact that you must satisfy a customer dilemma - known or unknown, need or high desire - in a manner that they feel is effective, relatively efficiency and worth compensation.  This book helps entrepreneurs & business leaders focus on using feedback from marketplace to develop both product/service improvement as well as create branding and buying with potential purchasers.  This just makes sense right? Almost common sense, no? I mean what is more effective than identifying your potential early adopters and getting them to participate the in the \\"refactoring\\" process?  Why it took so long for this book and Business Model Generation to be written, I will never know. All I know is that when you put them together with Lean Startup & Service Design Thinking , You really start to understand the meaning of the phrase \\"Game Changer\\".  Because after reading them, you won't do anything that doesn't position yourself as a Game Changer yourself, ever again.  Seriously.

B000J10ER4|1.0|The disc I received does not work. I've tried it in several players, and the trouble definitely lies with the disc.
B004LWZW24|3.0|I love horror movies.  I had missed this when it was in theaters and decided to just buy it and watch it.<br /><br />The plot follows a couple with three young children, who have just moved into a new home.  Within a day or so, the oldest son, Dalton, slips into a catatonic/coma-like state, though no reason can be found for it.  As other things begin to happen - the house alarm going off, the front door opening when it was closed and locked before, etc. - the family decides to move.  But, as the DVD cover tells you, it's not the HOUSE that is haunted.<br /><br />As soon as they move into the new house, doors are opening and closing on their own and records switch without anyone nearby.  Clearly, the issues are not stopping, so a psychic is contacted to explain things.<br /><br />The acting performances were pretty good, especially that of Rose Byrne.  She continues to be a very watchable star.  I'm not a huge fan of Patrick Wilson and I found his character quite annoying (last night, you thought someone had broken into your home, but it's okay to start working late every night now?  Nooo.) I also enjoyed Barbara Hershey in an understated performance as Patrick Wilson's mother.  The psychic, Lin Shaye, was fabulous.<br /><br />Overall, the story didn't wow me that much.  It worked for me in that what your mind goes to is usually much scarier than what you're being show on screen - like the original Psycho.  Less blood and guts and a better storyline are always welcome, and this movie has those.  But scary?  Not really.  Especially when you know that the folks behind Paranormal Activity were behind this one as well.  It uses a very similar formula, especially at the end.<br /><br />It's well done, but it won't knock your socks off.
B005SCSL56|4.0|I read this book in about 5 hours as I couldn't put it down. I loved the way Chris wrote the adult versions of all of my favorite characters. I especially enjoyed his version of Goldilocks & the explanation for all of the \\"Prince Charmings\\". I always wondered as a child how everyone married Charming.<br /><br />There was one very obvious part in the book where a word was missing. As well as a time or two when the characters said something that seemed completely out of character. I think the book could have used another round of editing, but it was well written & obviously well thought out.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the story & can't wait to read it to my students when we learn about fairy tales this year. I will have to skip over a couple of sentences (like the description of Red Riding Hood's nude painting) but I think they will enjoy the telling.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I like the Color and the different levels. SUPER FUN PEPOLE BYE THE GAME.  great game it makes u think
B006RUJST6|5.0|Slammed and Point of Retreat (second in series) are a must read. I read Slammed in a couple hours and POR same. I really felt connected to the characters. I laughed, I cried, I didn't want it to end. I can't wait for more :)
B008JGSM6G|5.0|We all enjoy. You have to think rather then mindless other games. Make it easy ornament it hard. Everyone can succeed.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I love this game on the PC and I was so happy to see it ported to the android phone. This, IMO, ifs the ultimate tower defense game. A+++
B007J4T2G8|4.0|To me, this is a story of 2 most unlikely people, and the experiences that draw them together. I dont want my review to give away the ending of the book. I liked it. It brings up a lot emotions about insecurities that are in people.
B006XIR9KM|4.0|I was quite surprised at how good this app was. A simple match game with a cadre of added twists. Some of the games were a bit difficult to discern the difference (two different ones which offer extra time for completing matches... what's the difference?). All in all, good fun and a good memory exercise.
B004EPZ084|5.0|If you've never seen this movie, I'd advise you to do so. It is a hilarious movie with an interesting plot line. Well executed in every way. As for buying it here, you'll never find a cheaper price for a new copy (trust me, I always try), and the shipping is fast and free with amazon prime. Even without, just buy more than $25 worth of movies and you'll get them within a week with free supersaver shipping. You can't go wrong with buying this movie here.
B008MEM24S|4.0|very cool game and lots of fun for all ages! I love the balloony mini games in the bonus rounds.
