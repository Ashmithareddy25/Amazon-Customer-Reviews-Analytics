And it you thought &#34;Progress&#34; was stunning,  please search out this accompanying (2 CD) set.  Every song on the second CD is fantastic as well.  I've lost track of how many times I've had this entire set on &#34;repeat&#34;.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's fun. You have to try this app, you'll become addicted. Word filling to make this comment longer... seriously it's not long enough yet?
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Just returned without reading. Based on these reviews I'll leave it at two books & am not looking forward to the movie now, bummer! I can't go through all that just to watch Tris get killed. If I wanted the sadness of the real world I wouldn't be reading a book, I'd be watching the news.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very exciting and really keeps your brain moving. The puzzles change so it doesn't get boring. Challenging and fast paced fun!
6305428387|5.0|This is one of the &#34;all time feel good&#34; movies that my grandkids and I have watched since they were two. They are now teenagers and we still watch it and laugh.  If a teenagers likes it....it must be good.
B00E4V09VQ|5.0|...gotta say, I've never been a huge mono purist. But I do prefer the Beatles' records in mono because that's how the band themselves envisioned them -- ditto Phil Spector and Brian Wilson's masterpieces. But I don't find it inherently superior or anything...<br /><br />But this was a revelation: The old stereo mix was kind of a classically '60s, dopey thing, with wide separation and little to no bleed, giving it a very artificial, disembodied quality that served as a barrier to the listener. That said, the music is so dang amazing that it didn't matter too much.<br /><br />Hearing producer Richard Perry's original mono mix, which was apparently scrapped by the label in favor of the gimmicky stereo version, is almost like hearing this record for the first time: The band actually sounds like a band, the bass is very present and driving, and John French's amazing drumming seems crisper and more dynamic. Beefheart's vocals are more integrated with the band. The whole thing is just way more punchy and exciting.<br /><br />I got it on vinyl, and the pressing is great. Sundazed sometimes skimps on their LP reissues, with no inserts or goodies (even if the CD edition has new photos/liner notes), but they make up for it here with a great four panel insert and a reproduction of the original sticker included with the album. David Fricke's notes are ok, but I honestly don't trust anything he's written since he gave the John Fogerty greatest-hits-with-guests album five stars.<br /><br />If you're on the fence about this one, go for it...you'll be glad you did.
B00AA2I2NK|2.0|I had high hopes for this, as it was recommended in a Hi End Audio magazine that I purchase.  I'm a huge fan of Steve Roach, Patrick O'Hearn, Harold Budd, Constance Demby, etc.  This however, has to be the most boring, unimaginative, predictable example of &#34;new age shlock&#34;  I've heard in a long time.  I wonder if the reviewer for the magazine has actually heard any of the artists I've listed above, for reference?  If you're into meaningful ambient/contemplative music,  don't waste your money here. Look elsewhere.

B003P2WO5E|4.0|It's a good book, well written and keeps you interested... for the most part. Pretty much nothing happens for the first 90%, and then it gets slightly more exciting during the last 10%. I hope the second book isn't this slow, if it is I may leave the series, which would be disappointing. It just seems that any goal a character has gets set back 10 steps, and in a frustrating way.<br /><br />It follows a few story lines (possible spoilers):<br /><br />Shallan: This is probably the most uneventful, right until the very end. Tons of exposition, lots of extremely logical arguments (which weren't that interesting), also doesn't relate to the other plotlines very much (I'm sure it will later, though). I skipped all these chapters until the end since it wasn't necessary to read to understand the others. Definitely my least favorite.<br /><br />Kaladin: Perhaps the most predictable, but also my favorite because his plotline actually advances. His goals are met throughout the book instead of being wrapped up in the last chapter.<br /><br />Highprinces: Less predictable, lots of hoity-toity events for the fancy kings, but almost everything goes in favor for everyone but whoever you're following. Dalinar, the most prominent, is set back again and again before getting everything he wanted in his last chapter and suddenly taking control of his previously loose life. Also has the \\"killer turning pacifist\\" cliche, but it's well told with enough reasons.<br /><br />Then the book follows other characters for a short time that just help with the overall story. It is a well thought out world with tons of fantasy elements, the author has definitely taken great care with his book.

B00ECR7KX2|5.0|This production, with virtually no seasoned Shakespeareans among the cast and crew, is the opposite of the Kenneth Branagh 1993 film in virtually every way possible, beginning with the fact that several of the Branagh cast were expert at playing Shakespeare. Branagh's version is in color, this is in black and white. Branagh is done as a period piece, this is done as if it were yesterday. Joss Whedon 's cast is composed of mostly actors who had major roles in his earlier projects. The two leads were costars in Whedon's &#34;Angel&#34; series. Nathan Fillion was the star of Whedon's &#34;Firefly&#34; and &#34;Serendipity&#34; projects. What this generally means is that the leads in this production were weaker than in Branagh's production, which paired Branagh as Benedick with Emma Thompson as Beatrice, an incomparable  match which Alexis Denisof and Amy Acker cannot equal. Reed Diamond, however, is a fair match to Denzel Washington as Don Pedro, especially since he fits so well into the latter day &#34;Mad Men&#34; atmosphere of Whedon's film. Sean Maher outshines Keanu Reeves, because Reeves simply blows his part.<br /><br />The performance I was really anticipating was Nathan Fillion as Dogberry. I was not really unhappy with Michael  Keaton's performance, but his slapstick interpretation simply did not fit into Whedon's time and place. As is true of much of this treatment, Fillion goes in exactly the opposite direction, and underplays the comic part, with almost deadpan delivery.<br /><br />Judging by a performance photographed on the stage of the Globe Theater in London, Whedon stays much closer to Shakespeare's lines, although I did detect some speeches left out, such as the song sung early in Act 1 by the messenger.<br /><br />Shakespeare's language and plots are always so rich that you hardly feel you are missing something if you watch two or three versions of his plays. There are so many ways in which they can be interpreted, there is an extra thrill, once you have a good ear for the dialogue, in seeing how certain things are done differently.<br /><br />If you like Shakespeare at all, there is much value to owning both versions.have a good ear for the dialogue, in seeing how certain things are done differently.<br /><br />If you like Shakespeare at all, there is much value to owning both versions.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Well done  I thought that I would never be able to get candy crush for my kindle fire . Many thanks this game is addictive and fun to play.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hopeless was an emotional read from start to finish.  With a title like Hopeless, I was surprised to find so much humor.  Irreverant sarcasm and just plain good humor permeates Sky's relationship with her best friend, her new 'very best friend in the whole wide world', and her budding relationship with Holder.  I smiled so much my cheeks hurt.  Then we start learning about Holder's past, and about Sky's childhood.  There came a point where I needed to take a 'chapter break' myself so that I could breathe freely.  I needed a third hand because one was holding my Kindle, and the other had gone to cover my surprised open mouth, and I needed to turn the darn pages and quickly because I was on this journey with Sky and Holder and needed to know what was going to happen next!  The magic that is Hopeless comes from enchantingly real characters, a love that is founded in purity and innocence which then blossoms into an all-consuming unconditional love.  A love that is tested and proven when the heartbreaking truth of the past throws Sky and Holder into shocking new grief.  With each part of Sky's heart that Holder came to own, they came to own a part of mine.<br /><br />This book deals with mature subject matter and should not be read by those under 17.
B00DYWO09I|5.0|my son bought this game and he says its boring and lacks a challenge i cant say if its true
B00CWY76CC|5.0|fun game you have to think a little. hard to stop playing once you start. keeps you busy for a while
B00BD99JMW|1.0|To be honest I thought my expectations for this book were so low that I couldn't be disappointed. Unfortunately I was wrong. After hearing about the ending from my friend I didn't waste my time downloading the book before asking for a refund. And am I ever happy I did after reading the rest of the reviews on here.<br /><br />My current feelings about this book are: NO just NO.<br /><br />Edited to add:<br /><br />Granted this is the author's story and she can do whatever she likes... deal with characters as she pleases and ramble incoherently all day long.<br />With that said at the end of the day WE the fans are the ones who fork over our hard earned money and waste (spend) our time reading these atrocities... these insults to our intelligence and THAT's why we are free to state with vehemence our opinions. Be they negative or not.
B00BPDR3F6|1.0|The Signature of All Things was my first Gilbert read. Having heard praises on her previous book, I thought it would be an adventure. I kept trudging through, thinking it would take off. Most of the book was too full of botany and unfamiliar facts. I am a pretty good wordsmith, but had to look up terms used. The story lacked intrigue and action. Again, another story full of pathetic creatures. Even the title does not equate. This was overflowing with scenic descriptions and I began skimming, hoping to find something exciting. Even the sexual content was monotonous. This book flopped for me. I have been venturing into historical novels of the pre civil war era, but this made me long for a Patterson, fast moving, who done it book!
B008N9AASC|5.0|This fantastic movie is buitiful, scary and poetic.<br />Type of movie to see over and over again. I loved it
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I can't no matter how much I want to. I wanted to throw this book at the wall and rip all th  pages out I was sobbing when I finished it. Then I went into denial that the book was bad and ended the way it did (Yes folks pretty much everyone dies Tris included) and read the book 19 times willing it to have a different ending and it never did. I just now realized that while I didn't want Tris to die and I wanted Tobias to finally be free and be able to leg go and him and Tris would be happy forever. I realized what a delusion that was. They loved each other yes and they should be together  yes but the point of the book wasn't Tris and Tobias being happy together. No it was about forgiveness, loyalty, and love. This book isn't  romance it is a futuristic set dystopian society. So while I am disappointed in the way the city was just a experiment, that Uriah dies, that Tris doesn't at least get to die with Tobias next to her an  tell him she loved him one more time, and Tobias couldn't get his last kiss, and that Marcus, Peter, and Caleb don't really redeem themselves - This is still the  best book I have ever read because it made me feel all three books changed me and maybe I don't like the way it ended but we don't always get what we want and this book couldn't have ended any other  way.

B008JFUN6E|2.0|Update the SFX of 2001 (which however are still pretty good next to today's CGI SFX) mix with an updated post apocalyptic Mad Max type story, and you have this fabulous movie all the easily impressionable fan boys and girls are fawning over; not to mention all the studio lackies planting cookie cutter 5-star reviews.<br /><br />I forgot I even saw this movie until I was cleaning up my desk and found the ticket stub for this movie. The only reason I watched it was to kill time so I wouldn't have been stuck in that God awful tunnel traffic after work.<br /><br />The visuals, what few there were, are great but the story is old, tired,  worn out, and predictable. This movie was OK but not worth the $7.00 I paid to watch it. With that said, I won't be adding this to my collection even if it's given to me.
B009SJ3GUK|3.0|Loved season 1. This season fell really short as far as plot. The 3 stars are for the great set design and costumes. Loved the mid century period piece aspect.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It was a good game. Takes a little while to load though but overall a fun and great game. I had so much fun playing!!!
B00D7NWTSI|5.0|Great movie! The kids love it! Amazing 3D quality on my Vizio TV. I saw this movie in IMAX 3D and it was just as good on BLURAY 3D.
0307596885|4.0|I enjoyed these short stories altho I do not often read this form.  What I found was that I must not leave a story without finishing it because I loose the thread, unlike a long single story that I can sink my teeth into and get very involved in.

B00DV9QHB8|5.0|I would say this is so far the best recording by Lang Lang. Getting a little bit away from Liszt or Chopin, Lang Lang finally shows us that he can do far more than just technical stuff. His recording demonstrates a passionate landscape with excellent details. You will not regret if you purchase this CD.

B00BD99JMW|4.0|Love the series, Happy I found them. I figure if a book can make me scream \\"NO\\" out loud and yell at the family to let me finish while I cry my way through the end then the author has done a good job with the story. It wasn't the end I wanted, but it is the end we needed. When the rest of the mob calms down maybe they will see the truth, we cared enough to really and actually CARE.
B00CL68BK2|4.0|we always have a hard time finding films we can watch together.  this one had an amazing cast and a great story.  sure it was a love story, but the characters were so interesting and tortured that it is almost impossible to not be engrossed with the film at large.

B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|While other reviewers seem to be more experienced in the literature on the historical Jesus, I am not one of them. However, this was an educational and enlightening look into the era of Jesus and his apostles, and gave me a better understanding to what I had learned in religion class at my Catholic elementary. I decided to buy this after the Fox News controversy (anchor interviewing Aslan shows she did no research on him before talking with him) and I was not disappointed. Aslan did a great job of educating me on parts of a faith (that I drifted away from) that I never knew and gave me a better picture of the man, not the ideal.

B0097EWK3A|4.0|This was qreat. I really enjoyed it. Not to hard but to easy either. The only reason I don't give it a 5 star is the price. These games are fun but can add up. Maybe a .99 cent price and I would play more of them.

B00FAPF5U0|1.0|I found the game boring and not one I would play again. It's a good thing that it was free, or I would have felt cheated if I'd had to pay for it.
B00CF34B2I|3.0|I do like the game.  I can't enter the promo codes to unlock cards.  I had to reinstall the game and lost everything I unlocked.  I had to start all over.  That was the most frustrating glitch.  Other than that the game is a lot of fun.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|&#34;A Discovery of Witches&#34; is a real page-turner!  Imagine Twilight or Harry Potter for adults - and I don't mean that it is inappropriate, just that it makes you think more, and the characters and plot are mature.  The plot is involved and I really enjoyed the mix of science and magic.  It really makes you think and may be a bit over the heads of younger audiences.  It's compelling and great fun at the same time!  I couldn't put it down.  I'm already in the middle of the second book of the trilogy!  Go for it!
B009LQKHIO|5.0|I gave this book 5 stars, it was a wonderful story about a young woman surviving a cruel, & abusive ex-husband, the loss of a brother, & finding out what real love is. Quite the change for me as I'm used to reading much more explicit books. However, it was very refreshing to actually be able to see Pride in my mind, feel how Megan struggles with & overcomes what some women actually go through on a daily basis. I really loved the Jordans I must say that Iian was my favorite though. Todds patience, love, & support seemed to be exactly what Megan needed. I will say this though a few editing issues, but not enough for me not to continue; it is free guys & I haven't found very many free contemporary romances that're this well put together. Lovely story, a lovely couple, the sex scenes were very tastefully done not too explicit, and you could really feel the love they had for eachother. In a perfect world people don't have sex out of wedlock. This world isn't perfect & I feel my 5 stars was earned by Ms. Sanders. On a darker note this story brings to light the nature of domestic abuse which is a very difficult issue to read about ecspecially the level of abuse suffered by Megan. Great story!!!!!

I have taken various opportunities to learn about EFT, how to 'attract more wealth into my life', etc., from many of the 'gurus' out there.  Margaret is by far one of my favorites in this field.  She is so real, sincere, and passionate about her work; everything she says and writes resonates with me.  I highly recommend this book, which is another testimonial to Margaret's fabulous work, the message she communicates, and the huge impact Margaret has had in the field of mind/body energy work.  The reader will be able to connect immediately to Margaret's user friendly writing style and will come away with a wealth of wisdom!

Uses PL2303 serial chip so no worries on serial driver front.  Would make sure you download the latest version from prolific's website just to be safe.

I have a three month old and wasted valuable sleeping time to read this book...<br /><br />First of all, the two POV's are awful! I HATED being inside Four's head. It completely ruined the mystery and badass-ness of him. I thought he was such an intriguing character up until this point. Also, Tris and Four sounded to much alike, it was hard to remember which POV i was reading, I had to go back to the beginning of the chapter in several places and check the name.<br /><br />There were so many unanswered questions left, so many wonderful places the story could have gone... ugh I hate that in a book!<br /><br />Not to mention the ending :( Really??? Make us wait a year only to end it like that? Don't try and reinvent the wheel... JK didn't kill Harry, Collins didn't kill Katniss... the ending was completely unnecessary and quite frankly just mean. I get the sacrifice and all that nonsense but really, you drag a character through the kind of hell Tris went through and she, not to mention all the loyal readers, deserve a happy ending!!! I hope Roth is happy with it because I, and a lot of other people, are NOT!
B00CAJP0ZO|4.0|You really have to laugh at the negative reviews on this album.  Yes, this album is pop driven drivel unworthy of the accolades of being called the greatest work of the 21st century - does that come as some sort of surprise?<br /><br />The album has some great tracks, the mixing is what you expect, and it contains... autotune!  Which is of course the most of offensive thing to enter in the halls of sound ever, along with mp3's and telephone photography.  But who cares?<br /><br />This album delivers what you should expect from Will.i.am and does it in all of the style that you could want.<br /><br />Superb!

That was quite a legacy she left the British people.

B00EDX76PW|5.0|It's better - correction - WAY better than the first Percy Jackson.  Yes, it is not anywhere NEAR the book.  It's a little better.  You see, Thor Fedurenthal seems to do that with practically any book adaption of his.  He will make a movie based off of a book, and, somehow, make it better than the book.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|the characters were loveable and made you feel their pain while enjoying their story.<br />I don't know how to articulate a review without giving away the story, so just read and enjoy for yourself.
B00EUS9JF0|2.0|After hearing the first single from this album, I was pretty excited about hearing the rest. Sadly, as with so many other artists, the single is the best cut from the album. On the other tracks, Paul's voice sounds rather ragged. With a few notable exceptions (Willie Nelson, to name perhaps the best example of a voice that seems unchanged from 30 years ago) this happens over time. But other artists of the same era have adapted their singing to better fit their changed vocal range. Not McCartney, unfortunately. When he is not singing in his worn normal range, he is switching to a falsetto that is just as worse for wear. It doesn't work, even with studio vocal overdubbing, and about halfway through the album I found myself getting very depressed.<br /><br />While nothing is as distressingly horrible as \\"Freedom\\", a few of the songs feel like they are filler. And I remember when McCartney's filler was considered outranking many musicians primary work. Not these toss-offs. Both musically and lyrically, they are just too slapdash for an artist of McCartney's stature. Don't even get me started on the production, I'll just say this: the mixes seem way off on more than one track. I have to agree with others who believe that there is no one around McCartney who has the guys to say \\"No\\" or \\"That really isn't working as well as it could, perhaps we might try this?\\"<br /><br />I love Paul McCartney, but not this album.

B00EAIMGDW|5.0|This is a really cute game! I definitely wish it was longer because of how fun it is to play. Hope more&nbsp;levels&nbsp;are added in the future.
B00ERIUO02|4.0|I received the CD today and have played it multiple times, each time appreciating it more.  This is a body of work to be played front to back, although I am sure individual songs will make it into my various play lists as well.<br /><br />I agree with the reviews that this is a departure from former work in that it is not loaded with singles.  I rated this 4 stars for the cohesive and strong work that the tracks represent together.  This is a different Katy Perry, more grounded, self assured, evolving, growing as person.<br /><br />For those that have followed Katy you have to inspired by the wide spectrum of styles, moods, and feels that she can deliver, and it makes me look forward to hearing more from her in the future.

0316055433|1.0|First let me say this is a review of only the first chapter \\"Boy with a Skull.\\" I have always enjoyed Tartt's writing. However before I invest further time in The Goldfinch I would like some feedback/advice on one particular aspect in the first chapter that really grated on me. Theo is first introduced in a hotel room in Amsterdam. And here my problem begins. His lengthy observations of what he sees outside seemed a bit much. Then, when we are in New York his lengthy descriptions of mother, doorman hailing a cab and then his observations from the cab(not once but twice and it was a very short cab ride) of people on the sidewalks and then his lengthy and overly detailed observation of the girl in the museum and then as he makes his way out of the rubble after the explosion he observes more than is necessary and more times than we need to read of, an extensive list of emergency responders, i.e., NYPD, FDNY, K-9, Rescue Operations Battalion, Hazmat, etc. etc. When I am only one chapter into a book and I'm already skimming lines and paragraphs and becoming really irritated with the writer, I wonder if it's worth going on. Such GLOWING reviews this book has gotten! I hoped I would dive into it and never want to surface. If someone reads this review please let me know if the repetitious observations by Theo and/or other characters is a pattern throughout the book.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This was a great book and hard to put down.  You just have to know the SECRET & then what would you do? It really makes you think how you would react.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|This is a great show: great script (never gets cheesy), great acting and great storylines. It has managed to stay interesting and fresh after four seasons and I'm very eager to keep on watching!
B007SGM084|3.0|It was a good read but over rated.  I enjoyed the love interest story between Christian and Ana but after the second book the sex was rather redundant. I skipped most of the sexual stuff just to continue with the rest of the storyline.
006202406X|1.0|CONTAINS SPOILERS<br /><br />I think this may be the most disappointed I have ever been with a book. I read the first two books in three days. I loved the world Roth created and loved the characters especially Tris and Tobias. In many ways I feel that the first two books are better than Hunger Games. So obviously I was incredibly excited to read the third book. After reading the third book I wish I could go back in time and unread it and just make up my own third book.<br /><br />First, I was really excited to have the backstory filled in and have a greater understanding for how the city's society formed. The explanation instead of being exciting and interesting was completely deflating. It made the society that Tris and Tobias so bravely fought for completely pointless. Thier divergent identities became meaningless and empty. The factions and the debate over whether they were good or bad also becomes meaningless when we realize it is just another type of government created in no special way for no real meaningful reason.<br /><br />Second, as other reviewers have already stated if you are going to write a book from two perspectives then I should be able to tell whose perspective it is just be reading their thoughts. The only way I knew I was reading a Tobias chapter was from situational clues not because the voice was distinguishable from Tris's in any way.<br /><br />Third, the love story that drew me in throughout the first two books didn't continue to develop. Tris and Tobias spend most of their time fighting as they did in insurgent so their relationship doesn't feel like it grows at all. They are fighting over the same issues so it adds nothing new to their relationship. So after reading them fight for 3/4 of the book they finally make up and Tris dies?! If you aren't going to show me their relationship evolving can you at least end the novel in a way that I can imagine it growing?<br /><br />And lastly as many other reviewers have stated, I understand that main characters die. However, if you are going to kill a beloved character make it worth it. In this book I feel like Tris died just for shock value. It wasn't a grand gesture, it didn't wrap up the novel in some amazing way. She died for the sake of dieing.<br /><br />I was really excited to see the movie but now I don't know that I will bother because I don't feel like getting attached to characters and a world again only to have them made pointless and meaningless in the last movie.

0684857219|5.0|I began weightlifting in 1998 when I was 15. I started out at 6'3\\", 142lbs. I lifted for about 3 to 4 years and put on about 30lbs of muscle. THEN I BOUGHT THIS BOOK...I decided to read it while I was stationed on an aircraft carrier in the Navy because I wanted to lift weights during my off time to get bigger and stronger.<br />It was the best investment I ever made! I had only been using machines before and this book showed me how to correctly do many free weight exercises to help put on mass and gain strength. It helped me put together my own routines, gave me nutritional knowledge, as well as helped keep me motivated. Since I began reading it and using its principles I have put on at least another 90, yes 90 lbs, mostly of muscle. Here I am 11 years later and I have since free squatted 500lbs and dead-lifted as much as 455lbs. I will say, though, my body began to change dramatically within the first 6 months of applying my new knowledge. It really was the best investment I ever made for getting in shape. Knowledge is power.<br />Whether you are trying to become a pro bodybuilder or just get in good shape using resistance training, this book is a MUST!!!

I sure hope The King is back and based on this, it looks like he is.

0385350864|4.0|At the beginning, I did feel a disappointment in the fact that Mr Darcy had been killed off. However, after finishing the book I can say that it was equally brilliant to her two other bridget Jones books. The descriptions of her messy daily life with her children, her worries, her challenges are so easy to identify with. She has kept Bridget's character exactly as it was and I think although she has aged, it is natural for her personality to remain the same. The book does a good job of describing life's moments both happy and sad in a delicate way while still encompassing plenty of humor. Maybe it could have a little less \\"sex and the city\\" feel to it and I think I would have preferred it if bridget had been in her 40's (not over 50) as it seemed better fit with her character. Overall, definitely worth reading! It was pure enjoyment once I got over Mark's death :) The ending is happy and it's definitely a feel-good story of bridget Jones.

B00AEBB9CS|5.0|Out of all of P.T. Anderson's films There will be Blood is without a doubt my favorite, and it seems that many would agree with me, as it's main character/villain Daniel Plainview is now a very iconic character in American cinema. Out of all of Anderson's film, There will be Blood is definitely the closest that comes to being a horror film, as much of the music and atmosphere of this film is reminiscent of creepy, disturbing films from the 70's such as El Topo and Picnic at Hanging Rock. Of course it's not nearly as \\"out there\\" as the aforementioned films but it definitely has a similar vibe. It essentially follows a gold miner who strikes it rich after discovering oil in the bleak deserts of turn of the century California. Even the ominous title, There will Be Blood, sounds like the title of a horror movie as opposed to a historical drama. Jigsaw anyone? Anyway, in addition to that, and last but certainly not least, the creepy musical score combined with the menacing atmosphere also adds to the \\"horror\\" vibe of the film. Don't be misled though, There will Be Blood is dark, but it is no horror movie, it's a character study of a man who becomes rich and successful, essentially achieving the American dream, but at the cost of his soul and humanity. If there was ever a film that exemplified the saying Money doesn't buy happiness, this would be it folks. Plainview, played with a commanding force and presence by the amazing Daniel Day-Lewis, is matched against the ambitious son of a local preacher named Eli Sunday, played by the talented and underrated young actor Paul Dano, who also plays Eli's twin brother Paul. Rounding out the main cast is his \\"son\\" and business partner H.W. Plainview, who is actually the orphaned son of one of Daniel's workers who was killed in a work-related accident. The 3 hour film follows Plainview's descent into darkness, going from an \\"oilman\\" to a ruthless competitor and murderer. It's not for the faint of heart, but if you're in the mood for a brilliant and fascinating film that takes a dark and cynical look into the \\"American dream\\", be sure to watch this. You won't be disappointed. A solid 5 stars.a brilliant and fascinating film that takes a dark and cynical look into the \\"American dream\\", be sure to watch this. You won't be disappointed.

It took awhile after his death for me to buy this. The Death records are sacred to me and I didn't like the thought of cheapening those by enjoying this. But, I finally caved in. And I could kick myself for not getting it sooner. Love it! If you enjoy heavy metal music and aren't one of &#34;those trendy people&#34; then theres a good chance youll enjoy this. Its not Death so allow that thought to pass you by.Control Denied created a phenominal record with this and all the musicians are top notch. The songs are well crafted and the lyrics are good.

B00AJMQSP0|5.0|Ive been a Helloween fan since1988 when I first heard them. No, im not a fanboy and love everything they've ever done. I believe they've had some rough spots in their career. But, Helloween is a band that after 20 some odd years and numerous line-up changes can still put out great records. I got this because it intrigued me. Could they still rock? The answer came in a resounding YES.This album is one of my newer favs. Going thru some of the rough spots ive gone thru in my life &#34;straight out of hell&#34; has always helped me through. I don't believe theres a bad song on it or a weak one for that matter. It goes right up there with the Keepers 1 and 2, Time of the oath and better than raw.Would highly recommend this disc to any fan of heavier music.

B00FOWX6NM|4.0|The cafe brown case looks really good on my gold iPhone 5s. Everything is working well and it seems very durable, if this case were to fall it seems like the case would definitely protect the phone. It has a nice grip to it and definitely not sticky like other rubber cases. I never took off the back plastic cover only because of all the scratching complaints I've heard about.<br />The only complaint I have is that the volume buttons seem a little hard to press. I like to hold my phone with my left hand, so I need to use my nails and some force to get the buttons to press. I do however like the fact the buttons aren't extruded out too much. If only there was a way to keep the appearance of the buttons the way they are but change the sensitivity of them..<br />Other than the volume buttons, the case is great and I recommend this case to anyone :)
B00571F26Y|5.0|I have had wheat sensitivity for a long time. Since I struggled with helicobacter pylori, a very common bacteria which causes stomach issues. This book really used a lot of research and proof of patient stories to show the incredibly negative affects of GM  wheat. And it is all GM wheat! The connections with wheat and mental disturbances, common maladies, skin disorders, obesity, headaches, dementia, and overall ill health. Fascinating! Changed my life!

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Challenging game that makes you want to come back.  Could say it's addicting! I have many friends and family members hooked.  We ALL really enjoy playing the game
B005COO1X6|5.0|This short story was awesome but too short! I wanted to read more. I wish King would return to this book and continue the story.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Works perfect! Love it. Great product and I highly recommend it if you seek a flawless running software for downloading videos or mp3 music.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really love this game but have been playing on my iPhone for sometime and it sucked that even though I connected to Facebook I had to start all over again. I still love it though.
B00FPGSPQU|4.0|Similar to I & II, not quite as good as 1st movie, but better than #2.<br />Lots of F bombs, all movie long.
B00E9ZFIMM|1.0|This app is too simple, it has no features, there are much better FREE apps available, I would not reccomend anyone buy this.
B0084AXZK0|3.0|I thought the book was too lengthy. The wording is old fashioned and sometimes hard to understand. Dorian was not like the movie character, so I had a hard time relating to him. I did like that the characters and their surroundings were richly described.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|This game is pretty cool but its just like every other tycoon game. Bye houses, get decorations, breed animals, complete goals , and stuff like that. But it is pretty fun because you get see all the ice age movie characters and im kinda addicted to the kinds of games.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|After anxiously awaiting this I was irritated with the book, especially the ending. I don't believe I will EVER pick up another of her books again. I read to go to my happy place, not so I want to erase my own memory.
B00BEIYMIS|4.0|It takes alot to scare me, probably because over the years I've seen it all. The movie is almost 1/2 over before the good stuff starts happening. Anyway the storyline and plot are good and for me there were a couple surprises. The possession scenes were quite good and there are some creepy moments. This is a good haunted house/possession movie worthy of a look..
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Love it! I'm so attached to all the characters and can't wait for next weeks episode!!!!! Keeps u in the edge
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This book gave me exactly what I wanted from the end of this trilogy, a logical explanation of the world of the stories. Some may be unhappy with the ending, you probably know why at this point but far be it from me to spoil anyone! but I feel it was true and accurate to life.
B00005J6UP|5.0|Suspenseful music builds, as light from the flashlights of dangerous and angry pursuers grows brighter from the underground tunnel. The last Goonie is yet to cross the monstrous log connecting the tunnel containing the pursuers to the tunnel that will provide an escape. With the intimidating body of murky water underneath the log, the followers growing closer, and the yells from the other five Goonies to “hurry up” getting louder, the pressured Goonie thinks on his feet (literally). Staying true to his role as the inventive one of the bunch, Data uses his slick shoes to cover the log’s service he has already made past with a slippery tar-like substance. Action music now takes the place of the suspenseful music as Data makes it to the safe tunnel with the others in time for the three fugitives behind the flashlights to appear and fall right into the trap, allowing the Goonies to make their escape! This scene is one of many exciting scenes that makes The Goonies fun to watch.<br />The 1985 American adventure-comedy, directed by Richard Donner, is almost thirty years old and still manages to be a crowd favorite. The majority of today’s popular films such as “The Hangover,” “Olympus Has Fallen,” “Silver Linings Playbook,” “Twilight,” and many others, are centered on drugs, alcohol, world issues, mental problems, or science fiction. Today’s movies take millions of dollars to produce mind-blowing five-star scenery, sound effects, and cast. They are very focused on detail and accuracy, which may sometimes become overwhelming. The Goonies, on the other hand, is very refreshing from these overwhelming movies. Although it only took half of what today’s movies take to create, The Goonies’ enjoyable story line makes it five-star worthy. It is very simple and easy to follow.<br /> The Goonies are a group of friends living in a neighborhood known as the &#34;Goon Docks.&#34; Unfortunately, their houses are being foreclosed due to an expanding countryclub. It is their last weekend together and while searching through the attic, they find an old newspaper clipping, a Spanish map, and a map with a pirate treasure somewhere in the area. Seeing this as the only opportunity to save their houses and childhoods, the Goonies head out to take one last adventure in hopes of finding the famous pirate One-Eyed Willie’s treasure. After a rocky start, the Goonies are on their way. With nasty villains in their pursuit, they travel through the complex underground pathways maneuvering through One-Eyed Willie’s booby-traps and desperately trying to beat the clock of foreclosure.<br /> This movie is enjoyable for all age groups. Although it is clearly a fantasy story, adults are able to relive some childhood memories. It takes them to the days they were young kids going on adventures with friends. It’s pirate treasure theme appeals to kids and teenagers, capturing their interest for the duration of the movie. The movie is rated PG, however, due to some foul language used, it is not recommended for children under the age of eleven.<br /> One key attribute to the movie’s popularity is the characters. Each character is likeable in a unique way. The motley crew consists of adventurous Mikey, wise guy Mouth, food lover Chunk, and gadget inventor Data. Viewers are able to identify with these kids and feel as though they are on the journey with them. They want to protect them, they laugh at their jokes, and cheer when they have a brilliant plan. The characters pull each viewer into the treasure hunt with them.<br /> The sets for each scene are incredibly ornate. They vary from a creepy abandoned restaurant, to musty stone tunnels, to immense waterfalls, to bone pianos and collapsing floors. The fascinating part of it all is that these sights are all within an every day town in Oregon. Therefore, the viewer gets an aspect of the everyday world as well as the fantasy world.<br /> This adventure movie continues to prevail almost thirty years after it was created because it still connects to people today. Situations that occur in the movie, such as foreclosure, are common. In today’s poor economy many people lose their homes. Therefore many people can emotionally connect to the characters and feel a sense of hope throughout the journey.<br /> Along with personal situations, the film also connects with personal relationships. The bond within the close-knit group of young boys is what would today be known as a “bromance.” The boys have such a diverse group of friends, it makes it comical to watch them interact.  They joke around almost the same way boys joke around in today’s generation. The love-hate relationship between Mikey and Brand is also seen amongst siblings today. They joke around with each other, and beat up on each other, but will always look out and care for each other.<br /> Although the dialog for the movie was created in the eighties, humor is humor.  One of the most comical dances still commonly joked about is Chunk’s truffle shuffle. People also still make harmless jokes with their friends just as the boys messed with Data for his extravagant gadgets or Brand for his obsession with bodybuilding. These simple jokes and dances are appreciated by viewers and are quoted and reenacted whenever the movie is brought up. Some humor never gets old. In order to understand the Goonie jokes, one must watch the movie.<br /> The Goonies is a time machine that takes adults back to their childhood. It not only allows them to go back and relive some joys and thrills of senseless adventure, it allows them to bring their own children of this generation with them for the ride as well. The film teaches important lessons on relationships, hard times, and humor. It also provides a bond between two very different generations. Big differences are seen in the 80’s generation and today’s generation. The Goonies allows the two to sit down and genuinely enjoy a movie that will forever be a classic.
1440503257|4.0|I got this for a Harry Potter fanatic I know, and she loves it!  Really wish there could be pictures, but still I love the references to exact mentions of the foods and drinks in books (including chapters and page numbers!)<br /><br />Very fun book! :)
B008JFUR10|4.0|First off this movie is for popcorn eating entertainment, nothing more. There is lots of smashing and tearing monsters apart. The storyline is absurd, not much of a plot, but thats how many fantasy movies are...Seems like an updated godzilla type movie beating up the bad monsters and saving the poor oriental citizens.  Effects/CGI are top rate though and the bigger your tv is, the better the experience...
B00AN0KBJC|4.0|It wasn't as good as season one, and all the Daenerys parts were kind of cheesy. Sometimes specific character threads felt drawn out when they could have just been cut.
B00DPUB56U|4.0|It is an interesting concept of what it must be like to be a vampire being different, having to run a lot and trying to make a life.<br /><br />This one, I think is almost great. Somehow it just did not get there. I did not like the end which I thought did not make a great deal of sense. I also thought that a 200-year-old girl even though she is about 18 years of age should be much more mature.<br /><br />Having said that I thought the acting was good, in particular, Gemma Arterton, did a good job.<br /><br />The characters were not that interesting which I thought was one of the failures of the film.<br /><br />Worth a look.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I don't even know how to explain how unsatisfying an ending this was to me. The entire plot of the newest Government (Bureau) also being corrupt and once again Tris&Co having to come up with a plan to save their world was unnecessary coming after the same 2 plots the one with Jeanine and then again with Four's mother. Now they do it again with David and all just to save peoples memories they have Tris lose her life? The entire exchange between Four and his mother to get her to surrender seemed out of nowhere and she gave in way too fast. She went from dictator who was going to kill Tris and Caleb to warm and fuzzy mommy overnight? Four not being there for Tris, Tris dying at all, the lives in the future seem hollow and just unfulfilled without Tris. If the author intended for a hollow, miserable ending to this series and the characters we have traveled with then it was achieved.
006202406X|1.0|I was so eager to finally uncover the secrets of this spectacular dystopian novel that I preordered the book (which I never do).  I don't recall ever feeling socheated by an author as I do right now.  I feel like I lost a huge chunk of my life that I will never get back.  I have no desire to see the movie version of this series or even spend another second thinking about it.  The unfortunate thing is that I cannot get my time or money back.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy Crush Saga is so much fun. It works your brain without you even noticing. Very addicting though, i cant put it down!  Everyone will love this game from eight to 88. Just don't get too frustrated when your little brother or son loses all your lives.
B00AZMFK3K|3.0|Grade:  Somewhere between a C and a C+<br />JJ = JJ Abrams (the director)<br /><br />Moments that I enjoyed/things I liked:<br />Dreadnought (DRN) class - VERY nice tribute to a similar class in cannon but of a later gen Voyager class.<br />Enterprise (ENT) GOING TO (not in) warp (3rd best next to TNG and Voyager)<br />Klingon atmospheric warbirds - Very Bird of Prey like, kind of a nice salute in a way to cannon Star Trek (ST)<br />Carol Marcus - MUCH more true to the original story next to the Carol of Wrath of Khan (WOK) with perfect personality/looks blend<br />Officer Murphy, ie Robocop as Admiral Marcus, PERFECT casting for the part<br />The transporter, when it works, it is very old school cannon with the right flair for our times, really nice.  Same as in 2009 ST<br />Damaged ENT holding together, she ain't just beautiful, she also has GRIT!<br /><br />Things I would change (but did not necessarily hate):<br />Khan and Kirk space surfing from ENT to DRN.  The scene was good, but inadequately explained why transporters would not work.  This was a CONSTANT theme of this movie in regard to transporters not working (conveniently) to allow a scene to happen.  And ALWAYS without adequate explanation.  Pretty lazy, JJ<br />Weapons exchanges.  Phasers, in ST, are solid and constant beams of energy weapon (both Ship vs Ship and small arms) not bullet like bolts of energy, which is completely Star Wars (SW) and not ST.  I fully blame Paramount for this for taking JJ on as the director per him being a SW guy in regard to his previous movies and should know he would go this direction.<br />Klingons.  The foreheads distinguish for each being different and not having any bling in cannon.  It is a mark of identity and honor not to be messed with decoration.  Lose the bling.  And the helmets, Klingons do not wear them as a toughness thing and always being able to see fully the opponent.<br /><br />Totally Hated:<br />Enterprise underwater.  Completely unnecessary and what Ifound even more funny, Scotty even ranted at Kirk about that!  Right with you there, boss.<br />Uneven (and more so bad) dialog.  I don't know quite how to say this, but I feel like different writers wrote (different parts of) this script.  Some moments were beyond bad.  For example, when the team is down on Kronos and Sulu is in the chair, he threatens Khan in a manner that is COMPLETELY NOT fearsome.  And then, Bones chimes in with some high school comment along the lines of `I hope I never piss you off'. Sophomoric dialog like that permeated the movie.  I don't know how this happened, but I liked Kirk in the 2009 ST, more.  I don't completely blame the actor; because I feel like the scriptwriter (whoever did this part) TRASHED his role. Ergo my earlier comments.  He comes off as and a dimwit for way too much of the movie and is nearly ALWAYS braun vs brain.  This is the antithesis to cannon ST, the Shatner Kirk was an Einstein next to this guy.  Now whoever wrote the Khan scenes was BRILLIANT!  This was an even more appropriate adaptation of Khan than even in original cannon.  Cuberbath basically saved this movie and the scriptwriter for him new perfectly how to match the actor's personality with the character.  With that being said......<br />This movie had almost ZERO originality.  Bringing back Khan was a complete waste of opportunity to do something completely new. Don't even get me started on the switching of the death scene between this movie and WOK.  DRN by its very build had more survivability than ENT.  Typically when a ship is damaged ST cannon explains with full specificity the true damage so the audience understands a near future disaster or recovery to come.  100% not done in this movie.  Looking at DRN coming into the atmosphere, I still don't understand why and how it was more damaged than ENT.<br />Shields.  OMG, do they EVER work in these ST reboot movies! Literally every shot penetrates and does some type of damage in Ship to Ship combats.  Again, I blame Paramount for latching onto a SW guy to do these movies.  Shields are nonexistent in SW, and when they do work, never correctly or with any type of potency.  Just watch the opening escape scene from Naboo in Phantom Menace to know what I am talking about.<br />(while in) Warp Speed.  Horrific beyond description.  Nothing was more perfect than cannon ST with the stars going by looking like shooting stars.  It was simple yet awesome at the same time for viewers to understand the ship at speed.  In this movie and the 2009 ST, the ship is in some ridiculous funnel that just does not resonate. Per my understanding JJ is done with ST, so I hope in the next movie they go back to normal ST warp.<br />LENS FLAIR!  JJ again went overboard with this again.
B00DWZHTRW|4.0|I was not expecting such a movie, so I was surprised by its cleverness and twists. I was kept interested the whole time. How did they do it? Where is this leading to? What I think let it down was the ending was not tied to the story properly. It did not make that much sense as why?<br /><br />Having said that the story is well acted. I liked very much the performance of Jesse Eisenberg, Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine.<br /><br />The characters are interesting. I particularly liked the way Jesse Eisenberg character, kept coming in and out of the movie.<br /><br />Worth a look. I will see it again soon just to figure out so of the twists that I did not follow.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|I read the previous 4 books and loved them. This one is painfully slow. Trudge through slow chapters to get back to something worth reading. Help!

B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great challenging game for all ages. But it stops just about the time you get into it. Disappointed. Great fun for me and my grandkids to play together.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|This comes with a cd of the music, a dvd (including the videos from youtube and the music playing with a yule log), and the digital (mp3) download of the album as well. A great collection, lovely music. I can see this being used as background for Christmas get-together's.
B00B2PHSIY|5.0|I bought this for a dive trip to Curacao.  Worked great, I have some really cool videos.  Makes the video much closer to what you see with your eyes.  I like that it fits over the lens.  It's easy to snap on and snap off.
B000IZXR7U|1.0|I paid to watch this movie - $2.99 for only a 24-hour rental - and didn't even get to watch it, because it wouldn't play on the iPhone, even after we installed the app. Not satisfied with amazon's service at all.

0375869026|5.0|Should be required reading for 5th to seventh  grade.  Actually, it would be good for parents to read too!!  It is a very good book to read with your child!!
630587493X|5.0|I bought this movie because my daughter urged me to.  I am doing research on robots.  When Bicentennial Man arrived I watched it right away.  I usually crochet while I watch movies, but...this time I couldn't!  My eyes never left the screen.  By the end I was crying full of emotion.  Robin Williams never disappoints me, especially this time.  I highly recommend this movie.  We never know what the future will bring do we.

B002PHVHFI|5.0|One of the most influential albums of it's time was a steal on vinyl. The seller sent it still in the plastic wrap with the digital download. Had a slight bend in the corner, but for $2, I'm not complaining
B00ERIUO02|2.0|This album is miles away from Teenage Dream. Except two or three songs, most of it is boring, so annoying and lack of originality.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|A very useful format that is easy to use and easy to read. It goes where you go, and its always a your fingertips.

B001NHNG64|4.0|I personally like Lee Child's style.  I'm glad it's not written in first person, as the first book was (personal choice). The story is great, fast paced from the beginning. A great read.
B00A757EFW|3.0|This is a fun game that does not require internet. It is great to help cope with the boredom of long car rides or plane rides. Not always fun long term, though... I got burnt out quickly. Fun pass time, loads quickly. I would recommend this to a friend.
B00CWIMVDW|4.0|I really enjoyed this show.  Even though it stems away from the actual novel it's somewhat based off of (Red Dragon), I think this is a brilliant adaptation.  I love the characters and the struggle that the main character, Will, must go through to keep himself from going crazy is awesome.  It really keeps you interested.  I seriously can't wait for season two!

B008RA3X5E|5.0|I bought this app to help put me to sleep and wake me up. As a girl with insomnia, it was near impossible to fall asleep with the sounds of a house. I plugged in the White Noise soundtrack I made, with a time limit to shut off. Even if the white noise is off, though, the alarm never fails to wake me with it's assortment of bells and jingles. Very useful apl.
B004S5C91Q|5.0|Fantastic read, couldn't put it down! Highly recommended for anyone, really enjoyed the storyline, sad but intriguing all the way through.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|it is well written and plays with themes of forgiveness ad sacrifice again.  dealing with grief and still findimg purpose though is the idea that stands out in this novel.  well done veronica roth.  i hope the movies can live up to even half of what is displayed in these books.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Love Amazon there is no need for me to pay for expedited shipping!!!!!!!!!!!! Their shipping is super fast I guess it depends on where you live but I got my shipment in like 2-3 days every time just wonderful because I don't really like waiting on stuff. The movie which I have watched a hundred times is fantastic. I'm collecting all of the marvels basically love superheros!!!!!!!!!!!!
006202406X|5.0|I read this book in one day. Halfway through the book, I rated it four stars and then at the end OH MY GOODNESS! I am giving this book five stars because when a writer writes a book so well that you can't stop reading it and you put your life on hold to finish it. When a writer can breathe life into the characters so that they come alive off of the page. That when your character that you love and care for dies, you feel as if you have lost a close friend or loved one. I think this is a sign of a good writer. I was seriously bawling. I am still depressed an hour later.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I wasn't too enthused with almost half of this book but it got better.  Very good and interesting characters, the poor wife had a lot on her plate.
B001DUDKEY|5.0|Persuasion is one of my dearest favorites of Jane Austen, and it's look at matured love is quite poignant.  Austen's attempt to see Anne find herself out of a situation we all encounter (how much influence others should have in our decisions), is satirical yet kind. It's too bad this has less focus than Pride and Prejudice. This film brings the two center characters out without making Anne seem terribly recluse or Wentworth fickle to her. That alone is a delightful accomplishment with Anne having shut herself off (she doesn't smile until well after an hour in), Frederick spending time courting other women to forget her and no narration of inner dialogue. This may seem obvious, but too many movies made are incapable of expressing something without outward display. It's good writing and great acting. All in all, I was able to fall into the story and was pleased with the adaptation.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I love this game. it is relaxing yet a brain worker. love to play while traveling. will download another one when this is completed.

B007ZI06FE|5.0|This book constitutes my first venture into the steampunk genre. I am very glad that I chose Bec McMaster as my debut author for that venture. Her ability to establish an alternate reality is superb.<br /><br />While some sources may term this a vampire story, that is not strictly in keeping with the traditional definition of a vampire, a la Dracula, Twilight or Cat and Bones. No one has fangs, they can go out in sunlight, and the condition is caused by a virus administered to aristocratic males at the age of 15. No one is termed a vampire until the virus metastasizes so far that the blood intake cannot keep up with the blood need and the person literally begins to fade into an albino status. At this point the ruling powers of  London execute the person before he becomes a deformed and clawed creature that is essentially an insane killing machine. They also execute almost anyone, particularly non-aristocrats, who are changed accidentally by ingesting infected blood.<br /><br />And thus the main plot of the story is established.  Our female protagonist, Honoria Todd, is a bio-medical research assistant with knowledge of a vaccine that can prevent the Changing Virus from taking hold to begin with. She is also in possession of notes that detail what promises to be a cure of sorts that would prevent someone with the virus from going into the Fade. Needless to say, she is on the run from the Duke who commissioned the research and who wants to control the vaccine and cure.<br /><br />And, now entering stage right is our male protagonist, Blade, a non-aristocrat, who was infected intentionally by this same Duke. Blade escaped from custody and now, with his super strength and senses, rules the rookery of non-infected humans outside London’s city walls where Honoria goes to hide.<br /><br />The subplot is the issue of trust. Both Honoria and Blade need each other to survive physically, but they have to surmount the need for secrecy surrounding their individual circumstances in order to effect that survival.<br /><br />The story is told in third person POV, alternating between Honoria and Blade. The writing is so coherent and descriptive that you find yourself utterly caught up in the story. It is almost as if you are right there in the rooms and on the streets with the characters. And the need to know how each scene will be resolved is so strong that you have to force yourself to slow down to absorb the details. The scenes flow from one to the other naturally and the action sequences are heart stopping.<br /><br />My only complaint is with the timeline of the story. First, there is no direct statement as to the year in which the story is taking place. There are some oblique references that, upon doing a little math, a general feeling for the early 1880’s is achieved. And, secondly, it is difficult to know whether the story is taking place over a period of several days or several weeks.

B0064X7FVE|4.0|I use this app almost everyday and makes my day better.<br />I would recommend this app for any one who needs to keep an eye on the weather.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The chromecast is an awesome device.  You can connect your droid or Apple phone or tablet easily to any HDTV.  Makes it so easy to watch netflix or YouTube on any TV.  The only drawback is that you need to connect it to AC power with included adapter.  Other than that I highly reccoend you buy one today.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|For price - you cannot beat - and setup took less than 5 minutes - allows for easy streaming from computer to big screen
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|This game sucks it is an app mania if you want to have a good hair salon game try another one
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|I received my Christmas CD yesterday and of course love it!  The piano guys are just not capable of producing less than 5 star music!!!  Their music choice selection is stellar, no annoying Santa songs, just good classic Christmas songs and hymns all performed and written with such satisfying taste. I highly recommend!
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I am not going to write a full review. I agree with what everyone else is saying.<br />To summarize:<br />1.) Tris and Tobias both have a brusque, extremely similar tone. They can't be the same person inside and out, Veronica!<br />2.) I wanted more information about the outside world. It was very limited to the US. And the information we were given just wasn't enough. I almost feel like this series could have had more than three books.<br />3.) The characters I knew and loved were different. Tobias made decisions, not good ones, and that's fine. He doesn't need to be perfect, but the decisions still didn't seem like him. They didn't seem like things that would compel him. Tris seemed cold to me, too controlling. Just like in Insurgent, except perhaps not as suicidal. Evelyn, Marcus, Peter, and Caleb also weren't the same or realistic.<br />4.) Finally the ending. I don't know if Ms. Roth became cocky and decided to kill Tris because she was trying to be literary and not just write for the fans. I don't understand if she was trying to prove Tris' selflessness...anyway I hated it. Tobias was left with pretty much no one. It didn't bring the series any closure at all. I sobbed and screamed because I was so angry and upset. This wasn't what I asked for. I asked for answers and an ending that made me feel satisfied. TRIS DYING, THAT DIDN'T DO ANYTHING GOOD. I'VE FELT RESTLESS AND OUT OF SORTS. Like the ending was ill-fitting.<br />Why?<br />I wish I could talk to Veronica. Maybe she could answer my questions.<br />Or maybe she wouldn't no what to say. Maybe she doesn't know.<br />Maybe she had no idea of the damage she's done. I admired her so much. And now I feel lost.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's finally here.  I would check the app store weekly looking for this game.  Thanks for finally getting it on here.  I can stop killing my phone battery.
B0044DEAUA|1.0|I ORDERED THIS 2 X'S FROM 2 DIFFERENT MERCHANTS ON AMAZON.  UNFORTUNATELY NOT ONE OF THEM WORKED!  FIRST ONE DID NOT GIVE AUDIO AND 2ND ONE DID NOT PAIR TO MY PHONE AT ALL.  I TRIED EVERYTHING!  SO FRUSTRATING BECAUSE I NEED A GOOD HANDS FREE BLUETOOTH FOR MY CAR.<br />WOW!  I JUST WISHED IT WOULD WORK.  OBVIOUSLY THE SELLERS DID NOT MAKE SURE THESE WERE WORKING PRODUCTS, ESPECIALLY THE 2ND MERCHANT I ORDERED FROM BECAUSE THIS WAS SOLD USED AND THE BAG IT CAME IN STAMPED ON THE IT SAID &#34;GRADED BY WAREHOUSE DEALS&#34; SO I WOULD BEWARE OF THIS SELLERS USED MERCHANDISE.  A RETURN COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED BOTH TIMES HAD THEY MADE SURE IT WAS WORKING PROPERLY.  I ALSO WROTE TO THE MANUFACTURER AND WILL NOT ORDER THIS &#34;SUPERTOOTH BUDDY BLUETOOTH VISOR SPEAKERPHONE CAR KIT&#34; AGAIN.  I WILL GO TO ANOTHER PRODUCT FOR SURE!!

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a great product I use the calculator all the time.<br />It has never failed me,it is right there when I need it.<br />I do not have to go looking for another device. It is very<br />easy to use an I recommend it! Get this app now!
B008G12ERC|5.0|What more could you want? The download was awesome and the fact I could download it right after I paid for it was sweet.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book a lot! It keeps you guessing and wondering and wanting answers. I really like the whole storyline and characters.I read this book and immediately bought the second book and dove in. At first I couldn't stand the make-shift lingo the gladers came up with but later on I found it hilarious and enjoyed it! I think this book was written very well HOWEVER....BE ADVISED!! The questions never get answered! I gave this book 5 stars because it deserves it. James Dashner did an excellent job setting up the story the foundation was laid down perfectly but the questions never stop and answers never come...I actually started the 3rd book and got 20% into and returned it because it was just starting all over again...I read some of the spoiler alerts just to see if my perdictions were wrong and what I found out was even worse! I have never not finished a series until this one...this one was very disappointing because Maze Runner quickly became one of my favorite books and book #2 the Scorch Trials was also good but the finale broke my heart. So I would still recommend this book but just be prepared to be disappointed later on in the series.
B007WEQ3K8|3.0|game delivers plenty of puzzles and timed events. lots to choose from to play.  graphics very average to poor. sounds were simple and unobtrusive except for the ninjas game.  overall does what it says but still very annoying app.  not my cup of tea. I hate timed stressful apps and this ranks right up there.<br />for those that like this genre then it would be good for them.
161218412X|5.0|These works are remarkably those of a genius. Captivating, Alluring, while having a sort of untimely edge. Simply exquisite, every novel.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Fun game for all. The early games are great for kids and the latter games are a bit harder! Worth the money.<br />O
006202406X|1.0|I loved the first two books in this series and read Alligiant in one day. WHAT A MISTAKE. I sincerely wish I had stopped reading about 7 chapters from the end and make up my own ending. The whole series is ruined for me and I will NEVER read one of Roth's books again.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I have played this game for years and love it. Never a dull moment and always a challenge. Love,love it
B0041D843M|5.0|This book is a real eye-opener that explains why we are becoming a nation of obese individuals whose children are likely to have shorter lifespans. If you are interested in improving your health in a big way, then this is one great read, start to finish!
1616550414|5.0|I love this book since i opened my box. The protection of the item was very safe and the book wasn't damaged at all. I heard about some people that recieved their books with corners damaged, but mine is 100% perfect.<br /><br />As illustrator and Zelda fan, i recomend this book TO EVERYONE!
B00FXOQO6W|2.0|Like any Joss Whedon fan, I was excited to see his return to television. I grew up watching shows like Buffy and Angel, and have always been a diehard fan of Serenity's crew (those characters were tailored-made for the actors who portrayed them). I have tried to like Agents of Shield, but I find myself doing other things not even halfway through the show. It just...lacks. There doesn't seem to be any coherent storyline being portrayed, none of the characters, other than the would-be hacker/spy, are being developed or given a background. Clark Gregg is a master of the subtle joke and his half-smile is almost his signature look, yet his character is trying to be this hard-azz, no nonsense sort of leader which I never saw him being in any of the movies. Yes, he took his job seriously, but always with a healthy dose of, \\"Can you believe this s***z is happening?\\" The two geeky lab rats need to be put in the airlock and left there at 40,000 feet with the door open; perhaps then they wouldn't be quite so annoying to listen to. Why do unimaginably intelligent people have to be portrayed as wacky or skewed? Ming Na is just sort of there; a character with this apparent bad-azz reputation we only get glimpses of in offhand remarks. Yet, she is relegated to airplane pilot? The male agent is seriously just there as eye-candy, to hopefully bring in some younger women into the view. I feel bad for the actor, really, his character is about as shallow and typical as they come. I hope that in the future the show finds its true sea-legs and settles down into the kickazz show it could be. If the studio is worried about it becoming another, \\"Firefly,\\" where the show was more character interaction than action (and was so much better for it), and thinks the audience wants all action and no substance, then perhaps they should let this show become the next \\"Firefly\\" because I for one would be a fan for life if I saw that same charisma  in A.o.S.
B00BXUG0KU|5.0|Elaine Elias with her sultry voice and nice jazz piano doing a tribute to Chet Baker could not be much better.  I like her Bossa Nova stories album a little better and one song on this album was way way to fast for the song, but all in all very very nice covers of a bunch of classics.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I had a blast playing it. Its awesome trying to find all of the pieces to the puzzle and makes your mind really into the whole game.
B0043ZDU1E|5.0|Mostly great songs that have been around for well over a hundred years, ecept one by Yeats.  All are a pleasure.
B00CEQ1JOO|5.0|OMG!!!!  My daughter loves this doll.  Came quicker than planned and she was so surprised.  It was a prize for straight A's
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Update - Chromecast now supports Pandora and HBO Go.  We use this all the time and ut's usefulness is growing, if it takes Amazon Prime I may move it to 5 Stars.<br /><br />Original review - I love this concept and it works well for what it is.  However, I never saw this addressed on any of the reviews and it would have changed my decision to buy this item.  You can ONLY use this with certain apps for your android, computer or phone.  The only apps that are available for your phone are Hulu, Netflix, Google YouTube and Google play (and Google Play wont play most of the music that is loaded on my phone).  Currently there is not provision to play the videos I have taken with my phone over the ChromeCast directly.  The only way to do that would be to upload my videos to YouTube first (which I don't want to do with private family videos).  You also do not have the ability to view any movies you have loaded on your computer or phone or to even work with other sites like Flixster.  If you are only using Netflix, Hulu and YouTube it works fine but it is limited to those at this time.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I really like playing this game.  It keeps me entertained while the kids are sleep or if I want to kill time.  I recommend candy crush to anyone who enjoys a challenging yet fun game.
B0089LOG02|5.0|This was an excellent book, based off of facts .. the author did a great job telling the story hard to put down<br /><br />i never write reviews , but thought this book was worthy of a review
B00EAIMGDW|5.0|Thoroughly enjoying the experience. The best android  game I have played thus far. It is cute yet you have to think about how to obtain your objectives. Love it!
B00006JL1Z|4.0|I didn't know it would be the Argentinian edition I was going to be purchasing. It surprised me when I realized the artwork of my copy was different from this picture you can see on the left. I was a little disappointed because I like the American artwork better but the CD is terrific anyway.
006202406X|1.0|First, let me say how excited I was when this book finally came out, I finished it in 1 day. I thought that the story and writing was awesome until the end chapters!!! It felt like you were taken on this great story of Tris and Tobias and their growth individually and together and then just shoved off a cliff!! To say that I am disappointed is an understatement!!! Definitely wish I had some truth serum and could change the ending to what I wanted it to be. The ending just wasn't fit for Tris or Tobias!!
B00BKZUVGM|5.0|Firstly I am so so sad this series is now over, I'm really going to miss Tobias and Tris. Now that I've said that Ms Roth has done something wonderful here. This book had me on the edge of my seat the entire way through. I am certain that there will be many people that are unhappy with the ending however I am not one of them. Tobias and Tris have stayed true to their characters the entire way through the series, there was never the 'sell out' moment that so many YA Authors seem to stoop to and for that I am thankful to the author. While the ending, for me is sad, I felt as though it was very, very true to the story and to the people involved. Again, this is a brilliant series with a final novel that is strong, engaging and well written. Go read it!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is sooooo cool .........as sooon as i turned on my kindle i saw the ad. Clicked on it right away
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|I like this game better than the first one.  The choice between the light and dark sides is great.  Challenging but not so difficult kids can't play it.
B001BANK32|5.0|I could read this book a thousand times. King draws such great pictures with his words I feel like I am right the there.
B002C6A6N6|5.0|When I was a kid growing up we only had one tv, and mom did all she could to keep a roof over mine and my brothers head. So when it came to what to watch mom always had the final say. Well every Friday night it was Dr. Quinn. I would sit there with her and watch it every week. When I saw this set it brought back all those memories of sitting there with mom.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Awesome series, can't wait for Season 4!  Highly recommend for someone who is looking for some violent raunchy good tv!!
B005PR422K|5.0|Absolutely a must read for all managers, employees, students and most importantly the self employed. Clear and easy to read factual and modest I think with so much useful stuff.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Fun game, but when I did the most recent update it stole my coins, went from 211 coins to 189.
0694011479|5.0|Great book. Condition was as promised. Other than a small crease on the first page the book was great. Used it to replace a lost library book and got it for a reasonable price.
B003M70O5O|5.0|I know this is supposed to be about season 2, which was awesome by the way, but what a bummer it was when I finished the last episode of season 4 and found out that season 5 was not available for Amazon Prime accounts.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Can be vexing at times, but fair if you take your time to really look at the puzzles.  Looks can be deceiving at times.
B005UT29Z0|5.0|WARNING: Without at least a basic understanding of finance, this film will be kinda boring.<br /><br />The pre-requisite to really enjoy this film is that you should be interested in finance. On the other hand if you are at all interested in economics or the financial markets then you will find this film fascinating! The more that you understand the more you will enjoy the film.<br /><br />The acting is great!! Kevin Spacey is so great. And I loved Zachary Quinto! In response to the other comment this film is anything but generic! It takes a situation that wasn't quite filled with classical action and turns it into an exciting, intellectual film!
B00003CXIP|5.0|This movie is absolutely engrossing.  Four boys who are best friends hear about a dead body deep in the woods along the railroad tracks and decide to go see it.  This isn't a scary movie, it's an in-depth look at the friendships among these boys and how they view life.  It is a sensitive, uplifting story with a great soundtrack.  Anyone who watches it until the credits roll and doesn't shed a tear, well, I would be very surprised to hear about them.  Wil Wheaton, River Phoenix, Jerry O'Connell, Corey Feldman, Kiefer Sutherland and an extremely young John Cusack are just part of the cast.  You really should see this film!
055358202X|4.0|I bought this for my boyfriend he has read all the book. He says this 1 is not as good as the last book but he hasn't put it down yet...:)
B00DJWV11I|4.0|Great read! a spin off from the traditional female POV, This book is from the male POV. Such insight In the male psyche! Wow. Do men really think that way? This book tells how a man whore a.k.a. Drew, falls hard for Kate. Never fallen in love, the book has him narrate his story on falling in love with Kate. It almost reads like a movie; he also reminded me of Barney Stinson, from HIMYM (Neil Patrick Harris). Entertaining, hot, and very funny book. Definitely recommend. It wasn't a grabber for me; I was able to put it down and pick up later, perhaps because in the end, although Drew was a nice enough guy, I wasn't convinced he wanted Kate because he LOVED Her, or if he just wanted to WIN Kate. Idk. Still, I definitely recommend this book ;).
B00CHMBQRA|5.0|I had not heard about this movie, but I ordered it because I like the actors.  The movies was GREAT!  Thanks, Amazon!
B0059XTUB8|4.0|This performance erases all doubts about the talent of Michelle Williams!  She transforms into Marilyn Monroe from her first moment in this film until closing credits.  This movie was based on a book by Colin Clark, a crew member on \\"The Prince and The Showgirl\\" who became a \\"close friend\\" to Marilyn (I don't think we'll ever know specifically what that means knowing how her fragile ego needed stoking at every turn) on the making of the movie.  Marilyn had just married Arthur Miller and had signed onto making a movie with Lawrence Olivier to prove to the world, and to herself, that she really was a great actress.  The acting, the scenery, the story itself all meld to give you a glimpse into what her world looked like.  It's worth the trip.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|The systematic law of learning is applied in Pams book. In order for one to have real knowledge rather than just belief first question the principle; second, you must take activity in the principle and by experiencing the action or the &#34;cause and effect&#34; of the principle you learn by experience. Thirdly, you move to a knowledge about, rather than a belief in the principle, for the law of attraction and its workings become yours through experience.<br />Remember that you simply overcome one law by counterbalancing it with another. Nothing escapes the law of cause and effect, but there are many levels of the law, and one may use laws of the higher to overcome the laws of the lower.<br />Pam lays out a framework for those who wish to rise above the ordinary level of mere pawn...and become players who dominate their moods, emotions, impulses, and feelings. Creating for themselves new characters, qualities, and powers through which they overcome their environment.<br />Fall in with the law of attraction by understanding its movements. Operate instead of being its blind slave. A skilled swimmer will turn this way and that way rather than being carried around like a floating log, wise and fool, are both subject to law...fall in with the Law.<br /><br />Like to talk more about this? email me rboiar at yahoo

B00EUEWRUI|4.0|This is a well done collection with very good production.  This live \\"reunion\\" version of Purple was very good but doesn't match up to the original Mach 2.  Decent collection of songs both old and new and the performances are excellent...just don't expect \\"Made in Japan\\" because it is a far cry from that masterpiece.  Some of the new songs like \\"Perfect Strangers\\", \\"Knocking At Your Back Door\\" and \\"Under the Gun\\" are great live. Gillan is still a fine singer but it is clear that he has lost the ability to hit the unbelievable high notes as he does on \\"Made In Japan\\" and other earlier live recordings.  \\"Child in Time\\" is a huge disappointment for that reason.<br /><br />If you love DP by all means add this to your collection.  If you are just beginning to gain interest in the band, I would suggest \\"Made In Japan\\" as a better introduction to Live DP.  This one is good; MIJ is a classic recorded at just the right time in the bands long history.  4 Stars!

B0098QBEXO|5.0|Watched Third Star a couple weeks ago, but it took me that long to actually sit down and write a review. I had to let some time pass and wait until the raw emotions this film provokes settle down a bit. I can say this – it’s one of the best movies I have seen this year, but I will admit that not everyone will like it.<br /><br />Basically, if you are looking for a an easy, switch your brain off and laugh out loud movie , walk away. Third Star is anything but easy, though it has some funny moments. If you are looking for two hours of eye popping non-stop action, chose something else to watch. But if you want a movie that grabs you and takes you on an emotional roller coaster, a movie that makes you laugh and cry and hurt with its characters, a movie that leaves you with many things to think about once it’s over – by all means, buy Third Star.<br /><br />The main premise is common enough: four childhood friends – James (Benedict Cumberbatch), Davy (Tom Burke), Bill (Adam Robertson) and Miles (JJ Feild) embark on a road trip to James’s favorite place on Earth – Barafundle Bay in Pembrokeshire, Wales. But this is where this trip differs from countless other road trip movies. James is terminally ill with cancer and his friends decided to organize this trip as their last adventure together. This is not a spoiler. In fact the movie starts with James saying “I am 29 today. I won’t be 30.”<br /><br />So this movie is a road trip, yes, but one that is also a goodbye –  goodbye to a friend, to childhood memories, to dreams not fulfilled and paths not taken. And while all four of the protagonists do their best to ignore the elephant in the room (James’ sickness), they will have to face it eventually, as they will have to face their own shortcomings and lost dreams.<br /><br />It is hard to describe this movie. Yes it is sad and the ending is hearth-wrenching and had me really crying, which not a lot of movies do. But you know what? It’s also filled with beauty and subtle humor and you can really see how much those four care about each other.<br /><br />To me, this is what this movie is about – love. Those four friends really love each other and they genuinely care about James or they would never be able to make the decision they made at the end of the movie. And they all love life and see the beauty in the little things around them.<br /><br />All four actors gave exceptional performances for Third Star. Nothing is overplayed or heavy-handed. I believe them when I watch them interact on screen. I forget that it’s Benedict Cumberbatch and JJ Feild, instead I only see James and Miles. That is the highest praise you can give an actor.<br /><br />But most importantly for me at least, this movie made me think. We all have dreams and things we want to do eventually, one day, when we have time. And after a while, like James says, “all those daydreams become fantasies rather than possibilities.” Well what if there is no more time? What if the next day is your last one? What would you see when you look back at your life? What happened to all those possibilities and dreams?<br /><br />This movie made me think about what I really want to do with my life. And you know what? I don’t want my dreams to become mere fantasies. I want to fulfill them, even if it will be hard work. So for this realization I must thank director Hattie Dalton and Western Edge Pictures and the main actors.<br /><br />And for those who want to spend two hours with a good movie that makes you sympathize with its characters and think about life and death, watch Third Star. It’s available for download from Amazon or on ITunes.h beauty and subtle humor and you can really see how much those four care about each other.<br /><br />To me, this is what this movie is about – love.

B008602KQI|5.0|This movie gives you a little bit of everything- happy, sad, excited, scared, terrified. It would be sad if this is what the world came to this. I would purchase from this company again and it arrived on time.
B001BANK32|5.0|Read this when I was a teen and wanted to reread! Great book. Make sure to read Dr Sleep after you read this!
0451419243|5.0|Thank you Ken Follet .Even though my heart broke with every character ion this long, marvelous novel, I look forward to the last of the trilogy..
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I even tried to fraction out the time I gave myself to read it so that I wouldn't reach the end too soon.  Didn't even feel like picking up my next book waiting.  I wanted to make this book last.  Thanks Mr. King for another riveting read filled with characters you love and hate and wonderful revenge and surprises.
B000I3PERS|4.0|Very sad movie that has a nice twist and a don't give up message. I would purchase again and it arrived on time.
B002HFP0QU|5.0|Purchased this CD at a great price and began to wait for its arrival with much anticipation.  Surprise!  CD arrived so fast I thought that they must have shipped it on the very next jet plane out of town!  Popped it in my car's CD player and got so excited I almost pulled over and got out to dance.  Love these CDs (set of two).  They have all of my favorite songs and then some (40 in all, I think).  This was one of the best experiences that I've ever had on Amazon.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I must admit that I arrived a little late to the feast that is &#34;Once&#34;.  I had heard all of the hype surrounding this show, but simply disregarded it.  Then on a day with little in the way of entertainment to offer, I landed on the first season of &#34;Once&#34;.  I am now quite hopelessly hooked on this series.  All of the actors are great and each has a very important part (even the those you may only see for a short time) in the overall telling of this elaborately woven tale.  Adam Horowitz and Edward Kitsis are master at weaving all of these familiar tales into one seamless story.  But don't think for one second that you know this story, because Adam and Edward have a great many surprises for you!  I would never spoil such a great story by telling you even the tiniest of details, but I will strongly urge you to check it out if you haven't already.
B0063M22QO|4.0|For a free game it's fun to play and runs well without glitches. Some levels are very easy and some very hard.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|It ended up having more songs on there that I knew. It's a great album and has a nice consistant theme. It's good driving music. I would buy it again and it arrived on time.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so glad that Amazon finally got this game. It loaded so  easy rate this game number one in my life of games. It must be a new version it is better than the other one on my phone. Go Amazon.
B00F35BV64|5.0|You just can't go wrong with a good Star Trek movie.  If SciFi is your thing, then this is a movie for you.  Ben Cumberbatch is excellent as Kahn.  For all of you Trekkies of old, you will enjoy the role twists in this version.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Really helped to clear out the cache, as well as freeing up memory. I would like to end there, however they require more words before submitting the review. I just now remembered why I don't review more often.
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|Loved it! passed it on, waiting for the next season... I highly recommend to buy this! You can watch it over again...
B00475AYJQ|5.0|A continuation from the 'Name of the Wind'.  Good story development and characters that you can understand. I cannot wait for the next one.
0385351399|4.0|For anyone who thinks this book is farfetched, think again - example: Aaron's Inc. one of the nation's biggest rental businesses with 1,880 locations in 48 states, admitted that since 2008 it installed software to monitor customers' computer keystrokes and secretly watch them in their homes through the computers' webcams, collecting data from customers and capturing passwords, sensitive financial information and images of private intimate moments.  The company also stored the captured data on its servers and shared collected information with franchisees.<br />Note:  I gave this book 4 stars because of the topic, not for the brilliant writing.  It's an overhyped, average contemporary book, but the subject is of utmost importance.
B003M70O5O|5.0|Excellent series with very good writing. If you caught season 1 you were left craving so much more especially questions that hadn't been answered
B000TCEU4Q|5.0|Bought this for my hubby to play Aces High II online.  He loves it.  It just recently had a problem with corroded variable resistor.  He put it under the microscope and cleaned it off and it works fine again.  We had it for at least a year and a half before it started having the problem.  I'd buy it for him again.
B005FFW46S|5.0|Terry Pratchett is phenomenal in the ability to create alternate realities out of what you go into as a 'normal' life.
B009WUAK2M|3.0|You will need two bowls of popcorn for this movie! The cameos make the movie worth watching for old school action junkies like<br />Me!
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I wish someone could give me back the last five hours of my life, but it's not possible. Honestly, I deeply enjoyed the first two books, despite them being a bit excessive in their wordiness at times and having a few continuity issues, but I can't say the same for allegiant. It had more plot holes than fishnet tights, and it felt like the writing, or the writer, had bit more than they it/they could chew. It's one thing to speak of a small, contained city, and explain their particular issues. But to suddenly open up a whole box of assorted revolutionary concepts and problematic situations, and explain none of them,nor give any semblance of a satisfactory resolution? Nah. That's lazy writing.<br /><br />AND HERE IS A SPOILER*******<br /><br />I don't think her death was pointless, I think it made sense, it just felt too much like I was trying to be emotionally blackmailed or something, after sticking with her through so many death defying situations. Maybe the point was to show she was human and divergence didn't make her so unique as to give her immortality, but it felt overwrought and disappointing. Both predictable and boring.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|So let me just say the reason I bought the first book Divergent was because my friends wouldn't shut up about it...and now I know why...the series was great. I read all three in three days.<br /><br />SPOILER AHEAD-if you haven't read the whole book stop reading my review<br /><br />The reason it's 4 stars is because Tris was an amazing character, and I was crying when she died. Sorry but I'm a crybaby when it comes to love. I wanted Tris and  Tobias to get married, but anyone who read the book knows that they don't. :'(
B0010SKUYM|5.0|The story of a hapless youth trying to grow up and the fumbles along the way. I liked the storyline and the characters.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been waiting for this game to play with my friends. I am really enjoying it. Thanks for getting it.
B00E9ZFIMM|3.0|This app is what it says it is and developer has promised more features to come.  App def needs some customization options. Font, reminders,  date format, cloud sync. At this point in the game these are expected features. Most smartphones come with a notepad preinstalled and the feature sets tend to be more robust. That being said this app is light weight and quick. No uneeded permissions and is very low in memory usage and&nbsp;install size. The developer needs to add at least some basic features and maintain these traits. This app could be big. As it sits it might be useful to someone who is running a custom rom that does not include a notepad. Neat basic tool.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book would have received 5 stars from me, but the ending was incredibly abrupt and left me dissapointed and wanting more.<br /><br />The story was great, I really couldn't put it down. It's one of the few books I've read as of late that really captured me and held my attention the entire time. I found myself waking up in the middle of the night to read, it was that good. I just wish the author had taken more time to wrap up the story. It felt like she spent so much time developing the background and meat of the story and then BAM it's over. A frustrating end to a really intruging story!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This was an incredible book and the series an incredible journey. I couldn't put Allegiant down and read it in about 5 hours. At the end of this series I am full of many unexpected emotions and I tell myself...Be Brave.
006202406X|5.0|Wasn't sure what to expect with all the mixed opinions, people seemed to either love it or hate it.  Well, I LOVED it. It was a beautiful, heartrending story that clearly affects the reader and pushes them out of their comfort zone. Veronica Roth is such a great writer who is able to elicit powerful emotions from her readers. Definitely a must read!
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|It is handsome, nice, and slim.  We like the strap and the stand.  Provides only a little protection for Kindle.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Looks like it was in original wrap and arrived in great condition.  As for the show itself, it is a pretty good series and might pique the interest of those interested in drama during a fantasy era.
0062255657|5.0|Not being a hugely committed fantasy fan, I hadn't read a lot of Gaiman but know him to be an entertaining and thought-provoking writer who never provides a stock-standard plot. A friend bought me The Ocean At The End Of The Lane at one of Gaiman's personal appearances; I read the first page, second, then finished the chapter. And the next thing I remember I'd reached the end of the book with a feeling of extreme disappointment. I wanted it to go on forever but, like most good things, it ended far too quickly. Please Neil, more books. Faster, faster, please.
B004I744AS|5.0|This dictionary works perfectly on my Kindle Fire. It is easy to use, has games, a Thesaurus, and other &quot;goodies.&quot;  I love that it also has an Encyclopedia included. I use this app throughout the day. If you have children in school this app would be perfect for homework. This app is easy to download, easy to use, and works perfectly on my Kindle Fire!
006202406X|5.0|I personally loved this series! Actually enjoyed it even more than the hunger games!<br />The world she created over the span of the 3 books was incredible. The story line was wonderful though the ending of the series was disappointing it was still great!! :)<br />Love, love, love it!
0553103547|5.0|This book arrived in excellent condition.  I have yet to read it, but there is no damage to the book itself, so I am very pleased with this purchase.

B00EUS9JF0|1.0|I was ON MY WAY TO WORK, wearing my ALLIGATOR shoes and thinking about<br />the EARLY DAYS. As I was driving, I spotted a young girl dressed in paisley.<br />I was LOOKING AT HER, reminiscing about Penny Lane, wondering if or when<br />Paul McCartney would ever release a NEW album that EVERYBODY OUT THERE<br />could APPRECIATE.<br />As I continued down the ROAD, I heard a NEW track on the radio.<br />It was just so-so, his once great voice sounded thin and the lyrics<br />it TURNED OUT, were weak. I wondered if radio would continue to play it,<br />or SAVE US from mediocrity.Having been disappointed with his last few records,<br />I CAN BET I won't be singing HOSANNA when I hear the rest of the NEW record.<br />Someone please GET ME OUT OF HERE.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Lets just say that I wasn't that keen about this book when I read the other reviews. A lot of them gave low ratings, something about the ending and how they will never read Veronica Roth's book ever again. As I read and re-read the reviews when I am half-way through the book, I couldn't suppress my curiosity any longer and just flip (on my kindle) to the epilogue, read the first page, and brace myself for the worst. And still drop my kindle in shock. I was tempted to give it a 1-star then, and drafted a rubbish biased review in my disbelief and maybe anger. I got so mad that I didn't continue reading the book that night.<br /><br />Well, on the next day I changed my mind and decided that I want to know how did 'it' (I don't want to reveal any spoilers) happen. So I continued reading it. I found out what happen, in detail. But instead of being more angry like I thought I would be, I got slightly teary and my anger ebbed away (partially).<br /><br />However I still understand that a lot of people are pretty upset about the ending. Well, try to think about it this way instead of giving it a 1-star, still angry at Veronica and swearing to never read her books again. There are other parts of the book that is really, well, good also. I like Veronica Roth's setting-building ability, about whats outside the fence. I also liked the character growth (though I would prefer not having the characters die so quickly). Also, there are a lot of really good philosophies about love, sacrifice, friendship and humanity. There is even something good in the ending; learning about true love and how the world really is. I'm not trying to be philosophic, but these can really help with our thinking in our lives.<br /><br />Veronica Roth, I really love your writing style. You are an author with much potential. After I finish this book I really wanted to give this a 5-star rating, but I know that a really important rule as a author is to at least fulfill most hope that the majority of the readers have in a book. I don't really think the ending is really what most readers hope for (Certainly not what I hoped for, just that how Veronica Roth delivered it soften the blow). There is also a line between reality and too much of that in storytelling. Well, since this book is targeted towards Young Adults, I think you should not care about the reality part too much, and just care more about the romance. Therefore this book for the ending, most Teens reader are not fairing very well (maybe I'm an exception). So... I am giving this a four stars because I think you can improve on that. Try not to kill too many characters in your next book/series (I'm still looking forward to it!). I mean, disabling works too, and probably even better than killing.<br /><br />P.S. To other readers who loved Divergent and Insurgent, read Allegiant. But please please pleasee be more observative about everything in the whole book, and don't just completely judge that book by the ending and be biased. (Not saying you shouldn't judge it by its ending, just not completely)
B007SYWFRM|5.0|The game is cute and fun until your vested in it then it wants you to purchase acorns and drags out days and days between at all. So, if you don't make a cash purchase all you can do is collect coins. Because the more  lnything all you end up doing is collecting coins for weeks because it wants 15,000,000 just for the same little plot of land that was 15,000 to start. So many things you have to purchase with acorns but they disappear I have won 100's of them on there scate game but it stole my acorns before I could buy anything. I just broke down and bought 2 small bundles and they took my money for 2 and only gave me one. I a m so mad i could scream.<br />You have to wait 10 hours between babies hatches, because it wants you to spend $20 a pop just to unlock the 2 other nests. When you first start you could have babies every 3 mins but like I said now it takes 10-15 hours in the incubator.it is started asking for acorns for $4.99 for mates and $14.99 to expand.<br />But the first few weeks its fun but then its discouraging. Graphic and tech problems all through it. But fun the first few weeks. Oh yes,customer support...I have been sending them help request viahhhhhhhhh emails and not one answer or help. Oh yes as for visiting and getting hearts it does the samething plus but it locks you out eo you can only visit once in a 24 hour period. Then they want 1,000 of hearts.<br />As for Dino world it won't let me expand. Takes my coins then nothing. I sent an email and it doesnt work. Then I got my grandsons to get the app and even though I am using the same connection we can't visit on another. They dont fix problems nor do they care. It a eye candy rip off.

B00BD99JMW|1.0|This book was an absolute epic failure. The majority of this book was slow moving and ended horribly.  I loved the first two books, even though I could begin to see where the author was going to go with the third book by the ending of the second.  However, I was totally unprepared and shocked by the ridiculous and senseless turn of events with a main character. I felt it was unnecessary and a very cheap way to end the story. It didn't even make sense and was poorly written.  On top of that, I found this book to be extremely repetitive and boring.  It was like the plot just kept repeating itself.  The characters just kept fighting to escape one group of controlling nut jobs after another. I began to lose sight of what the point and plot actually were. This book did not have the same flow and engaging, exciting dialogue of the prior two novels.  This could have been an amazing end to an otherwise fantastic series. Unfortunately, Ms. Roth shot herself in the foot with this one and will most likely lose many fans as a result of this. I'm actually returning this book - I'm that put-off. If I could return the other two at this point, I would. IT'S THAT BAD. If and when this is series is made into a movie, I won't waste my time watching it.  Don't waste your time, energy, and money with this over-priced series.  Overall, I'm extremely let down by the author and the low quality product she put out.  Ms. Roth has lost my trust and faith in her ability to deliver a book that is cohesive and relevant to the storyline.  I won't be purchasing her work in the future.

B00E9ZFIMM|3.0|Nothing on notebooks and notebooks pro, but not too bad of an app so far.  On the Asus transformer the font has a bad case of the \\"jaggies\\" You need to set up anti alias to smooth out the font.  You need to have an onscreen menu button,  for not all phones/tablets display it along the bottom.  My keyboard has it yes,  but it doesn't do anything.  I can't seem to change the title inside the note itself.  (this is being written with the app)  and I think that's about it.<br /><br /> Smooth your font<br />Add more features, rename, export, import, just to name a few.<br />Include the menu icon in your app.  Not every device has an external one.  Some tablets in particular do not have any interface buttons like home,  it's all on the control bar.<br />Have better graphics for the high res tablets, your title graphics are stretched and choppy looking in landscape mode<br />Have a free version for testing and bug workout then make a pro version with tons of features that people would want to buy.  As it stands I checked it out because it was FAOTD but would not buy it with notebook pro on my tablet<br /><br />As it stands there are far better notepad apps out there,  but it's not too bad,  I've seen worse so you get 3 stars,  one for trying,  one for the decent icon and one cause I',m in a good mood.  :P<br /><br />PS,  the name is actually taken,  Google notepad++ and you will see that it's taken by a really great notepad replacement. I use it for coding and everything else,  it's one neat notepad prog<br /><br />PPS. Google keep is a pain in the rear in my opinion, I guess I'm spoiled by the now defunct catch.com<br /><br />Edit: Fixed major typo thanks to swiftkey auto correct and added some more detail

B0089LOG02|5.0|I probably liked this better than I rated it. This follows the life of a young Immigrant girl who immigrates from Ireland with her family. Withing a short period she becomes orphaned and enters an orphanage. From there she is shipped out to the Mid-West to be &#34;adopted&#34; by a family who is in need of some form of assistance. Most are used as laborers or for child care in large families. We meet her in her 90's mentoring a teen-aged girl in foster care. This story goes back and forth between the woman from the orphan train and the girl's life in foster care. I found it intriguing! I had no idea such a thing as the Orphan Train existed so I like learning about it's place in our history. I would highly recommend reading it!
006202406X|5.0|Ugh. Apparently amazon didn't like my review. Basically, you can't just dismiss a book because people die. That's life! It's a great book. Does it rip at your emotions? Yes. But so does life. I loved the book. I have questions but it was great.

B00BD99JMW|3.0|**Contains no Spoilers**<br /><br />I loved the first two novels in the Divergent series, and have been looking forward to Allegiant for months. Roth once again completely uprooted the focus of the conflict to a new, unpredictable obstacle, which is something that I have both enjoyed and hated in the first two books. The major cliff hanger from the end of Insurgent is explained in the beginning, though it opens up a literal world of information that is only kind of addressed. Minor characters, such as Uriah, Christina, and Caleb, aren't really developed at all, and questions about them you may have been left with from the earlier novels weren't addressed. I thought that was one of the worst omissions in this novel. Tris and Tobias aren't the only characters whose lives and development is important in the earlier novels, but they are the only ones in this novel. And honestly, the dual POV rotating between them works in some ways, by illuminating more of Tobias's thoughts and character, but also ends up being very confusing because their voices are more similar than they should be. There were a number of questionable plot choices- things the characters were made to do to further the plot that weren't necessarily in keeping with their character, and situations that felt very contrived. I will say, though, I could have forgiven all of these things if it weren't for the ending. I was still just as captivated by Allegiant as I had been reading the first two novels, but while I have re-read the first two multiple times, studying them even, after this novel I don't have any desire to re-read them again.<br /><br />I think Roth is a very talented writer, but I can't say I enjoyed reading this book. I also can't say that I would recommend the trilogy to anyone, especially any of the young adults that I know. I think the people who will enjoy this book the most are those who weren't overly attached to the story or characters from the earlier novels. If you read them with a passing interest, you'll probably be able to do the same with this one. If, however, you fell in love with the characters and the story of the first two novels, you will be very disappointed with how it all wraps up.

0385351399|3.0|I used to love Dave Eggers.  I thought he had a really unique style, and intriguing subject matter... now he falls into the footsteps that Stephen King did and gets away with dumbed down in your face mindless dribble!<br /><br />Some parts of the book were intriguing.  He knows how to heighten suspense and intrigue when he has to, but then adds a bunch of unnecessary fodder that really does nothing for his characters or the reader.  If this book were about 200 pages shorter (which it really should be) then I might actually give this four stars for an entertaining book on a sub-par intellectual level.  It seems like he's catering towards the &#34;Bestseller&#34; crowd now, leaving little of value in his stories.  I hope he goes back to the early days of his writing but this was pretty disappointing on the whole.  Please don't pull an M. Night Shamalyan on us and write something that harkens back to the olden days.

B00FR3UZ8C|3.0|I like Andrea Bocelli. However, most of these songs are also on his Passione CD. Seems like buying the same CD.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I eagerly anticipated this release, counting down the days.  I grabbed it as soon as I was able and cleared my entire evening to devour it.  My daughter and I loved the first 2 books.  Are they the best written?  No, but the story was good and the characters were engaging so that made them worthwhile reads.<br />Starting early on in the book, I realized that the author seemed to have lost the &#34;voice&#34; of the story, the voice she used to tell the first 2 installments had disappeared.  Of course this can happen; authors grow and their voices often become more refined.  Not so with this book.  It was as if she had become bored with the story herself and just wanted to get it over with as quickly and conveniently as possible.  Several opportunities were presented for some interesting story developments and then just simply glossed over, kind of like the author thought, &#34;Well, I toyed with going in this direction but it would take too much work.  Let's just forget I ever brought that up.&#34;  That is frustrating.<br />As I moved on through the story, I stopped worrying about what had happened to the author's voice and started wondering  what had happened to her mind.  What was she thinking as she wrote this?  How could she possibly believe this would be a satisfying ending to the story?  Does she really think that the way the story ends leaves us wanting more from her?  A good trilogy often ends right where you don't want it to, on the cusp of new, wonderful adventures, possibilities unfolding, plenty of room for your imagination to wander.  This trilogy ended with every door you hoped might remain open sealed shut.  Tobias is becoming a politician?  Are you kidding me?  A politician?  I couldn't care less what happens from this day forward to any of the characters.  Tris is dead.  Tobias has gone into politics.  The rest have suffered similar, miserable fates.  Who wants to imagine what will become of any of them?<br />Ms. Roth, you lost it.  Maybe you lostinterest in your own story.  Maybe you lost your voice.  Maybe you lost your mind.  But one thing you have most certainly lost is a fan and the other reviews make it clear that I'm not the only one.  Now there's a movie coming out in the spring.  Who cares about that?  About the only thing I care about right now is that memory serum.  Anyone have a spare vial around?  I'd like to forget I started reading this trilogy in the first place.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is game has been around this long and they just got it. Come on man, Amazon should have pushed King to get this out much sooner.
B00E9ZFIMM|2.0|i downloaded this because of the pro on the title but it turns out to be very similar with the stock notepad that comes with my phone. this is very confusing, i dont see any special feature that is not found on my current free notepad app.
B007WEQ3K8|5.0|Enjoy training my brain. Fun and helpful. Makes you use those tired old brain cells and get those cells doing jumping Jack's for the brain.
B001TH16DI|5.0|What a bargain! We sat and watch all the movies in one day.So tremendously enjoyable!!! I thoroughly recommend the collection.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|This was a great game but ended too quickly. The hidden items were hidden better than most games like this. Really had to search. Played great on Kindle Fire HD! Really liking forward to a sequel. Just wish the story had been longer for the $2.99 I spent on upcoming it.
B008220C56|5.0|I absolutely loved this take on the Tolstoy classic.  It moves quickly, which if you've read the book you know that could be an issue in film.  The costumes and sets were fantastic, but the actors/actresses really make the story come alive.  Finally, I loved the combo pack because it allows me to share it with people while still retaining my digital copy to watch myself.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is wonderfully addictive and I am So glad this is finally offered (and free!) in the Kindle app store!
B004I744AS|5.0|Fast and accessible information arranged so most pertinent is the first displayed in bold print very easy to scan. I love it and use it just because I enjoy the format.

B007PVHMCG|3.0|I ordered this for my children as their upcoming Christmas gift and was slightly disappointed how small the packaging is on this set. The picture clearly shows it's a cube sized box but it's real small. Other than that, I'm happy I was able to buy one of these this year when last year, they sold out FAST!
1593275080|5.0|Ever since I was a kid, I enjoyed playing with LEGOs.  Day in and day out I would build whatever came to mind, take it apart, and then start anew.  Even now when I get a hold of LEGOs I can spend countless hours playing with them.<br /><br />When I first received my paperback copy of “Beautiful LEGO” in the mail, I was amazed by the quality of the book.  I instantly began flipping through the book and was amazed by how great the pictures looked.  The LEGO designs on the pages were so clear, vivid, and colorful.  While going through the book you can truly experience the infinite possibilities that LEGOs have to offer.  Some of my personal favorites were Heath Flor’s Smolny Cathedral and Aaron Williams’ Guardian Heavy.<br /><br />Going through the book really was an amazing experience.  There were LEGO creations that I never knew was possible.  Anyone at any age who enjoys LEGOs will love this book.

B000000YNY|5.0|Review based on 180 gram LP.<br /><br />This is the first recording of Bill Evans new trio after the death of his friend bassist Scott La Faro. It was also the first time that Bill Evans recorded a whole LP with ballads. Before this recording, Bill Evans on piano & Scott La Faro on bass were more of a duet with the drummer Paul Motian in the background. After Scott La Faro died, his replacement Chuck Israels plays behind & makes Bill Evans the master Soloist. The music was recorded in 1962 & remastered in 1990. 2 songs are written by Bill Evans, 2 songs from Tadd Dameron, a song by Rogers & Hammerstein, a song by Kern-Robin, & 3 other composers. Easy listening, kick back Jazz for evening reflections. Great recording for 1962 or the remastering of 1990 must of done wonders. Clean bass in the right channel, drums in the center, & piano in the left channel. Wide spacious sound.
006202406X|1.0|Everything amazon did was great!<br />But this book. I loved the first part but then... then...<br />There was no need for that death and if you read it you know what I'm talking about!<br />(don't read on if you haven't read this yet)<br />She was resistant to the death serum then she dies of gunshot wounds! That's. Just. Stupid.<br />I was barely able to finish the book after she died because it was a stupid, meaningless death. She could have lived and the story would have had the same impact.<br />Sure, some of Four's anguished thoughts were interesting but they were boring because at that point, I didn't care anymore.<br />I loved Divergent. I really liked Insurgent. And I loved this book until I realized what Tris was going to do. I she had to die, then it would have been okay. But she didn't have to die.<br />I would have given this book five stars if that hadn't happened. Now it has one. ONE. I can never be happy again because of this book! NEVER!<br />I can never trust a book or an author again. EVER!<br />I don't even know if I was to buy anymore of Roth's books after this because this ending was just stupid.<br /><br />Also, I'm going to add that I thought the POV changes could have been written a little better. They weren't very different in tone so it was hard getting used to the fact that Tobias was talking instead of Tris.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|GRRM, YOU HAD ME AT DRAGONS! This series is addicting. Be cautioned, if you have limited free time but are willing to give up television and sleep, you need to read this series! The books are even better than the show.
B00E9ZFIMM|2.0|This app is far from being worth any money as it stands. It is a decent, quick little note app, but feels incomplete. Font looks very rough, and the navigation isn't the greatest. Seems odd to have to back out of the note. There definitely needs to be some features added, but it is okay as FAOTD.
B001BS3G6A|4.0|This review is based on both the LP & CD versions.<br /><br />My record player, the Rega Plannar 3, only plays 33-1/3 LPs. Nowhere does it state on Amazon.com that this 12 inch LP is a 45 RPM record. The LP cover also doesn't state the RPM, only the record label itself states 45 RPM. Therefore I had to open the shipping carton, then the outside wrap, & then take the LP out of the inner cover before the RPM was known. Imagine my surprise when I went to play the LP. I bought the LP from a secondary Amazon supplier. I wrote them for a RA #. I read somewhere that there were 45 RPM 12 inch LPs for sale but you would think the record companies & web sites would state the RPM. Bummer, I don't want a CD with this recording because I wanted to hear a warm & spacious tone that only a LP can give to Jazz. I really wanted to have a whole LP collection of Melody Gardot's works.<br /><br />I got the CD through Amazon direct with other goods to get free freight. I started my collection of Melody Gardot with her 3rd recording \\"My One & Only Thrill\\" with her very interesting soft sexy singing voice & laid back Jazz which captured me. Melody's 2nd recording, this CD, if you count the \\"Bedroom Sessions\\" as the first, is more Blues rather than Jazz. Therefore typical to the Blues style the words have repetitive reframes which simplify the story of the song but put the force of emotion into the expression of the singing. I prefer Jazz rather than Blues because of the more open & freedom of the structure of the music. Melody does a good job show casing the Blues style with her singing & guitar work. The backup musicians are top rate. The only problem I have with this recording is that her singing sounds like Norah Jones which I don't hear in her newer recordings. The 4th recording \\"The Absence\\" moves into the Caribbean & South American Jazz scene. This CD is but a beginning to a fabulous woman that changes her style with each recording.<br /><br />Some reviews in her newer recordings complain that she needs to return to the style of this CD \\"Worrisome Heart\\". I totally disagree & hope to see Melody move on with her talent.<br /><br />Keep up the good work Melody.plain that she needs to return to the style of this CD \\"Worrisome Heart\\". I totally disagree & hope to see Melody move on with her talent.<br /><br />Keep up the good work Melody.
B00498YZH8|2.0|In spite of the convincing acting, I found the story line relentlessly dreary and foreboding. I am a Jennifer Lawrence fan--it was the script & setting that were a drag!
B00FXEL00W|5.0|A great novel by Kristen Zimmer filled with love, secrets, and truly finding yourself. The characters feel so real, Zimmer mixes in some humor to convey their ages as well. I read this in one day and truly felt the emotions of the characters. I can't wait to see what the author is writing next.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|As i dont have a SMART tv, this served the purpose of apps for youtube, Netlifx.<br />for other sites its little slow as it has to pull the streaming from the computer. But I liked it.<br />May be google should add more Apps to chromecast.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Loved the story line.  Interweaving the lives of these women became very interesting throughout the book.  Looking forward to reading more of Ms. Moriarty's writings.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I really loved divergent, insurgent, and the beginning of allegiance, but I hate how she ends the series! It makes me question whether she really is a good author or not. At this point, I believe ending the book the way she did does not make her we like a bad author but a heartless soul who does not deserve to have published three books. I'm sorry, Veronica, but your book broke my heart and destroyed my hopes and possibly my love to read. I can no longer consider you an author because of the lack of common sense shown through the emotions. I still have one question for Mrs. Roth, though. What made you feel you needed to end the series the way you did? I would think you would be smart enough to realize it would cause mixed reactions from the fandom.
B007T8BYWE|5.0|I absolutely love this game.  The only problem with it is its hard to stop playing once you start.  If you like logic problems then you will love this game.
B007XC9BSK|5.0|Perfect for my little grandson for Christmas.  He loves cars and when they are this small they need storage. What a cool storage setup

B0034G4OYA|5.0|This is really a cute movie and I love to watch it as one of my go to Halloween movies...along with the Exorcist and Nightmare  on Elm Street! ;)
B00BD99JMW|4.0|This book was just as great as the other two. I am sick and tired of fans giving it 1 or 2 stars because the ending wasn't what any of us would have wanted. You know what? It was a fitting end to the legacy that was Tris. They were in the middle of a war. The epilogue was beautifully written and gave a truly Dauntless send off. I would highly recommend this book for someone who loves Divergent and Insurgent, and a face-paced emotional ride. This was a fitting ending to the series. Some people should wait to write their reviews until they get their emotions in check. Trashing the book because you are sad or angry is not fair. Doesn't deserve the hate.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app, it is absolutely my favorite. I love it when I have time pull out my Kindle and admire all the pins!

B00BD99JMW|2.0|I was very disappointed in this book - and not just for the kneejerk reason that everyone else is discussing. I thought that the entire book was a letdown. I felt that there are actually pretty significant character continuity issues, storyline flaws, and a serious issue with the dual point of view when the voices are the same. Overall the book was much slower than the other two. It had less action that Divergent, the exact same couple drama between Tris and Four as Insurgent, and nothing redeeming on its own.<br /><br />This review contains spoilers.<br /><br />*********************<br />First, the big one: Yes, like everyone else, I hated the decision to kill Tris. But for me, it's not just because Tris died. It's more how and WHY the decision was to kill her. I feel like Veronica Roth felt that the only way she could show that Tris was selfless was to kill her off - which isn't true. To me, it felt like The Matrix where they tried to fit Neo as the modern day Jesus Christ. Tris is so special that the death serum doesn't work on her! The only person in the world who is like that. Then she is murdered by David because he wants the system on the way that it was. And she sacrificed herself to save the world! How selfless! (Except was it really, when it was because she didn't want her brother to die because she felt he was doing it for the wrong reasons so she would feel guilty. Doesn't her feelings - not wanting to feel guilty - make it selfish?)  It was just too contrived. I know that Roth is a Christian, but I never felt that it dictated her writing until this book.<br /><br />Second, let's talk character continuity. EVELYN spent years neglecting her son, proved to be power hungry after creating her factionless army to strike back against the faction system, but choose to give all that up after being emotionally blackmailed by Tobias? That seemed super contrived and not at all in character. She never showed any humanity in Insurgent or Allegiant before the end. Herchoice simply was not believable for the character.  MARCUS is another power hungry character who, when presented with an option to give up his power, said, \\"no, I'm the leader\\" and Joanna said, \\"no, you're not and I'm going to tell everyone\\" and then he just folded and went off into the sunset? The man who was built up as a power hungry monster for three books would not have done that without more resistance. Or force. Or violence. PETER has shown no remorse for anything he's done for 3 books (which includes attaching people while sleeping, trying to kill Tris, turning on his Faction, etc.)  but at the end he's so full of remorse that he chooses to take the memory serum and forget, in the hope that he would change? Not *once* had we seen even glimpses of remorse from him, so the total 180 degree remorse is totally out of character. No one changes 180 degrees in a matter of pages. You'd expect to see glimpses prior, so that the big change isn't completely out in left field. And even TRIS turns from someone with a strong sense of right and wrong to someone for whom the ends justify the means? Tris in Divergent would have said that wiping anyone's memory is morally wrong. Tris in Alligiant says wiping memories of those in her world are wrong, but in the government world is ok? And that's not character growth, because it's the opposite direction; it's lack of continuity.<br /><br />Third, if you are going to have dual points-of-view, you have to make sure that the storytellers sound different. Tris and Tobias have too similar a voice. Their voices were almost identical. It's frustrating to not realize who is talking because they have the same voice. Several times, I had to keep going back to see whose viewpoint I was on. (Something you never had to do for Jodi Picoult, who employs that tactic.) I get why you had to have Tobias' storytelling (since she was killing off Tris, someone had to finish the book) but you need distinct voice if you do that. Fail on Veronica Roth's part.<br /><br />Fourth, I felt this book (more than the others) had significant storyline flaws. The biggest to me is that they had already established that the Chicago Bureau was just ONE of several in the United States. Which means that just modifying the memories of the Chicago Bureau would do NOTHING because the experiment is still going on in other cities. And let's be honest, all the Government would do is send new people - with their memories - to Chicago to restore order and continue the experiment.  When leaders are assassinated, the government goes on with new leaders. And the little offhand comment about Peter at the end - wiping his memory didn't really change who he was and what he thought b/c the rougher parts came out again - would be true of the Chicago Bureau anyway. And as a total aside, people at the Bureau watching everyone's lives play out on TV - isn't that a little Hunger Games ripoff? And the ending, everyone is friends with Caleb? I don't see it. They hated him since he worked with Jeanne. People wanted him to sacrifice himself, he let Tris do it (no matter how it played out), Tris does, and they are ok with Calab? That makes no sense whatsoever. And this book takes place at least 200 years in the future (I calculated 8 generations by 25 years). The U.S. is apparently in shambles. The west is wild. And yet, no other country has conquered the U.S.? Unlikely. She appears to be going for realism with Tris's death, but disregards it with other issues. We'd have been better with a no-name government.  And we know that Tobias is not Divergent, and we know that he got Abnegation. Meaning that Tobias was Abnegation and selfless. Yet to prove that he wasn't genetically damaged, he is willing to hook up with people he doesn't even know for revenge, against Tris's comments? That's incredibly selfish. When he did it in Insurgent, the idea was that it was because it was his mother. Yet this time there is no reasonable explanation why he would be dosomething like that - which goes against his Abnegation selflessness that he was meant to be.<br /><br />Finally, Tris's mother. First, she just gets dropped off in Dauntless at age 15, and NO ONE notices? They re-did *everyone's* memory? (And apparently not that well, since in Insurgent, Tris was identified as second generation by the simulation). Second, even at the end of Divergent, when her mother knew that she was going to sacrifice herself for Tris, she is *still* telling lies to Tris? Who she knows is Divergent so possibly in danger going forward? NO MOTHER WOULD SO THAT. That may bother e more than anything else in the book. If her mother was trying to save the Divergent, the minute you know (or even suspect) that your daughter is Divergent, you save your child. (And similarly, why didn't Amar ever try to save Tobias if he knew Tobias was Divergent - even if he was wrong about that). And did her mother know about Divergents b/c she was one (as she told Tris), or because she was from outside and was saving them (so yet another lie she told Tris at the end of her life)?
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I love this game. It's the best one in the app store. The only drawback is that you only get 5 lives at a time. The levels are hard enough when you get to the higher stages without limiting the lives otherwise Candy Crush Saga rocks!!!
B00701QV0A|5.0|I realize I'm just joining the choir to sing the praises for this album, but it is a favorite of mine. The song \\"Eye in the Sky\\" is one of those songs that I can remember exactly where I was and what I was doing when I first heard it played on the radio. It made that big of an impact on me.  This song is among the most perfect pop songs ever and the rest of the album fits ideally with the song.<br /><br /> Alan Parsons Project exudes quality in everything they've recorded in my estimation.  The music is smooth pop rock with an arty influence.  Maybe not befitting the taste of rock aficionados who don't go for this lighter sort of fare, but if laid back dreamy listening is your ear candy then this should satisfy your musical sweet tooth.

B007WEQ3K8|2.0|The instructions are very sketchy for most games. There is no way to submit your answer and move to the next question on some games; some games won't even load. Sudoku forces the app to close when done, not even showing results. I agree with another reviewer that the new age yoga background is annoying, has too much glare, and ruins the whole app. Many screens are unreadable due to the font color. There should be a way to change it. A lot of the games do work, some don't, and some are inane.
B00DYEBM3I|5.0|Mazzy Star's new release is wonderful. The group still has their signature sound, but these new songs are no rehash of old material. Fresh new work. It's great to listen to them again.

B00ELU7A4E|1.0|I'm not writing to complain about this single, I'm writing to complain about Amazon.  I accidentally ordered this CD instead of Prism so I went to my orders and canceled it.  It said that the cancellation couldn't be guaranteed so I immediately had Amazon call me so that I could explain the situation and they could cancel it for me.  The woman on the phone told me she couldn't cancel even though I had just ordered it within 5 minutes.  She said it was because it was already in the shipping process.  So now I have to go through the return process.  This is an inconvenience that I believe Amazon could of taken care of by just canceling the order.  I've been an Amazon customer since 2006 and Amazon has always provided good service but I don't appreciate the service I got involving this CD.

I could really relate to the main character who I could connect to much more than heroines in other books that were popular at the time such as Bella from Twilight. There was adventure, romance and some fantasy elements. Fantastic read!

B00ARA4SLU|4.0|This movie was very interesting because of all that Hitchcock went through to make the movie \\"Pycho\\", since no movie production wanted to handle it back in 1960 because it was too horrifying, he had to mortgage his estate to make the movie.  Good storyline and excellent performance by Anthony Hopkins and Helen Mirren.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This contemporary sci-fi tale is the classic story of a flawed hero with the twist that he is only 6 years old at the beginning of the book. There is lots of action for space opera fans but it is much more than battle scenes. Manipulation and envy, bullying and ambition are done to and done by the young protagonist when he is selected for an elite military training program.  It's a cautionary tale with an unexpected ending. Not for very young children.

B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Nice to see Candy Crush finally available on my kindle.  I'm not sure what all the hype was about, but it's a great way to kill some extra time.
B000A7DVR2|4.0|I purchased this movie because I had always heard it referenced and had to see what the fuss was all about. I won't ruin it but it's pretty funny and everyone should see it once.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|lots of fun to play. need more rooms to escape from. one thing I don't like is if you happen to leave the room. on accident or on purpose. all progress is lost and you have to start over. boy a real problem just annoying.  My granddaughters like to help and had great thoughts.<br />Want more rooms
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game!! Very addicting! I don't know if this is a good thing or not. I know that many people are addicted to it.
B004TI1WME|3.0|it's your normal calculator.  Good to have but my phone has one and I use that more so than I do this one on my kindle.  But it's a great backup if I don't have my phone near me :)
B00866JL96|4.0|For everyone out there who isn't a Nicholas Sparks fan, I hope you'll give this title a try. The movie follows the book pretty closely, except the movie adds a dash more handsomeness than I had pictured. (Not complaining.). I am usually not a Nicholas Sparks fan, but I truly enjoyed this book as it combined a sense if realness to the situation, but with those dreamy characters for which we can feel love, admiration, hate, etc.  Essentially, without spoiling too much, a young man who previously served in the military overseas has taken himself on a cross-country journey to find himself, as well as the person he believes brought him the luck that has saved his life. He is accompanied by his dog , Zeus, who is the subject of humor, heroism, and intelligence in the story. Eventually, he comes upon a canine training farm where he seeks a job, but he's also there for other reasons. Read or watch to find out if this story seems to interest you!

B008RKIACK|5.0|One of my all time cult classic movies.  Great scenes all over NY from subways to parks to streets.  Story is loosely based on the 300 concept.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very addictive and lots of fun.  Great that there is a little story to go along with it.  Lots of fun to play against family and friends.  So glad I can have it on kindle now.
B0050PYNP8|3.0|OVERVIEW:  The 2011 science-fiction/comedy, “Paul,” was directed by Greg Mottola and co-written by Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, and Seth Rogen.  Inspired by their mutual adoration for Steven Spielberg’s “E.T. the Extra Terrestrial” and “Close Encounters of the Third Kind,” Pegg and Frost first conceived the premise for “Paul” while on the set of “Shaun of the Dead” in 2003.  “Paul” allowed its creators the opportunity to incorporate numerous references from their favorite sci-fi movies.  Steven Spielberg, himself, makes a cameo appearance in the film during a “flashback to the 80s” scene; his voice is heard discussing ideas for the upcoming release of “E.T. the Extra Terrestrial,” retroactively insinuating that Paul, the alien, was the actual inspiration for E.T.  The film has been received positively by critics and audiences alike; it currently holds a 71% rating from Rotten Tomatoes.  Personally, I wouldn’t count “Paul” among its writers’ best or funniest works (I’d name “Hot Fuzz as #1), but I do think it fits in well with Pegg and Frost’s previous comedies.  What sets “Paul” apart is that it utilizes a more dynamic storyline than is generally used by its creators.  In some ways, the more intricate plotting grants “Paul” greater distinction and credit as a film than, say, “Shaun of the Dead,” but this element also detracts from the ‘silliness’ Pegg and Frost fans have come to expect from their movies.  All-in-all, I’m happy to have “Paul” in my collection of DVDs.<br /><br />STARRING ROLES:  Seth Rogen as the voice of Paul, Simon Pegg as Graeme Willy, Nick Frost as Clive Gollings, Kristen Wiig as Ruth Buggs, Jason Bateman as Special Agent Lorenzo Zoil, Bill Hader as Agent Haggard, Jane Lynch as Pat Stevens, Blythe Danner as Tara Walton, Joe Lo Truglio as Agent O’Reilly, David Koechner as Gus, Sigourney Weaver as “The Big Guy,” Jeffrey Tambor as famous sci-fi writer Adam Shadowchild, and John Carroll Lynch as Moses Buggs.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:  (1-disc/Unrated/214-min. Run-Time/ASIN:  B0050PYNP8)<br />▪  Filmmakers’ Commentary with Greg Mottola, Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, Bill Hader, and Nira Park<br />▪  Bloopers<br />▪  The Evolution of Paul<br />▪  Simon’s Silly Faces<br />▪  Who the Hell is Adam Shadowchild?<br />▪  Galleries and Credits<br /><br />SUMMARY:  For the better part of a century, the U.S. government has been holding an extraterrestrial by the name of Paul as a hostage.  We learn that many of the 20th Century’s greatest technological advancements were not the products of humans at all, but were rather the fruits of Paul’s willingness to share information with his captors in exchange for being allowed to live.  When Paul’s “usefulness” runs dry, the government decides to kill him in order to harvest his brain and, hopefully, discover how to incorporate some of Paul’s unique physical abilities (invisibility camouflage and healing powers) into the human genome.  With the help of a friend inside the agency, Paul contacts his home planet to send a rescue ship to Earth; he flees the secret government base in a stolen vehicle.<br /><br />Two British tourists, Graeme and Clive, are on an RV trip visiting some of the U.S.’s most famous ‘close-encounter’ sites.  When Paul speeds past the RV, then crashes, Graeme and Clive pull over to check on the motorist.  Fascinated at the chance to meet a real alien, Graeme offers Paul a ride.  The trio stops for a layover at Moses Buggs’ RV park; Moses and his daughter, Ruth (who wears an eye-patch to conceal a blind eye), are devout fundamentalist Christians.<br /><br />Special Agent Lorenzo Zoil arrives at the scene of Paul’s wrecked vehicle.  He informs his boss, “The Big Guy,” that he’s picked up Paul’s trail; in order to resolve the matter as quickly and quietly as possible, “The Big Guy” attaches two additional agents, Haggard and O’Reilly, to the case.<br /><br />While collecting the campers’ fee, Ruth engages in a heated theological debate aboard Clive and Graeme’s RV.  After losing patience with Ruth’s ignorance, Paul reveals himself to her and later, via telepathy, shares his knowledge of the universe with Ruth.  When Moses discovers Paul, he presumes him to be a demon and chases the campers out of the park with his shotgun.  Ruth, torn between her father’s faith and knowledge of the outside world, is now along for the ride in the RV; Paul uses his healing powers to repair Ruth’s eye and, in the process, gains her trust.<br /><br />The remainder of the movie centers around concealing Paul from the public, evading the agents pursuing Paul, and making it to the rendezvous point so that Paul may be rescued.  There are a lot of laughs, some ‘eye-opening’ moments, and a few twists along the way, so I won’t spoil anything!e.<br /><br />While collecting the campers’ fee, Ruth engages in a heated theological debate aboard Clive and Graeme’s RV.

B00F0N7JUG|5.0|Pacific Rim  was one of my personal favorite films of this year, Giant robots VS Giant Kaiju, Directed By Guillermo del Toro= WIN. The set itself is what you'd expect in terms of extra's, in fact I was surprise at the detail and length of everything included. Guillermo del Toro's  solo commentary on the film was great and anyone interested in the genre will be pleased. The packaging is simple but cool for the price, what would look like a statue from the outside is more of a hollow disc holder. Nice detail, again for the price. It's a nice piece for the shelf. GET IT!
1250038820|5.0|I've been following the blog for a while and am always caught off guard, surprised, and enlightened by it.  I am thrilled it's now a book. I can hold it. And lend it to friends who will never give it back.  And..that's OK.
B009RX7IX8|5.0|Excellent show! The chemistry among the cast is tremedous. One of the best shows on tv. Plus, the blooper reel makes the dvd worth every penny!
B004EPZ070|4.0|I thought this was a good movie, and a pretty honest one in comparison to most romantic comedies. I did not read the book, so I can't attest to it's accuracy in comparison, but the movie alone was pretty touching and I think most of us have experienced some of the same dilemmas as those<br />present in the movie.
B00D7NWTSI|4.0|I personally liked the film  and every time I watched it,I seen more things that explained most of the problems I had with it in the theater. The Mandarin twist didn't bother me even though I would've preferred the more iconic approach.  With that being said  I was disappointed to find out upon viewing the extras that one of the parts I wanted to see most ( A detailed look at the armors that were in the film ) was locked away behind a IOS ( Apple, Ipad, Iphone etc ) ONLY app. The Second Screen feature which allows you to look at other parts of the disc. Ive used Second Screen before on my android tablet for most recent Spider-Man film but because I don't have an IOS device I'm screwed out of features that could have been used with IOS as well as Android. The packaging has a very nice textured slip cover ( I like that ) which has the theme of being burned and scorched and vibrant colors. Pretty cool other then the issue I had, I say pick it up.
B007IK44CK|4.0|The latest in the MI series doesn't disappoint.  Tom Cruise is equally as good in this one as the previous MIs.  Some of the story line drags, but the movie is still well worth the time.
B00DU77QP2|5.0|Great plot. Very suspenseful, which had me speed reading most of it to see what happened next. I kept expecting/hoping to find a connection between the characters from the prequel and the characters from this one. I was angered by the revalation of Clary and Jace being siblings and am hoping to find some kind of loophole in one of the sequels. Looking forward to City of Ashes.
B005LAIHGI|3.0|Ok, I don't mind crude comedy, but I think Sacha Baron Cohen lacks the cleverness needed to pull it off without grossing people out.  He intends to be funny solely by offending people, and I think that is sad.  This movie is well along the lines of Borat, so if you liked that movie enough to buy it, then buy this one.  Otherwise, rent it and never watch again.
B00003CXSM|1.0|THE MOVIE HAD ONE SCRATCH THAT MADE ONE PART OF THE MOVIE SKIP. OTHER THEN THAT THE MOVIE WAS GOOD
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I am so surprised at all the low ratings.  No, I didn't like the ending of the book, yes, it was heart-breaking, but it was honest, emotional, and completely valid.  I commend Ms. Roth for writing a book that touches so many emotionally even if it wasn't the ending the masses wanted.
B004P8A7J2|5.0|The picture quality and sound were great. The system didnt time out with a spinning cog as it sometimes does. I had wanted to see this movie for a while- good flick!
B008602KQI|4.0|I was addicted to these books before they gained much fame, and I was so glad to see so many others elect to read them because they encompass so many themes absent from other young adult novels.  I'm not sure how much sense or impact the movies would have if the majority of viewers had not first read these books.  The film does a good job of mirroring the book with the exception of a few elements (ie. characters and scenes missing), and I think it is a good series to get into.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|i gave this 5 stars because this show leaves you on your seat at the end of each episode wanting more !!!<br />i would recommend this for any adult.<br />great show !
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Good stuff, still not as raw as older material, but a fun read and a nice way to wrap up the storyline.

B001N4OX82|5.0|I really enjoyed Troy, partly because I love Greek/Roman Mythology.  I was impressed at how well the movie stays in line with Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, a feat not well done in other movies.  Except for a few moments, the plot is quite realistic and this is a movie to be watched on several occasions.  Brad Pitt and Eric Bana do a wonderful job in their roles, as does Orlando but to a lesser degree.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Do not read the prologue first. Wait until you have finished the book. And do not be put off by it's start. The story is wonderful! Just keep reading it is worth the work. Enjoy.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Simple game to start but ramps up with time and level nicely. Worth the time to play and level and the events seem to be well thought out and the rewards scale nicely.
B0001WGDX0|5.0|A superb collection of Beethoven's nine immortal symphonies. Performed by the premier Vienna Philharmonic and the great Leonard Bernstein. A must for any collection and truly inspirational by any definition.
B000065K5S|4.0|The 1999 film was adapted from the novel “The Cider House Rules,” by John Irving.  Stars of the cast include:  Paul Rudd as Lt. Wally Worthington, Charlize Theron as Candy Kendall, Tobey Maguire as Homer Wells, and Michael Caine as Dr. Wilbur Larch (Academy Award Winning Roll).  While Rotten Tomatoes grants “The Cider House Rules” a 71%, critics gave some pretty polarized reviews expressing both praise and distaste for the film.  Confusing opinions aside, this is the movie responsible for that familiar line “Goodnight, you Princes of Maine, you Kings of New England,…” spoken by Michael Caine’s character.  I think the movie is extremely moving and well-done; the characters become very real.  I will say that this is not a movie for children, and it can be extremely sad at some parts.<br /><br />Perhaps, in part, due to John Irving’s direct involvement with the film-making process (he wrote the screenplay which won him an Academy Award) and work with director Lasse Hallstrom, there are remarkably few differences between the book and screen versions of the story.  That being said, like many ‘based-on-the-novel’ films, several characters’ personalities and/or motivations were revamped and characters featured in the book such as Angel and Melony did not make it into the movie.  These two characters had particularly large rolls in the novel, but Irving felt their involvement in the movie would create too many dynamics likely to detract from the lead story.<br /><br />The Story:  Dr. Wilbur Larch, the “headmaster” of an orphanage, plays a very fatherly roll to young Homer Wells, a twice-returned foster child.  Homer’s experiences with his foster families were devastating, but Dr. Larch gives Homer a sense of belonging at the orphanage.  Larch is many things, but among them he is a closet abortionist and ether addict who takes Homer under his wing to learn obstetrics and--begrudgingly to Homer--abortions.<br /><br />Wally Worthington of the Worthington family apply orchard and his girlfriend, Candy Kendall, come to Dr. Larch seeking an abortion, but leave taking Homer back to the orchard with them.  Homer begins to work as an apple harvester with a group of migrant workers led by Arthur Rose.  Because these migrant workers are seasonal, they are absent from the orchard for a time and upon their return, it is discovered that Arthur had raped his daughter Rose, and she is now pregnant.  Reluctantly, Homer agrees to help Rose by performing an abortion.  Rose eventually decides to run away, but not before stabbing Arthur; Arthur requests his death be labeled a suicide in an effort to reconcile with his daughter.<br /><br /> Homer and Candy engage in a relationship while Wally is away flying in World War II.  Unknown to Homer at the time, Dr. Larch had fabricated credentials allowing Homer to practice obstetrics and also altered Homer’s medical records to save him from being drafted into the war.  Wally returns paralyzed, but regains his relationship with Candy.  Dr. Larch dies from a possibly accidently overdose of ether, causing Homer to return to the orphanage to take on the roll of “headmaster.”  Homer finally learns the nature of the gifts Dr. Larch passed to him, and steps into Larch’s shoes.hington family apply orchard and his girlfriend, Candy Kendall, come to Dr. Larch seeking an abortion, but leave taking Homer back to the orchard with them.

B00BD99JMW|5.0|I know a lot of readers were probably upset with the outcome of this book, but it was an amazing book none the less!!!

Well done Ms. Veronica Roth!!!

0780619587|4.0|Child prodigy Australian pianist David Helfgott is driven by his father - eventually rising to win several local competitions and then a scholarship to the Royal College of Music in London. David's father forbade his going, possibly because David was already showing signs of instability, but David went anyway. There he won additional awards, but also began showing much greater signs of schizophrenia and was institutionalized in a Perth mental hospital. Later we was released and ended up playing the piano at a Perth wine bar. He then met an astrologer and they married.<br /><br />Helfgott returned to playing concerts - the DVD would have viewers believe he was widely acclaimed but other sources say the critics panned his performances. Similarly, his sister published a book asserting that their father was not a tyrannical despot as portrayed in the DVD.<br /><br />David now tours Australia annually and plays a few recitals in other countries. He still manifests symptoms of mental disorder, largely communicating with grunts, mutterings, and uncoordinated/repeated short phrases. Possible DVD recounting errors aside, David clearly faced and worked through a very difficult childhood and adult life, and has managed to overcome most of his disability.
006202406X|4.0|So, as the title of my review states: I disagree with the bad reviews.  Maybe for me, I didn't view this book as a romance so the ending didn't bother me that much.  Would I have liked the book more if the ending had been different - probably, but that didn't diminish the fact that I liked the book as it is written.  I think ideally, Tris becoming a politician and carrying on the fight would have made just as good of an ending.<br /><br />I really enjoyed how the \\"outside world\\" was characterized and written, even if it was a little overtly in your face.  I also really liked that there didn't seem to be any kind of commentary on which way of life was better or not better - there were good things and bad things about the factions, the factionless, and the outside world - nothing is perfect.<br /><br />Things I didn't like: After reading the book, this didn't bother me so much but as the day wore on, I realized that I really didn't like the POV switching.  I agree with the negative reviews in that the voices of the characters were too similar and sometimes the only way I could tell who's head we were in was looking at the pronouns or going back to the beginning of the chapter to see whose chapter we were on.  It also didn't help that POVs switched within the same situation - it wasn't that you got a retelling of the same circumstance from Tris's POV and then Four's POV, but more in the respect that you were with Tris, the Four walked into the room, and now you're with Four.  Plus, since we weren't in Tris's head so much, we didn't get a lot of characterization from her.  Granted we had two previous books, so we could extrapolate what she was thinking/feeling but almost all the tense moments in the books between her and Four were told from Four's point of view.  Having the story told from Four's point of view was also not well done - he seemed rash and weak a lot of the time.  I don't mind him crying or even feeling panic but the Four from Divergent seemed a lot more in control and adaptable than the Four from Allegiant.<br /><br />Little items that surprised me and that I am glad she put in there (slight Spoilers)<br /><br />Evelyn choosing Four over power.  I think this was very well done and I think a more cynical author would have gone a different way.  I very much liked that there was a mix of cynicism and hope.<br /><br />Peter erasing his memory, his reasoning for it as well as the offhand comment that he was still not a good person.  I liked this little tidbit of you are who you are but maybe changing your environment can wear away the sharper edges.<br /><br />The fact that world didn't change.  Tris and Four and their group fulfilled their goal but the world still is the world.  They made a huge difference where they are and for their city and the rippling effect of their actions may in fact change the world.  But, it didn't happen immediately because of one extreme action by one person.<br /><br />Johanna's character (the Amity leader).  I honestly think she is one of my favorite characters and I liked who she was and what she did throughout the book.<br /><br />Overall, I truly believe this book deserves a much higher rating than what is on Amazon.  I usually don't write reviews but I think that the rating for this book is unfair and really stems from one terrible thing that happens in the book (which could be construed by some that the author broke the unspoken pact made with readers of things that you just don't do).  I've read much worse books and I think this book is a good ending to the series.  Could it have been better - yes.  I would rate it 3.5 stars (and I would rate Divergent 5 stars and Insurgent 4.5 stars) but chose 4 stars because I would rather go up than down.
B00E9ZFIMM|3.0|Simple and quick with no ads, a small file size and no permissions. Very similar to just flipping open a small handheld notebook with lined paper - you just open and type and don't have to click a 'Save' button, it saves automatically when you close it. As a FAOTD, and as a basic keyboard note-taking app, I give it 3 stars because it suits my purposes for quick keyboard note-taking with no ads blinking at me. My Kindle didn't have a basic notepad app, but I don't take a lot of notes on it and don't use handwriting for notes, so this fits the bill for me, especially with no ads. For a quick basic keyboard note-taking app for the Kindle Fire, this is a good FAOTD to pick up.

The contrast of colorless, almost dirtiness of District 12 to the pristine, plastic rainbow of the Capital is nearly palpable, a character in itself.

B00D2ZF24O|1.0|Being a Sci-Fi fan and an even bigger Will Smith fan I thought that this movie would be stellar. Unfortunately, I've never been more wrong about anything in my life.<br /><br />Will Smith's acting was so sub-par that he would have done a better job of acting if he was to have talked in his sleep. I understand that he was supposed to be the \\"original ghost\\" who could control his fear/emotions in order to be invisible to \\"the enemy\\" but that same emotionless demeanor extended to his entire performance and completely destroyed any chance to salvage the character and make him appear to be more human. I can only describe his acting as mechanical and uninteresting.<br /><br />Jaden Smith's performance puts a lie to the old saying that the nut doesn't fall far from the tree. I don't know what Jaden did to prepare for this role but it is obvious that whatever he did didn't work. From his \\"acting\\" I can only presume that Jaden only got this role because his father insisted on his son playing opposite of him or that any other actors who auditioned for the role was even worse than Jaden. Maybe tanking in this role will be a hidden blessing for Jaden. He'll either have to work very hard to improve his acting or he will realise that he lacks real talent and will persue other interests.<br /><br />While the acting was very lackluster the FX were not too bad. If the story line had been better developed this movie, combined with the FX, would have been much better.<br /><br />Overall, I wish that this movie would have come with a money back guarantee. But, since I already purchased and watched this DVD and can't return it, I'll add this to my collection and only show it when I want to punish my grandchildren or others.<br /><br />To call this movie a \\"dud\\" would be insulting to other \\"dud\\" movies.

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Getting re-acquainted with Danny Torrence was an awesome trip from memory lane to a new adventure and story. Thanks Mr. King for continuing to tell me your stories.

B009NG1Q96|3.0|I hate how indecisive Americas character can be. It kinda gives me this feeling between vomiting or a headache. I think america should just choose a damn guy already. And if it's Aspen i think a lot of people would hate the series, and since the author is kind of likes to give her readers something they weren't expecting at all, its most likely America is gonna end up with Aspen considering it would give all her readers a big unexpected twist since everyone exceptions are too high for her to choose the prince. But than again.. she could end up just independent.
B00ET0PZDO|5.0|This is really fun and fast. The animation could be better but the underlying idea was great and I hope to see more in the of updates.
0061537969|3.0|This was a rather silly book, I am sad to say.<br />It is a very easy book told from a dog's point of view.<br />I can't imagine how it got onto the New York Times Bestseller listing.....
0399226907|5.0|I love Eric Carle's books! I purchased this one for 2 baby showers and my grandchild. A picture was taken of her placing her little finger in the holes of the foods the caterpillar ate through. Precious! She loves books and she is only 10 mon. old.
B00E0W8RE0|1.0|Very low audio. Cheap. Was really excited for this, a piece of s***. Not worth $30 for subpar audio. Stay away.
B007549W62|5.0|Good concept, good plot, good scares, good acting. Michael Biehn holds down the film, and it's a simple illustration of a contained thriller that can show how bad people get when society breaks down.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game its fun and challenging.  this game is adventitious and exciting. love the new halloween decoration. the quest give you something to work for.

0316228583|1.0|I feel strongly that if you write an outstanding series for children, you have a certain responsibility to maintain values in future books, even those intended for adults. Like a child star gone wrong, this book went the wrong way ... Language & situations just way too dark!!!  It dampened my enjoyment of the Harry Potter series.
B0041T52S6|5.0|This film is like a love letter to the 90s. It has more imagination and creativity in 10 minutes that most entire films. An amazing eye-candy treat.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|A great game to have. I like playing at work on my breaks. I've tried at lot of games for the kindle fire this one is a keeper.
B002R88G5E|5.0|Storytelling that's captivating from the first word written. It's grips your heart from the very start and makes you feel compassion and the humanity of love, tragedy and sorrow. Growing up in Australia my whole life - priding myself that I am accepting of all races and religions, it made me wake up that there is nothing honourable in letting myself believe this - when there is so much suffering out there but also in my own beloved country.<br /><br />Khaled couldn't be more on the money when he says that gender inequality and downright abuse of basic human rights couldn't be the biggest atrocity of the modern world.<br /><br />The story opens up a world that I didn't really know much about (still don't know much about) but it leads me into the enquiry of how the truth can be so multidimensional. And now next time I see a woman in a burqa, I really will ask the question, who are they?
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I can't believe this book was written by the same person.  Very disappointed.  Instead of reading these books over and over, like I normally do with a any good trilogy, I will move on quickly to scrub my brain of this one.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Right amount of challenge with nice graphics. As others have said, I do wish it was longer. Looking forward to the release of new rooms.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love this app!  It is easy to use and add books to my iPad, reducing the need for multiple devices.

B005LAIIPS|4.0|Even with the change of characters it was interesting to follow the methods used to try to catch him. Some old faces showed up anf several new to keep the adventure going at a swift pace.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I loved it! It was like early Stephen King! As a young one, I couldn't put The Stand down or The Shining.. As an old one now, I didn't want it to end.. I loved the fact that we get to know more about Danny!.. A Great read, Mister King!!!
B00EA8UEZ4|5.0|This book is superb. The book begins with an overview of the Course that is one of the best, most succinct overviews I've ever seen.  The chapter and health guidance is truly groundbreaking.  I'm using several and feel better than I've felt for a long time.  I liked it so much that I am reading it again.  Thank you Arten and Pursah and of course, Gary for being willing to serve others so faithfully.
B004SIP8JI|5.0|Hugh Jackman and Meg Ryan fill this film with great fun.  You believe the story line and hope that what happens is possible.
B00F91RYL8|3.0|World war Z is a solid, entertaining movie. The cast is great, and the writing flows well. Its a zombie movie with an epic scale. All these things combine and ultimately work to tell what i hope is only the first chapter in a story that could stand to have a couple more sequels. That said, the fact that we have another zombie movie isnt exactly exhilerating. Rather, maybe a tad exhausting. Considering just how far the zombie craze has gone. In any case what i said stands. WWZ is a solid zombie flick.
B00BB3UYS8|5.0|This is a new genre for me and I enjoyed the book enormously. The author's imagination swept me away into new worlds and ways of thinking about this mean old world we live in. If I had a choice I'd like to live like Nate.<br /><br />I don't know if these are old concepts and ideas as it is all new to me and magical.I read it with delight and complete suspension of disbelief.<br /><br />One of the pleasures of the book was its editing and proofreading. For me the blend between reflection, exposition, and action was just right. The story swooped along and carried me away.<br /><br />It doesn't get much better than that, does it?
B00EH0K9H8|1.0|Same experience as others have reported. Blu-ray disk will not play in the 3 Blu-ray players I own. Craptastic product! 8^(
B00AEFXJ86|5.0|Black Snake Moan sure has a weird hook. Setting: Deep South. An older black man who plays the blues keeps a white nymphomaniac on a chain to cure her of her horniness. About half-way through, my husband turned to me and said \\"And why exactly did you think I would like this movie?\\" I winced and said I thought it would have blues as more of a central theme. But guess what, he stayed around and pronounced it a good movie after all! His summary is the best: \\"everyone has their struggles, and you are never really free of them.\\"
B007J4T2G8|4.0|What a surprise!  this is a page turner can't wait to see what happens and who really changes. Now I gotta read the other two books
B00BD99JMW|3.0|*****Spoilers below*****<br /><br />First for the things I actually did enjoy:<br /><br />A) Tris and Tobias actually talk to each other. He tells her about the secret meeting. She leaves the message with Caleb before she dies. They definitely showed some growth at least in that aspect.<br /><br />B) the epilogue-even though I didn't agree with the ending. I'm glad Tobias faced his fears.<br /><br />ETA: C) good or bad, this book made me feel something. I didn't quite lose it when Tris died. But when Tobias found out? I cried. A Lot. I don't often cry at books, so well done by Ms. Roth for moving me to tears. Great writing in that scene in particular.<br /><br />I'm sure there's more, but that's all I can think of now.<br /><br />And now for the bad news:<br /><br />1. Let me start by saying I didn't hate the ending. I get it. Roth was going for the shock factor and she got it. I understand why she killed Tris. But to survive the death serum an then to get shot? Seemed a little ridiculous (ETA to further make this point: I read this on BookRiot and it summed up exactly why I didn't like HOW she died: Think about Lord of the Rings. What if Frodo makes it to Mt. Doom, changes his mind about giving up the ring, survives the attack from Gollum, only to get shot and killed by an arrow from an Orc? That would've been a huge letdown, and that's how this read to me.) it wasn't that Tris died, it was the HOW, at least for me.<br /> Plus I feel Caleb needed the redemption. I would have much rather seen the aftermath of her decision to let him go and how it may alter future relationships (including the one with Tobias).<br /><br />2. The entire resolution between Evelyn and Tobias was a major WTF moment. She makes decisions throughout the other books where she leaves her son, uses him for her own means, etc. and then all of the sudden he's gives this ultimatum and she takes it! Huh?!? Where in her character from the previous books was that ever shown?!? I don't get it. But I guess it was a way to resolve the issue with the Allegiant.<br /><br />3. The entire GD and GP plot. that was something that needed to be introduced in the final book? I also didn't really like that that was what being divergent was. I expected more. All being divergent was was basically being normal? Okaaaaay then. Way to build something up for 2 books only for it to basically become a non-entity.<br /><br />4. Tobias. He ended up joining a revolution without really knowing the entire reason. For someone who always looked out for himself (and Tris) he certainly followed Nita blindly. His entire character became convoluted and his personality seemed to change a lot during this last book. Don't even get me started on the \\"jealousy\\" issue that was addressed. I get that they're 16 and 18. But as much as they've gone through together, they were both really insecure in their relationship.<br /><br />5. I felt the whole world that Roth built inside the fence was completely disregarded in the final book. It was hardly even mentioned. Once they leave (which was WAY too easy, even though Tori died. Evelyn sends no one after them? Really?!) it's hardly mentioned. It was weird.<br /><br />6. The secondary characters. People that we'd come to know seemed ignored. Uriah is hardly mentioned until he's put in a coma. Tori is shot really quickly and just left. It just felt so \\"off\\" from why happened in the first 2 books.<br /><br />7. The whole Bureau/Government stuff. If they'd previously helped removed a few divergent people, when why let them try to mass-kill all of them? And if Tris' mom knew Tris was divergent and in danger-then why didn't she try to get Tris out? None of the Bureau and government issues felt fully fleshed out to me.<br /><br />8. Dual points of view. While it was interesting to read both sides, their \\"voices\\" often sounded the same and blended together. A few times I had to go back to the start to the chapter to see who was narrating.<br /><br />9. The pacing.The first half felt off. I felt not enough time was given to the trials of traitors, forming of the Allegiant, and then their escape. It went super fast. And then once they got outside the fence I felt it dragged on. So slow. Had to remind myself to keep reading on a few occasions. And then once the action started it definitely picked up and held its pace until the ends.<br /><br />3/5. It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't great. It most definitely didn't live up to the high expectations I had for it. I may reread again in the future. Maybe I'd like it more the 2nd time around.
159463176X|3.0|I blew through all 400 pages in about a week, which is pretty good for me.  I loved the writing style and the imagery.  I truly looked forward to sitting down to read more.  However, since I didn't read it all in one sitting, I admit having a little trouble following the jumping between &#34;authors.&#34;  Also, it took me until the very end to appreciate the theme.  Of course, now that I finished it, I can look back at the entire story with an appreciation.

B00AEDDSTI|5.0|Great, riveting, and easy read. Yes the movie kinda sucked. Get over it. This is a book, not a movie, and it's far far better.
0385350864|3.0|Let me preface this by saying I gave it three stars because of the fact that I enjoyed coming home from work and reading it after a long day in the office. It was a nice escape.<br /><br />However, as a Bridget Jones novel...it was not really what I'd hoped to read.<br /><br />Bridget is back and has aged in real time. She's now 51, a widow and has two children. A friend of mine had accidentally spoiled the death of Mark Darcy by telling me about an interview she'd seen with Helen Fielding prior to the book's release. So, when I started, I was curious as to a) why Fielding had killed off Mark and b) how it would be handled.<br /><br />Ok, question a) was pretty obvious- why Mark was dead. Well, Bridget needed to be single. She needed to be neurotic again. She needed to have disastrous encounters with mysterious men that could lead to romance.<br /><br />As to how Mark's death was handled...well, there were moments when I felt horrible for Bridget. She was clearly lonely and trying to figure out how to get back into the world. I would have liked to have known what happened to Mark a little sooner in the book just to have got it out of the way. We start out with Bridget five years after Mark has died and then we spend a great portion of the time flashing back to a year earlier. It took me a while to adjust to that.<br /><br />There were some parts of this flashback that were a bit too polished for the Bridget Jones we knew. Bridget's amazing weight loss while starting out amusing was just too...neat and tidy. She dropped 30+ pounds and goes from tubby to somewhat svelte in a couple of months. And then she proceeds to go back to her normal eating habits while still drinking copious amounts of alcohol and she doesn't gain more than a couple of pounds. I suppose it just seemed a little out of character for Bridget to have that type of discipline in the first place! Granted, she had help this time. I liked that she had a hiccup and started regaining weight but she ends up dropping it without barely a longing for a ham and cheese Panini. After she loses the weight, she seems to go back to her old eating habits- bags of grated cheese, ham and cheese Panini's and Big Macs...and gains only a pound or two. It just seemed a little too...unBridgetlike.<br /><br />And then there are her friends- Shazzer has now moved to the U.S. and been replaced by someone named Talitha who really isn't terribly different from Shazzer- just older. Jude, who we'd last seen happy with Vile Richard, was now unhappily split from him and blasting through bad dates from online dating sites. Tom is very much the same Tom- that is to say, somewhat shallow, annoying but incredibly loyal to Bridget without actually being a very good friend.<br /><br />In a way,this book seemed a little like Fielding's excuse to show she uses modern social practices. Bridget's Twitter obsession got rather old quite quickly. Her texting was ridiculous- I know Bridget has always been scatty and disorganized but to sit in a rather important meeting about her screenplay and blow it off by texting her nanny and boy-toy during the whole thing was just over-the-top cringe-worthiness.<br /><br />And then there's the boy-toy. He's...nice. He's bland...we are supposed to think he's charmed by Bridget and her bad-habits but it's pretty obvious from the get-go that it's a fling and it's hard to be invested in it. However, the relationship does let Bridget come back into the dating world so I suppose there's a purpose.<br /><br />There were times when the book hit a nice pace. I actually enjoyed the moments when Bridget was a mother- dealing with the kids and their lives, I found her to be at her most 'normal'. It was nice to see how she tried to compensate for being a single parent and how she handled that. Even as a non-parent, I found that a little more interesting than all the fart jokes and vomiting-in-her-mouth she did on her dates with Roxster, her boy-toy.<br /><br />*SPOILER about the ending*<br />The biggest problem I had was the 'happily-ever-after'. There is a character mentioned throughout the book- a periphery character who pops up just often enough that it becomes a little obvious that more is intended for him. Sure enough, he turns out to be a somewhat Mark Darcy-esque character with a heroic streak and a suitably wealthy, masculine background who, for some reason, falls in love with Bridget enough that he settles down with her at the end. It was just...far too convenient. And the only reason he seems to love her is because she accidentally showed him her thong and she treats him rather badly. We have another 'love you just as you are' scenario which made me miss Mark Darcy rather desperately.<br /><br />I think if Helen Fielding had maybe used another Jane Austen or other book as a guideline- as she did with \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" in the original, the book wouldn't have been so uneven. I did love revisiting with Bridget to some degree. She really hasn't changed that much. However, the problem also is...that she really hasn't changed that much and after 16 or so years, a little more maturity and wisdom would have been nice.ding*<br />The biggest problem I had was the 'happily-ever-after'.

B003G4W49C|4.0|Set at the dawn of time, one man must decide the fate of mankind before the Deities of Creation. This book puts the reader in the perspective of the first mortal who must argue for the supremacy and perpetuation of the race of man.  Over 900 pages of trenchant dialogue set in the oral style of a turn-of-the-century British Admiralty Court, this compelling novel is sure to rivet your attention and uncomfortably force you to reconsider the purpose of life.
B000FC0SIM|4.0|I had always wondered how Stephen King came up with the ideas for his stories. I love that he talks about how his upbringing, family, and just a love of reading and writing contributed to this amazing imagination and to his success. He is advice is simple, helpful, and encouraging. His goal is not give you the formula to being Stephen King, but to provide an aspiring writer some basic tips to creating an environment and practice that he felt would be conducive to producing the best results.

B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Miss Peregrine's was a very fun read. With it's peculiar children it was very much like reading an X-men comic. The world of the book came to life with wonderful descriptions, imaginative and relatable characters, and the added bonus of truly remarkable photographs. When I first heard about the photos in the book I thought that it would be gimmicky but it wasn't and the photos do enhance the overall experience of the book. I know from previous reviews that there were problems with the pictures not being clear but I think that has been addressed because I had no problems seeing and manipulating the photos and letters. I do highly recommend this book and I feel it is appropriate for all ages. With it's action and suspense it is one entertaining ride and I can't wait for the next book in this series.

B00BD99JMW|4.0|I loved Divergent.  I liked Insurgent a lot.  I liked Allegiant, just not as much.  It packed an emotional wallop on more than one occasion.  Even over a week after reading it I am still sad. That to me means many of these low reviews are wrong.  The heart of this story was still there.<br />I was expecting a bit more than we got about the world outside Chicago or maybe about the aftermath of everyone knowing the truth...or maybe just everyone knowing the truth.  I think the ending was always coming but it still broke my heart.<br />What I didn't like about this book was the voice of Four.  I kept having to go back and see who I was reading as there wasn't much difference between Tris and Four.  And I didn't like his voice.  I know he's damaged but his voice made him seem weak. And Four is anything but weak!<br />To me the most important part of this story was about being brave. You have to believe in something and take action no matter how scared you are.  Tris continued to do that until the end.  She will go down as one of my favorite book heroines and I can't wait for my daughter to be old enough to read this series.

And it's not even that the word has a missing letter or two; often the word that appears doesn't even make sense or look like what it should be.  It's very distracting and annoying.  Takes away from the story.

B00EKQ3YZI|2.0|OK, we ALL know Donna Summer. She was a rarity; a Singer & Artist that crossed ALL Ethnicities, Sexualities, and Ages. Her Music(with help from Giorgio & Crew) ALWAYS made People feel Good. Heck, Her Music made people FEEL.<br /><br />  So, when a Friend alerted me to a Remix Compilation of Donna's Hits was coming out, I was VERY hesitant. HOW can you improve on DOCUMENTED PERFECTION?! well, turns out, my instincts were right.<br /><br />  This compilation obviously wants to bring Donna's music to a Younger Generation, and I can understand that. Even she should reach TODAY'S youth, to get them to appreciate and FEEL her Rich, Supple, Strong Vocals over music that set and trancsended Disco, like my Generation did in the 70's & 80's. but, the BLASPHEMOUS misuse(or non-use) of her vocals on some of these tracks by the remixers make me wonder if Today's Youth will even get to HEAR her Voice!<br /><br />  NOW, onto the tracks: the CLEAR winners here were Chris Cox & Giorgio Moroder's mix of 'Love To Love You Baby'(giving it a tough, Electro-Club / Funk vibe), Chromeo & Olivers' fun 80's Daft-Punk-y 'Love Is In Control'(which FINALLY brings Donna out FRONT, something Quincy Jones forgot in 1982), and the Oh-So-Sexy-& Romantic Masters At Work remix of 'Last Dance', which has subduded strings, strong Basslines & light percussion, giving the song a Late Summer, Beach-y vibe, and Donna's  Vocals are OUT FRONT for us to FEEL her, for us to Fall in Love to and find someone for our OWN 'Last Dance'. Kudos, Kenny & Louie!!<br /><br />....BUT, there are SOME slight missteps here: I LOVE Frankie Knuckles since the Late 80's, but his (& Eric Kupper's) 'Hot Stuff' remix sounds as if it was done in 1992! Dated & Too 'soft' for such an agressively attitudinal song, but enjoyable(love the chord changes in the hook); The Afrojack Mix is VERY much 'Today', but loses Donna somewhat in the Pounding Grooves...the reason why this song is Legendary is not just from Giorgio's Electronic setting, but DONNA'S VOCALS, which gave the song it's ethereal feel!<br /><br />  OH, and speaking of Donna's VOCALS...the Holy Ghost! remix of the underground Disco classic 'Working The Midnight Shift', doesn't even use Donna AT ALL! some session singer sings the ENTIRE song, leaving Donna to sing a 15 second ad-lib the end of the chorus!! Now Mind you, the Remix is AWESOME and the singer sounds great, but Donna's Original weary, wonderous childlike vocals would have put this OVER THE TOP!<br /><br />...now, the tracks that put me 'Over The Top'...in ANGER: the harsh synths on Laidback Luke mix of 'MacArthur Park'; the lazy Hot Chip remix of 'Sunset People' which makes Donna sound like she wants to go to sleep; and the ATROCIOUS remixes of 'On The Radio'& 'Dim All The Lights' which the remixers acted as if they couldn't even be BOTHERED with Donna and turned her Classics into empty DUBS!<br /><br />  Verve Records usually turn out some GREAT remix compilations (notably the Verve Remixed series), so they do take chances on upcoming remixers and proven talent to make the singer(s) 'Current'. but, with a Legend like Donna, this should have been thought out more. where are her OTHER hits?! NO remixes for 'She Works Hard For The Money'? How about tracks that are RIPE for touchups, like 'Dinner With Gershwin'? why are many of the tracks edits & 'short versions'? TWO VERSIONS of 'I Feel Love'?! Questions, Questions....<br /><br />  Of Course, true Donna Fans know there's a 'New' Song here by Donna...unfortunately, 'La Dolce Vita' is not one of her strongest. it CLEARLY sounds like a leftover track from the \\"Crayons\\" CD, and only reminds longtime Donna fans how much she NEEDED Producers like Giorgio (hell, even S/A/W)to make HER stand out front with GREAT MUSIC to showcase her GREAT VOCALS.<br /><br />So, it looks like this collection is a mixed (yet, half empty) bag. I for one, wil remain patient until maybe a Box Set of her Albums(maybe with some her recent, long out-of-print remixes tacked on,like the Thunderpuss Mix of 'Love Is The Healer')come out, or maybe even a ALMIGHTY 'We Love Donna' series, like they did for Miss Ross & The Pet Shop Boys.<br /><br /> But, if she's listening from that great Big Discoteque in the Sky, we'll ALWAYS Love to Love You, Donna....
006202406X|1.0|I almost never write reviews, but this book was so unbelievably disappointing that I had to.<br />****Spoliers ahead****<br />In the words of another reviewer, if you loved the first two books please just imagine how you would think this would end.  Killing off Tris is not a heroic act in any way.  It's not like the rest of the book leads to some big moment where you just realize that it HAD to happen in order for the series to end as it should.  If the author had set it up that way, then I would have no problem with her death.  But I swear, it's seriously as if the author is screaming at you &#34;See!  She really was abnegation!&#34;  The way this book is written I can only surmise that this thought is what the author wanted you to take away...because the storyline leads you no where else.<br />Honest to the Heavens....I have NEVER been so excited about a book to then be this let down.  I would get my money back if I could.
006202406X|1.0|SPOILERS..... I don't even know where to begin, I am mad and really just heartbroken. I now can completely relate to Kathy Bates in Misery (before anyone freaks out calm down it was a joke) I have read this series from the first week it came out, I invested years in this story telling everyone I knew to read it. Now I feel like calling every single one and telling them to run in the opposite direction! The writing was good, and yes I absolutely love the first two novels, but if JK Rowling or Suzanne Collins did what Roth did they would have had a mutiny on their hands. There was no need for Tris to die, I would have even been fine with a plot twist where she dies and some strange reaction to the death serum brings her back, but there was absolutely no need for her to die. I WILL NEVER READ ANYTHING FROM VERONICE ROTH AGAIN!!!!
B00EKQ3YZI|4.0|Anyone that is familiar with what verve does would have expected a similar product.  Its a update to some of donna's classic recordings.  Im sorry that some of the reviewers are very emotional and seem to be upset.  I dont get that.  This disc is not meant to satisfy them it was meant to update her hits and help to introduce her to a much younger audience.  I love her old stuff and own most of it but frankly its dated and unlike many of her peers she never did a remix album.  Shirley Basseys remix album introduced her to a similar audience and helped her to beseen in a totally different light.  I think thats what the intention is here.  Im sure donna summer would have been pleased.  The thing that really impressed me with this cd is that the clearity of her voice is so obvious on some tracks that anyone who listens with an open mind wonders why she still is underrated as a vocalist.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad its on Kindle now! Been waiting and waiting for Candy Crush to be on here!! Its about time
B007MJ9LA2|5.0|Again! one can not go wrong with purchasing Santana music. He is such a great artist. This CD is a must.
B005LCYR7Y|5.0|Somewhere along the line Stephen King stopped writing horror and started writing life. Either way he's a genius.<br />It took me five weeks to read the first four hundred pages, then two days to read the last three hundred. This is not a quick read, nor always easy. It's just damn good, and if you're a writer it will make you want to write better.<br /><br />Greg Barron, author of [[ASIN:B007HFOEOO Rotten Gods]] and [[ASIN:B00BOEI4KY Savage Tide]]
B0084B5TK8|5.0|Nothing like the real thing.  There are only a couple of movies that would even come close to comparing to the book.
B000PTYPAC|5.0|Everyone likes to classify music in some manner.  We like everything to fit into nice, neat boxes because it gives order to our lives in a sense.  This album....is it rock?  Pop?  Punk?  I don't know what to label it, but it doesn't matter because it's one of the best albums I've ever heard.  Period.  The tunes are catchy, the singer's voice is fantastic.  I very rarely, if ever, give anything five stars.  This is quite deserving of it, though.  Every song hits me in some way.
B008KYOCA2|4.0|Well organized calendar, useful cool features that help remind you of upcoming appointments.  You can also set events up for an alarm
B003VANOFY|5.0|Very nice headset. completely worth it. I just love the 3 &#34;G buttons&#34; on the side of the headset, how you can set them to do exactly what you want them to do, you can even set them to do specific button presses or a combination of button presses on your keyboard. The mic is great as well, love how you can just rotate it up to mute it instead of having to press a button, but it has a mute button on the headset as well if you would rather do that! The charging cable is great, it has a USB dock on it to put the wireless adapter in.<br />The only downside that i could think of is that you have to go to a website to download a program to be able to set it up, but its a very small downside and still very much worth it.
B00BP29SAA|1.0|downloaded it to my Kindle Fire for my 6 year old grandson he played it about 1 hour and got tired of the game. It was a little confusing and you had to keep starting over again. Eventually I deleted it because he didn't really like the game. This is just my opinion your child might like it.
B000002NJM|5.0|As a big Tarantino fan, I tend to appreciate his choice in music in many of his movies....especially in relation to his characters. He reminds me of how John Hughes used to pick music for his movies. This soundtrack is a great 'chill in' on a Sunday type of music. I listen to it on my way to work in the morning as the trax on it help me to relax. I also enjoy Samuel Jackson antedotes now & then that are on the soundtrack a'la Pulp Fiction soundtrack which is another one of my favorites.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|After being a loyal fan to this series for so long, I am left heartbroken and angry. I can't believe I wasted a year of anticipation for this book. I have no problems with the beginning and middle of the book but the ending was HORRIBLE! I don't want to give out spoilers but lets just say a beloved character dies when it could have been avoided!! I'm really tired of authors not knowing how to write a good conclusion. I'm still a little upset about Hunger Games. This is not the ending I wanted or expected for this series. Roth should really consider rewriting it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Yep!  That about sums up this game.  I was hesitant to get this game until I started finding out how many adults play it.  Now I know why they do.  It's fun and addicting.  Enjoy!
1619698463|5.0|Informative, compelling...probably one of the most important books of our generation. Take heed and make better choices, you health is in your own hands.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love my Kindle but have been very disappointed that I couldn't get Candy Crush. Thank you so much, I am thrilled to have it now!
B008EEZ64Y|4.0|It was a great book, but I only gave it 4 stars because the beginning was kind of slow and sluggish.
006202406X|1.0|Maybe having happy endings in novels is a cliche but WHO CARES. Clearly, seeing all these 1 star reviews, that's what everyone wants! And that's what Tris and Tobias deserved. The ending is sickeningly sad it is so disappointing. I can't decided if it makes you cry because you're sad for Tobias or because you're so upset that the series ended this way! Half of me feels like I would've felt better just reading the first 2 and never reading this disappointing ending.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I love Neil Gaiman.  I wish my mind was capable of working in the same creative way........Grumble.  All his books are great.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Love this clock..no tick tick sound.....great illumination....so nice to<br />awake to music you selected for your self.  I put this on my guy's Kindle also.
B000FC13Y0|5.0|I think I've read everything he's written and I've never been disappointed.  He has a brilliant mind. Thank you Neil.
B00ECJ18HO|4.0|The Hound of the Baskervilles certainly delivers. Everything a mystery fan could ask for is found within these pages; action, dread, romance (no matter how sneaky it may be), and, of course, pure mystery. Sherlock Holmes is THE detective, and as such, does a remarkable job on the case, the most intriguing  of cases he's ever had. A fun read indeed.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I thought it would be better.<br />but you get to a point and you need money.<br />oh well it was free and I will remove it<br />  tom
006202406X|3.0|I'll be honest, this is an incredibly difficult review for me to write. DIVERGENT is one of my favorite reads (EVER) and while I know a lot of people didn't like it, Tris' journey from Abnegation to Dauntless resonated with me on a deeply personal level.<br /><br />I've been waiting a year and a half for the conclusion of Tris and Four's story (just like everyone else) and I was expecting a gut-wrenching thrill ride, but not like this. This book has left me heartbroken and disappointed for so many reasons.<br /><br />Yes, the choices the characters make are consistent with who they are (mostly) and I \\"get\\" how the story comes full circle with Roth's faith woven into the fabric of it all. But the WAY it ends felt like it was done purely for shock value and just seems pointless.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised how easily myself and my 6 year old son could follow the instructions to put the village together. We love taking them apart and rearranging them how we like. Awesome product!!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Best game around!!!!  So glad finally able to play this on my Kindle.  Can't get enough of it.  Thank you Amazon!
B003G4W49C|5.0|Suggested reading for scientifically literate people.  Fast, easy read.  A book you don't want to stop reading nor want to finish.
B00008PX8P|4.0|Video and sound was fantastic. I was very disappointed that it DID NOT include closed captioning as advertised, but it was great anyway.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|While I love the way Stephen King writes and I will continue to read him I really thought a follow up to The Shining would be scary. It was not. The book was still a good read.
006202406X|1.0|I personally will never invest my time in a Veronica Roth series again! After waiting for this book for so so long I was left not only disappointed but wishing that I had just never read it and used my imagination to fill in the rest of the story. I understand what the author was trying to go for but the world is a miserable enough place I don't set out to read books that leave me miserable and depressed.
B008MM9630|5.0|This game is very addicting and wildly entertaining! I find myself playing it everywhere and all of the time. I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys games Like sims, bakery story or any other realm creation games. It has something for everyone!
0670026603|5.0|This book is well-written and deals with important issues.  It made me laugh and cry!  I recommended it to my book club and everyone loved it.
B0044XV3QY|3.0|This is a very good movie. The only downside is that in this day and age many movies come with digital copy...NOT THIS ONE! BOOOOOOOO!
006112429X|1.0|This book came highly recommended, and I desperately wanted to read something frightening for the Halloween season. I adore unusual words and am quite comfortable with incorporating them into my everyday language, but Ms. Shriver seems a little desperate.  It honestly felt like she went through her word-of-the-day calendar to see how she could possibly work one in on each page. The message was lost in the method, and it never once felt like I was reading a letter from a wife to a husband. There was no intimacy in tone or tale, just the sense that each chapter was written by an overly enthusiastic English undergrad.  I've given up on approximately 4 books in my entire history of reading- I'll grimly slog through anything, just so I can chalk it up to finishing it so I can move on.  This one of the rare books that simply had nothing that made it worthwhile to keep going.
B00FF8OKJE|1.0|Unable to complete a simple update unable to play or open game. Paid $ for rubies now unable to play! mot recommended
B004HXIZVC|5.0|i just love it... whn this was created, it must hv been created just 4 me<br />;<br />0 it's all tht n some i cant say enough about it, but  thanks to the creators!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I loved this story.  It shows several perspectives of different lives and their triumphes and tribulations.  An amazing story to read
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|so glad amazon finally got candy crush. i an so addicted. now all my favotite games are on the kindle fire.
B0027MJU00|5.0|twisted, evasive plot, cant put down, read for book club, great conversation followed ...that is all using up words, done
0143038419|4.0|I think anyone can benefit from reading this. Those who say it is self indulgent are missing the point. I really liked it.
B004HWYTP4|3.0|I enjoyed the movie as a fairy tale (figured this out shortly) as I assume the director didn't want to get all detail oriented and probably wanted to focus on the story a bit more. Okay job on not having so many guns with unlimited ammunition, showing belt fed guns or more frequent mag changes, but still unrealistic deployment of some of the weapons (RPG, grenade launcher).  In addition, I was uncomfortable with the \\"good guys\\" shooting at CIA, FBI, Secret Service, and Police Officers; why would we commend killing likely innocent service men of our country.
B00947N6UG|5.0|We haven't even opened this yet, since I bought it as a gift for my kids, but my guess is that the DVD/Blu-ray/Digital Copy all work the same way every other one does. The movie itself I would definitely recommend. I recorded it when we had free movie channels with DirecTV and it quickly became a family favorite in our house. My daughter even pretends to be playing with Jack Frost and Sandy, but she says her favorite is the Tooth Fairy. It just brings all the magic of these Guardians to life in a way that I never imagined. It really is a wonderful movie.
B004CQ5GMU|5.0|Works great, I am storing my movies on the disc, it is very easy to use and is at a great price! Highly recommended.
1594744769|4.0|Fantasy, for sure, and I enjoyed it. I think Harry Potter fans would love this and it's particularly well suited to teens (I'm not).
B003B02PFO|5.0|Before I bought this book, I watched Christmas with the Kranks on television. I have to say, this book is very similar to the movie. Since then, this book has become a timeless favorite of mine. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone.
B009AMANBA|3.0|This movie wasn't what I thought it would be. It was just okay, I suppose but I feel it was a bit boring.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This game is assume I would recommend it to anyone. If your a hunter you need<br />to try it and have fun. I can give it to my kids to play while I'm hunting
B00F91RYL8|4.0|One of Brad Pitt's best movies. If you like zombie movies then you'll really like this one!! Hope you everyone enjoys it
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fun cheap game for everyone to love and play if you don't play this you should just jump off a cliff!I love the cute minions the most enjoy this spectacular game NOW!!!!!!!!!!
B000I9YLUI|2.0|After reading the book and watching the unparallel performance of Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle, I was hoping for another great interpretation, especially with such great cast.<br />But to my disappointment it was embarrassing, cheesy and unreliable.<br /><br />Oh well. Will stick with the BBC production then.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Loved it needs more levels.. Not that hard. I like puzzles so it was pretty interesting for me. Twenty levels would be nice.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love that it's available for download for kindle fire hd!<br />I love it! Great graphics and easy to see! A must have for chasing away boredom!
B009AP2G26|5.0|I would reccomend this to everyone! love it so much i cant even explain it!!!! it is amazing! love it to death!
B008Y7X0J4|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  The characters are well-suited for this particular story line.  I intend to watch this again.  I love a happy ending.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|If you like puzzles THIS IS THE THING! This game brings you awesome 3D zoom in-and-out awesomeness i give it a five star because this awesome game.....for $.99 i mean seriously,who would reject a cool game like this&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;if you never played this game you`ve never played, cause this,is,THE BOMB!!!!!!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Love it, so far. I like building families and making money to buy new things. I hope they create new levels to play. This seems to be an awesome game so far
006202406X|5.0|When I started reading Allegiant yesterday, I read a lot of negative reviews on Amazon. I was a little disappointed that people were giving spoilers out in the open about it. I have no intention of giving any spoilers, but I do want to give the novel justice.<br /><br />The ending was atypical, yes, for a YA dystopian series. But does that necessarily make it a bad thing? The entire series is about selflessness, courage, bravery, sacrifice, etc.. The list could go on. Tris stays true to her character, which is something that I was glad to see (many other YA dystopian trilogies strayed away from this). There was this sense of completeness at the end. I felt it was the only possible ending. I would have been disappointed had anything else happened. Veronica Roth did an interview with NPR and she said, \\"I was sure of it from the very beginning, what would do justice to these characters and this story, and I feel very strongly that this is the best possible ending for this book. And I'm extremely happy with it -- even though I know it will be alarming, maybe.\\" I agree that she did this. There was harmony in the ending.<br /><br />I truly enjoyed this book and feel like the people who gave it such negative reviews don't understand that literature doesn't always have the ending you want. People always want some cookie cutter \\"happy\\" resolution to the story. Some say the story doesn't end with hope, but it does.<br /><br />Enjoy this book for the story, not some ridiculous expectation of what you think it should be. Nicely done, Veronica Roth.
B0039Q7QKE|5.0|Solid construction, and perfect size for a costume! I'm very happy with it. The two pins are on the right side of the badge (the thicker side) and support the badge unnoticeably well. It has good weight, but doesn't droop your shirt. I would definitely recommend this product for any costume/cosplay. On a quite nerdy note: There is nothing like putting this on your shirt for the first time! It feels so real, you can't help but tap it and say, &#34;(Your name) to the bridge.&#34;
B00DWFQ2N4|3.0|The second part of this two CD release just does not measure up to the first one, it doesn't have the same old school R&B feel and the songs are just not that good, they also run too long. Timberlake probably should had stopped after the first one, this one just feels like a bunch of reject songs that did not make the cut for the first CD put out as CD number two.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Who . Is not playing this game. The levels get harder the more u go along. If you have the patients you can play u can get heralds the levels
B0053TMP24|5.0|This book was simply amazing because it didn't just have the Greeks but it has the Romans too. I can't believe he did so well writing this book
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I've read a bunch of post apocalypse stories... This one was pretty awesome. Every time you thought you knew where it was heading there would be a twist. Really well done!
B00FAEPX9Y|5.0|This 16 year old is a very gifted singer.  Her voice is hauntingly beautiful with musical arrangements that emphasis this.  She can be soft and vulnerable but also strong and unapologetic.  She sings about things that I think everyone can relate to, not just the young but the young at heart too.  She's not glorifying a life most of us cannot achieve (with jewels and unfathomable wealth), she embraces the life she and most of us have (though I doubt she will be in the same boat as us much longer with more albums like this).  Good beats, good subject matter, and her stellar voice make this album soar.
B00C1TOTK0|1.0|Defective disc: several long scenes are completely blacked out. I suspect this is not limited to my disc. Very disappointing. Is there a<br />competently-produced disc of Shane?
B00DQBWLSO|2.0|I was very disapointed with this CD. Lots of obscure songs an Genre's thrown together. Maybe I will grow to like it but I doubt. it.
B00F9040HU|5.0|I enjoy playing this game. It is a little more challenging than past games like this which makes it more fun.
B00DJYKFXG|3.0|I was very disapointed with this box set and I returned it. If you buy the Last Waltz 2 disc edition, you will have all of the live band you need. Dylans songs were disapointing as well. The DVD only has 2 live songs. It is NOT a full concert.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|It's a Grisham.....wouldn't expect anything but a good read!  Just when you think you have it figured out, there is another surprise.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Lots of fun have to think about your moves . I think the game works well had no trouble with the game loading .
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I'm on level 417 &amp; sometimes I will still have a valid move, I can use a special candy, color bomb or the pink wheel, and it will shuffle the board on me. Very frustrating and makes it more difficult to try and beat the level.
B0046B1KHG|5.0|This is one of my kids' favorite movies so getting it on my Kindle was a no-brainer. I love it, too.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|The game is addicting. It does have some glitches in that the game freezes up, or that it won't allow you to use the power ups you have.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|I am a big fan of the Band of Brothers set. Although this series of shows was very different, it was equally good in its own right.
0385743564|5.0|Loved this book! I usually don't like \\"postapoc\\" worlds because they tend to fall apart when you pay attention to things too closely, but half way through the prologue I was all in for this story and this world.<br /><br />The pacing really worked, with the lulls between action scenes really driving the story. The action scenes (especially the green motorcycles) were fantastic.<br /><br />There were some neat twists (some I did not expect) and turns in the story and it certainly left me wanting more. Can't wait for the next book (2014).
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. Great story and very entertaining. Ms Moriarty is a terrific story teller! Need to read more of her stuff
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is the best game ever I love it I like how u can play with ur friends it had so many fun and awesome things do and my kids absolutely love this game
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game I even told my friend about it and now she is hooked on it. I don't spend. money for extra plays I just wait it out
B00BD99JMW|3.0|The ending to this book literally made me cry so much. I was bawling on my bed for an hour with a box of tissues sitting next to me. This book wasn't horrible, but if your looking for a happy ending-type story, this is not the book for you.
B001TM14VC|4.0|Not a big fan of Tom Cruse.  Some of the drama between main characters is over done.  It is entertaining.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|It makes me happy that I don't need a kindle in order to view kindle books/magazines. This is a great app
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Glad I can finally get it on my kindle. Yes!!!! Now I can play the game with more battery life instead of using my iPhone.
B00E8AVNAE|4.0|The film opens with a grindhouse rescue of a member of the Blackwater Gang about to be hung. The gang members are introduced by a decent western/bayou soundtrack (Hybrid)using wanted posters. The gang opts to rob a Colorado mining town of its disputed gold, except Red (Anthony Michael Hall) has plans of taking over the town instead of fleeing to the dismay of his half brother Guerrero (Danny Trejo) who soon becomes Swiss Cheese.<br /><br />Like so many Trejo films, he dies early on, except in this one he is still in the film as he works out a deal with the devil (Mickey Rourke) to return and kill the six gang members in 24 hours. This is something he could have done in the first 10 minutes, but that wouldn't make for the last second drama. Calathea (Dina Meyer) whose husband was killed by the gang plays a wildcard in this as the deal includes Trejo killing the men by his own hand.<br /><br />Great film for Trejo fans as he returns to his grindhouse roots.<br /><br />Parental Guide (unrated version): F-bomb, saloon girl nudity, no sex.
B005LAIIN0|5.0|Watched this one over and over.  Brad Pitt is also amazing in this one.  Highly recommend this one - great story line.
B007VUA7VO|3.0|why have this if pro is available.  The only real difference is the gimmic, pay for it and no adds.
B00E9ZFIMM|5.0|simple and  fastsimple and very fast. I was looking for something small to do just this. For me is great.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I have known the five languages of love as discussed in a radio program I was listening to a few years ago and this is the first time that I have read the whole thing myself. I liked it and would recommend it to everyone especially to couples, not necessarily those whose relationship is on the rocks. Dr. Chapman has explained each language very well that you can definitely easily understand it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|You have no idea how happy I was to see that I could finally play Candy Crush on my Kindle!!! The only thing is that it's not picking up the same # of lives that I have on my phone which is the same account. I have like 73 lives but it only shows about 2-3 at a time ....weird but who cares it works good and I'm satisfied!
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Spoiler Alert !!!  It is official \\"the trilogy\\" in books and movies is overdone and stale. If the first one is amazing, the second one is usually good and the third one falls short or in this case poor. I have read and seen a lot of trilogies, and most have the same problems to some extent. Unless you are one of the great writers or storytellers, and at this point Roth is not. On top of that in order to make yours stand out, you have to do something shock worthy like killing the main narrator in the trilogy.<br /><br />I wonder if this book was rushed, had the same editor, or if the pressure to end this trilogy was too much for Ms. Roth, as the writing doesn't even seem like the same author. The switching from Tobias to Tris was poorly done in a series that I thought initially was better written than most. Would Tobias' point of view really sound that much like Tris'? Did she save all of her character development of Tobias for her mini books? This tactic just seemed to be thrown in, because she wanted to kill Tris. She should have thought of a more creative way or at least developed the voices better.<br /><br />Also, I understand the self-sacrifice theme and how some would think Tris had to die to end the series. Still this seems contrived, and I don't think that was the most interesting theme of the book. I felt the most interesting point was we are more than just one type that the world pins us in, whether by personality, genetics or our actions. In that way having her die when she always was self sacrificing, even if she didn't realize it, didn't show character development. Which would be unusual for a 16 year old. God help us if we all have so little development when we are 16 years old, especially with that many dramatic events thrown at someone.<br /><br />Finally, the big lesson for most authors and especially YA authors, do not kill the main character who narrates the trilogy if you want your young adult audience to not revolt, and certainly not make it this soap operatic if you dare try.  Why didn't she just have another obstacle where Tris could almost die in the same scene instead of just two- it is a trilogy after all. Then we could have had some symmetry at least. Just can't wait for the movie scene where her Mother comes to her in death too.  That should be a really cheesy scene to say the least.  The readers invested in these characters,  and they don't need a happy ending, but this death was just too melodramatic and didn't add to the finale in any way.
B000B7BRMM|5.0|Wow!  What can I really say to inspire would be purchasers of this Christmas album performed by the legendary jazz vocalists Diana Krall. She sings the popular traditional holiday music in her special style that only Diana Krall has.<br />They say that \\"seeing is believing,\\" and to that I add \\"hearing this music will really make you a believer in Diana Krall.\\"<br />If you buy this holiday cd music, you will enjoy it for the upcoming Christmas/New Year's holidays now and every year into the future. Diana's rendition of \\" WHAT ARE YOU DOING NEW YEAR'S EVE,\\" was the primary reason I decided to buy this cd. Long Live Diana Krall and her great voice.
B0088W6IMQ|3.0|This show is o.k.  As the season progresses it gets better. Worth a watch. My favorite of the stargate shows.
B008Y212PI|3.0|The idea of this game is interesting. Solving a puzzle using logic to complete a photo. The puzzles are not especially difficult but fun to solve.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Does not matter what media I play candy crush, android phone, kindle, Facebook, you only get five lives. We should get additional lives as you achieve a level.
B00B2166BS|4.0|As everyone has said, it improves charging time.  It's gone from taking 6-7 hours to charge my Nexus 10, to about 4-4.5 hours.  Still a pretty long time to charge a device, but it makes all the difference.<br /><br />I use an iPhone 5 and a MacBook Air on a daily basis that actually take around 2 or 2.5 hours to charge, so getting over the charge time of the Nexus 10 is a hard feat.  However, this is not the fault of the product, and not the reason I've deducted a star.<br /><br />This is of my personal opinion, but I've read a few people on here getting their devices fully charged close to the 3-hour mark.  They also mention this is because they have a special wall wart (2.0A and above I believe).  For a rather steep price of $25, I feel an adequate wall wart should have been provided with this product.  Considering the cable is short, and can only be used for charging (no data transfer for PC or audio connection), I feel $25 may be a bit high of an asking price.  This actually makes MFi Lightning cables seem cheap.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This app is great.  My grand daughter enjoys the challenge also which makes it great for most ages.  I would recommend this (and have) to many!
B00EEDJHXA|4.0|This is a challenging game to remove all the buttons from the board. It makes you think and plan. It is also fun to see the buttons and scissors as I am a sewer.
1439102813|5.0|Picked this book up and could not put it down.  Now I understand.  EXCELLENT BOOK WAKES YOU UP.  Thank you so much.
B0089LOG02|4.0|There are two stories in the Orphan Train, and I enjoyed both. Molly, a lost-at-sea teenager living in foster care, is befriended by Vivian Daly, a ninety-something widow who eventually reveals that she was one of 200,000 children who rode orphan trains from East Coast cities to points west in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Both experienced dislocation and a lack of identity at a young age. By sharing their stories, each helps the other to deal with their personal histories. The ending is predictable, but I would have been disappointed if it had turned out differently.
B00DHHWY9I|5.0|I never did read the book so my expectations were quite different.  This was really well done and Leonardo DiCaprio is at his best although I didn't see him as the main character.  We'll watch it again.
B00DW5IKJI|4.0|I chose this rating because I really enjoy Britney.<br />I like that it has all my favorite songs to date.<br />I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys Britney Spears.
B00AW57L96|1.0|The first couple of chapters started well, but from then the book became so boring. I had read the product description and thought it sounded like a gripping book. 'To be opened in the event of my death'  nearly had a double meaning as I had to wait until 40 percent of the book had been read before the letter was opened. Far too long! I had lost interest by then so had to speed read the rest as I had paid for it after all. I cant understand why Tess and her family were in the novel at all, they dont lend anything to the plot and seem to be an add-in for extra characters. The ending was strange, informing us what the characters lives would be like if the tragedy hadnt occurred (which we find out didnt actually occur in the manner described). I suspect if this story had been written as a serial in a womens magazine the turnover for the publishers would have been enormous, given the clientelle who buy them. Perhaps thats where novels of this calibre should be printed.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|very entertaining game , make abilities to think fast , keep your brains moving and kids love it very much
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I liked this game. Definitely recommend this game if you like solving puzzles. Some rooms are easier than others. It's not very challenging, but it's fun in a mindless kind of way. I wish there where more room though.
B00BEIYMIS|5.0|I saw this in the theater when this came out.  At first, I thought that it was just going to be another uninteresting, run-of-the-mill, standard haunted house movie.  How wrong I was.  This movie was very original and genuinely frightened me which is pretty tough for a movie to do.  Anyone looking for a great scare will love this movie.
B001AIRUPE|5.0|Arrived fairly quickly, the item itself looks amazing. Perfect for any collector or fan of the movie! highly recommended for everyone.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|Full disclosure: I am a huge Sanderson fan, so I may be a little biased.  (One day I will meet him and be so embarrassed...) Anyway, another brilliant story by a master.<br /><br />This is the first Sanderson story I have read written in the first person; at first I did not like it, but it grew on me through the story.  He uses the first person well, takes advantage of it at time to be funny, definitely to try and make the action a little more intense.<br /><br />The basic premise is that &#34;Epics&#34;--which really are his word for superheros--have appeared among us, but unlike Marvel, these guys are all Bad--something about the adage &#34;absolute power corrupts absolutely&#34; I suppose.  It makes for a dark landscape, a modern world ruled by capricious nearly godlike characters, bent on subjugating and terrorizing humanity.  Still, despite it being set in a dystopic near-future, the opening scene feels like 1930s Gotham city (steel-girder city, men in fedoras packing heat...)<br /><br />Sanderson is very creative as usual, with a consistent set of &#34;rules&#34;, though definitely less defined than you find in Elantris, Mistborn, or Way of Kings.  The story focuses on a band of &#34;criminal&#34; friends, much like Mistborn--a sort of &#34;Ocean's 11&#34; in this alternate world fighting the bad superheros.  The characters are great, and fun interactions between them all, so you end up feeling like a group of friends.<br /><br />Great plot twists...while if you know Sanderson, you suspect they are coming, but still end up surprising when you get there.  Lot's more mystery still left, and he leaves it ready for a sequel. (Though I hope this project does not slow down Stormlight--because that is even better and I can't wait for that story to be told!)<br /><br />As is common in his stories, also gives you something to think about, themes of power and goodness, right and wrong.<br /><br />Thank you Professor Sanderson, and we look forward to more!
B00ECTZKJ6|5.0|This is the korn i missed. I enjoyed the past 4 albums without head, but he was the missing ingredient and now i can tell more than ever. This to me is the best record since untouchables. This is an album that must be listened to from beginning to end. The more i hear it the more i love it! Best rock record of 2013. Love all tracks, my favorite song at the moment is ''pray for me''.
157421327X|4.0|The book is fine, but it's a lot less than I needed.  I think it would be better in the hands of artistic kids.
0307277453|5.0|Wonder how those creatures figured that stuff out?  Those cells really had it going on.  Oh, but those dumb fish that never evolved, the underachievers, you might say.......did they decide to just stay put?  As usual, the evolutionists assume similarity begets relationship.  Perhaps instead of a common ancestor, could there have been a common Creator who repeated His designs among his varied creations?  You think??  No, too many uncomfortable implications to that.  Instead, let's just bury our head in the muck of evolutionary theory and call it a day!
B000002I8D|3.0|&#34;Face Value&#34; is definitely a good album from Phil Collins.<br /><br />Although Collins' albums are more or less 'pop music' albums, his first two solo albums, including this debut, still had links to progressive rock, and the most satisfying thing about this album is it's variety.<br /><br />Obviously Collins was a big R&B fan and this is reflected in his music. &#34;I Missed again&#34; is sublmie R&B, &#34;updated Motown&#34;? maybe. &#34;If leaving me is easy&#34; is an absolutely gorgeous soul ballad with a brilliant vocal.<br /><br />Tracks like &#34;Droned&#34; &#34;The Roof is Leaking&#34; and &#34;Hand in Hand&#34; show Phil exploring musical ideas, &#34;In the air tonight&#34; is a tension-building dramatic song with the signature drum sound, and &#34;This must be love&#34; is a fine acoustic ballad.<br /><br />&#34;Behind the lines&#34; - I already have it on Duke, don't I? &#34;Tomorrow Never Knows&#34; - Good version, but you'll never top the original, the other songs? okay.<br /><br />Overall, a good effort with about half the album being quite stunning. I'd rate it 7 out of 10 or three and a half.
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|Cannot wait for next season April 2014. Suspenseful, weird, yet really good. Main actors (Sara and her brother) are both scene stealers.
1476733953|2.0|The pace is plodding, the characters uninteresting, and the plot so tedious that I did not care what happened (which was good, because pretty much nothing happened).<br /><br />Eric van Lustbader wrote a post-apocalyptic underground city novel back in the 1970s (The Sunset Warrior) that is a hundred times better than this.<br /><br />I cannot for the life of me understand why this has over 5,000 five-star reviews. I couldn't recommend this one to anybody.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Horrible- got returned... I would not recommend. Boring compared to the first two. Disappointing ending that was dumb. One star
B004SBULWE|5.0|Fantastic program. Very similar to task manager for windows. Only issue I have is that some of the programs I close with it restart on there own. For those I have been force closing and it is much easier to use this than going through settings.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Fun. Great game. Not as easy as it looks. Need a little critical thinking. Very entertaining. Love asking friends for lives.
B00915G6SU|5.0|I enjoy this show other crime shows get sloppy and repeat the same storys in different ways but this show doent.
006202406X|5.0|I'm not really going to get into too much detail so the spoilers are really only implied by my opinions.<br /><br />Most people probably gave this only 1 or 2 stars because they are crying to themselves about the ending.<br /><br />I cried over the ending too.  However, I'm giving it 5 stars for the fact that not all books SHOULD have a happy ending.  Not all romances end up with perfect happy endings where everything gets tied up with a lovely pretty bow and everyone lives happily ever after.  People die.  Hearts break.  People have to learn how to move on, mend, and keep living despite the pain and the struggle of the past.<br /><br />I believe Roth made a bold move by not having the pretty little happy ending and for that I commend her because it's easy for an author to want to just do what they know the masses will want - a &#34;perfect&#34; ending.<br /><br />The dual POV's were a great tool in telling the two different struggles both Tris and Tobias were going through.<br /><br />Overall, the series was great and I think Allegiant is a great and REALISTIC ending to a story about bravery, sacrfice, love, and loyalty.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This is a light weight sharpener and great saw blade file.e it as an awl to pout holes inflaces that need holes...no Sh^&T Sherlock. Anyway, it is an adequate sharpener for camping.

B007XELMO4|3.0|Some rudimentary instructions would be nice for something that costs this much.  Will figure it out but not a great start.
140006922X|2.0|I wanted to learn more about the historical context of Jesus when I got the book, and I did learn some.  I also learned that this author over and over chooses examples and scriptures (or the lack of them) to support his belief that Jesus was a charismatic leader, but not the son of God.  This bias is as apparent to me as atheists must find bias in books by Christian pastors.  As someone who has believed in the divinity of Jesus for the past 70 years and has learned to know him as a friend and comforter in as very real way, I could not recommend this book to anyone.  It will hurt believers, who love this person as God-man and Savior, and it will discourage agnostics from seeking faith.  Atheists will read it as history, but judging from earlier reviews I read here, they are not especially recommending it as history.  If you want to understand the Muslim view of Jesus, however, this book does that.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Disappointed that it doesn't broadcast content from my iPhone, or from anywhere/anything else other than Netflix and Youtube. Perhaps they will upgrade it to do more as time rolls on... but for $35 bucks, it was well worth the experiment.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|The &#34;selections&#34; remain painfully limited and the feature that allows the laptop to connect to Chromecast really needs refinement.  It is ok for what it presently does but I am not just &#34;blown away&#34; with the coolness of the device.
B00BYISQTO|5.0|Fear corrodes any meaningful relationship--even with a favorite band. One reads volumes into tiny changes, extrapolating frightening trajectories from three points of data, then coming up with a different (but equally terrifying) scenario when a fourth point doesn't fit the others.<br /><br />Take the track length for The National's past few albums. Alligator's 13 songs made for an incredibly compelling listen, and Boxer's 12 were perfect. Then High Violet came in at 11, and my mathematical mind convinced me these awesome musicians were running out of music, on the verge of downgrading to EPs and compilation singles before running out of steam entirely. Then when Trouble Will Find Me was announced at 13 tracks, I worried they'd abandoned concision for sprawl. (This isn't the first time I've read so much into so little--take album art and titles. High Violet didn't have a predominantly black cover like its predecessors, and didn't follow the logical Alligator-Boxer-C????? progression I'd expected, so I'd worried that'd be their first departure from a trajectory of ascending awesomeness.) These things aren't entirely insignificant. The energetic colorful squiggles of the sculpture on High Violet's cover announced a charged and chaotic album whose ideas burst forth in several interesting directions, while Trouble's black-and-white mirror image of the top of a woman's head heralded a more monochromatic and precise work.<br /><br />Fortunately, that doesn't mean boring. In fact, like its immediate predecessors, this album's the opposite--there's a denseness and a richness and an intricacy that rewards multiple listens, and even requires them, because you can't take it all in immediately.<br /><br />Their music reminds me of the ocean. There's a common feel to all of it, but also an incredible variety, and an intense level of detail to the patterns. More importantly, once you've experienced it, you might think you don't need it any more, but something pulls you back. (Like a lot of my favorite music, I'm often perplexed and/or underwhelmed on first listen. Then I give it another go, just to see if I've missed something. And before long, the songs I thought I didn't like are stuck in my head, and I'm hunting down my fellow Nationalists to jabber excitedly about this lyric or that string segment or the other horn arrangement, the one that sounds like nothing you've ever heard before.) You go to the beach as a kid and it seems OK, but you feel like you can take it or leave it. And the next thing you know, you're an adult buying oceanfront property.<br /><br />Still, this is an album with the rough edges removed, the polished work of pros who have gotten incredibly good at what they do, but who might have also explored all the corners of their sound and are now, for lack of anything better to do, going back and polishing the middle. Or (to keep things nautical) it's, in the words of musicOMH's Andrew Burgess, \\"A collection of waves that never break.\\" This is a band that's steering away from the rocks and the shoals, and one sometimes misses the crashing intensity of, say, Alligator's \\"Abel\\" or \\"Mr. November,\\" or High Violet's \\"Terrible Love.\\"<br /><br />I'm glad they're also avoiding the safety of harbor. For all the energy in its music, High Violet's lyrics offered scenes of uneasy domesticity: fearful parenting, and difficult but permanent relationships. Whereas here, the music's calmer, but the lyrics are more intense, full of angst and self-loathing and confessional recrimination. \\"Everything I love is out to sea,\\" he offers on \\"Don't Swallow the Cap,\\" and it seems apropos for the album as a whole; one gets the sense he loves the drama and the chaos, and is afraid of the domesticated life sketched out on High Violet. Instead, he's riding out his own personal rough weather on the high seas, on the gray day after a big storm. It's not exhilarating, but it's compelling--and those of us who signed up for this trip a while ago want to see how long the voyage can last.e how long the voyage can last.
B00007LTIL|2.0|I'm not a dead head, but I always believed this to be a great group of songs.  Leave well enough alone.  Why do the producers of this disc add tracks which only detract from the original.  Luckily, we can erase those needless \\"live' tracks that sound really bad.  Even if you are one of those throwback souls trying to remember the live vibe of a Grateful Dead concert, you will not be pleased with the additions.
006202406X|4.0|I know some people may not like events that happen in this book, and as devastated as I may be about certain things, I know that I trust authors to do what's right by the characters and the stories they create. I've loved their books and writing for a reason, so even if it's not what I might have hoped for, I know that it's being true to what has to happen to tell the story completely. Especially in dystopian books, these are harsh times and bad/sad things have to happen. I think this book will require some processing time and stepping back to appreciate it for what it is, without gut reactions of not understanding why certain choices were made. But here's the thing: If I didn't care so much, I wouldn't be upset or in tears or in disbelief, and it's because of what the author has written that I care so much. I've always thought: I may not always get a happy ending in a book, but it's the hopeful ending I really want so I can feel comfortable leaving these characters behind and knowing they're going to be okay (even if it might take awhile). After this long with these characters and this world, I'm so glad I got to finish my time with them in one big stretch like this, and that I was left with some hope at the end.<br /><br />Happy Book Birthday ALLEGIANT and Veronica Roth! Thank you for the memories and emotions and experience I got to have reading your books, and especially for the connections I've been able to make with students through your words and stories.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|When I read in the liner notes that Veronica Roth is a devout Christian, I hoped that she would not kill Tris in the third book to make some kind of pseudo-Jesus symbolism. Then she did that exactly, not even really in a meaning way. Tris is not Aslan. Veronica Roth is not CS Lewis. Now I just feel sheepish and foolish for having been so sucked in.

In spite of that, I enjoyed the film, especially the ending.

I WISH I WOULD HAVE NEVER STARTED IT! Life is depressing enough that books should have happy endings. It's your place to escape and find happiness. This book left me so upset. I know the author was trying to show bravery and courage, but all I read was stupidity over and over again. Such a waste of two days!

B000ETQRCM|5.0|Starts off with a 1-2 punch of catchy riff classics Life wasted and Worldwide suicide and many other memorable great songs like Big Wave.  Some nice melllow songs like Gone and Come Back.  I love every pearl jam album and this is one of my favorites.  I don't think there is a bad song on here.
B005LAIIMG|5.0|I loved the protection one dad has for his daughters. The plot of the un takes on to protect the world is a dismal ideology of political calamity.
B0045DO8LK|5.0|This album is a classic.  Plain and simple.  Very melodic and vareity of tempos with an even sound throughout.  Simply one of the best.
B003Y5H5HO|3.0|The book has so much more detail, the movie departed in several scenes from the authors description and from my perspective failed to capture the authenticity of the book.
B00DW1WR14|5.0|Firstly, I will state.  There are only two bands currently I will pre-order albums from, knowing that neither has ever disappointed.  The Black Crowes (or Chris Robinson Solo) and Pearl Jam.  Both have been going for over 20 years and started around the same time and both continue to get better with age and give incredible live performances.<br /><br />The first few times I listened to this album, I just wasn't feeling it.  I was thinking, finally- maybe Pearl Jam will put out a bad album.  After some more listens and especially after seeing them live again, I have changed my tune on this one and definitely like it.  I felt the same way when Binaural, Riot Act and other PJ albums were first released.  There aren't many immediately catchy tunes (like Worldwide suicide, Life wasted, Just Breathe), but they do grow on you after awhile.  Chalk some of that up to Eddies unorthodox lyrical writing. His Lyrics have never been standard. Getaway might be the first tune that I got into...and slowly I started liking the rest.  It took some listing as background music while driving for the short time I've had it.<br /><br />Now having seen them live last night (34 song set!), I've really become fond of Yellow Moon, Pendulum, Sirens, Infallible, Lightning bolt, Mind your manners, my Fathers son.  The raw emotion, tension and tempo changes are there that I've come to love...even in the slow songs you can feel every ounce of emotion Eddie gives in his singing and echoed by the guitars.  The rest of the songs I'm starting to enjoy too, but haven't had enough time to just sit and listen/read the lyrics as every Pearl Jam song deserves. I already know there is definitely enough here to love though and am already plotting to see them live again.  Every concert I've seen has been a highly memorable and special experience.  They play every show like it's their last.<br /><br />I've always been a Pearl Jam fan.  Many \\"fans\\" ditched the band after Vitalogy as \\"grunge\\" faded.  I never bought into the grunge thing so much as a category.  It was always rock n roll to me.  Grunge was more of a marketing term and Pearl Jam is more than a grunge band, just as Led Zeppelin is more than a \\"heavy metal\\" band.  I remember after Binaural, people were saying \\"Pearl Jam is still around?\\" when I brought them up.  Yeah, and they still are going strong today.  As a band I don't think they ever take their lives or success for granted.<br /><br />I'm not sure where I'd rank this in the PJ catalog.  Every album is so different (and that's a good thing).  I'm surprised at some of the reviews on here that disliked Backspacer, Avocado and Riot Act.  I like all of them.  As an entire album goes, it's hard for me to rank...but Yield, No Code, Ten, Vitalogy and Avocado rank higher than this one probably. I'd have a hard time ranking any as a least favorite.  Every album has something to remember.  It's not something I ever felt compelled to do.<br /><br />If you are a real Pearl Jam fan, what are you waiting for?  Just get it.  If you think Ten is their only good album, well I feel sorry for you.<br /><br />It has to be mentioned that PJ always gives you a quality CD package with lyrics, images and artwork.  Not just some cheapass jewel case.  That never goes unappreciated.
B009LDCZDC|5.0|I'm getting old and picky. I've watched thousands of shows and movies over the last 50 years. So it is hard to come by a show that does not ring of familiarity. I just finished the 2nd season of Homeland, and both seasons get 5 stars. I was afraid, especially since patriotism seems to sell so well, that this show would be trite and predictable. It was not. I never once groaned about predictable plot lines, cliches, \\"been there, seen that\\", etc.<br />Kudos to those who had the courage to tell a story that plays both sides against the middle, and to tell a love story without being sappy. And kudos especially to Claire Danes in the role of Carrie. Wow!

B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I've been looking for a reliable device that's able to stream using a multitude of platform/devices and as of late came across the Chromecast player.<br /><br />At first glance the device appears to do what it was designed to do: stream content to the TV. However, upon closer inspection, one can see the various limitations that are put in place:<br /><br />- Extremely limited streaming capabilities on iOS: Have to use the Chromecast app and YouTube app and can only stream YouTube videos.<br />- Relatively laggy for regular home networks and require high-performing internet networks to achieve smooth and enjoyable media.<br /><br />The first point with regards to iOS devices is what makes this hardware so off-putting. I was hoping to use the Chromecast application to stream anything I wanted through my iPhone much like screen capture. In its current state, the player can only do so using Windows.<br /><br />If Google decides to further integrate screen capture streaming with iOS devices, this piece of work will blast all other competitor products out of the market as something that works nearly like a portable projector. But in its current state, it's not worth the price it's selling for on the market.

B00BD99JMW|1.0|I might be able to understand killing off your novels heroine if she wasn't part of a trilogy, but Tris isn't some literary one-hit wonder.  She became a part of our souls and when she died, so did a little part of us.  The Divergent trilogy was never going to win a pultizer or any other real literary award, it was a series built by its loyal supporters.  Congratulations Ms. Roth, you just lost one of them.

B00ERIUO02|1.0|Prism is much better than Teenage Dream. But the whole album is still NOT for children. There are several songs that are not for children the main one is \\"Birthday\\" DO NOT buy this or let your children listen to this! There are some songs that are okay for children but NOT the whole album and definietly NOT the song caleld \\"Birthday\\" so if you hear your children listening to this stop it immediately, also do not let them listen to Teenage Dream almost ANY song other than Firework is very sexually explicit! The title track Teenage Dream, California Dreams, ET, Peacock, Last Friday Night are ALL sexually explicit and NO children should listen to those, if you let your children listen to those you are a horrible parent.<br /><br />Now as for this album there is at least WAY WAY less sexuality...the only major sexual song is Birthday and the lyrics in the other songs are much better, but the major problem with this one is another problem Teenage Dream album had is that it forces way too much high pitched vocals that don't sound good because there's just way too many high pitched vocals in that song...luckily not all songs like are like that...but even the more decent songs are just completely generic and suffer from poor vocals...they're just not AS bad as the others but still not worth listening to. A lot of these songs are clearly influenced by if not directly copying many other songs so the originality is not there, even Roar is highly similar to several other songs including Eye of The Tiger by Survivor, plus the song This Moment copies what made Trapped in The Closet by R. Kelly famous there is no way that similarity was done on accident. Lack of originalty and too many repetitive bad sounding high pitched vocals ruin the majority of the album. Some bad lyrics. Cannot recommend the album has a whole despite the album not being all bad there are some decent [VERY generic] tracks but still not really worth listening to because there is WAY better music out there. This album and the artist themselves is FAKE. This artist never would have had a hit song if it weren't for buying her own radio airtime [confirmed by radio stations] and buying Youtube views [also confirmed by Youtube and VEVO] what ultimately makes these songs just horrible is just the fact of how horrible of a person Katy Perry is. She is a lying, cheating, and backstabbing person who doesn't belong in the music industry. She never would have ever charted if she didn't cheat to chart.

B004K4AUZW|5.0|One of my most favorite albums of all time. I did not care much for the remixes on the 2nd disc, but the country version of Born This Way is  great! There is a lot of songs 17 tracks on the first disc all are real songs and not remixes. This is definitely worth a buy such great songs on here and the songs sound different than most other songs currently being made, that's what I like about Lady Gaga she doesn't make every song sound exactly like every other song by every other artist she actually creates something she wants to make, not just not what will sell best. Many artists only have green in  their eyes while through Gaga's vision she only sees the music notes.
1608871452|5.0|I love the book.  I bought mine to take to the Supernatural convention to have all the actors sign.  The book has so many color photos, outlines all the episodes each season, and has too many details to describe.  Any fan of the show should have this book.

006202406X|2.0|There are so many things I dislike about this book it's hard to find a place to start. It's obvious that Roth is not, as of yet,a brilliant writer. We see that by the first two books. They were carried by a great plot and not by her ability. Allegiant however lacks that. The plot is lackluster, the characters muted and the background story hard to follow and unbelievable. The chapters from Tabias perspective make him seem completely weak and not a person who would only have 4 fears. Yes, we all have know that he is damaged, but in his chapters that is all you see. And the \\"love scenes\\" between Tris and Tobias every other page are almost copied word for  word. You trudge page after page of kissing and misguided youth to *SPOILER ALERT* the heroine`s extremely anti climatic end (Tris surviving the death serum was kind of cool). There was more emotion put into Ureha`s \\"death\\"-which did really suck-than Tris. I<br />get that Roth wanted to end her trilogy different than other dystopian novels, but come on! If you know your going to have your readers up in arms over  ending like that, then you must make the book fantastic. And this just wasn't. The only saving grace this book has is the epilogue, which was th he best part of the book. I actually found some enjoyment and for the first time while reading Allegiant was able to be transported into their world; which is why we read in the first place right? To bad it took the entire book to get there. I will be hard pressed to read another of her books, unfortunately. Be brave...
B00DW1WR14|5.0|More I listen to it the more I love it.  Great sound from a band that has been around for more than 20 years.  I highly would recommend getting this album.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Even before the death that isn't that much of a secret anymore, I wasn't invested in the book.  I kept waiting for the Insurgent volume two to end (keep secrets from everyone! doubt yourself and everyone around you! band together to fight the evil baddies!) and Allegiant to begin.  It felt like there was so little growth in the characters, except maybe Tobias and Evelyn in the Epilogue, that I felt disappointed that I could correctly predict the decisions these characters would make ahead of time.  The beauty of Divergent and Insurgent was that we learned so much about the depths and heights of humanity.  We were surprised by where the characters led us.  In this one, it felt like Roth had a preordained idea of what the end would be, and the characters had been set that way from the beginning to make it work. It wasn't a surprise, and it wasn't a pleasant experience to get to the end of the ride.  I can't imagine going back to the first two now to re-read them or watch them on the big screen, and I feel awful that I recommended this book series to so many people.
0486278077|5.0|Great Price and great quality. Came here fairly quickly too! I bought it for my commute. Would recommend it to anyone who likes books that distance you from the main character.
159463176X|2.0|As a fan of his previous books, I immediately bought and dove into this one. It started strong, but about 1/3 of the way in started unraveling. This book did not have the depth of character development or beauty of prose that his others did. By 2/3 of the way through I was skimming pages just to get through it to see how the story ended. I don't know what happened to Khaled Hosseini with this book. It's as if a different person wrote it.

B00ERIUO02|5.0|This album is on par with her last, every song could be a single and that is how an album should be. Her continued growth really shows with the more mature yet fun sound shown here. The slower ballads really show off her vocal ability while the more mid to up tempo songs show that she can still have fun while saying a positive message. She does need to rely on singing about sex, drugs, clubbing, etc. to sell records and that is awesome.

006202406X|1.0|The word disappointment is too small to encompass my feelings about Allegiant.  The whole format of the book was completely different, almost as if it had been written by a different author than the first two books in the series. While I love Four, I didn't see the need for two POV's in the story.  Now that I've read the ending, which was totally pointless in my opinion, I can understand the rationale for the two points of view, which only illustrates that the author intended to off Tris all along.  I found that after her death, the rest of the book was even more difficult to read and really served no purpose.  What was the point of us seeing the heartbreak of the remaining characters, and seeing no real change elsewhere in the government except in Chicago?  Tris's sacrifice should have meant more, mattered more, than just her friends being heartbroken over her loss.  There were so many avenues the author could have explored that would have served as great plot material.  Why could Tris overcome all the serums when other Divergents could not? What kind of role would she and Tobias have played in helping those in the fringe?  I sincerely hope that if a movie is made for Allegiant, that the producer seriously consider an alternate ending if he wants it to be successful.  I am so outraged right now that I don't think I can stomach watching Divergent when I know what the final outcome will be.  The author didn't just kill Tris, she effectively killed the whole series.
B003VANOFY|4.0|For less then $100.00 including shipping when it was on sale it os pretty good. The mic bends in front of you mouth as well. There is defiantly better sound quality out there (compared to Bose QC 15 headphones). If you own a mac currently you cant get any of the customization software. Rather comfortable and slightly cheep feeling but they are rather cheep compared to other headsets that are worth the money. I read  somewhere you can hook these up to a gaming console but i have not looked into that, I will look into that and make another post.

0143119680|2.0|This novel was written by a college professor with a PhD in scientific and medical history who had specialized in the research of alchemy. The couple of reviews I read were full of praise, and the book was a bestseller in 2011. I expected a serious novel about magic with a historical background. What I read, however, was a spectacularly silly romance novel in the tradition of the Twilight series, with the lovers being a powerful witch who is a PhD historian writing a paper on alchemy and an alpha vampire who is so drop-dead gorgeous that he turns heads wherever he goes. (Witches and vampires are traditional enemies, wouldn't you know it.) We also have daemons, a third non-human species. And a house that adds rooms when guests are coming. And a band of vampire knights of medieval origin who fight for the right. And the goddess Diana. And time travel. Sorry, no werewolves.<br /><br />The novel begins in a promising fashion as the heroine researches ancient alchemical manuscripts, including explanations of how to interpret the drawings and text to reveal the alchemists' understanding of science. But then she requests a volume while at Oxford's Bodleian Library which her witchy senses tell her has been enchanted. Since she has relinquished the practice of magic (long story), she sends it back to the stacks.<br /><br />Very soon the vampire hero shows up, along with a whole library full of witches, vampires, and daemons. They all want the manuscript, which has been presumed to have been lost, and they think she still has it. The powerful vampire steps up to protect her from the rest, and, rather illogically, she trusts him and soon falls totally in love.<br /><br />From that point on, this is a trite romance novel combined with periodic episodes of witch versus witch, vampire versus vampire, and witch versus vampire conflict, often with bloody results.<br /><br />Many questions arise in the mind of a reader:<br />*Will the vampire lover succumb to instinct and bite the witch? Will his friends and family members bite the witch?<br />*What do you feed a vampire for dinner? For the inquiring minds who want to know it's raw meat and nuts and wine, always bottles and bottles of wine.<br />*Will the vampire ever sexually consummate his union with the witch? Although she invites him to on several occasions, he asks her to wait and instead they indulge in some heavy petting, like teenagers in a parked car.<br />*How do you know when a witch has had a sexual climax? Believe me, you will know.<br />*Why would a centuries-old vampire decide to be a servant who cooks all the meals and makes the beds and lights the fires and candles and prepares the tasty picnic lunches?<br />*Vampires call those they have &#34;made&#34; (in the traditional vampire blood-sucking way) their children. If he &#34;makes&#34; her, will the witch become the vampire's child, as well as his wife? That's kinky.<br /><br />About half way through the novel, I began to suspect that author Harkness was having us on. I can't believe an educated historian could seriously write such dialogue as this: &#34;I would rather have had one moment with you--just this one night--than centuries with someone else,&#34; and &#34;I'm not worried you're going to eat me for dinner....&#34; Is it possible she intended a spoof which most took seriously? I know I laughed frequently.<br /><br />I guess this is a step up from Twilight and the rest, because it does provide some interesting historical information, but for the most part it is just silly.

B009XIXVU6|5.0|Although not as gripping as Kite Runner the characters once you figure out how they relate to one another emotionally get to you especially at the end third of the book. Hosseini has a way of getting to the heart. I find his writing & characters quite penetrating, emotional & endearing. I am always sad when I finish one of his books, it's like saying good bye to a good friend.
1451626096|2.0|I always enjoy a Philippa Gregory historical fiction - however The White Princess was a bit too light in providing the usual historical dramatic backdrop. I felt the story focused too much on Henry's distrust of Elizabeth (confused by his desire to have her love him!), his power driven mother (who I kept picturing as Cruella De Vil from 101 Dalmatians) and the unhappy and bored Elizabeth of York. Almost every chapter repeated some or all of the same three themes - with an occasional new character or plot change. It didn't have the depth of character development and progressive plot that I've enjoyed in her other novels.

0143036742|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and am wondering why it took me so long to get to it. It was an funny & unusual story, with some interesting (though not entirely unexpected) events. There were several plotlines going on at once, and I liked how they all worked independently to some degree, but were interwoven so that all parts were connected - some sooner than others - and the conclusion made sense. It's a well written book...definitely worth the read.

0307577589|5.0|I waited a year from the time I bought this book to listen to it, because it was one earmarked for my husband and me to listen to together. Finally a road trip that was long enough for the book, and it was definitely worth the wait. Although I have heard that it is slow going during the first 100 pages, we were pretty much hooked from the first disk. It is true that a lot of set up happens at the beginning, and due to the complexity of the story and a fairly large cast of characters, it does take some time to establish who is who and how they connect. In the end, though, it is worth the time it takes to get acquainted with the characters, because when the story takes off you take off with it.<br /><br />This is an action adventure and a mystery rolled into one, with a journalist as the unlikely protagonist, and yet that element alone makes for a level of intrigue (and a few interesting twists) that ramped up my enjoyment of the novel a few notches more. I can do nothing but urge anyone and everyone who is looking for a ball-busting mystery to read this book. Even better...listen to it! It is 450+ pages of an almost perfectly executed story, even down to the abrupt ending, which is exceedingly effective in pointing you toward the second installment by leaving loose ends and unresolved issues that warrant further exploration.<br /><br />Read it. I urge you. You will not be disappointed.
B0083P1QUM|2.0|Okay. I should have known better!  Patricia Cornwell is known for her meticulous detail in her writing and for her in-depth accuracy and detail in every subject she addresses - be it a leatherback sea turtle or the autopsy and forensics methods utilized in her lab.<br /><br />Her latest Kay Scarpetta offering, BONE BED contains a mind-numbing amount of non-essential information that I really could have done without.  The book did not require all those details, details, details that had little or nothing to do with the multiple story lines.  There was more than enough going on with the disappearances of (1) a female paleontologist, (2) the wife of a wealthy industrialist, as well as (3) the unidentified body found anchored in Massachusetts Bay.  Added to these puzzles were the peculiar behavior of Kay's niece Lucy, the latest in a plethora of problems facing her lead investigator Pete Marino, the obsessive \\"stalker\\" enamored with her husband Benton Wesley, not to mention Kay's own attraction to her new deputy Dr. Luke Zenner.<br /><br />The fact is there was just so much going on in the story that all of the extraneous information provided nothing more than a mind boggling distraction.  By the time the identity of the perpetrator was finally revealed I could barely remember who he was and how he figured into the story.<br /><br />Maybe Ms. Cornwell needs to be reminded that once in a while you can give your readers TOO MUCH of a good thing and that restraint in writing can be viewed as a positive attribute.
9626343230|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. In my opinion, it is an absolutely perfectly crafted gothic novel. It is dark and mysterious, with an air of the supernatural surrounding Manderley and all that goes on there...as if the entire estate is infused with Rebecca's presence. I love the insular, nearly claustrophobic nature of the book. Du Maurier does a superb job of making every element of the novel feel like it is cut off from the outside world - Manderley itself, the cove, the boat, Mrs. Danvers, even the relationship between Maxim & the second Mrs. de Winter. The occasional interactions with those outside of Manderley are exhausting and fraught with anxiety, and though Mrs. Danvers casts a pall over the second Mrs. de Winter's existence at Manderley, she & Maxim both always seems relieved to recede back into their private life there.<br /><br />That the second Mrs. de Winter's name is never revealed is a very effective way of illustrating her second tier status with regard to everyone except Maxim himself. She allows herself to be pushed around and insulted by Mrs. Van Hopper, and feels it necessary to sneak around with Maxim de Winter to avoid Mrs. Van Hopper's rude comments and judgmental attitude. When she arrives at Manderley, she is so intimidated by the illusion of Rebecca that she appears incapable of asserting herself and making Manderley hers. She endures Mrs. Danvers' incivility and subtle evil to the point that I as the reader wanted to shake her until her bones rattled.<br /><br />Although the entire novel is compelling, it is the second half that is full of the unexpected. The unraveling of the truth of Rebecca's demise and the subsequent revelations related to that are done in a way that hold's the reader in suspense until the very end. Du Maurier had an impeccable eye for the mysterious and inexplicable, and she created a dynamic story of unparalleled suspense that culminates in a hugely satisfying way because it is both characteristically plausible and yet completely unforeseen. Outstanding in every detail.t completely unforeseen. Outstanding in every detail.

By the way, don't overtighten the socket arms.  It's not necessary, and will make the 1&#34; ball misshapened, which then limits your ability to adjust the mount.
B00CL0J99K|4.0|Not going to really go in to it, though only thing I didn't like, is it is Digital Copy, not Ultraviolet, so I can't download it to my PC and watch it offline.  Would otherwise give it 4.5 stars if that was an option.
1593157134|5.0|This is an amazing book.  It points things that we all should have been paying attention to in a  manor that anyone can understand!
B00BEIYMIS|5.0|Flat out the best horror film since &#34;The Exorcist&#34;.  It is truly a compelling story that grabs your attention from the outset and never lets go.  Compelling in many respects, at times even its most  quietest moments will have you on the edge of your seat waiting for that suspenseful attack of nerves and thrills.  So sit back on a cool dark evening and put this movie in and see if it fails to capture your attention.  If you have a home theater system make sure the sub woofer is turned up a bit to add to the ghoulish affects.  Enjoy.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this game is totally epic because you can get past levels super easy exept for level 23 it is the hardest level for me
B00E9ZFIMM|1.0|So far I find it impossible to delete an entry or edit, and there is no help or instructions to clarify the functions.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Worth getting. No bugs that I've seen. So much fun and gets very challenging in higher levels. Graphics are cute. Please make pet rescue available for the kindle fire. Thanks
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Other's have been harsh about this book but I really enjoyed it. I only wish the next book was ready to read. This us a great series.
B008Y212PI|3.0|This is a great idea. And I do like it. The 5x5 are way to easy. The 10x10 are a little bit harder. But I finished all of them in one sitting. I wish it was a little more challenging.  It also restatted me back to the beginning several times. Not sure why. I wish there was more puzzles and more challenges.  Overall good.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I cannot believe, first off, how people are completely spoiling this book in the reviews.. With that said, I could hardly put this book down once it arrived on my Kindle. I am not going to completely spoil what's already been spoiled, but if you're hoping for a nice ending all wrapped up in a pretty bow, this one isn't going to do that for you.<br /><br />I did not like the switching between points of view. It almost seemed as if the author didn't have enough material for a full length novel and that was the only way she could come up with to make it work and keep the publisher happy.<br /><br /> (And as much as I've been looking forward to the first movie coming out next year, I am not sure I even want to see it now.)
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Where to start on this....<br /><br />First off: Killing off the main character just felt... pointless. If you're going to kill off the main person that your readers have fell in love with, make it MEAN something. You could have allowed her to survive- easily. Sure, she'd have been badly injured but she could have survived. Instead she died for a bunch of flat characters.<br /><br />Second: The switching POV's I can deal with, I've read plenty of books which used this. BUT, do it right. We all know for a fact that Four and Tris have different personalities, have to have different mindsets- so why don't you show it? I found plenty of times where I'd be in the middle of a chapter but have to go back to the first in order to figure out who's head I was supposedly in. The chapters could have been either aside from the fact that they mentioned the other by name,....occasionally.<br /><br />Third: The writing just plain and simple fell flat. The first two books were filled with descriptions and a moving plot and full of life characters which kept us into it. This didn't- characters were left underdeveloped, the same old plots of a rebellion was used over and over again.... There were plenty of other plot options that you could have done with this whole world outside of this city- instead it was the exact same thing, just in disguise.<br /><br />I was looking forward to this book, now I regret having read it. Hopefully the movie(s) will do this series some sort of justice.... if not, we'll all find something else to move on to I'm sure.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|I love this app it works correctly, u get to play with friends on facebook, u can also win money from the tornament and buy more power ups I cant get better then this :)
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've been waiting for this app to be available! So much better on the big screen, not to mention saves my phone battery
B002Q9MZF6|3.0|Movie formate gives all kind of opportunities to avoid theatrical patterns that exist on stage for centuries. Instead, it seems that you are watching traditional opera on stage.
B00BXUG0KU|5.0|Very nice, liked it a lot will be looking for more. If you like standards she has a great voice.
B003VANOFY|5.0|8 months of use and it's perfect!<br /><br />This is my first 7.1 headphones and i can say that I absolutely love everything about it!<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Wireless.<br />-Games: (especially BF3) are... just... uhh, it's beautiful with the 7.1 Surround system!<br />-Music: are great with these headphones<br />-Movies: are also nice, especially when there is a surround sound, you'll just live the moment.<br />-Can stay for up to 3-4 days before recharging.<br />-Super comfortable.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-There is no mute button.<br />-G1 G2 G3 Keys are utterly useless (at least to me). The only thing I used G1 for is to mute the sound since there is no mute button.<br />-Sometimes it says that only 30 minutes of battery is left, but i can play for a solid 2 hours without any problem. (Not clear battery percentage)<br />-Some say that it disconnect randomly, but i haven't encountered that problem much (only once for the past 4 months)<br /><br />Finally, if you love gaming, music, movies or wireless stuff then this headphone is for you.
B006BFK5DK|3.0|If your looking for that old school EWF this isn't it. But still did a good job and nice to listen too.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|At first I wasn't sure. Before I started this book I admitted to being a huge fan and would read anything this author put in print, but the last two books weren't as good as the previous ones. I can say in no uncertain terms that this book does not disappoint. I liked it so much, I reread it just to make sure it was as good as I thought. Kaleb is powerful, sexy and scary. Sahara is no slouch. The fact that she is Kaleb's conscience and his leash and that Kaleb let her is awesome. This is my favorite in the series. I hope she can keep up this pace. I'd hate to be disappointed after such a lift.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I love Stephen King, he is a great story teller. I was hooked on this book from the first pages..
B0063IH60K|5.0|I really love playing this game, it's clear on the screen, moving the cards across the screen is quick. Hours of fun. Great great great.
B006OAB3ME|5.0|Wonderful music.  Brings back lots of memoris. Finally music I can sing with. Listen in the car and at home.
B003N1I3IY|5.0|I really enjoyed this excellent 'peek through the window' of a very private group of musicians: Their friendship, respect and dedication to guarding one another's privacy has kept them grounded through the trials and tribulations of life while trying to balance meteoric fame against reality.<br /><br />Make no mistake, this is not a concert video like RUSH in RIO.  It is a documentary as the title claims: \\"BEYOND the Lighted Stage,\\" not \\"ON the Lighted Stage,\\" as some have registered disappointment that there weren't extensive performance films included.<br /><br />This is the story of RUSH, shared by the band and with commentary by people they've admired and influenced alike.  How they began, survived touring, dealt with the record company and broke barriers to become one of the only groups to record music that they want to play, not what they are assigned to produce by the studio.<br /><br />Plenty of interesting stories interwoven with humor, poignancy and real familial warmth among the RUSH community; Lee, Lifeson, Peart and their families.<br /><br />I think that one of the reasons RUSH has such a loyal fan base is not only that they are masters of their craft, but that they are good people as \\"...Philosophers and ploughmen each must know his part, to sow a new mentality closer to the heart...\\"<br /><br />A great choice for anyone interested in RUSH, music, publishing, producing...
B00ERIUO02|5.0|Katy and her team have hit a homerun with this album.  It is definitely worthy of a multiple Grammys.  This album is both empowering and inspirational for people of all ages, races, straight or gay.  This album should transcend into any language and country to have the same affect as it is having in the U.S.  I love it!!!  5 stars!!!
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|Forget whatever you feel about Director Woody Allen, this film is uniformly touching and quirky throughout.  If you can't get to Paris, this movie is the next best thing.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Only had it for 3 days, but good so far. Lots of choices on the app for horses and scenery, etc
B0067RQYNW|3.0|I downloaded this app so that I could read word files on my Kindle Fire.<br />It works alright, however I had to dock some stars for two reasons.<br /><br />1. When you go into reader mode, the screen FLIPS.<br />2. If you turn your Kindle from horizontal to vertical, the file adjusts, however when you turn it back to horizontal, you end up pretty far back in the document. I've learned to just make sure to bookmark often so I don't lose my place, but it's a real pain in the butt.<br /><br />What I REALLY like about this is that it allows me to grab documents from my dropbox account. VERY handy!<br /><br />Overall it gets the job done but eventually I may look for another free app that doesn't have the above irritants.
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|I bought this video thinking I was probably going to be disappointed because I love the original Wizard of Oz and thought this movie would be a let down.  Well I was wrong.  I really enjoyed the way it was filmed, the special effects and the story line itself.  Its kind of fun having some background on the Wizard himself as well as the wicked witch!  Definitely a family movie which is also a plus since so many movies today are not.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|So many bad reviews for an author who was adored  by so many loyal fans! This book was literally flogged for weeks on facebook creating a frenzy of anticipation. I really think that Ms. Roth has misjudged her fan base, this is a YA book defined as younger teens up to about 17 years old -- adults can read and appreciate the trilogy but the true fans are the young ones, primarily female, who closely identify with Tris, her tender attraction to Four, her coming of age, her budding consciousness of her physical and spiritual powers. The point of the trilogy is to show how experience changes people, for better or worse, makes them grow and develop and gives them the power to forgive and accept. I really think that Roth's fans would have forgiven her even if she had put Tris or Four into wheelchairs, or blinded them for life, or any other such horrible fate, but to kill off the character with which her readers identify and whom they cherish and emulate, well that is really unforgiveable in a book written for this age group. It is a violation of trust. And I think it is an exceptionally bad message considering the group she is writing for -- To sacrifice yourself for another is an adult decision to be made by adults -- it is a dangerous decision to be handed to susceptible teenagers. Ms. Roth is a young and inexperienced writer, most of her characters are flat and speak with the same voice, her plots are uninflected, monotonous bordering on incomprehensible ( except in the first book, Divergent, which was a brilliant idea), but she  created a fascinating dystopia and a vivid, endearing relationship between two exemplary teens and then she just gave it all up in exchange for what? -- to be judged as a bold, innovative author? -- death and suffering are common, teens don't go to fiction of this kind to repeat what is going on in their own reality, they go there for hope and pleasure -- to be excited and to dream about the future of their beloved characters and their own lives. I simply think that Ms. Roth should have considered who she is really writing for -- not for the odd adult who happens to like teen dystopian fiction, but for the very vunerable young person for whom these books are major milestones, highly anticipated events and beloved memories.
B009RX85N0|5.0|I really love this show and this was exactly as described, the whole second season. Not much else to say. : )
B001NLKXK2|5.0|This story was so well-written and so honest, in its portrayal of a brilliant university professor with early onset Alzheimer's Disease and how it affects not only her life, but that of her family.  It is a must-read for anyone who appreciates honest and authentic writing and difficult subject matter made accessible.
B002KYHZLQ|4.0|Steven Erikson's writing style flows and springs to life in the imagination. Complexities within plots within plots unfold while gentle matters of the heart are touched. All the while fierce magic rages while being hunted by forces on a multitude of sides.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It's a very addictive game, but I don't like the time-outs. I guess they just make sure you take a break once in a while.
B000WEMH3C|5.0|This is a very nice cover fits the grill well,and looks like it will last.I'm using it to cover my Weber grill for the Winter.
006202406X|1.0|Without writing any spoilers I am just going to say, These books really did have so much potential. It is a shame that really the last half of Allegiant ruined the entire series. Veronica Roth clearly does not care about her fans, or she wouldn't have brutally let us down. I could tell what she was trying to do at the end, and in my opinion she did it wrong. I know there can't always be a happily ever after, but if you are going to end things so dramatically there has to be closure. I felt no closure for any of the decisions the characters were making toward the end. The characters were doing things that were not consistent with their personalities, which made the ending so confusing and heart breaking. I don't think I can go see the movies now, Invest falling in love with the characters all over again just to have it all ripped away for no reason, It was bad enough the first time reading this book.<br /><br />Pray they change the ending for the movie???
B002I0J5FG|5.0|Worth every dollar, and relatively cheap for such a great product. The games are short but full of amazing graphics and plots, definitely challenging and a great addition to a collection. Play ICO first, as some plot twists are in store for the lucky players.
B00F35B8F8|5.0|This is a version that has been updated to experiences Gen X, and probably Gen Y can relate to and has that kind of a feel to it.  For the Boomers that grew up with the original series and the Next Generation, it might not resonate so well.
1594202273|4.0|Having once sat an Admin Discharge Board for a person who was caught smoking weed in a special weapons magazine, this all seemed too true...  Except for the adulation of a cowboy who obviously epitomized many of the problems (attitude), the book is very interesting; especially given the current &#34;they're dropping like flies&#34; issues in the missile command (e.g., head honcho cashiered as he'd lost the trust of the nation).<br /><br />If it weren't for some passages that is sounds like he dummied -down to cartoon physics at an editor's request, this would be right up there with things like Chuck Hansen's books, or Schwoebel's book on the Iowa fiasco.
B00A6CCF0K|2.0|Yet another \\"wunderkind with supernatural power\\" rehash. Very linear plotting with a shallow storyline, and nothing more than \\"cameo appearances\\" by characters from The Shining. We don't need it to be LIKE The Shining, but without introducing spoilers, let's just say Stephen King's employment of the Dick Hallorann character in this novel simply falls flat and you're kinda left thinking, \\"Jesus, Stephen...you totally missed a twist opportunity here!\\" And who can't help but want to bitch slap the Danny Torrance character, or at least the rather two-dimensional archetype that was presented to us. Another failing, I'm sad to say. It's definitely an enjoyable read, but, frankly, a big letdown in the end. Or to put it in the abbreviated vernacular of the day, you're left thinking, \\"Hey, WTF?\\" I'm of the opinion that Mr. King is getting a little tired. I've read it over two dozen times, but in order to get over the disappointment I'm feeling over Doctor Sleep, I'm gonna read The Shining again.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Very entertaining!  Smart and believable, this drama has become one of my favorites, and I don't watch much TV as a rule.  This one got me hooked while streaming this summer, and I can't wait to continue the story!
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Love playing this game.  Would like it even more if I could get past lemonade lake without paying to unlock the next adventure.  I would rather pay for the app upfront than get nickled &amp; rimed in order to advance.  I won't be paying.  What a gyp!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I was paying for xbox live to watch Netflix. This little gem of awesomeness is saving me nearly $80/year plus the experience is so much better. Picture quality is better, they load faster and the Netflix Android app is easier to use than the xbox one. This is aunt have device.
0547884591|5.0|This book is a little overwhelming because of how massive it is and the amount of information within it...but it is filled with a lot of GREAT information. I initially ordered this because my sister in law asked for it for Chrismtas. When it came in and I took a look at it, I immediately ordered two more...one more me and one for a good friend.  This would be a great gift for a kitchen person!
B004LWZWGK|5.0|I bought this as a gift and the recipient it a techie, he was very excited and says it is perfect.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|It was just okay...consistent with the others in the trilogy. I was not in love with the story line, but it was an easy read.
B00CW7KK9K|5.0|I love this fitness tracker. It's small, unobtrusive and, most important to me, has a very easy to use heart rate monitor. I've used a number of fitness trackers in recent years and as far as I can tell the Withings Pulse is right up there when it comes to accurately tracking steps taken, calories burned and distance traveled. I also love that I go days and days between charges.<br /><br />What don't I like about it? For one, it's not as responsive as it should be. The button that scrolls you through the various options works great but the touchscreen doesn't.** More often than not I can't get the heart rate tracker to work on the first try. It's the kind of irritation I expect from my $10 dime-store pedometer--not a device that costs a Ben Franklin.<br /><br />Also, the app, which is free, is OK but could be better. Yes, it syncs with a number of other apps that a fitness enthusiast is probably already using but a basic food logger and calorie intake tracker really should have been built in. I love, however, the fact that it syncs seamlessly with my Withing bathroom scale.<br /><br />I bought this tracker for its heart rate monitor, which my BodyMedia does not have, even though the BodyMedia unit is $50 more AND requires a monthly subscription.<br /><br />What I didn't expect to use so often was the clock. A wonderful, thoughtful addition that seems so simple but which took me by surprise.<br /><br />Would I recommend the Withings Pulse? Absolutely. Would I like to see it improved? Definitely, especially if \\"improved\\" means an included food/calorie logger.<br /><br />**UPDATE:  The heart rate monitor in my unit is now working perfectly. Whether this was the result of Withings' last update or I'm just getting used to it, I can't say but it works beautifully now.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I jumped on the bandwagon when this came out and people started talking about it. I was less than thrilled with the story line and wasn't really impressed with the writing, but it was an easy read.
B000I8G5GW|5.0|I watched this as a boy with my father, and recently re-watched it with my own son.  This is among the best of the World War II genre films, and one that does not suffer from some of the issues that most older films suffer from due to the significant technology gap that separates modern cinema from what was possible in the 1960's.  This dates to a time where camera work was key to production quality, there was only so much that could be done with compositing, and there was no such thing as digital effects.  The camera work in this film was superb, and it is still superb, now 50 years later.
B002361MLA|5.0|I can't help but think of what an amazing world we might live in if humanity woke up and lived in the now after reading this book. Also, what if this book were taught in our schools? Instead of having debates about gun laws and bullying and mental illness in an attempt to cure our culture (which is only keeping us in the dark) why don't we enlighten our youth? Teach them that they aren't their thoughts, and how to stay present and observe their thoughts. Or would that be bad for business? When we no longer bought into the fear of our conditioned minds and the thoughts that we aren't good enough and that we need XYZ to be loved and excepted.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I never feel the need to write reviews but I feel compelled to do so with this book. I am truly wondering what on earth the author was thinking! Before reading Allegiant, I would have recommended this series to friends. I would have even put in up there with some of my favorites like Hunger Games and Matched, but not now. I will NEVER recommend this series. Roth totally dropped the ball with this book. It was a horrible way to end a series that could have been great. DO NOT READ THIS BOOK!!!!!. It will make you feel like you wasted your time on the whole series.  I know a lot of people were waiting for this to come out and now they are telling everyone not to read it. In my opinion she shot herself in the foot. Horrible marketing!!!!! Now you are left with people advertising NOT to read the book and NOT to go to the movie. I think you have lost A LOT of money. And WHY? I can't figure out why anyone would ever end a book that way. You have just turned loyal fans against you. You could have had a series right up there with Hunger Games. Not any more! You pulled the rug out from all of your faithful readers!!!!!!!
B004UPANAI|5.0|this gave good insight as to how Wolverine came to be, and his brother too. Answered questions we debated about.
1936608898|5.0|Really has changed my perspective on food which, in turn, has changed the way I eat.  I would definitely recommmend.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|I love to read and watch period pieces.  I don't come from money so have never lived with servants to do all the chores that need to be done in a monster of a home like Downton.  The estate employs a whole village of people.  Imagine living your whole life in servitude.  Eat,sleep and work in the same house.  Looking forward to aspiring to become the Head housekeeper..Things were so different in America, at least for most of the population. I find English life in the 1800 and 1900's very interesting.  Great show.
B00992CF6W|4.0|You can't play with friends who lives far away from you so they added external but it doesn't work. So big Mc a little time and wait and listen to updates I rate this app a 4
B0094M4OW0|5.0|Great old movie.  Have watched it many times over the years .  Action and comedy - our favorite combination.  Next is Bad Boys II.
B00B52FDXQ|5.0|Yes, the blood flies, drips, pools, and generally gets on everything during battles and skirmishes. The dialog sounds a bit strange until you get the hang of it. The first Spartacus is replaced after the first season; but for me, the whole story of Spartacus was thoroughly enjoyable. I'm from Buffalo, and rooting for the underdog comes second-nature!
1451695195|5.0|This item was purchased as a gift. I don't know if they individual receiving this gift enjoyed it or not.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I couldn't wait to get home from work to read it. To see the character grow into an adult and experience real love knowing it will never be what she always thought it should. For her to understand that one has the opportunity to make choices in life even the final ones, was a revelation. It was truly a beautiful love story.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|What's joy without pain? What's love without pain? What's a life without pain? Nothing. Nothing At all... This book is phenomanol
B005723JSQ|4.0|Her books are slightly humorous and always a quick read. This one is not her best but it's worth a read if you like these kind of books.
0740797719|3.0|I wasn't as pleased with this book as I expected, given the description beforehand. I could have done without it in my portfolio of art books for artists. But it did have some new insights that compelled me to give it a 3 star. Otherwise, I would not recommend it to others. To compound the limited benefits I achieved from the writer's offerings, the selected artwork itself,  wasn't my idea of good examples. It served more to showcase this artist's ability (which is evident) in the use of color but not the best examples of interesting applications for the realists, in my view.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Sweet, tender and touching. Lets hope that they do not mess up the movie. A very good representation of teenagers lives. Throw in love, angst and death and you have a modern love story. Enjoy!
B00AEBBA36|5.0|This movie is incredible, and more than that, it's real. This movie is the true story of the heroes that most of America has forgotten.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Enjoyed reading this book on vacation. Interesting twists and turns, story has been told already but ending is thought provoking.
B00F7YHDWC|2.0|Okay, so your probably thinking, &quot;OH MY GAWSH, Y U NO LIKE DUMB WAYS TO DIE???&quot;. Well, I have a perfectly good reason, I HAVE A KINDLE. I dont have a microphone to play the game.I don't have multi-touch either to play some of the other games like the blood stopping one, AND ADS. This is childeren centered right?THEN DONT PUT SLOT MACHINE SIM ADS.again, I love the video,yet the game seems to make it hard to unlock it.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Great way to watch YouTube and Netflix on the TV. Hoping they add Hulu, Amazon Instant, and Spotify. It was a great gift.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I like how I downloaded it pretty quickly. I enjoy these books and I was glad it wasn't so expensive either.
B002QRWJA4|5.0|This movie is as good as it gets especially because of the superb performance of Emmy Rossum.  If it would have been an American movie backed by a major studio Emmy may have been voted an Oscar for best actress.  Terrific in every way!!!!
B009NY43NY|5.0|Bought book on my kindle so did not received it in the mail.. love the series of book but a little upset with how they ended this series.
B00AA0U05A|5.0|Emmy shows her versatility and her independence in this lovely compilation of great songs. She is so versatile she reminds me of the great talents of Judy Garland.
B001TH16DI|4.0|Great set. Nice transfer. Good extras. Enjoyed all the commentaries and behind the scenes. The Captain's Summit seemed to be the only pointless fluff included in this box set.
1931559317|5.0|although it takes some getting used to, it is really complete in it's information.  I think because it is so complete is why it takes some time to use.
B008JFUPK8|2.0|This film couldn't find its direction. Superman was flat and uninspired. I couldn't even find a purpose for Lois even being in this film. I loved Watchman, but Zach didn't hit the mark with MOS. Great effects, but I was bored 20 minutes into this this attempt to relaunch the franchise.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Great game!! You definitely get your money's worth. It's long and fulfilled with lots of puzzles too solve and its pretty addictive. I would recommend this game to anyone.
B00A9ET4MC|4.0|The new novel by the author of \\"Half of a Yellow Sun\\", Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie is simply a delightful narrative of what our dear country Nigeria used to be, that is, a very proud place to be called home, it's present state of anguish and dissatisfaction as well as uncertain future. The love story between Obinze and Ifemelu is just the catalyst. This new offering by Chimamanda is just delightful.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Even though the ending was heartbreaking it's what makes this book so unique! It makes me love but hate Veronica haha but anyways I still love the Divergent Trilogy!!!
B00CDTSFF8|2.0|I really enjoyed this show and ordered this to give as a gift to my boyfriend. Upon arrival the whole bottom of the case was broken and cracked! I even paid more to get the new instead of used. I dont have time to get another before his birthday :( Hoping he loves this show as much as I did and doesnt mind the broken case.
B00EXVZW6E|5.0|Great fun I had with grandson and playing alone.. fun..fun..fun. recommend it for all ages. Very relaxing and a good mine exercise.
B0055QYKQO|1.0|Complete garbage. Never tweeked, never overclocked or anything. 2 months of using it, it starts to restarts by itself. I tried formatting the HDD, restarts during Wins 7 installation. Tried changing HDD, restarts. Tried changing RAM, restarts. Tried changing Vid card, power supply, restarts. I've concluded it's this garbage piece of motherboard.<br /><br />To prove that the other parts worked, I transferred the HDD onto another computer and installed Wins 7 perfectly fine w/o restarting. I tried switching the RAM to the computer too, worked fine. I switched the vid card, worked fine. The only thing I didn't switch is the power supply, but I'm sure the PSU is NOT the problem.
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|I love the game coin dozer, cause its like a real thing and it is 3D.<br />And that's why I like coin dozer.
B000I55YV2|4.0|Wonderful movie! What a great watch. I highly recommend the combo of Prime and Chromecast. Makes enjoying movies like this easy!
B00F3W9NQ2|5.0|I'm totally hooked on this series! It's not your gory, extremely cheesy typical vampire movies..vampire diaries keep you wanting more..Every season is Fantastic in my opinion!
B000GOSVEW|4.0|Wonderful movie! What a great watch. I highly recommend the combo of Prime and Chromecast. Makes enjoying movies like this easy!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|It is a bit of a Pygmalion story with two wonderful main characters whose interactions are written with wit and warmth, understanding and consideration.  Laughter, tears.  So good that I did not want to read another book for a couple of days  - just to relish the memory of this one.  I have already recommended it to several people.
B00BB8Q13A|5.0|Wonderful movie! What a great watch. I highly recommend the combo of Prime and Chromecast. Makes enjoying movies like this easy!
B0089LOG02|4.0|This is a nice story with a sweet twist between young and old.  I enjoyed learning more about the orphan trains that went west from New York.  Worth your time.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|This is a fun game that will surprise you with the amount of time that slips by when playing. It keeps you trying &#34;one more time&#34;.
0061950726|5.0|In a a recent book club discussion on this book, we found that most of us had no idea that the orphan trains did truly exist in America.  The juxtaposed story of a 17 year old and a 91 year old make for an interesting comparison about life in general and about the commonality we all share as human beings.  This is a fairly quick and very interesting read which will keep you thinking long after you've put it down.
B00E9ZFIMM|3.0|This would be great if it would do everything it promises. All I can do is write a note. I don't see a search option, color-coding, back-up restore, import/export, prioritization. I'd like to see a choice of fonts.<br /><br />Seriously, I looked all over the screen, touched everything I could think of. It just writes notes and that's it. Maybe it's because I'm using it on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9\\" tablet. Maybe it's better on a regular android. Maybe it's crippled. If options exist, they are not obvious.
B00FF8OKJE|1.0|that's it in a nutshell.  have fun since the game will not update. tried every trick to do so but no luck. too Bsd wince I love strategy games.
B009POHHRG|5.0|What do you need to say? The Killing Joke and The Dark Knight Returns were the 2 best Batman stories the 80's brought us.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this game! I can't stop playing it, especially the Frankenblitzy room! My 2 yr old loves watching the game too!
B009POHHR6|5.0|A stand-alone superman  story which more than lives up to the franchise. My only complaint is that there wasn't more to read
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|My USB cable did not work and I asked for replacement.<br />I got it for free. New one is working well.<br />Thanks
0452295548|5.0|I loved this book. A fascinating story of a young brain researcher who suffers a stroke when in her 30's. If you are interested in the workings of the brain, you will enjoy it very much. If not, the author suggests that you skip the chapters which are more technical.<br /><br />I loved the spiritual underpinnings, and the positive, heartwarming, hopeful approach to life.
B00015YVD6|5.0|A very good movie that I have enjoyed in the past and now in the present. It is good to have in back in my pr3esent day collection. G.Goff
B007WEQ3K8|4.0|good game great for travel. I sit and play it to pass time and I stay interested. great game for kids as well
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Glad that Candy Crush is finally available on the Kindle.<br />Can continue my addiction and frustration!!<br />I Love the game!
B00BD99JMW|1.0|When I read Divergent in December last year, I was incredulous. I could not believe that there was a book so perfect and well-developed out there. I read Insurgent weeks later, and eagerly waited for Allegiant. I was so excited to read the epilogue, which I imagined to be along the lines of Tris waking up next to Tobias, the love of her life, with kids and a life. Happiness. That is NOT what I got in Allegiant. Instead, I got a crap ending. The whole point of reading is to get away from the real world. Doesn't everyone get enough heartbreak and sadness and angst in every day life? I KNOW that people don't always get their happily ever after. I get it. That doesn't mean that you have to kill the protagonist that the fans have obviously become attached to just to make your point that crap happens. No, that's completely unnecessary. Living in the New York area, I almost got tickets to see Veronica Roth today. I cannot express how happy I am that I didn't get a chance to get tickets because I surely would consider it a waste of money, like I consider that...that piece of crap writing that is considered a book.
B00EKQ3YZI|4.0|First off, while this collection is not perfect, if it's slammed ans sells poorly, we Donna fans can kiss any future releases goodbye. The hi-lights and low-lights:<br /><br />-The Afrojack mix of I Feel Love, the mix of MacArthur Park, the Bad Girls mix, the Hot Stuff mix and the Last Dance mix are my favorite. They all have an upbeat, bouncy sound that is great to jam to. As someone who was not alive during Donna's reign in the 70's and early 80's they are the perfect introduction to younger listeners, who then may hopefully explore the classic originals, which of course are the best versions.<br /><br />-The Sunset People mix has grown on me, it takes time to get used to it, but the uncluttered sound is refreshing. If I had to choose one single song as my least favorite in Donna's catalog it would be Love is in Control, so I was not super excited for that to be the first remix single, but it's actually the one song I like better than the original, well done!<br /><br />-As other reviewers have mentioned, Working the Midnight Shift is sadly a cover, not a remix, what makes it even worse is that it would be amazing if they had just used Donna's vocals! Lastly, the On the Radio mix is not only my least favorite song on the album, but probably one of the worst remixes I have ever heard. To take Donna's amazing vocals and the slow build up from piano to bouncy disco, and turn it into what can only be called 'noise' is a shame.<br /><br />Overall though I am very happy that this album was released, it gives me something fun to dance to and workout to that is still more original than most of the current crop of music out there.
B00CR1DX9A|5.0|A very funny read that had me laughing on every page. The plot isn't overly complicated but as an entertaining read it makes the grade. Easily worth the few bucks I paid for it.
B00DHSK3RM|5.0|Thank you for getting it on the kindle I love this game and it so much better than playing it on my phone. The only problem I had was I had 42 messages on my phone of people giving me lives that I saved up but it didn't transfer over. Otherwise I'm so excited
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|This book seemed forced and a little trite. The best of the trilogy was the first. Katnisseems  seems so whine<br />y and narcisistic.
B00CUKTGJO|5.0|The Clash hasn't been around since the mid 80s, especially since Joe Strummer passed on a few years ago.  There have been a number of compilations but I like this one a lot.  It is soup to nuts, best-of The Clash,  Boxset on the way
B00C5W3SBE|3.0|They show origin of wizard oz, evil green witch, but what it does not have is origin of tinman, lion, scarcrow, or ruby slippers you wnat to know how acting is dont read my review I dont watch  movies judge on acting takes fun out of movies for pure enttainment I leave it to professionals read other reviws about acting and cgi if your type of person who anyalizes every part of movie with impottant thing kept in mind wathcing film for entatinment purpose,.<br /><br />I wanted to see this film how characters became who are there were in dorthy version of wizard of oz origin story you get half of origin story in this film I like prequels to see how characters became who they are now such as batman dark knight joker origin story was complety inactuate to comics as fan of batman but really enjoyed it as batman fan.<br /><br />Good movie but origin story is not as good as it should have been if it showed how ruby slippers were made or first witch whore ruby slippers throught out film, with oz creating scarcrow, tinman, lion being created I would have gave it 5 stars
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I simply could not put this book down. From start to finish, the book just keeps you hanging about what is going to happen next. I totally recommend this book.
B00ET0PZDO|4.0|I like the game. I'm pretty good at puzzles and have a great memory. I  hope it gets more difficult, though. It's entertaining and simple and a good break time puzzle.
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|I tried to download this in my kindle fire but it kept saying I needed to free up ap space but I deleted ALL of my apps and tried to download it but it still said that I had to many apps..... its a fun game but the kindles need improvement..... I was disappointed in my kindle and I am considering getting an I pad mini... its a much better device.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|I have my account set up, and it is a pleaure to watch videos on the devices.  Wether is instructional videos or movie trailers.<br />I Love it!
B00009NQQO|4.0|I got this for my 2 yr old son and he loves the balls more than the net really but he's getting the idea.  It seems durable and suctions well to the wall.  I don't particularly like the bath toys or in this case, the balls, that squirt water because I've noticed if any water is left in them, they have a tendency to mold.  Overall a fun bath toy that my son likes!  I would recommend.
B00514HDNW|5.0|This is a Must read! The movie pales in comparison, even with will smith's lovely presence. This is better than Hollywood!
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Ok. I was so excited to conclude this series after loving the first 2 books. I pre-ordered this book as soon as I could. After spending my time imagining how great this will be. Maybe Tobias will finally get to have his own normal life built with the only person who sees him-Tris. Yeah we get to find out what is on the outside! Disappointment after disappointment! Sadly, my imagination created a better ending than this poor excuse of an ending! How could the author say several times they are eachothers halves and then do that ending?. Seriously! I think I will invent a memory eraser serum to wipe out ever reading this book and make up my own story for the series. Where Tobias gets the life he deserves and maybe some peace. Tris grows up to be a strong rolemodel. Good luck with being disappointed and depressed after finishing this one!
B000B589JI|2.0|I truly loved the idea of this product as my zippo always runs out at the worst possible time.  But I must say that I am pretty disappointed with this product as it leaks.  The seal on the main body is defective and fluid leaks from the canister if it is tilted in any angle.  Possibly there is a fix, but that is besides the point since it shouldn't leak to begin with.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love the challenge no matter how long a level takes. It's both a game of chance and skill.  Beware though. It's highly addictive!
B003VS0CWY|5.0|Everyone loves this classic.  I was surprised when my 16 year old asked me to buy it for her.  She loves the movie and has watched it several times.  A &#34;worth it&#34; purchase.
B005I3PAUO|2.0|To much of a perfect action hero Puller had no flaws,tall(as mentioned on numerous occassions)not a very believable character.<br /><br />The plot plodded along found myself hurrying through the pages.<br /><br />A bit disappointing.
B00CF0ETBE|5.0|CROSBY, STILLS & NASH-CSN (BOX SET): A super group of CROSBY, STILLS & NASH's magnitude deserves a super box set...these four platters serve up all the folky pop hits as well as sterling solo works and various combinations of the three principals (and sometimes NEIL YOUNG), fitting the bill nicely. Covering the span 1968-1990, the harmony-laden highlights are many...the group's hard rocking cover of JONI MITCHELL's WOODSTOCK and spaced out excursion DEJA VU, CROSBY & NASH's FM fave IMMIGRATION MAN, the pure pop perfection of STEPHEN STILLS' LOVE THE ONE YOU'RE WITH, GRAHAM NASH's poignant protest CHICAGO, even DAVID CROSBY's late eighties single DRIVE MY CAR. For fans who think they already have everything, CSN contains a generous clutch of alternate takes (including a nine minute workout of ALMOST CUT MY HAIR), rare live material and a cool cover of TRAFFIC's DEAR MR. FANTASY, making it the very definition of a worthwhile box set.<br /><br />RATING: FIVE WOODEN SHIPS
B0063GORYU|5.0|My husband spends hours at this game and loves it!<br />With this app he now spends more time with me in front of the TV.<br />No cards required!<br />Thanks!
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Very disappointed in this book... I agree that you should just make up your own ending based on the 1st 2 books. Needless to say, I won't be reading any more of Veronica Roth's books and I may not even go to the movies now...
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|Hoping for more of a plot.  Talented actors, too bad their talents were not capitalized on. Glad I didn't buy the DVD.
B0023SDPS6|4.0|The Cold Dish has an intriguing story that envelopes the reader from page one. The characters are relatable and interesting, and the story will keep you guessing until the final page.
B00BAXFDLM|5.0|In my experience, I've never encountered a novel with circumstances quite like the main character of Ancillary Justice. This is a character who - not to say too much more than what's in the main description - used to be a ship that controlled thousands. Leckie does a spectacular job of relaying what I'd like to think the inner workings of a hive-mind would \\"sound\\" like. Sometimes things are jumbled and confused - exactly how they should be, as thoughts of individuals become one of the whole. Occasionally run-ons dictate the character running through one, singular situation from the point of view and reasoning of many. The character's thoughts, being from an AI perspective, are very calculating, which is intriguing - the character reasons based off of extremely small details - almost like a type of Sherlock Holmes. It's intense, and quite refreshing.<br /><br />Overall, the plot has solid sci-fi staples that mix with these unique additions to create something that stands out tall in a time when the media is drudging in a lot of reboots and copies. Give it a read! I'd recommend it to anybody who loves (or even likes) Firefly, especially, or any kind of sci-fi actioner / political drama.<br /><br />But possibly one of the most interesting points I found...<br /><br />(Very minor spoilers following here)<br /><br />The main character, at it's core an AI, was programmed - as all members of the reigning group of the galaxy do - to speak without gender identifiers. It's just how that particular group of people speak. This leads to every character being referred to as \\"her,\\" \\"she,\\" etc. This is fascinating, as the only way you can deduce the true sex of a character is to pay careful attention to gender identifiers spoken by other groups. But, the most important thing here - I think - is that you don't need to. A couple would both be referred to as \\"she\\"s, but it may be a man and a woman, a woman and a man, two men, or two women. Even if it didn't try to be, I think it's a very eloquently written point about gender that isn't heavy handed, and works very well within the boundaries of the main character.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thank you Amazon for finally making this game available on Kindle. I play it all the time and just love it. I'm still trying to get through level 25 and I know eventually I will get to level 26. All-in-all a great app. Thank you Amazon.
B00CNQ7CRI|5.0|ABSOLUTELY hysterical reading! Bridget is my favorite fictional character of all time.  Such smart writing that I am sick with grief that this is the last of the series.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|A simple little game that I thought was fun. I look forward to the next levels...maybe I won't have to resort to the internet cheats as I have gotten the hang of finding and using items.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|This movie was just amazing!  I can't wait for the second one to come out in theaters.  Would recommend to everyone because it is just hilarious!!!  I've been watching it every day since I've bought it. :)
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|Tried this game twice. Just don't understand what all the fuss is about especially when you can only get so far without paying. Only folks who are really having fun are those at King getting all YOUR money. Plenty of other really &quot;free&quot; games available. Uninstalling. . .again.
B00E5N8E2O|5.0|I found the Hysteria replay a little boring, but the bonus features of old Lep was hot. Played alot of songs from my favorite album &#34;High N' Dry&#34;. But everything was tight, and maybe a little slower on the Hysteria set. But well worth the price, recommended.
143353083X|4.0|This is a great study Bible but the printing is so small it is hard to read-people I know really like it
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Worst way to end a series.  Depressing. Very disappointing.  Zero Stars. I would rather have never read this book and imagined my own ending. Killed the wrong character. Why do Authors think killing characters makes for a better book? You ruined the whole series. I understand disposing of lesser characters due to the plot but this was just wrong. Wasted money on three books. For a story about nothing. Just that everything is Damaged. Way to go Roth. Would go into more detail but I hate ruining books for others.
B00F8GYC1Y|4.0|This game is as fun as the other angry birds and if your a star wars fan it's a fun play.  some challenging levels and always good to play while you wait for your kids at tumbling or wrestling or whatever other event your playing taxi for this week.
B004SIP7F8|5.0|Dazzling performances by the actors in this movie, combined with a tragic compelling story, haunting music and evocative scenery combine to make this an unforgettable film.  I tried reading the book years ago and didn't understand it.  This movie made everything clear.  The relationship between Ralph Fienne's character and Kristin Scott Thomas's character was riveting.  Passion, heartbreak and tragedy against the senseless backdrop of the war shows the heartache and unspeakable loss in human history.  A film in which everything emanates quality. Most films can't live up to the novel on which they are based.  This may be one film that does.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|This was our book club's selection of the month and everyone thoroughly enjoyed her honesty, integrity, and massive sense of humor.
B001AIRUOU|4.0|This was a replacement for a lost dvd.That should tell you that we like this movie an awful lot. : )
B008DL466C|5.0|My grandson age ten taught me to RAP a couple of months ago and this is the music which we used to learn. It is so invigorating and upbeat. I urge every one to give it a try.
B003UAKE9Y|4.0|We enjoyed this movie in theaters and thought it was good halloween time viewing. It may be a little too scary for very young children.
031623480X|5.0|I've always known that simple carbs are bad and I appreciate the the lucidity and confidence with which Perlmutter arguments his case against them. I found the book so educational ans so clearly written that I've ordered another copy to hand to my mom too.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|He has a captivating way of making whatever he writes familiar. Research, history, details made relative. Book two catches us up on all the major players from book one and introduces us to the next generation. You can read book two as a stand alone but there is so much to lose by doing so. Don't let the size of the book deter you. You will be begging for him to hurry with the next one.
B00FWLDHSY|4.0|Well this movie proved to be good find. I was leery at first suspecting it to be a cheesy CGI stew with bad acting but I was surprised. The movie had good effects, a decent story line (I mean it is aimed at teenagers mostly and kids) and was steady on the action front. There is little cursing and no sex. It focuses mostly on action and the story. It is a safe family movie with the only violence occurring towards alien characters. They did a great job with the massive machines and the animation.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|A tale of a German girl who survives the Holocaust. Narrated by death. He revels in the sublime beauty and horror that is the human condition, and is haunted by humans that he feels he is continuously overestimating or underestimating. But if it is possible for death to love a human, death lives Leisel Meminger, the book thief whose life is shaped by words...
B008HJGPVO|5.0|This stylus works great and is easy to hold.  For me, the most important aspect of it is that it eliminates grease/smudge marks on my Kindle screen!
B00AJER3SE|5.0|I've been waiting for this movie to come out on Blu-ray for quite some time. I was hesitant to buy it due to some of the reviews I read on Amazon about the other version(s). When I finally read the reviews on this version, I bought it right away. The picture is great for a movie made back in '84! It almost looks as good as T2 when it first came out. The sound is better than I thought it would be. If you're a die hard Blu-ray buff and like to be REAL picky about the quality of 30 year old movies working on 21st century technology, then you'll probably lose some sleep on this one. But for the rest of us, it's a winner!
B003EY7IRC|5.0|This book is an amazing book in the Fever Series. I couldn't put it down and when I HAD to put it down, I couldn't stay away for long. Keep in mind that this is more of an adult book, so parents should read them before deciding whether or not to let your children read this series, particular this book, if I remember it correctly. The books ran together like I really long movie to me.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My daughter wants to play this game everyday when I get home. Its so much fun and so stinking cute!
B000B8IA2G|4.0|the more I watched it the more enjoyment I obtained from it.<br /><br />Many years before on standard TV I watched one segment of this series caught in the then 'RUSH' of my life. However this year (2013) I collected all 5 Seasons to add to my SG-1 Series. I have found that this Series 'grows' on you the more you watch it, and it's certainly well done too as the previous 10 seasons of SG-1 are. Everything links together.
0385333846|5.0|Loved this book! Couldn't put it down. Vonnegut is a genius. Of all of his books, this is my favorite.
B00AZMFJYA|2.0|Frankly, I certainly don't understand 'why' so many individuals liked this movie? It took me two complete viewings of it to understand 'whom' some people were suppose to be in it compared to the original characters from other earlier 'Star Trek' movies. The story line was a little strange too. When this movie is NOT in my collection I won't miss it.
B002ELIXCA|4.0|awesome...refreshingly diabolical! Love the characters and the development of each....the Ice Truck killer is the best villian I've seen on TV. Way to go Showtime!
B000067DNC|4.0|Nothing exceptional in this Season. It's just another season in the Series of 10 that you need to view to complete the whole set. You need this Season to understand what the next season will start out with and so it goes with all of them including the 5-Season Atlantis Series & the remaining 2 Evolution Seasons. Several of the separate movies entwine themselves among the various seasons too. I own everything SG-1 made. I honestly believe that all of the money that I paid out to accomplish my complete collection was money well spent for the HUGE amount of enjoyment involved with almost 245 hours of watching time.
B0095R3D0I|5.0|This movie is a great family Halloween movie. My son loves it and my wife always insists on watching it multiple times every October!<br /><br />It's a very good good movie all around!
B00F56AZK4|5.0|I love this app!it may appear simple but it is enough for a tired brain as mine.  Stay to work the puzzles and see just how easy they are.  I enjoy each puzzle.  They are challenging without being sucked into an aggregating yet raucous game.  These puzzles bring out a healthy, competitive spirit that one may have missed when first observing the puzzle.  I find them to be very relaxing and fun.
B004UFEJXK|5.0|My son loves this movie and I have to tell you, I do too! It is funny and really has a good lesson in it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love that the Kindle now has the app, i can now score my Kindle Fire HD a 5 Star rating!!!
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Enjoyed watching, again & again. The effects are amazing. Will probably watch a few more times!!!! Hope others enjoy it as much as I did!!!!
B004DLPXAO|3.0|The app for the kindle for android is okay. Not sure why I can't access all my books from different devices (Laptops, PC's and phone) Some of the books aren't accessible, which is a bummer.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|In the first half very boring  . In the climax mild action Then the ending was like a slap in the face .I mean after all that there is still nothing for them to look forward to And now I'm all sad over the turn of events. I think they deserve a little peace after all that.<br />  Now for the characters.  First of all my favorite character in this series is Tobias. In divergent he was a badassed legend that everyone respected in this book however he was painted as some whiny emotional pansy total personality flip. He also would have never done some of the things in this book in the others he is strong willed and would never gone along with what one person said without developing his own opinion first.  And for Tris she has a bit of a holier than thou attitude going on. In the other two books she was a person who never judged and was a bit more understanding to some people so she could have understood Tobias's actions and reasoning a bit more.<br />  In the end I am ok with harm coming to the main character and actually find it a bit refreshing but in this case I think a break would have been nice for the two cause they went through so much
B000AOEMXM|5.0|I enjoyed this series.  Wish there were more.  I really like the way they ended it. Surprise Surprise.<br />We ended up watching a lot of the extra stuff, just because we were not quite ready for it to be over.
B00459EZ7Q|5.0|One of my favorite TV shows. To bad it's all done, with out being finished. I think if it would have had more time to air it would have been a bigger hit.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Everyone should get this game, it is really fun for all ages! Can set and play this game for hours without getting bored!
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|The movie was great it was so good that I wish I could have it for free I am Chris 8year old daughter Bri
B00E9ZFIMM|3.0|I don't know what they consider to be &quot;Pro&quot; about this app. There are absolutely no features. There isn't even a save button. To save the note all u have to do is hit the back button on ur phone. I got a free notepad with many more features than this one. The description says they will be adding more features soon so maybe then it will be deserving of the &quot;Pro&quot; title. If I remember to check on it again I'll update my review when more features come out.<br />Other than the misleading title it is a good basic notepad. If u don't want a bunch of strange options or ads to navigate around just to write a note, then this is a good one. I wouldn't pay for it at this point though. If they have updated it then disregard this review. U will know they've updated it since this review when it has ANY features at all. lol
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|I don't really like it so much because 1. When I first got the game it won't let me change my username and 2. If u take to long u get kick out of the game and u still lose ur coins :(
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I am completely in love with this unique yet versatile rendition of the Bible.  Included in this app are different versions of the Bible.  If you're a traditionalist, you can select the King James version.  Not a traditionalist? Then you might want to select the English Standard Version. I have my app set on audio which allows me listen to scriptures (and you do not have to belong to and audio book club in order to use the vocal settings).  The app is filled with other features like a calendar, daily scripture quotes, bookmark, highlighting abilities, and allows you to create your own study plan.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I love this type of story. I guess I'VE found a new author. Can't wait to read the next books in the series.
B00E0SX118|5.0|I would recommend this to every one in the world. I think this was REALLY hopeful and romantic between guy and eep so sweet see people get punched by a monkey a the first ever fit but also see what REALLY cool things happen
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Great app for weather and news!  You can collect mPoints and donate them or win prizes.  It gives you videos for exciting news and you can get very detailed weather forecasts.  (You have to have an account to use your mPoints.)
B005L38QK2|5.0|I brought for my brother. He like play computer games. Though this is not the new design it is really nice.

B00ERIUO02|5.0|I excitedly pre-ordered \\"Prism\\" by Katy Perry (deluxe version) due to my previous music enjoyment of \\"Teenage Dream\\" (from 2010) and a strong intuitive feeling to purchase this collection. I am glad that I followed my psychic hunch because many of these songs are happy and symbolize a message of cheerfully relishing  various facets of life.  There is something for many men and women in \\"Prism\\" such as the being unstoppable and resilient in life through the song \\"Roar\\" and being in love with someone who is a kindred spirit to you: such as through the music track \\"Double Rainbow\\".  Obviously, I'm fully aware that personal song favorites are going to be as varied as the listeners of \\"Prism\\".  My personal favorites are \\"Birthday\\", \\"International Smile\\", \\"Dark Horse\\", \\"Legendary Lovers\\" and \\"Walking On Air\\".  However, there are many more music tunes to enjoy on \\"Prism\\" such as \\"Unconditionally\\", \\"This How We Do\\", \\"This Moment\\", \\"By The Grace Of God\\", and \\"It Takes Two.\\" \\"Prism\\" (deluxe version) by Katy Perry is definitely recommended if you enjoyed Katy Perry and/or you like music collections sprinkled with pop, hip-hop, and eurodance melodies.
