B001ECQ4HG|5.0|I love this movie I use to own it on DVD and I lost it and frankly I'm glad I did because I only buy blu-rays now and to have one your favorite movies if all time on blu -ray is great.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app on my kindle fire. Loads pictures quickly and very easy to use. I would definitely recommend it!
B000FCKGPC|3.0|I like the book but it is definitely not as good as the first 3 - SO FAR - I am 50% of the way through it. I find it difficult to get through the many chapters that are introducing new characters or characters that were very minor in the other books. Meanwhile the glaring absence of the characters we have come to know and care about it, is distracting. Sometimes I feel like I'm reading an entirely different series. I can't wait to get away from the \\"Iron Men\\" characters who frankly are very boring and get back to Jon, Daneyers, Tyrion, Bran etc. That being said, everytime I am about to get really bored, Martin throws in a character I know. Just enough to keep me interested. I am slowly beginning to see how all of these stories and people are eventually going to connect. I like this this book series enough to be patient and wait. Again - I'm only half way through so everything could change.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|This book is another opportunity for all Riordan fans to revisit and learn more about the world of the demigods. This time, the series starts off with a fresh batch of new characters that are no less appealing compared to the other characters known in the other books. We also see the return of some familiar faces, and a little bit of character development. This book is a MUST READ for all of us fans!!! Prepare to be entertained!!
B003AWRM9W|2.0|I love the movie but ! it has been so chopped up from W B. That it is almost hard to follow. I have the original on VHS and it is very different.
B0053TMP24|5.0|All hail the return of the almighty Percy Jackson.<br /><br />Rick Riordan's Denigods have certainly come a long way in terms of character development and world building.  I am so grateful for the effort Rick Riordan has expended in writing the second book in the series. This book does NOT disappoint!!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great book.  It had me from the beginning of the first book all the way through the third!  50 Shades of awesome!
1423140605|5.0|I have read all the works of Rick Riordan, And I must say - I'm one of his biggest fans. Riordan's progress from the author who wrote Percy Jackson and the olympians to the Mark of Athena is nothing less than remarkable.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I always enjoy Rick's work. Nothing like reading a great story with your kids. My son and I read everyone of his books and now my daughter is joining in.  We loved this book.
B0063S3DMK|5.0|This was a required assignment I gave for a social inequality college class.  Everyone was totally engaged and felt that the movie made a significant impact on their perspectives about culture.<br />Star
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|As always with Rick Riordan's Percy Jackson books, this is fantastic. It took me 2 days to read it, and it only took that long because I only got to read on the train to and from work, and a little bit after work.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|Some of my favorite songs are on the Deluxe Edition. It is totally worth the extra few dollars! The price is also better than on iTunes.
B003JTHWJQ|4.0|Richard put into works what I thought all along. Thank God (pun) for the kindle dictionary, I really needed it!

B008OJIBH8|5.0|Just received my amazon.com exclusive spaceship version of this set, and it is awesome! I won't review the film/Blu Ray itself here...I think we ALL know about the movie by now...But the Spaceship edition is well made (although, they could have done something a little better on the paint job..), and includes the batteries for the operation of the movement/sound. The size is very big, I was expecting something smaller, but the sound quality, lights and movement really add something a little magical to the experience of going to get the disc to watch the movie. If you were one of the lucky few who got one of these sets before they sold out...You won't be disappointed!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This movie rocked!  I was a little apprehensive about the hype and my expectations being too high, but this movie exceeded the hype AND expectations, at least for me.  It was funny, with lots of action that moved the story along nicely.  This is a DVD that I will watch over and over again.
0316228532|5.0|J.K.Rowling's novel, \\"Casual Vacancy\\", should be on the book list of every psychology class in human nature.  She went right to the depth of who we are.  I am amazed at her insight and the way she wove a tapestry of human nature, in a pleasant read.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This was an excellent book--a legal thriller.  I was surprised by the ending but enjoyed the whole book starting at page one.

B00992CF6W|5.0|its out on the kindle now and better than ever. I got block story earlier AND IT SUCKED. the controls where horrible and the game laggy. minecraft has smooth gameplay and controls. a person below me stated that they couldent find diamonds. there is diamonds because I have a diamond pickaxes and sword and 14 extra diamonds so keep digging. next update on this they are adding the nether.

1423140605|3.0|I was really excited to devour this book, but it was a little less than I expected. It didn't fully satisfy my desire for another, and I sort of feel like it was sort of a segway to the next book.  I would wait for a better price. Overall, though, it was pretty good.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Beautiful interface. No complaints yet.  I now prefer surfing Pinterest on my Kindle Fire to surfing on my iPhone. All issues have been resolved by restarting my kindle.
B001RPIYV4|4.0|basic wear and tear, but the disk looks clean. Ill let you know when I use it if it works right or not.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Excelent reading. A great look at the history as Ken Follett's first book (The Fall of the Giants). I would recommend this book to those people which has  never lived in communism or fascist regimes.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Like most Sylvia Day fans, I was on the edge of my seat waiting for the release of Reflected... I even scheduled its release on my calendar so I could plan around it knowing I'd be tied to my Kindle as soon as it came out.  And as expected, she did not disappoint.  I had to re-read Bared several times just to keep my Gideon fix satisfied!<br /><br />My heart was racing through the drama... I couldn't believe the emotions I was feeling for Eva throughout the book.  I couldn't even work until I finished the book because I couldn't wait to see how this particular story would close.  Once again, I'm left on the edge of my seat until Entwined is released in December.  Well done Sylvia!  Happy to say I'm on my 2nd re-read of Reflected and it's still as fabulous as the first time!
B000ASATYO|5.0|Some of the dialog was a bit cliche and predictable; but overall a M.J. Fox classic. Saw it in theaters and I'm happy to finally have it on DVD again. Its a must-have for any movie library.
B008AT71WI|5.0|First of all, I don't have to tell anybody about how truly great and timeless this film is. The funny thing is that I don't really like musicals all that much but I love this film. (Rocky Horror Picture Show is the only other musical that I actually like a great deal not counting Cannibal: The Musical which is making fun of musicals). Frank Oz directed the hell out of this film and the entire cast is on fire throughout and Audrey II still stands as one of the greatest puppetry/animatronic achievements in film history. In fact, I put Audrey II up there with the stop motion animation in the original King Kong and the skeleton fight sequence in Jason and the Argonauts. It's truly that great and the fact that in 1986 CGI was still way in its infancy (Tron and The Last Starfighter had very early uses of CGI prior to this film), that meant they had to do everything the old fashioned way and the movie is all the better for it.<br /><br />The blu-ray of this film was long overdue but very much worth the wait. I never thought that we would ever see a day when a fully restored director's cut would get an official release featuring the original ending that was deemed too dark and hated by preview audiences. But Warner Brothers pulled out all of the stops and worked closely with director Frank Oz and a lot of the creative team to reconstruct and finish the original ending. You also get the choice the watch the theatrical version too with the upbeat/happy ending and to be honest, each ending has its merit. But being a big fan of giant monster movies, you can't beat in the original ending seeing multiple Godzilla size Audrey II plants demolishing a city in various hilarious ways.<br /><br />The film was fully restored and it looks truly amazing and blows away the old special edition DVD easily. Detail has taken a massive leap and this is most apparent in Audrey II. No matter what version of the film you watch, the quality is just as great with one ending as it is in the other. Contrast and particularly black levels are very much improved too. From what Frank Oz states in the extras, there were only a couple of optical effects shots in the films and I believe that those are in the original ending so since everything was done for real and live on set, there aren't many instances where you get a soft or grainy shot due to the process that was used at the time for optical work to be accomplished.<br /><br />The sound is in 5.1 true HD surround sound and sounds better than ever. I didn't have any problems with the mix and at no point in any of the songs were the vocals in danger of being swallowed up by the musical tracks. The movie has never sounded better that's for sure!<br /><br />All of the extras were ported over from the special edition and a couple of new goodies were added for the blu-ray including a 10 minute featurette discussing the restored director's cut, why the ending was changed originally and what had to be done to get the ending finished and then how director Frank Oz was blown away by what Warner Brothers was able to accomplish. The other new extra (or at least I believe it's new) is a new 20 minute commentary that Frank Oz gives over the newly restored original ending too that is well worth a listen.<br /><br />This blu-ray is well worth every single penny and a no brainer in terms of upgrading from the ancient DVD. The fact that you get both the restored director's cut and the theatrical cut too via seamless branching plus all of the DVD's extras and some new ones makes this an easy contender for catalog blu-ray release of the year in my eyes.

0425263908|1.0|If you read 50 Shades of Grey dont read this book!!!! So much the same I got so mad i threw the book out by the 3rd chapter. I held out to see if it would change and go off into a story that didnt seem to mirror everything in 50 Sdahes of Grey but no... Waste of money if you read the Grey Series
0321714113|2.0|I'm sure there are a myriad of other reviews on this book, so I will get straight to the point.  I am a novice programmer and I had to use this book as a textbook for a programming class I am taking.<br /><br />Issues I had with the book:<br /><br />1.  Very often, the guiding factor in how the examples are written is how much ink it takes to print it the \\"technically\\" correct way versus the \\"real-world\\" correct way.  For example, you will like get 5 or 6 chapters into the book before the authors even acknowledge that it is possible to create code blocks by enclosing statements in curly braces.  Technically, you don't have to for a single statement, but most programmers use them to eliminate ambiguity.<br /><br />2.  The variables.  This may be a matter of preference, but I always use variable names that are full words.  I don't want to go to the trouble to remember that int i2 = 12; while int i3 = 33;  It is inefficient and annoying to sift through the author's rather nondescript variable names, especially when they stack up correct and incorrect statements on top of one another.<br /><br />3.  This book was released for sale 7 days before the start of the Fall 2012 semester.  I have found numerous ambiguities and errors, specifically in the introduction of pointers and references.  Often the author will state one thing and provide an example that is the polar opposite of what was just stated.  These statements tend to appear about 1/2\\" from one another.  Consequently, you should get really familiar with cplusplus.com, stackoverflow.com, and msdn.  You will be using them frequently.<br /><br />4.  The author tends to be pedantic about trivial subjects and then gloss over critical concepts.  I forget how long chapter 2 was, but suffice it to say that brevity was nowhere to be found.  Lippmann attempts to kill his readers with one pedantic bludgeoning after another with the minute details of the differences between short, int, long, long long and so forth.<br /><br />5.  Blame for this should probably fall on my school, but this is not a good intro or reference for beginners.  I use it, to be sure, but often times the internet is a far better resource.<br /><br />6.  The assignments suck.  They aren't hard, but they will bore you to sleep.  We are halfway through the semester and I turned in a program last week, assigned from the book, which simply involved throwing an exception for dividing by zero.  That's it.  The authors don't really strive to make the problems interesting  or challenging.  Some students might like that.  I don't.<br /><br />7.  The last of my major issues with this book is that the authors are horrendous about defining a variable in a different section, having three or four pages of text in between and then using that variable defined four pages back to initialize a new variable.  So, prepare to do a lot of page flipping if you don't have a photographic memory.<br /><br />I will end my review by saying that this book does not approach the subject of learning C++ like most any of the books you have used before.  Oreilly, New Perspectives, Apress, and Addison Wesley--I've used technical books from all of these companies--my experience has been that these publishers typically locate someone who is an expert in the field (if not the architect of the language himself/herself)and who is capable, indeed eager, to speak in a comprehensible manner and teach others about the subject.  C++ Primer 5th Edition does not have that tone at all.>5.  Blame for this should probably fall on my school, but this is not a good intro or reference for beginners.

B007I5QNRE|5.0|this book is awesome... love the integrated videos!! Very helpful with improving my drawing skills.  The lessons are from a professional master artist.
B005X5XIL0|5.0|I think this concert is one of the best Andrea has ever done! The quality of his voice has exceeded anything he has ever done. I think he will have a hard time topping this but everytime I say that, he manages to top any of his previous work. I have a collection of his DVD's and THIS is the best of them all. Concerto all the way!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Excellent game play.  I highly recommend this game.  I think I played for 2 hours straight the first time I opened it.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Lots of action right from the start. I highly recommend this movie for the entire family. There are some good humor parts asz well.
B005VMVUAQ|2.0|Being a Cage fan you realize two things. There's movies that he fits in perfectly too like Bad Lieutenant, Gone in 60seconds, etc. and then there's movies that our buddy Nick just doesn't belong in. The Wicker Man, National Treasure, THIS MOVIE! This movie is a terrible waste of Cage. I kept cringing at every seen just hoping they would shoot him and put him out the misery of being in this film. I mean I already saw a film like this called Hostage a long time ago and that was a waste of Bruce Willis. These rich people getting robbed movies sure have gotten old. Well at least in this movie the guy is actually broke (Post Bush era I guess). I enjoyed that particular twist in the film but that was about all that was interesting. I just kept watching the film hoping that Nicholas would put on his Cage powers and make the movie become worth watching but to no luck the movie just sort of runs on with him just getting beat up like a rag doll and then it just ends? I don't get the ending. Did they run out of film budget? Did they not think of a way to do a 5months later theme showing him and his family happy and smiling together? No, it just turns to black and role credits. Ultimately that also made me feel like I wasted my time if the directors were too lazy to even finish off their bad movie properly. It's like they realized no one was going to make it to the end of the film so they just cut it off. I get the feeling that this film is really some rich Hollywood director/writers attempt at some political message that only the 1% get. As for the rest of us 99% this was just an all out bad film. I knew it was going to be bad as soon as I saw Nichole Kidman in it. Batman,The Others,That movie with her and Tom Cruise I forgot the name of. She seems to have the luck of being in movie that suck. Oh alright I take that back I actually liked Batman Forever a lot... I just didn't like her.
0061148512|5.0|One of those classic reads that you want to pick up when you are alone and have time to savor each word.  Chosen by our book club, this goes on the list as one of the best written books I have ever read and provides a vast arena of discussion for our next meeting. Plath gives the reader an inside seat in the world of mental illness/depression and the struggles therein.  Dark, but the author uses superb imagery and takes you along on this woman's struggle for sanity/reason. Excellent!
B003O86FMW|4.0|...another great installment in the Hunger Games series.   Can't wait to read the last (but sad also).  Great story line.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Read this book and your heart will be touched. The moral of the story is in the title. How do you handle feelings?Either good or bad.
B0063IH60K|3.0|This game is a solid, well done basic solitaire game, but before you can play after each deal you are given an ad. Some are simple single-screen ads and some are full 15 or so second commercials. I find this very annoying but because I got this as a faotd I expect the developers to do what they have to to make a profit some other way, so I've kept the game and I play it, just not as often as I might if it didn't have commercials.
B006L9KRHU|5.0|I would recommend it to anyone responsible for money - be it small or large sums, private or corporate. The book is a great lesson on how our emotions can throw us into a neverending financial problem spiral. The beauty of the book is that we can deduce from it, how not to get into such situations in the first place! An outstanding \\"financial thriller\\" even for those who cannot tell \\"futures\\" from \\"options\\", based on authentic experiences of a man who caused an entire bank to go bankrupt.
0385344333|1.0|I'm a huge Child/Reacher fan! Read all of his books (twice). I completely agree with the review that \\"Reacher creature\\" wrote. Way too repetitive, flat, dull story, boring characters and terrible ending that goes on and on like a maze.  The only one decent person in the story gets her head blown off! I could go on, but what's the point, save your money! A real let down to fans. This was either a sellout to fans for the money or, Lee Child didn't write it. I won't go quite as far as the \\"Reacher Creature\\" reviewer and say I'll never buy another book, but I'll never pay full price or pre-order one of his books again. I'll wait for them to be discounted.<br />Disappointed loyal fan:(
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|A match three (bejeweled -type) game in a quest setting.  The levels are hard enough to ne interesting with a few power-ups to help you along the way.  A fun time killer that works great on the kindle fire.
B0087DFIYA|1.0|This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Poor directing, horrible writing (have you listened to the dialogue?), poor cinematography and an idiotic story.<br /><br />Prosecution rests.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|In the end Christian turns out to be a good person but still likes the real kinky sex, but Ana seems to enjoy it too.  Christian had such a terrible beginning until he was adopted. Elena was the worse thing that could have happened to him in my opinion.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|Great movie. Simply awesome. A must see for anyone who liked ironman, the hulk and thor. This movie was simply great. I would watch it again.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|The storyline  keeps you interested. I couldn't put the book down.  When I reached the end of the book I was disappointed that I'd have to wait for another book to be written to see what happens next.
0786890762|2.0|Let me start out by saying that I think Cecelia Ahern is a brilliant writer--extremely talented. This book, however, was just torture. I enjoyed it for maybe the first 100 pages. The next hundred made me feel irritated, and by 300, I was skimming. I think the concept of all correspondence might work as a shirt story, but to make it into a novel in length, she just had to pad it with stuff the reader isn't really interested in. What we are interested in is getting Rosie and Alex together, and that plot--the main plot--is like Chinese water torture to our souls.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Awesome, great read. Hot, emotional, and hot! Can not wait for more.... Please don't let the story end.....I love the story line and the turmoil of their relationship, very real with the exception of an extreme amount of wealth, but the story is totally believable.
B009GEEMLY|4.0|If you like Marvel comics then you should like this movie. Was very action packed. This movie is more for adults than for young children.
0316228532|1.0|Having read and re-read the richly allegorical Potter series, I was hoping for a novel as thought-provoking and endearing but at an adult level.  After reading 130 pages, \\"The Casual Vacancy\\" just doesn't deliver.  The characters aren't likable, or even interesting;  the drama and story seem pointless.  I really don't care what happens next, there is nothing compelling in the first 25% of the book that makes me want to keep reading.  Rowling describes her characters dispassionately, much like Stephen King... many times I actually felt like I was reading the beginning of a Stephen King novel, just waiting for the first sinister or other worldly event to occur!  The problem is:  nothing like that happens, and the only real horror lies in wasting one's time reading about these characters' dreary, colorless lives and musings.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I love this book. Every time i read it, i will cry. even if i know what is about to happen. You love me real or not real? Real.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|meh. fun for a bit, but it gets pointless and boreing after awhile.  its just another pointless game on my kindle fire :/
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Game is fun and addictive but a little too addictive since I beat it in one game. Glad it was free because I would be disappointed if I had paid $4.99.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|Brief summary:<br />Thomas wakes up in an elevator with no idea where he is and the only thing he knows about himself is his name. When doors open above him, he's pulled out of the lift into the Glade, a place full of boys between 12 and 18. The Glade sits in the middle of a maze that huge stone doors open up to every morning and close off every night. Only one new boy is sent to the Glade once a month like clockwork, which is why everyone is so confused and suspicious of Thomas when a new GIRL is delivered the next day. Everyone, including Thomas, thinks he and this girl have a connection, but he can't figure out what it is. His memory block becomes even more frustrating because this girl has a note clutched in her hand that will change everything.<br /><br />What I liked:<br />It's been a long time since I read a book where not only was the main character memorable, but also all of the supporting characters. Thomas is so very human in the face of everything before him. He risks his life for people he barely even knows and cries when he's terrified. It was so refreshing to read about a boy that has all the qualities that make a person human. So many books paint boys as tough and indestructable, but Thomas has better attributes. He's caring, selfsacrificing, hard working, beaten down, scared, hopeful, confused, angry, heartbroken and a number of other things. He acted how any normal person would act in the face of all he went through and that's what made it so easy to feel like I was there experiencing everything with him.<br /><br />What I didn't like:<br />The beginning is a little slow, but it's necessary for the world building. You need to get an idea of what they've all been through and how desperate they are to get out.<br /><br />Brief thoughts:<br />Amazing! It's been so long since I've read a book I enjoyed so thoughly, one where I know I will remember the characters and the feelings I have from reading such an amazing book. Thank you, Mr. Dashner, for writting something that I'll be thinking about for weeks to come.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|If you loved the first book in this series, you'll love this on as we'll.  The author did not disappoint.
B00914JWSW|5.0|Thank you so very much for this amazing album.  Your song selection is incredible, the number of songs you had to go through, I'm sure, is numerous.  You continue to provide us with excellent music from 5 decades and you sound beautiful in all decades.  \\"I Think It's Going To Rain Today\\" is absolutely mesmerizing.  How many of the new \\"singers\\" could do that with just a piano accompaniment?  \\"Didn't We\\" is the version Jimmy Webb was always hoping to hear.  \\"Willow Weep For Me\\" is so Simply Streisand that it gives me goose bumps.  \\"How Are Things In Glocca Morra\\" is as gorgeous as a Rainbow.  Need I go on?  Whether you are 20 or 70, if your music is old or new, whether it is from your vaults or found laying around somewhere, it's all outstanding.  It's always the very best and it's always a special event whenever you release anything.  Never stop releasing these wonderful treasures.
B006VFLIYK|2.0|The book never felt real.  It was  Sam Spade in the 21st century. I would NOT recommend the book or the author.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|After reading 50 shades I felt like no book would be able to live up to it but I found myself loving this book series more than 50 because the writing style wasn't so repetitive like 50 shades was, and it was more exciting to read. I like the character Gideon better than I did Christian and liked Eva over Ana bc Ana was so naive and Eva is a very relatable character. I can't wait for the next book to see what happens in this series but I hate that I have to wait another 2 months. I got through this one is a day, I couldn't put it down at all!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|So much fun to play! I could not put it down. I will recommend this to all of my friends
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I don't read much fiction but this book held my interest and I liked it.  I'm not sure if I'll read the trilogy but if I can get the book as a bargain I'll do it.
0425263908|5.0|After reading Fifty Shades of Gray, I thought I wouldn't find another series of books like them; but, I was wrong. This was a great book. I enjoyed the story and can't wait to read more about the relationship between Eva and Gideon. I have introduced the book to my friends and we all loved it. Keep them coming Ms. Day.
B0041KKYEW|1.0|Very disturbing film.  The story was difficult to follow and contained nudity, strong language with lesbian sexual scenes as well as psychotic material.  The only good point was that we rented the movie rather than buying it.  Do not recommend at all.
0525952926|4.0|I was reluctant to start this book.  We know the history of Germany in the 30's and 40's and I did not want to see characters I had loved and followed during the first world war hurt.  However, once I had read a few chapters, I couldn't put the book down.  Excellent reading.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|Terrific free app. Does all the basic math functions you'll need for routine daily business. Great addition to my Kindle Fire collection!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I was a very sad :( when I finished reading Fifty Shades. Shortly after that a friend of mine suggested I read Bared to You. I went out and bought it and was ADDICTED!!! Love.... Love.... Love.... The Crossfire Novels!!!
B007U77Z40|3.0|This album is not the best Running Wild album but might not be the worst either. Fans of Running Wild should pick this up since it still has that Rockin' Rolf riffing that we all love. The songs are hit and miss on this one and some riffs sound like they may have been borrowed from older songs, which is actually fine by me.  Also, this is hands down the worst album cover Running Wild has ever used and in my opinion one of the worst album covers I have ever seen. WTF?
B00881VLCE|4.0|Nice variety of free puzzles and can chose how many pieces. The only thing I don't like is the puzzle pieces are lined up but you can arrange based on piece type. Addicting and fun.
1449410243|2.0|I've followed The Oatmeal for years now, checked his site regularly, bought his books, supported his kookie causes (Nikola Tesla museums,) etc. etc. etc.<br /><br />Why?<br /><br />Because this guy makes me laugh; he is an excellent comic that takes down-to-earth material, makes it completely unrealistic (or sometimes too realistic,) and comes out on top almost every time. This book, however, really disappointed me. As much as I love his cat comics, you can only use the same joke about nard-licking, leg-clawing, face-sitting cats so many times before it gets old. I felt like very little of the Oatmeal's wild creativity went into this book, even though he had a limited theme of cats vs. the world. Also, full page comics are great when they aren't being used as 20-page filler to make the book appear worth the money. I hope to see more in the near future - hopefully, another book like the first to draw the Oatlets back in after this flop.<br /><br />BORROW this book from a friend if you want to find out more about the inner-secrets of the enigma that is the felis catus.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Great Read.  I had just finished 50 Shades and was looking for another Christian!  Guess I am partial along with many other Christian Fans, but I loved 50 Shades! I am awaiting the next book by Sylvia Day.  Happy Reading....
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This is a very fun and decently challenging game... also its pretty long which surprised me as well worth the price.
B008XG1X18|5.0|you have to learn how to spot the spam (not hard.) so many awesome things, though. can't tell you how many times I say, &quot;I saw _______ on pintrest.&quot;
0451228375|5.0|Ken Follet writes medieval masterpieces. He can take you back with his words so you can almost hear the sounds and smells of the era. I loved Pillars of the Earth and I think World Without End is equally invigorating. I watched the miniseries for Pillars and am excited to see World which premieres tonight. Watching is nothing like reading it but I find myself appreciating his talent for historical fiction even more.
B008G8SFGO|4.0|I was not going to purchase Monster but wanted to check out the \\"Magazine\\" version at Wal-Mart for a project I am working on. I ended up giving the CD a few listens and realized that it has some great straight-ahead rock and roll built around a Zep-style \\"Wall of Sound\\". There are a couple tracks that are average but overall if you are a classic rock fan, you will enjoy this collection. \\"All For The Love of Rock and Roll\\" is one of my favorites since it sounds and feels like the first three KISS records (\\"Mainline\\" comes to my mind). I love hearing Eric and Tommy singing and I would LOVE for the new guys to do their originals in concert. I hope KISS incorporates 4 or 5 tracks from Monster on their tour.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is a great read. All kids should read this book to give them any idea of what  the world might possibly be like if something bad happens.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|This was a very compelling book. Being a mother, my heart broke for Jaycee's mother through the whole thing. I can't begin to imagine the endless suffering she endured those 18 years not knowing where her daughter was and what she was enduring. Jaycee was and is an amazing young woman. I pray that the God of all comfort will completely heal her heart.
B0084I9QI2|4.0|The box are so beautiful!!! a many exclusives performances ! I just don't like the package, but the material is very especial for fans !!
B003KRJNBW|4.0|This was a good movie that both my wife and I enjoyed. Had some good twist and turns that keep you watching. Beautifully shot.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I can't wait for the next book to come out.  This series is comparable to the Fifty Shades series, but still enjoyable.
B004GYY714|5.0|Tried this ap out and it is great !! Plenty of stations to listen to in most any music type you could want. Time to cancel xm !!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The season 3 premiere of \\"The Walking Dead\\" had plenty of what we watch the show for, ZOMBIES.  There was enough dialog to progress the story line, and plenty of ZOMBIES.  A new character is introduced along with her pets, ZOMBIES.  If the rest of the season continues the action, and leaves out marital fidelity problems, I'll have a diversion from the Midwest winter misery.<br /><br />I wish to thank Amazon for making the series available on their streaming service.  Conventional cable is not available at my rural location and my satellite provider (Dish) has decided to force their customers to switch to other services.  Amazon has come to the rescue.
B0013FSXT6|5.0|I fall asleep every time I watch it, but it's a great film. It's a good buy for blu-ray because there are scenes where the sets are amazing, and plus it's a classic.
B005LBF7CY|4.0|I loved it, but it wasn't her best. Daniele Steel is an incredible author. She grips you from the moment you read the first line of her books. The way she describes her subjects in her books, one feels as though you know them personally and the descriptions of the places that she mentions, you almost feel that you are actually there.
B001KZVQJI|5.0|This movie is just awesome. Some people seem to not like it, but I don't see why. The cast does a great job. The music is just amazing. The story is a classic. This movie has a beautiful look. It's one of my favorites and if you haven't seen then you need to.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love it.  Plain and simple.  Everything about it was hot, sexy...amazing.  I'm on my 3rd time reading them all.  James...you better write the Christian version!
B0018QCXH8|5.0|Look for once in your life be a man! Stop beating yourself up over things that happened in the past, it's the past get over it man! You need to look forward with your head held high. Now take a couple deep breaths and let out that man roar that has been living inside you for far too long! Now and only now you will have become a man, and will be able to buy and watch this movie!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I love it.  Plain and simple.  Everything about it was hot, sexy...amazing.  I'm on my 3rd time reading them all.  James...you better write the Christian version!
B002QFYJF4|2.0|This movie is a movie that makes you think, and makes you think yourself into nowhere. It's like deciphering old Egyptian code to find out it has some lame message. The performances are really good, but it doesn't matter because the movie is to nuts and takes you out. I really think P.T. Anderson was trying to create something brilliant and almost did, but didn't and there for it really sucks. The best part of this movie is the song by Aimee Mann called \\"Save Me\\".
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love it.  Plain and simple.  Everything about it was hot, sexy...amazing.  I'm on my 3rd time reading them all.  James...you better write the Christian version!
B004LK5CEE|4.0|It's a cool movie. I would say it's a perfect date movie. It has a lot of extras, mostly James Cameron giving back story to stuff.
B004SBQGHS|1.0|I am unhappy that the ad-free version on Amazon shows up as the free, ad-supported version on Google Play. Now, Google Play shows that the app needs an update. If I update, I get all the ads. Why! I have the paid version of the app. I hate ads.
B001GMH8SI|5.0|I had no idea this movie was going to be as good as it was. It is a great movie and pretty sad. Even though no college boy yuppie really gives up his trust fund life to truly live, I guess when it does happen it's so rare they make a movie about it.
0525952926|4.0|Winter of the World, is the sequel to Fall of Giants. These book continues the story of the five families, featured in the earlier book. This book starts in early 1933, when Hitler comes to power, in Germany, and the story takes in this pre war period, the Second World War, and the immediate post war age.<br /><br />I found the story captivating from the start, with fascinating characters! The tumultous era is vividly recreated in this book. The parts set in Germany under the brutal Nazi regime,are particularly sad. I would highly recommend this series, and look forward to reading the final book, when it comes out.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|this was not the type of book I would normally buy.  And I will not buy any of the sequels.  I like a good story; this was just weird sex.
B004YM6JK0|5.0|Great product! I love this series! Supernatural is my favorite tv series. if you've never seen it watch one episode and you'll be hooked...then come to Amazon and start at the beginning by purchasing Season 1. Amazon did a great job of shipping it when they said they would.
B00910Y1OQ|3.0|The graphics are nice, the controls and playability are high-quality, and storyline is an added plus. This is definitely a high-end match three game, with bonuses, obstacles, and varying boards to play on. However, it lacks a continuous play/ randomly generated game feature. This leads to a finite use, and at the price point ($5) is really not worth it. Unless the price comes down, or more is added to this game, I regrettably would suggest passing this one up.
B007THA4FI|2.0|Not my favorite...I find her writing style difficult and her characters not well developed, or rather disjointed.  I am disappointed and would have returned the book had I purchased it traditionally.  Sorry...I had been anticipating its arrival....
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|I started with the VHS set. When the DVD set came out I prchested it and was impressed by the difference in picture. When the Blu-Ray version I jumped on it. All I can say is it blew my socks off. Picture and sound are out of this world. All I can say is that if love Indiana Jones this is a must have!
0316228532|2.0|Had mediocre expectations for this book, despite loving the Harry Potter series, and I am still disappointed.  In my opinion, it has a very slow start, uses too much British slang (makes it difficult for an American audience to follow at times), is short on plot and a little on the dark side.  About 3/4 through and haven't finished it yet because I don't find it to be an enjoyable read.  I do not recommend it.
0345803485|5.0|I am not an avid reader, but this books kept my interest.  And needed to purchase the next two in the series.  Anxious to see the Movie that they are talking about making.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|This is the second book in the Gideaon Cross series. I did not enjoy it as much as the first novel however it was a good light read. After FSOG, this is the next best thing. I have read some of the other knock offs that were rated 4 star and they don't come close to being to the level of quality of this book. However, to get a 4 star rating (like FSOG), I would have liked to see more of Gideon revealed, and a little less of Eva's dependency (she was all over the place). The pet names were annoying and parts of the book came across as contrived and not very beleiveable (i.e. old boyfriend never getting over Eva when all they seemed to have was a convenient sex thing). That said, I will buy the third book and look for a resolution to the Gideon and Eva story.
0062082353|4.0|I enjoyed reading Chris Kyle's story. I appreciate Kyle's service for this country.<br /><br />I found the book to be very fascinating - Kyle details his early and life and goes through great detail with what training and determination it takes to become a SEAL.  I wish he would have gone into more detail with specific shots, but the book rather outlines multiple skirmishes, etc.  He also paints a good picture of what a hell-hole Iraq was while he served. I would recommend this book.
B006FTC6ZC|5.0|Just trust me on this one. It's a great movie. I'm not here to write a review, I just wanted to give it the 5 stars it deserves.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Love love loved it!! so good. fits perfectly in the series.great to have Percy and Annabeth back together. can't wait for house of hades.
B008MZPVP4|5.0|I have been listening to Down since I was twelve and they have yet to put out a disappointing album. This particular album sounds more like Down's second album Bustle in Your Hedgerow. I would recommend this to ANYONE AND EVERYONE THAT HAS EARS!!!! If you only listen to one band for the rest of your life it should be Down!!!!
B008LZHA3G|5.0|For years Bob Dylan has managed to put out very great albums every so often. Even after 50 years as a recording artist, he can still pull off an epic effort. \\"Duquesne Whistle\\", \\"Pay In Blood\\", \\"Early Roman Kings\\", \\"Tempest\\" and \\"Roll On John\\" truly stand up well. Enjoy 'em!
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is so addicting and you cant just play one game you have to keep playing it and playing it and u always try to beat your high school
B000002G8H|5.0|What can you say? Nothing beats this 1977 effort by one of rock greatest guitarists. Amongst the songs-\\"Lay Down Sally\\", \\"Wonderful Tonight\\", \\"Cocaine\\" are true gems. Highly recommended!
B003ODIZL6|1.0|this book is the most boring and outdated book in th universe now I know why its free dont read it i fell asleep since they dont let me rate it 0 ill rate it 1
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I love the game .I can't wait for the second one .I hope it is better than the first one
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|While I was pleased with the ending, getting through this book was painful.  I felt there was about 2 good pages per chapter to read.  This was not a \\"can't put this book down\\" kind of book.  What got me through is #1 because it's a trilogy and I had to finish it and #2 because I was told it gets better.  I even looked up to see what happens to see if it was really worth completing it.  Catching Fire was definitely the best book of the collection, would have been nice to extend the book and just finished it there.
B005LAIHZY|4.0|I'm glad to say that Pixar has righted the ship with their first venture into the fairy tale genre. The story, though not as original as previous releases, is still very engaging, and the voice acting is spot on. Any caveat I had with the story is more than made up for with the visuals; the movie looks beautiful, and I'm still scratching my head as to how they created that full head of red hair.
B0053O89RY|5.0|love modern family , my granddaughter, bought me one and two.  have enjoyed watching them without commercials and in my own leisure and time.
B000PC6A3E|5.0|The superhero movie that wasn't afraid to be different. Instead of creating a world that was fantastical and \\"comic booky\\", Christopher Nolan decided to take the franchise in another direction and introduce a Batman that existed in the real world. Christian Bale is great as the caped crusader, and it has everything you would expect from a Nolan film; a smart script, terrific editing, and incredible action sequences.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|I don't usually play games like this one.  I usually go for the puzzle solve ones or the strategy games.  This is a very nice diversion that's very fun to play&hellip; yet doesn't. require a lot of thought.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Christopher Nolan accomplishes the impossible by bringing his third and final installment of the Dark Knight legacy to a satisfying and extremely entertaining close. Christian Bale gives, in my opinion, his best performance as the title hero, and while Tom Hardy's Bane may not have the unpredictability and chaotic nature seen by the Joker, he does a great job at coming off terrifying and menacing, all with a mask covering most of his face. The film doesn't quite meet the standard set so impossibly high by it's predecessor, but it doesn't need to. While it may not stand quite as tall on it's own, it concludes the trilogy in a spectacular and satisfying fashion. It's a remarkable feat to string together three movies so seamlessly, which only increases by respect and love of Nolan's films.<br /><br />The BD set itself has a lot of great extras, including a bunch of featurettes on the making of the film. I've always been a fan of Nolan's work because of his insistency to do as much as possible without CGI. The making of the plane scene is astounding and it's remarkable that only a few shots within that scene include the use of CGI. I also enjoyed getting an inside look into how Hans Zimmer created the score for the film.<br /><br />This is a great set if you're looking to finish your collection of the Dark Knight trilogy. The movie is great and the features are very entertaining. I highly recommend it.
B0018BF1J0|4.0|Update: Lou, you'll be missed. This is a terrific set to revisit Lou's music and life.<br /><br />An exceptional collection of Lou Reed's first five studio albums (minus [[ASIN:B00004VXF2 Metal Machine Music]] which most fans will be grateful for)this collection gathers Reed's best early work all in one place. The CDs included here are the remasters as far as I can tell and we get the bonus tracks included on \\"Transformer\\", \\"Sally Can't Dance\\" and \\"Coney Island Baby\\".<br /><br />The CDs are housed in mini cardboard replicas of the original sleeves (well, except for \\"Sally Can't Dance\\" which uses the back of the CD insert as far as I can tell)in a larger lamenated cardboard box with a listing of all the tracks on the back.<br /><br />For the cost this is a terrific set and my only complaint is that I do wish that there was a sheet with all the credits for the album (the print in a couple of instances are a bit too small or, in the case of \\"Berlin\\", the handwritten credits are a bit difficult to read).<br /><br />The tracks:<br /><br /> 1 I Can't Stand It  Lou Reed  2:37<br /> 2 Going Down  Lou Reed  2:55<br /> 3 Walk and Talk It  Lou Reed  3:41<br /> 4 Lisa Says  Lou Reed  5:32<br /> 5 Berlin  Lou Reed  5:13<br /> 6 I Love You  Lou Reed  2:20<br /> 7 Wild Child  Lou Reed  4:43<br /> 8 Love Makes You Feel  Lou Reed  3:13<br /> 9 Ride into the Sun  Lou Reed  3:13<br /> 10 Ocean  Lou Reed  5:04<br /><br />disc 2<br /><br /> 1 Vicious  Lou Reed  2:55<br /> 2 Andy's Chest  Lou Reed  3:17<br /> 3 Perfect Day  Lou Reed  3:45<br /> 4 Hangin' 'Round  Lou Reed  3:32<br /> 5 Walk on the Wild Side  Lou Reed  4:13<br /> 6 Make Up  Lou Reed  2:56<br /> 7 Satellite of Love  Lou Reed  3:39<br /> 8 Wagon Wheel  Lou Reed  3:19<br /> 9 New York Telephone Conversation  Lou Reed  1:32<br /> 10 I'm So Free  Lou Reed  3:08<br /> 11 Goodnight Ladies  Lou Reed  4:20<br /> 12 Hangin' 'Round  Lou Reed  4:05<br /> 13 Perfect Day/Transformer Radio Spot  Lou Reed  4:51<br /><br />tracks: disc 3<br /><br /> 1 Berlin  Lou Reed  3:23<br /> 2 Lady Day  Lou Reed  3:38<br /> 3 Men of Good Fortune  Lou Reed  4:36<br /> 4 Caroline Says I  Lou Reed  3:57<br /> 5 How Do You Think It Feels  Lou Reed  3:42<br /> 6 Oh Jim  Lou Reed  5:09<br /> 7 Caroline Says II  Lou Reed  4:13<br /> 8 The Kids  Lou Reed  7:49<br /> 9 The Bed  Lou Reed  5:51<br /> 10 Sad Song  Lou Reed  6:56<br /><br />tracks: disc 4<br /><br /> 1 Ride Sally Ride  Lou Reed  4:00<br /> 2 Animal Language  Lou Reed  3:00<br /> 3 Baby Face  Lou Reed  5:01<br /> 4 N.Y.

B007K3JFUQ|5.0|This sequel managed to do something that's isn't seen very often as of late, which is to be better than the original. The story was more cohesive, the cinematography was stupendous, and I could actually understand what the characters were saying this time around. Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law have great on-screen chemistry, which they've perfected for this sequel. Oh and by the way, the forest scene is jaw-droppingly good.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I love this game. It reminds me of fishdome. Very relaxing game. Helps takes the stress away after a long day.
B007L4HFDI|4.0|Though it's full of some cheesy dialogue and bits of overacting, \\"Spider-Man\\" is still a great superhero movie and, in a lot of ways, paved the way for the success Marvel has had. A lot can be said for the film because it appealed not only to nerds and geeks, but to the mainstream movie-goer as well. Tobey McGuire may not have been the perfect choice, but he gives a great performance as the title character, which I can't say for Kirsten Dunst and Willem Dafoe.
1401322786|5.0|I loved this book!  What an interesting way to get people to stop and smell the roses, and appreciate the time we are given here on this earth.
B000UR9T8C|3.0|While the third film in the Spider-Man trilogy has some great moments, it has some painful ones as well. I'm not sure what is more ridiculous; James Franco riding a hovering snowboard with bad makeup, the length of the film, which overstayed it's welcome by at least a half hour, or emo Peter Parker dancing down the street. I will say however, that most of the effects involving the Sandman are pretty great, and some of the action sequences are fun to watch. All in all, there are way too many characters, and the film seems like it was just thrown together.
159420411X|5.0|If you're a fan of Nate Silver and his 538 blog, The Signal and the Noise  will not disappoint. When I first received my copy, I thought I would never be able to finish reading it. So much information! Well, I haven't finished reading it yet, but my initial concerns have dissipated. Like his blog posts, Silver makes understanding data palatable (perhaps even addictive). It's been a very satisfying read - chock full of information without being verbose or boring. Highly recommend!
B0092QITO2|3.0|Total Recall is...meh. There's some good action to see and some fun to be had but there's also some pretty bad dialogue and a weak plot to get through. Farrell and Biel do pretty well with what they're given, but Cranston is extremely underutilized and I'm not sure how I feel about Kate Beckinsale's Terminator-esque attitude. The movie went through a lot of production woes so hopefully there's a more satisfying Director's Cut to be seen in the future.
0553455532|4.0|I had never read anything by John Grisham when a friend loaned me a copy of The Partner.  My friend had just finished it and was eager to discuss it, most especially the ending, so I started reading.  The first chapter was so incredibly good, well written, fast paced and wonderfully exciting that I just kept going for several hours. The story was well thought out and had twists and turns that were unexpected and interesting.  The lesser characters were a bit lightweight, some fleshing out of their personalities would have enhanced the story. There were too many lesser characters. I did not mind the ending, it caught me by surprise and I like that.
B005LAIHE0|4.0|The Five-Year Engagement's biggest strength is the chemistry between Segel and Blunt (whom I love). I was expecting a few more laughs but found the film to be quite touching and heart-felt. I sincerely hope this is a breakout role for Chris Pratt, who absolutely owns every scene he's in, along with co-star Alison Brie. Some scenes drag on a bit, and the movie as a whole could be shortened considerably, but all-in-all it was an enjoyable movie with a good message about marriage and love.
B004HWT6DO|5.0|I regularly watch this movie. I typically do so when I am doing an all night coding tear because it just puts me in the mood to be a total winner.
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|If I were to describe this movie in one word, that word would be \\"perfect.\\" From the incredibly tense opening scene, to the thrilling final frame, The Dark Knight doesn't miss a single beat. Bale is, once again, great as the Bat, Nolan is so inconceivably on his game, and Heath Ledger gives one of the most memorable performances in recent memory. It's one of those movies that will be remembered for a long time to come, and it's made it's way onto my all-time top five.
1401322786|3.0|Albom's latest fable, \\"The Time Keeper,\\" features interesting characters and taut, lyrical writing. In both style and substance, the novel parallels the work of Paulo Coelho. However, the story is like being immersed in a fairy tale with no witches or ogres. Time itself is the antagonist, but not a very potent one.<br /><br />Story:  The inventor of the world's first clock is punished for trying to measure God's greatest gift. He is banished to a cave for centuries and forced to listen to the voices of all who come after him seeking more days, more years. Eventually Father Time is granted his freedom, along with a magical hourglass and a mission: a chance to redeem himself by teaching two earthly people the true meaning of time.<br /><br />Spiritual/metaphysical content: Low. The book contains simple snippets of insight destined to become \\"quotable quotes\\" about the nature of Time. For instance, as man begins to count days, then hours, then minutes, \\"the counting consumes him, and the wonder of the world he has been given is lost.\\"<br /><br />My take:  Mitch Albom's latest spiritual fable examines Time: how it began, who set it in motion and why, and how the repercussions play out upon the rest of humanity. The slim volume tries to answer the questions, \\"What is the meaning of time,\\" and \\"Why does God limit it?\\" However, the answers are simplistic and don't add much insight to the body of metaphysical fiction that addresses the human experience of time. In fact, \\"Ferney\\" by James Long presents a brief history of time, so to speak, that does a much better job of analyzing this difficult subject.<br /><br />However, Albom does throw in some unexpected turns and solid character development, a flare for illustrating human connections, and a pleasant writing style. One passage reflects the tone of the story:  \\"If one were recording history, one might write that at the moment man invented the world's first clock, his wife was alone, softly crying, while he was consumed by the count.\\" The novel strives to be both poetic and prophetic, but it's more popcorn snack than spiritual feast. \\"The Time Keeper\\" is a fast and interesting read, but there's not much here for the seasoned spiritual seeker.the count.\\" The novel strives to be both poetic and prophetic, but it's more popcorn snack than spiritual feast. \\"The Time Keeper\\" is a fast and interesting read, but there's not much here for the seasoned spiritual seeker.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|There's really nothing to complain about with The Avengers. The acting, script, action, comedy, special effects...it all works. Flawlessly. This will go down as one of the greatest superhero movies of all time, and has set the bar so high for any comic book adaptations that come after it. Fantastic!!

B007MDB71O|4.0|John Carter is not without flaws. Some of the plot points just don't make sense, and the editing is mediocre. With that being said, there's quite a lot that the film has going for it. Many people are turned off by Kitsch, but I find him to be a likable enough actor that does well with the material he's given. The visual are astounding, and the motion capture effects are really great. The true problem with the movie lies with the marketing campaign, which failed to give a hint as to what the movie was actually about. It's a shame that it performed so poorly at the box office, because I would definitely like to see a continuation of the story.

The songs were great, the casting was terrific (especially Russell Brand and Alec Baldwin), and who knew that Tom Cruise had musical chops?! The movie is completely over the top, which works to it's advantage because it never takes itself too seriously.
B008O9V4C2|3.0|I can always count on something unexpected and welcome from Fagen and his last solo project 'Morph the Cat' was no exception. I love that quality that has so permeated both his and the almost always stellar output of Steely Dan.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Sunken Condos does not lie in that pantheon. A surprising disappointment actually. All simple, predictable funk grooves and changes with lite-weight, two-dimensional lyrics. Backing tracks and horn arrangements are stock. Even the solos are bland.<br />Where are the \\"gotcha\\" changes, the snarky, innuendo-laden lyrics - the clever stories, the humor? This is kindergarten stuff for Fagen. I dare say, even lazy.<br />And also surprisingly, the always reliably amazing recording quality is dense and flat.<br />Oh well, I hold huge respect and admiration for Donald and will always be a fan. Even the best can't always hit a home run. Better luck next time.
B002ZG980U|5.0|Everything about this movie superb. The cast, the editing, the pacing, the special effects, the music...it's all terrific. The movie seems to burst with creativity and originality at every seam, and has proven that there's still some original ideas in Hollywood. In Nolan we trust, indeed.

You'll see about two minutes of back story before the intense and bloody violence begins, and don't expect it to let up anytime soon. The fights scenes are great and the choreography is marvelous, especially in the final fight scene. The director does a great job of building tension in the film and introduces a lot of wildly inventive action shots.

You'll probably be surprised!

It was nuanced with her challenges and internal struggles.  I was really looking forward to an evening with this movie and a glass of wine.<br />The movie was a great disappointment.  Julia Roberts portrayed her character with very little depth and I actually never cared for Elizabeth.  I found her whiny, needy and stupid.  There was also zero chemistry between Elizabeth and Felipe.<br />This was 2 hours of my life I will never get back.  And I feel it soured me on the overall book experience also.  ugh.

B00729GQ0A|5.0|This was an excellent read. It's a supernatural romance that has urban and realistic elements that don't stray too far from your imagination so you can actually relate to the characters. Speaking of the characters I simply love the story of  Sophia & Charles. The chemistry between them is so intense. Sophia is a really great character so you're invested and engaged in what happens to her. You find yourself rooting for her and Charles despite the fact that he's brought her into his dangerous world. But you feel assured that he'll take care of her and honestly her new life has to be a lot more exciting than being a waitress.

0345536886|5.0|Like many authors I like, such as Stephen King, who I really enjoy, Grisham has had a hot streak then some not so hot books in the mix.  Maybe it is getting comfortable in some formulas or things that work.  And like King, I never found a book bad, but really not quite the level when they are really on all the way.  Very often it falls in the last chapter who two.  Some of the recent books have showed some things coming around, and this one delivers.<br /><br />The Litigators has some of the familiar themes.  Small town lawyers trying to deal with various conflicts and demons that works and winds into big scenes and confrontations.<br /><br />But here it delivers like it has not recently.  I am glad I keep on reading his books and he has come around again with a well rounded book from start to finish.

1451662432|5.0|This book so far promises honesty in a solid 645 plus pages of his relationship with others. However, other critiques wish to crush memories that were not yet made on their own yet. In other biographies and publications this man has more than experiences that one can find fascinating as an immigrant or even as a native like myself. In other recordings both video and audio his preciseness can be marveled by the foremost industry that built lasting quality to human value. After attending his book opening he was able to pursue words through pain and joy of the making of this amazing book. I personally got to relate a lot to this book and identified inward to these solid experiences. Also identified outward as an observation to some of the deficiencies while being an axiom to truths that others lock up on. Who says man doesn't cry or get sick right? How does it feel right? This is definitely another universal story of a great man who maps out public service and great hero in my life today. This book sold me to another copy and look forward to pass it on to generations to come. This book has my stamp of approval.
B006GHA9QQ|2.0|Oh...dear.  Well, the book and lyrics and plot are way sub standard and different from the \\"Phantom\\". They make no sense, the characters would NEVER have followed this plotline. The music is much modernized, which is fine, but haradly any of original music or tunes, no \\"Opera either.  However, the sets, actors and costumes are great.  Expect no romance.

When I got it I was so excited because I have loved all their stuff up until I put Overexposed into my CD player. Not very good. Sounds like a late 70s reproduction of a train wreck. However, I put 3 stars because I liked a few songs on this CD. So in other words, wait till you see it at a discount store to buy it.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I loved this author's character development and her strong women protagonists.  Even more than the two voices she used to narrate this story, Lavinia and Belle, was the voice of Mama Mae, the central force in all of their lives.  Mama Mae was the primary caregiver to her family and the caretaker of the Big House.  She was the one who brought Lavinia out of her withdrawn state when the Captain purchased her from off the ship from Ireland.  Lavinia grew to adulthood in the warm embrace of the slaves who lived on his plantation.  The first time they all went to church together she couldn't understand why she wasn't allowed to sit with her family.  All of the white folks were ushered to the front of the church where Lavinia sat feeling isolated from those she loved.The ugliest characters in this book are all men....Marshall, the son of the plantation owner, his tutor, Mr. Waters who abused him and Rankin, the Plantation Manager.  Kathleen Grissom helps us understand the conditions of life on a plantation totally depended on the moral character of those who owned them and managed them.  Although the Captain was a benevolent man, his choice of Rankin as his manager was an abomination for all those who came into contact with him.  He was a drunk, a rapist, a thief, a murderer all rolled into one sorry SOB.  Every time Mrs. Grissom introduced him into the story line you knew trouble was soon to follow.  Marshall, was the victim of neglect by his Mother and Father, abuse by his Tutor, depravity by Rankin and grew to neglect and abuse others.  History repeated itself thruout this story.  On one hand you felt sorry for Marshall but then as he continued to make poor choices, you grew to despise him, like everyone else.  For me, that's what made this story unique; Mrs. Grissom had you identifying emotionally with all of her characters.  You can't sit on the sidelines watching from a distance as you are drawn into the heat of their struggles.

0307744434|4.0|Night Circus tells the story of two magician's apprentices who are pitted against one another, without consent, from an early age. The rules of the contest are unknown and neither knows who his or her opponent is. In time, as the apprentices become powerful in their own right, a Night Circus (exactly what it sounds like) is started to act as the venue of the challenge. Each challenger works alone, unable to directly interfere with the other's work.<br /><br />Night Circus is a super easy read that is well paced an appropriately deep for the length and difficulty level. The characters seem to be of the correct depth. While they could each be described in a few words, I never felt that they were flat. The wrap up has in interesting nod to the total lack of fate and predestination. I can't decide if I like that or if was more like the author shrugged her shoulders and just flipped the switch that ends the book.<br /><br />In generally, it's a really good book and I would recommend it as a nice, light read.

B005S9ELM6|5.0|It's not unusual for actors at some point to try their hand at directing. It is unusual though if they turn out to be good at it, and it's even more unusual when it turns out that they're consistently good at it. Argo is Ben Affleck's third turn at directing a feature film, and after 2007's Gone Baby Gone and 2010's The Town, I have to say that Affleck seems to really know what he's doing.<br /><br />Argo is a well-paced and tense rescue thriller drawn from a now largely forgotten episode of the 1980 Iranian Hostage Crisis. Everyone still remembers that shortly after the Iranian Revolution, 52 Americans were taken hostage when a mob of students and militants took over the US embassy in Tehran on November 4, 1979 and were held for 444 days, not being released until January 20th, 1981. What many have forgotten though is that six embassy staffers managed to slip out of the embassy before it was overrun and were able to take refuge at the home of the Canadian ambassador, where they ended up staying hidden for 85 days until an elaborate ruse by the CIA and the Canadian government allowed them to sneak out of the country even as the Iranian authorities were closing in on them. With a screenplay written by Chris Terrio based on a 2007 Wired article by Joshuah Bearman called \\"How the CIA Used a Fake Sci-Fi Flick to Rescue Americans from Tehran\\", Argo now tells that story.<br /><br />The film begins with the US embassy in Tehran surrounded by a mob of angry Iranians. When the mob begins crawling over the fence and entering the embassy compound, six Americans decide to slip outside of the embassy through a back entrance that wasn't on the main street where the mob had gathered. They end up taking refuge in the house of the Canadian ambassador, Ken Taylor (Victor Garber). When the US government learns of their situation, they start trying to figure out a way to get them out of the country before they're found. To this end, they bring in one of their \\"ex-filtration\\" specialists, Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck), who immediately shoots down the tentative plans they've come up with but doesn't have anything better to offer. At least not until, while talking to his young son on the phone, he tunes into a showing of Battle for the Planet of the Apes that his son is watching. The film gives him an idea: create a fake story about a sci-fi movie that supposedly will be shot in Iran by a Canadian production company, and then, using fake credentials, pass off the six Americans as a Canadian film crew for that movie, in Iran scouting locations, and then fly them out of the country once their scouting work is done. Even with the backing of his immediate boss, Jack O'Donnell (Bryan Cranston), the higher-ups at the CIA are dubious that the plan can work. But they give in when Mendez and O'Donnell point out that all of their plans are bad and that the fake film project \\"is the best bad plan we've got.\\"  The movie title - Argo - comes from the name of the screenplay Mendez eventually picks as the basis for their fake film project.  For as John Chambers (John Goodman) tells him once he undertakes the project, \\"Even a fake movie has to have a real screenplay behind it.\\"<br /><br />The cast are excellent. John Goodman does a nice turn as John Chambers, the affable Hollywood special-effects make-up artist Mendez turns to for help in creating the fake movie-buzz. Alan Arkin is perfectly cast as Lester Siegel, the veteran producer (a composite character) Mendez and Chambers recruit to help give the fake movie life, stealing every scene he's in with some of the best lines in the film (\\"If I'm going to make a fake movie, it's going to be a fake hit!\\")  Bryan Cranston's Jack O'Donnell is the kind of boss we all wish we had, going to the mat and breaking every rule of bureaucracy and protocol in highly creative ways when Mendez unexpectedly changes the plan at the last minute.  And Affleck himself is brilliant as Tony Mendez, showing a man who's methodical and committedand above all, superbly self-controlled under pressure, but without descending into a cliched action-hero. Affleck's Mendez feels the same strains and tensions everyone around him is feeling and experiences the same doubts - he just never lets it get the better of him. Or distract him from what needs to be done. And last but far from least, Scoot McNairy delivers a stand-out performance as hostage Joe Stafford, who goes from being the one most doubtful of and uncooperative with Mendez's plan to, in a critical moment, stepping up unexpectedly and playing his role as the crew's executive producer to the hilt, convincing the Revolutionary Guards at the airport not only that their film project is absolutely real, but that the story is about a revolt of downtrodden subjects, led by a wise man, who rise up to overthrow a tyrannical alien overlord, deftly turning the B-grade sci-fi plot into an allegory for the Iranian revolution.  What could easily have been a clich&eacute;d role, McNairy made into something that feels totally authentic, whether it's when he's expressing Stafford's fears and doubts in a plan that would sound dubious even to an optimist, or when he's playing a man improvising like hell in a critical moment, knowing that if he fails he and his friends could all be killed but channeling that fear into unrelenting determination to sell the idea with absolute committed sincerity.  A Best Supporting Actor nomination for McNairy would not surprise me in the least.<br /><br />Affleck as director does a terrific job of re-creating those tense days, particularly of the situation in Tehran itself where conditions border on anarchy and people are being summarily executed in the streets for anything from being suspected of pro-Shah loyalties to the simple settling of old scores. The tension is palpable from the beginning and Affleck deftly keeps turning it up, making you feel the very real sense of threat that the six Americans are feeling as the passing weeks of hiding in near constant fear take their toll on them. Importantly though, he also shows that it was ordinary Iranians themselves who suffered the most from the chaos and convulsions of the revolution. For all of the harshness of their months in captivity, all of the American hostages made it out alive. A lot of ordinary Iranians didn't.<br /><br />In addition, Affleck also shows enormous attention to detail, layering the film with inserted bits of period footage and music, filling in the background in which the hostage crisis took place:  the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, the 1980 Carter/Reagan Presidential contest, the boycotting by the US of the 1980 Olympics and so on.  And in recreated scenes, he used a special technique of shooting on regular film, then cutting half of the frames and blowing the remainder up by 200 percent to increase the graininess of the footage so simulate the feel of actual news footage of the period.<br /><br />As with any film based on historical events, there are certain differences between what you see in Argo and what actually happened.  Some were artistically necessary to keep the tension sustained all the way up to the point that the hostages actually left Iranian air space.  Others were made to keep the focus on the core characters and to make the plot narrative easier.  For example, the six hostages were actually hiding out in two Canadian residences and not one, but it was easier to write the screenplay with all of the hostage characters in one residence.  The only important difference that I feel should be pointed out is that the film downplays the role of the Canadians, both in terms of the actions of the Canadian diplomatic staff in Iran and in the extent to which the Canadian government was actively involved in the rescue planning.  The Canadian parliament actually had its first secret session since WWII to grant the six hostages real Canadian passports to make sure that their authenticity would pass any examination.  But all in all, Affleck does a commendable job of making a good edgy thriller without distorting the story beyond any real connection with actual events.<br /><br />On a side note, the real-life John Chambers was quite a fascinating individual. Few people will recognize the name but many have seen his handiwork. Best known for doing the special-effects make-up in the Planet of the Apes films (for which he won a special Academy Award), Chambers also was the man who came up with Spock's Vulcan ears in the original Star Trek TV series, and worked on TV shows from The Munsters and The Outer Limits to The Night Gallery and Lost In Space and numerous others. Chambers got his start in the Army during and after World War II, where as a medical technician he became involved in reconstructive surgery, creating new ears, noses, and chins, as well as teeth, for wounded veterans. He also got experience in creating prosthetic limbs. This background led to his getting a a job in makeup for NBC in 1953. In addition to his regular work, Chambers also used his expertise and contacts to help indigent cancer victims acquire prosthetics and reconstructive work they couldn't afford. For his work in films and television, he was awarded an Emmy and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. And for his behind-the-scenes work for the CIA over the years, he was awarded their highest civilian honor, which is mentioned in the epilogue at the end of the film where they show picture of the characters in the film alongside one of the real-life people they portrayed. A really remarkable man worthy of a bio-film of his own.<br /><br />Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys a well-crafted film with engaging performances that keeps the tension mounting and for anyone interested in an interesting bit of actual history.near constant fear take their toll on them.

For example, the six hostages were actually hiding out in two Canadian residences and not one, but it was easier to write the screenplay with all of the hostage characters in one residence.  The only important difference that I feel should be pointed out is that the film downplays the role of the Canadians, both in terms of the actions of the Canadian diplomatic staff in Iran and in the extent to which the Canadian government was actively involved in the rescue planning.  The Canadian parliament actually had its first secret session since WWII to grant the six hostages real Canadian passports to make sure that their authenticity would pass any examination.  But all in all,Affleck does a commendable job of making a good edgy thriller without distorting the story beyond any real connection with actual events.<br /><br />On a side note, the real-life John Chambers was quite a fascinating individual. Few people will recognize the name but many have seen his handiwork. Best known for doing the special-effects make-up in the Planet of the Apes films (for which he won a special Academy Award), Chambers also was the man who came up with Spock's Vulcan ears in the original Star Trek TV series, and worked on TV shows from The Munsters and The Outer Limits to The Night Gallery and Lost In Space and numerous others. Chambers got his start in the Army during and after World War II, where as a medical technician he became involved in reconstructive surgery, creating new ears, noses, and chins, as well as teeth, for wounded veterans. He also got experience in creating prosthetic limbs. This background led to his getting a a job in makeup for NBC in 1953. In addition to his regular work, Chambers also used his expertise and contacts to help indigent cancer victims acquire prosthetics and reconstructive work they couldn't afford. For his work in films and television, he was awarded an Emmy and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. And for his behind-the-scenes work for the CIA over the years, he was awarded their highest civilian honor, which is mentioned in the epilogue at the end of the film where they show picture of the characters in the film alongside one of the real-life people they portrayed. A really remarkable man worthy of a bio-film of his own.<br /><br />Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys a well-crafted film with engaging performances that keeps the tension mounting and for anyone interested in an interesting bit of actual history.
0062011847|3.0|Pratchett is delightful as always. This is another of the Sam Vimes as saviour of all things sapien books. In this instance he is introducing the world and the reader to the goblins of Discworld. There is an ample amount of typical Pratchett humor and the occasional play on word. Unfortunately this book is not Pratchett's best. His writing isn't as fluid as it once was. Some readers will love seeing all the old favorite characters again but I enjoy when he introduces a new cast.While Pratchett is always worth a read, if you're new to his work I would not start here.

0765356147|4.0|The Hero of Ages, the third installment of the Mistborn saga is a tome clocking in at 724 pages. At about the halfway point I started to feel the length of the book, from halfway to about 3/4 I was starting to wish for it to end. Finally, the last 10 - 25% it all became worth it for me.<br /><br />Sanderson exhibits many of the same flaws he did in The Final Empire. Both books deal with discoveries about the world in with the Mistborns live. In each case he uses a formula of foreshadowing the revelation, showing the setup, showing several examples of similar setups and how they relate to the foreshadow, then finally tying the foreshadow into the setup. In both cases there were a few too many examples. The foreshadow and setup were linked closely enough to make the pairing obvious.<br /><br />Where this book redeemed itself for me is in the conclusion. There are quite a few examples of mysteries throughout the book where we've been told the answer, then quietly misdirected away from it. When Sanderson does wrap it all up he does so in a very nice package that is in no way incongruous with the world. That's what  I love to see in epic fantasy.<br /><br />If you choose to read Hero of Ages, and I would encourage you to, know that it's some work and there is a lull but the pay-off is there.
B008QDCZJ2|5.0|Absolutely love the new album. I don't feel it is as bouncy and dancy as their earlier work. Instead it is more mature, warmer and just beautiful. Every time I listen to it, a different song stands out and grabs my attention.
0765356139|4.0|the second installment of the Mistborn series is a worthy successor to The Final Empire. It's pretty lengthy at 763 pages and I'm glad I didn't jump into it immediately after finishing The Final Empire. It opens a year after the end of the first book and sets itself up as obviously the second in a trilogy. We are now dealing with heroes of action and daring-do attempting to play rulers and politicians, dealing with the realization that some of the evils they so despised had very good reasons for existing. They are also dealing with trying to grow up from the childish petulence of rebels to stable rules. Finally, they are dealing with a very literal change in culture as they attempt to deal with Elend Venture's unorthodoxed style of leadership, democracy.<br /><br />The book lags a bit in the middle as it dwells too long on the uncertainties of Vin and Elend's relationship and each of their uncertainties regarding their roles in the largeer scheme of things. That is a huge theme in this book for all characters. Where book one was about bravery and friendship, book two is about insecurity and maturation. There is a point where the whol book shifts though and action returns. The finale of the book is an excellent call back to the action of book one. I don't know how Sanderson does it but he manages to ratchet up the intensity without letting it get away from him. His characters were already super human in the first book. In book two they do things they even they acknowledge as beyond their own comprehension yet it all seems plausible in the framework setup.<br /><br />This book is defintely worth the read.
B007UPNA6Y|5.0|I have read all the Jack Reacher series and they keep getting better and better. Can't wait for the next one as it won't be that long now before I finish \\"A Wanted Man\\".
0553386794|3.0|Read this book after all the hype with the TV show. The only word I keep coming up with to describe it is that is is \\"fine\\". It didn't leave me excited and itching for more but it succeeded in not feeling like a chore. Most of the characters are pretty one dimensional and Martin tries to play with this lack of nuance within the characters but given their simplicity it becomes pretty predictable.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Much better than the first book. Can not wait until the third one comes. I think Crossfire Novel series have a better story line than Fifty Shades. When you compare the two women from each series.
0439023521|3.0|I came into my eventual reading of The Hunger Games skeptically. I'm not usually a fan of best sellers and I'm yet to meet a franchise that Hollywood loved for which I share the sentiments.<br /><br />As I began reading the story of Katniss who lives in a poor district, breaking the law to keep her family fed, I found myself more compelled than I expected. She was drawn into the Hunger Games and I still found myself interested as she attempted to navigate her new life situation, in the lead up to the games. It was once the game got rolling in earnest that I found myself becoming dissatisfied with the book.<br /><br />Two things happened to make the book not work for me. First, the book is an action adventure story. When the characters aren't doing something the entire thing stagnates. Exploring the characters' thought and motivations in the moment are not Collins's strengths. Second, she begins to build in too many out for our main character. For a person fighting to survive in the Hunger Games there are too many taken opportunities to not deal with other characters and just let the world around her do it. I wish I could give specifics but they're all very spoilery.The good news is that this is a book that can be read in one sitting. The bad news is that about 2/3 of the way into that sitting you may find yourself no longer interested in what you're doing.<br /><br />This is a very \\"take it or leave it\\" book for me.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I love this game....got me through several months of my recent pregnancy!! the graphics are great and I love the twist on the classic concept of gameplay. :)
0812550757|4.0|I read Ender's Game not that long ago and found it to be good but not great. Speaker for the Dead is that great book. Speaker picks up with Andrew Wiggins thousands of years later under a new guise.<br /><br />Andrew Wiggins the first Speaker for the Dead is a believable version of young Ender who has spent years learning about the species he destroyed. Now he has an opportunity to learn about an alien species before he has destroyed it. First he has to learn about the most alien species, humans.<br /><br />The book tells a message we all need to understand. It talks a lot about love, platonic in nature. Love for fellow man and, in the event of discovery, for alien brothers too. It also talks a lot about truth and how a lack of it impedes love. There is some minor tension with the church but Card never lets it overwhelm the book or become to tropy.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone. I have one very minor gripe and it's with the specifc edition I read. I tend to read the author's notes in the front of books before I read the story. There is a plot point in the book regarding the ritual death of piggies that is important in the pace of the book, it's spoiled in the author's note. so if you get \\"the author's definitive edition\\" don't read the author's note.
B005LAIHSQ|5.0|I wanted to see it at the movies and missed out. So I have been waiting for it to be released on DVD and was not disappointed. I loved it!!!
0765322889|4.0|I was truly enamoured with the world building of this book. The entire first act had me wishing only that I could read more, faster. The second act drug on a bit but was overall very enjoyable. It allowed the author to move from world building to plot setting and driving. He had the same issue I've seen in several books recently where the second act drags on a little too much as he manuevers all the players into position for Act 3. He came dangerously close to committing the mortal sin of shoehorning every character into the final scene of act 3. The final act had a wonderful moment where it seemed that perhaps all this work had gone into manuevering players for naught, I would have loved to see him play on that further.All in all it was a really good book and I look forward to reading more of his work. Erikson has a slightly strange writing style that caused me to reread sentances more often than I prefer, I feel like he doesn't always identify to subject or bounces from subject to subject and isn't always clear. The world is fantastic, the action is strong if a bit forced at times. The themes were strong throughout the book although toward the end he gets a little hamfisted in holding up the theme as if worried the reader might miss it.
B0040ZA2FE|4.0|a master piece for this folk band.<br /><br />So good for a country ride,<br />have a nice trip<br /><br />north american gringo's
0374275637|4.0|This book was a terrific read! The experience of reading it was very challengin at times. It is written in dry prose, like a text book and very occasionally lingers too long on a piint. That was all offset by the many moments while I read the book and thought \\"This is amazing\\". Kahneman slowly and deliberately builds a case that we are of two minds. To build his case he uses example questions that almost always hit their mark. Even when they don't quite hit he is able to extract the point he wamted.<br /><br />Reading this book is a commitment but if you want to understand how you misremembet, misbelive and misunderstand the world around you, this is a commitment worth making.<br /><br />ADDENDUM: I read this book a few months ago and in the interim I have found my mind going back to this over and over. I really recommend this book.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|All together good read. Can't wait for the next book. I would recommend this book to my friends. It is as good as fifty shades of grey.
0451450523|3.0|A good book but probably not the book for me. The Last Unicorn is a book of three minds, at times it is a fairy tale, fantastic and enigmatic, at times it is a satire, winking and nodding at the audience and digging its elbow in your side, finally it is simply a fantasy story about loss and the gains that can come from it.<br /><br />I think it was well written but the writing got lost in the moments where it become a little too lost in its own fairy dust. It suffers from the same problem a lot of Lovecraft suffers from, how do you describe something that is literally indescribable. By definition, any attempt will be feeble and fail. Beagle fairs better in his efforts than Lovecraft does, in my opinion, but it's a bit of an impossible task, he has created a mountain so great that even he can not scale it.<br /><br />The bits of satire suited me well. It danced dangerously close to the edge of going too far but never quite got there. I do wish there had been a hair more of that but it's possible that more would have been too much.<br /><br />The actual story arc was fairly satisfying. I found myself actually feeling sad at time when it was appropriate although I never found myself as angry as I felt was desired by characters and author.<br /><br />In the end I'm giving it 3 of five stars,  I do think this is a great book for a younger person to read, one more taken with the fairy style of fantasy. For anyone he enjoys fantasy style this probably still is a \\"should read\\".
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is crazy FUN! it is addictive. once you play you will play for a good while. definitely s must-try.
0307389839|5.0|Murakami's book is great for anyone who has ever done anything with the long view. In the context of the book he's talking about marathon running and writing but the message will resonate with anyone else who knows what it's like to grind out an activity over years, whether it's hobby or profession.<br /><br />The book is very light and readable. I recommend it to anyone.
B0072440OE|5.0|It has been some time since I have really fluffed a new album. If I were to be asked what was my favorite all time album, it would be Bob Dylan's Blood on the Tracks. I got turned onto it in high school and it never left my heart. I would compare this album, Norah Jones' \\"Broken little hearts\\" to \\"Blood on the Tracks\\" or Peter Gabriel's \\"Us\\". Each of these three artists/albums seemed to be written when the artists heart was ripped apart from a serious (or in Peter Gabriel's case two) relationship. Each seem to have had the ability to take that dark pain and express it as art that lets you see their pain. They have taken their pain and made something beautiful from it. With Norah Jones, this really was my first taste of her music. The way I got turned on to her was by listening to the jazz station on spotify. They played some Melody Gardot, which I pursued and fell in love with. While checking out amazon, they pointed me to \\"similar\\" or \\"those who like this also like this\\" Norah's album and Diana Krall, who I have yet to explore.<br /><br />Norah's voice is just beautiful. Her voice does not, imho, show her feelings. The feelings come from the words themselves. And the lack of feeling in her voice makes it a haunting album. It is like you see her pain, but you do not hear it. I don't really know here story, what it was that brought her to this place, but I'm sure I'll read about it sooner or later.<br /><br />On to the album. It starts off with \\"Good Morning\\" which sets the mood with the very first lines of the song \\"Good morning, my thoughts on leaving are back on the table, I thought you should know. I'm folding my hand.\\" Next \\"Say Goodbye\\" with words like \\"It ain't easy to stay in love when you're telling lies, So I'll just have to take a bow and say goodbye.\\" \\"Take it Back\\" delivers \\"Words spoken silently, I could never understand, how breath delivers such poison, To someone too weak to stand.\\" \\"Four Broken Hearts\\" - \\"So you try to replace me, but you didn't getfar. And I try to repay you, but I only got scarred. I tried to erase you. But didn't get far...Enough away from you Because you still can break my heart\\" But the Marquee song for me is \\"Miriam\\" which I have written out below.<br /><br />\\"Miriam<br />That's such a pretty name<br />I'm gonna say it when I make you cry<br />Miriam<br />You know you done me wrong<br />I'm gonna smile when you say goodbye<br />Now I'm not the jealous type<br />Never been the killing kind<br />But you know I know what you did<br />So don't put up a fight<br />Miriam<br />When you were having fun<br />In my big pretty house<br />Did you think twice?<br />Miriam<br />Was it a game to you?<br />Was it a game to him?<br />Don't tell me lies<br />I know he said it's not your fault<br />But I don't believe that's true<br />I've punished him from ear to ear<br />Now I've saved the best for you<br />And I try not to hurt you<br />'Cause you might not be that bad<br />But it takes a lot to make me go this mad<br />Oh, Miriam<br />That's such a pretty name<br />And I'll keep saying it<br />Until you die<br />Miriam<br />You know you done me wrong<br />I'm gonna smile when you say goodbye<br />You know you done me wrong<br />I'm gonna smile when<br />I take you life<br />Mmmm...\\"<br /><br />The album ends with \\"All a dream\\" where she momentarily questions the reality of her situation and wishing it was a nightmare, but realizing its just a dream and her nightmare is her reality.<br /><br />It is a double album pressed on white vinyl, with red labels. In my opinion, the album is not for everybody, but if you can appreciate someone just laying their broken heart out in words and song, this one is deep. Every song on the album relates to her failed relationship. I don't really know if I want to read her story of what brought her to this place, or let it be a mystery. Now, I'm dying to see her perform it though.
0765350386|5.0|This is probably the best fantasy book I've read to date. I truly enjoyed the world Sanderson has created. It's not overly complicated but has enough mysteries to explore to keep me engaged. I felt the characters were very well crafted, they all have strengths and weaknesses and have moments were either plays to their benefit and frustration. The book has great sequences of dialog and planning broken by very entertaining action that are cinematic without feeling like they were meant simply as a reason to sell the film rights.<br /><br />I have two, and only two very small complaints. First, there should be one more editing pass. There were a few incorrect words and spots where trhe grammar was poor. Second, I felt the characters were a little dimmer than was fair regarding the final revalations of the book. I felt that they were adequately explained about 2/3 of the way through. Although I never got the sense that I was waiting for the action to catch up with the plat development, an experience I've had with many other novels.<br /><br />As mentioned before, this is probably the best fantasy I've read to date. I enjoyed it so much it drove me to seek out other fantasy, hoping that lightning will strike twice. Of course, I will be reading the full series.
B000007638|5.0|This is a must-have cd! I usually don't like \\"recorded live\\" music because of all the background noise. This one has the quality of a studio release, but you still feel like you're there at the concert. Paul McCartney's voice is amazing and I enjoyed each and every song. This one is a great gift for anyone who loves Paul McCartney and Wings. And an even better gift for the person who got to see them in concert.
0156030306|5.0|Flowers for Algernon is probably the best book I've ever read. It's amazingly depressing, occasionally leaving me with a lump in my throat as I read it but that speaks to the skill of the author and power of the books. At a300 pages it's got an amazing economy of words to have such an impact. It manages to sweep through concepts of religion, intelligence, academia, treatment of the handicapped and the definition of a man in those few pages.<br /><br />This book is too depressing to read often but I think it warrants a read by everyone, if not several of the course of time.
B0064O927I|4.0|good watch fast delivery very light dont even know its on your rist well maybe but its light touch screen can take a little to get the hang of
0307887448|4.0|I shouldn't like this book but I do. Deus Ex Machina is rampant, the main character contradicts himself in different parts of the book and the outcome is predicatable from very early on. Yet, I found myself racing back to read the book. Maybe it was the pop culture references or the puzzle nature of the book but I found it delightful. I hope Cline's writing improves because if he can keep finding that X factor for me, I'll want to read his future works.
B000TGZQXG|5.0|This is a very good effort from the '90s Megadeth that went \\"commercial\\".  But this is by no means a bad effort, quite the contrary, the riffs are as heavy as ever, if a bit slow.  The guitar and bass work is stellar, and Dave's voice is its usual self.<br /><br />If you are a fan of hard/heavy metal, without devolving in a scream fest going at 300 bpm, this is a nice album to have.

B001NHNG64|1.0|Terrible entry in the series.  I read Persuader first- really liked it. Then I started with book 1; Thought Killing Floor pushed the limits of all plausibility, but this cartoonish cringe-fest really upped the ante.  The villains are so laughable it was impossible to take any part of this silly plot seriously.  It was truly amazing to me that they continued to keep Reacher alive no matter how much trouble he caused them (although there was always 5 or 6 rifles leveled at him, aimed at his head).  \\"How did you disable the shortwave radio?\\" Really? How about put a bullet in his head and figure it out yourself????

B008673ZAQ|5.0|I can't agree with more with all the rave reivews of this book! I love Eva and Gideon and can't wait until the next book. I have to say I was reading soo quickly and I was so involved with the story line that when it ended i was SHOCKED! I was like, \\"NO that can't be the end!\\"<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, it ended well but I was just so entralled with Eva and Gideon and what was happening I wasn't aware that I was about to lose them until book three comes out! I wish it was out already and I've already added it too my wish list.<br /><br />I have to say the first book was very similar to Fifty but not this book. They are soo different and both so troubled but they fight for each other and what they have. As hard as it is they love each other and it's a beautiful thing to read. I LOVED IT!

0765356147|5.0|I'll avoid spoilers, but suffice it to say that Brandon Sanderson is quite a talented writer, and his way of blending together minor details creates a world that feels both deep and vibrant. Just about every loose end that is relevant is wrapped up, and our heroes get a heroic ending that is not the rushed affair most writers trend towards. The entire trilogy moves toward the last few chapters of this book, and it is certainly a page turner I would happily recommend.

B008XBCJ34|5.0|To make a long story short, I never watched this is 3d, ever. Always wanted to buy it, didn't want to pay 150 on fleebay. I watched the original version with all of the little kids a kadrillion and a half times while babysitting. So believe me when I say it got repetitive.<br /><br />I wasn't expecting anything overwhelmingly spectacular (as was the case with every 3d movie that I currently own). Let me tell you this: this completely exceeded my expectations. This is what a 3d movie was meant to be. Each scene is well optimized and it looks as though  the movie's color was adjusted to compensate for the 3d glasses' darkness.<br /><br />Thank you James Cameron. My hope in humanity is slightly restored.
B0086449YA|5.0|I have been a Direstraits/Mark Knopfler fan since the late 1980s', he is one of the greatest artists for me. I grew up listening to his music, and own all the releases. In the recent past, my favourites were Sailing to Philadelpia and Shangrila, which were true classics. Mark had become predictable in his last few releases, so I was not expecting a new approach when I read about his latest album, but I was wrong. Privateering is a brilliant album, bluesy, and the quality of the recording is exceptional. I own high-end speakers (MG12's, B&W) and it is a pleasure to hear this album. RedBud tree, Privateering, Kingdom of Gold, Submariner, Go Love, and Yon two crows are stand-out tracks. I just hope Mark has not peaked in his career, and he continues to produce such high quality music like this album for years to come. My vote for the Album of the year.

B004GCPJDQ|2.0|It doesn't appear that anyone who designed this product attempted to install it, or watch a novice install it - as the design of the battery compartment cover simply does not fit the magic mouse. Getting it on basically required destruction of the button on the bottom of the mouse. Terrible design.<br /><br />Oh, and it didn't work. I charged the battery completely removed from the mouse, charged it while in the mouse, etc. The charging station had a solid green light indicating full charge. In no circumstance would the mouse turn on. I jiggled the battery thinking the contacts weren't touching fully, but to no avail.<br /><br />Bad enough to make me write my first review ever on Amazon.<br /><br />It gets two stars rather than 1 because it came in a pretty box.

B00910Y1OQ|4.0|this game is good and addictive a really good time killer a mist have for those long waits at the Dr office or any time lol
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Nothing amazing or groundbreaking, but an entertaining bejeweled-type game. Probably better suited for kids because of the silly storyline, but kept me busy on my flight.
B00846REIS|5.0|Bared to you is a very enticing sexual & dark novel. Crossfire is an amazing series that you'll finish the day you pick them up. They are very similar to the Fifty Shades series, but a lot darker & the characters aren't so innocent. It's very sultry & of course you fantisize the entire time.  I can't wait for the next installment.
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|I am so impressed with this film. From the first chords of the majestic soundtrack and the sublime images of landscape it put me in awe. I am impressed with the story, the cinematography, the characters, the costume design, the sets, the spaceship designs, the alien designs, the CGI, and on and on. It seems like Ridley Scott successfully homaged his own ALIEN movie and at the same time successfully homaged 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY. The first scenes of the robot/android prowling the ship and the crew waking up feels like a perfect blending of the 2 movies; no small feat. Noomi Rapace is my favorite actor from her role as Lisbeth, and here she plays Elizabeth, and it felt like the movie is her vehicle, she is the ultimate survivor, and her quest could easily become another trilogy. I will mention a few things that I liked, but that could have been even better ( I'm not complaining ): The main CREATOR aliens could have been less musclebound, and could have had female counterparts... I suspect there is more to this story. I liked the tentacled aliens, and they look and move superbly, and I liked that there were 3 or 4 different types in different stages, but it is a bit confusing and not completely coherent, but if this were reality we would not know what was going on anyway so it's ok, the 3 part storyline is not apparent at first viewing, so we are left wondering what does this mean and where are we now, but I caught on quickly enough. I am a little tired of tentacled aliens, but these are done so well and the action is so realistic and so interesting that I love it. the story basically is that a rich guy goes in search of the CREATORS, who look like musclebound albinos. The rich guy and his crew find them on another planet, they investigate, they all become infected with various aliens, Noomi survives, and with the robot she goes on in search of the CREATORS home world. Of course, it is all much more complicated than that. It is also superiorly beautiful. There are fantastic and beautiful special effects, all tasteful and very creative. The characters are good and beautiful to look at. I think there is even an homage to Lisbeth Salander in the movie. And even the character of Elizabeth seems like a continuation of Lisbeth's life, and I am very satisfied with it all. The ship interiors are gorgeous, in fact, so much of this film is gorgeous that I am still impressed. The story, after much thought, is pretty darned good and holds up. It can cause much debate about human life, etc. which is the point of good film anyway. See it.astic and beautiful special effects, all tasteful and very creative.

0345803507|2.0|Of all the trilogy, I liked this one the least.<br /><br />Now that Ana and Christian are married, life should be great.  Except '50' still has issues and there 's his ex-girlfriends to deal with (doms, whatever) and Jack, who is a clearly deranged stalker.  Yes, that's a lot for any newlyweds' plates but........<br /><br />It felt as if Christian Grey was being neutered in the book.  It was his brokenness that made him so tragic and alluring.  The attempt to 'fix' him felt so wrong for me, and confusing.  Honestly, even Christian himself seemed confused by his ending.  I hated the plot twist!  It just seemed so out of character for both characters.  The characters also felt different this time around and the plot felt forced, almost as if the author were arranging things just so before she left for a long trip.<br /><br />I wish I hadn't read this one.  I just needed the '50' fix and was hopeful such a tragic character would get the story he deserved.  Alas, he did not.  If you are solely reading this for the eroticism, fear not.  It is in full force.  The author doesn't push any more boundaries here either, which I had come to expect.  In all, a disappointing finish to the whole story.
B0094GW6YE|4.0|After hearing \\"Hell or Halleuljah\\" and thinking ive heard \\"I Stole Your Love\\" already i said im not even buying this album. Then hearing \\"Long Way Down\\" gave me some hope then the \\"Mr. Speed\\" sounding \\"All for the love of Rock n Roll\\" had me back where i began. But as a long time fan i gave in and glad i did. Sure they go into their past and revisit a few riffs. Overall after a few listens it is a good body of work. Leaving the song \\"Last Chance\\" off the album would of made it better. I dont complain about no original memebers because it probally wouldnt sound as good with them and there wouldnt even be a album if they were in the band. This album has grown on me more everyday. Now the vinyl on the other hand sounds like crap. very muddy and distorted to the point it ruins the listening experience. Their self released \\"Sonic Boom\\" lp atleast had a poster and lyric sleeve in it, Monster gives you and plain white sleeve with a awful sounding peice of vinyl in it. But im just rating on the songs alone. Even the ones that i heard before the release and hated grew on me. This is not their best, but the best in my opinion since Revenge.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Great. lots of,surprises, plenty of action. Reacher stumbles into another adventure, but doesnt lose sight of his goal.<br />  would like more.romance but otherwise great.<br /><br /> v
B008XG1X18|5.0|No matter what your interests are, there is something in this app for everyone. I personally get in trouble in the DIY &amp; Crafts section.
B007FG9LIE|3.0|I felt for most of this novel that it was just another retelling of the old isolated, good on the outside, evil underneath cult tale. But I'll give the author credit for putting an interesting original twist at the end. The story moves along fairly well and kept my interest. Other than the protagonist, character development is weak and some of the metaphors are lame. Could defintely have a sequel with better developed characters. Worth the price I paid.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Really excellent book. I couldn't stop reading it. I am ready for the next one, too bad I have to wait until next year. Although, I am quite sure it will be well worth the wait.
B003L77GG0|5.0|This DVD collection of Smallville wraps up a ten year run of this popular series.  Loose ends throughout the series have been wrapped up and concluded.
B008PZ69T8|5.0|I bought this item with reservation after reading the reviews for the book.  I do like a large variety of music, including classical.  However, I have never heard anything so beautiful in my life.  Some of the music sounds like the music they must play in heaven.  Unbelievable!!!<br /><br />I play it all the time, put it on my Ipod, and computer at work.<br /><br />Love, love, love it!!
B00122IYJY|5.0|In my opinion this is the best hard rock album of all time. Eddie Van Halens guitar work and David Lee Roths vocals are still relevant to today.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|it is fun becuas it is math for children. so if you have a mom or dad tell that it id fun.
B008OJ291W|2.0|Okay...Here's how the music biz works..<br />Cadillac, or their ad agency calls up the record label and songwriters and wants to use a bit of a song in a national commercial (Led Zeppelin \\"Rock n Roll\\").... the label that owns the master recording (Atlantic) gets a piece and the songwriters/music publishers gets a bigger taste. What many stars are doing is recording their old hits ...and not with the intent of improving them or finding something new but to have control of both the masters AND the publishing ...so that they are free to offer these to ad agency baby boomers and keep all the money.  Foreigner recently re-created their greatest hits without lead singer Lou Gramm and now Jeff Lynne is doing the same.  Paul Rodgers has done this with Free and Bad Company songs but he has the good sense and class to keep those recordings for commercial purposes and not to foist them on the public with some \\"story\\" about finding something new to say or other gibberish... these are attempts to recreate the originals and control their destiny.<br /><br />I don't fault Mr Lynne for what he's doing but he should not release them and not release them as ELO ....<br />If somebody can't find the multiple offerings of the true ELO and their Greatest Hits [[ASIN:B0009YNSJW All Over the World: The Very Best of Electric Light Orchestra [ORIGINAL RECORDING REMASTERED]]][[ASIN:B005JJ0GL0 The Essential Electric Light Orchestra]] among the many...then I guess this would be an okay collection ...but other than that one would have to be a \\"completist\\" to bother with this.  I am a fan and the lure of something different from one of my favorites as well as a bonus track \\"Point Of No Return\\" got me to bite. Sadly the best thing I can say about any of the tracks is that they almost sound as good as the originals. Mr Blue Sky is actually truncated and he does not copy his original ending...which was a favorite of mine!  Do Ya features Mr Lynne pretty much ignoring the replication of the very cool drum solo of the original... this is a curiosity for me not something I enjoy as much as the originals and in no way do I hear it as an improvement.<br /><br />NEWS FLASH.... you can google this for more but Def Leppard is claiming they don't like the way Universal Music is treating them so they are in the process of recording identical copies of their hits to market online and to license. This is due to the classic rock revolution happening in advertising....something that Rockers like Neil Young said they would never participate in but most others are happy to enjoy the profits from and as Led Zeppelin and Cadillac found out can be amazingly effective in helping a \\"brand\\" get a retro hip status!<br />Its one thing if as Jeff Lynne says ...he can make the old songs sound so much better , but frankly they don't ..they sound amazingly  similar...which is the real point folks.<br /><br />NOW on the other hand Mr Lynnes latest [[ASIN:B008Y5OW20 Long Wave]] is HIGHLY recommended and I love it!

1439156816|5.0|I read this years ago while discovering my writing style and voice. I still think about King's advice and candid wisdom.  Same as his writing style, he cuts clear to the jugular. In today's world, where anyone can write a book, King sets the bar and we should all strive to reach it. If you have any writing aspirations, read his book.
B0063IH60K|5.0|It is a great way to unwind at the end of a stressful day. I would happily recommend playing this version.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|It is a fun jeweled game with extra challenges. I just wish you didn't have to have timer or lives.
B008O9V4C2|5.0|I don't have much to add to the previous 5 star reviews. Just wanted to put my 2 cents in and say that Sunken Condos is everything I'd hoped it would be and then some.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I\\"ve read the other books and this one rates as one of the best.  Since I have it on kindle I take it with me and if I have a few minutes I read.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Loved this book. Thought that after reading the 50 Shades trilogy I wouldn't be able to find another fix. This was definitely a good fix. Can't wait for the third in December.
B007CGLRWA|5.0|This was a fantastic movie! Adrien Brody's performance in this movie was better than it was in The Pianist. This movie is a great pick, for any view that loves a good drama.
B007HJ84ZK|5.0|I have waited forever for Season 2. This is a great show, but Amazon hasn't even given a date for when the 2nd season will become available and it's getting on my nerves....
B005POK858|5.0|I have been playing classic RPG's for years, Laxius series, Aveyond series etc, and this is right up there.  The game play is smooth, the story advances well and the graphics, IMO, are awesome.  Will definitely buy/play more from this company.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This was soo much better than Bared to You!  Glad I stuck with it and can not wait to find out what happens to Ava, Gideon and Cary in the next book. Intense, hot scenes....loved 'em!!
B006T3RM08|2.0|I ordered this product while the MeshWe was unavailable.<br /><br />My trackpad does not work properly with this product.  It ends up not clicking properly and sometimes tracking ceases to function as well.  I end up pulling it out and putting it back in over and over.  Eventually I just take it out and use it beside the Clique on my desk, my trackpad works just fine when I do that.  I'm handy enough to fix my Clique by cutting away the part the covers the trackpad but I wish this product worked out of the package.  Perhaps if the company manufactured to a higher tolerance standard this wouldn't happen.  I doubt the original designed and tested product could have been released with this issue so maybe some quality control would fix this.<br /><br />The MeshWe design is open on top and I've never had an issue with it.  I like the look of the Clique more but since it doesn't work I'm going to end up butchering it anyway.<br /><br />I bought my Clique relying on assurances from other reviewers that this was a past issue that the company had corrected.  Buy the MeshWe, don't risk buying the Clique.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I am pleasently surprised with this game. Honestly, I would not have thought this game was really challenging and fun. I definitely suggest giving it a try. You just may be surprised.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|The Avengers was ok. There were parts I thought were really stupid, though. You rarely see the Hulk, who is now played by Mark Ruffalo in human-form, and who goes after everyone when enraged. He tries to kill Iron Man, for example. It had awesome special effects, but everything else was a little shaky.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|This book has been a game changer the first two weeks are hard but this has fundamentally changed the way I look at exercise after photos coming in dec
B008N1LL42|5.0|Outstanding, best use of the wounded warers and other vets we have seen. I hope that they find a way to make a secquel to this super movie.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I have to say that this book was not as good as the first, which is often the case with sequels. Despite that, it was still a good read. The ending has me especially curious and wanting to start the third right away. I would recommend.
0316228532|4.0|I have so many thoughts about this book and must preface with a little bit about my own personal beliefs. I am a very political person (I am very active in county and state-wide politics). I would identify as a liberal. All that being said, I found The Casual Vacancy to be a well-written social commentary.<br /><br />I believe it is the duty of society to help everyone. That all people deserve an equal chance to live a successful life and that the government has a hand in making that happen.<br /><br />Right now in the United States, the concept of how and if we should help those who are struggling is being hotly contested in the Presidential election. Do we want to be a society where the luckiest of us succeed, oftentimes because of luck or numerous intangible benefits, and the rest are left to languish or one that aims to raise the level of all people? It is a question that J.K. Rowling so deftly handles here.<br /><br />Pagford, the town so beautifully created by J.K. Rowling is having this same kind of identity crisis. Many years in the past, a portion of land once owned by a famous family in town is sold and public housing is built. Those living in the housing have access to the good schools of Pagford. There are those on the council who wish for the estates to become the problem of the next largest city of Yarvil. They feel that The Fields is a blight on their perfect town.<br /><br />The Casual Vacancy has a slow start. It revolves around an entire town and is full of characters. The change of voice from one character to the next was somewhat confusing until I really started to get a feel for who each character was. Around the 300 page mark, The Casual Vacancy really picks up steam. We start to see how interconnected this community is and how they can and do impact each others lives. It is not only a story of social responsibility, that we owe to our neighbors to make sure that those with less are treated with dignity but also that the attention that we pay can save lives.<br /><br />The most tragic storyline of the Weedons is handled so well. We can see why Terri, who is abused nearly from birth, is barely able to function even if she seems to want to change. Why we get a cycle of abuse when her own negligence leads to her daughter acting out and eventually getting raped. It bucks the stereotype of the lazy person with their hand out waiting for their government check to read the story of what went so wrong in one family.<br /><br />The ending is really brilliant and so tragic. It is like a dance in which each character misses their turn, and one small, seemingly insignificant action has huge ramifications on the lives of the most vulnerable.<br /><br />The Casual Vacancy by J.K. Rowling is a social commentary where you are forced to imagine the lives of those around you. They can be raw and cruel but the authenticity is really gripping.
B008RYN44U|3.0|I wasn't planning on writing a review until I noticed a trend among the other reviews posted here. This common trend saying that this is a \\"Gwen\\" album. Anyone who has listened to her two solo albums would hear that this is NOT Gwen....however this isn't really No Doubt either.<br /><br />It's as if Gwen and No Doubt reunited and...tamed each other down. There are too many slow boring songs on this album to be anywhere near Gwen's solo albums but these slow songs lack any...oomph from previous No Doubt efforts.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this album really only has two hits \\"Settle Down\\" and \\"Push and Shove\\" the rest just aren't anything special. I Hope this isn't No Doubt's last album...maybe we'll see another release from them in another 10 years lol.
034580404X|5.0|I received the books in a timely matter the ONLY problem was that I couldn't track the package once the \\"shipper\\" shipped the books. So im assuming that would be the companies fault. OVER ALL IT WAS A GREAT BUY :)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game has lots of fun and tricky games u have 2 try and get all of the games done. BEST GAME EVER
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love love love pinterest!  highly recommend this app!  once you get on and start looking at all the pins the hours will just fly by!  there are so many amazing ideas!
0694003611|5.0|An effective children's book to put your child to sleep. I used this book to help my daughter go to sleep. She responded well.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Awesome book, as usual from Rick Riordan. Suspense and whatnot the whole way through, with a lot of twists! And then the promised cliffhanger... Five stars all the way. I would've said more, but spoilers are mean!
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I found this book entertaining.  It wasn't the best written book, but that isn't the point of this type of literature.  Overall, I would recommend and read again.
1407471163|4.0|This is a book that is meant to be read the old fashioned way.  While the narator read beautifully it was impossible to figure out who was speaking and when. Since I was not aware of quotation marks or italicized words, I was lost at times.<br /><br />My book club dicussed the book last night and we all agreed it was a very good book although most of us felt the ending was too abrupt.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|What a perfect application. always works and has never let me down. I don't even have anything bad to say about it
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app &amp; helps organize pins easily!!! Sometimes it does force close but still great app! It is worth using.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|I saw Lee Child on a morning show and found him so engaging that I had to read one of his book.  Starting with the first Jack Reacher seemed like a good idea. BTW, Child said that his wife game him the name because Child was asked in a grocery store to get something for a 'high-challenged' woman, so Child's wife called him a 'reacher'.  Cute and original.<br /><br />I find that when I like the author, I know I'll like the book, so I dove into The Killing Floor.  As a thriller, Killing Floor had all the elements you'd expect from this type of book.  An excellent back-story, an intriguing and complex hero, and a story where the reader learns a great deal about a subject you could go your whole life with out knowing.<br /><br />What I found slightly flawed about the book, which made me give it only 4 stars, was the length of the book.  It's not that I don't like lengthy books, The Stand, and Pillars of the Earth are a couple of favorites of mine, it's just that this book was too long for both the story and the type of book it is.  I'd be interested to know if Child's subsequent books are less wordy.  But--as a first book, this is a great debut for an author.<br /><br />Jack Reacher, the hero of the story, has quit the army and now enjoys his freedom by moving around from town to town.  He gets off a Greyhound bus in a small Georgia town because his brother told him that it's where a blind guitar player was last seen.  Turns out Reacher's older, and only brother was also last seen in this town, and when Reacher is thrown in jail for a night, he decides to stick around and see what the problem is.<br /><br />Some of the things in the book were a bit dated, since it was written 6 years ago, but this didn't detract from the overall enjoyment of the book.  I'm glad I read it, and I know have another 'go-to' book for long flights if I ever need one.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Masterpiece Theatre production of \\"Downton Abbey\\" continues its excellence.  The cast is quite formidable, especially the great Maggie Smith.<br />She is one of England's treasures.  Even though they are the upper class you care about the members of the household upstairs and downstairs.<br />The only negative I have is that one of the discs was warped and the pixels kept breaking up. All of the other discs were in perfect condition.
B009329ZF2|4.0|Not the best Sci-Fi movie regarding our US forces vs. aliens plot wise, but entertaining nevertheless. Battle targeting sequences based on the classic Battleship game were amusing to see. I only wish more footage of the inside and outside of the Missouri could have been included.  The Navy has required that all of her original equipment remain in place and not modified while serving as a floating museum, movie prop, or other use.  They just don't commission ships like this any more, and never will!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I found the 4 first chapters too ... and i really mean too similar to twilight (i love twilight!!every word) clumsy girl, divorced parents, location, the guy is wealthy (really wealthy), makes generous gifts, they fall for each other the moment he holds her up from falling, christians hair...an so on and on AND YET i was \\"beguiled\\" by it. i think that a book turns into a bestseller because it reaches people from different levels not only those literature experts or teenagers but a wider range of people, and for different reasons. I am not a child but i would say that i love love in all its shapes i love the idea of falling in love and flushing and all that stuff that occurs once in a lifetime (or maybe even more times?)<br /><br />anyway im a romantic and besides de core theme of bdsm its a romantic novel..wont say anything about the unnerving repetitions..leave them aside and enjoy the reading. i am a non native english speaker and off course i know how beautiful the english language is... maybe just not in this particular book.
B008B1VYP0|5.0|I enjoyed music!! so this is good. I think is a nice cd they did i do recommend all do i dont understand why some time they have to curse.
B008673ZAQ|2.0|I was disappointed in Reflected In You.  The story felt rushed and confusing.  The characters contradicted themselves constantly and I hated the pet names.  Gideon's back story was completely glossed over and rushed through.  His moods were annoying and I felt like she demeaned herself throughout the relationship.  I thought it would start evolving into a sweeter love story but it was just vulgar.
B007TK77QE|5.0|Chatty and immediately comfortable to read. It has well-observed characters, nowhere near as much profanity as some reviewers would have you believe, and a really decent, plausible story line. A really good holiday read - not highbrow \\"literature\\".
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Had to really work at it to solve this game, which was surprising given the inexpensive price. I definitely recommend getting this app!
B0053TMP24|5.0|This book is another great book by Rick Riordan.  He keeps you in suspense and wanting to read more.  I love how he explains things so you can really picture it in your mind.  The battles that the demi-gods fight and all the unique creatures. I can't wait to read more of his books.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I found it amazing with the same characters and not much external conflict changing the sequel could get better. The sex was still hot but in this book the characters spent more time baring themselves open emotionally and more time was devoted to their angst and jealous drive to possess each other. Trust is paramount in a relationship where the characters are as jealous as these two are and in this book they worked on analyzing that and working towards fixing it. Sort of.<br /><br />Gideon still hasn't opened up emotionally to Eva, baring his secrets or his soul. He never returns the words, \\"I love you\\" after she says them to him repeatedly until the very end and by then it may be too late. His actions and his refusal to tell Eva what happened during certain events is like a big red flag. She should suspect he is cheating and all the things going on in the book made me question if they really should be together until the very end.<br /><br />The tension was on a much deeper level this time than in Bared to You and it wasn't all about the sex. There is a deep seated unexplainable need for each other that is stronger than any addiction.<br /><br />Excellent book and recommended if you can handle the emotional roller coaster.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|The reviewers that are saying this book gives out classified info and that he shouldn't have wrote it are confused. Obama and the White House leaked more information than this book ever could have. No tactical secrets are given, it's just being in the mind of a SEAL and what it's like to be a part of history. This book was very well written and funny at times. It makes me so proud that we have Men that put their lives on the line without a political agenda. It needed to be written to give a true account of what happened..unless You want to wait for the government to do it? Keep waiting! Long Live The Brotherhood!
B004JHY8A8|4.0|I could not put this book down once I had started it, it involved tears, joy and sorrow - should be on everyone's must read list!
B005IQZB14|5.0|Cheryl is a subperb writer. I felt as if I was on the PCT with her,not only in hiking but also in her thought process. Cheryl's trek has inspired me to look into myself.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app is amazing. A little blurry and has some bugs. Doesn't have all the features that Pc version has but still fun. I would regimens this app!!!
0316228532|5.0|What I loved about this book is that each and every character is 'disgustingly human'.  They are our friends and family, our neighbors and co-workers, and even ourselves.  Ms. Rowling reminds us that \\"the line between good and evil cuts through every human heart\\".
0316776963|4.0|I enjoy David Sedaris' writing, and he hasn't done me wrong yet.  But the first book of his that I read, \\"Naked\\", I found to be funnier.  This is having its moments where I crack up, but overall, it's just a good thing to read while on public transport.  It puts me in a good mood, I like his descriptions of different incidents in his life.  It makes me wish I were a friend of his.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This was a stunning sequel! Can't wait until book 3! Gideon was a powerhouse of strength in this book. I loved it and so will you.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I would give this MOVIE a big 5 star, simply because it was SUPER AMAZING!!!  The characters were totally AWESOME and also very funny at the same time.  The technolgy was super GREAT with the SUPER<br />effects!!  It was very amusing and very intense at the same time.  I would TOTALLY recommend this<br />movie too EVERYONE..... TOTALLY ENJOYABLE,  Thanks, Movie Critic!!
B008G8SFGO|4.0|This will be long!<br /><br />First my short review of MONSTER:<br />I think this album is a logical progression upward from Sonic Boom. It's heavier and does sound like a cross between Destroyer and Revenge to me. I think the song quality is improved and that's largely due to the band gelling more as a recording unit. Tommy in particular has injected much more of his own vibe of guitar playing into this record and the band just sounds fun and heavy (and a bit menacing) in their writing and performance on Monster. I'm a musician and long time fan, so I listen for this stuff on music released by any band I'm a fan of.<br /><br />My KISSTORY lesson:<br />First off, I've been a HUGE fan since I first heard the studio version of \\"C'Mon and Love Me\\" on the radio in 1975. I have every album, love all versions of the band and can find merit in all of their recordings. This is not meant to piss anyone off, it's my opinion on the music and members of KISS.<br /><br />For everyone who just can't accept the band unless it's the original four and think KISS is misleading it's fans, I ask you to consider what I write here with an open mind. It will be really tough for some of you...<br /><br />\\"It's the original four or nothing. Everything else sucks\\"<br />Let's take a look at the albums and who played on them. I've read where Ace, and especially Peter have bitched about the current band and how it's not really Kiss without them. Peter in particualr has been very disrespectful to Tommy and Eric.<br /><br />Bob Kulick, Dick Wagner, Vinnie Vincent, Tommy Thayer, etc...<br />Ace didn't play all of the leads on Destroyer (judging from that lazy solo on \\"Sweet Pain\\" that's on Destroyer Resurrected, I see why Bob Ezrin dumped it). Ace didn't play on most of the studio side of Alive II. Ace hardly played on The Elder and didn't play a note on Creatures or the Killers compilation. Tommy Thayer played on most of Psycho Circus.<br /><br />Anton Fig, Kevin Valentine, etc...<br />Aparently Peter was so unable to play well on Dynasty that he only appears on one track and isn't on Unmasked at all. As for Psycho Circus, Peter drums on one song only and I understand why they used a sub judging from that. As for Alive II, which is considered a classic, I was shocked at how bad Peter's performance is on the live tracks. All the swagger and jazzy fills he did on the studio records are nowhere to be found. A huge let down as Peter is BRILLIANT on the first Alive.<br /><br />Kiss has always used ghost players. Even on the later albums they used Rick Derringer, Robben Ford, Bruce Kulick, Jean Beauvoir and more subbing for Eric Carr, Vinnie Vincent and Gene Simmons. Sometimes a band member just can't get the part right. It's happened to me in the bands I was in.<br /><br />Live:<br />I've seen Kiss live on every tour but Revenge and seen tons of live video from every era starting with seeing them live on the original Alive tour. Comparing the current band with the reunion tour of the original four, all I can say is I was bored and sat down for most of the concert during the reunion and I was on my feet cheering during the Sonic Boom tour. It seemed Ace and Peter didn't want to be there and it showed on the reunion tour. They did it for the money. Period. All of Ace and Peter's arguments regarding their makeup and new members wearing it fails on every level to me when you consider that Ace played with Eric Singer in the Catman makeup and Peter played and recorded Symphony (Peter sounds great on Symphony btw) with Tommy as the Spaceman.<br /><br />It didn't seem to bother them then...Peter was so unable to play well on Dynasty that he only appears on one track and isn't on Unmasked at all.

B007THA4FI|5.0|A true English novel.This author never disapoints in settings, characters or plot.Was sad when it ended.Looking forward to the next book by this author.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I really like spider. It is one of my favorite games on my Kindle. Time really gets away from when I play.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|mind you this game is fun but its really repetitive and gets old quick. I couldn't imagine paying full price for this. the graphics are nice as well as the music, but that gets really repetitive as well.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|The game is fun and gets harder as I progress.  Now it won't open...I even tried turning my Kindle Fire on and off to no avail.
034580404X|5.0|This book didn't even meet my expectations. It has exceeded them. Oh my gosh! It is so erotic and exciting to find thing that you and your partner or spouse can explore together. It is a page turner so be prepared to jot want to put it down. If you work early give yourself at least three hours to read so you won't be so tired in the morning from reading because you couldn't put it down.
B0039UTDFG|2.0|The only thing more epic than the cinematography is the EPIC failure by the producers in choosing the narrator. No one cares to hear Oprah narrate this.<br />There is a reason this version has been selling cheap for so long...
B005721W9O|5.0|I loved Galaxy Quest when it first came out. Always thought it was well-produced with good effects and great jokes about Trekkers. Since I also love Star Trek, I don't get why some people were so insulted by this sweet movie. And the cast is simply brilliant! Tim Allen is perfect, as is Alan Rickman, Sigourney Weaver, Tony Shaloub and Sam Rockwell. Enrico Colantoni who played Mathesar is now on TV's \\"Flashpoint\\". Great stuff.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|wonderful game kept busy guessing what was going to happen next.graphics were great looked real good on my kindle fire hd.would like more games like this
B009329Y30|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie, that I had to buy another one to share! Nicholas Sparks created a wonderful book and the movie brought it to life!
B0002V7O3I|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  I had seen it years ago when it came out and had forgotten much of it other than I remembered that I liked it.  I have a 13 year old grandson that I just knew would enjoy this movie as well and I wanted to share it with him.  He enjoyed it even more than I expected. Very good movie for kids.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|*this game is an awesome way to pass the time.you just get so into it and it becomes so addictive*(I LUV IT)*
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|I started reading these books as part of a program where I read to sixth grade students and facilitated a book chat.  I have finished the Percy Jackson Series, am waiting for the next book in the Heroes of Olympus series, and I am hooked! As a middle school administrator, I love talking to students about these books! This book, like the rest, was wonderful!  I cannot wait to see what adventures Annabeth and Percy get into!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I enjoyed the first book and I think I read that one twice.  Usually, the follow ups are a little less enjoyable since you lose that sense of discovery and you expect certain things out of the characters that authors may not feel.  But Sylvia Day didn't allow the reader to lose that sense of discovery at any time in this book.  Per usual, her writing is expressive and well-detailed.  Awesome job!
B008G8SFGO|5.0|Following Sonic Boom should have been a difficult undertaking, however being a KISS fan since before I was born I know better than to question KISSs' ability to make music. This album is nothing like Sonic Boom but is a fantastic KISS album and great hard rock album in general. I'm not going to do a song by song comparison but rest assured if you are a KISS fan get this album, you will love it. Several of the songs are catchy and you will find yourself humming them later (Freak seems to be in my head currently). If your not a card carrying KISS ARMY member don't run away, you will be more than pleased with this album. Paul's voice is a good as ever, Gene's bass playing is better than ever, and Eric and Tommy do a fantastic job as well.  Get MONSTER and enjoy!
B005FMZWD8|2.0|I was forced to return this watch Invicta 1513 because since first week I discover that the watch use to stop. I changed even the battery with new one but same thing unfortunately it happen again.<br />I hope that it happen only to me. I really want to order this model again but but I have no guarantee that the next one will not stop too. If others meet same situation please write down.<br />The strap have a strong smell of vinegar, maybe the inside leather was not treated enough.<br />In my opinion this watch fit well with a silicone strap.<br />Hope my experience to be useful.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I just finished reading this book, the latest installment in the Hero's series by Rick Riordan, to my 7 yr. old son who has been completely fascinated with these books since hearing about the first Percy Jackson installment shortly after it was released. We haven't missed a book in all 3 of the series and we still can't wait for the next book to be released as the consistency of enjoyment and learning about Greek, Roman, and Egyptian mythology has been equally enjoyed by 50+ dad and 7 yr. old son has become a staple of bedtime reading daily .
B008XG1X18|3.0|while I absolutely Love the Pinterest site, I am hooked, I love to see what others \\"pin\\" and I think it's great you can click on picture of a Food or drink item and get a recipe for it! Awesome! As I've heard before, you can't just check out one thing on it and Yes, that is correct. However, I'm not as pleased with the freezing up/dropped web page. It seems to do it quite often? I not sure if this is the site itself? or the Amazon site causing the problem?
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Excelent product, lots of extras, just disappointed waiting on the avengers assembled box set. Cant wait for Iron man 3 in the theaters. Interesting the Bios on the disc and the mini movie on the bluray.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|This is the 2nd book of the Crossfire novels and I looked forward to reading it.  Can't compare to Fifty Shades which I think is better.  I enjoyed the read and can't wait for the 3rd book coming out at the end of December.  The author tries to make the story richer but in the process just confuses the reader because she doesn't let the male character divulge any information about himself so you don't know why he is behaving the way he is until the very end.
B008IGP8QE|5.0|Amazing CD my nephew loved it.<br />I think ROSS LYNCH is so cute <33 ::)<br />The songs are really catchy.
B001E6X4W0|5.0|I've seen this movie over a dozen times. All the great actors from the 90's play in it. One of the best vampire movies out there.
B008LSVL6U|5.0|Steven Wilson is really setting new directions in music. There is no other sound like this. All musicians are very talented, creative and one can see that they are in heaven. I was very impressed because except for Steven Wilson, the others are not well known in the music business. I was happy to observe the respect of SW for the great King Crimson as one his major influences, since his music show this many times. I think Steven is doing very much like Miles Davis: moving ahead, discovering and promoting new talented musicians and creating very,very good music. Thanks Steven!!
B008673ZAQ|2.0|I loved the first book, the second book was mostly them in therapy and whining, didn't love it.  Not sure I will purchase the third in the series when it is out in December. I can't take anymore whining.
B000NGTJTY|5.0|How could this not be a great film with the director & the cast of actors involved. I usually don't watch this type of film, but I checked it out because of the actors involved & am glad I did. Great writing, directing, acting, etc. If I could give it more stars I would.
1469984202|5.0|Whatever I expected, this wasn't it: it's an interlocking set of character pieces about the inhabitants of (what you come to realize is) a huge underground bunker housing the remnants of humanity after some long-ago apocalyptic event. The stories follow the chronologically interwoven accounts of a handful of individuals living in this unique setting. As their accounts progress, it becomes clear that the same terrible secret lies at the heart of every tragedy they grapple with.<br /><br />This is ostensibly science fiction, but, like the excellent I Am Legend, it uses its sci-fi trappings as a way to explore some enduring questions about humanity. Howey's writing style is both mature and approachable, and the attractiveness of the human element in the story rises naturally to the surface, without being encumbered by the post-apocalyptic setting. Really, the most remarkable thing about the silo is how real and familiar it feels. These are just ordinary people. Sure, they live in a kilometer-deep hole in the ground, but their society is as human as our own. It is this familiarity that makes the struggle hidden in the community so compelling. A very enjoyable read; I look forward to more.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love the pinterest app. I find so much information using this app...from recipes to the latest fashions. I like that I can share a page or link with this app on a cell phone.
B000095K7A|1.0|I placed an order recently for the vinyl of this album. The album is one of my favorites so that was not the issue. When I received the package instead of the vinyl, they had sent the cd. I found that very disappointing.
B007THA4FI|4.0|A Casual Vacancy is a good read. J.K.Rowling writes well for adults, too.  One criticism:  at times I had trouble keeping up with the characters. There were plenty of them, and they moved quickly from plot twist to plot twist. But the book was entertaining, and it struck at some serious points -- such as the ongoing  fight over how  the fortunate should deal with the downtrodden. The book spoke to the battle between those who want to help the poor, and those  who want to keep all their stuff and everybody else be damned. As a side note, American readers will pick up a lot of British speak from reading this book. Who knew that \\"shagging\\" means, well, never mind.
B009QW6ZT8|4.0|This was a fantastic episode. You can tell that Rick is really starting to crack. I did deduct one star because of the simple fact that AMC cannot get the deal done with Dish and I was forced to watch this on Amazon.
0439813786|5.0|I actually loved this book even if it was half pictures I still liked it I think if it was juss words I woulda liked it more but it kept the story going with the pictures
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Great way to pass the time!  Its fun to try and improve your time solving the puzzles .  I really enjoy it!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is the absolute best calculator for Kindle that I have found. It works better than a regular calculator and it has a place you can click to review your history. Amazing, I highly recommend this app.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Once I took the time to let it calibrate, this app gives great info on the battery life and charging.
B00181JGI2|5.0|Nothing less than five stars for the dude! If you haven't seen the movie, it's a must! And yes-I agree the rug really did tie the room together.
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|I like this product,the only thing is how long it took to arrive. I was hoping to recieve it sooner.
B0017WCERM|1.0|Out of all the reissues  the only lp's that work for me are kill em all which is probly the only one worth getting it sounds better than the rest. Ride the lightning plays ok, but doesn't sound any near as good as the cd and the cd is miles away from sounding as good as the original lp. Puppets is the worst of all of em. I tried multiple copys on multiple players with differnt stylus. You would be better off getting original lp's anyway cuz these reissues are very dull n lifeless when compared. I sent my reisses back n amazon was good about the refund.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I'm collecting all the seasons of this wonderful show.  Everyone I know loves this story and all the characters involved.  The acting is impeccable, the plot is full of adventure and drama, and the costumes and scenery are always perfection.  Can't wait for Season 3.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This was another Entertaining read by Rick Riordan.  I really cannot imagine why these books are not made into movies.  I know the first one was, although they altered the storyline.  Find that the books are engaging and creative, and don't insult the intelligence of the readers.  I look forward to his next book.  They are my guilty pleasures!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app. It's user friendly. Very easy to find the Bible verses. It's. the best app for your soul!
B006SMLAMQ|2.0|The first install was buggy and would not add locations correctly. Regarding functionality, I found The Weather Channel and eWeather HD to be my favorite weather products.
B002KV4NTQ|5.0|Sticky Fingers is in my opinion the Rolling Stones best, bluesiest recording ever. The strong lead guitar riffs on Sway & Can't You Here Me Knocking? still boost my endorphin levels before I run or work out!
B005LAII8A|4.0|In the future(2074)time travel has been discovered, but it is illegal and used only by the most powerful criminals on the black market as a form of body disposal .There gangsters use time travel illegally as a technique to commit assassination without leaving evidence,using `loopers' in the past(2044) to do the killing of potential victims. Those who fun afoul of the syndicates are hog-tied and sent back in time to 2044, where they are met by a \\"looper\\" with a shotgun.He finishes the job, takes his reward (bars of silver strapped to the victim),and waits for his next assignment. Young Joe(Joseph Gordon-Levitt) drives round the city in a flash car,takes designer drugs,has a prostitute girlfriend.<br /><br />Young Joe arrives in a rural field outside of the poverty-stricken city every day and waits for his victims to appear, executing them with a quick shot from his enormous gun (referred to here as his \\"blunderbuss\\") and tossing them into an incinerator. The only catch is that, at some point, every looper must \\"close the loop\\" and kill their future self to close their contracts, a stipulation that Joe has trouble with when his older self (Bruce Willis) arrives and escapes his certain fate.Young Joe is at the mercy of his gang lord boss Abe(Jeff Daniels),a slovenly hood.Old Joe's escape is to ensure the demise of a mysterious crime lord from the future,the Rainmaker,the future's criminal mastermind,who when preparing to send old Joe back killed his wife,and now plans to erase all loopers.Old Joe enlists the help of young Joe in his attempt to prevent this possible future.He hunts for 2 people who might be the future Rainmaker.,while young Joe finds himself protecting a 3rd candidate, Cid,and his mother Sara(Emily Blunt).This sub-plot is more compelling emotionally,the isolated woman with a special child,and played with fanatastic panache by Blunt and Gagnon.<br /><br />If something happens in the current timeline it retrospectively effects the future.If you put fun over logic then this film works.Time travel does work in a way that allows the events of Looper to occur.Set in Kansas 2044,the crime-ridden dystopia is decked out with all sorts of futuristic gadgetry:computer screens as thin as glass, telekinesis, hyper-stylized drugs and weaponry,hover-cycles,floating crop dusters.The film has beautiful story-telling,superb characters,surprising and disconcerting,an animated drive,a front-loaded narration,an entertaining romp mixing sci-fi and western genres with great themes.Rian Johnson has proved why he's an interesting director/ writer,with allusions to 12 Monkeys,Terminator,Source Code,Omen and Children of the Corn.But no lesser for that,showing an intelligent organisation of such elements. Lastly JGL has been made up to look like a young BW with knobs on!
B009QW6ZT8|5.0|Season 3 starts just like the comic book. I love it, watching my favorite comic book come alive its amazing. Love season 3.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I love what Gideon and Eva have built. I can‘t wait for the third book to see what happens next.
B003V1WXKU|5.0|Feynman was certainly one of the great American scientists. He helped develop the atom bomb when he was in his early 20's, taught physics on the highest level, shared in a Nobel Prize, and had a lot of fun learning new things all the way.  It's a delightful journey that he takes us on, and I recommend his reminiscences without reservation.<br /><br />Eugene F. Shewmaker
B00138H876|5.0|Blood on the Tracks remains my favorite Dylan album. The sarcasm, wit, creativity cannot be matched. This is Dylan at his height of the mid sixties poetry.
0205313426|4.0|There's not to much to be said about The Elements of Style.  It's a strongly written style and grammar guide that can be a bit outdated at times, but the writing's so strong you kinda wanna be outdated.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|if you like bejewelled you'll certainly like this game. I like the quest aspect of it...gives a sense of purpose...not just get a high score
6305313687|5.0|I had seen this movie several times in the past and was blown away. I purchased it because I wanted my kids to see it. I always think they should see thought provoking movies on such subjects as this.<br />They really liked it a lot and couldn't believe how people were acting. But it made them see how and what hatred can do to a person. I am glad they watched it.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|can't put it down. But when I finished yhe last round, it took me back to the beginning.  Not much of an ending.  I gave it a 5 star becsuse I truly enjoyed the puzzles, the obstacles and the graphics.  Happy playing.
B008TMA1LY|5.0|Love this game, I would definitely rate it 5/5. So glad I got it on the free side of things.
030758836X|5.0|Gone Girl is an unusual and compelling read with plot turns as numerous as convolutions to the human brain.  Congratulations to Gillian Flynn for a remarkable book.  I highly recommend it.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I am about 40% through the book and at this point, it is one of my favorite King novels. Unless it suddenly gets very bad, which I don't expect, it may be one of the best he has written.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|It is a good game to zone out and relax.  You don't. need to be a rocket scientist and it is very easy.
B002BI6SMI|1.0|This movie could have been really good. I had a hard time relating to the main character, he seemed phoney and ingenue. If the plot is going to such a stretch (the kidnapped girls father happens to be a retired spy?, Really?), then the other shit has to be believable. I don't know if a lot got cut out during the editing or if it was just poorly directed. I wonder if the directors cut is any better. Two thumbs up on saving his daughters virginity though!!!!! Stupid!
B008673ZAQ|4.0|It was a good book, but I got very frustrated with the back and forth struggle between Eva and Gideon. I won't give too much away by by being specific, but they were very rarely together and happy. Regardless of that, I'm looking forward to the next book.
B0099G6Q5E|5.0|i love this soundtrack,i wish it had some of the remixes that \\"becca\\" made in the movie. those were awesome...but i havent stopped listening to this soundtrack!!!! LOVE IT!!!
B0091REZMW|4.0|I really love games like this but I wish that you won more diamonds when you leveled up. most ppl don't want to spend their money buying diamonds. otherwise this is a pretty cool game that passes the time when your bored
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|I tried the trial version of Call of Atlantis and loved it. It's great fun and completely addicting. Game runs perfectly on my Kindle Fire and the graphics are beautiful. However, $4.99 is just too much for a match three game in my opinion. If not for the price I would definitely give Call of Atlantis a 5 star rating. Thankfully, Amazon finally offered it as the FAOTD and I have been enjoying the full version ever since. Thanks Amazon!
1401937519|5.0|Wonderful book! I've been reading voraciously all my life, researching the age-old question: \\"Who are we? What are we? Why are we here?  I accept totally what Moorjani says because it jibes with so many other books I've read. Don't buy the book until you've read some reviews first.  For instance:  If you can't wrap your brain around the concept of reincarnation, take a pass.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I have enjoyed this game on a PC.  I enjoy it more with the touch screen on the Kindle Fire.  Great to relax and unwind.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|Very addictive,  love graphics and concept!  Reminds me of an easier relaxing puzzel quest.  I wish the free version allowed you to keep replaying levels so you can finish your tank!
0307891402|5.0|I picked up the game Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim but quickly found myself lost in the game. I thought picking up this guide might aid in my gaming and help keep track of the items and missions.<br /><br />This Game guide is a hard cover and is built to last which is a good thing. The game is so large you will constantly be referencing to this book. Soft-back game guides have a tendency to have pages come loose from the glue that attaches them to the spine which I feel will not be an issue here.<br /><br />The content of the game guide is incredible! It is mentioned that the company ,Prima, took over 2,000 hours to complete and it shows!<br /><br />You have a walk through on the main quest, side quest, information on how to beat the enemies, locations for items as well as information on items, weapons, and armor.<br /><br />PROS:<br />++ Hard Cover and built to last<br />++ Detailed and very informative<br /><br />CONS:<br />++ Included map is glued and small<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br />This guide is a must for anyone that is playing Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim let it be a fan of the series who wants every task completed or someone that is new and needs assistance.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|so far its a great app...would deff recomend to friends. and family..I really really like it.plus its free and easy to use!!!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Great app, better than iPad Web version. Easy to pin and view. Visually pleasing. Highly recommend this app if you like pinterest.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I got this book on my Kindle a couple of days ago and i can't put it down! Unless my mom calls me to do my HW :).  But other than that it is very addicting!<br />I think if you were thinking about buying this book, and if you did, you wouldn't be able to put it down!<br /><br />:)

B005MYEQ4U|4.0|The film was quirky and enjoyable, with Woody Allen's hand so clearly in it that Owen Wilson could have been Woody Allen if you'd colored his hair, made him shorter, and put glasses on him.<br /><br />I'm the time travel movies examiner for The Examiner, and I'm working through the problems and expect to start posting them in a few weeks; you can find the index of those posts at Temporal Anomalies in Popular Time Travel Movies: The Examiner Connection (Amazon won't post the link, so you'll have to Google that) as soon as they appear (and meanwhile other time travel movies are listed there).<br /><br />--M.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|I was reluctant about reading this book because \\"Bared to You\\"  seemed to mimic \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" initially.  However, I must say I enjoyed \\"Reflected in You\\" so much that once I started to read it, I couldn't put it down!  The plot is very strong in my opinion.  I found myself drawn into their (Gideon and Eva's) world.  Gideon's wealth was appealing, but the brokenness that he and Eva shared was very heart wrenching.  It is a story which resonates within the hearts and minds of broken people in search of wholeness. The title of the book is thought provoking as well. I would highly recommend this book to anyone from age 24 to 64.  Thank you Sylvia Day and I look forward to book three of this series.
B0015DWJX2|3.0|I was confused when Sophie began to write for Julia. I went back until Julia talked about Dawsey. All in allot was delightful reading. Glad it was on our Book Club reading.
B0053O89RY|5.0|No doubt one of the best situation comedies EVER on US television.  Our family loves to watch these episodes over and over.  We couldn't wait to receive this DVD, which arrived on the day it was released.  Thanks, Amazon!
B003WKLOTQ|5.0|I love this movie. I love the interactions and the peek into different \\"norms\\". Beautiful babies, families and vistas tell the story-- no words needed.
0529064847|5.0|Book arrived in very good condition.  All the pages are yellow and I wish it looked a little better.  Otherwise, everything else was fine.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|This is just a fun movie. Not the best probably from a critics standpoint, but both my wife and I enjoyed the movie. If you are looking for a really fun movie night, and you are over 55 years old, I recommend this movie. I think you have to be a little older and to have had some life experiences to really appreciate the humor in the movie.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I was hooked in the early pages and the book kept me edge of seat all the way through.  When I thought I knew what was going to happen it would go in a different direction.  It was a great, thrilling read from beginning to end.  But really darn scary for a parent of teen boys to read!!
B006LSZECO|1.0|I would not recommend this book to anyone  My book club is reading it and it may lead to a good discussion.  but the two main characters i hoped would both die by the end of the book.
1619695006|5.0|I had been looking forward The Casual Vacancy and particularly the audio version read by the brilliant Tom Hollander ever since I first learned that he was doing it.  I may be a bit biased being a huge fan of anything Mr Hollander performs. He has the uncanny ability to paint a visual image of each character in whatever story he is reading. I am also a fan of JK Rowling and the two together are pure magic though not the Harry Potter type by any means. The story is grim and there are a lot of characters but somehow you become a part of their lives and by the end I found myself with tears in my eyes, wondering what they were doing after the story ended. In my opinion Ms Rowling has proven that she can write anything! I can't wait to see what is next!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Great read, really follows greatly with the two previous book, and the ending leaves a similar feeling than the other Rick Riordan Books. What is going to happen next and when is the next book gonna be published? All in all, great book, and the direct to Kindle version is awesome, no delays.
B005OT2YVA|2.0|There's so much to say about what's dumb about this movie, but it has one thing going for it: pretty colors flickering fast. A great movie when you want to give your brain a rest. Best viewed on mute.
0061906220|5.0|I am a pre-school special education and used Pete the Cat I love My White Shoes to teach colors.  My kids LOVED it.  I expanded many lessons using the book and lots of arts and crafts activities.  When I introduced this 2nd book the kids had already fallen in love with Pete, so they were ready to be wowed.  They loved this one as much as the first and of course the many lessons and activities that I was able to create because of this book.<br />Definitely worth the price.  For my purposes, the other Pete the Cat books are too difficult for my students, but teachers in K and first  loved all the other Pete the Cat books.<br />Enjoy

0439813786|5.0|The Invention of Hugo Cabret is a marvelous book that literally takes the phrase \\"A picture is worth a thousand words\\" to the next level. The entire story is told with well-written words and beautifully drawn images that entirely draw the reader in, and the plot has a very interesting twist at the end.<br /><br />  The book follows the life of Hugo Cabret, a Parisian orphan, who lives in the Paris Train Station.<br /><br />  His father was a clock maker who sometimes helped in a Paris Museum. One day, when he was in the museum, he found an \\"automaton,\\" a robotic man like a wind-up toy, only infinitely more complicated. The machine was in a bad state, but he decided to fix it.<br /><br />  One night, he was fixing the machine when the museum's guard locked him into the museum by accident.<br /><br />  No one knew how, but it burned down completely by morning.<br /><br />  Hugo was taken in by his usually drunken uncle, and taught how to maintain the station clocks, but one day, his uncle vanished, and never came back.<br /><br />  Hugo ran, ran with no intent whatsoever, and found himself at the museums ruins.<br /><br />  And then he saw the automaton, lying in an even worse state than before.<br /><br />  Hugo convinced himself that somehow, his father had left a message to him within that automaton, and the rest of the book is devoted to his adventures that revolve around fixing it.<br /><br />  The plot is interesting enough, and Hugo is amazingly done. You truly understand him as a shy, lonely child who wants a friend but is unwilling to let anyone in. You see his love of things that he did with his father, and you especially see his love for his father himself.<br /><br />  Now, we come to the pictures.<br /><br />  The pictures, drawn by the author, are SPECTACULAR. The shading in each separate one (and there are over a hundred) beautifully draws out the characters, showing deepness and richness. They show you the bustling environment of Paris, and they show the buildings, made up of carved stone. They TELL the story as well: the writing on one page will end, and then a series of pictures will show what happens next, capturing the atmosphere in ways no ordinary book can.<br /><br />  Ever since I first read this book, I fell in love with it. The writing is superb, and pictures are amazing, the characters are developed.... The only possible thing I would ask for is MORE of it.<br /><br />However, I do have one criticism:<br />Throughout the book, Hugo and Isabelle (another main character) both lie and steal.<br />Hugo, because he needs food and doesn't want to be taken to the orphanage,and Isabelle.... because she wants too.<br />Now, for the most part they don't have very many repercussions for these things, which is not good to teach a young child.<br />HOWEVER, as a result of these events, Hugos fingers are painfully smashed in a door, breaking them, and Isabelle breaks her leg. Her godparents (who took her in when her parents died) have their faith in her seriously shaken as well, and you can tell that this hurts her.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book to any person; but, if it's a younger child, parents might want to discuss the problems with lieing and stealing, to make sure that they don't try it themselves.<br /><br />Thank you for reading.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|I've read quite a few of the reviews on here, and I know there are some backwards things about the case, but I couldn't afford the higher priced case quite honestly. This case is a bit stiff, but holds the Kindle device in place at different angles very well. As far as the charger issue, I keep the case open when I charge my Kindle. The case really helps me, because I have trouble holding things with my left hand, and it was making my left hand ache to hold the device and read or play games. I haven't watched a movie on it yet with the stand, but I know the stand will make things easier on me to watch movies. Before I received the stand the Kindle device kept slipping around on me, but now it stays in place no matter which angle I have it in.<br /><br />All-in-all, I know this device isn't 100% perfect, but I really love it. Now I don't have to worry about breaking my Kindle if I drop it in this protective case. I know the case will protect it from damage of almost any kind. I highly recommend it for anyone looking for a bargain and a good product at the same time.

0062127241|4.0|I read this book coming on the heels of having read Fletcher's Dear Boy about Keith Moon, and the Wilkerson biography of Pete Townshend.  Both of those books were riveting because they transported me to London in the 1960's so exquisitely.  I would say London in the 1960's is a time and place we all fantasize about living, it is akin to the belle epoque in paris.  This book does not do that for me, which is fine, it is more a chance to learn about his personality, his thoughts, his feelings.  It is his memoirs and the narrative feels like sitting in with the didactic between he and his psychotherapist.  I have always known that he is sensitive, emotional, in touch with his feelings and not one to hold things in, he seems to wear his emotions on his sleeve.  This book is intriguing and well worth reading for anyone that feels a fondness for this musician and philosopher.  I don't think it would be so interesting to someone who has a casual appreciation for Townshend, much less someone reading it rather capriciously and not feeling anything a priori about him at all.<br /><br />As far as the content, I would have appreciated more insight and feelings from him regarding the death of Keith Moon, perhaps there isn't a whole lot to break down about someone who simply partied himself to death. I did appreciate his descriptions of the romances in his life, some of them deeply emotional, others more salacious and carnal. One of the central recurring themes in this book is water, the purifier, and how Pete is continually drawn to it for a reprieve from the madness, I liked that.  I always thought Pete was a tortured soul and that he had suffered a lot for some reason.  I likened him to Oscar Wilde, F Scott Fitzgerald, or James Joyce.  What I learned is that much of his life was in fact idyllic and that his threshold for sharing insecurity and sorrow was just much lower than most.  If anything this book taught me how an individual, highly accomplished, achieved much due to hisongoing mental healing and cleansing.  It seems he always took any insecurity, any sadness, any negative thought and he got it out, he earnestly made sure that he healed it, that he took care of his mind.  He shared everything, he saw therapists, he engaged in groups and social connections, he assuaged difficulty spiritually, and again and again he went to the water.  All in all, I would say this was a book about a man that has spent his whole life adeptly dealing with all the travails of life one after the other, taking them on as they came, and he did it with great dexterity.  This is what the book left my mind with, and thus it has inspired me in a way that says - take care of yourself.  This is what makes this book different, it is a rock n roll story that does not end in complete self destruction, but conversely its about a man that ends up being self constructive and thus there is a happy ending.<br /><br />Subjectively, I always thought I connected with Pete because I had such a traumatic, sorrow filled childhood.  After reading Pete's thoughts about his childhood I realize that there is really no comparison.  When Pete describes being at grandma Denny's and his door being unlocked at night and what a dark time it was, I thought give me a break, this is nothing compared to the craziness of my life.  I am a Doctor and have many patients that are completely debilitated by their childhoods.  Pete's childhood was relatively idyllic compared to the complete craziness of millions of people who struggle every day of their lives with that trauma.  Nevertheless, the trauma of Pete's childhood disturbed him and he seems to have sorted it out throughout his life in such a healthy way.  I come away from the book not feeling as connected, I thought his life was much more traumatic than what he described.  I feel now that he just has a much lower threshold for sharing emotions that many others would consider a trifle comparatively.  Regardless, the book taught me to be active about negative energy, don't just sit and take it, scratch and claw your way out of it, fight, never stop, continue to work at it, don't wallow.  That is the key message from this book, his memoirs, it really is a man writing out his feelings throughout his life, its not so much about rock n roll, its about how someone healed his mind.

B005HSL626|4.0|it is really fun for awhile and good for traveling or sick days when you have nothing else to do!
B009IQ1HBI|5.0|No Sophomore slump here for Ellie.  In fact, this album FAR surpasses \\"Lights\\" as a whole.  \\"Lights\\" had several good tracks, but for the most part it was a pretty light album.  \\"Halcyon\\" is much deeper, both lyrically and musically.  Ellie has crafted the perfect blend of pop, indie rock, folk, and electronic.  This album almost has a \\"Florence + The Machine\\" sound to it in parts.  I will create a track by track review later on, but let me note that the standout tracks on Halcyon are \\"My Blood\\", \\"Figure 8\\", \\"Explosions\\", \\"I Know You Care\\", \\"Ritual\\" (Bonus Track), \\"In My City\\" (Bonus Track), and \\"Lights (Single Version [Bonus Track]).  \\"My Blood\\" is an entirely new sound for Ellie and is the song she said was her personal favorite on the album.  I wouldn't go quite that far, but it is undoubtably one of the best songs on the album, and it should definitely be released as a single.  \\"Figure 8\\" is in my opinion hands down not only the best song on the album, but the best song Ellie has ever recorded.  It DEFINITELY needs to be released as a single.  Both \\"Figure 8\\" and \\"Ritual\\" would surely see \\"Lights\\" like success here in the US.  \\"Explosions\\" and \\"I Know You Care\\" slow things down a bit, but are both excellent songs.  \\"Ritual\\" is one of the best three songs on the album (along with \\"Figure 8\\" and \\"My Blood\\").  Not sure why in the world she made it a bonus track.  That being said, \\"Lights\\" was a bonus track on \\"Bright Lights\\", and I also thought \\"Lights\\" was the best on that album.  \\"Ritual\\" could be the \\"Lights\\" of this album should she release it as a single.  Both are bonus tracks, and it has a very similar sound to \\"Lights\\" to it.  It is almost like \\"Lights\\" meets \\"Florence + The Machine\\" with it's addition of a harp and the haunting background vocals.  \\"In My City\\" is a favorite of mine.  It is extremely catchy.  \\"Lights (Single Version)\\" was the song that introduced me to Ellie, and remains my favorite off her first album, so I am happy that they included it on here as a bonus track.  Again will go into further detail with a track by track review later, but those are the standouts on \\"Halcyon\\".  There are several other phenomenal songs not mentioned in this review however, though there are also several duds.  I almost gave \\"Halcyon\\" a 4 due to the duds.  The other songs are so out of this world incredible, though, I couldn't give what is easily the best release of 2012 (thus far) a 4/5!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved loved this book.  I couldn't put it down.  I have already got (2) girls reading it.<br />I am so excited to read the third book......
0143120530|5.0|This as a fun read with many humorous anecdotes and a great balance between back story and his own journey of participatory journalism. I would recommend this book to anyone there were many times I laughed out loud of his description of this underground geeky event. I also was impressed with his pacing and storytelling overall. This was a quick read that was engaging and to me brought a lot of new information and ideas.  Just the image of him in his parent's basement with thick headphones and blacked out sunglasses learning pages of random number had me laughing outloud. It was a very honest account of his experiences with a good interplay of research and probing I really enjoyed this book and recommend it to anyone looking for a fresh read with food for thought.

0385342063|5.0|This is by far my favorite Kinsella book to date. I ended up not bothering with the footnotes because it just didn't work well in the kindle app or on the kindle itself, however, even without them, I had the best time reading this book.<br /><br />Kinsella is a master at making plots like this one completely believable and real. Her characters are never too perfect, and always really well created. She writes with so much humor, she had me giggling or laughing throughout the book.<br /><br />It's one of those you won't be able to put down once you've started. :)
B00992CF6W|4.0|please...PLEASE let me have a friggin bucket!!!!!! Other than that just as good as the computer and xbox versions! I love this game and have been able to recreate some awesome single player creations I have.

B008673ZAQ|4.0|I really began to like Gideon and Eva more in this book. I can't wait for the third to come in December.
B003JTHWJQ|1.0|Right up front I will say I am pitching my less renowned rebuttles -- The God Choice - Parts 1 and 2. With that out of the way, I will join the 13.7% of \\"haters\\" and rebutt the 53.5% who \\"loved\\" this book. It is neither science nor theology, nor philosophy, nor reason. It is popular drivel. It is sad to see so many who find this amusing and even erudite. Sad that they have neither been exposed to nor taken the time and effort to really explore the subject. Dalkins has axes to grind -- personal axes. He misses out on so much of religion and so much of God and so much of philosophy, theology and meta-physics in his book due to following his own personal agenda -- rather than the facts (as any good scientist would). I would not be suprised at all to see Dawkins recanting at some point in the future. But even if it never occurred, it would not make the \\"God Delusion\\" any less trivial -- and as such delusional itself.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Riordan delivers!  Like all the Percy books, Kane Chronicles, and other Heroes of Olympus books, I could not put down The Mark of Athena once I started it.  Wonderfully paced, and I really enjoy the switching of narrators that he has done in the Heroes of Olympus stories.  My only problem is that the next book won't be released for a year!
0062127241|5.0|I loved this book. It was fascinating to read of his life and how he evolved into music and how the band evolved. He is very honest and forthcoming in details that aren't always flattering to him as a person, but who is perfect? He is just plain honest. A very unique perspective to the whole rock scene in London in the 60's and 70's. I've known for years that Pete was an accomplished musician. I had a friend from Pete's past, Nicky Hopkins (piano on \\"The Song Is Over\\" and \\"Gettin in Tune\\") . Nicky loved The Who because they could actually read music, in fact he couldn't remember any other band who could actually read music so he felt it was a joy to record with them. I was a kid when The Who first influenced my life, and I always wondered what it would be like to be \\"one of them\\". This is as close to that as I'll ever get. Thanks for sharing yourself with us Pete! You didn't have to, but I'm glad you did. It's been a joy and a pleasure.
030758836X|1.0|Preposterous plot and truly unlikeable characters. What a waste of my time.<br /><br />I read a book a week and have never been impelled to write a negative review.<br />Disliked this book so much I removed it from my Kindle.
1416972242|5.0|A Clockwork prince was based on jayme Alan Toomey. he's an author from Maine who got horrassed by the government.

In late december of 2011 he got charles bakley to ask Jesse jane out for him on the Jay Leno show. Charles barkley turned to the camera and said \\"Pirates\\" which is one of her movies. You should check out Jayme's website.
B007THA4FI|2.0|It was just a struggle to read. I kept hoping that there would be a point to the story but there didn't seem to be. JK Rowling writes well, no doubt about that but the characters in this book just seemed flat and uninteresting.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Well Written. Keeps you on the edge and very suspenseful. Even though it is written for teenagers, I am 43 and I really enjoyed it. I am a Katniss fan.
0345803485|1.0|Well I brought this book from the Kindle store as a holiday read since I wanted to see what all the hype was about it.<br />I must say that I shouldn't have wasted my money purchasing it even at under $10!!<br />The book started off ok and I thought maybe it will be an alright, but the further I read on the more terrible the book became.<br />As with most of the other reviews I was getting sick of the author's overuse of words. Not even half way through you could predict what was going to happen next...oh would Ana bite her lip, would her breath hitch, would she blush or flush or would her damn inner goddess come and say hello.<br />This book is pathetic and I feel that my IQ has dropped considerably after reading it!!
B008QE9XD2|5.0|The characters in Dark Shadows are based on real people from Maine. Jayme Alan Toomey, an author, is one of them. He got terrorized up there and the government stole his work and tried to keep him as a hostage. They passed out his work to all of Hollywood and his words can be seen in countless books, movies, and songs. A Clockwork Prince was based on him along with numerous other books and movies. The story is that he got chased across the country to CA where he is still being terrorized by the military and the police. He just got published this year. In late Decmber of 2011, he got Charles Barkley to ask Jesse Jane out for him on the Jay Leno show. Barkley mysteriously turned to the camera and said \\"Pirates,\\" which is one of her movies. Need I say more.
1476712042|5.0|This book was not what I expected. It was not as erotic as other books that I have read but much more romantic instead. I loved the story.  Most different and very compelling.  The characters were so well written and the evolvement of them was beautiful. The way Abby seduced Travis without even knowing she had done it was great and in the process she fought falling in love with him to no avail.  I can't wait to read his side of the story.  Well Done!
B00005JN2Z|5.0|Terrific product.  Everything handled great and arrived on time.  Everything was as it was advertised.  Glad to have one of my favorite movies at such an affordable price and with great extras!

B000M5AJQS|5.0|I guess they got some problems up there. This author Jayme Alan Toomey is supposed to be Leonardo Di'capriobut he thought they were all crazy, so he got chased across the country to CA where the police and military are still terrorizing him. I guess they stole his work and passed it out so they could have weight on him, so he'd have to be a rat. i heard they're all real people. I believe it. In late december of 2011, Jayme got Charles Barkley to ask Jesse Jane out on for him on the Jay Leno show. It's true. I saw it. I'd like to hear his explanation for that one. HBarkley mysteriously turned to the camera and said \\"Pirates\\" which is one of her movies. i think he should get a chance to go out with her.Look his name up on the internet.

I LOVE having that \\"problem!\\" with my kids...  LOL But seriously, he said that if you like the series at all, you will love this book. He didn't have any issues with it on his kindle and really wants Rick Riordan to move a little faster on the 4th book. (LOL)

B000NY12LO|4.0|Nineteen Minutes puts bullying under a microscope.  It's not just the story of a school shooting but a close look at the effects of bullying and points a finger clearly at those who, though do not participate in it yet they allow it to happen.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I like how this app works with my kindle fire.  This is<br />much better than the first couple of versions. I'm pleased.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I had never seen any of the first season except the last show. This year I saw the first show of the second season and I was hooked or more like obsessed. I bought the first season here, and watched it in record time. The actors are amazing! This is not what I normally watch. I like my shows honey coated. Not this series. This series seems too real, but love it.

0525953728|5.0|This book is one of the best books of its genre. It explains in detail what happened in the bin laden raid along with other missions that mark owen executed. I highly recommended for any reader, especially for military personnel.
B008LZHA3G|2.0|There are only three worth repeat songs on this CD---Scarlet Town , Tin AngelTempest.  Roll on John is a FAIL. Complete fail. No Rythmn no reason strange rhyme. Even Tempest is not an original song--it is an adaptation of an old Carter Family song from the 1920's. A lot of the other songs have the same blues structure he has used over and over. So little original melodies and some less than stellar lyrics.  The last CD Together Thru Life had only a few really good songs..most notably BEYOND HERE LIES NOTHING (great song).  Comparing Dylan to Dylan...this is a 2.5 Star CD..Worth a listen, a few repeat classics. Ultimately not great. Compared to todays useless pop--this is of course worth a listen. But Dylan doesn't top his homerun Cds--TIME OUT OF MIND, MODERN TIMES, LOVE AND THEFT (all 5 star Cds) of recent years. Bobs vocals are a bit better than Together Through Life--not sure if that is some studio trickery as his LIVE voice certainly not any better.doesn't have much voice left we all know...N Bob Stop borrowing Carter family and Muddy Waters hooks.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Excellent!! One of the best books I have read.  Loved all three books. Great writer. Would love to read more books by this author.
B0039UTDA6|1.0|One word: Oprah.  Do not buy this product unless you want to tear your hair out listening to a clueless woman who knows nothing of science narrate this piece.  David Attenborough was replaced because the executives think you are too stupid to appreciate his commentary and need to be talked down to.<br /><br />Don't reward them, boycott this product for the disgusting trash that it has become- purchase the real version instead.<br /><br />The actual videography and editing is superb, so its worth a buy if that's all you care about, but its just too aggravating listening to Oprah and thinking of what your missing.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|works great.<br />offers a new twist on the familiar jewels theme.<br />give it a try.<br />not too hard, not too easy.
B0086449YA|5.0|Knopfler is a master guitarist and composer. He delivers here a solid album full of depth, soul and melody. From the first track. KINGDOM OF GOLD you can hear the quality. A melancholy tune with a renaissance feel the album delivers. It is a soothing, smooth, layered CD. this is quality song writing. Not commercial pop. If you are looking for 1985 style \\"Dire Straits\\" thi is not the CD for you. This is more ethereal , subdued and poignant. Why this man is not in the rock and roll HOF is a joke.
B0091TGWYE|5.0|I've had this case for about 3-4 weeks and am just now able to use it due to Apple taking their sweet time with iPhone 5 shipments.

Not sure if I'll keep using it once more cases are available for the iPhone 5 but it's well made. The pull tab to help you release the iPhone5 out of the case is very clever and really the only part that I maybe... just maybe would be worried about breaking later on. Quality stitching. Quality material. What's not to like. Good work Snugg.
B004GJDQT8|3.0|I love my Amazon Mobile app. I just don't understand how Amazon can update this app with new fixes and features in the Google Play store but not on the Amazon App store. The only reason I install this app from the Amazon App store is because I have a Google Nexus 7 and the Amazon Mobile app in the Google Play store claims to be incompatible with my device. If this is true, why is it that I can install it fine from the Amazon App store and run it with no problems? Amazon needs to get their act together and not make things so difficult.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|This book was okay, I guess. I was expecting more of a plot with twists. I was slightly bored by the lack luster sex scenes between Christian and Ana.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I really enjoyed the concept and the easy writing style Collins has brought to the trilogy. The action is picked up at the end of the Hunger Games..no happily ever after for the two victors from District 12.  And, to top it off, the Panem President is seething over the humilation that Katniss supposedly pulled at the end of the novel Hunger Games. Catching Fire, the next book, keeps the action going and the pages flipping furiously to see what is going to happen. As a result, it is very hard not to read the last book of the trilogy, MockingJay. It was a very entertaining series to read.
B009157BWU|5.0|I was so drawn by the animal in this movie. Also how they live there lives and take care of each other. Also how they surive from difficult times when you thought it was going to end up bad for the baby chimpanzee thing turn out fine. It show that everything is not what it seem even among animal. Very touching and a eye opener. You will really enjoy this movie.
B0085TKAW6|3.0|I enjoyed this book immensely,I especially like the way the narative flowed from Fall of Giants (book 1) to this second book of the trilogy. I think readers will appreciate how the auther has the abilty to combine the historical facts and actual charactors to seemlessly merge with the fictional charactors.<br />The story is very entertaining and strong, as well as being historically factual and travels along at an exciting pace.<br />Good read and I await the final book in thes trilogy.<br /><br />Peter Owen
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Cool games!!! Keeps you coming back for more!!! My kids love it!!! Best game yet for free, can't beat free!!!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I had heard a lot about the book.  Not as bad as I expected.  Not a bad read. Definitely a book not for teens.
1423165691|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo3O6D31PMNXFQQ]]There's no better way to judge an artbook than by looking at its pages, so I thought the video would be useful to you.<br /><br />Everyone that knows about this book has been expecting it for years. I even thought it'd never come out. But here it is now in my hands, and I'm really happy with it.<br /><br />The book is all about the rough images drawn by Disney artists over for classics like Aladdin, The Little Mermaid, The Jungle Book, Peter Pan and so many others. There's very few sketches of the main characters for almost all big Disney animated movies, so there's something for everyone.<br /><br />The book has no text, except for an intro by Charles Solomon, where he mentions a few of the famous animators and what they drew. Then, it jumps directly to sketches and more sketches. There's no other text besides that introduction. While it's nice that the drawings are big so you can appreciate every detail, it's bad that there are no credits for each drawing. You're left wondering who the artist might be (although if you're a Disney animation freak, you might identify the style and quality of some of them).<br /><br />The book is similar in style to [[ASIN:1423117166 Animation (Walt Disney Animation Studios: The Archive Series)]], although the focus of this book is the rough drawings.<br /><br />I think that if you're a collector, or you like drawing, you're going to be really happy with this book. Enjoy!
B0011UBDTK|2.0|The Series Collection we bought is great...but the DVD's are not of a good quality.  It doesn't matter the player we use (DVD, Blu ray, Xbox, portable DVD, etc.), we can seldom watch the entire episode because it gets frozen and doesn't even let us take the DVD out of the player!!!  We are really disappointed.  We can't return it because shipping would be very expensive...so, we have to imagine the end of some episodes or read about it in the internet!!!  :( :( :(<br />Just wanted to let you know about this problem so a better care is taken about QUALITY.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I really enjoyed the 2nd book in the Crossfire series.  Really kept my attention.  Can't wait for book# 3.  I would write more, but would not want to give anything away. If you liked the first book, I would definitely recommend this one.
B0068FYZMK|5.0|This was a gift for my father for his birthday.  Babe is one of his favorite movies and this was the perfect gift for him!  The front flap opens and reveals details about the movie.  It is perfect for anyone who enjoys the movie and can appreciate a special edition.  I would definitely buy it again for anyone who loved the movie.  It was an easy buy and I wouldn't think twice about buying it again!  Great purchase!
B004X6PRO6|5.0|This is truly a novel that will become a classic because it was written as a cross-cultural author/novel. Truly a must read for all aspiring writers and lovers of good literature./dc
B0091THRCU|2.0|After a month waiting since ordering this product, it finally arrived. But it came with a huge disappointment because the stitches already broken and falling apart. I had to pay an additional $10 at a shoe repair place to have the breakages sewing back together! It is waste of money and my time. It was not even worth my time to call the vendor back and ship the product back, then getting a refund. If you have any alternatives, don't order this.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Saw the movie and was intrigued to read the book. The book did not disappoint and was a suspenseful and enjoyable read.
B003O86FMW|4.0|These books were fascinating- after I read the first one I couldn't stop! It seems as if Katniss is a real person. And I can just picture those muttations!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I have heard so much about this book that I finally decided to read it. I  couldn't put it down. I'm not starting the next book for a while because all I did was read this one. I need to catch up on housework now.
1619695006|1.0|Reading this book was like watching an endless episode of Survivor in which you see the degradation of humanity.  It was the British commoners at their worse or \\"white trash\\" hypocrites.  I wanted to scream at those self-absorbed characters that if they hate their friends and family, leave the situation or change your own attitude!  The class distinctions, racism, and sordid swearing at family and friends in front of them and behind their backs was disgusting. I am no prude.  I swear occasionally but this was over the top!  I found the whole read boring and full of blue language with \\"f_ _ _ in'\\" this and \\"f_ _ _ in'\\" that.  The audiobook gave me a whole new insight to the uppercrust sound of British English.  They can cleaverly put you down or in your place with the most debonair of accents and witticisms.
B000FC130E|2.0|Book was suggested for our book club.  Not my cup of tea.  Too many people and places.  Gets very confusing.
B004ZY0VHY|4.0|The author seemed a little stuffy to me with his sophisticated words nobody knows the meaning of.  The story was engaging but it was really wordy at times and I'd lose interest.  The ending really made you think.  I'll never forget Kevin.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|Loved this book! Read the first in the series, and can't wait for the next one to come out. It's fun to follow a couple through books like these. Love Sylvia Day novels!
030758836X|3.0|Just as I was getting bored with the story a very surprising twist gave it new life.  As clever as the book was the ending seemed like a cop-out as if the author couldn't imagine what happened next so he just left it unsettled.

B000007XUQ|5.0|I was raised with this album being one of the only albums my family ever played during the holidays. When I hear Karen's voice, I feel at home, safe and in the spirit of the season. NOTHING compares to this album (or Christmas Portrait). Even Karen, in interviews, stated that her favorite thing to sing about was Christmas. I adore this album and will forever adore it. Karen's voice is angelic and one-of-a-kind. Don't resist this album.
B005OTGS08|1.0|This is a boring, predictable and a piece of garbage-British-propaganda- movie. For those who like really serious and good WWII movies this would be a waste of time and money... Operation Grendel? Please!! Operation Poop would be more accurate.
0316228532|5.0|Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling's new adult book The Casual Vacancy is a brilliant and powerful novel that is incredibly difficult to read. Rowling proves in this book what a skillful writer she is. She is able to create characters so complex, so multi-faceted, that it's hard to remember they aren't real.<br /><br />Contrary to what the publisher promised in its promotional materials, The Casual Vacancy is not a \\"black comedy.\\" It is a grim, honest, realistic slice of life, populated by troubled, deep, and interesting people. There are a lot of important characters in The Casual Vacancy. It takes determination and patience to learn about each one and keep them straight.<br /><br />Despite the grim and depressing circumstances outlined for so many of the characters, I could feel myself drawn into the world of Pagford, the small town in England that serves as the book's setting. It didn't seem that different in many ways from the city in which I live. The themes are relevant to life in the United States as well as England. Some of the people of Pagford resent the people who live in a place referred to as the Fields. It lies between Pagford and the larger city of Yarvil. Yarvil pays for the provision of many services to the Fields, but Pagford bears part of the burden. To their dismay, this includes allowing children of the Fields to attend their school, which they feared \\"would be overrun and swamped by the offspring of scroungers, addicts, and mothers whose children had all been fathered by different men.\\"<br /><br />Some of the arguments are depressingly familiar. At one point two characters are discussing whether the addiction clinic does any good, and the subject turns to \\"principles.\\"<br /><br />\\"Yes, well, principles are sometimes the problem, if you ask me,\\" said Miles. \\"Often what's needed is a bit of common sense.\\"<br />\\"Which is the name people usually give to their prejudices,\\" rejoined Kat.<br /><br />Rowling has a great talent for making her readers carefor the characters she creates. In this novel, there is no main character. Instead, we are inside the heads of many people through a narrator. Rowling will introduce a character in such a way as to provoke a negative reaction, and then let us see the character's life from a different standpoint and stir up great sympathy. She first introduces a promiscuous, ignorant, and belligerent girl through the eyes of a teenaged boy and a school administrator; later we see the girl skipping school to clean up her filthy home in desperate hopes of persuading a social worker not to take her little brother from her addict mother. Another teenaged girl is being bullied, and at one point I was reluctant to read ahead because I was afraid the bully would not be the obvious candidate but another character, and I really did not want that other character to be a bully.<br /><br />The plot is relatively straightforward, but it moves steadily toward a terrific and terrible climax. Even though I wasn't able to predict what was coming, I felt a mounting sense of dread over the last fifth of the book.<br /><br />I am not easily moved to tears, but I cried at the end of The Casual Vacancy. I keep thinking about the events in the book and how they could have been changed for the better through action by some of the characters, and I marvel at how I feel real grief. I wonder how the characters are getting on; then I have to remind myself that they aren't real people. In the end, my sadness is not only for the unfortunate characters in the book but for the many real people whose lives are just as unfortunate. I'm guessing that was one of Rowling's objectives.<br /><br />I will not say that I enjoyed this complex and heartbreaking book. It's too grim and real. But I am very glad that I read it, and I highly recommend The Casual Vacancy to any reader who likes realistic fiction, exceptionally well-drawn characters, and excellent writing.
B00000016L|5.0|This is the best sounding CD of this album. It's my favourite album, and I've heard all the releases of it. I prefer the stereo mix - it was the first version I heard, on a mid 70's vinyl LP - and for me, the mono mixes are too short, and the sound is a bit harsh. The 60's vinyl pressing is great - turned up loud - but the warmth and clarity of the gold CD is something else. The regular remastered CD has excellent clarity -Tombstone Blues and Desolation Row sound awesome - but I'd choose the warmth of the gold CD over it if I had to.
159420411X|5.0|This was a remarkable tour through the history of predictions and forecasts. For somebody who uses this on a daily basis to make decisions, this book was incredibly thought-provoking on a variety of fronts: the distinctions between predictions and forecasts, why Bayesians won the argument over frequentists (everywhere except scientific papers, and the author does a great job demonstrating that it should apply even there), how to properly construct and measure accurate models, and why our information overload has led to worse predictions driving our decisions even as the information to make better ones is available.<br /><br />I agree with the critics who say he needs a better editor; there were a bunch of mis-spellings and whole sections where the author slips into soaring rhetoric rather than simple explanatory language should have been redone. But that only detracts a little - it's still a 5 star read for anybody who loves using data to foretell the future as accurately as possible.
B000LJB9U0|5.0|Brainstorm is at once a Science Fiction tour de force and a tribute to the talent,cinematic charisma,and charm of one of the greats of Hollywood. Douglas Trumbull's forward looking special effects and Chris Walken's quirky intensity set the stage. But this movie is about Natalie Wood. She is truly amazing.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|Continued nicely from the 1st but, I became frustrated with both Eva & Gideon's character.  To me, it seemed like each were trying to prove or retaliate the other - childish behavior.  However, we do learn the root cause to some issues.  The romance continues to be hot & heavy, each with an insatiable appetite.  Worth the read but, don't look for much substance.
B0072OFM28|4.0|Hey All, this might already be common knowledge, But while re-watching this season, It seems Ive found a Cameo by John Hannah,  in episode 8 at the 48:30 point, (at least in my version) it's when Spatacus is going to trade a wagon load of weapons for the Romans wife, after the trap is sprung and the arrows are flying it appears one of the Romans dispatched by Spartacus is John Hannah,  Do alittle freeze frame check it out let me know ????
B0031RAOW8|5.0|An excellent movie for all the family.  You need a box of tissues before this movie ends. I loved it.

B0091MW4QG|5.0|This is a sampler; it contains one selection each from most,, but not all, of the complete Verdi operas being released by C Major/Unitel Classica between now and next Spring. Since buying the entire series involves a substantial cash outlay over time, the disc gives the potential buyer a limited opportunity to evaluate performances because most excerpts feature one performer. On the plus side, disc quality in this series seems to be first rate, with all operas being made from an HD master, with very fine surround sound, and subtitles in \\"E, F, Sp, I, Chin, Kor, Jap\\". Some operas will be first time DVDs while others face varying levels of competition from existing discs.<br /><br />All operas are performed by the Teatro Regio di Parma, a tough venue for singers, since the Parmigiani are a very demanding bunch in the audience. Some performances are done in the Teatro Giuseppe Verdi in Busetto, a venue I like a lot since it seats only 300 and the stage is about 30 m deep. Orchestral work and choral work are first rate through the entire series. The performances are essentially \\"Italian\\" with an obvous respect for the music and a totally enthusiastic audience, even to the point of a \\"Viva Verdi!!\\"at the end of \\"Va pensiero\\". Oh yes; and some motivation for a Weight Watchers franchise in Parma.All of this makes for some splendid enjoyment at home!<br />i<br />I have received viewed and reviewed two of the first three (I already have a good Nabucco), Oberto and Il Giorno di Regno. The next three, Ernani, I Lombardi and I due Foscari have been ordered and I intend to review them after seeing them. All are very promising from the excerpts here. Below are some comments:<br /><br />Nabucco  --  Nucci, Theodossiou, Zanelatto. Moving \\"Va pensiero\\".<br /><br />I Lombardi  --  De Biasio, Pertusi, Theodossiou, Meli. Duet, \\"Come poteva un angelo\\", shows Meli doing very well.<br /><br />Ernani  -- Berti, Guelfi, Neves, Prestia.  Trio, \\"Tu se' Ernani\\" is energetic, and although I amnot a fan of Susan Neves, this is a must buy in order to get a decent Ernani.<br /><br />I due Foscari  --  Nucci, DeBiasio, Serjan, Tagliavini. Aria from last act shows Nucci in top form.<br /><br />Giovanna D'Arco  --  Bowers, Bruson, Vassilieva. \\"O fatidica foresta\\" shows Vassilieva in very good form, but Bruson's presence is a concern, since he is now past 70.<br /><br />Attila --  Parodi, Catana, Branchini, DeBiasio. Chorus and entry of Attila is very promising.<br /><br />Macbeth  --  Nucci,Valayre, Lori, Juliano. Faces very stiff competition from at least two existing discs. Nucci does very well both musically and dramatically in \\"fatal mia donna\\". Lady MacB is also the real deal both vocally and dramatically. Probable buy, since Macbeth was my first operatic experience.<br /><br />I Masnadieri  --  Neither cast info nor excerpt.<br /><br />Il Corsaro  --  Ribiero, Lungu, Salsi, Dalla Benetta. Dalla Benetta rocks in \\"Vola talor dal carcere\\".<br /><br />La Battaglia di Legnano  --  Neither cast info nor excerpt.<br /><br />Luisa Miller  --  Surian, Alvarez, Franci, Nucci.  Alvarez does a bang up \\"Quando le sere al placido\\".<br /><br />Stiffelio  --  Aronica, Guanqun, Frontalli.  No excerpt.<br /><br />Rigoletto  --  Demuro, Machaidze, Nucci, Iranyi. While there is a lot of competiton, overall quality of singing and staging make this must buy for your humble reviewer. Yowza! Quartet is excerpt and it rocks!<br /><br />Il Trovatore  --  Sgura, Romano, Nioradze, Alvarez.  \\"Di Quella pira\\" shows Alvarez in better form than in the recent Met release, but the Met version trumps.<br /><br />La Traviata  --  Vassileva, Giordano, Stoyanov. Who needs another Traviata? (ME!!) Stoyanov does a moving \\"Di provenza\\".<br /><br />I Vespri Siciliani  --  Nucci, Armiliato, Prestia, Dessi. A must buy for me. Dessi rocks in \\"Merche dillete amiche\\".<br /><br />Simon Boccanegra  --  Nucci, Scanduizzi, Plazzola, Iveri, Meli. Faces some stiff competition but from \\"Plebe! Patrizi\\", this looks like a winner.<br /><br />Un Ballo in Maschera  --  Meli, Stoyanov, Lewis, Fiorillo, Gamberoni. Meli in tenor aria is quite good.<br /><br />La Forza del destino  --  Theodossiou, Stoyanov, Machado, Pentcheva. Theodossiou does a ravishing \\"Pace, pace mio Dio\\" Promising.<br /><br />Aida  --  Pentcheva, Branchini, Fraccaro. Triumphal March is cool but hard to evaluate singers.<br /><br />No info, no excerpts on  Don Carlo, but faces huge competition from either Alagna or Villazon version.<br /><br />No info or excerpts from Otello.<br /><br />Falstaff  --  Maestri, Salsi, Vasselieva, Gandia. Finale looks promising but I am not a fan of Falstaff.<br /><br />So, gentle reader, that's the lineup. Watch pricing: Amazon offer excellent pre-release deal at $20.99 ( so far) but bumps to $35 as time passes. Early bird and all that.
B0074MZSWW|5.0|A combo of jazz, blues and a little rock with the sound of Jannice Joplin. The more I listened , the more I loved it.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I really enjoyed this book but I started to grow annoyed with the characters when yet again they couldn't stop freaking out and sabotaging their relationship. The last chapter or so was interesting, even if you figured out what's happened half way through the story.<br /><br />Overall this story was entertaining and worth the read, especially if you've read Bared To You. I'm interested to see where this story will go now.
B0058W74UY|5.0|i love this app. it plays my videoes so well. i will tell all my family and friends about this application. cant wait for the update
B000SEGCRS|4.0|I'm a novice photographer who recently decided I wanted to stop just pointing and shooting, and I learned a lot from Kelby's book. The very practical approach of the book really helped me stop being afraid of controlling the camera manually, and by experimenting with some of his suggestions, I feel much more comfortable playing around and taking some creative control. I would certainly recommend this book to someone who wants to get better but who feels mystified by the dials on their camera.<br /><br />A couple downsides I would note. I don't mean to shoot the messenger here, but a lot of Kelby's advice boils down to, \\"if you don't have a tripod, you can't get the shot.\\" For someone like me, who plans to do all shooting handheld, I would have loved to learn how to work more effectively with that limitation.<br /><br />I was also really surprised that this book does not cover more strategies for family photography. I got interested in photography because I have young children, and I want to create important memories. I can imagine that there are a LOT of people in my situation who would fit perfectly into Kelby's audience -- we aren't really camera-geek people, just people who want to take better pictures that reveal what's extraordinary about our ordinary lives, and the casual tone is very friendly and inspiring for us. But sometimes it seems that Kelby is really envisioning his primary audience as men with secret hopes of being the next Ansel Adams, not moms who are chasing toddlers around trying not to get their lens in the paint.<br /><br />So if you are one of those moms, I'd say that the book is worth reading, but you may have to look elsewhere for detailed strategies on family photojournalism.
0345803485|1.0|This is not literature.  It has almost no story and the character development is very poor.  The story is simple, sexually naive woman falls for sexual deviant with penchant for abusive, demeaning, mean sex. She thinks she can cure him, tries to rationalize his sickness but ultimately faces the facts. There could not be more than 2 paragraphs of trite predictable plot in this book.  The remaining 510 pages are explicit first person accounts of sexual assaults by a pervert on an inexperienced 22 year old woman.  If you want to learn about Sado-Masochism, bondage, and generally sick sexual appetites, there are plenty of books out there that do not masquerade as literature.  I kept thinking if I continued to read, it would ultimately have some redeeming value, but there is none.  The only reason people are buying this book is to \\"experience\\" the sex scenes -- and then they want company in their embarrassment so they \\"pass the book on\\" to someone else.  I will not be passing mine on, I threw it away (which I never do).  And I definitely will not be reading (or buying) the second and third books. \\"fool me once...\\"
B0091REZMW|5.0|This game is fun but I dont like how you have to use energy for it.  I do like the different rooms and different ways the objects are shown.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Fun to play. The price could be lower though. Still a great game though. Premium is way better than the free version.

B000SEGUDE|2.0|If you're thinking about buying this book, I assume you will read other reviews or summaries for info concerning the structure and stories that make up Cloud Atlas. Recapping the whole thing would be almost as tedious as reading the novel.<br /><br />As intriguing a notion as the concept of linking stories through time and space may be, Cloud Atlas failed to provide stories and characters that were worth spending time with. Each individual's story seemed -- there. My personal response to the characters can best be summarized by my exclamation when I got to the place where one character explains how he has arranged his suicide. \\"Thank goodness. Will the next story be any better?\\"<br /><br />Cloud Atlas is one of those books you can borrow from your local library. If you love it, then buy it.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|A movie that gives chills. Looking forward to the sequel.  Suspense, terror, special effects.  Saw the film in the theatre and just purchased the 4 disc set.
B00001ODGR|4.0|Well I finally bought this DVD. Been a Styx fan since Cornerstone. This DVD was released in 1999, in the early days of DVD's and it shows. It does have a 5.1 audio mix, but the center speaker is empty, it sounds tin-canish but is acceptable. The picture quality look like it was taken from a VHS tape, but it was filmed very good and had nice editing. Good song list, good energetic concert. Some good bonus features too, a Tommy Shaw interview, photo slide show of the tour as a a camcorder video-log of the tour. Still a Must own for a Styx fan. It is much better than the 1984 \\"Caught in the Act\\" DVD.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Catching Fire develops the characters and the story. The plot moves along quickly with lots of surprises. When you get to the end, you should have Mockingjay ready because you'll want to find out what happens next.[[ASIN:0439023491 Catching Fire (The Hunger Games, Book 2)]]
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I enjoyed the first book so much, thought #2 would never come out.  I did have some trouble trying to keep the families straight.  Since the main characters had grown older and the younger family members were in the forefront, I had to do some back and forth to keep people straight time to time.  I think Follett weaves an exciting story, and his characters seem real to me.  Keep the family tree outline handy...for sure.
B006YTTVHO|4.0|Great quick tips on approach.  i'm shy and will review again when not feeling confident.  i will definitely recommend this book.
B004ZZS4CC|3.0|The book was an easy read about Jaycee Dugard and her abduction.. I think she did a good job writing her account of her terrible 18 years of captivity.
B007L6VR6M|5.0|I heard all the hype about this movie, but never actually saw it in theaters.  So, when I purchased the Blu-ray and first watched it, I was thrilled.  I am a huge Wes Anderson fan, and this film really delivers.  It has all the magic I have come to know from the director, but also creates a world that anyone would love to inhabit.<br /><br />Overall, I would highly recommend this movie and hope you cuddle up to your love with a big bucket of popcorn while watching.
B008VVT51U|5.0|What a charming and unexpected movie.  It was a brilliant piece of casting as well.  My Mom and I have watched it several times and it never disappoints.
B005LAIHXQ|2.0|Can somebody please tell me just what in the World this crap was about? Way too complicated<br />for its own good. Utterly devoid of any of the suspense of the original Alien. As far as I can<br />see NO questions were answered about who the \\"Engineers\\" were. Why they created US. Why they then<br />decided to destroy us. Why that Engineer at the beginning was committing suicide? What the hell<br />that squid-like thing was supposed to be inside Noomi? Why David put that Alien substance into the<br />scientists drink? A confusing and highly disappointing mess in my opinion. Thank God I didnt see<br />this at the cinema. Boy I would have been pissed.

B0063IH60K|5.0|This works very well. Yes there are ads but what do you expect for free? I assume that's how the developers make their money.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Easy to play fun too.  Keep those power ups kids you'll need them for sure.  Nice graphics with fun levels.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved  this book! I cant wait to read the others. the author knows just how to get you roped in!
1423140605|4.0|The seven demigods, a mixture of both Greek and Roman, of prophecy are together aboard the magical Argo II and are heading to the ancient lands to defeat the giants. What they don't know is that Gaea will use what ever forces and monsters she can to stop them before reaching the ancient lands. Will the seven learn to work together and use their powers as a team or will their individual powers cause the entire quest to fail?<br /><br />The third book in the Heroes of Olympus series doesn't disappoint. The book's told in the point of view of four different demigods. What I loved of course was the reunion between Percy and Annabeth. But there were other moments that I loved as well. Watching the demigods realize that working together, they are stronger than on their own because the strengths of one compliment the weaknesses in another. That and they're way more powerful when they work together. The cliffhanger at the end of the book has me eagerly awaiting the 4th book due out next fall.<br /><br />I read this book for pure pleasure. My thoughts and opinions are my own.<br /><br />Recommend to fans of Harry Potter, Nicholas Flamel, young adults, Percy Jackson, and those who love Greek/Roman mythology.<br /><br />Rating - 4 stars
B004M9AS3Y|4.0|This is a nice bag when you wish to carry your DSLR around together a laptop/tabled and some other non-photographic items. But despite what Lowepro says, it won't hold a laptop larger than 15\\". For example, nor my Dell Latitude E6520 (15.6\\") nor an older Precision M4400 (15.4\\") will fit the notebook compartment, which makes it not useful when I need to travel with a larger notebook.<br />The pocket inside the front compartment are a bit small too, and probably will be a tight fit for most actual smartphones. Had Lowepro designed it a inch larger and an inch taller it would have been almost perfect.<br />Yet the side aperture is very handy to get the camera and shoot keeping the backpack on a shoulder, and there is enough room for what you may need to carry with you an a short trip, especially when flying and having to carry just one cabin luggage - both camera and notebook are protected enough and easily accessible.
B007MJT13E|2.0|Not that understanding because it's all in foreign language. Subtitle s are moving by to fast, also not a whole lot of action.
B0014VQGX4|4.0|Bruder make a great line of construction toys, my 2 year old also has the Dump truck, the crane, and the excavator. needless to say that both my kids enjoy it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Love this calculator. nice big display. simple and easy to use and because its on my Kindle Fire L always have it near.

6305428352|5.0|I love this movie and I think it's a shame that all we have is a bare-bones DVD edition. If anyone from the studio reads this please release a deluxe edition on Blu Ray and DVD.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I have never played this type of game before and I have to say its pretty darn good! This version is extremely well done. try it out!
0345404475|5.0|Three things scare me more than anything in the world: Zombies, alien invasions, and artificial intelligence. This book did nothing but make the fear of AI worse.<br /><br />Every time I read one of the science-fiction novels that tends to be super well known, I am ALWAYS surprised by how much they strike me. This isn't just a story with some scientific elements thrown in, this is a book that asks some SERIOUS questions about how the world will be run in the future.<br /><br />The thing that lies at the heart of the book is one simple question-what is morality? The ability to empathize? Or rationalize? Compassion for all things living, or compassion for intelligent beings? The entire book is just the reader going back and forth between these questions, not being to decide who to sympathize with and who to villainize. In my opinion that's the best part of the book, is that there is no protagonist and antagonist, everyone can be both.<br /><br />Also a lot of subtle reference to mental illness, and the effect that it can have on a person. Within that is the question of religion, and whether or not religion is based on any historical foundations or is just a complete farce that happens to make us feel better, more purposeful.<br /><br />Basically if you like science-fiction you should read this book. I mean they based the movie Blade Runner off of it, which I haven't seen but that will be remedied soon enough.
B00395ZYVS|5.0|I loved almost every part of this book. The part about life in India was the more interesting bit. It gave me an insight into a world I knew very little of. This can easily be a true story and made me think of how blessed I am being born to who and where I am.  There's parts I cried my eyes out for the way our world is shaped..... I would recommend this to anyone.
B008GVD6D8|3.0|My first thoughts were 'not as good as the first book' (Bared to You) but it got better. Eva comes across as flakey at times but one can't expect great literature in books churned out as fast as these. However the story is progressing and I will see this soap opera through to the 3rd and last book for closure for these 2 intense, but likeable characters.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it is fun but it has some games that take a long time to bet and it makes me mad.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|thank you for lots of fun. I use this at work to get away from the craziness. love that I got it free.
0553062182|5.0|Transforming one's self identity can be life changing, and that is what this book did for me. For decades my temperament and feelings were labeled as negative or even as a disease or illness.  Instead I now understand that I am highly sensitive and that to be highly sensitive is a gift though it can be a hard one if you have had many adverse experiences in childhood.  I cannot recommend this book highly enough for anyone who thinks they might be highly sensitive.
B009CGYO0K|3.0|The book was entertaining and would have been great if the profanity and vulgar language  had been omitted. I would not recommend it to my family to read.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I picked this up as a free app of the day, and was glad I did. the game play is fresh and challenging. game mechanics are smooth. I liked everything about it. even the music was good
B008673ZAQ|3.0|Over the top in the sexual story but little else of substance. The wealth of the male protagonist was interesting for an onlooker with not much in the bank
B007GCY8FS|2.0|I have read all of the Reacher novels and this was very disappointing. Most of the details Reacher cites were fillers to make the novel the required length.
B008G8SFGO|4.0|i have to say that this is the best kiss album done entirely by kiss they didn't do anything new and they didnt cross to the next level of creativity the only next level is the marketing creativity which no other band can even come near what they have already reached \m/ this album contain the best guitar playing and the lyrics they are all cool and top notch and i like it that they had tagged this cd by saying this is a rock n roll cd with no fillers or ballads \m/ buy this and enjoy rock n roll the way it should always sound and make you feel
0486275590|5.0|I am in my mid-thirties and just read this book for the first time.  I enjoy reading the classics and just made my way to this one, which I am very glad I did.  The book is a fast-paced, lean adventure story with all the expected elements of a great pirate yarn.  The only thing it is missing is a dramatic walking-off-the-plank scene.  Some of the jargon is outdated and can be hard to understand, but it is not impossible to get through. Minor Spoiler Alert for people who haven't read the book - don't read the rest of this review!  Long John Silver is a terrific character, a more sinister version of the modern-day Capt Jack Sparrow.  He is an interesting repository of moral ambiguity in a book otherwise populated by characters that fall clearly on the side of good or evil.  I also really enjoyed how the regimented moral uprightness of Captain Smollett serves as a foil for Long John Silver.  He is not such a fabled character, but he is an almost equal force in the novel and has the respect of all parties, even Silver himself. It was hard to believe he would ever consent to go on the cruise, since he seemed to smell a rat from the very beginning. Jim Hawkins, the main POV character, tells the story of his adventure with charming impulsive boyishness.  A great read and a great story that still holds up today!
B008XG1X18|4.0|A slightly different format from the full site, but overall easy to adjust to and use. Be warned, it does crash occasionally, but usually recovers quickly.
014241543X|3.0|This book had mis-spelt words all over!<br />It was annoying in the least. The story of how her and her best friend (Kim) became friends was annoying. The fact that the author tries to make Mia and Adam seem like their so mature is annoying. I just didn't like this book.<br />It's nothing like Twilight. The book is not intense, I had to force myself to finish it.<br />Shitty book, 3 stars for the great idea.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|I can't remember enjoying a book as much as this one in a long time. It was so improbable and fun and great. I loved the old fashioned language and how everything turned out for the best. It was a hoot! It was a book a really enjoyed taking my time with. I loved it.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|If you like Shades of Gray, you will like this series.  The third book pending but I loved the first two and have already pre-ordered book three.  I find it a little frustrating to have to wait for the next book.  You might want to await the completion and then start the series.
B000SCHBGQ|4.0|The only problem I have so far is Josh's whining. So annoying. He seems more like a spoiled 12 yr old than a 16yr old. Otherwise an enjoyable read so far. Let's hope it gets better and Josh grows a set and stops being a self-centered baby.
B008M36ER0|3.0|Good Mel action flick. A little slow in the middle and a little unbelievable as far as some of the stunts.  But it wasn't the worst action movie I've seen this year.<br /><br />Worth the rental.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Hard to put down . Raises questions in your mind . would you ? could you ? OMG !! I might ! Read this book , only if you have an open mind about sex .
B0000027RL|5.0|What happen to music of today?  Pearl Jam produced some awesome jams that I still listen to!  If you like good rock music, this is a great album.  I like every song on this CD.  If artist need to know what a good band should do, they oughta product 10 hit songs instead of making various CDs with 1 hit and a lot of misses.  Well. I guess that's the trend of 2000 and now: keep on rehasing CDs and add maybe a new single or two every few months.  Ten by Pearl Jam reminds me of what good music is in the 90s.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am a school librarian and this app allows me to find ideas quickly and share them with those who need them.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Ok, for everyone who has wrote about how bad this book is I have to say I disagree! Some of the stuff that Ana and Christain does/says is annoying I agree, but it is a really great love story. I really think some of the people who read this just dont have an imagination, a book doesnt have to correct in every way to be a great book.  I wasnt reading it because it was correct in everyway, or the sex (which I did skip over some of it because it does become a little repetative). I read it because it was a great love story.  The book touched me, (because apparently I have an imagination) it made me cry and laugh when the characters did . I LOVED IT. I give this 5 stars, I would give it 10 if I could. Great author, would read her books any day! (I have read the Fifty Shades of Grey Trilogy twice already and cant wait to read it again!)
1476712042|5.0|Very insightful, light but intense at the same time.  Reads quickly and takes you right back to college.  Great for a rainy weekend in front of a fire!  definitley recommend this author and was disappointed she had not yet written any similar books.  Can't wait for her next work.
B0080YGZ20|5.0|What Can I say, I literally just left from seeing her Live here in Minneapolis and as good as this album is, hearing her live, seeing her passion, her dances, hearing that voice, the clear beauty of talent. . it's amazing. She gave a jaw-dropping performance. She moves like no one is watching her, she sings like it's the last time she will ever sing again. . .<br /><br />My fav songs are \\"Something In The Way You Are\\"- This is just sexy, soulful, and everything else. It's got an R&B feel to it and it reaches deep as she sings.<br /><br />Settle Down, Cameo Lover, Plain Gold Ring, The Build Up, Posse, Home. . .hell the whole album. Seriously she's a force. . .just go for it, you won't regret it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book is very well written, full of suspense and has great twists throughout.  It is a quick read, but a good one.  I couldn't put it down. Loved it.
B004TN7QPG|5.0|I was getting a little tired of having to have a have dozen app's for all my mobi, epub's, pdf's, etc. Then I happened to come across moon reader today. This was almost as good as the day I received my fire. This little app does everything I wanted and stuff I didn't even know I needed. It may be almost a $5.00 app but add up a couple reading apps you paid for and this is a bargain.<br /><br />I almost forgot to add that moon also handles comics in a few formats.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game its the best its a lot of fun and it never gets old because there's not only one game
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|It is great.  Have enjoyed the whole series.  I wasn't ready for it to end.  Can't wait for book 4 to come out... Defiantly a great book
B00884GR0W|5.0|awesome but I cant find birchwood?!? can anyone please leave birchwood world seeds?thx!!!!!!!!!!!!! oh yeah the nether is past the place with all of the lamps and forgotten stone.
B00899EOIS|5.0|As an adult viewer this series is my secret obsession. It is a combination of  \\" twin Peaks\\"  \\" Friends\\"  and Nancy Drew. Great Hair and clothes.
B008K5T5AI|4.0|This is a book about the ideal socialist utopia, as discussed by endless committees of giant well-meaning ships. As I read it, the sublime can be interpreted as the ideal world - each according to their means etc ... - devoted to pure rational thought. In the sublime, the material no longer matters.<br /><br />Driving the story is the issue of revolution  - the moments before the sublime is achieved. Here the threat of anarchy is ever present, and it requires a committee of minds to try and keep things on track.<br /><br />Part of the problem with this book is that it really does represent the kind of interminably dull council meetings from the 1970s where various interested members discuss buildings and traffic control - except on a universal scale. Another part of the problem is that there is little at stake. Since we, and no one, really knows what the sublime is actually like, a countdown to sublimation is not exactly thrilling. Banks does throw in the suggestion that the sublime may not be everything it is cracked up to be, but this is not enough to prevent the slow drag of boredom that permeates the story.<br /><br />On the other hand though, it is structured somewhat like a sonata, and the Scherzo passages, where Banks lets loose on the violence and mayhem, really stand out as bravura set pieces. This is an old man's book in a good way - it has the wisdom of mortality underpinning the rest - and perhaps the slow pace is even a part of this - but the founding theme of the work remains strong.<br /><br />Even a bad Banks is a good book.
B0090EHVMC|1.0|This movie was a snoozer. My son is 2. He was bored and so was I. Keep politics out of kids movies
B008K6HN8I|5.0|This program is super!  I've tried a couple of different file browser apps and this one seems to do things a bit better than the rest.  It supports browsing and managing files on remote machines and streaming the files to an audio or video player so you don't have to download the file to listen or watch it.  I used to have a seperate app for bluetooth, ftp, etc but this program does it all.  I've also been using this app to connect to my cloud storage on amazon s3.  I highly recommend you give this app a try!
B006OOHYIC|4.0|This game is well done, I just wish it added a few more new twists. There are certainly some new things, just fewer than I'd hoped.<br /><br />If you liked the original then you will like this one too.
0007466064|3.0|It took me 3 weeks to read the first 4 books. After beginning book 5 I got through halfway and just had to stop.  It may be that I am on overkill and rather frustrated with the deaths of some of my favorite characters.  It may also be that there seems to be no end in sight for the whole saga.  I will come back to it in a month or two and see how it goes.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love it! allows a challenge but the game isn't impossible I love it and its very easy to understand! it is very easy to get coins to get the next game you play and is a very good hams for passing time!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this is the best calculator app I have ever used it is so easy to use I live it thanks
B004POVBRS|5.0|Don't let the 1 star review fool you about this episode, it is actually far unimportant. It may not be filled with explosions or weird science related deaths but it is an integral part of what happens in the future. You could even say this episode explains the catalyst of what unfolds in the future; you will engage in a flashback that reveals answers to a few lingering questions:<br /><br />How did Walternate even know his son was in the alternate universe?<br />If you recall, his research was not the same as the main Walter's, this was revealed when he didn't even know what Cortexephan was when Olivia made it to the alternate universe.<br /><br />Why was main Walter so set on achieving success with the Cortexephan subjects?<br />Although we are told that ZFT is the main reason for creating 'soldiers' for a future crisis, we are left in the dark as to why moving through universes was such an integral part of the experiment.<br /><br />Why did main Walter keep Peter for as long as he did?<br />If curing him was the main reason for his involvement, and the lie eventually killed his wife in the future, why did Walter keep Peter? Despite missing his son, as a scientist he knew his real son was gone.<br /><br />Why is Olivia so important? Out of all the subjects in the experiment, why was Olivia singled out as a multi-ability success?<br />This episode essentially reveals just how special Olivia is and why her relationship with Peter is much more than just a romantic sub-plot in the series.<br /><br />Overall this is a somewhat emotional episode that ties up loose ends that otherwise are left in the air.
B001GXF2YY|5.0|I have loved every book in this series and this one is no exception.  Would highly recommend looking into audible.com too.  Unfortunately this is the only book not available through audible which is why I got the kindle version.
034580404X|3.0|I was disappointed.  Christian started to get a little to mushy for me.  Some parts were dragged out.  The first book was probably the best book.  Try reading J R Ward Brotherhood books.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I, like so many others, was extremely intrigued about what JK Rowling wrote about in her newest novel.<br />I found this book not worth the time it took to read it, however. I have never taken so long reading one book. I will say that her descriptions and details were fantastically described, but it gave me whip lash. Back and forth, up and down and every which way.<br />It made me think of Stephanie Meyer's \\"The Host.\\" A flop.<br />I hate to say it, but this one is going into my Hastings trade in pile.
B0086449YA|5.0|Mark Knopfler is getting better and better as the time goes by and this album is a living proof. Just one word could define this master piece: EXCELSIOR.
B007THA4FI|4.0|I had heard a friend complain that this book was long, boring and depressing but I totally disagreed, I loved it!  It is not a fast-paced read, and it is not action-packed, but that's not what it's supposed to be.  It is a glimpse of a village in Britain which is small enough so that just about everyone knows just about everyone, or is connected in some way, and everyone gossips about everyone else, and everyone has an opinion (and feels superior to the opinions of others).  I also loved the separate worlds of the parents and the children, sort of like an upstairs-downstairs juxtaposition - the worlds are inextricable, but totally different.<br />I never thought I would ever consider reading Harry Potter, but I so enjoyed Rowling's writing that I might have to give one a shot!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I love every word. Of course it is a warbook, again, but the great part of is the writing about all this families and what they experience about this century.
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|I liked the paper back so well, I wanted it permanently on my Kindle. Having ready access with searching power is a good thing, in my opinion.
B0091REZMW|5.0|AWESOME!!! Mystery Manor is so full  of things to find! I love all of it!! ita awesome because it gives you so many things to find! I love it.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I was not impressed by this book. As an avid reader, I found it to be poorly written and with a light story line. It is neither sexy nor romantic nor shocking. It is, simply put, a mediocre novel.
B000I9YLUI|5.0|One of the best love stories ever! The characters were perfect; believable!  The cinematography and soundtrack is mesmorizing.  This is the type of movie I love to watch repeatedly and thanks to Amazon I WILL BE!
B002SF9YNO|5.0|I originally viewed this movie as extra credit for a class. It was shown at a local theater with an open discussion following.  Wasn't expecting to love this movie but I was so pleased that I had to purchase it for my own pleasure.  If you don't like subtitles this may not be the movie for you, but it you're not opposed to the subtitles I would recommend this movie.  The discussion after the movie gave me a greater understanding of the subject matter.  Turns out that the occupation of the title character is held in the lowest regards which helps you to understand the actions of the other characters.
B004SBX112|1.0|.99 for nothing it never down loaded onto my kindle fire first time I have ever had a problem. Do not understand why it did not download, very disappointed.
B00991TCOG|5.0|I discovered Lindsey like most others, through her YouTube videos. I have a friend to thank for that, since he told me to check her music out. Now enter her first CD release. All of the tracks are awesome, with my favorite being Song of the Caged Bird. Her mix of beautiful violin melodies with electronica, beats, and even dubstep are extremely catchy, original, and have to be heard. She is an artist on the brink of superstardom, and I'm proud to be one of her early adopters that got in at the beginning. This is nowhere near my usual taste in music, as I usually listen to rock and metal, but I do have an ear for talent in other genres, and Lindsey is just that, raw talent, and an extremely gifted musician.<br /><br />Like others have said that also purchased this through Amazon, I too received this with damage to the case, but the CD itself was fine. Unlike them, I REFUSE to downgrade my review for a damaged case. Her music is not affected by a damaged case, and this review is for that, NOT the case or packaging.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This was a great book in the series. I can't wait till book 3 comes out. Love the mistery and romance of the characters.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Get this game. Nice graphics. Decent story. Great Gameplay. Good music.<br />Worth the money. Easy at first but becomes quite challenging as you progress.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is a relaxing, feel-good game. I can take it to work and play at lunch, shut it down and never lose where I left off.
B0054EZ6I8|5.0|I love the continuity of this series. One thing leads to another. This show is pivotal for the biggest plot item of the series. Loving it.
B0056CUZRA|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this story, characters were real and the story built quickly and engaged the reader. Loved the historical war setting and the fact that history was interwoven into the story. Have read the next book in this trigligy and it is just as good. A gripping, quality read!
B008XG1X18|4.0|pinterest is addicting enough this app amplified it. works well for what it is. easy to get around the site. I use it on my tablet and use it all the time. freezes from time to time but eh, no big deal.

0385344333|2.0|These pathetic words from Sorenson at the start of Chapter 38, no less. She's known Reacher for 172 pages - knows he's not guilty, knows he's a decorated military hero and, by this time, knows the circumstances and timing of the crime.  So, I almost threw the book out the window.  I, too, like many other reviewers have read all 17 of Lee Child's \\"Jack Reacher\\" books and, wouldn't be here writing if he weren't a huge role-model hero.  But I finished the book anyway - despite being disappointed in the overall lack of \\"Reacher class\\" - I usually learn a lot, about things I've never even thought about, as Child's takes us thru Reacher's process of elimination assessment of a situation<br />but not so much in this book.  I recommend Jack Reacher books all the time - so if you're thinking of picking-up one, try one of Child's earlier Reacher books.  I didn't read all 17 books in published order.<br />OK, I read A wanted Man and basically, the story is weak, yet I still enjoyed spending time with Reacher.  SO, on \\"About The Author\\" page - I'm reminded that Lee Child's has allowed Hollywood to produce the Reacher book \\"One Shot\\" into a film starring -  5\\"1\\" - 129#'s dripping wet, pip-squeak, Tom Cruise.  When I first heard this, some months ago, what a disappointment that an author would allow a total disgrace and denigration of, what readers call, a much needed in today's world real hero.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Love it, spend an hour or two on it before bed. Very hard to put down. If you like jewels then you will like this game.
B0072OFM28|5.0|Love it! I don't get the show on my Tv so I usually end up buying them. Never disappointed! It arrived promptly and in great condition! Freakin awesome show.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|I ordered this sonic screwdriver to accompany a Rose Tyler Halloween costume on a Saturday evening, and got the package on a Wednesday morning -- excellent shipping! I'm very pleased with the product, too. It is made of plastic, as many reviewers before me have said, but I haven't had any of the breaking problems that others seems to have found. For the most part, my screwdriver has seemed very durable, and I cannot complain about either the UV light or the sounds. The ink pen works great, too! This will be a great addition to my costume this Halloween.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book was wonderful...  I can't wait to see what's going to happen to Eva and Gideon.  I am definitely in love with Gideon and think he and Eva are so good for each other.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|I read this as a twelve year old because the movie recently came out and the sample was good. however as I got farther into the book there were details about sex and other things that I had not covered in health class yet. other than that the book was touching and interesting. I would recommend this for people that are older than twelve and are more comfortable with some topics covered in the book.
B008XG1X18|1.0|This would be getting a higher rating if it would freaking open! The app forces close and will not open. Please fix.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Can't wait til December to read Entwined with you, This story is so much better than Fifty Shades of Grey I can honesty say that I've read both.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Wow, he can tell a story. After reading book one I am so glad that book two was ready and waiting for me so I could continue the saga. I laughed, cried and worried... What a wonderful way to escape into another era with people I so wished I knew.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Loved this book and can't wait for the next.  This book was better than the first and really paints a good picture of the trauma that both characters have been through.  Upset that I have to wait so long!!!
B008E374PO|5.0|Love the cd! Adam Young never fails to impress me :)<br />This new album makes me so happy!! :D So glad I bought it ~

B008673ZAQ|3.0|I've read both this series and Fifty Shades series and this one I found disappointing comparatively. It lacked the excitement and  interest of Fifty Shades. Also I found Gideon had no softness to his character whereas Christian had more facets to his. Gideon's character was ugly. Christian more human.
0316212377|5.0|I've just finished The Hydrogen Sonata, Iain Banks' latest Culture book. I loved it.<br /><br />It would be hard to say which Culture books are the very best (Player of Games and Use of Weapons are up there for me, and Surface Detail), but The Hydrogen Sonata certainly is in the *type* I like the most: entertaining, lots of fancy far-future super-tech stuff, Sentient, powerful Culture megaships and drones, and so on. Riveting stuff.<br /><br />Iain Banks has said that the Culture is the *best* society he could imagine, while still being believably human. And that this was what is driving the whole concept and the books. And that he'd love to live there. Me too! Technological wonders everywhere, and all the basic human problems solved. (If one finds this boring, one could just take a ship to a nearby less civilized empire, where one could risk being shot down in the street, if that makes life more precious to one.)<br /><br />Even just one aspect seen alone makes Banks special to me: his subtle, underlying sense of humor. I think few people would call his books comedies, but the humor is everywhere: in the names the spaceships give themselves (\\"Of Course I Still Love You\\", Anything Legal Considered\\", Just the Washing Instructions Chip In Life's Rich Tapestry\\"...), in the shapes he gives aliens, in the personalities he gives everybody, not the least the AIs, etc etc. Humor makes life worth living.<br /><br />Update:<br />I have to admit this is not so easy to read, because of all the invented names and invented technology and politics. I had to use an ebook as support when I didn't get what the audiobook was saying. (I'm not sure if it's more so in this book than his others.)
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Epic 4g, Cyanogenmod 7.2 RC0.  Match 3 tiles in a row, but get certain objects on the play field to the bottom as well to work on an overall quest.  Great graphics, music and enjoyable game play for a puzzle game.  The only downside is that the ending is non-existent when you complete the last level and then you just start over again and the game gets slightly more difficult by adding in indestructible boulders to most of the levels, but the game difficulty never got much beyond medium-level even with the boulders added as I finished the game a second time and nothing changes starting on the third attempt-you just keep building up your score to infinity and not much else.
0375413405|5.0|My husband is delighted that I have brought Julia Child's cooking into our home.  For me it has made cooking fun.  I have never tended to a roasting chicken like  she explained, and it did make a juicy, tender difference.  I became interested in Julia while visiting our daughter in Reno, NV this summer after reading her book about Julia's letters written between Julia and Avis DeVoto from about 1952 to about 1965.  These letters were about the publishing of  ;Mastering' and the testing and choosing of the recipes.  Fascinating.  So we are happier but a little bit heavier.
0525958002|5.0|In this autobiography, I feel that John does his best to help paint a picture of his life. I felt that he went into great detail about his childhood. I felt like I could picture his homelife growing up. He also was very detailed with the creation of the band. I loved hearing about the Rum Runner and the early days of the band with the ever changing line up of members.<br /><br />Once Duran Duran become huge, I feel that John goes into some details, but not as much. The sex, drugs and rock and roll mantra are present, but not to a great degree. He does talk about his addiction later. He is very introspective about his feelings of loneliness. I think that he was very honest about his feelings in some regard, especially in dealing with his relationship to Renee Simonsen. BUT then, he rushes into a relationship with Amanda De Cadenet and ends up marrying her because she is pregnant with his child. I felt that there was not a lot of feeling or emotion. Would have liked to know more. He never really talks about his daughter either. He mentions her but not like he spoke about his parents.<br /><br />By the 1990's up to the reunion, there is not a whole lot there. He does speak about his addiction and going to rehab, but I would have liked to know more. He had his own B5 studios in the 1990's and did a few solo albums,movies and tours, but none of that is mentioned. He does mention the Neurotic Outsiders side band he played with but that is it. I would have liked to know about his acting.<br /><br />I love Mr. Taylor. I gave the book 5 stars because overall it achieved its objective which was to tell his overall life story. The photographs were wonderful.I enjoyed them thoroughly. He can always write another book. I will buy it as well, but I am waiting for Nick, Simon and Roger to write their story.<br /><br />This book is for the Duran Duran fan. There is not a lot of info on other bands that a rock fan might want for referencing.
1400052181|5.0|I have a loved one who will be going through immunotherapy soon. Reading about the advances in medicine just since the 50s really makes it easier for me to know that God has a hand in this. How exciting it would be to know HeLa cells were used in the development of these vaccines.<br /><br />I know it was hard for the family and I know that she suffered. That can't be forgotten. But I also know that great good came from all of that. This book is a must read for anyone going through a medical crises and any one remotly aware of someone going through a medical crises.

She exhibits so much substance and purpose in her lyrics and melodic rhythm to keep you fellin' her whole vibe. She definately has a message in her music and passionate about her decision to deliver.  Extremely soulful and lively, superbly strong vocals on songs like,Big White Room, OMG, scattin, truth and honesty.  Best new music in the decade.
B009GX7O56|5.0|considering the FACT that my family and i [4 people] are HUGE DIE-HARD FANS of the greatest show on television today and have been for 10 seasons now cannot say enough as to how we love what we call GIBBS AND COMPANY.the premier episode of the 10th season was as expected TERRIFIC.to answer the the question what i would have wanted to know before purchasing the product.NOTHING.we are such huge fans of the show along with it's spin-off NCIS LA.that we watch both diligently every Tuesday night without fail and then purchase the dvd's of both shows when they are released.in closing instead of having to give 5 stars we would not hesitate to give GIBBS AND COMPANY 100 OR MORE STARS for each and every episode from the first ever episode of the show till now.including the 2 part JAG episodes introducing us to GIBBS AND COMPANY.one of Gibb's rules should be watch the show weekly or expect to get slapped on the back of the head like Anthony DiNozzo gets it from THE BOSS every so often.sincerly rickfan.

B0052RDHTM|5.0|I greatly enjoyed this book. I loved the characters and the details of their lives that are the details of the dramatic historical events of the beginning of the twentienth century. If you liked Follett's Pillars books, you will almost certainly like this book as well.
1401322786|5.0|Since Tuesdays with Morrie, I have read every one of Mitch Albom's non-sports books.  I enjoy the way Albom writes, so I'm partial, but this particular book has great meaning and depth.  For proof, look at this quote...<br />\\"There is a reason God limits our days.\\"<br />\\"Why?\\"<br />\\"To make each one precious.\\"<br />--from Mitch Albom's book - the time keeper<br />That says it all!
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|only about 2 gemstones in and the game is fun. it seems pretty easy so far because of the amulet power. we will see as the game progresses. it is a nice twist on a match 3 game.

0316228532|1.0|This book is so awful I quit reading after the first 20 pages...it seems that in order to be ADULT you have to be as crude and vulgar as possible with no story line in between the nastiness. Where did the writer go that wrote such engaging books that adults loved and read them right along with the tweens in the household? She certainly lost her muse with this thing...don't waste your time or money...I'm taking it back tomorrow and having learned my lesson, will NEVER read anything she \\"writes\\" again.
0345803493|5.0|As I hurried on to book two I found myself turning pages quicker and quicker. I lost sleep trying to read to get to book three. When I was not reading I could think of nothing but the books. It had by far been the best books I had read ever!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I bought a kindle fire for my Mom's birthday and she LOVEs it. Not a gal who embraces computer Technology this is user friendly and decided I would add pictures and games to her fire before giving it to her. This is one of her favorite games, all the thrill of the carnival game without all the lost money. Very realistic and fun, you won't be disappointed

B004YM6JI2|5.0|I've been a fan of this show since day one, so anyone who buys season 7 must also be!  I got a great deal on this set, the price dropped by almost 20 dollars and It was too good to pass up.  I own all of the seasons and don't have a single complaint.  It arrived a day earlier than I expected also.  Love amazon!!
0345803507|5.0|So as I rushed through book 3 loving ever minute and sad to be getting to the end at the same time! Loving ever character I'd come to know. It had the best ending in a book I'd read. It left me wanting souch more. I await sequels!

B0072OFM28|4.0|The saga of season two, with new actors, stories and drama is just as good as season one.  Still full of tension and battles.
B004JHYRP4|5.0|I especially enjoyed the parts on the alien planet; the three beings who made a family were facinating. The book seems applicable today because of continuing concerns with caring for the environment.<br />Recommended for adults and teens.<br />D. L Burnett
B005LAIISA|4.0|The Ice Age series, across the four in the series, has been full of adventure and fun, and Continental Drift is no different. Scrat the squirrel starts the continental drift in his never ending pursuit of the acorn. Manny is separated from Ellie and Peaches during the drift and there begins his adventure with buddies Diego and Sid.<br /><br />Sid is united with his family who, it turns out, just wanted to leave his granny with him and disappear. The granny, voice of Wanda Sykes, brings in fine humor. The pack, in their attempt to reunite Manny with his family, runs into evil Captain Gutt, the reigning pirate of the frozen waters. They venture off with his boat after beating his crew, only to run into him again. Here starts a friendship between Diego and Shira. Captain Gutt in a desperate attempt to get even with Manny holds Peaches hostage. Manny and the entire pack, including Granny, fight back with gusto.<br /><br />The overall pace and adventure of The Continental Drift is at par with the previous versions, it's non-stop adventure with funny scenes that kids will enjoy. However, it feels like more of the same over and over again. There isn't much depth of content, no new ideas, no scintillating graphics, and no meaningful development of characters.<br /><br />That being said, the movie is still great fun for the entire family. It's adventurous, funny, and definitely worth a watch.

B0052RDHTM|5.0|Ken Follett is a master at writing novels that immerse you into the setting. I especially love his historical novels. They are so well researched that you \\"feel\\" the environment and the characters. One of my favorites is \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" and its sequel \\"World Without End\\". These are must reads for lovers of fast paced, accurate historical novels. \\"Fall of Giants\\" (and its sequel \\"Winter of the World\\") are in the same tradition. These make up two parts of a planned three book trilogy. His novels follow generations of characters sometimes over centuries, but certainly over decades. You can't go wrong with any Follett book but this one and its sequel are highly recommended.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Great game, fun to play.  Some challenge but not frustrating.  A great match 3 type of game with a good idea behind it.  Not sure it is worth $4.99 but as a FAOTD well worth the download.

B0031YJFCQ|5.0|It was a great ending to the first books. it is a must read, especially if you read the other two!
B001CDZZI6|3.0|I originally bought the book used, hoping I could buy a code through the website.  And you can, but for more than the book costs brand new.  Yet even having the book at all is for mere reference of the online content.  I am disappointed for as credible Gallup and its associates are purported to be, since it seems like a swindler's move for there to be such disparity between print and online cost to customers.<br />The best way to have the book is through Kindle.  The cost is the same, the content is the same, and so one can actually use the book and not feel cheated.  It is odd that a book titled \\"Strength Finder 2.0\\" has such an issue, requiring some customers to become resourceful in obtaining a usable code for the online assessment.<br />As for the book's content, I suspect for those with higher introspection the online assessment's findings will not be much of a surprise and would thus feel like a waste all but for giving them a vocabulary to discuss their strengths categorically.  However, I can see this book being a useful tool for high school students.  The guiding principle holds up under scrutiny: why spend so much time practicing what one isn't good at when that time may otherwise be spent developing a strength, and turning that strength into a mastery?<br />The book's views may also be helpful for those in charge of education and training programs, in reassessing the purpose of education and what the primary objective of education is when so much of it is about practice and development.<br />This type of thinking, thought, is not new, groundbreaking, or surprising in regards to the findings about strength development and managerial approach.  Any Montessori school has been practicing these methods for ages.  It is just nice to have a way to describe one's strengths and then work toward how to best have them coalesce.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book just kept getting better and better. I couldn't put it down. Definitely left me wanting more!!  I can't wait to read the next one!!!  Thank you for writing such amazing books!!!
B000X418UE|5.0|This transfer of 'The Rock' on to Blu Ray shows what a company can do if they put their minds to it.  Too many older films like this one are simply reformatted to fit Blu Ray rather than worked on to either remaster or just improve the transfer.  While I don't provide plot summaries or my opinions on acting, just a review of the transfer, the Rock has a loaded cast full of well known actors like Ed Harris, Nick Cage(when he was still doing quality movies, Sean Connery, Michael Biegn, and a host of those well known character actors whose names you often can't recall.<br /><br />The video transfer to Blu Ray is really very good.  Early in the movie the colors appear a touch soft and desaturated, however, my thinking is that this is deliberate as the skies are cloudy and the island dismal and dreary, thus the colors fit the environment.  In the city scenes you have a much greater brightness for the colors to shine through and, in some scenes, pop.  I could detect no artifacting, aliasing or banding anywhere within  the Blu Ray transfer tho there might be the slightest hint of grain on the rear office walls within the penitentiary.  You really have to look closely for it tho so I wouldn't pay any mind to it.  Even in the dark scenes there is a great deal of depth and detail.<br /><br />The PCM uncompressed 3/2.1 audio is the star of the film's transfer with excellent use of the discreet channels for panning and movement.  In the bathroom scene, when Ed Harris first calls for his solders to stop firing the dialogue comes from behind you.  Other than foley fx, it is not often that you hear dialogue coming from the rears even on some of the best transfers.  I had to play the scene again to make sure I was hearing it correctly it so surprised me.  Hope you have a good processor and sound system as the audio presents a very balanced leveling from the music score to the various foley fx.  My only complaint was my realization that the music score during the car chase in San Francisco was either dated or corny, I haven't decided which but I have seen this film many times on Standard Def DVD and never really realized that until I saw it on Blu Ray.<br /><br />While I wouldn't say that this is the disc to use as a Demo disc, it does show off your system and how good a blu ray can be when compared to its Standard Def counterpart.<br /><br />There are also many extras detailing the underwater scenes, some funny outtakes including Ed Harris getting angry at blowing his lines on the phone and plenty more.  There is a short history of Alcatraz, as well as a few shorts on what type of shooting we see in the movies as opposed to how they should be correctly done if you were in the military or on a police force.  The only negative is that there are a full 7 previews of other films which come on as soon as you insert the disc.  Previews of other films takes up valuable disc space which calls for more compression to the film itself.  It is the one feature I hate to see on any DvD, Blu Ray or not.<br /><br />Other than that, this is a great transfer and well worth the purchase or upgrade if you already have it on Standard Def as I do.<br />All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.<br />Thanksancisco was either dated or corny, I haven't decided which but I have seen this film many times on Standard Def DVD and never really realized that until I saw it on Blu Ray.<br /><br />While I wouldn't say that this is the disc to use as a Demo disc, it does show off your system and how good a blu ray can be when compared to its Standard Def counterpart.<br /><br />There are also many extras detailing the underwater scenes, some funny outtakes including Ed Harris getting angry at blowing his lines on the phone and plenty more.

B0047X4926|5.0|All of Rihanna's recent albums are good, lets get that out of the way.  But... this one is pretty much great start to finish.  And as big as the singles were, I think the real gems on this are in the album tracks.  Skin is just amazing.  It will take a few listens to sink in because its slower and it builds over time... but her work with Nuno (from Extreme) doing the guitar on this song is just phenominal.  I wish they would do more collaborations.  My other favorite is Complicated... the vocals in that are soaring and great.  If someone was just starting out on Rihanna... this is the album I would tell them to get first.  As others have pointed out... this album has the most variety within it of all her albums and yet it still sounds cohesive. All the variety shines a strong light on just how unique and great her voice is!<br /><br />Rihanna rocks... and when she comes around... if you can only go to one concert a year or so... make it Rihanna.  I have been going to concerts all my life for decades and I have seen it all, the good, the bad, the ugly... across many genres... and Rihanna's Loud Tour ranks as my clear #1 stadium show ever witnessed.  She included pretty much anything a stage show could be judged on.  The only problem Rihanna is going to soon have is not having enough time in a concert to even be able to play all of her hit songs... pretty soon she will be leaving some hits out because she has to.
B008CFN95I|1.0|I didn't enjoy this book at all and found myself finishing it for the sake of the $10 I spent on the kindle edition. What a waste of time and money. I found the storyline childish and too unbelievable. The ending is so anti-climax too.

B004I8WD6E|5.0|The screen protector is easy to apply and is a must to keep your screen scratch free.  The protective case is great. I love it. It is flexible and can absorb some impact, plus gives a good gripping surface.  Phone doesn't slide off things, or out of your hand!  slight top edge keeps screen from making direct contact with surfaces when set down. After seeing my friends cracked screens, and the number of times I almost dropped my phone before I got this case, I feel so much more confident now with this protection! Does not interfere with any phone controls. Even my teenage son loves it.
0143116738|3.0|After seeing his TED talk I was really interested in getting into the meat of his research. I had hoped this book would provide that, I was disappointed. The majority of the book focuses on the need of artists and entertainers. There is only so examples of a few schools he likes, and little practical data.<br /><br />If he had titled the book, \\"Helping your child find their Element.\\" I would have been OK. However he has not convinced me that restructuring the school system wold do much more than find a few missing musicians and authors.<br /><br />Of course it could be because I finished \\"Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking\\" by Susan Cain about the same time. A book that had a much more powerful and rewarding message for me.
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|This movie was a total waste of money. I hated the jerky hand held camera filming. It made me motion sick and i'm not prone to motion sickness. And who runs around filming during a monster attack!! he would have to hold up the camera while running and stuff, i mean come on. This stupid, contrived filming affectation was the absolute worst thing about this movie.<br /><br />For a supposed monster movie, there is very little monster. The whole movie isjust running around with a bunch of shallow, annoying young people. The dialogue consists of \\"oh my god\\" and \\"oh s***\\" repeated over and over. Instead of getting to safty, these people go on a mission to save another shallow, vapid girl in her destroyed appartment building.<br /><br />The girls run around in their heels the whole time.<br /><br />Where did all the military people and equipment and weapons and emergency medical stations come from? One of the first things we see are buildings falling andbridges callapsing, and yet tanks and trucks and armed men are storming through the streets within the hour, streets clear of even traffic. Please.<br /><br />I had more to write but its a waste of time even to type what a waste of time and money this movie was.
B008AX1HD8|4.0|When I first read \\"The Redbreast\\" I assumed that it was the first in the Harry Hole series, only to discover there were mentions of past events in the life of character Harry Hole that suggested earlier books. In fact the English publisher had opted to publish the third book in the series first, leaving the first two books - The Bat and The Cockroaches - untranslated into English. Therefore, if like me, you hate reading series books out of order, you will be glad that The Bat has finally arrived.<br /><br />Harry Hole is in Sydney to investigate the murder of Inger Holter, a Norwegian citizen working in Australia. Inger was young, blonde and she was found dumped in Gap Park, having been raped and strangled. As Inger was a minor television celebrity in her home country, having hosted a children's television programme a few years previously, the case is considered important enough to have aroused interest in Norway's press. In this book we discover much about Harry's character, as he investigates a possible serial killer. Admittedly, I can understand the publisher wishing to begin the series with another book - in many ways this is pretty standard fare, and the digressions in Aboriginal culture and folk tales are, frankly, pretty boring in parts. However, there is much in this novel which is good, the plot is fast paced and Andrew Kensington, an Aboriginal detective, is a great side character. More to the point, this is the starting point of the series and, as readers, we should be given the chance to read them in order and not have publishers decide how and when we can read them. I hope they will publish the second book in the series as quickly as possible in English, so readers of the series can read them completely in the order the author intended.
B002VWNIDG|5.0|I love this movie. The book by Stephen King is also a favorite. If you haven't read the book, i recommend it. Its different and better than the movie in many ways. The book has more characters and a more in depth plot. There is so much that goes on in Jack's head in the book, and before i saw the movie i wondered how they could communicate all of it in a movie. They did a great job. Jack Nicholson does some amazing acting and i was not disappointed. There are some things different than the book, but i found it didn't ruin a thing for me. The scenery and the sound track gave me chills. Great movie from a great book.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|I am about 3/4 of the way through the book. It's been very easy to read and has included some interesting insights on human behavior. Much of the book has been on human behavior in the corporate/retail space, which is exactly what I was looking for. This book will simply get you to think more about why you do what you do and could be the jump start to a new beginning for you.
159420411X|5.0|This is a great book.  Nate is brilliant, and it is a pleasure to see the world through his eyes.  Truly insightful.  I highly recommend it.
B0086700CM|5.0|it so fun and I also play it alot.it is a good game to play. it is a good game
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|It's a great game and I enjoy playing it on the computer but Mahjong is difficult to play on the Android phone.
B004UPANAI|5.0|My wife is a MARVEL fan and she loves all the MARVEL characters. I get every move they make when it comes out. When she is happy, I'm happy...
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|This is a rather boring game. I really don't like it at all. Graphics are ok. Will probably delete from my kindle.
B001LM1456|5.0|Again, when my wife is happy, I am happy...  I get my wife all the MARVEL movies when they come out. She is a serious MARVEL fan.

B005PK553C|5.0|Can't wait until tonight's season 2 premier. Jessice Lange is perfect in this series. Adam Levine will make a great addition
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great read very interesting action and characters. I am a new reader and this was a great first book thanks....
B0067R0APK|3.0|Not sure it is width the purchase fir this weather buff. of late it isn't updating. But as weather apps go it is not bad.
B008XG1X18|4.0|For the most part I love the application, but I would like to be able to view more pins per category.
B002SRQ214|5.0|I took a gamble when I bought this Phenom II 965BE for my Biostar TA790GXE 6.1, because the CPU wasn't \\"officially\\" supported.  ...But my Biostar did support the AMD 955 CPU, which I assumed was close enough to the 965 (and it is).  The CPU works great so far, but the fan is pretty loud when under a heavy load.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+ As of October 2012, this CPU has an almost unbeatable cost/performance ratio.<br />+ Worked in my Biostar TA790GXE motherboard, despite not being officially supported.<br />+ Although I'm not going to overclock it, I read reviews saying that they were able to overclock the 965 by 600MHz (and it was stable, though I don't recall if they used water or air to achieve that overclocking).<br />+ Under load (playing a game) the CPU runs cool at a respectable ~53C thanks to the great heatsink/fan that comes with the CPU.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- The fan makes lots of noise when under a heavy load; it might just be because my motherboard doesn't officially support the CPU...  The fan is quite when just surfing the web, etc.<br /><br />If you're a gamer using a 720p monitor then this CPU will run all your games at max graphics and get you a really smooth frame rate.  ...However, if you're using a 1080p monitor, don't expect to get much more than ~30fps when at high graphics.  I recommend this CPU!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The \\"Fifty Shades of Grey: Book One, is a an awesome book....kept me reading every chance I could. It actually got me to get a kindle, and I have three more books on top of this one. Mind you I wasn't much of a reader, but now all I can think about is reading and have stepped away from the computer and TV so I could do just that.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is a great game to play. I like that you get coins while you are offline. my nephew likes to use my coins
0345803493|5.0|I love the book. Ana and Christian are funny and cute. The book made me laugh and tear up. Not sure how this will play on the big screen, it very pornish. But can wait to see it!!!
B008673ZAQ|4.0|This was a very good book, a fast read for me.  For fans of 50 Shades, this is a tamer version, which is the books only downfall- the plot lines are extremely similar. It almost feels like they are written by the same author with names and details changed.<br />I would still recommend reading it though.
B000SEIK2S|3.0|I've read a lot of good praise for Old Man's War so I went into it with heightened expectations.  I found it a quick, entertaining read, but I have a few criticisms: the main character's \\"voice\\" irritated me.  The smart-alec hero does not translate well from TV to the printed page, and it was difficult for me to find him a sympathetic character.  The plot seemed to meander all over the place with no real conflict or resolution, and I thought the ending was fairly abrupt, as if the author had just run out of inspiration.  Overall, I rate this three stars.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|JanN6<br />I think this is so much fun but its also addictive. Don't let that stop you from playing this app. The best thing is it is free.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I read it over about five days. My guess is many read it even more quickly. Many parallels to the Hunger Games and should do as well. This book convinces me the world of successful self-publication  has arrived.
B001NLKS16|4.0|I liked it!  Gave some information about the past and how Sam and Dean became hunters.  Followed the TV series pretty much.  Would recommend it only if you are a fan of Supernatural TV series.
0062183591|5.0|So many times people want to say that if you've read these 47.5 words, you know everything this book has to offer and can go ahead and save your hard earned.  Often I heed those warnings or try to find the book in the library.<br /><br />However, I was so interested in the Wall Street Journal article which discussed this book from a few month ago, that I went ahead and took the leap.  After all, I think I am an honest person.  And I (think I) always strive to be more so - and especially to be a proper role model for my family.<br /><br />This book contains much more than the sound bites you may have heard about a study about some college students getting paid to tell how many answers they said they got right on some silly math test and determining that most people cheat, but only a little, only enough to convince themselves that they are still honorable people.<br /><br />The author discusses study after study which express variations on the theme of honesty in many situations.  I appreciated how thorough he was.<br /><br />One complaint: his discussion on the societal effects of dishonesty was somewhat more superficial than it should have been.<br /><br />I think most of us want more than just to be known as honest, we want to fully believe ourselves to be honest. This book reminds us how we often delude ourselves and gives suggestions on how to help ourselves be that person we want to be.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Another great book by Rick Riordan! Upset that we are left hanging at the end and have to wait another year!!
B0076L9W9Q|5.0|This album totally rocks! Lizzie Hale has an amazing voice and vocal range. I love the entire CD and recommend that you buy this also and I can not say enough good things about it.
B009GEEMLY|4.0|This may not be the BEST Marvel movie ever made, but it's very good and you should see it at least once if you're a Marvel Movie fan.  It's interesting and fun to see how the different characters interact with one another and to see how the movie's writers have woven the characters' story lines together to make \\"movie logic\\".
B0086700CM|5.0|when i heard about this game i had have it . Now i am a madter a t it .i have all thr carecters
B003ASLJKO|3.0|Not a bad movie but not one of my favorite Clint eastwood movies.Nothing against Burt Renolds he's a great actor too. Just not a great movie but OK
B00338QENI|5.0|Great book about medical research, science, racism, morals and ethics. Read it twice! Once for leisure and then once for class. The author mixes conversations of ethical health issues, racism, and science in a format that is very easy to understand.
B006BAEQB2|5.0|This was a fantastic book! I really enjoy Gregory's books and I finished this one in just over 24 hours. A real page turner!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved all three books...hoping it will successfully translate to the big screen. You get so caught up  in life of Katniss E. and all that surround her! Great book!
B008673ZAQ|2.0|I was not impressed.  Started with a great deal of review details about the first book.  The characters were never developed.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|This book is A-W -E -S -O -M - E read it  .its so good but read the Percy Jackson series first so you can understand this book and some of the characters
1423140605|5.0|This book was very good, i love how Rick shows the tension between roman and Greek demigods. The ending was excellent, yet another cliff hanger. Cant wait for the next book!
0517548232|5.0|The book is about economics, but is not a primer or introduction to economics.<br /><br />The \\"One Lesson\\" is stated in Part One of the book: \\"The art of economics consists in looking not merely at the immediate but at the longer effects of any act or policy; it consists in tracing the consequences of that policy not merely for one group but for all groups.\\"<br /><br />Hazlitt clearly shows that when policies give preferential treatment to special interests, everyone else pays for it. Hazlitt discusses the problems with subsidies, tariffs, price controls, rent controls, mandatory wages and inflationary monetary policy. These panaceas are shown to be harmful to the economy and are thus bad policy.<br /><br />This is not politics, it's basic economics.<br /><br />This book was first written more than a half-century ago, but the policies that caused the housing bubble and the subsequent economic collapse are fully discussed.<br /><br />The only drawback to \\"Economics in One Lesson\\" are some outdated references to people and events.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Angry Birds;<br />Now a classic android game...<br />This has it all!<br />Fun,<br />Addictive,<br />Cute<br />Easy to learn,<br />Hard to master!<br />You can't beat this with a stick!
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Well, since it's the last book in the series you HAVE to read it.  Just don't expect too much.  I really got the feeling that the author wasn't too sure how to wrap up the story, and especially how to deal with the Peeta-Gale issue, so she just threw something together and gave up.  For a series that started with so much promise, it was a very unsatisfactory ending.<br /><br />I'm actually hoping that when they make the movie they fix it up and make a better story and ending out of it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Fun game easy to play nice graphics I enjoy playing it every chance I get especially when I am waiting for my family in a store
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Reflected in You was a much anticipated sequel to Bared to You.  The relationship between Gideon and Eva progresses to a more serious stage.  Both characters are still battling their private demons.  Outside events put a great deal of stress on their shaky relationship.  Their insane jealousies of each other was a little hard to swallow.  But I suppose with their emotional problems, it is understandable.  The previously alluded to step-brother makes a reappearance in Eva's life which complicates matters.  Eva's lack of trust in Gideon leads to misunderstandings.  Gideon's insecurities cause Eva a lot of heartache.  But the story comes to a surprising, unconventional and satisfying end.
B0098VXE50|4.0|If it is a indeed a retold fairy tale please stick with the magic aspect.  It trys to have magic and Christian values and it makes holes in the story line.  I had fun but it needed some script work.

B006YC74E8|1.0|no good!
B00571F26Y|4.0|The author lays out a detailed case that explains how and why wheat either causes or exacerbates the following things:<br />1.) Obesity<br />2.) Arthritis<br />3.) Excessive appetite<br />4.) Brain \\"fog\\"<br />5.) High cholesterol<br />6.) Celiacs<br />7.) Skin problems<br />etc...<br /><br />It is certainly a thought provoker and has caused me to examine my diet and think again before I eat wheat (gluten) laden foods. Read it and come to your own conclusion.

B00992CF6W|4.0|I love this game its definitely worth the money. me and my brother play its and iits awesome. the only bad thing is that it has no lava costumes mine carts and and night day shifts in creative. other than that great game. hope for future updates
B008K5T5AI|1.0|This book has just been released and yet the Kindle price($17.40) is more than the Hardback price ($14.93).<br /><br />I thought eBook price fixing was a thing of the past?

B007THA4FI|1.0|J.K. wanted to get away from Hogwarts with Casual Vacancy, but where she went needs Harry's cloak.  I read 5 chapters and J.K. must have won a Quidditch Race and been awarded the universes's largest thesaurus.  J.K.'s chacters are many and without soul (who cares).  Five years in the making, Casual Vacancy reminds me of an open book essay question in high school where you don't want to leave any thing out and a one page assignment becomes a ludicrous<br />disertation bordering on the absurd.  Five chapters, a theme or direction should be there, this is not the case with Casual Vacancy.  J.K. has the ability to tell a great story, but Casual Vacancy reminds me to read the Kindle free chapters before buying a book, even from my favorite authors.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|great game. I have been playing this game for two days and I find it fun and challenging. good graphics and not many permissions.

B005LAIHY0|1.0|This is supposed to be a prequel to the excellent \\"Alien\\" series.  It fails in so many ways that I cannot begin to describe it other than just horrible.

1612183956|4.0|Wayward Pines, Idaho, is quinessential small town America or so it seems.  Sec Service Agent Ethan Burke arrives in search of two missing federal agents.  Soon he is facing more than he bargained for.  After a violent accident lands him in the hospital, Ethan comes to with no Id, no cell phone and no money.  The medical staff seems friendly enough, but something feels . . . off.  As the days pass, Ethans investigation into his colleagues' disapearance turns up more questions than answers.<br /><br />Why can't he make contact with his family in the outside world?  Why doesnt anybody believe he is who he says he is? what is the purpose of the elecgrified fences encircling the town? are they keeping residents in? or something else out?<br /><br />this book grabs you and wont let you go. A non stop read that will keep you guessing.  loved it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|A real rare gem of an indie book. Highly recommend this for any sci-fi fans or any fans of a really good book.

B005D9MUWY|1.0|I have been using Swiftkey for almost 2 years and through 3 phones now, I downloaded it when it was a FREE APP OF THE DAY through the Amazon App Store. This is hands down the most intuitive and productive typing app available for your android device and I recommend it to anyone I know who has an android device. With that being said, the reason for the single star is specifically for buying this product from the amazon app store. After recently getting a replacement device on warranty I tried to re-download this app, however it will not fully install, according to swiftkey's website this is a known issue with buying this app from Amazon. In closing I will say that this app is worth every bit of the $4 that Google Play is currently charging for this app and I have never paid for an app for any of my phones ever.
B0053O89KG|5.0|Season 4 of Castle is a instant hit! We have all 4 seasons and they just keep getting better and better. I love the connection between Beckett and Castle! Pure bliss. The favorite connect  of all the how the relationship between Castle and his daughter Lexi are. Oh how I wish that ever father/daughter relationship could be just like that!
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I loved this book way more than the first. I thought it was very well written, didn't include nearly as much sex (which is a good thing sometimes), and the connection between Guideon and Eva was more defined. In the first book I really didn't understand their draw to each other, It was kind of a random connection. The reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because I really felt like a majority of the book was conflict and I don't like that. I don't like the fact that by the time they FINALLY solved the main isssue, that was the length of the entire book, the book ended! Thats kind of lame and a cop-out..my opinion. I won't lie, I am interested in the finale, but only because I want to see how it all ends. I would recommend reading it though. It is an interesting tale.
7883700928|5.0|Very Fast shipping for an international package.  Adorable inspiring movie for little girls.  I ordered this for my daughter who is in Mandarin immersion school.  She loves it, it plays in the background during playtime some days and she points out words she knows.<br /><br />Please note - it does not work on American DVD players.  We took the spare laptop and changed the region code to China and used an HDMI cable to hook to the television.  Or you could invest in a region free dvd player.  You can only change your region code a few times - so be very careful.

B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Very good book, it can be sad. maybe make you tear up a little . But it does have a happy ending. I loved this book. <3
1476712042|5.0|Okay if you have not read Beautiful Disaster yet I will give you a tad bit of info I've gathered. Beautiful Disaster seems like the type of book that you either loved or hated. I loved it, although I can see why some people may not have. I am absolutely going to be reading this book over and over again until Walking Disaster comes out. Beautiful Disaster is exquisitely written, just all around amazing. I wasn't exactly sure how I felt about it after I read it except I really liked it, but I have to say it is a personal favorite.<br /><br />Abby:<br />I have to say I liked reading about Abby's character. She has an extremely dark and depressing past and I was happy that her life's secrets weren't revealed right away and that I found out about them as the story progressed. In the beginning she has a lot of reservations about dating Travis due to the fact he represents everything she is running away from.<br /><br />Travis:<br />There is a lot of freaking out, and violence in this book. Travis has a lot of major outbursts in this book that may freak some people out. He NEVER hit Abby, I am saying this now just so you know. He does however break a lot of stuff, kick a lot of ars, and it's incredibly intense and insane.<br />Travis does have a lot of good points though despite the violence. I was happy that at the beginning they more or less stated he has a lot of problems and messes up a lot with people he cares about, mainly because then throughout the book there was that understanding. And he does, he messes up a lot, but I think that he just didn't know how to show his love any other way. He does change a lot throughout the book, mainly because of Abby.<br />I think readers will either completely love or hate Travis so if you don't like him in the beginning I don't really see you liking him later.<br /><br />Both characters have a lot of emotional problems to work out, and honestly a disaster is more or less what I would define both of them when they aren't together and when they are. Even while they're friends they both just insane and I think at some point in the book they realize they make no sense and that that's okay. They both understand each other and even though sometimes they do and say stupid stuff they always understand that that's who they are and respect that. Neither of them wanted to change they other and I think that's another aspect that made them so great together.<br /><br />Both characters are pretty much codependent on each other and I think that while some readers may hate that about them, it made me like them even more. I liked that they weren't perfect and couldn't stand not spending time with each other. That they got jealous and had insane arguments. Honestly those aspects made me like them more because no real life relationship is perfect, and while the other person may drive us completely insane we love them anyway.<br /><br />Abby's best friend is honestly hysterical and her boyfriend Shepley also Travis's cousin is extremely annoying. When meeting Travis's family I instantly fell in love, they are all just amazing and funny characters, a lot like Travis so I mean what's not to love?<br /><br />I hope you pick up a copy of this book soon. Let me know what you thought of my review, I was extremely excited that I liked this books so much since I wasn't sure before I read it, but it is now a new favorite.and when they are.

B007TBZ63Y|5.0|It's as good if not better than all the previous ones... can't wait for the next !! Love that it doesn't focus on one hero like before, ie Jason or Percy, but that everyone brings something essential to the table.<br /><br />Hate that I have to wait one year to get the next one !!! :)
B008I3QZKU|5.0|Mature.  Complex.  Sophisticated.  Intense.  Provocative.  Insightful.<br /><br />\\"What are you made of...?\\"<br /><br />That's the not-so-rhetorical question posed in this sweeping epic's opening track - to which the deceptively obvious answer is \\"Flesh and Bone.\\"  But the way Brendan Flowers delivers the line, you just know he means sooooo much more than that.  Spirit and soul render us more than the sum of our parts, the depths of which are plumbed through these twelve burning, yearning tracks.  Part description, part prescription, he's pushing himself outside well-worn comfort zones.  Isn't that the hallmark of every great artist?<br /><br />Back to \\"Flesh and Bone\\":  this track grabs you by the collar and never lets go, delivering more intensity, variety, and vocal/lyrical invention than you'll ever find in four minutes and one second.  It ends too soon -- and that's precisely the point.<br /><br />By way of background, I was waaaaay late jumping on The Killers bandwagon - you might even say I deliberately avoided/ignored all the fuss about Hot Fuss.  It was just too implausible to fathom that any band could improve on the New Wave canon enshrined by musical deities like Depeche Mode and New Order.  Five years went by after the Hot Fuss release and I couldn't even glimpse it in the rearview mirror.  But then one day I was burning down the freeway and burning up over one thing or another and \\"Mr. Brightside\\" came on the radio and, y'know, I starting throwing elbows and knees to make myself some room and hauled my carcass up on The Killers bandwagon.<br /><br />It's been a nice ride up here, I must say.  Although I only came away with two keepers from Sam's Town (\\"When You Were Young\\" and \\"Read My Mind,\\" like, duh!), Day & Age was a pretty strong (and frequent repeat) play end-to-end.  Still reach for \\"Human\\" when I need a lift.<br /><br />Along comes \\"Battle Born\\" just a few days before my 42nd birthday, and what better remedy to make 42 feel more like 22?  I don't get the scorn heaped on this ambitious ensemble from the nosebleed seats.  I don't see (er, hear) it as much of a departure from Hot Fuss and the rest of the corpus.  Sure, it's a bit more glimmery and shimmery, a bit more reminiscent of power pop acts like Ric Ocasek & The Cars (\\"The Way It Was\\"), with a dash of the power chord showmanship pioneered by Rush (especially in the album-closing \\"Battle Born,\\" which rivals any anthem by The Alarm, Big Country, and the aforementioned Rush).  But not every track is a pulse-pounding wall-of-sound -- some are surprinsingly subtle, so there's enough variety on display here to make your ears feel like they've travelled many, many miles.  Brendan Flowers strikes me as an old soul with a searching perspective and a yearning in his heart - for living life to its fullest, novel experience, star-gazing wonder, understanding, and naturally, love.  He savors the journey while aching for the destination.<br /><br />\\"Runaways\\" - the obvious first single - churns along with half-fulfilled promises of freedom.  \\"Deadlines and Commitments\\" delivers a compelling (and refreshingly platonic) \\"I'm-in-your-corner-no-matter-what\\" theme.  I'll let you discover the rest of these gems on your own.<br /><br />So ask yourself:<br /><br />\\"What are you made of...?\\"'t get the scorn heaped on this ambitious ensemble from the nosebleed seats.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Just picked it up because I was bored and it was cheap. I bounced back and forth between 4 - 5 stars, but upon consideration.. I've already told several of my friends to pick it up, so wouldn't I be doing it a disservice to not say I loved it?<br /><br />Enjoyed it thoroughly, I could prattle on and on about the parts I enjoyed, but mostly it was something a bit different and I really enjoyed how the story evolved. Can't help but recommend it.<br /><br />If I had any complaints it was the way in which it just kind of CHOP CHOP CHOPPED off the ending at book 5. Maybe that was just me? I'd have liked a little more fan service. Some of the descriptions on things ran a bit long and redundant, but I think this is in part driven by the fact the protagonist is elsewhere at the time and I REALLY WANTED TO KNOW WHAT WAS HAPPENING THERE!! So eh, take that with a grain of salt.<br /><br />Overall I recommend you checkout this book, I was barely able to put it down, I just had to FIND OUT how this all happened, what got them all there. It appears his next book in this universe addresses more of those questions, I look forward to checking it out as well.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I have tried multiple spider solitaire games and this is most definitely my favorite version. The graphics could be a little better, but that is a small gripe compared to the overall quality of the application.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Can't wait for the 3rd book of the series! Very similar to 50 Shades. Male leads are extremely similar, same kind of issues.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I really enjoyed the drama suspense and humor in these books, more so than the mommy porn :-)  It did feel a little rushed towards the end.  I  wish the writer  could add more books to this series.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|I'm a huge Jodi Picoult fan, and although I really enjoyed this book, it left me with many unanswered questions.  I can appreciate leaving some things up to the reader's imagination, but this just left me frustrated.  Melanie's actions literally angered me at times.  Nevertheless, this book took me on an emotional roller coaster, and I'm glad I read it despite wanting just a little bit more.  Heart-wrenching subject matter.
0385333846|5.0|I missed this in the 60's...so now I'm reading everything Vonnegut has written. The newspaper compact style is what I love and will emulate where possible. Thought provoking with high impact. Dresden relived with unknown insights from the writter. Billy Pilgrim could be anyone's neighbor...but with a deep and dark past. Thanks
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|does what it says it does, can be addicting, but also a good time passer,  but also if you want to get more coins you can by some, but I have not needed to buy anything and I will never buy any.
B000WS4QJG|3.0|In my opinion this CD is not as good as the original Thriller CD.  I was hoping for the original recording of the Thriller CD, I don't care much for the revised version of Thriller.  Is it possible to purchase the original CD anymore? Is it just pas se? I hope in the near future the release of the original will be available for purchase.  If you decide to purchase just this CD, know it's not the same recording as it was in the eighties.
B000N6U0EC|1.0|I really wanted to watch this movie and have in my collection but it doesn't work. They shouldn't send products that doesn't work. I wasted my money for this garbage. It is better not to take the product from this company
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I think the title says it all, look up if you have any further questions. Sorry, needed five more words
B007TK77QE|3.0|A surprisingly dull offering which focuses on character descriptions for the first 100 pages. The latter half of this bleak book becomes slightly more engrossing. I am an avid fan of Rowling's writing but I was disappointed with this book.  I also think the sympathy with the teenage characters places this book more in the young adult genre -- it would seem that there are very few adults with any redeeming qualities I this tale.
B007F7QG0Y|4.0|I thought it would be a curious read... I was right.  Full of tidbits that perhaps only those who grew up with the Stones would appreciate. But also an interesting view of one man's and one band's evolution from music-loving poor boys through to the creation of the super stars they became, however unintentionally (on Richards' part).<br /><br />A good read, summer, winter, almost any time.
034580404X|4.0|Good read. Definitely not what I expected. Some slow spots but definitely keep my interest. A person needs to keep an open mind although this book is not a hard core erotic or bondage story. Reminds a person that even the truest of hearts can suffer from skeletons hidden deep in the past but with the right person in thier life they can be overcome.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I had read other's reviews of this book and was kind of skeptical about reading it, but it has been on the bestseller's list since this summer so I figured something must be great about it.  I started reading it and couldn't put it down.  I even snuck my Kindle into work and read it in between patients.  It was THAT good!  Many are disappointed by the ending, I think the ending was genius!  LOVE IT!!!!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Love the app. Not only does it tell you how much battery life it tells you how long you can run other apps
B008PZ69T8|5.0|This is a collection that is so beautiful..I can not seem to play this cd enough..And it can put you in the mood!!!
B000FCK42M|5.0|An excellent inside look at the Mexican drug cartels, and how the US handles it. Very hard to tell whether the book is fiction or non-fiction, it is written so informatively and dramatically.
B0028RXXE8|5.0|My daughter told us about this Rome series she love it and felt that we would also enjoy. My husband and I enjoyed this very much we could not stop watching.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I read it so quickly and thought the ending was quite original. I wasn't quite sure what direction it planned to go since at 65% it seemed that the story was ending! I'd be interested in reading more by this author. I highly recommend Defending Jacob.
0525953728|5.0|I found the account rendered in this book well-written.  The explanation of how the mission was conducted, the equipment utilized, the training required and the execution to be one that could only be explained by an operative.  No third party could have rendered such an account and I highly recomment it.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|This whole trilogy is awesome!! Each book is better than the next and impossible to put down. I highly recommend everyone read all 3 books!
B008TRUDAS|3.0|The events of this story occurred too coincidentally. Laken the main character in the story appeared so immature to have and adult relation ship with anyone. She came on too inexperienced to raise a brother let alone the time she needed to grow up and accept the challenges in life. All in all it was sad story about losing loved ones very close to us.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Good game, enjoyable for killing time.  Challenging at times which is good. Keeps adding new things to overcome.  Easy instructions and helpful guide.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Eva and Cross make a whirlwind couple in Reflected in You. Their love grows but also struggles. Eva is a wonderful character ,  I loved her even more in this book. She is strong even in the face of the man she loves.<br /> I read this book in a day, once I ordered it I couldn't fly through the pages fast enough. If you love the dominant sexy male whose heart is finally captured, with romance and heart ache at every corner, this book is for you.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|My son loves this book.  He cannot put it down.  He carries his kindle and reads every chance he gets.  He is 10 years old and in 5th grade.  I would highly recommend it to kids in his age group.
B004HW7JMY|5.0|Overall great shopping experience. Spartacus is a great series. This 2nd season is actually a prequal th the first season.
B00991TCOG|5.0|Lindsey has taken the violin to a modern, entertaining, and enjoyable listening experience.  Her music is so diverse and fun.  This is a must-have recording for all.  I've traveled to 29 countries and try to return home with indigenous music.  Lindsey's music would do well in all countries.  In addition, to watch her videos and hear her talk one realizes what a nice, pleasant, sincere, and fun person Lindsey is.  Lindsey reminds me of Danny MacAskill as he is also a wonderful human being and extremely talented person.  I look forward to more beautiful sound from Lindsey.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This 2nd book was just as good as the first one was. I can't wait until the 3rd book is available!!!! I think this series is way better than \\"50 Shades of Gray\\" ones.
B000JLQSW4|4.0|The package came later than I wanted for my trip to the Smoky Mountains. The case was cracked when I opened the package and that was a disappointment considering it took longer to get here.<br />Music still just as good though.<br />The broken case is why it is not 5 stars!
B000K7UG34|3.0|I was expecting Blu-Ray video quality and I got high definition.  The video quality was acceptable, however, it was not what we have been used to when we order Blu-Ray movie disc's.  The technician's who put this disc together utilized Blu-Ray technology, however, the end product was lackluster, at best.  If \\"We Were Soldiers\\" had been produced in 1959, then this disc would be acceptable.  Not worth the extra money to purchase this Blu-Ray disc, save yourself some moolah and get the widescreen version!
0385344333|1.0|First Reacher book that is a real bummer. Tedious beyond belief to fill pages. I think that if Reacher had looked to the sky we would have gotten 20 pages as to what Reacher thought about the cosmos. Pointless to say the least as is much of this book and plot.<br />Boring, dull, and more. SAVE your money and, if you must, pick it up at the library. In this particular book, a one-star rating is far more than it deserves.
B007ZI06FE|5.0|Please forgive me while I rave about Kiss of Steel -  what a great melding of steampunk and paranormal romance.  I have become enamored with steampunk romance recently, but there aren't many books in the genre where the steampunk trappings are integral to the story. Kiss of Steel is one of the rare ones where the  steampunk elements are woven into the fabric of the background instead of relying on 'hey, here's an airship'  decorating the story in order to steampunk-ize it. And I thought that the alternate London with its literal twist on bloodthirsty Bluebloods  - a twist to European history that also gave  a new significance to the use of guillotines in the French revolution  - was clever and I also liked that the Whitechapel setting  provided a suitably gritty backdrop for our down and out and desperate heroine, Honor.<br /><br />On the romance front, I loved the complicated hero, Blade, a gutter born Blueblood - who fights his blood hunger and darker nature around Honor. And while, being exceedingly hero-centric, it is easy for me to love the leading man, I also really liked Honor too.  I liked that she is smart and stubborn and that Honor's determination to protect those she loves doesn't make her seem 'too stupid to live' even when she insists on heading into dangerous territory. And I liked  that she eventually trusts Blade to go wild with her, but that it takes some time for her to learn that trust which makes for a nice build up to some pretty steamy intensity in their romance.<br /><br />So great steampunk/paranormal world, great leads and a satisfyingly steamy romance.  I loved Kiss of Steel and I am really looking forward to the next book, Kiss of Iron - the next up dangerous leading man is confused and definitely in need of some therapeutic loving.
B009QW7HMC|5.0|I watched this episode with the wind howling and screaming outside like it wanted to rip my house's face off. God, this episode and that wind both gave me the chills. This has everything you will want in a zombie thriller: high adrenaline in a very dark place. Quick, tough decisions. A brooding menace and a breathless and effective buildup of suspense. I do not know if I will sleep tonight.<br /><br />Most of the things that worried many fans about season 2 were not present in this episode. The women in the story had scenes that made sense and that showed their complexity. There were zombies ... and more zombies ... and more zombies. And more of Daryl Dixon, too. So as far as what many of us fans have been asking for, AMC has delivered. If the rest of Season 3 is like the premier episode, it will be an excellent season.<br /><br />Stant Litore
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This is an awesome book! Even better then the first series! I've read all of his books and this ones one of the best! Definitely one to read!
B008BM9L72|4.0|I have to say I can see what all the hype is about!! 50 Shades is an interesting read for many reasons, not the least of which is trying to understand what makes Christian tick. I did find some of the text confronting and a little graphic but still enjoyed the unfolding story.  I would recommend this book to any reader that has an open mind, an adult concept of relationships and isn't easily offended. Overall a good book, easy to read.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|Curious about the film, I picked up the novel and was captivated - by the language, idiom as deep asTwain's, the settings - wandering across the planet and through time, by the characters - drawn and then left suspended to await closure in the novel's carefully fractured structure,  by the themes of barbarism and greed and, finally, hope.  Grit and darkness, culture and idealism, brutality and perseverance.  I can't wait to start another book by David Mitchell.
B0085P2Z6E|3.0|Dialog is trite.  Characters should be drawn in doing other things instead of same ones over and over again. Very Harry Potteresque. Too many hidden object scenes. Liked the other games though. You get your money's worth.
1590171993|5.0|John Williams' STONER is remarkable.  The reality of Stoner's  struggles stays with you long after you<br />finish reading the book.  In some ways Stoner is  the 'every man' and in others he's uniquely different.  Given almost no love<br />by his parents and set to toil in the barren fields of his poor family farm, his father sends him off to an agricultural program<br />taught by the University.  Stoner decides to change his course and chooses English as his major.  He never leaves the school<br />but using all the patience and intellect he can muster in time he becomes a tenured professor.  So why is the book so compelling?<br />There are no beatings, rapes, murders, or steamy sexual encounters.  But the reality of stoners' struggles, the mistakes of<br />his marriage, the touching affair he has which opens his heart for awhile before all is snatched away is so lifelike and<br />real that you become his friend,  rooting for him, saddened by events, angry in turn when he is belittled and annoyed at<br />his willingness to accept  things that are unjust.<br /><br />Read Stoner.  You won't regret it.
B003H4I4JU|4.0|The book is excellent! It is a very well written sci-fi book that really gets you thinking! I haven't read too many book like it and I highly recommend it and all of Card's books!
B008G8SFGO|5.0|There are two ways to look at this album.<br /><br />The first is as a rock and roll album, and Monster is by all means, a fantastic rock album.  The album starts with a kick and plows through every song.  When you listen to the album, this is one of those few records where you can picture each song being played live and simply being awesome.  The album equates to a live performance and the album, like any good concert does not slow down.  Even the track \\"All for the love of rock and roll,\\" is up-tempo, and fun to sing along to.  That track clearly has a more laid back 70s vibe to it, but it still sounds fresh and new.  The rest of the songs are heavy and paced correctly for the song's theme.  My suggestion for this album is simply to sit back, turn the stereo way up, an just enjoy good solid rock and roll songwriting.<br /><br />The second way to look at this album is to ask if it is a good KISS album.  The answer to this is by far YES!  This is KISS' new \\"Creatures of the Night.\\"  Now do not start thinking that is sounds like \\"Creatures Part 2.\\"  What I mean by this is, is that this album is the album that KISS needed to do, just like they needed to do Creatures back in '82.  Back then, they had just released their most non-KISS album of all time, fans were leaving like lemmings to water, and the band was a disaster.  Creatures of the Night proved that KISS (and not the original four) were able to make a great rock album that would stand the test of time.  Now we come to 2012 with Monster and KISS has done it again.  The album does not sound like anything rehashed from their previous catalog.  It definitely has that KISS feel to it, but it has major balls.  The album is hard, it is fast, the singing and songwriting are solid, and although a bit different, it is truly a KISS album.<br /><br />For those who miss the original four, I get it.  When Ace and Peter were in KISS they put some amazing work out.  I challenge anyone to come up with a better guitar solo thanShock Me.  That solo just screams to be played at whatever level is just below breaking your speakers.  But if you understand KISStory you know that they did not pull their weight.  And although I still love his work, Anomaly is going to be a dust collector on my shelf, and Peter Criss wants to put out albums of ballads?  Take a look at \\"One For All.\\"  He is wearing some rainbow scarf and singing \\"Send in the Clowns,\\" for God's sake!  Tommy and Eric are great for the band.  And what are we looking for here?  A great KISS album or a great rock album?  Well guess what, we got both!<br /><br />This is the new KISS and it is awesome.  I just saw them again on The Tour, and they were amazing.  They play well together, they harmonize, the feed off of each other, and Monster proves it.  All of the songs were written in the band.  Members are getting credit for their parts.  This is truly a band effort, and it scores an A+.  There are no songs that lag.  One song after the next, and it is hard to pick a favorite on the album.  When was the last time you could say that about any album, not just a KISS album?  Now, I am a huge KISS fan, but I will admit that there are albums that sit on my self and do not get listened to very often.  Yet there are others that are constantly finding their way into the play list.  Hotter Than Hell, Dressed to Kill, Alive!, Love Gun, Creatures of the Night, Crazy Nights, Hot in the Shade (yes I am being serious), Alive III, and Psycho Circus are all great.  But I honestly have to say that Monster is right there in their top four.<br /><br />So, after 40 years and 20 albums, if they can put out a top four now, why would you not pick this album up?
B005PD0VDI|3.0|This isn't a movie, it is an experience. I have to be in right mood for viewing something like this. I also think it doesn't do the movie justice to watch it on a 21\\" TV screen. Because it is an experinece it needs a dark theatre and a large screen.
B001794FOK|3.0|I actually liked the Steven  C. Gould novel, don't expect to find much of that here, (in the book Davy didn't even meet Millie until half way through) - the movie would've been better if it had stuck to its origin material, instead of dropping almost everything but the title and a few character names. If you look past that, however, the story isn't too bad. With lots of action once it gets going, the effects are impressive and the extras are worthwhile as well. I bought the DVD version locally then got the Blu ray here at Amazon so I could see the improved image that's supposed to provide. When Davy meets his mother for the last time near the movies end he meets his sister (?), that's a quick view of Kristen Stewart you'll be getting, I didn't realize that until I saw her name in the credits.<br /><br />It's not a bad way to spend an afternoon or evening, just not a great movie.
B0036SXQEA|4.0|This is a character focussed movie in the spirit of Boogie Nights or Nashville.  It's a long movie -- more than three hours -- but the pacing is great and the stories unfold and intertwine very beautifully.  The ensemble cast is unbelievable in depth and talent and this film may very well be Tom Cruise's tour de force role.  If you are not a fan of Paul Thomas Anderson you should be.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I started reading this book after reading Gillian Flynn's other two novels, expecting similiar twisted, dark characters.  What I got instead was an amazing novel that had me from the first diary entry that Amy Dunne wrote!! This book teases, doles out small details without revealing too much, and then WHAM the author hits you over the head with the biggest bombshell EVER half way through the novel. I was floored and couldn't stop reading!<br /><br />If you enjoy reading novels where you really can't guess what is going to happen next, then this is for you!! You won't be able to put the book down until you have read it from cover to cover, and then won't be able to stop talking or thinking about it when you are done.<br /><br />If you have ever doubted your spouse's loyalty or wondered what they are really thinking, this novel will be the stuff of your nightmares!
B0087HT36U|5.0|Nettes Game das viel spass macht. Knobeln in verschiedenen Stages. Bomben Feuer und vieles andere zum gewinnen . Sehr abwechselnde Level.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|I use this APP as \\"school bells\\" in my classroom.  We don't have bells in my school, so I set this alarm for each block (period).  I plug my kindle fire into an external speaker to make it louder.<br /><br />One alarm to tell students to pack up.<br />Another alarm to let them leave the room.<br /><br />For specific classroom activities with a time limit, there is a separate timer.  It counts down with big numbers.  I place it under my document camera and project it on my screen.<br /><br />I love it!
0062127241|3.0|First off, I've been a Who fan since before Tommy was released.  I like the music.  Pete is one of the all time best songwriters - his music is complex, rocks when it needs to, and the lyrics convey real emotion.  So I was going to read this book one way or the other.  I haven't read any of the knock-off Who books.<br /><br />I got some insight into what the recording process is like, both artistically and from the business side.  It was interesting to see what the dynamics were in and around the band.  But Mr. Townshend comes across as a vain, selfish, generally unlikable guy.  I have to say I didn't feel quite that strongly about him until I got to the acknowledgements, at the very end (after the index, where you might miss them).  He spends pages on his friends, parents, children, girlfriends, current partner, but he does not mention his ex-wife.  I thought that was telling.<br /><br />Re: the book itself - Mr. Townshend is a good writer, as you would expect him to be.  There were a number of chapters where he states (and I paraphrase) \\"...and then I bought a bigger boat/new house/new recording console...\\" so many times it lost meaning.  He really did come across as a spoiled rock star, which leads me to the title of my review.  I'm not sure what he was trying to accomplish here.  Maybe get things off his chest?  He didn't seem like he strongly regretted many of his actions?  Maybe to really really (really) make sure that we all know he really wasn't viewing child pornography, which I don't think he was.  In the end, it was probably just to satisfy the advance he had gotten for writing the book (we hear that theme a lot too.)<br /><br />In summary, this was a good read but in a way I'm sorry I read it.  It definitely made me feel sad for the people around him, and I am always going to hear his music a little differently now.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love \\"Pinterest\\"!!! I find it interesting, entertaining, and informative. It is definitely a go to site for almost anything you can imagine!!!
1878424319|5.0|This remains a \\"must have\\" for anyone, of any faith, on a spiritual journey. Insightful and thought provoking. Great for recovery discussion groups.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I couldn't put it down, it was that good. I finished it quickly because I had to read \\"just one more chapter\\" all the time and before I know it...the end. It's going to be a long wait until the third one is released.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is one of my favorites. It will make you think and it is hard to put down once you start.
B008QTVNUI|1.0|The storyline is interesting and the acting is adequate. However the graphic nudity, explicit sex, and filthy language made me feel like I was watching a porn movie.  I had to turn it off halfway through the 2nd show. I could not recommend this show to anyone I actually cared about.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|like it a lot could have a faster regent on coins.  neat concept for a game. wouldn't buy coins though
0061992860|5.0|The book has very good content and information. The plants images are plenty of color and useful to identify better each of them. It gather most of the information that needs to be known for basic survivcal situations and how to improve crafts on different conditions. Compared with the official Military guides, this books has anything you might need. Good purchase.
B005HEY4CY|4.0|Voyager's two-parters are required viewing when trekking through the show. 'Flesh & Blood' strengthens this rule.<br /><br />'Flesh & Blood' felt like a conclusion (or perhaps, resolution) to the Doctor's long journey to relevance with everyone on Voyager. Sure, they came to accept him as one of the crew around season 3, but it never really felt written in stone. With the Doc presented with the choice of being with his own kind or staying loyal to his family (Voyager), the show puts all the cards on the table and really asks if Janeway has come to see the Doctor as a person.<br /><br />This episode is worth the journey, as Janeway makes the situation clear with the Doctor about what he is and what he means to the crew. It's a really poignant moment for the show.<br /><br />I'm focusing on this one aspect because 'Flesh & Blood' is rich with topics to talk about and analyze. One Amazon review wouldn't be able to cover it all.
B008U7ZPHS|5.0|Once more, Rick Riordan manages to make us delve in ancient history and forget our world, I recommend this novel for any person who likes or even dislikes reading. Simply Amazing:!
B005HEX0H4|3.0|Ensign Harry Kim gets a lot of flack for being mostly useless after the 4th season of Voyager. When you add in the rumors of Garrett Wang's ensign originally being the one chosen to leave after the arrival of Seven of Nine (with the maybe-could-have-been-more-interesting Kes getting the boot instead), it's easy to give the guy a hard time.<br /><br />I like to think of it like this. As a television character to watch, he's dead weight, but if the dude was real and I had a dope job on Federation starship, Harry would make a great roommate. He's a nice guy, who works hard, and can be down on his luck with the ladies. I know several guys like this and I call them my friends. This works in real life, but as a multidimensional character with an arc, Harry is just flat.<br /><br />`Nightingale' gives Wang a chance this season to stretch Harry out and for the most part, I enjoyed it. Seeing Harry overextend himself and then man-up as a captain was a fine change of pace from taking pot shots from Tom. It's an interesting glance at what Harry could have been if Voyager had adopted serialized storytelling more openly.<br /><br />When it comes down to it, if you like Harry, don't skip this episode. If not, then move along.<br /><br />Positive Points<br /><br />- If Harry ever did get his own command, having Seven of Nine as his first officer would be pretty boss. The friendship that has developed between them (since the initial awkwardness) I've grown to really like.<br /><br />- Voyager planet-side and being overhauled. I just like seeing starships getting fixed. Shouldn't this happen more often with the amount of light-years its chalked up?<br /><br />Negative Points<br /><br />- More aliens who are nice, then turn out to be uncompromising jerks.<br /><br />- The Nightingale's design could have been more interesting.
B0055MBQOM|5.0|I've put off doing the whole color calibration thing for quite a while. Used a Spyder a few years ago and  didn't like the results. With the purchase of a 27\\" iMac, I decided I needed to try again. The ColorMunki had a great rebate, and that tipped the favor over. I'm sure the newer Spyder4 is just as good, but with this, I was very pleased. I'm not sure why I put it off as long as I did. If you shoot for clients, and you don't calibrate, you're missing the boat. The ColorMunki was incredibly easy and intuitive. Get one!
B0006IIKS0|4.0|In 2001, shortly after the departure of Jason Newstead, filmmakers Bruce Sinofsky and Joe Berlinger began shooting a documentary of heavy metal icons Metallica, at a most critical juncture, in their then 20 year history together.  The result, Some Kind Of Monster (2004), often has the character of a therapy session, as it follows how James Hetfield, Kirk Hammett, and Lars Ulrich, confronted their internal issues head on, and attempted to come to terms and resolve them.  Through frustration, anguish, and the brink of despair, Metallica regrouped and recorded the [[ASIN:B00008OWZG St. Anger]] album, emerged from a trial by fire, with a clearer understanding of who they are, and a renewed resolve to move forward together, with new band member Robert Trujillo.  Provided with unprecedented access, the film contains some remarkably candid footage, and provides one of the most revealing in depth looks at any rock band.<br /><br />Reportedly dissatisfied with his role in Metallica, it still came as a surprise, when after 14 years, bassist Jason Newstead decided to quit Metallica.  To help them get through the crisis, \\"performance enhancement coach\\" Phil Towle was brought in to provide \\"guidance\\" to the band.  With producer Rob Rock, filling in on bass, the band begins to record a new album.<br /><br />The documentary begins around this point, with the band adjusting to Newstead's departure and playing with Rob Rock.  It is a completely new experience for everyone, as with \\"Dr. Phil\\" fully involved, group discussions, and the expression of \\"feelings\\", are now a regular part of the process.  The band is also taking a more open approach to songwriting.  Metallica begins to hammer out some songs, but during this time James Hetfield checks into rehab to deal with alcohol abuse issues, leaving the band's future in limbo.<br /><br />During the 11 months Hetfield is in rehab, communication with him is limited, and all work on the album stops.  The documentary looks at Hetfield's past excesses, speculates on the future of the band, and takes a closer look at Hammett and Ulrich.  One of the film's most impactful segments features a meeting between Ulrich, Towle, and former Metallica guitarist Dave Mustaine, who was fired from the band for his abuse of alcohol.  Although Mustaine found great success with Megadeth, he still harbors deep feelings of hurt.<br /><br />Hetfield eventually returns, but the guitarist being able to work only between 12 noon and 4pm, causes problems.  Much of the film in concerned with the conflict between Ulrich and Hetfield, and the new arrangement aggravates the friction which had always existed.  Although Ulrich is prone to emotional outbursts, for the most part Hetfield is remarkably calm, although he often seems unaware of how his needs, affects others.  Kirk Hammett and Rob Rock, generally try not to take sides, and attempt to help the process along, although both seem to become increasingly frustrated, as the constant talk about feelings wears thin after a while.  Although he apparently has the full support and respect of the band, Phil Towle's role is an intriguing one, as it is seldom clear when progress is being made, and some of his actions seem questionable.<br /><br />Other featured subjects include Lars Ulrich's sale of his multi-million dollar art collection, the legal battle against Naptser, Jason Newstead's post-Metallica activities, and events involving fans.  After holding auditions, Robert Trujillo from Ozzy Osbourne's band, is selected as Metallica's new bass player.  Hoping not to repeat the past, the other members fully embrace Robert, as a renewed Metallica proceeds forward.<br /><br />While interesting, particularly from a voyeuristic standpoint, and a winner of various critical awards, at 140 minutes, Some Kind of Monster could be a bit too much for the casual fan, as the band's dysfunctionality dominates most of the production, and making music becomes secondary.  Although groundbreaking in 2004, the proliferation of reality type programming since then, may have lessened \\"Monster's\\" impact today.<br /><br />Sinofsky and Berlinger shot a ton of material which was not used, a fraction of which appears on Disc 2.  Some of the interesting and colorful stuff here includes an \\"alternate\\" take of the conversation between Mustaine and Ulrich, Ulrich visiting his childhood home in Denmark, and the band and the filmmakers doing publicity for the movie.  Metallica remains one of the most influential bands in rock, and were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2009.04, the proliferation of reality type programming since then, may have lessened \\"Monster's\\" impact today.<br /><br />Sinofsky and Berlinger shot a ton of material which was not used, a fraction of which appears on Disc 2.

0374214913|5.0|I've been keeping track of Robin Sloan for a while now. He apparently lives in San Francisco when he's not on the Internets. Robin wrote and posted online a short story called Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore, back in 2009. I read it shortly thereafter, and was greatly pleased by the characters, the settings, and the plotting. All-in-all, one of the tightest, shiniest short stories I've read in a long, long time.<br /><br />So, when Robin headed down the Kickstarter path with his first dead trees work, the novella entitled Annabel Scheme, I jumped on the bandwagon, and supported his effort with real moola. It's good to be a patron of the Arts*.<br /><br />Recently, all this attention and excitement got Robin into the eyes of a publisher. The opportunity blossomed, and expressed itself as a novel-length version of that original short I loved so much. Putting glow-in-the-dark book stacks on the slipcover is genius, by the way.<br /><br />Last night, when I should have put the book down and turned out the lights, I carried on reading through to the end of this wonderful tale. It's like Robin took the perfect little doll house version of the tale, and scaled it up into a proper people-scale edifice worthy of living in for a while. I can hang out in different rooms, and see many more wondrous sights from all the new angles and perspectives that the more capacious novel provides.<br /><br />Our hero is still diffident, his girl is still a genius, and Penumbra still is ... but the horizons are much further out, and the tale's changed to accommodate the expansion. New characters are woven in and out of the fabric of the story - you can see the short story in there still, but it's got a lot of new friends. Some of them are likeable, some less so, much like the folks in all of our lives. The blurring and bending of reality at the intersection of old technology (books and moveable type) and new technology (the Internet and extreme-scale computational power) is more pointedly the focus of the story, now, and that's no bad thing. It hits a demographic that's likely to work really well for Robin's writing career.<br /><br />One more thing about Penumbra's: it's a good world, too. Robin has room to grow more stories in that space, if he wants. Annabel Scheme is in a related universe, but only just. I look forward to his next work, and the next. Does Robin mind if I put such expectations on his time? I hope not.<br /><br />Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore. Robin Sloan. (Farrar, Straus and Giroux: New York. 2012). Highly Recommended!<br /><br />*  Patron of the Arts - I've been supporting authors and musicians, mostly, with my entertainment dollars. Just because something can be had for free (like the PDF edition of Annabel Scheme), doesn't mean I don't go buy the Kindle version instead. Okay, not true - I got the signed dead tree edition from Robin via the Kickstarter. Today, driving home, iTunes offered up Amanda Palmer, then Zoe Keating ... two more artists I've been paying as directly as possible. I want them to keep working, which means mortgage and food and such, so supporting artists I love is important to me. I hope it is for (some of) you, too!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This was the best trilogy of books that I have ever read! You must read all three books to see how much Anna brings out the good in Christian.  In the first book he seems like a real monster, a real pig!  After reading the second book, you start to see that there is a good man deep down inside. He was so messed up by two women in his life, but Anna brings out the best in him!!  This is a very exciting series of books and a real must read...

I found the story teller perspective an interesting novelty, and the way it jumped between different time periods was well done.<br /><br />I found the concept of describing the impact of 9/11 from two different perspectives interesting and quite clever.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|Let me just start by saying I preordered this book. When I woke up at 5 AM on the day of its release to find a confirmation of my order, I was slightly ecstatic to say the least.<br />Unfortunately it's not a long book and when I got to 90% I did what was inevitably impossible, I TRIED to slow down.<br />It was an emotional roller coaster. You want to trust Gideon and believe in him and at times it gets difficult and you absolutely hate him.<br />I already preordered the next book and am sure I am in for an excruciatingly long 2 1/2 months. Hopefully she doesn't actually end it with 3. I get too much joy out of these twos crazy romance.

B007OXWWX4|5.0|I play guitar, and love slash's style. Always have. This cd is amazing. From top to bottom every song just rocks. Pure R & F'n R the whole way through. Myles' vocals are great, Todd Kearns bass lines are perfect, and Brent just ties it all together with his drumming. Must buy cd for rock and roll fans, as well as any music appreciator out there.

B007HU7NBK|5.0|This is a great read for any fan of Duran Duran and John Taylor. I preordered the download and started reading it at midnight, Pacific Time. I couldn't  put it down until I HAD to go to sleep at 4 am. I finished it this afternoon.<br /><br />John's writing is very engaging and honest. He has a flair for getting straight to the point that is unexpected and refreshing. He also had the sense to know who would be reading this book (fans) and didn't go over what were already well known details of the early years. Instead, he brings us his eyes, his perception, and his story in a way that is brutally honest and a little more than critical of his years in addiction.Yes, as others have said, he doesn't dish down and dirty details but I'm okay with that. I thought he was too classy to go down that road and and didn't expect him to talk poorly of anyone in the band. Perhaps that's because he truly takes full responsibility for his own actions and has the compassion to know that his perspective was the only truth he knew to write about.<br /><br />And we learn plenty of truth about his downward spiral into cocaine, alcohol and fame addiction. It was a long ride for John. Those who had similar experiences in the early 80's might be surprised that it took him so long to get to rehab. He stayed in that bubble for a very long time. I'm glad he made it out.<br /><br />I was getting a bit worried when I hit 60% done and he was still in 1985. I wanted to know about the years when he left the band and worried he would completely skim over it. And he does do that just a little but somehow he covered just enough that I did not feel lacking when I was done. I have been waiting for this book since early this year so I had built up some expectations. But as John reiterates from recovery, expectations are just disappointments under construction. Go in reading this book with that in mind and you will find an excellent memoir.
B00908DDZM|5.0|It's really good.  I often lose interest in hip-hop/rap because the genre has become so drowned in repetitive chorus garbage regarding wealth and women, of course using more derogatory terms. I usually end up listening to tracks from the 90's or earlier 00's rather than what's available today.  It's nice to hear something new, fresh, and something that still retains a good amount of class while staying catchy.  Some of the tracks are very inspirational.  When I like an album, I usually select one song and keep it on repeat.  However, I've had the entire album on repeat for a couple days now.  This album is damn good.  I'm hoping this review stirs a couple sales for Sir Macklemore and Sir Lewis.  I can't wait to hear what else these guys can come up with.<br /><br />The one thing that I hope for is a physical version of the Explicit Copy.  I'm more of a FLAC kinda guy.<br /><br />*edit*<br />Just found out you can get the physical copy of the Explicit Version only from the Mackelmore website.  It's about twice the price, but I still think it's worth it for the amount of stuff they give you!<br /><br />Don't forget to get their other album THE LANGUAGE OF MY WORLD from their website, it's no longer available on amazon.  Also, The VS. EP is available for free online, which is already awesome as it is.

B007TK77QE|5.0|Casual Vacancy was a page turner from the beginning. The characters are well rounded and engaging. I feel sure I have met many of them in my time. For the people who are critical, I suspect you need to move on from Harry Potter.  Yes - they were fantastic books, but so is this. I'd say this is neither better nor worse than Harry Potter - just different. JK truly is talented to be able to write such diverse works - no one trick pony.

I have been collecting Walt Disney movies for many years beginning when my children were young and now that I have grandchildren and technology has upgraded from VHS to DVD & BlueRay I too was forced to upgrade my collection of wholesome family Disney Movies collection. The Princess and the Frog is a winner in my opinion and my children & grandchildren love the New Orleans & Cajun background and wonderful storyline and music/songs. With the Hoodoo, Voodoo and light comedy is a great addition to our family's collection to enjoy for many years.

B000FVQM2Y|5.0|I really can't say enough good things about this film. It is so incredibly clever by blending noir with High-school drama. It thus creates a sort of \\"milk and cookies\\" noir genre, which I find absolutely fascinating. The story is intriguing and the script is airtight. If you are a movie fan of any kind, then you owe it to yourself to watch this film as soon as possible.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I read this book the day after it came out, and I loved it. Honestly, the only bad thing is the massive cliffhanger at the end, but that's to be expected. Other than that, one of the best books he's written, honestly.

B007THA4FI|4.0|Ok... I have to admit, I bought the book because of the author.  In reality, I don't usually read books based in England.  However, I have to say it captured my attention and kept it throughout the book.  The characters were typical \\"little burg\\" mentality... and they were charming to say the least.  But the end... the end... came so abruptly, I felt like I had just walked off a cliff... no warning.. no logical end to the book.  (Hopefully, this is the author's way of telling us there will be a sequel.  So in short, it was a good read until the abrupt ending...
1451683405|3.0|I'm glad Mr. Harris is writing about a fascinating topic, and for that I gave this book three stars. However, it seems he is suggesting that if you cannot create something out of nothing, if all your brain can do is process hundreds if not thousands (or millions) of pieces of data while consciously (and subconsciously) deliberating on a subject, then you are fooling yourself into believing you have free will. In other words, if you are not the creator of the universe ie. God, then you are a very complex automaton. This definition of free will is setting the bar way too high in my opinion.<br /><br />Perhaps a better angle on the question is not to compare ourselves with God, but to compare ourselves with other animals, with respect to the comparative abilities to control and modify natural instincts, and to combine separate and distinct ideas into one. Our ability to recreate time and space within our minds, to accumulate knowledge, and look at questions from different perspectives is something that is truly new and unique on this planet, perhaps even outside our planet.<br /><br />I admit that I have tried to create a new time and space continuum and have failed miserably, but I am aware of many of my most basic instincts, and can, with some effort, modify them into something more productive on a long-term basis. We are also able to combine two admittedly pre-existing concepts into a new one. Yes, it is a combinatorial action and not creating something entirely new from scratch.  But this ability is kind of miraculous if you ask me, and puts us into a new category of consciousness. Think about the crazy colors of lipstick that are available.  I can't prove it, but it's a good guess that some of these colors were never personally witnessed in nature by the person who made them, a few of them may even not exist in a natural state. But because we understand that combining two or more natural colors in a certain ratio makes something that that person has never seen, wehave created something that didn't exist before, even though its components did. Same with ideas. So if the current definition of free will cannot take these situations into account, then maybe we need a new definition of free will.  Perhaps, like our higher consciousness, free will is so ubiquitous that we cannot see something that is always right in front of us.
B008GVD6D8|5.0|Simply, Loved it!<br />Couldn't put it down. I was getting anxious to think it was ending soon. Smart writing made me believe I  knew these characters. Can't wait until number 3
B008O9V4C2|5.0|This is better than \\"Morph the cat\\" imo.  I've listened to it 3 times and it keeps getting better, just like all Fagen's music.  If you're a dan fan you will definitely enjoy.<br />Hopefully the guys will reunite someday and give us all another Steely Dan disc too.<br /><br />Update: 11/17/2012 -I've listened to this disc about 20 times and it is positively infectious. I can't even decide which songs I like best but slinky thing, new breed, miss marlene, and good stuff are all bouncing around in my head long after I stop the music. This one is a classic, not to be missed.<br /><br />I'm scratching my head over the negative reviews posted here. Everyone is entitled to their opinions I suppose. Mine is if you're a fan of dan you must get this.

B0099116AY|5.0|It seems that Amazon is up to their usual tricks with reviews of this item posted before the item even exists for purchase.  Of course that makes it impossible for any reviewer to properly review the item that will actually be sold since those items are NOT. YET. AVAILABLE. for purchase or review.  Please take that into consideration if you see a bunch of reviews of this item and if you really want to know if the Blu-ray or DVD is worth spending your money on, then please read carefully and find reviews here that tell you about specifics of the product as it will be sold, packaged, etc.<br /><br />Now, with that out of the way, this is a film that I sincerely hope gets treated nicely when it is released on Blu-ray (and DVD).  I will say that in looking at the current specifications, I'm a bit underwhelmed and somewhat disappointed that this isn't promised as a Blu-ray and DVD combo, and also frustrated that, at least so far, it only mentions the frustrating and very disappointing UltraViolet Digital Copy.  My own preference would be for an Amazon digital copy or an iSomething digital copy that I can use on my pad or tablet device or my fruity TV player device.  UltraViolet has been a frustrating adventure indeed as the account creation/log-in requirements for the various UltraViolet partners leads to a confusing mess of code redemptions that seem to be for no purpose other than to generate statistics of customers that don't even bother to redeem these digital copies (so that the studios can cry about how people just don't want these things).<br /><br />Personally I like the Blu-ray/DVD combo packages since it means I can take my copies of films to my parents home to share with them without fearing that they don't yet have a Blu-ray player.  I know there are plenty of people that feel that the combo packages, as well as the digital copies, mean that these products are priced higher than they need to be and I understand the desire for single-disc movie only (\\"no frills\\") packages that would theoretically be less expensive.  In reality though, it seems that the studios are bound and determined to put out packages that will retail at a certain price point and no amount of consumer reaction will change their minds.<br /><br />Anyway, let me move on to a short, but hopefully fairly well spoiler free, look at this film and get into why I rate the film as highly as I do.<br /><br />Over the years it seems that Hollywood could rightfully be accused of mostly ignoring and failing to target more mature (read that as code for \\"older\\") audiences.  For the most part, if it doesn't bleed, blow-up spectacularly, lead to uncontrollable laughter or other reactions from younger audiences then the hopes of seeing a film made and released seems to be nil.  Hollywood concentrates on creating films that appeal to the seemingly all important 18-35 year range of consumers while occasionally creating content for families with youngsters and once in a great while creating films that have appeal to more mature members of society.<br /><br />Older actors and actresses often lament the lack of opportunity to continue to work in the film industry, though they are sometimes offered roles as parents or senior statesmen, mentors or other similar roles in films that skew towards younger generations.  Once and in while someone comes along with a film such as this one that offers prime roles to these older and well established actors and actresses and if we're all lucky those roles are ones that offer these stars a chance to shine.<br /><br />Streep and Jones are certainly accomplished movie stars, each with an impressive body of work to look back on.  Having seen this film, I'd say that their performances here are every bit as good as any they've logged previously as they both make the characters they are playing here incredibly believable and incredibly sympathetic as the audience is introduced to the lives of two halves of a couple that has drifted apart overtheir years together.  Streep's Kay is living out her later years going through the routine that has become her life.  Jones' Arnold starts his day with the usual breakfast that Kay prepares for him and then proceeds to go to work only to come back home and eventually fall asleep in front of the TV showing the Golf Channel or an ESPN type broadcast.  Neither seems to be romantically interested in the other except for perhaps an fairly emotionless kiss before leaving for work, or... hmm, maybe Kay really is interested in more as the audience is shown Kay's nervous glances and mannerisms that show that she has something she wants to talk about with Arnold but just doesn't seem to be able to get to.  When we're shown Kay reviewing a brochure for a couples counseling/therapy series, it becomes obvious to the audience what is really on Kay's mind.<br /><br />These events were all \\"spoiled\\" for potential movie goers in the trailers and advertising leading up to the theatrical release of this film.  What wasn't spoiled was what happens when the couple inevitably goes on to the counseling with Steve Carrell's Dr. Feld (at least not terribly spoiled).  What unfolds is an incredibly believable and heart tugging look at this mature couple and the story of how they arrived at this point in their life and more importantly what they can do to get the old magic back, if that is even possible.<br /><br />Both Kay and Arnold react in ways that are tender, touching and sometimes outrageously funny.  Seeing the story unfold on the big screen where wife 2.0 and I enjoyed a screening with a sell-out crowd led to moments of laughter as well as the proverbial \\"awwwwwww\\" or other similar reactions.  Clearly all of the parties involved here, from the screen writer, the director and the actors, all cooperated nicely to produce a film that hit the right notes and should appeal to a wide range of consumers.  With that said, this film is one that likely will go ignored by much of the under 40 crowd.  They'll likely look at this as a film that their parents might enjoy, but not so much be one they'd like see, at least not until they too are balding or graying and feeling a little more mature themselves.  Sadly those that take that approach will be missing a gem of film.<br /><br />One final (for now, as I may come back and update this review when the Blu-ray is released and I have the copy I'm going to order in hand) note here -- this is not necessarily a film that would appeal to family viewers.  I'm not sure that I'd like to sit and watch this film with my daughter, and I'm sure that wife 2.0 wouldn't want to watch it with hers, though I suppose they might surprise me.  Sitting down as a family though, and watching it together as parents and children, would be, well, awkward.  The same could be said if I sat down to watch this with my own parents, though I did highly recommend to my own parents that they catch this film in theaters while they could (and they did, and they reported back they enjoyed it immensely).<br /><br />Actually one last thought here (even as I said \\"one final note\\" above), as I was thinking of another film that I recently enjoyed watching on Blu-ray that also involved a more mature cast.  If you are searching for something that would appeal to an more mature audience, then give serious consideration to [[ASIN:B005S9EJ46 The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel [Blu-ray]]].  It is definitely worth the viewing, just as Hope Springs was.their years together.  Streep's Kay is living out her later years going through the routine that has become her life.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|After hearing all the talk and everyone woman I know telling me I should read the books, I finally broke down and read book 1 on a girls' cruise when one of them gave it to me.  While I was glad to know I wasn't the only one of the group who hadn't read it, I can't believe I waited so long.  I thought the books were great.
B007MB5OCE|3.0|Very cute and clever.  Love the way he walked through and influenced history and never took sides.  Made me smile.

You get three good sizes.  Nice detail.<br /><br />So while it has no real educational value, doesn't do anything so is, I guess, not very 'fun', it is well made and well Cthulhu.  So don't anger the Great Old Ones and go on and get it!

0765322889|3.0|Before you read Gardens of the Moon you might want to ask yourself about your motivations for reading.<br />Many people like to curl up with a relaxing book at the end of a long day. This is definitely not that book.<br />There is another class of people, those who read to have new experiences. This book is for you.<br />Some seek both. Again, you will not find it here.<br />Others still seek to connect intimately with relatable characters. The cast here is too vast for such an experience.<br /><br />Gardens of the Moon is admittedly confusing throughout the beginning and middle. This is due in part to scant exposition, but it is also because the author purposely remains vague about descriptions of the world and its magic. He leaves many details only partially drawn, allowing the reader to imagine much of the world on his/her own, or simply hazard a guess.<br />Another point of confusion, can arise from the wide cast of characters. If you are not good with names, like myself, you will struggle with this book.<br /><br />Erikson is a master of words. His writing is generally good, sometimes truly amazing, though at times his sentence structure can be cumbersome. But he is very much a non-traditional storyteller. Many would call him a poor storyteller. You could say it is a matter of style. Erikson is more of an impressionist than a traditionalist when it comes to storytelling.<br /><br />If you are looking for something new and engaging, try Gardens of the Moon.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Gripping subject matter, I find this glimpse into the dom/sub relationship. Read it in two days, I hated sleeping, eating and going to work because I couldnt read! Sexual details are explained in a tame matter, don't be discouraged with the whole \\"mommy porn\\" desciption!
159102594X|5.0|I have to admit, I didn't expect much from this book when I heard about it.  Yes, everyone and their mom was recommending it but it seemed so trite.  Barbarians, wizards, maimed torturers,  cocky good-looking snobs, it's not exactly new.  About 10% of the way in though, Mr. Abercrombie had completely changed my mind and slapped me around a bit for even thinking that way in the first place.  The book is a masterful work of fiction and Mr. Abercrombie has earned his place with flying colors, especially since I'm under the impression this is one of his weaker works.  (I have been told the later work \\"The Heroes\\" is one of the best fantasy novels ever written so I look forward to that).  Logen Ninefingers is a wonderful character who somehow is able to angst while not being angst, and his confused reactions to the main city of the Union (I forget the name to be honest...) are some of my favorite parts of the book.  Ferro is absolutely brilliant and perfectly destroys the horrible and actually, in my opinion,  disgraceful and insulting trope of the \\"I'm distrustful but I'll trust you because you're the hero\\" thing that is so prevalent in lesser works.  Plus she reminds me of Jack from Mass Effect and I adore Jack.  The Dogman parts were a bit iffy to me, but I understood their purpose and the scene at the end of that storyline is actually rather touching considering who they are.  Jezal was interesting, I hated him at first but as time went on.....I still hated him but I found him enjoyable to read, especially his \\"romance\\" with Ardee West.  Of course, none of this compares to what may be one of my favorite fantasy characters of all time  Sand Dan Glotka,  a man who was once a grand hero who ends up becoming a broken, pained and cynical man who provides some of the best lines and characterization in the entire novel.  All in all, it's a wonderful book and a must read for anybody.  Yeah, not just fantasy fans.  Everyone should read this,  it has action, drama, horror, romance, suspense, tragedy, comedy.  I eagerly await a chance to pick up the next two books in the trilogy and Before They Were Hanged, along with the upcoming Red Country (I already have the Heroes but I haven't touched it due to not wanting to read them out of order.)

0292701934|5.0|The book I bought very much acomplished my expectations.  What´s so interesting of AVEDON AT WORK is the purpose of the book to show something of The American West without romanticising beauty or myths. It´s so real that it´s like being there but you´re not sure if you want to be there.  Thanks.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I really like playing this game. The graphics and sound are very polished. I can't wait for more free levels
B007QPFGJW|5.0|Jo Nesbo's latest is another fascinating trail of crime starring a dried-out, sober Harry Hole.  In short order, Nesbo plunges the reader into Olso's drug scene, where Harry encounters a tangled web of drug-related death,, implicating the son of Harry's true love.  There are some real surprising twists and turns, but what drove me to keep reading was the author's ability to realize Harry's emotional connections while remaining true to the essentially flawed character that is Harry Hole.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Great book! Same quality as all of his other books! Even with different points of views from the characters, the author developed the story well.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|this app is visually stunning and the &quot;plot&quot; makes you feel like you are accomplishing something. Beyond that, it is a match three game. I'm enjoying it!
B007SGM084|2.0|I began reading the first of the three books with great anticipation, expecting exciting, titillating situations within an engrossing plot line. I kept reading and waiting, and the repetition became so plodding I dreaded picking it up again. I probably won't read the last two. Just can't seem to care how many of the same scenes get tweaked to present as new and amazing situations for innocent little Ana. I'd give away the last two but they're on my kindle.
B008FQ1O1K|5.0|if you love mitch alboms books you will love this one too . thought provoking and well written as you would expect from this incredibly talented story teller.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved it and can't wait to read the other two books. I hope they are as great as the first one.
1938469003|3.0|I have been homebrewing for decades and was hoping for actual recipies from commercial brewers but the hop schedules are silly. What am I to make of \\"use 30% Chinook in the boil, 30% Columbus at 30 minutes and 40% Simcoe at knockout\\" Unless you have the total amout of hops used this is worthless information, and how does adding 12 ounces of Goldings hops at the beginning of the boil (5 gallon batch) only give you 70 IBU's??? That is just from the first recipe...The history is fine but the recipes are horrible.
B00002SWEM|5.0|This is the best music DVD of Cuban music from Buena Vista Social Club Band. It has the original members who are no longer with us! A real treat!

0439023521|5.0|There are few books...much less series of books...that I truly enjoy.  This was probably my first actually.  The story line was absolutely terrific, the characters were wonderful and engaging and the action was fantastic.  LOVED IT from the beginning of the first book the the end of the last book!
B005LAIHGI|4.0|The Dictator was okay and it was pretty funny I guess Baron Cohen is a fairly amusing fellow he reminds me of The Marx Brothers or Cheech and Chong in some ways. I personally found \\"Borat\\" much funnier than \\"The Dictator\\" if I show someone how funny Baron Cohen is, I put \\"Borat\\" in my DVD player,...it just seems much funnier. Did not like any of Cohen's Rapper type films,..just not amusing. Yet I feel \\"The Dictator\\" has it's merits of ridicule of that type of government or the lack thereof. Although Baron Cohen appears to be making light of his Jewishness it always come through as just that, just like the Marx Brothers did. May watch again.
B00992CF6W|5.0|kip Kennedy thinks bullshit is better then minecraft why minecraft is way better then bullshit. I love u mojang and Jeb and notch u guys r boss.
B006HGXGWU|4.0|\\"Take Shelter\\" was a fairly decent end days kind of film. For some reason I thought Midnight Shamalian had something to do with it,...the main actor seemed pretty normal up to a point and then he has these morbid dreams and goes off the deep end in a survival and paranoid way. Alienates his friends and wife,...they all think he is going nuts, and you would believe it. He \\"borrows\\" earth moving tools from work, uses his friends, borrows money from bank, loses job, seems insane right to the end when the storm he worries about appears. The movie maker SHOULD HAVE put more of the Storm of Horror in the main part of this movie. Left me with a feeling of \\"What happened?\\" It is an okay film.
B005IQZB14|5.0|This book was much more than i expected. i am rather anti-oprah, but i am now a believer.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book and recommend it to anyone irrespective of traditional genre type that someone reads.
B000O78KW4|2.0|Same old formula. . .<br /><br />Yes, it's full of action and stunts, but once you have seen one, it's easy to get tired of:<br /><br />o Bruce Willis making faces and cursing in phony frustration<br />o blurred images to generate phony excitement<br />o lights that shine directly into the camera<br />o Willis armed with a pistol and a handful of cartridges confronting a whole shipful of heavily armed terrorists

B001AITH50|2.0|Trying to understand why this movie is/was so popular... must be just the Cruise/Pitt/Banderas factor? If you're looking for vampires different from Twilight, I guess this might be for you.
B00000F1D3|5.0|I LOVE IT! 14 years later and still great.  \\"Believe\\" is a must have for fans of Cher and those who like late 90's early '00's dance music. Every single song is great. Just wish there were more songs on the CD. :)<br />I love to listen to this before I go on a long run.

0867342218|1.0|Very disappointed that it was not the book...it was a dumb activity book that gives you activities to do after you read the book well great if I actually had the book... So disappointed I don't know that I can shop Amazon anymore with this crap happening
B0053JJLLC|4.0|This book was classic Michael Crichton with a twist. A bit predictable but entertaining nonetheless. I would recommend this for anyone who is a Crichton fan.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|If you enjoyed Forrest Gump you will like this book.<br /><br />The premis is the same. Allan the main character is not the brightest bulb in the box but is thrown by fate and timing into situations where he meets and \\"helps\\" , Presidents, Revoloutionaries, Scientists, Heros and villans as well as criminals.<br />As a result he is part of life threatening as well as personaly financialy enriching experiences and takes part in creating history.<br /><br />The perspective the Author puts on the Historical events Allan is part of is both entertaining and thought provokeing.<br /><br />You will enjoy following Allan and the varied cast of characters he comes across both famouse and infamouse.
B00007E7K0|5.0|I lost my cap a few months ago and bought these 2 days ago and just got them today. It's the same exact caps that came with the kit lens. Its made from Canon and fits great. If you lost your caps and want to buy a new one. Your at the right place.
B009GENZ12|5.0|The Tall Man is an origional thriller that keeps you guessing, when you thing you know who the bad guy is your wrong, it keeps you guessing untill the end. If you like departing from the origional style Hollywood from of plot this is a movie you will want to see.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book was a well awaited next installment for the series. It gave the reader exactly what they wanted to see yet left so many mysteries and curiosities that are yet to be discovered. I cannot wait for the next book and to see what happens to Percy, Anna Beth and the gang. It is going to be an epic adventure and I cannot wait to see how it pans out. I recommend the Heroes of Olympus series to anyone looking for a series filled with adventure, intrigue and strategy.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I WAS NOT looking for a Harry Potter repeat but what was described as a \\"dark comedy\\". The whole book would be better as a TV show like \\"Eastenders\\". I read & read waiting for something to happen, but read in vain. While well written it was very dull. It did make a point about poverty & Rowling's charitable cause of helping poor children & promoting literacy, but offered little else. The characters were well presented but the book as a whole can be missed. If you want to read it borrow it from your local library, J.K. Rowling & her publishers have enough money, save yours. For \\"dark comedy\\" I would encourage everyone to read Terry Pratchett's Discworld books. Best written satire on the planet!

B009JEM1PK|5.0|First, the caution.  Don't buy the MP3 version of the album from Amazon.  At least not until they update it.  Look at track #8.  Amazon only has it at 2:51 and that is what you get if you download it.  The track is really 8:39.  Also, there is a bonus track available if you buy elsewhere - Track 9, My Faults are Your Reward.  It is worth getting.<br /><br />Now for the album. . . .I am a longtime MDB fan, going back to As the Flower Withers.  I like all of their albums, though tend to prefer the earliest two and then the most recent string of albums.  By now you are either into MDB or you are not.  If you like them, this one doesn't disappoint.  The one-two punch of Track 1 and Track 2 are worth it alone.  Track 1 (Kneel Till Doomsday) has their best death/grind breakdown since \\"Sear Me\\" from As the Flower Withers, making for a very tense song.  Then they move into Track 2 (The Poorest Waltz), which is a much lighter and melancholic, with some nice harmony work done with Aaron's voice.  These two songs are great complements to one another that really capture the full spectrum of MDB.  The rest of the album that follows is solid MDB at their best.<br /><br />And if you don't know MDB, they are one of the best playing the melodic/melancholic/atmospheric side of the doom spectrum (as opposed to the sludgey-stoner dimension).  Mostly clean, warbley vocals, interspersed with death growls (one of the best in the doom genre); slow, plodding, clean guitars that occasionally erupt with speed' complementary drum work (lots of rolls); all rounded out by a violin, organ, and other appropriate accompaniments.  If that's your thing, MDB are among the best at it and this album is as good as any a place to start.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book fit right in with all of Rick Riordan's books.  It was very good!  Now I'm waiting for the next one to come out.

B003N0XDT4|3.0|First I have to say that Fiio E7 certainly increases the quality of the music that I have played through it. The soundstage is much wider and vocal richer. However, the biggest flaw of Fiio E7 is that it actually does not adequately amplify the volume of the sound that a typical laptop lacks. The highest volume setting on my Fiio E-7 is only 5-10 % louder than the max volume from my laptop, which is nowhere near an ear-splitting level. The headphones I have used are ath m-50 and sennheiser hd 380 pro, both of which have pretty low impedance. This is quite frustrating when I really want to crank up the volume to enjoy some songs. I have heard this might be a common problem with USB-powered headphone dac/amplifier as it does not generate enough power to significantly boost the volume of the sound. I guess I have to search for an amplifier that runs on independent power supply.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|this game from the start had me addicted. love the challenges and the hidden object scenes. also the story line was well thought of. Can't g wait to start the second .

B008673ZAQ|4.0|I am enjoying this series so much.. I have to say I like this book better then Fifty Shades. I cant wait for the 3rd book to come out in December I read this book in 3 days and loved it. I highly recomment this book.
B0084IG8TM|2.0|I read the series and if I hadn't this movie would be a lot more confusing. There is no real explanation and character information. The books were much better and easier to understand what was going on. I wish we could have enjoyed more of the grandness of the game preparation. The transitions didn't work well and were too quick, but the movie seemed long because they dragged out scenes that made no sense to those who didn't read the book.
B000SEGUDE|2.0|Too much surrealism for my taste.  Unable to finish book.............unususal for me.  I was unable to relate to the characters in this story.

B008QTV3X0|5.0|When you combine the talents of Claire Danes, Mandy Patinkin, Damien Lewis and the slew of additional stars.......what do you get??  I'll tell you - excellent TV viewing - that's what you get.  Homeland deserved each and every Emmy it received.  I am glued to each and every episode; as a matter of fact, my only criticism is that each one isn't longer!  I was only able to rate it five stars but I would've given it ten.
B001I8A76A|5.0|I don't own all of P!nk's album, but of the 4-5 that I own, this is by far my favorite.  I own the CD, but was unable to find it, so when The Truth About Love was released and Amazon put a lot of P!nk MP3 downloads up for $5, I repurchased this.<br /><br />I love every track on this album.  P!nk's music is amazing.  My favorite songs are Glitter in the Air and Crystal Ball....but truly every song is great.  If you're a fan of P!nk and don't have this album, buy it.  You won't be disappointed!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This silly little game is addicting.  My only complaint is that getting coins can take too long causing me to lose interest.
B003MQLRSS|5.0|Little Women is about a time and a place that our generation knows nothing about.  I'm 36, and the world today is nothing like the world when Little Women was written.  It's a great story about a mother and her daughters, and their struggles and joys at a time when the country is at war and their father/husband must go off and fight.  The story is filled with happiness and sorrow, love and pain.
0307744434|2.0|What is wrong with me? Why can't I finish this book?? It's taken me 3 weeks to read 50 pages and I have yet to be pulled in. I know this book has rave reviews and I keep picking it back up to read some more hoping that it'll get interesting but it just doesnt.

B0058YPILY|5.0|Criminal Minds season 7 is just as good, if not better, than the first 6 seasons. I had no trouble ordering or receiving this DVD and it was at a great price. CM is a great show. It makes me aware that there are truly sick,sick people in this world and that we should all be smart about our surroundings. Trust your instincts!
0767803434|5.0|Air Force One is a good action movie with great actors.  It's a predictable movie, but still very fun to watch and pass the time.  If you're looking for a good family movie or are a strict parent with what your kids can watch then I highly recommend this movie.  There's mild violence and mild language, but still fun to watch and own.

B0011FTQ4O|5.0|Almost Famous is one of my favorite movies of all time.  I loved this movie when it first came out and thought it was really awesome.  After watching it a few times however I found myself asking myself questions about some of the movie.  My questions never bothered me for not getting answered, but then came the blu-ray edition with the director's cut on it.  I immediately bought this movie and watched the very awesome director's cut and all my questions were answered.  I'm very glad I can watch both versions, but I definitely prefer the director's cut over the original.  I wish they would show the director's cut on cable so others can enjoy it as much as I did.  I guess that's the perks of getting it on blu-ray though.  If you love this movie, but don't have a blu-ray player, go get one!  It's that awesome!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I absolutely love Rick Riordan's series. As a teacher, I would reccommend these books to any parent who wants their child to have a better grasp of Greek/Roman/Egyptian (Kane Chronicles) myths to better understand allusions in the future. I loved studying Greek and Roman mythology in school, but most of the myths are dryly written with no real excitement. Riordan's books are a fun, entertaining, and easy way for kids (and grown-ups who need a refresher, I personally LOVE reading his books) to learn the myths that commonly appear in literature. The Mark of Athena proves that Riordan's works just keep getting better and more exciting. Also, with the innocent love stories he throws into his series', these are not limited to boys. There is a lot of action and adventure, but the girls will love these too once they get to know the characters.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I already own Avatar and can actually convert my movies to 3d with my player, I just want to say if you're expecting fireworks like I was you will be let down.<br />I bought this 3d version thinking I would see things float out of the screen but I didn't.<br /><br />Avatar is a good movie, a great movie! If you own the dvd already and can convert it there's no since in buying this one too.<br />I have to admit I was upset, I had waited so long to really see an amazing 3D visual effects (Fireworks) and I saw what I had already converted on the one I owned before this, so it was a waist of my money.<br /><br />If you don't own it or can't convert 2D to 3D then it's a good buy.

Those are great.<br /><br />Ghost Rider 2 had just a few things wasn't what I was hoping for.<br /><br />Underworld 4 just a few things also.<br /><br />Parana 3DD it had allot of pop out effects as well as the first Parana<br /><br />Wrath of the titans was fairly good on the effects.<br /><br />John Carter an awesome movie but as far as 3D visual there were NO POP-OUTS or anything to come out of the screen.<br /><br />Transformers 4 if my memory serves me, I believe it had allot of 3D Visual effects.<br /><br />Sector 7, It's NOT IN ENGLISH, you have to read the movie not giving you the chance to really watch it.  It had some Visual Pop-out but not much.<br /><br />The Darkest hour wasn't so great.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Most of the third book was a roller coaster ride of pain and suffering for Katniss and honestly, it started to get real old after awhile. What pissed me off the most was that Katniss when through so much during her time in the games just to have this entire book dealt to her, it makes me worry about her future sanity.<br /><br />Overall, it gets a 4 because I care so much about the characters and their future. This is rarely achievable in books now a days that's when it comes around, you know it deserve this kind of review
0385536828|4.0|Serena Frome, a Cambridge student, seems to be the perfect candidate to infiltrate the literary circle of a promising young writer named Tom Healy.  And she might also be the perfect recruit for MI5, a British intelligence agency set on manipulating the cultural conversation by funding writers whose politics align with those of the government.  An operation dubbed Sweet Tooth.<br /><br />Beginning in 1972, [[ASIN:0385536828 Sweet Tooth: A Novel]] carries the reader along into Serena's back story:  child of a Bishop, sister to a troubled and addicted young woman, and a failure at love affairs.  Still troubling her is the romance with an older man named Tony Canning, who discarded her abruptly, thus setting her on a path toward poor choices.<br /><br />Joining the MI5 group and meeting Tom Healy seem like more chance events, but are they?  What previous events have set Serena on a journey toward secrecy, lies, and betrayals?  And at what point does the path diverge and turn into something drastically different?<br /><br />Near the end of the story, when Serena begins to wonder about how the events unfolded, she recalls the beginnings and thinks:<br /><br />\\"I experienced again the vague longing and frustration that came with the idea that I was living the wrong sort of life.  I hadn't chosen it for myself.  It was all down to chance.  If I hadn't met Jeremy, and therefore Tony, I wouldn't be in this mess, travelling at speed towards some kind of disaster I didn't dare contemplate.\\"<br /><br />And then in a final burst of narration, the author turns everything we thought we knew on its axis and shows us another perspective on it all.  We then have to question our own conclusions and even Serena and Tom.  What is true and what has been created?  An interesting shift to ponder.<br /><br />There were portions of the story that fell flat, leaving me deflated; the narrative felt forced.  And other parts revealed enough about the characters to make them interesting.  The ending surprised me, and for a moment, I imagined how everything might play out and turn around.  This part was intriguing to me.  Not my favorite by this author, however.  Four stars.ing surprised me, and for a moment, I imagined how everything might play out and turn around.

0316228532|4.0|This was the first JK Rowling book I've read, but I had heard good things about from everyone who's read the Harry Potter books.  I found getting to know the characters in about the first quarter of book a rather slow affair. However, once I knew all the players the story really picked up and the book was hard to put down.  I really enjoyed developing strong feelings about the characters and really caring who would prevail in all the conflicts going on in Pagford.  I look forward to Ms. Rowling's next venture into adult novels.

B001F3FUK6|1.0|This movie gets owned by Iron Man. The superhero genre took a major leap forward and left this weak sauce on the ground. Thor Cap A, Iron man 2, all the Spidermans and the new new Spiderman even the Hulk with Ed Norton is better than this.  The new Batmans and even Green Lantern are better !  Least we forget the Avengers which has more excitement in one scene than this entire movie. After you've seen those other 14 movies try and watch this garbage.  You likely won't finish.

B0097NGUJG|5.0|I bought An Awesome Wave after hearing the song Dissolve Me on an in internet radio station a few times. I was not disappointed: this is one of the best albums I've heard in years, a group of songs that defy categorization. Aside from Dissolve Me, the song getting the most airplay, I especially enjoy Something Good and Taro. But every track on the album has a strangely varied but harmonious aural landscape. While they're a little obscure at the moment, Alt-J are definitely a band to watch. I expect more great things from these guys in the future.
B007KLKFSO|5.0|I'm not a big fan of romances but I absolutely loved this book. It is a love story, but not a light one.<br /><br />Eleanor & Park is the story of two teens who live in Omaha and meet for the first time on the school bus, in 1986. She is the \\"new girl\\", \\"big and awkward, with crazy hair, bright red on top of curly...she had on a plaid shirt, a man's shirt, with half a dozen weird necklaces hanging around her neck and scarves wrapped around her wrists. She reminded Park of a scarecrow...\\". That is Park's first impression of Eleanor. He is a \\"weird Asian kid. He had green eyes. And skin the color of sunshine through honey\\". That's how Eleanor sees him.<br /><br />They are both outsiders, but each of them in a different way. She just moved in the neighborhood to her mom and stepdad's small house, where she has to share a small room with her other four younger siblings. She is poor. Her family is not perfect...her stepfather drinks a lot and is violent towards everyone, her mother doesn't do anything about that, even though her husband beats her and treats her like a servant and her real father has a new family and doesn't really want Eleanor to be a part of it. On top of that, everyone at school labels her as an outcast the moment she steps onto the school bus. He feels like an outsider because of his Korean origin and sometimes people make racist jokes about him. Parker has some friends but he doesn't have a lot in common with them. He and his brother take taekwondo lessons because their dad loves martial arts and wants his sons to act like \\"real men\\". He loves music and comic books and after a few days those two things manage to create a powerful bond between Eleanor and Park. But their relationship has to face quite a lot of obstacles. Will they manage to overcome all the difficulties and have a happy ending? Read and find out.:)<br /><br />The book was a page turner for me. I read it in two days (it took me so long because I didn't have much time for reading), I really wanted to know what was going to happen with the two characters.<br /><br />The story is told from Eleanor's and Park's perspectives. I loved the main characters, they were strong and the author allowed them to stand both as individuals and as a couple. The characters evolved throughout the book; in the end they managed to find themselves and to accept the way they were.<br /><br />I liked the author's writing style. The story seemed very real and all the characters were very believable. Music and comic books have a big role in this book. There are a lot of references to bands and singers from that period (The Smiths, The Beatles, Elvis Costello and many, many others). That's why I think the US cover is perfect for this book.<br /><br />I recommend Eleanor & Park to everyone and I hope you'll enjoy it as much as I did.<br />Thanks to Netgalley.com and St. Martin's Press for sending me this e-book.

0316228532|5.0|Reading the reviews here, I think that many of the readers are doing J.K. Rowling the supreme disservice of secretly hoping for an adult version of Harry Potter while reading this book.<br /><br />It is NOT Harry Potter, the author repeatedly told us it was not Harry Potter, yet that seems to be the main complaint of negative reviewers.  Indeed, those who only liked Harry Potter for the magic, the grand adventure and the good vs. evil storyline should probably not read this book.  It has none of that.<br /><br />On the other hand, those who like HP for everything listed above and Rowling's writing skill, coupled with her ability to create characters who are real, not one dimensional, probably will enjoy \\"A Casual Vacancy.\\"<br /><br />I am an avid Harry Potter fan and have read the books many times.  That being said, I read this book with no expectation that it would bear any resemblance to the HP series except in writing quality and character development.  I was not disappointed.<br /><br />This is a rough book: it contains difficult themes and has no climatic, wrap-it-all-up, feel-good ending.  Instead, it does was British writers do so much better than those on this side of the Pond: it presents a portrait of real life in a way which is compelling but not melodramatic.  It doesn't offer quick fixes or easy answers but allows us to draw our own conclusions.<br /><br />My advice for people contemplating reading this book is simple: if you're looking for Harry Potter, stay away!  If, however, you're looking for a compelling portrait of real life offered up by a high-quality writer, you will not be disappointed.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|What is the problem? It's a high-budget stab at a good movie, with a deep thought. Why not??<br /><br />Foremost, Ridley Scott. The name is practically synonomous with something that will entertain you.<br /><br />And second, who would find fault with a genuine attempt at a good movie??<br /><br />Okay, there are a few problems, but nothing that would prevent me from thoroughly enjoying this movie. It was awesome.<br /><br />For factual people out there, there are some very legitimate \\"problems\\" with our whole history of evolution. What has been taught and thought for the last 100 years has been a questionable enterprise. There are historical sites around the world that call into question some very basic ideas that most of us hold as TRUE. Current underwater archeology has shown cities that are not where they should be. That the 11 or 13,000 years of human activity may actually be a LOT longer. I know, it infuriates some people to think that some of the human history we accept, may be a little off. Or totally wrong, different, longer. Using Procession of the Earth, some very respected scientists are dating the Great Pyramid to an age of 13,000 years (this would be to accurately point the 'holes' directly at those stars, and there's no way to carbon date the Pyramid, so who's to say?).<br /><br />The point is, that our history IS ACTUALLY a mystery, the greatest mystery. And for someone to offer up a fictional story, exploring an idea is wonderful. No, I don't think that Prometheus accurately tells our historical beginnings, but why not think outside of the BOX? It's the only way we will ever get closer to the truth. The TRUTH, IS INDEED STRANGER THAN FICTION. If anything, I believe that. So go on Ridley, you keep at it, I AM ENTERTAINED. That's the whole point of a good story, NO??
0062206281|4.0|I fell in love with the Shadow of the Wind while sitting in a Barnes & Noble book store a couple years ago and have never looked back. This book continues on with the gothic yet vivid and poetic structure that is characteristic of Zafon's novels. This novel is shorter than the others which did make me pretty sad. I didn't think it would, but it did. I can't get enough of Zafon's work so that is why I give it 4 stars. I feel Zafon could have developed more of the story and created the labyrinth of characters in more detail as he did in the other novels. But besides that, this book is great. Don't let other reviews sway you with their reading too deep into the portrayal of women crap. People just look for excuses to put down someone else's work. This book is great and I savored every line. As will you if you buy this book. If you like the Angels Game and SOTW, this has the same feel but does leave you wishing for more.
B0076L9W9Q|5.0|Halestorm kick's ass again!Halestorm continues the greatness of rock with The Strange Case Of...Halestorm.I love the debut effort,but I will say this second Cd I love even more.The band continues with excellent musicianship all around.Lizzy Hale sounds better than ever with a voice of a sweet and alluring Rock N' Roll vixen that will send your music senses on the ride of your life.Some of the things that I love about Lizzy is the attitude of being yourself and not taking sh** from anyone which she shows in the punch ya in the face songs like Love Bites{So Do I},Freak Like Me,and You Call Me A Bitch Like Its A Bad Thing.Then you also get the straight up rockin songs like I Miss The Misery,Rockshow,American Boys,and Daughter Of Darkness that are just pure enjoyment and will make your rock senses more pleased than ever.The three ballad songs are Beautiful With You,In Your Room,and Break In which are three of the best slower songs I've heard in a while.Lizzy again shows her range with heartfelt passion and soulful vocals that are very real to where they touch your heart.Here's To Us is a favorite where Lizzy identifies with all the people that bust their ass day in and day out and just need a drink or two to relax while spending time with friends.This is a 10 out of 10 sophmore effort from Halestorm that is one of the best rock/metal cd's of the year.If you liked the first Halestorm cd ,you will love this effort.Bottom line if you want some excellent rock/metal music to please the sense of sound,pick up The Strange Case Of...Halestorm.Halestorm Rocks!!!
0316228532|5.0|I read Harry Potter books and enjoyed them however Casual Vacancy is by far better written, and more interesting.  It definately attracts a different audience and maybe that is why some people are disappointed in the book.  Harry Potter fans will be disappointed in the down to earth plot (no wizardry) and more indepth character development. I think it was one of the best books I read this year. I couldn't put it down.
B001SGEUNI|5.0|Halestorm kick's ass!Finally a excellent as hell Rock/Metal band for the new millenium.The entire band is musically sound all around with killer guitar riffs,awesome bass and drum tempo,along with the masterful vocals of Lizzy Hale.Lizzy can sing the slower songs with a soulful and heartfelt passion of an alluring rock vixen you can't resist while blowing your mind with the take no sh** from anyone attitude in the hard rockin up tempo songs like the most kick-ass metal/rock siren your ears will ever have the pleasure of listening too.The CD has all the rockin songs that will send your rock senses on a thrill ride like It's Not You,I Get Off,What Were You Expecting?,and Nothing To Do With Love.Then you have the musically great slower songs like Familiar Taste Of Poison,and Better Sorry Than Safe.Overall this is a 10 out of 10 rock/metal cd that finally has music headed in the right direction.All the songs are excellent on this debut effort from Halestorm and is a must have for all rock fans out there.It's a refreshing sight to see a sexy as hell,strong willed,independent women like Lizzy Hale doing the rock world proud.Bottom line if you like quality rock/metal music you will love Halestorm.Halestorm Rocks!!!

B0010ZR160|4.0|I only recently started reading Dennis Lehane's excellent Kenzie and Gennaro series of mysteries and I will recommend that you watch Ben Affleck's film adaptation first, before reading the book. The film is very well done, but after reading the novel, I think it was miscast, except for Amy Ryan as Helene, who was outstanding. Casey Affleck is a good actor but Ben's film would have been better served if he had cast himself as Patrick Kenzie. And most of the other major roles were miscast, as well (in my humble opinion). That said, I think Ben Affleck did an excellent job of directing, and am glad he's enjoying a successful second career as a director because of this film.

B005S9EJ46|4.0|THE BEST EXOTIC MARIGOLD HOTEL is proof positive that you don't need all the things Hollywood thinks you do to make a great movie. You don't need naked actors, explosions, violence or nubile young starlets. When you make a movie with heart, with feeling and emotion, you make something that can stand the test of time rather than just the number of weeks it can hold a top spot on the charts.<br /><br />The plot behind the story involves a number of elderly Brits who for one reason or another find themselves seeking a different means of living on what little they have. Evelyn (Dame Judi Dench) has just lost her husband only to find he left her with enough debt that she must sell their flat. Graham (Tom Wilkinson) is a judge who decides the time is right to retire before he becomes the old fogey giving a boring retirement speech. Douglas and Jean (Bill Nighy and Penelope Wilton) are a retiring couple who may have lost everything investing in their daughter's internet company. Norman (Ronald Pickup) is an older gent wanting to feel young just one more time. Madge (Celia Imrie) is an woman searching for one last rich husband. And Muriel (Maggie Smith) is an elderly woman in need of a hip replacement who can either wait 6 months or get immediate attention in India, the location that all of these people decide to go to.<br /><br />Having read about the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel via brochure, they become traveling companions on their way to a new adventure. Unfortunately the hotel isn't quite what it pretended to be. Sonny (Dev Patel) is the son of the now deceased owner who is trying to make the hotel what his father once dreamed of. But rather than just becoming a place for tourist, the hotel caters to the elderly looking for a place to stay either short term or until the end. But none here are close to that, at least not in spirit.<br /><br />Each character has their own story. Evelyn is the center piece, giving us background as she starts a blog to let folks back home know of her adventures. She goes so far at to take a job helping a phone sales group understand how to talk to English people. Norman is there to rekindle something that happened in his past, something that happened in this very town.<br /><br />Douglas finds himself fascinated with the area and attempts to absorb each and every item he can see and experience. His wife Jean is just the opposite, choosing to stay in the hotel and complain about each and every thing that happens. She's an unhappy woman and lets everyone know about it. Madge and Norman both gravitate to the local posh club in town where they hope to meet someone and find their fortunes at getting lucky improve. Muriel is another complainer but hers is more along the lines of prejudices against the people of India that are based more on what she's heard than what she's experienced.<br /><br />Interwoven in the guests stories is that of Sonny who has chosen to make his father's dream come true. In love with a local girl that his mother decides is unsuitable for him to marry; he must either decide to follow his heart or his family.<br /><br />The movie moves along at an even pace, never rushing through one story or another and blending each of them together smoothly rather than place each in a time limit only to go to the next. Even though they all have their tale to tell, the fact that they've chosen to become best friends (in some cases eventually) shows who these people are. And while their trip to this country at first seemed due to a case of need, they soon find themselves enchanted by the area they've chosen as their new home.<br /><br />The sights and sounds of India are on display here from moment to moment. Not just the grand and glorious colors and images that seem beautiful but the poorer sections as well. This feels more like the real India and not just a travelogue showing us the best. And the characters experience it just as much as the viewer.<br /><br />The idea of getting older, of not knowing what your future holds or how long you have to enjoy that future is what makes this film work. We're presented with different ways of looking at life here, good and bad, and how the characters choose what path to take. The acting is superb but why wouldn't it be with the talent pool collected here. Not one actor slips or slides in this film where each shines instead.<br /><br />It's time for a feel good movie. And this one suits that need. It won't have you sitting on the edge of your seat, but it will hold your attention from start to finish. And perhaps when it ends, you'll hope that your life comes to the same wonderful world that these folks enjoy.wing what your future holds or how long you have to enjoy that future is what makes this film work.

B0059XTV4Y|1.0|Madonna has yet to direct a movie that entertains or enlightens or even just makes you want to see more from her. Granted she's only directed two but without the celebrity status she brings to a picture why would anyone hire her to direct when so many good directors are looking for their next project?<br /><br />W.E. is the story of Wallis Simpson, the American divorcee, and Edward, the next King of England, and their romance. Well for most the story would be about that. Instead Madonna puts a new twist on the story that's been told time and time again. And of course that twist is more lurid than most films choose to use.<br /><br />But rather than just stick with the one story we have another running first and alongside the famous romance. A young woman is trouble with her marriage to her husband and keeps coming back to an auction house selling off pieces of Simpson's past. What a great way to go back and forth in time and allow for some glimpses of newer lingerie.<br /><br />Its been said that the point of this film was less about presenting an historically accurate telling of the same tale once more but more about discussing celebrity and people's desire to have that notoriety. In the way this story is told that seems to be the only thing that interests Wallis Simpson. In an unhappy marriage (on her part at least) she seeks fame and attention. She wants the hoi paloi to take notice of her, to talk about her parties and her friendships. Edward comes off as little more than a party boy who goes from one woman to the next. I could be wrong but I think there was more to their story than that and using them to tell a story completely foreign to their real lives seems a bit much.  Rather than do so why not just use a fictional couple instead? Using historical figures involves viewers bringing with them the baggage of knowing what they know about them already. To try and present them as something else just causes confusion.<br /><br />But that's not the worst of it. The worst of it is that the film is completely boring. There are no characters to sympathize with, to care about or to feel involved with. Everyone is self serving and watching them prance about from one party to another is just tedious.<br /><br />One thing will result from this movie. Those who are die hard fans of Madonna will rise to the occasion and defend it as a work of art. They will attack anyone who dares try to say different. Fortunately this is a minority from the look of the box office results for this film as well as DVD sales. With any luck that will mean that Madonna will decide she's better off performing live, recording music or simply acting. Leave directing to those who know how to do it best.e worst of it is that the film is completely boring. There are no characters to sympathize with, to care about or to feel involved with.

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Nearly everyone at one time or another has read a comic book. More often than not we associate those drawn color images with our childhood and leave it at that. The fact is that comics are no longer a source of entertainment for children for the most part, instead covering topics like drug addiction, alcoholism, homosexuality and more. Yes, there are comics made for children but not the majority. But at the core of these comics, beneath the surface issues of the day, is the basic fact that the core of them all involves heroes. And through the trials and tribulations various writers put their characters through that is always what we come back to.<br /><br />Marvel Comics nearly went under until the early sixties when they began telling stories that involved more the more realistic aspects of life. Because of that a new form of hero was born, one that had problems and lived in the real world when not wearing a cape. Fans loved these stories so when it came time to turn them into movies of course Hollywood messed it up, turning its back on what fans loved; until recently when fans flocked to see Robert Downey starring as Iron Man.<br /><br />But that was only the beginning of a long term plan at Marvel. Those that learned remained in their seats as the credits finished to catch a teaser for something coming down the line. It happened again and again after each Marvel character movie from the Hulk to Captain America. It was all leading to the first team up movie involving comic book characters. It was leading to THE AVENGERS.<br /><br />If you haven't seen this film by all means run out and buy a copy today. This is not just a rental movie, this is a film that can be enjoyed over and over again, allowing you to catch new things each time you watch as well as enjoy the things you loved the first time around. For me it is the best comic book movie ever made and the only bad part is having to wait until the next Avengers outing.<br /><br />The story revolves around the Tessaract, an energy source discovered at the end of the Captain America film. The top secret government agency S.H.I.E.L.D. (Strategic Hazard Intervention Espionage Logistics Directorate) has been trying to figure out how to harness the power of this object. That all changes when it suddenly opens a portal to another world allowing Loki (Tom Hiddleston), the Asgardian God of mischief and sworn enemy of his half brother Thor (Chris Hemsworth), to enter. Loki uses a staff to control the minds of scientist Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard) and top agent Clint \\"Hawkeye\\" Barton (Jeremy Renner). They escape with the Tessaract and force the hand of S.H.I.E.L.D. head Nick Fury (Samuel Jackson) to engage the Avengers Project.<br /><br />The project is an assemblage of various super heroes, people with abilities above the norm, to unite as a team to take on any problem considered too large for normal channels to handle. The first group that Fury assembles includes agent Natasha \\"Black Widow\\" Romanov (Scarlett Johannson) who recruits scientist Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) who turns into the Hulk. Captain America (Chris Evans) has been kept with Fury in preparation for this moment. Lastly they ask Tony Stark (Robert Downey) aka Iron Man.<br /><br />Facing off against Loki he is captured but on the way back the team's airship is attacked by none other than Thor. A knock down drag out fight follows between Thor and Iron Man until Captain America breaks it up. With Thor on the team now, they take Loki back to the hellicarrier (an item that needs seen to be believed) for safe keeping. Unfortunately this doesn't end up being a good idea.<br /><br />Selvig in the meantime has found a way to harness the Tessaract and open the portal to a far off galaxy that allows their army to enter our world. This was Loki's plan all along. Trust me this is no spoiler as scenes of the final battle were in nearly every trailer for the film before it opened. With Hawkeye rescued and now a part of the team willthese seven heroes be enough to prevent an all out invasion of the planet? And will each member of the team be able to face their own personal demons and become the hero that he/she is destined to be?<br /><br />This movie rocks like no other. The witty retorts, the campy lines when needed, the suspense of what will happen next fluctuate from scene to scene and keep you waiting to see what will happen next. Director Joss Whedon of BUFFY fame has put together a movie that brings a depth to the characters and story that mingle together to form a story movie that is filled with amazing special effects but effects that don't overshadow what is taking place.<br /><br />The acting by all involved is amazing and each actor takes their turn at making their character believable. You watch and never question if Evans is really Captain America or if Hawkeye can really shoot arrows this way. You just believe. If any one stands out in particular it's Downey. He just commands attention every time he comes into view. His quips are some of the best and suit his character. Having been the first of this group to star as his character it's only natural.<br /><br />The entertainment value of this movie is astronomical. From start to finish you'll sit at the edge of your seat waiting to see what happens next. Even side characters are given special moments here. There is never a dull moment in this film.<br /><br />One last note: as with all Marvel movies, even this movie has a secret ending to it. As a matter of fact it has two. The first comes early during the credits, the second after all the credits have finished. Stick around and watch both. Rumor has it that one of them will bleed over into the next Thor film. Iron Man 3 is nearly done filming. And the Avengers will return soon. One can only wait with anticipation until it arrives. .these seven heroes be enough to prevent an all out invasion of the planet?

B009GEEMLY|5.0|This is a must see for any super hero comic book lover!  There is a perfect mix of humor and danger.  Everyone of the heroes play their part with extreme finesse and beautiful timing.  I have watched the movie perhaps 15 times already with my grand children and still enjoy every bit of it!  I would tell you some of my favorite parts, but that would be considered \\"spoilers\\".  Can't do that!!  It was GENIUS to use all the same actors... well, except the HULK, who was played flawlessly by Mark Ruffalo!  The dialog could not have been better.  This is a work of art and will remain in my library for as long as Amazon provides service!
B0058YPILY|4.0|I find it difficult to believe that there are so many quality television shows on the air these days. For so long it felt like there was nothing to watch. Now I find myself torn between shows appearing on opposing channels at the same time or find the DVR overloaded with shows I've missed. This is one of the reasons that shows being released on DVD at somewhat affordable prices are doing so well right now. And one show that continues to remain a quality series is CRIMINAL MINDS.<br /><br />For those who have never seen the series (or who missed when I've spoken of previous seasons) the show revolves around a group of FBI profilers who are sent around the country to help law enforcement agencies apprehend serial criminals. Some cases involve rape, others arson but for the most part they seek out serial killers. The statistic that at any one time there are up to 80 serial killers walking around at one time is scary. The thought that there is actually a group like this seeking them out should help you sleep at night.<br /><br />There isn't one single character that stands out among this ensemble piece but while the focus may change from one to another with each episode Thomas Gibson as Agent Aaron Hotchner is the focal point. The leader of the team has gone through some serious problems in the past (one serial killer murdered his wife for revenge) and this year we witness him adapting to being a single parent. But while Hotchner's life is seen so are the lives of the other cast members. And the series opens with the effects of what happened at the end of season 6 when the group thought agent Emily Prentiss (Paget Brewster) was killed.<br /><br />Agent Derek Morgan (Shemar Moore) has been using his own time to seek out the killer responsible for Prentiss' death unofficially. When the group is called before a hearing concerning their activities only one person can clear them: Agent Prentiss. As we saw (though the group didn't know) she was still alive. Now as the season progresses we watch as each member of the team must deal with the return of someone they held dear who was unable to let them know she was fine. While they still work together and are closer than most working groups, a certain amount of distrust is the residue left over from this secret and something that must be roughed out as the season progresses.<br /><br />In the meantime there are plenty of criminals still out there that the BAU (Behavioral Analysis Unit) must help catch. Kidnapping with ties to the 80s, a copycat killer imitating a case Hotchner and Rossi (Joe Mantegna) worked on years ago, a 9 year olds abduction, murder at a military boy's school and more form the cases the group works on. Each one calls for various members of the group to put their personal skills to the test and find the guilty party before more damage can be done.<br /><br />While the search for criminals continues the personal lives of the group come into play as well. Not only do they have to deal with the return of Prentiss, they are also still dealing with the return of JJ (A.J. Cook) who left the team in season 6. Dr. Spencer Reid (Matthew Gray Gubler) continues to deal with the mental problems he fears he inherited from his mother. Morgan finds himself involved in a case where the missing cousin discussed in another season may have re-appeared. And Garcia (Kirsten Vangsness) finds herself in a romantic situation.<br /><br />Watching this series from the beginning you begin to identify with the characters involved. They begin to feel like family. You find yourself caring for each and every one of them. It doesn't seem like these are merely characters on the screen but friends you've grown comfortable with while watching. That's the secret of a great ensemble cast and CRIMINAL MINDS has developed one of the best ensemble casts ever assembled. The talent of each actor pours from the screen and not one is left to the side and not given some personal chance to prove their mettle here.<br /><br />If you're a fan of the series you'll want to make sure you add this season to your collection. If you're not a fan, then by all means start collecting from the beginning and work your way to this one. I've picked them all up and have found that they are never boring to go back and watch again. This series is one that gets better was it moves forward and should satisfy the most jaded mystery fan.r /><br />If you're a fan of the series you'll want to make sure you add this season to your collection.

0307960471|4.0|This is the latest in Nesbo's novels about the failures of Harry Hole as a person and his tenacious brilliance as a police investigator. The tale is clever and well-paced. Nesbo packs a vast amount of plot into his story; it's almost operatic with walk-on crooks and losers and a myriad of detailed clues and episodes. Basically, it's a mystery about a murder, with Harry's ex-lover's son the open-and-shut case suspect, and an interlinked drug conspiracy. It is very complex and hard to summarize. The best comparisons I can make is that as a procedural it has the grounded doggedness of The Wired, and makes Blade Runner look like a rural idyll. It is also very much in the Hannibal Lechter style of characterization.<br /><br />The novel is independent of its predecessor, The Snowman, but very linked to it. That is the backdrop for where and who Harry is. Phantom is nowhere near as desperately brutal and bleak as Snowman, which was in many ways about the disintegration of a person and the edging down to the bottom of everything -- the bottles of booze, criminal down and outs, nihilism and the joy of blood and pain. Nesbo is one of the writers demythologizing the Scandinavia world image of a placid society of low crime and good living. The plot of Phantom is all about the gang world and lost junkies, with hidden puppet masters of brutal, vicious and disdainful malice. It's a wasteland of immigrants and crooked cops, with, again, hidden figures pulling the strings. One of its repeated themes is that Oslo has one of the highest drug addiction rates in the world.<br /><br />Harry returns to Oslo from Hong Kong, where he went after he left the police in disgrace. A chronic drunk, he spends his time there on drugs and gambling. He returns to Norway fighting to stay sober, in order to investigate the murder of a junkie-dealer, ostensibly by the son of long-suffering Rakel, whose own life and sanity were so savaged by the killer-sadist in Snowman. Oleg, her son who worshiped Harry,is a junkie and the accused killer of his closest accomplice (who provides a from-the-dead commentary throughout the novel). The context of the murder is a new meta-drug, violin, that the unknown and very violent Dubai -- an immigrant as so many of Nesbo's villains are -- uses to take control of Oslo's streets.<br /><br />The story hangs together pretty well. It's a little long and as the paragraph above suggests it's often not a pleasant read. (There are crooked cops a-plenty, perverts, over-sexed politicians and sundry other riffraff.) It is all powerful and compelling and Harry is interesting in his skill and perceptive in his introspection. Nesbo is a vivid narrator and is able to maintain a pace and clarity that keeps the book moving forward all the time.<br /><br />My reservation is the Lechter element. The world of Nesbo is vile. He too  often relishes in the details of the gutter -- a rat is on stage on many occasions and torture is part of the currency of drug commerce. I sometimes find myself avoiding letting go and really giving in to the flow -- there's too often a grim brutality coming on the next page or a betrayal or a flow of junkie images.In some instances, the violence explains a character who is otherwise not really fleshed out and brought to life.<br /><br />I rate Phantom quite high because Nesbo is very skilled in what he does.

0307454568|4.0|This reminds me of those thrillers that you sit through at the cinema which have such a brilliant third act that you will put up with an hour of tedium first. This vast, sprawling 750 page monster is less easy to forgive and could have done with a good edit.<br /><br />For the first time ever in a Larsson book, I became disengaged at the point that it became a conspiracy thriller because to explain his theories on the Olaf Palme assassination and the corruption at the heart of the Swedish security services, Larsson felt the need to introduce a seemingly endless array of characters: cops, spies, government officials and gangsters.<br /><br />I don't know about you but there comes a point in a book like this where you want to put your hand up and say, enough with the characters! I don't know what half of them are doing here, whether they're good or whether they're bad, and what was their name again? And now you want to introduce more?<br /><br />All I wanted to find out about was what was going to happen to a somewhat diminished human being called Lisbeth Salander.  When Lisbeth finally does come back into the story that's when the story really takes off... When Salander does reappear, she is like the Salander of the first in the series - a real, complex and dysfunctional character, unlike the cyborg of the second book.<br /><br />When Mikael Blomkvist, the author's alter-ego, has a fling with a super fit female cop, who encourages him to get out and get fit it, that's when it feels a little sad, almost a foreshadowing of the author's own death; as though he  knew what an unhealthy lifestyle he was leading and that he really needed to do something about it.<br /><br />Others have noted the rather heavy-handed one page asides about female warriors.  I could have forgiven him for those, but it is the unnecessary sub-plots that I felt detracted rather than enhanced the main story.  For instance, Berger's stalker and Salander's financial advisor, both of whom are pretty dull, and who therefore,  and don't deserve an inner life or a back story.<br /><br />But these relatively minor points aside, Larsson was still one of the most original thriller voices in his all too brief life and it felt sad to say goodbye to Salander in this final instalment.ull, and who therefore,  and don't deserve an inner life or a back story.<br /><br />But these relatively minor points aside, Larsson was still one of the most original thriller voices in his all too brief life and it felt sad to say goodbye to Salander in this final instalment.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|I truly enjoyed this book. It made me want to keep reading to the last page and then I wanted more. It kept you wondering what could possibly happen next. Then something new would occur. Even though it was very graphic it was well worth the read. I have not heard anyone that has actually read these books not enjoy the read. You could feel the extreme love and passion between the couple. It is wonderful having a Kindle to just order the next book in the series in the middle of the night and continue reading.

1449410243|5.0|Very funny book.  I was impressed with the physical quality of this book.  High quality high-res pictures on thick robust pages.  Too bad it was over with too soon, I can't get enough of the Oatmeal.  I purchased this book mainly to support the man who has given me so many laughs on the internet, and more were delivered on these pages.  I strongly recommend the physical copy, as it's the perfect book for a coffee table or a bathroom.  It's also the kind of book you want to share with your cat-owning friends (or anybody who would enjoy this type of humor) - and you don't usually want to lend out your kindle...  Aside from cat-humor, a good chunk of the book is dedicated to the Bobcats, which is a mix of office and cat humor.  A+ book, would buy again.
