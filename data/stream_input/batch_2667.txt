B007J4T2G8|5.0|I think the story is similar to Twilight...a young girl falling for the bad boy. Don't read the first book unless you plan on reading all 3!
B004K8WPUQ|5.0|Does exactly what was advertised. Gave me great audio in noisy gymnasium. You definitely won't regret this purchase. I sure don't.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|Not bad - it was a little slow reading, but I had seen the movie and I wanted to read the book. It was different than the movie so that kept my interest.
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|Highly anticipated movie that really followed through and ended really well.  The story line was incredible, it kept you totally engaged throughout the entire movie.  I was fascinated on how the characters were portrayed in different time periods and how they crossed each others paths.  Also, I loved how the movie just jumps right in to the story and action.  I definitely recommend this to anyone who has an open mind and a sense of adventure.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Good end to a great series, thoroughly enjoyed it. Got a little nerve-wracking in the end though.  Hooray Brandon sandesetson
B00CVV1FJ6|5.0|The Primals remain one of the best UK rock bands around...consistent, inventive, political, angry, sexy...their work is never boring, never bland. It's challenging and complex, working with a recipe of early House, Funkadelic, CAN, The Stooges, The Beatles and The Pretty Things (the psychedelia), and The Stones. More Light feels like a Dystopian science fiction novel by JG Ballard set to a sleazy future film score. Bobby hisses and croons and shouts on these tracks, in places evoking Peggy Lee and Nick Cave, in others Joe Strummer and Iggy Pop. The opening track 2013 has some powerfully scorching lyrics, challenging fake protest and creeping apathy, punctuated with a brassy horn riff stolen from a Herp Albert album. It sets the tone for this record, which seems to hold a cracked mirror to society, reporting back apocalyptic visions and broadcasting warnings. There isn't a bad track on this LP. I think my favorite is Relativity (&#34;You're broken like your family/I guess you must be lonely...&#34;). A powerful, aggressive, poetic album.

B00BU18U82|3.0|This game is a little complex for my 5yr old. I even tried it and ended up putting it down 5 mins later. I'm very sure given a little more time and patience this could be a very fun and addicting game. Just not for me.

B0099114WO|3.0|In the extra materials for the DVD, Meryl Streep remarks that the characters seem to be out of place in contemporary life, and I agree. Had this movie been set twenty or thirty years earlier I might have been better able to buy the storyline -- 60ish couple married over 30 years haven't shared a bedroom or had sex in five years. Wife Kay (Streep) has a parttime job in a friend's yarn and gift shop, husband Arnold (Jones) is a CPA (apparently the only one in the firm not making a good salary, as all he does is complain about the cost of everything). Wife tries unsuccessfully to seduce husband, who apparently has forgotten what certain body part are for, and decides to revive their marriage at a Hope Springs, Maine couples facility, run by Steve Carell. Arnold is  resistent to everything -- doesn't like the charming town, although he has plenty of money can hardly deal with a $12 breakfast special, and at first stonewalls every suggestion that involves sex, which means he stonewalls every suggestion as they all involve sex. Kay is more open but has some areas that bring her discomfort to discuss. The ending is very predictable.<br /><br />While I think that both Streep and Jones make a believable couple of the old school -- I think we have to assume that at least Arnold is among the oldest of the Baby Boomers, born between 1946 - 1949, with Kay a few years younger -- I never for an instant believed Steve Carell in his role. He played it lowkey, but he seemed to just be puckish Carell to me: my reaction was, \\"oh, look, Steve Carell again.\\" With Streep and Jones I was able to eventually accept that they were not like  most couples that I know, due to the quality of the performances. But with all the constant emphasis on sex among the elderly (sorry, but mid-60's is not middle age) even without the aid of some erectile dysfunction drug, much of it became cringe-worthy. It was like listening to a relative or close friend talk about oral sex -- TMI! Streep looked her real age thoughout the movie, not much make up, slightly plump, but still attractive. Jones has had a craggy lived-in look for many years and has perfected the curmudgeon almost to it being a cliche. Both have had better vehicles.age thoughout the movie, not much make up, slightly plump, but still attractive.

B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I used to look at people like Auggie and feel sorry for them. I used to think that they were weird. Now I notice people like Auggie and want to get to know them better. This book has taught me that those people aren't so different from us. I think this book is well written and has a good message, you can never judge a book by its cover.

1476733953|5.0|I've bought and read all 5 books separately, but I'm reviewing the entire series in one review. Bear with me.<br /><br />I'm cheap...and a very fast reader, so I have a hard time paying for books when I can finish them in a couple of hours, but after PLEADING with my local library to purchase the first book in this series (and never getting anywhere) I finally broke down and got the first book for myself. Of course, I'd dragged my feet so long, that Wool 1 was FREE!!! Whoo-hooooo!!!! Of course, I can see that it was Howey's nefarious plan to get me addicted to this story so I'd HAVE to pay for the rest.<br /><br />I wasn't disappointed.<br /><br />He weaves an intriguing story about people living (presumably) underground in a Silo, and periodically, people are sent out for \\"cleaning\\" and their death. Why would anyone choose it? Where is this taking place? Why are there so many secrets and taboos? Howey answers (most) of these questions in inch by excruciating inch, yet ends the series with so many more questions...so of course I'll keep reading anything about the Silos that he publishes.<br /><br />Smart man.<br /><br />Anyway, read this. You won't regret i

0425263924|5.0|No criticism or confusion here.  This book is not great literature, and the author never pretended it was suppose to be some great work of art.  This book continues the story of Eva and Gideon, their love, dealing with their past, adjusting their future as needed.  It is a great romance novel with really hot, great, sex scenes.  I enjoyed it so much and cannot wait for the next installment.  This story is a great escape.  Thank you Syliva for the mini-vacation, now hurry up and write the next one! J

Stephen King is the best writer of all time, this I know because I saw the movie Carrie and some other movies and they were totally awesome.

0060245867|5.0|My grandson requested this book since I had bought him several others in this series. After searching, this was the best price. We really don't like to pay too much for his books; at 5 his interests change so often! This series is soooo adorable. And, just like in life, in these stories, one thing leads to another & another & another! (In fun & silly ways that children identify with!) Beware, you might get hooked and that could lead to more books in this series.....I strongly suggest you purchase more than one to start!

1250012570|5.0|I see a lot of the reviews from older readers talking about how this book reminded them of their high school years, how it made them remember what it was like to be in love at 16, their first love or their second or fourth or whatever. However much I would like that to be the case for me, this book resonated with me at a much deeper level, because, even though it is set 10 years before I was born, I am sixteen and in love, and  I am pretty sure that this is the  best moment I could have ever read this book.

B0099Y2MYK|5.0|For soap opera buffs and history buffs alike.  The warning is to NOT buy from the lowest priced on Amazon.  It took three purchases before I got one without scratches and with all DVD's readable by the player.  Others finally refunded, but their product had the third disc doing the same thing-a poor version of a burned copy that was either bad to start or got that way in the process.

B0029QRA1U|1.0|I received this turntable for Christmas this past year and it worked great....until about March. Then I would try to move the arm (doesn't have the auto start), and it would go move for a second until it automatically moved itself back to the cradle. This would go on for about twenty times until I was so frustrated I just quit. I tried calling about the problem but they say they \\"never receive calls about this\\" which is a complete lie because I have personally read reviews explaining their exchange with the company. Don't waste your time on unnecessary stress-STAY AWAY FROM ION.

B005LAIIN0|1.0|i saw the trailer for this a few months back and was totally excited about it. i finished the book a few days ago and was even more excited about the film adaptation. i saw the movie in the theater yesterday and...wow. what a let down. almost entirely different than the book and not in any semblance of a good way. there were so many scenes and details in the book that would have made for incredible big screen excitement, something this film completely lacked. bummer.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I love how &#34;real&#34; this book is. It gives you the perspective from eyes in which you would not otherwise see. I laughed and cried right along with the characters. Story well told.
B00D6BN9NK|1.0|nothing much to say about this other than it was a huge, huge disappointment. i saw the first movie in theaters when it came out. a buddy and i snuck in after seeing something else at the theater. it was because of that original film, and the sequels, that i though this one had to be good. wow. i couldn't have been more wrong. \\"a good day to die hard\\" was so bad i didn't even finish watching it. the one-liners were forced and the action was pointless. that doesn't even make sense to me as i write this but it's true.<br />don't waste your money on this. the filmmakers already wasted enough of theirs.
B00CO8D3G4|3.0|I'm pretty appalled by some the the things James Altucher writes - it's like he dictated this book with no consideration for the printed word and I get the feeling I really wouldn't want to meet him in real life.<br /><br />Most of this book is a rehash of other books. A whole chapter on oxytocin (call &#34;the God Hormone&#34;) is way over the top - and it's not that big a deal anyway.<br /><br />He made the point early on that to sell his ebook on Kindle/Amazon and make a good living that way he has a web/blog site of people who like him and follow him. When a new book comes out he gives away 20 copies and asks people to review it on Amazon. With that many good reviews he then goes on to make a good living from follow on purchases.<br /><br />Hmm. Is that ethical?<br /><br />He mentions meeting a fund manager who manages a family's private funds valued at over one trillion dollars (p21). Yes trillion. That's over 6% of the whole US GDP. I don't believe it. It makes the rest of the book a little hard to swallow.<br /><br />The whole book is full of these morally/ethically/factually questionable titbits and ideas. There's a few nuggets but they are buried, so a skim read wont suffice.<br /><br />My suggestion if you buy this is to expect to have a short list of 3 or 4 dot points worth remembering (or not, depending on your situation).<br /><br />The thing that made this a 3 star review instead of 1 or 2 is that it is very up to date. It refers to events up to early 2013. Many books of this type are years or decades old and the lessons often do not apply.<br /><br />Also, he says the world of employment after the GFC has fundamentally changed and he says why and that actually makes sense. Some economists and business people are starting to say the same things.<br /><br />So given this odd mix of glib facts, throwaway ideas, warmed over rehashes and the rare real insight this book will probably polarise readers. It's certainly put this reviewer in two minds.

B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Okay. I'm a little confused and unsure. I was really feeling Gideon and Eva's story. Was sickle  in, living it with them, laughing and crying, cheering them on through Bared To You, Reflected In You and finally Entwined To You. What I don  understand is the author's note at the end.. This is not the end  of their story? WHY not?! We closed so many issues and continued to deal with what was left. His nightmares were gonna take time to get through. They are married, they are committed to making things work. What more are you going to put them through. While it would be interesting  to know who moved Nathan's bracelet, is that really what the fourth book will solve? It almost seem  like you ran out  of time to wrap up all the plot twists you developed  in creating obstacles for their relationship. As if the sexual trauma experience d by both wasn't enough! I feel a little cheated. I still love the relationship, love the story, but the ending on this book just kind of left me  little flat. I have  to know  how they end  up, so I will probably read the fourth book...but it better be damn  good, wrap up these open issue (where is Megumi? Who moved the bracelet? Showdown with Gideon's mom, etc). One can hope! In the end, I am a HUGE fan of Gideon and Eva!!! Absolutely loved them and this wonderful, crazy, sexy ride!

Then you might be so computer illiterate that you could enjoy this game.<br /><br />The object of this game is to touch two different pictures in the vague hope that you might get a new picture.  When you do, you can then use that picture to combine with your old ones to make still others.  Oh the joy!  Rapture!<br /><br />Personally, I quickly discovered that the most efficient use of my time was to match each picture item by item until something new popped up.  There was no rhyme or reason to it.  Just keep clicking until something happens.  By that point, I was about 30 minutes into the game and made the decision to delete it never to look back.  And now I have written this review so that you need not suffer.  Aren't I nice?
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It isn't as easy as it looks.  You need to find items in a certain order.  Even my 8 year old likes it too!

B0074YVW1G|5.0|For me this was a revelation, and a key to solving so many puzzles I've been trying to put together to understand certain things in my life. It helped me understand my relationship with my friends, some communication issues in my family. I'm really thankful to the author and everyone who participated in getting this book on my kindle app, so I could read it!<br /><br />Maybe this information wasn't new to some people, as some of the reviews suggest. It does mention some of the well-known facts, I guess we all know the basics about introverts vs extraverts. But this books gives a lot if perspectives on the issue, I don't think anyone had ever collected so many interesting opinions, theories, studies and facts about this AND presented it in an easy-to-read manner.<br /><br />This book doesn't only help understand introversion, it also helps in issues dealing with extraversion. For example friends of mine have a certainly extraverted kid, and some issues arising from his non-sensitive behavior, and after I told them about the comparison of high-sensitive and low-sensitive kids in the book, they were able to find some useful ideas on how to approach the problem. This book doesn't have and direct answers, but it does have enough information to supply with lots of hints on how to deal with many issues that deal with your temperament.  Once again, I'm happy I got this book.

B00571F26Y|4.0|An interesting and easy read into the history of wheat and its potential problems.<br /><br />Working in the health field I have had some experience of wheat and its effects but I never knew about the hybridization of wheat in the 1950s onward until I was referred to this book by patents. In my own case I developed a compromised digestive tract in the late 1970s after travelling the world on the cheap. I was diagnosed with gluten intolerance in 1980. It was fascinating to relate the effects as described in the book to my own experience. I had bloating, diarrhoea, eczema, acne, mood swings and fatigue. I decided to give up wheat but to my horror found I could not do so. I realised to my embarrassment that I was well and truly addicted. I was bemused by the authors suggestion that cold turkey was the best way to give up. In the end I used self psychology and sublimated my craving for wheat to fried chicken which I ate whenever I felt the urge. Some wheat in the batter but better than hitting the bread. Gradually I reduced the amount of fried chicken and two years later !! I was gluten free.<br /><br />The understanding in those days was that if you stayed off glutton for at least 5 years the intolerance would be gone. The eczema, acne, mood swings and fatigue had gone but some mild bloating remained. In my fifties I put on about 6 kilos a considerable weight for me as I had always been slim. The weight I gained went straight to my belly, my own little middle aged spread. About three years ago I became convinced that yeast was a major problem and noticed I reacted to foods with yeast so I gave up all bread yes I had reverted back to about two slices of toasted wholemeal as a sandwich for lunch, and within 6 months I had lost 4 kilos and my belly.<br /><br /> About the time I was first introduced to this book I had a patient who was quite overweight but especially had a large belly. The patient looked at me and said I expect you think I drink a lot of beer and that's why I have a big belly but I don't, I have never drunk any alcohol. Later in the waiting room his wife said to me did my husband tell you about the problem he has with eating too much bread. I said no but I knew I was onto something. And started reading the book! Wheatbelly filled in all the blank spaces. It wasn't just the gluten it was the way wheat had been hybridised to the point of indigestability with a glycaemic index to match.<br /><br />I feel my general diet is better than what Wheatbelly recommended  and skimmed thru the meal plans section which is why I only gave it four stars but it may be useful for those starting out.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to understand what has become a modern plague.y I have a big belly but I don't, I have never drunk any alcohol. Later in the waiting room his wife said to me did my husband tell you about the problem he has with eating too much bread. I said no but I knew I was onto something. And started reading the book!

It wasn't just the gluten it was the way wheat had been hybridised to the point of indigestability with a glycaemic index to match.<br /><br />I feel my general diet is better than what Wheatbelly recommended  and skimmed thru the meal plans section which is why I only gave it four stars but it may be useful for those starting out.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to understand what has become a modern plague.

B008X9Z37A|5.0|If you are looking for a heavy duty leather case that holds the Kindle in super tight, this product is NOT for you.  If you are familiar with using and transporting Kindles and only need the case to hold your Kindle, I HIGHLY recommend this item.  It holds the Kindle in just fine, as well as protecting and cushioning it.  I've used the more expensive leather cases, and liked them.  But as an experienced Kindle user, for the money I prefer the Belkin Classic Case over those designer cases.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|awesome app its. really fun and you get to compete your horse in competitions.  get this ap.  you will love it
B00AB55BS0|4.0|We were desiring to see this series but was never able to. Can't wait to see the following series, however, too much explicit sexual content.
B005544TRQ|5.0|This is a great show - fast moving never a dull moment. I can't wait for the new season to begin!

B007VUCAVO|5.0|This APP shows what can be accomplished by thinking out of the box. It's got all<br />the features needed to monitor and maintain a healthy battery. I use it every<br />day and highly recommend it to all tablet users.
B00BOXZAJ8|1.0|Kirsten Dunst is pretty cute and always fun to watch,--all of which convinced me to give this film a try.  Unfortunately, it turns out to be an incomprehensible blend of science fiction, romance and social commentary that ultimately falls flat.  One problem is a yawn inducing \\"anti-gravity\\" shtick that defies logic and induces overwhelming boredom.  No question that this is a film is to be avoided.
B004CLYKLI|4.0|I even liked her. I know, she's a bit extreme but I also think she's poking fun at herself throughout the book. She admits that her tactics have not worked in every case and she realizes in the end that she had to change in order to preserve her relationship with her daughter. And hey, her kids are kind of amazing.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|This show gets even more amazing in season 2 in my opinion. though the cliffhanger at the end is cruel and the fact that they still haven't made the next season is disappointing. This show is phenomenal though and I recommend it as a great version of the Sherlock Holmes story!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's cute, fun, and entertaining for all ages. I definitely recommend this game for anyone. Why not, it's free too!
B004132HZS|5.0|If you love the BBC you will love this show!!! it's amazing. I am a big fan of Martin Freeman and Benedict Cumberbatch and they make an amazing Sherlock & Watson!!! I wish there was more special feature on the dvd because it's coming to the point that special features is really though only reason to buy hard copies of the dvds but still I will be glad to have this in my collection as I can watch them over and over again and never get bored of them!!
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|The book was a quick read and fine until the end. That wasn't an ending, it was just stopped. The other books were better!

030759565X|5.0|I have already used this more than any other cookbook I own and I've only had it for 3 weeks.  I knew I would like the cookbook because everything I've made of Debra's blog of the same name has turned out perfectly and deliciously.  The same is true of the book.  The faro and roasted vegetable salad is a new favorite- in high rotation at our house
B00AB7HESI|5.0|This game allows you to use your imagination it's super fun and I play it when I'm bored I really recommend it to other people!!!!!! The price is good and not expensive at all.PLEASE BUY!!!!!!!!!!
0812993845|5.0|Item arrived safely.  Although I haven't read the book yet, I already know I'm going to love it as I've read every one of her books and they are all great.  Amazon had the best price for this book, they usually do.

B00DHSK3RM|1.0|candy crush level help guide was of no use to me maybe i did not understand it really do not know.
B005LAIHYU|3.0|It's over-the-top, full of bloody battles, violence, some perhaps unintentional silliness, and not at all as bad as I'd feared it would be. It's certainly a testament to the author of the screenplay who adapted his own novel. Generally speaking, writers who know novels don't know screenplays...certainly not when it's their own work. Benjamin Walker, the handsome, full-faced actor who plays Lincoln, doesn't look a bit like him until toward the end, with the beard and a mole and the shaggy haircut. But he is good.  And he has a black sidekick who actually makes it to the end of the movie without being killed! Actually, Abe makes it to the end, too, since the movie stops just as he and Mary are in their carriage, headed for the theater...and we all know what happens there. Unfortunately, like most action movies made today, there is far too much CGI. I would have preferred a bit more realism...if indeed a movie about vampires can be realistic.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|Bruno keeps getting better and better..brand new cd with so many great songs including Locked out of heaven and When i was your man.. a must have cd..
B0013TPV0Q|5.0|I can't believe that I missed this David Sedaris book.  I have read every other one and there is always one story that makes the entire book with the price of admission...and the rest are just a fantastic bonus.<br />The boarding house.  Not only did I laugh out loud, I actually found it so funny i had to READ it outloud to someone else.<br />Thank you David--through pain, through fashion, and passion, and press on buttocks. laughter always IS the best remedy.<br />Amazing, as usual.
B00C8985DU|5.0|The cd 's remastered.the dvd,the photo book.,,itinerary,poster,badge,ticket stubs,guest pass,special pass,unreleased tracks..books with interviews,Linda's photos from the tour....unbelievable packaging..and so many classic songs!!
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Typical Grisham, page turner and quick attachment to main character. But ending was rushed and forgettable. Fans will fine enjoyment. First timers (if they exist) should start elsewhere in Grisham library.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|Challenging but do able.  It would task my brain now and then but I got it.  At my age you need all the  brain challenges you can get.  Recommend this game for ages 6 and over
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is so much better then the first, especially better thhen the others like granny run and subway suffer. its nice that they made it free,  but it should coast a lot more.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Not overly sweet. Subtle but, impressive communication of good core values.<br />Highly recommended. Language is clean and not a 'dark' motif at all.

B00915G6SU|1.0|After the leaving of Emily the Show was worse. Also the storylines showed less suspene. The Casey were more and more formated.<br />Now in Season 8 they got boring. Don' buy this crap. It's early enough, if you watch it on TV sometime. If you need.
B00D2CYU2W|3.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br /> While he was alive, Liberace did everything he could to prevent his adoring fans (mostly elderly women) from learning that he was gay. 'Behind the Candelabra' focuses on the flamboyant entertainer's private life, particularly on his long-term relationship with his much younger lover, Scott Thorson.<br /><br />Thorson met Liberace through a mutual acquaintance and gave up on his aspirations to become a veterinarian. Instead, in exchange for material (and sometimes) emotional support, Thorson became both Liberace's lover and personal assistant. Later, Liberace entertained ideas that Thorson could become his adopted son (much to Thorsen's chagrin, Liberace never made this official by signing the legal paperwork).<br /><br />Early on in this docudrama, Thorson receives a prophetic warning from one of Liberace's former 'concubines', that he too will be discarded by a younger rival. Along the way, Thorson agrees to undergo plastic surgery at Liberace's behest, who seeks to transform the younger man, into the spitting image of Liberace himself. As a result of the surgery, Thorson eventually becomes addicted to drugs, a situation which Liberace comes to despise.<br /><br />On the other hand, Liberace's penchant for patronizing pornographic shops bothers Thorson, who points out that doing so, could undermine all of Liberace's efforts to remain closeted. The straw that breaks the camel's back is when Liberace tosses Thorson aside for a younger rival, leading to Thorson's big meltdown, where he is unceremoniously escorted from Liberace's mansion, never to return until Liberace's final days.<br /><br />Take away the fact that this is Liberace, the over the top entertainer, known to millions, the domestic imbroglios between this gay couple, are nothing out of the ordinary. Should we really care when Thorson 'loses it' when Liberace dumps him? After all, it was strictly his decision to live an empty life where an elder benefactor provides all his material wants, at the expense of his own self-satisfaction. And does it really matter who's 'on top', during bouts of anal sex?<br /><br />Despite the mundane source material, which highlights the couples' self-destructive behavior, there are moments which suggest that both Liberace and Thorson, were at heart, decent people. Take Liberace doing so much for Thorson upon the death of his foster mother (like hiring the chartered plane); by the same token, Thorson is willing to forgive Liberace, and visits him at his deathbed, just as he's about to die from AIDS.<br /><br />Michael Douglas and Matt Damon do a decent enough job, recreating the roles of the two lovers; but I wonder if it would have been better if two actors who were actually gay, could have brought more to the parts. Debbie Reynolds is great, as well as unrecognizable in the role of Liberace's mother. And director Steven Soderburgh acquits himself well, in presenting this 'warts and all' portrait, of the offbeat showman.<br /><br />'Behind the Candelabra' may not be everyone's cup of tea not because the material is salacious but rather because it's a bit ordinary. That includes Liberace's music, which to my mind represented a combination of the sublime and the ridiculous. In the end, there's enough here to keep one's interest, but given the subject matter, don't expect any real epiphanies.or provides all his material wants, at the expense of his own self-satisfaction.

B000ZECQ08|5.0|When our grandkids started reading the Harry Potter books I became concerned but put it off and off.  I had found the Hobbit to be dumb until I reread it two more times and finally understood where that author was coming from....that only a Hobbit could turn away from temptation.  Then I endured the entire violent Rings thing.  Well. Okay.<br /><br />Then I read about this woman who has hard times and writes this stuff about this ordinary boy.  Boy.  Ordinary.  So any kid can identify with him.  Hmmm.<br /><br />Then I read the books.  Then my husband read the books.  Then we read the books aloud to each other...AGAIN! and AGAIN.<br />How could anyone create this stuff, even if it did seem as though we had read most of the things in someone else's writing first.  And tears &#34;leaking from his eyes&#34;  repeatedly used....not artful  But, oh, my gosh, how exquisite, how gripping.<br />And then out come the movies with these precious kids and these superb adult actors that we often later see in something like Stephen Sondheim's later version of Sweeney Todd:  The Demon of Fleet Street.  What talent.<br /><br />What direction.  The only criticism would be that the later movies do not have directors insisting on slowing down the kids' dialogues as well as the first two did.<br />The color, the creativity, the story, the acting, the people.<br />UNFORGETTABLE.  Everyone ought to get past the &#34;witch and wizard&#34; thing  and thinks about platform nine and three-auarters!<br /><br />What a marvel.  And we woulda missed it if we had been stuffy old people.  Shame, it would have been.<br />Thank you, all involved and especially Jo Ann Rowling.  You deserve every shilling you got!<br /><br />nancy and john morse
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This is a must read.  The ability to be part of the missions and also their lives was very intriguing and a story I will never forget.
B00AR83PN4|1.0|No good explanation of how the game works.<br />Seems pretty pointless.  Uninstalled the game right away.<br />Need something more interesting
B0070DOHQS|5.0|I use this on both my phone and my tablet, for both RDP and VNC connections. I've used a number of free solutions and they just don't have the feature set of this one. I have used trial versions of several commercial versions (like Jump, most of those are restricted to a single host) and the control scheme on Jump just feels better. I don't have any trouble accessing any features I would use a mouse for (which was a problem on some of the clients). I highly recommend you pick up the free version and give it a shot if you're looking for a good RDP or VNC client. If you just need it to access a single PC at home (or a bastion host) the free version should serve you well, but consider the paid version if you need to access more hosts.<br /><br />I have not installed the Jump desktop software which allows access to printers (and maybe more).<br /><br />I do use an alternate port for RDP (for security reasons) and Jump handles it just fine.<br /><br />I don't find any differences in using it between VNC and RDP hosts. The setup is a little different, of course, but once the client is configured I just choose the one I need to work on from the list and go.<br /><br />Mouse control is good on both my tablet and phone (though sometimes a little tight on the phone.) Long press to right click, and there's a set of modifier key buttons along the bottom that I can press if I want to Shift+Click or Ctrl+Click, for example. It does lack a center click, but I rarely miss that when working remotely.<br /><br />Pinch to zoom works well and quickly and the rendering is snappy and clean.<br /><br />Overall this has been a very good choice and I highly recommend it.
B0036EH3U2|5.0|Purchased the Blu-ray in the silver box, so no packaging issues. Has it all except the webisodes which were not that great (and licensing issues broadcast vs online probably prevent it anyways). Includes Razor and The Plan, extended episodes for several episodes such as Pegasus. Looks and sounds great (&#34;warts and all&#34;) in HD. Menu's and interface are fine, not confusing, easy to navigate.<br /><br />High points: Season 1 and 1st half of S.2; low points: some stand-alone episodes were pretty bad, like Black Market. The Plan was unnecessary, and &#34;the plan&#34; was just Cavil's evil (and ad-hoc) machinations, not the nuanced approach of the series as a whole.
B0060ANOXY|5.0|I have to say that I find Pink Floyd's Roger Waters' singing is deep, artistic, and brilliant at times.  I was mesmerized by his performance with Pink Floyd at the Concert for Sandy Victims on December 12, 2012.  This compilation is inspired by the first Persian Gulf War in 1991.  His music is far more than just sound but lyrical and meaningful at times. This compact disc is my first from Roger Waters and/or Pink Floyd and I'm not disappointed.<br /><br />You just have to listen to the music a few more times in order to capture the whole impact of the music and meaning behind it. The first time I heard Roger Waters was on the Lost Boys soundtrack where he sang \\"Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me\\" and it was far better than George Michael or Sir Elton John. Waters has a great voice and talent to speak with his music and capture the audience's attention. He sings with meaning and concern for the world around him.<br /><br />He should be awarded Knight Bachelor of the Order of the British Empire for his services to music.
B00005UW7V|5.0|My golly.  This is art.  This is beauty.  This is technology at its finest.  I have watched this many times.  It enables me to turn it on in my mind any time I wish to any part of it.  You think about values.  A whole lot.<br /><br />You develop compassion for what does not even exist.  You learn to wonder about whether or not........ any of this.<br />And discrimination of this kind.<br /><br />If you have read any of the history of the English Royalty - specifically, the Plantaganets -  you will never again be horrified at what anyone does to anyone.  This includes the native Americans way back when people came and took their land from them;  what the Chinese or the Japanese cruelties were;  the Germans.  The Russians in the Cold War.  And on and on,<br /><br />So, how come I mention these things in reference to this movie?  What is wrong with human beings that they have to hate and feel threatened.  There!  That's it!  Somebody wants to be leader.  Somebody wants a leader to latch onto.  And here we see the same thing...Fear...THEY might take over...then where will we be??????????//<br /><br />Wow!  Powerful, just too powerful not to want to see it.  Beautiful too.<br /><br />nancy morse
B005UKJX4E|2.0|What a waste of time, maybe it is something that should be showing in an art studio.  It was a let down, completely, as it lacked any depth of understanding.  Every time the movie attempts to give a message it fails as there is no completion of thought.<br /><br />I have no doubt that it was a failure in theaters.
B008U7ZPHS|5.0|This is an amazing book. In fact, it's my favourite Heroes of Olympus book. The plot of this book is complicated, with a new prophecy to guide the Argo crew. This was actually the first Rick  Riordan book I read. My friend showed me the book and told me to read it. I did and didn't regret it. This book seemed awesome, even though I didn't understand a lot about the histories of the characters. If you want to read this book, I say read all the Percy Jackon books and the two HoO books before this first.<br />My favourite character in this series (and the Percy Jackson series) is Annabeth. She doesn't have any magic powers like any of the others on the crew (except for Leo) but still makes a big impact on everyone using her incredible wits. No doubt that's one of the reasons why he likes her. She is a genius at concealing herself, and until you read this book you don't know the real Annabeth. She's such a complicated character, but that's what makes her interesting. And how she bravely faces her epic solo quest... that girl has guts. Big time.<br />The other narrators in this book were also good except for Piper. In the first HoO book, she struck me as a confident, non girly girl I could relate to. But in this book, she worries about Jason and Reyna too much, like she's obbesed about him. But other than that, she's a spunky girl wih charm, with the emphasis on charm. Percy's chapters were awesome as always. Leo, along with Percy, is my second favourite character. He has traits of the old Percy, but would never really hurt anyone in the crew. (There is a lot of drama between him and Frank.)<br />As said above, I think the plot is brilliant. My only reall issue with the book? Why did it have to end where it did?! I won't spoil the ending, but I can assure you it's definitely unexpected. It also makes you want to read the next book in the series, The House of Hades. Exactly four months until the book comes out, and the wait still seems like forever! It's gonna be a long four months 'til the books comes out.<br />This is an amazing book, and I definitely recomend it to readers who love fantasy, adventure, Greek and Roman mythology, or just Percy Jackson and the rest of the crew!
B000PMLFRA|1.0|We were all willing to overlook the silly Ewoks. They were entirely too adorable and obviously aimed at getting the most out of your merchandizing options, but at least they added a little something to the storyline.<br /><br />Then Jar Jar happened.  And Jar Jar begot Boss Nass, who begot an implausibly mobile Jabba the Hut; Jabba begot Watto, who begot Sebulba; Sebulba begot Fodesinbeed and the whole franchise became a thick, gummy CGI mess.  Then it seemed you couldn't stop yourself.  You ran rabid, plastering layers of gooey CGI scene-hoggery all over the heretofore flawless originals. Soon, the ultimate saga of good's triumph over evil became half a bucket of popcorn mixed with the sweepings of your last beard trim all spilled on the sticky theater floor: Unrecognizable and something to be avoided.<br /><br />Please, George.  We made you filthy, stinking, criminally rich. We're not asking you to kill Jar Jar or recast Anakin (although both are worthy requests - c'mon, Christensen was awful). All we ask is that you remaster the originals exactly as they appeared in theaters and re-release them on blu-ray. Please?
B00B7Y0206|2.0|Although it seemed easier to get to Youtube via this app one day I just got a message stating \\"v tube has stopped working.\\" So I removed it from my device. That's all. It didn't make ay big difference in terms of accessing or viewing Youtube (except that when it stopped working I was unable to get on Youtube without first deleting the v-tube app).

B004HZ14QS|3.0|The quality of compositions started to become spotty at this point in Weather Report's history. I had forgotten what some of these sounded like. I do like D flat Waltz, Fast City and Two Lines, and Where the Moon goes is a quirky piece that kicks into gear as it progresses. I think I like these because of the relentless rhythms and interesting percussion. D flat Waltz is apparently an early version - it does not include some of the cool quirks of the version on Domino Theory, which I like on the whole. Weather Report must have worked on some compositions in live shows before recording them, so they evolved. I have found some live audience and soundboard recordings of WR from their Night Passage tour, which are many times better than what is represented on this CD. I do like Omar and Victor - Zawinul and Wayne were lucky to find them to step in. On elast comment - the medley is an unfortunate garble of great WR pieces. It just doesn't come across well on this CD. I suggest one listen to this before purchasing.
B003V6L94Q|5.0|I like Zac Brown Band a lot.  This is as I expected, good music.  If you like this band, this is a real good CD.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is not so tough that you become frustrated, but each room becomes increasingly difficult lending interest to the game.
B0053O89WY|5.0|My favorite show of all time! Hilarious! Cannot wait for the next boxed sets/seasons to come out!  Bought the first five seasons for my hubby for his birthday.  Very good quality DVD's
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This 3rd book in the crossfire series is hot hot hot! I love the style of writing and the storyline. Highly recommend. Just a quick note, this book is not for the faint of heart or uptight people with reservations about sexuality.
145210655X|5.0|This is the simplest idea I and many others never came up with. So cute and funny at the same time. I bought for my 3 yr old daughter as way to get her into SW and to read to her more.

B0042JIL2E|4.0|I saw Imelda May on &#34;Later with Jools Holland&#34;, a show from Britain that showcases old and new acts.  I really got a kick out of Imelda and her band, very stylish and fresh.  I'm not sure how to describe the music, kind of jazzy rock-a-billy?  But really fun hoppin' music and a really tight band fronted by a stylin young lady that can really sing. Probably better than I thought and definitly worth it.  Give it a shot.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Can't stop playing! Though I would like if they had more updates and that kind of stuff<br />NEED MORE UPDATES! PLEASE!!!
B003YHSE7W|3.0|Despite some great effects sequences (especially at Monaco), this film just felt more muddled and devoid of real plot than the first. There is still pleasure to be had in reconnecting with the characters from the first film and it's not a 'bad' film, but you are just left feeling that it could have been so much more. However, audio and video quality, the price and the delivery were all top notch.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, but it wasn't my favorite of the trilogy.  I think it might make a decent movie with great special effects.
B008WCP2KG|1.0|Worst written movie ever, really - total waste of time, dancing parts were pathetic and boring.<br /><br />And yes, Showgirls is much more enjoyable compared to this piece of male crap movie.  At least with Showgirls, it's an enjoyable bad movie, the kind of 'funny-want-to-watch-it-whenever-its-on' type of entertainment because of the over-acting and over the top situations.  But Magic Mike?  you see a bunch of stupid stud guys strutting around, hanging with each other, drinking-druging-screwing and spewing the most God-awful dialogue i have ever heard in a movie (what the heck is wrong with Hollywood movies lately?)<br /><br />I caught this on HBO and only watched the last 30 mins, which was way too long but at least i didn't waste 2.5 hours of my life - i even switched channels, went back and forth, and never missed anything when I returned to the movie - Again, i'm sure there was no actual dialogue written, it was all 'shoot from the hip' and yell out a lot of \\"F-you\\", \\"F-'d up\\", \\"F-F-F-F-F-etc\\"...  yeah, that about sums up this really 'deep' movie (deep in pile of poop).
B005H9B2CE|5.0|I never knew about the movie until I saw the trailer for the new 'Thor 2', OMG, I missed the first one, so I went right to Amazon and watched it on my Amazon Prime Instant Movie.  Avengers is next, then I will be ready when 'Thor 2' comes to a theater near me.

Reading him and Adam Smith  in the  60s has kept me sensibly out of the stock market.....<br />His philosophy of having as much awareness as possible of what we DON'T know is so useful and fits in so well with the world as I perceive it really is.....I have been saying for at least 20 years that WE DON'T EVEN SEE ALL THE COLORS! (as he says), so how can we be so sure there is no God! Taken with some good sense, God is a free option (I never limited God to a 24-hour day, so that literal creation stuff is not a big either-or choice, it seems to me)....<br />I love it when his traders who blow up end up selling used cars in New Jersey, that line sounds good whenever it is used!.....I also love his knowledge of classic Greek and Latin thinkers, his appreciation for poetry (that's what I do best), and his use of representative fictional characters as examples of the smart, the stupid, and the evil.....<br />I have read BLACK SWAN-1ST & 2ND Editions  (found several good ones already), ANTIFRAGILITY (gave exercise a new meaning), and I am just finishing FOOLED BY RANDOMNESS (great description of the con on 157-8, that con is all over the web), have two smaller books and some articles from the internet, and WAITING FOR THE NEXT COMEDIC BOOK OF WISDOM!!!!<br />And one more thing, his appreciation of the wisdom that is possible (but not guaranteed) that comes with age. Thank you so much! Jane Stilwell<br />[[ASIN:081297381X The Black Swan: Second Edition: The Impact of the Highly Improbable: With a new section: \\"On Robustness and Fragility\\"]]
0345529057|5.0|great series for anyone. if you have watched the HBO series, then you must read the books to get the fully fleshed out story.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Oh George... how you torment us.  We love you... and you kill another Stark.  We hate you... and you suck us in deeper.  Your world is so real, I feel like I've left home when I come to the end of another book.
B008K8VDPU|4.0|Love all the options available in this app. Easy to use. I have had a lot of fun playing with this piano app.
B001F0WXY0|3.0|For a professionally published, $10+ ebook which is such a classic in its genre, I would have expected this book to be better edited. Lots of misspellings which should have been caught at the proofreading stage. Unfortunately a lot of them look like OCR-type errors.<br /><br />Otherwise, the same great read it always has been.
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|Very different from John Williams, but epic in its own right.  Unlike some people, I found myself humming along with some of the music while I was watching the movie.
B0053O89KG|5.0|Castle is my favorite show on TV. So glad I have it on disc to watch whenever I want! Great acting!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I had so much fun completing the first nine rooms with my kids!  It's a great problem solving game that even my 7 year old could do with minimal help.  Looking forward to more rooms!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!<br />I so can't believe you did that.  You didn't.  No.  No, I simply refuse to believe that you did THAT... of all things, THAT?!?!<br /><br />(Pshaw... you thought I was going to give out spoilers?!  Not likely.  Go read the books, fool!)<br /><br />Oh, George, how you play with our hearts.  I need to go have a good cry now.  Damn you, Mr. Martin, damn you.  (Yes, it is like THAT.  It is. *mope*)
B00CRMWMZ0|5.0|This is an amazeing soundtrack original music 5 stars I would recommend it to anyone looking to buy techno music.
B00CW665VI|5.0|'I prefer simple and straightforward. I work, I f***, I eat, I sleep, on Sundays I have brunch with my mother and play basketball with the guys. Effortless. Easy.'<br /><br />  That. Was. Hilarious!! I haven't laughed this much reading a book since Tara Sivic's Chocolate lovers series. I cannot believe this is a debut novel, I LOVED IT!!<br /><br />'here's a fact for you- once I'm done, I'm done. I'm not the kind of guy who rides the same rollercoaster twice. Once is enough, and then the thrill is gone and so is the interest.'<br /><br />  It wasn't an entirely new concept- rich playboy meets girl, boy wants girl, girl turns boy down, boy wants girl more and becomes obsessed, boy falls in love and then screws the pooch because it scares the hell outta him, throw in some hot HOTT sex & there you have it.<br /><br />'I'm not a bad guy. I don't lie; I don't sandbag women with flowery words about a future together and love at first sight. I'm a straight shooter. I'm looking for a good time-for one night-and I tell them so...<br />...But I can't help it if they see me, f*** me, and suddenly want to bear my children. That's not my problem. Like I said, I tell them how it is, give them a good time and then the cab fare home. Thank you, good night. Don't call me, 'cause I sure as s*** won't be calling you.'<br /><br />'Apparently, I've grown a conscience. I don't know when it happened, I don't know how it happened, but I am not happy about it. If I could, I would squash that Jiminy Cricket f***** like the roach he is.'<br /><br />  But here is where the originality shines through- it was told entirely from the male lead, Drew's POV. Being in that dudes head was a friggin riot. I laughed so hard tears were in my eyes. And the way the story is told, it's like hes relaying everything directly to you, which just added a whole new level of fun.<br /><br />'For those ladies out there who are listening, let me give you some free advice: if a guy who you just met at a club calls you baby, sweetheart, angel, or any other generic endearment? Don't make the mistake of thinking he's so into you, he's already thinking up pet names.<br />  It's because he can't or doesn't care to remember your actual name.'<br /><br />'First of all, if a chick wants me to respect her, she needs to act like someone worth respecting. Second, I'm not trying to be a d***; I'm just being a guy. And all guys talk to their friends about sex.<br />Let me repeat that in case you missed it: ALL GUYS TALK TO THEIR FRIENDS ABOUT SEX.<br />If a guy tells you he doesn't? Dump him, because he's lying to you.'<br /><br />  His interactions with Kate were sexy, funny, and just plain old awesome.<br /><br />\\"You are driving me crazy!\\"<br />\\"Crazy? Like you want to rip my shirt open again?\\"<br />\\"No. Crazy like the itch of a yeast infection that just won't go away.\\"<br />I flinch. Can't help it.<br />I mean-Christ<br /><br />  Then there is his family and friends, too friggin funny. His niece Makenzie was epic!<br /><br />\\"I see now why Alexandra started the Bad Word Jar, since you seem to spend so much time with Makenzie.\\"<br />\\"What do you mean?\\"<br />\\"She talks like you. It's not every day you hear a four-year-old say Prince Charming is a douchebag who's only holding Cinderella back.\\"<br />That's my girl.<br />\\"Swearing is good for the soul.\\"<br /><br />  I could keep going all day with the quotes-this book was full of fantastically hilarious dialogue. Seriously, YOU HAVE TO READ THIS BOOK!! Cannot wait for more from this author.<br /><br />'Men pretty much have sex on the brain twenty-four-seven. The exact figure is like every 5.2 seconds or some s*** like that.<br />The point is, when you ask, \\"What do you want for dinner?\\" we're thinking about screwing you on the kitchen counter. When you're telling us about the sappy film you watched with your girlfriends last week, we're thinking about the porno we saw on cable last night. When you show us the designer shoes you bought on sale, we're thinking how nice they would look on our shoulders.<br />I just thought you'd want to know. Don't shoot the messenger. It's a curse, really.'e, we're thinking how nice they would look on our shoulders.<br />I just thought you'd want to know. Don't shoot the messenger. It's a curse, really.'
078324228X|5.0|Movie came just as it was ordered; new. Never heard of the movie before, and I loved it. Great movie.
B000GL1BHO|5.0|excellent product, I love this dinosaur, my son loves that its design is very real not stop playing them takes him everywhere with him.The order came quickly without any against time, I recommend the seller.
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|If you have never seen this series, you are missing out.  The best series since the Sopranos.  Must watch show
1934030597|5.0|Book is big, so lots of information is in there, you need to read it (chapter) to find out what you need.<br />I would recommend it to my friend.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|There were hardly any instructions to this game. I had no idea what I was supposed to after solving a puzzle. I just randomly started tapping to see what would happen. I am so glad the game was free.
B00AR83PN4|4.0|Perfect set-up. Few ads, lets you play at your own pace. The six year old and the the sixty year old will like this game
0307341577|4.0|Gillian Flynn is one of my favorite authors.  She has a way with dark murder mysteries and this book lived up to expectations.
B007R21JJK|2.0|Im have some problems with this motherboard. The hdmi fails after loading screen either in Windows or in Mac OS (hackintosh). Everything else works fine, but i had to add a video card since the onboard video doesnt work anymore. If someone knows how to fix it i will apreciate it. Thanks
B0023SDPS6|4.0|I love this guy (Craig Johnson).  Think Tony Hillerman but funny!  Also Cheyenne instead of Navaho.  It's a great trip into their culture and a great story to boot!  I'm so glad I read the LA Times and found this author.  I will be reading him for a long time.
B003YVCJQ0|5.0|Welcome to Earth!<br /><br />We will not go quietly into the night, we will live on!<br /><br />and also, AMERICA yeah! woo!
B006L9B6TI|5.0|I love this book.  It gives you a 28 day plan of action to bring more wonderfulness into your life.  It's working for me.
B004T0E2S8|4.0|I came from the time when you actually had to read music or play by ear.  But having pretty much every song &#34;tabbed&#34; out for you is pretty awesome.  Although, I don't agree with some of the TABS, it definitely gets you in the ball park.  I've been able to find almost all of the songs I've searched for.
0307951154|4.0|Always like the Harry Hole Novels, they are different, not always a happy side of life, but very interesting.  Cannot wait for the next one.  S. Hunt
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|The new Black Sabbath album is awesome! The return of Ozzy Osbourne to Black Sabbath is incredible! The riffs just go to show that Tony Iommi is the guitar riff master!!!
B007EECSFA|2.0|Unexpected ending which developed for several of the last chapters, but the rest of the story was too drawn out and had me skipping sections.  Way too much superfluous writing of details that didn't add to the story line. This is my least favorite book of Kate Morton. Don't waste your precious reading time on it.  There are too many other great stories to be read.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game would recomend it to people. its a game where you need a lot of perserverence because one minute your on a log then another minute a tree. fell and your falling down a chasum.
B007L6VR12|5.0|This is a great story. Period. not a lot of show, not a lot of hype. Just a good, real type story played out by great actors.. It was a fun romp through a coming of age tale.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|its very fun and entertaining to play!! Also great for car rides long trips exc. if you don't have it you should get it!
B006LSZECO|2.0|This book had me going for a long time. I couldn't wait to get to the end to find out what other twisted stuff was going to happen. I was SO disappointed in the ending that it really just made me mad. It was like the author wasn't quite sure how to end the story and just gave it a \\"hurry up and end\\" ending.<br /><br />I only gave it 2 stars because of the ending. I'm a little hesitant to read her other books now.
B00BUADSMQ|2.0|LIKED BRUCE, BUT THE BRUCE AND SOMEONE ELSE NEXT TIME ILL WAIT AND GET IT AT TARGET 10.99 AFTER IT GETS OLD.
B005H5H3LW|3.0|I grew up watching \\"Star Blazers\\" so wanted to check<br />this out. Unfortunately it's nothing to write home about. Disappointed<br />with the casting of Derek (Kodai) and Nova (Yuki). The pacing is<br />too slow and the acting mediocre. Deslock's character was<br />glossed over. Japanese excel at animation and horror but Nipponese<br />live-action drama leaves much to be desired. I'm in the minority here<br />-- skip this unless you have lots of free time.
B007MDB71O|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie. It had so many elements that engaged my imagination.<br />Really wish that Disney would make a sequel.
B001N9ESQ4|4.0|The second in the series was as engaging as the first and the two actors must have had  an incredible personal  connection in order to project their on screen chemistry
B000028U0Y|5.0|I am by no means an avid JC fan, though do like his music.  I played this over and over on my last long range road trip and would recommend this to any Johnny Cash fan.
B00000IZOR|5.0|This is a classic toy.  Whether your child wants to pull it around or play with the actual phone it is well worth the money
B0078XFYDA|5.0|I enjoyed this book because I think this is a wonderfilled world we live in. The reality of this world goes far beyond any made belief world of religion or magic. We have to see what a beautiful place we have. Just going for a walk and seeing and hearing the life around us is amazing.
B0054SMID0|4.0|I really liked the storyline. I will have to read the book to see if the movie did it justice. No overacting by anyone.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Watched the first three movies that I've loved forever and I have to say this is the best looking and best sounding set of Blu-Ray I own. Hesitant to sit through Kingdom of Crystal Skull again, but I'll give it another shot. Worth the first three for sure.
B001NA6096|4.0|The acting was superb and VERY REAL.  in addition, the fact that only 2 people's dialog kept us engaged was also extraordinary
1781162646|5.0|As usual, King creates a great story full of great characters. A little slow to start with, but picks up speed and is a truly enjoyable read
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Hugh Jackman's range and power in this is phenomenal.  All of the actors did wonderfully well.  Casting of Russell Crowe for Javert inspired.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|Nothing these guys could do would ever top their early albums, just for nostalgia alone.  But I think this album is a very solid one.  It sounds very reminiscent of their first three albums to me.  Not really much branching out or experimenting, just more of what they were always best at.  If you like early Sabbath and can forgive the fact that Bill Ward didn't drum on this one then I think you will also like &#34;13&#34;.<br /><br />I was really worried about sound quality when I saw that Rick Rubin was producing it.  I thought his recording and production of Metallica's &#34;Death Magnetic&#34; was so horrible that it detracted from the music.  That recording has to be one of the worst ever with regards to noise and static (in my opinion).  I'm no audiophile but I thought this one sounded fine, or at least the recording wasn't so bad that it ruined the album for me.<br /><br />I purchased the deluxe edition with the 3 bonus tracks.  I thought they were just as good as the album tracks.  One thing I really liked was that the 3 bonus tracks were on a separate disc so you can listen to the regular album by itself if you like.
B008Y6QZ56|5.0|Great Guys movie with lots of cool fighting.<br /><br />You will love the fighting, but I am not sure how accurate story really is.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a really enjoyable game, I keep playing to try and get higher scores, I will recommend it to all friends.
B008JFUNYG|1.0|Not even close to the original in quality.  The evil spirit was much more fearful when you didn't know when it might possess someone.  In here it seems more of a virus that happens when you come in  contact via blood to blood with one that is.  In the old one the main character was possessed but only was freed through his love for his lost girlfriend.  Just another typical modern horror movie that seems to be rushed just to get another one in theaters.  I didn't even care to bother watching it when it came out because I expected it to be bad anyways.  I waited till it was free and now I wasted my time sigh.....
B008IJT0CE|5.0|My wife and i use this most nights to help us ease into sleep. we like how you can mix multiple sounds together.
1451695195|5.0|Loved this book and bought one for my best friend.  I found it to be a page-turner with a surprise ending regarding the heavenly guide. More importantly, Alexander's scientific rebuttals of responses the medical community makes to reports of after-life experience were satisfactorily compelling.<br /><br />(On another note: I found some experiential support of chakra energy theory in his ascent from the brown underworld through the yellow spinning place and upward to the vaulted highest center. An imperfect mapping of the 6 chakras but a pitch-perfect rendition of the 3 he recalled.)
B000A7S4B0|5.0|I LOVE this band.  I was on the phone with my brother and we were watching a scuba diving video a friend had made and they had used &#34;Beat the Devil's Tattoo&#34; as the soundtrack.  We were both immediately more captivated by the music than the video and had to figure out who it was.<br /><br />Now I've bought all of their studio albums and I think this one might be my favorite.  From some of the reviews I'd read I thought this one might be more of an &#34;unplugged&#34; type of album but it's not really.  It is mellower than their others and it has (to my ears) a very Beatles/Stones kind of sound but it also reminds me some of U2's Joshua Tree and Rattle & Hum.  A lot of the songs have almost a gospel or folk hymn kind of quality to them.  But hymns done the way only BRMC could do them.  There's a lot of blues on this album too.  And I want to say some bluegrass but honestly I'm not too familiar with bluegrass so maybe that's not really accurate.  But it still rocks hard enough for me.<br /><br />&#34;The Line&#34; was easily the standout track that I'll listen to over and over and over.  But that's not to say that the rest of the album doesn't hold up.  These guys have quickly become one of my absolute favorites and this album just might be their best.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|I thought this game was pretty good. It definitely takes advantage of the tablet's capabilities by using touch-based and orientation-based puzzles. I loved it.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Sounds like a funny title but really watch and it'll make since. A crazy thrill ride with lots of ups and downs. All bad deeds catch up with you in the end.
B006LSZECO|3.0|While the book is entertaining, it is implausible to the point of getting annoying. I enjoyed reading the book, but was ultimately let down in the end. The ending was original just too unbelievable to give a higher rating
B005LAIIJY|5.0|Classic Quentin Tarantino movie. There was at least one period piece error but other than that I would recommend it.
B0098VXDDS|3.0|From the first seasons with the actor who passed away it seems as the shows have become much more cheesey and foul with the language.  Enjoyed the first 2 seasons
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It is a great game. It is not too hard but you won't pass the level if you don't think about it .
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I believe that this is a fine piece of art!  Suzanne Collins is a great writer and I am looking forward to the movie.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Gun fighter, slavery,  and loads of fun. Usually dont get into westerns but this one was cool. Django is that one in a thousand not to be missed.
B006GWO5NE|1.0|Unfortunately this cable made no difference whatsoever with respect to charging my kindle.  The port on the kindle is still very loose and the cable made no difference.  This was recommended by a technician for kindle to try and did not work.
B000066744|5.0|I stumbled across this wonderful flik one evening, & was marvelously entertained with the story,.....<br /><br />I particularly love how the star Improvised a song by transposing a personality to music.<br /><br />Id have prefered a happier ending something like,....he at least went off to find the girl,....or attempted to move on in life, theres always another ship etc....<br /><br />such as it was ITS A KEEPER worthy of a place in my Library.
B006BGZJJ4|1.0|i did not get it i got it last week is a bad cable  you shod get minecraft pe plz
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Very sad first episode, I love the grandness of the Abbey. Be prepared for a shocking season finale it will really surprise
B004DSX5B6|4.0|I really like this tool - good quality - very useful tools.  Only one strange problem with it that I keep thinking maybe I'm missing something: some of the tools like saw blade are nearly impossible to get out unless you have fingernails or something else to stick into the small space.  Maybe there is some trick I haven't figured out yet.. I hope so, because otherwise its great.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|Misdirection, mystery, action, humor, romance and the inevitable heroics of Jack Reacher make The Affair one of the most compelling books in the series. A great read.
159463176X|4.0|I loved  Hosseini's first two books. While I didn't like this one as much and the first two, it was still a great book. I recommend all three of his books for anyone who has any interest in what life really like is for Afghan people and how hard they have to work to just survive. I had a hard time putting the book down once I started reading.
B00008GKEG|5.0|Great condition. Sadly, I realized the day before our christmas night that he had it already. However, the product arrived in perfect shape and condition, and well packaged. Nothing negative about it to say. I returned it without any trouble.
B006GWO5NE|1.0|In the rare instances I can get the cable to stay in my daughter's Kindle Fire it works well.  However, in order to keep the cable in place long enough to charge the Kindle it has to be tied to the device.<br /><br />As things stand currently she'd rather charge it slowly using a spare Kindle One cable that we have.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved the movie and the book. Wish I had read the book before seeing the movie. I liked the plot of the book better than the movie.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Great book I love the books so far, I'm on the next one and I'm sure I will love it.
B00DHNAQ2Y|5.0|I've not seen the original so I'm coming to this Evil Dead a virgin.  Never in all my life have I watched a movie and had a conversation with it at the same time.  Explain this, I'm laughing with horror only because my emotions were exhausted I was looking, not looking, pausing, restarting - look...no I can't....go ahead....ok.  I can only say WATCH IT fool, go ahead.  Don't even think about it.  I bought it and I've only bought 2 or 3 films on Amazon.  I'm glad I did!  This film outshines all others as the ***** all around, scariest, bloodiest, gore, clenching, screaming out loud movie of all time.  YEA EVIL DEAD....YOU ROCKED MY WORLD BABY!
1609611543|4.0|This is a really educational book but too much scientific detail for me.  I realize that most of our food is tampered with and full of GMO's I didn't know about Frankenwheat till I read this.  Wheat free is very hard to do, but I am.
B005U9REU0|4.0|Love is a strong word, but lets just say I really, really, really like it. I had seen this a few times before. I'm a fan of Jim Henson and his creative team.
B008602KQI|5.0|I was pleased with the dvd, in perfect condition. The movie is one that can be watched over and over. Intense! Filmed in parts of North Carolina, the scenery unsurpassed—in my opinion. My trust in purchasing from Amazon is more than the five star rating, they have been number one for our family, in product condition and prompt service. I say: You can shop at Amazon with confidence.
B009UAO1ZG|5.0|Loved Lyn Olson's Citizens of London and always wondering what can be written that would shed new light on a period already so well researched but this book delves into so much material about the isolationists vs the interventionists in the US and how they were viewed in the media. Learned a great deal about various leading personalities who fought relentlessly for one side or the other and it is a fascinating read.
B0053Q9DHW|3.0|the movie condition was great but i thought the movie itself was kind of blah. i read the book and it was much better than the movie
B008NMT684|5.0|Got this for my 3 year old grandson...he loves it. He loves anything trucks and we discovered that after you complete the puzzle you can pop the balloons. It keeps his attention for long periods of time. I only wish there were more vehicles.
B001AGXEA6|5.0|This was one of my all time favorite movies from childhood. I am so glad that this was available on blue ray.
B009AZZEU2|3.0|This CD was enjoyable to listen to and has some solid songs but like others have stated there are truly no standout songs. The nice thing is the classic Soundgarden sound is evident here. I can only rate it 3.5 stars as it certainly does not in any way compare to Louder Than Love or Bad Motorfinger, but still a fine effort and worthy of owning if you are a Soundgarden fan.
B004LM72ZY|5.0|I got this for my grandson who wanted to have something like his older brother. Perfect! Highly recommend it. Excellent buy.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|Daria, that outcast, smart-mouthing girl with the smart and artistic Jane to compliment. I simply loved this show as a teen and find it still relevant as an adult. Daria seems to say what we all deep down are thinking on our gloomiest days, only she shows it and isn't afraid to bother or be &#34;in your face&#34; about it. It's the fact that it's simply a part of who she is, a part that she embraces, contrary to what everyone else encourages, which makes it &#34;in your face&#34;.<br />I recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good laugh and witty sarcasm!
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Lots of skipping back and forth in time was confusing and did not add to the story.  There were a lot of characters to keep track of and this skipping around did not help.
B000IZA9NK|4.0|I really enjoyed the movie.  The special effects were decent considering the age of the film.  The story line was good.  Real good entertainment.
B00A77II0U|5.0|I enjoyed playing this game. He has hidden objects and puzzles both of which my husband and I love in a hidden object game.
B0095VPAVE|5.0|My grandmother was looking for a new computer and was going to buy a 800+ laptop for no reason.<br /><br />I picked-up one of these bad boys with a Micro-atx board, 8GB of ram & a 430W psu for about $250 (already had the cd player, hardrive & case).<br /><br />Works well and really can't say anything bad about it.<br /><br />Note:<br />Don't forget to install the drivers for the apu otherwise you will get terrible performance.<br /><br />Part list:<br />[...]
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|This is a must buy for gaming. I have an HD 7870, and this CPU actually help the gaming side.
0062014102|5.0|Fascinating material wish I had found this years ago.The author deftly mixes science facts and a enjoyable discussion. Thoroughly recommend. Very sad the author passed away only a year after it's publication.<br />This is for anyone interested in finding out who and what they really are.
B005FDW7AI|4.0|We need to believe in our loved ones.and if we r good one day life will be good to us.

B00DC7N9NS|3.0|Was disappointed in the graphics. Had high hopes for this movie. Story line was great but the wicked witch... Her voice didn't match the part at all. Sounded like a whining teen. Could tell they edited in some one elses voice for her cackle.
0307592731|5.0|She wrote beautifully. If you like books on hiking then this is worth it. LOVED IT!!! Made me tear up at some parts
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Django is in line with old Clint Eastwood films with a modern twist towards the positive.  Same quirky music, action scenes were excellent and overall a very fun experience.  We hope Jamie Foxx continues on and makes additional movies using this same theme...<br /><br />Loved It!

B00DGMVJAO|3.0|movie dragged on a little bit and was pretty predictable, but wasn't bad. It made the time pass like I needed it to.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. I've played other G5 games, but this one is the best by far. So much game for the money! The story kept my interest, the puzzles were fun...challenging, but not impossible. I would highly recommend this game!

B000W4KT6E|5.0|My grandson has loved this movie since he was 12 months old and his cracked because of all the use, litterally, 6 times to and from a car trip to Florida!! It replaced that one and filled a very important gap.
B00AK77WPE|4.0|I do not like that music, it was a present for my husband and he enjoyed a lot with his friends
B00BP4Z8XY|3.0|Movie rags on and on. Wasn't even entertaining enough for my 3 year old daughter to keep her attention for 5 min.
B005KISHDY|5.0|Good scaling, and a lot of fun to put together. Lots of playability and detail make this set a great value.
B006IGZX0C|5.0|I loved the movie!  I read the book, and I wasn't sure the movie could be as good. But it was outstanding. The actors did a good job of being believable too. Well done!

B004JN1D2I|5.0|Buy it. You won't regret it. Here are some additional words that Amazon requires for me to be able to complete this review.
1400064287|5.0|This was a book club read, but I got so much out of it that instead of borrowing it from the library, I bought it. I refer back to it and continue to learn exactly what the authors had intended.
0061124958|5.0|When I asked my grandson what he wanted for his upcoming 7th b-day, he told me how they read this book in school and he really liked it. So, when he opened his gift and saw this-he was super excited and I was so glad I purchased this for him.
B001HPP2XW|5.0|I absolutely love this movie! It's my all time favorite, and getting the centennial collection was just a cherry on top! I would recommend this movie to anyone!
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|I'm still a fan of the classic original and this is quite a departure from that (even though that may have been the intent).  It was an interesting take on doing the story from the perspective of Oz but definitely think the classic was much better!
B006LSZECO|3.0|I enjoyed the book, &#34;Gone Girl&#34;,  by Gillian Flynn and it's psychological play from both Nick and Amy.  BUT --  I did not like the ending.  Nothing ends up being resolved and it is sad to think that any couple could live in a marriage like theirs.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|Great book.  Unlike some authors this author continued to up her game in each book in the series.  Each couple is unique. Can't wiat for the next one.  I had the luxury of reading all the books one after the other which which was awesome.
B003L77GRO|5.0|If you haven't watched Dexter yet the you need to. I've purchased every season since the beginning and this one was no disappointment.
B00ANA27IU|5.0|Having seen the movie multiple times, I had yet to read the book. Like Clarke's other works, 2001 dopes not disappoint.
B003MC5N28|5.0|this is a book that you can't put it down! I recommened with my friends.  A+ must read book. MS
B007ZGBZHE|1.0|I am a fan of Preston and Child's, but in my opinion this is not one of their better books.  The action scenes are not believable at all.  I wouldn't buy it again.

B00BGV0Y26|5.0|This has to be one of the better bands I've heard in the last five years. I'm an old school rocker that watched metal grow from its infancy into the thrash movement and finally into the mainstream of rock and roll. This band incorporates all the best of rock and metal. With vocals as powerful as Ann Wilson and rifs as edgy as late 80's and early 90's Metallica this has something for anyone that likes it hard and loud. Discovered the band through a Bud Light commercial and fell in love when I checked out their music on Spotify. Bought both albums and the EP. Well worth the price of admission. Buy it! Seriously, it kicks...buy it!
B00C6B9XCW|2.0|I'm going to get this out of the way first: I absolutely LOVE the Scott Pilgrim comic books.  I think they're great, they're different, they do a great job of making interesting characters, interesting dialogue, a novel premise and fun situations showcased with simple, minimalistic yet perfectly fitting artwork.<br /><br />The gist of the story is this: Scott Pilgrim is a teenager entering adulthood.  He has a band, lives with a friend (who's gay) and has a girlfriend who still goes to high school.  He then meets Ramona Flowers, literally the girl of his dreams, and falls for her.  The problem is, Ramona has seven evil ex boyfriends, and Scott has to defeat them if he intends to go out with her.  The premise sounds quite ridiculous, and, to be fair, it is, but it's not really bad.  And, of course, it's quite original.  The comics do a good job of pretending to be just this story about normal teens up until the point in which the exes are revealed, and it feels both fresh and exciting.<br /><br />But the movie... I just... can't... I didn't even watch the entire thing.  I had to stop it at little more than halfway because I was going to fall asleep.  And I don't know what the problem is.  All the elements are there, and for the most part, they remain the same.  Hell, I don't even have the classic \\"Oh, it's Michael Cera playing himself again\\" complaint, since he's easily the best part of the film.<br /><br />What is it, then?  Is it the fact that they shortened the story too much?  That shouldn't be a problem, since rarely direct adaptations bother me that way.  I had no problem with Jurassic Park, Harry Potter or even Watchmen.  I think the problem is that they do the opposite.  They don't take away enough.  Instead of keeping less elements and giving them more time to develop, they keep all the elements and they rush them, which makes the movie feel hyperactive, like it's all the time on fast forward.  I really think the movie is too worried with becoming the cult hit the books are, and it doesn't really finds its own place.<br /><br />Now, taking into account the fact that this movie, while not very successful financially, it's still well regarded, I believe it's pretty obvious that it actually has become quite the cult hit, but it's probably not for the reasons the filmmakers were expecting.  This movie manages to catch a few of the good things from the book: it's fresh, it's different, it has interesting characters, a novel premise and eye-popping visuals.  But the problem, I feel, is that it fails fundamentally in the storytelling sense.<br /><br />I don't know, I was supposed to be the target audience for this film, but I find the excess of action monotonous and boring, if that makes any sense.  I give the movie credit for being different, but I can't help thinking it would have been so much better if they slowed down a little.  Maybe if they had split it in two films instead.  Or if at least they removed the less necessary elements.it the books are, and it doesn't really finds its own place.<br /><br />Now, taking into account the fact that this movie, while not very successful financially, it's still well regarded, I believe it's pretty obvious that it actually has become quite the cult hit, but it's probably not for the reasons the filmmakers were expecting.

B00AN0KGWE|5.0|I do not subscribe to HBO so I did not see Game of Thrones. I purchased it for my Kindle HD and it is truly amazing. The screen intensity of  my Kindly HD is terrific for this show's beautiful scenery and constumes. This shows has it all..but adults only please. It has characters you care about, action, realistic looking costumes, plot twists that you really did not see coming at all. I am not a huge fantasy fan but this is more like Lord of the Rings which I loved. I cannot wait until Season 3 is available for my Kindle!

B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|My son actually had me remove this game from my Kindle after playing it for 30 minutes.  He declared, &#34;That game is dumb, get rid of it and I'll get something else.&#34;  Which never happens, so I trust it's just a badly designed game for kids.

0385349947|4.0|First I want to commend Sandberg for bringing the topic of women and leadership into conversation in a big, buzzy way. She includes much of the critical gender research describing how women are dismissed, ignored or devalued, except when their ideas are too good not to steal. She believes the solution to many of the world's ills is more women in power. I agree! But we really differ about how to get there. And what power and success mean. I dislike the term \\"lean in\\", which women are already breaking their backs doing. Bending, inclining, sloping, slanting, slouching and slumping to fit their feminine power and vision into the narrow structure and goals of most institutions and organizations. On p. 15 she says \\"There are so many reasons for this winnowing out [not enough women in the pipeline] but one important contributor is a leadership ambition gap.\\" I gnash my teeth. Here Sandberg echoes previous articles in Fast Company (\\"Where Are the Women?\\"2004) Harvard Business Review, Forbes, which imply women are leaving the road to success to raise their children, not tough enough to stand the heat in the kitchen. No, they just want to be cooking up something new. Sandberg is in familiar if completely mistaken territory with this fable. Women are plenty ambitious. They are not off-ramping to take care of children, fine a reason as that is. They are not leaving the workforce but leaving to start their own businesses, or find less toxic cultures to work in. To be able to contribute to the larger world, to have their contributions valued and appreciated, to make a difference. The off ramp, the pipeline, the ladder, even the jungle gym metaphor Sandberg uses, and her statement that a career is like a never-ending marathon, are classic masculine archetypal images. And the goals of such organizations are not sustainable for people or planet.<br /><br /> It is true that women tend to underestimate their talent and competence, where men overestimate theirs, and Sandberg rightly encourages them to raise their hands and sit at the table. I say: Build your own tables and redefine success and power for yourselves.Women do need to strengthen their trust in themselves, their inner authority, knowing, vision. One tool that helps is learning about the powerful correspondences between women's ways of knowing and changing and the  emerging new science and evolutionary consciousness. They are both expressions of the archetypal feminine. The need for more women in positions of leadership is not a women's issue, nor only an issue of social equity. It is an urgent need for the entire world community to transform the meaning of power, success, leadership. Bringing feminine values, visionary power and enormous capacities for creativity is a leap into a different way of working and governing, that could help create \\"a world in which it will be easier to love\\" (Paulo Freire). So follow Arianna Huffington on the Third Metric, read Meg Wheatley \\" Leadership and the New Science\\",  Sally Helgesen, especially her recent book \\"The Female Vision\\" with executive coach Julie Johnson, or Riane Eisler on creating a caring economy. What could change the world? if women regain their power. And leap wholeheartedly into the work that has meaning for you, your values, your vision.

B00C81AVNU|5.0|Congratulations to Cyndi Lauper for creating a true Broadway musical.  The score is delightful.  It has songs that you will leave the theater singing.  You will probably be dancing too.  Ms. Lauper deserved her Tony win.  I can hardly wait to see the show.

1936850028|5.0|There are a handful of world class events in the world of Cross Country Skiing. Those type of events  that you gear your life around (like the Boston Marathon in running), one of them is here in the USA and that's The American Birkie!<br /><br />Walter Rhein depicts accurately and in a fun rhythm what this race is all about, history and what it takes to train for it.<br /><br />I haven't raced the American Birkebeiner (yet) but certainly, reading Beyond the Birkie Fever has inspired me to take up the challenge and to personally live the book and maybe to be part of the American Birkie history.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I loved this book because it shows me  that even a neurosurgeon , with all the scientific knowledge had, he knew his body was witnessing much more than electrical impulses whilst in his coma. I believe that evidence of Heaven can be seen in many different ways and this is just one more.<br /><br />Great book and I would recommend it to anyone who may doubt Heaven or may be afraid of what happens after death.amazing.

1439152799|4.0|How do you criticize great writing? You don't. But you can have an opinion on what didn't work in it FOR YOU, rather than singing with the choir all the things that were wonderful.<br /><br />Morton is a great writer. Her description paragraphs nail setting, plot, etc. I feel like I am walking with the narrator through the castle, on to the property...<br /><br />My one complaint is something \\"I\\" was instructed not to do in writing classes. OVER describe. Morton is SO in love with the written language, sometimes, for me, she seems to tell too much. Most writers don't tell enough, but Morton IMHO needs to edit some of that fabulous language. Not all of it, just some of it. At one point in the novel, I felt I'd already read that chapter. I couldn't quite pinpoint where or how, but I knew I'd heard this before. This is, of course, the design of shifting narrators, one telling their story, another discovering that story, but the actual words were familiar. I didn't feel this way about The House at Riverton. THAT novel was much more tightly edited, IMHO.<br /><br />Not to criticize Morton in particular. THIS might be a trend. I felt several popular works of fiction in the last few years needed serious editing. The Host by Meyer, mann, cut a third woman! Even a few Harry Potters seemed a bit long in the tooth on description. I'd read it earlier in an earlier novel. I chalked it up to the absolute frenzy Rowling had to write to satisfy her hoards of fans. And maybe even her publisher barking at her heels! FASTER, FASTER, DEADLINE!!! The gripping fear that the phenom would end before the series did would account for this, I suspect.<br /><br />But this isn't so with Morton. Each of her novels is unique and stands alone. And although there is a drive to write fast and publish sooner, I think she has more ... time ... to edit the richness of her text.<br /><br />Maybe the new school of editorial assistants allow their massively creative authors more flexibility. After all, no one but the writer knows what it is that drives their story. I've often thought books in another era were as much written by the editor as the author (Gone With The Wind?, Ulysses?). Not fair, but that's what I've thought.<br /><br />With The Distant Hours, I've put the book down for days, not something I did with Riverton. I'm still fascinated by Edie's tale, or is it really Juniper's tale?...I wanted to know what happened, but sigh, I could wait until I picked it up again.<br /><br />I'm now at the eleventh hour, and I don't know how it will end. I have suspicions...and hopeful of a zinger at the end. I'm leaving all that for tonight...or even tomorrow, yawn, if I don't get to it tonight. I love the writing, I even like the supernatural and gothic style of the book (my absolute favorites are these...The Thirteenth Tale, Her Fearful Symmetry, The Eight, anything by Poe, most by Susan Hill).<br /><br />So I think a 4 not a 5 is closer to what I mean, but maybe a 4 1/2 star rating.<br /><br />Read this if you read other Kate Morton books. Heck, read it even if you don't read other Kate Morton books. Just ... well, I dunno, just know she's been better. A bit. ;0)one but the writer knows what it is that drives their story.

B00ALKO9WE|5.0|A thought provoking novel, I only wish I had read it as a teenager. As an adult it still rings true but I think all young adults would benefit from reading this!
B009NQZVKG|5.0|Any criticism of the content aside, the writing is superb and the characters and character development even better. From Seichan and her mother, Duncan and Jada, Gray and Seichan,and the exquisite Vigor and Rachel, we have four novels worth of powerful, believable and heart wrenching relationships in one excellent adventure. The skillful portrayal of these relationships truly trumps any eye rolling or eye glazing with the quantum science involved. Oh, and I forgot, any story with Atilla the Hun AND Ghenghis Khan has to be a WINNER!!

Turns out it is not so much fun and it does have a collector's value to some measure.  Let's just say, it is better than Gia?

B00AN0KBJC|5.0|I was reluctant to purchase this series as I'm usually unhappy with transition from book to film. I've just finished Season Two and I don't have a single criticism. So far, Martin's work has been followed to the letter and accurately depicted as written. Beautiful cinematography and flawless acting.
0525425772|5.0|I am so glad to see John Grisham devoting his writing to books for young people.  Bill O'Reilly is doing the same thing, and I recommend both authors to people who want their children to read quality material.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Like the game! Its raining here and this game is keeping me entertained...can't ask for more. Lol I like it.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Funny even for adults, can't wait to see the second one now, will watch it again for sure, has a good story to it
B002RI9UBS|4.0|I really enjoyed reading the book however this is one example of reading the book before seeing the movie. As I read, I kept visualising the numerous scenes and situations depicted. In hindsight, I felt this took some of the gloss of the book.
B008XGW1CI|2.0|JK Rowling's foray into non-Harry Potter writing. As a British expat I had been craving a touch of \\"home\\" and thought this would give it to me. It didn't. It's heavy, hard to get into and it took me months to read - I kept putting it down to read other books, and only came back because I hate to leave a book unfinished. It's done now. Thankfully.
B0060V1WJ6|5.0|The line Ryan Gosling tells Steve Carrell, \\" your wife left you because you lost sight of who you are as a man and as a lover \\" pretty much sums up what this movie's plot revolves around.  Ryan takes Steve under his wing after overhearing him tell and retell his sob story at a bar, and helps him step his game up.  I found it inspirational.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|I love this game so much . It is very fun I love the full version u will love it to
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I can't wait for the next one. Please hurry and get it out. So worth the read. Love the story.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|My boyfriend is the reason I started playing and now I'm addicted! So if you like card games this is the one
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Great game, addicting, and great time passer. Missions sometimes are tied to friends and that is only drawback for me.
1401900526|5.0|Anything Louise Hay puts out there is inspiring and worth getting, I put all my cards in a big bowl and then reach in each day to pick out what to think of and be positive about that day!

B001ANSSDC|5.0|Great character buildup and a great story line. Pat Peoples is a classic anti-hero, I love him! I am now a firm beliver in silver linings now.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subway surfers is a realy interesting game, there is a character for everyone and many different boards ands goals to try to earn.i only wish some characters had specific boards matched to them.
0316069884|4.0|This is a well-written, worthwhile book, and I recommend it to anyone interested in the subject.  However, it wasn't quite what I was looking for when I bought it.  It was recommended to me as an \\"objective\\" take on the issues surrounding eating animals, but it is emphatically not that.  Foer is extremely passionate and not remotely objective on the subject.<br /><br />That's not to say the book is necessarily inaccurate or poorly-documented- in fact, it is painstakingly well-reported (although there are no footnotes in the text, so you have to look to notes at the end of the book and then and manually look back to the text reference to find sources for most things).  Its just that the book is absolutely a polemic, and not a detached piece of writing.  There's nothing wrong with that- again, its a very good book- but it wasn't what I was looking for.<br /><br />One other note- the title, and the vast majority of the text, refer to \\"eating animals,\\" i.e., the issues surrounding deciding whether to eat meat.  For the most part, the book does not discuss whether to consume other animal products (like milk and eggs).  For instance, Foer almost always refers to \\"vegetarian(ism)\\" as opposed to \\"vegan(ism).\\"  But most of his arguments (and some parts of the text) apply with equal or greater force to consumption of milk and especially eggs.  Indeed, my edition (the paperback) included a post-publishing interview with the author, in which he spells out that he thinks the chicken egg portion of the industry is much worse than the beef cattle portion.  Its a huge difference vis-a-vis how easy/hard it is for someone to carry out in practice, so I would have liked him to clarify and discuss the difference.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|I was a little hesitant about reading this book but once I started I was drawn in and captured by it Morgan Rice has put together a great read
B008S80P38|5.0|It came on time and it was sent to the exact address that i wanted it to go too. It was for my boyfriend as a surprise and he truly was surprised!!! this is his favorite album and artist and he was really happy with what i got him. The price is great and I recommend this person/item for anyone thats interested in this music. Most definitely this is a 5 star product and i see myself buying from this seller again in the future.
0525953728|5.0|brought you inside of seals missions.  excellent plan that brought the desired results. seal sare the best in the world thanks
B0090EJ99A|2.0|All the funny parts of the movie were in the trailer....Sacha has gotten worse with each movie.  I would not recommend wasting your time on this one.
1577314808|5.0|I recommend Tolle's book wholeheartedly. He starts from the premise that the only thing that exists is the present moment and that to be happy you have to be in the now not the past or the future. Tolle states that that is the key to happiness. The book then points out the ramifications of dwelling in the past or waiting for the future. This book is so thought provoking that I am rereading it. I truly believe that almost anyone can benefit from reading The Power of Now.
0307341550|5.0|All singing aside, this book gave me the chills!<br /><br />What lacks in a slow beginning, makes up for in the exciting halfway mark right up to the end.  I remember picking it up before bed one night, at about 150 pages in, thinking I'd read \\"a few pages\\" before I fall asleep, when I looked at my clock and realized it was 2AM!  This is one of the few books that can make you despise almost all of the main characters, but still keep you glued to their every move.  I'm usually pretty quick to guess (correctly) the plot and just when I thought I was right, I had been slapped across the face with a whole new conclusion.  I love this book by Gillian Flynn - even more than Gone Girl.
0374533571|5.0|This is simply a beautiful story. The narrator's voice is refreshing and the mother's love is uplifting. I didn't know what to expect when I started reading (I have not seen the movie), and  thought it would be emotionally draining to read it,  but it was the contrary! I am so glad I read it.
B0007TKNII|5.0|Purchased. For 10 year old great granddaughter, she has watched it a dozen times. Practices songs from movie constantly. A beautiful love story.
B005544V6A|5.0|AWESOME!  I think the character are well deserving of one another,  they compliment one another well.  Just wonderful Story plots in each segment.
B0083Z614S|3.0|This book was simple to read and had a very good message. The Yorkshire was hard for me to understand at times. The last chapter was the most interesting.
0385344228|3.0|First, let me start out by saying that the plot and twists in this book are amazing.  Even now, when someone asks what the book was about, I get excited telling them all the juicy details.  However, I feel that the delivery of the book could have been better.  All those twists and turns in the book, never really jumped out and grabbed me - it wasn't until later, when I was retelling the story to a friend that I realized how great those events were.  I understand the author is trying to make the story personal by having it told by the father, but it becomes boring and repetitive.  Overall, I would not want to read it again and probably would not recommend to a friend.  Although, if it's ever made into a film, I would love to watch the story played out.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is the best! I've played numerous virtual pet games in the pas and I have to say this is my all time favorite! The graphics are amazing, the game play is fun and just the right amount of challenging, and of course the horses are wonderful. I definitely recommend this to any horse lover!!
B000UVT3OI|5.0|This cd is everything I expected it to be. It's a really good deal looking at the price and the product. Well worth my money and then some. With amazon I got my order two days earlier than expected on multiple items. I love this site!!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This app is good.  Can not save each level so always need to restart. Need to rate before I can go on.  Do not know if this is b/c it is a free app. This app is challenging and makes you think about items you found and how they can be used in the escape.
B004LLDN3A|5.0|...wish more movies were made like this.....whole family can watch and enjoy, laugh.....great songs, and dance..............roger's and hammerstein really had it going
B00BUADSMQ|5.0|Worth every dime you spend on Love itthis movie.  I love Bruce Willis and will buy all of his  movies.  This one is the best yet
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Great action scenes, enjoyed the story line and special effects.  The only thing I do not like is that all of the super hero movies are rated PG-13 yet everything is marketed to much younger children.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game is very addicicating but is very fun i love almost everything but it freezes a lot for me and it kinda gets anoying
B001B51B9M|1.0|Got my Music Man Blu Ray disk in a hurry.  Problem is it doesn't work on any blu ray player I've tried it on.  There's the deal.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|The middle class is eroding, your boss hates you, traditional education costs are spiraling out of control, and underemployment is probably above 20%. It's time to Choose Yourself!<br /><br />James does a great job inspiring us all to take responsibility for our own destiny. Forget purpose, find out what really makes you happy, and make positive changes to make yourself a better person, living a better life. Help other people, nurture your network, learn from failure, become an idea machine, stop making excuses, educate yourself (without college) and make it happen.<br /><br />The book is short but is jam packed full of value. I almost gave the book four stars because it's a bit raw and even sloppy in places. The reality is that the overal practical value of the book is a clear five stars. There's room for improvement, but that doesn't change the fact that it's a must read. I'd much rather have pure truth than well polished half truths and platitudes found in many books.
B00DBSZT7C|4.0|If you think this is going to be much like the old story, think again.  Don't buy it and expect that childhood tale.  This movie was definitely action packed.  I don't believe I'd let young children watch this due to the violence factor, but older ones will be ok.  I liked the special effects and watching this one in HD is great.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed Season 3. Liked that it was free to me as a Prime member. Prime needs to continue to offer good choices for its prime members.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game engages your entire mind and keeps you on your toes, searching for results and pieces to the puzzle.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This series was nt availble on my cable company so I bought it on inbox. Worked great, quality was very good
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Used to love this ap but hate today's upgrade which drops hourly data and goes for big graphics instead of lots of info. Am uninstalling.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book and in every chapter it has a suspense. I would give it 5 stars because of how much I loved it! After you finish one of the books you want to keep reading and keep reading until you can't read anymore! So thank you Suzanne Collins for giving us The Hunger Games series!
B00C061I3K|1.0|12 of 13 tracks are unlistenable crap.  Skip this and just get the single.  I have the album and if have skipped everything. Get Lucky is amazing.
B0067R0APK|5.0|The Platinum version(@ $2.99) is a Must have! More versatility than the Free version. It's like having a TV WeatherMan at your fingertips 24/7, and just as accurate as them too!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I enjoyed the book tremendously . It is fairly well written but the story and details make up for any writing problems.,I am going to read it again because I'm sure I can glen some more facts I may have missed the first time.
B008JFUQ16|5.0|In my opinion, I think this one is much more enjoyable than the first \\"Despicable Me\\" and also a great fun time at the movies. Those lovable minions won me over again. You should go see this movie!
0679805273|5.0|Great present for graduates. I purchased it along with the matching mug. She loved it.  Think it will be a staple grad present from now on.
B005D6O0LQ|5.0|Looks nice and fits just right. Ordered half size down as back is not adjustable and one foot slightly smaller then other. Price very reasonable.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is amazing!! I have it on my kindle and my phone and I play it all the time on both.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is great.  It's not too easy or too hard.  Can't wait for more apps.<br />I would recommend this game for everybody.
B006GHA9QQ|5.0|According to Wikipedia the Australian production was the best so far and new productions have slowed down so I purchased this DVD in lieu of waiting for a North American production. Amazing stage and costuming. Some good new music. I thought the editing they did to produce this DVD was really good. Great transitions between cameras, seemed like it was happening at the right time.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|worth seeing twice.<br />loved it when it first came out and the book is even better!<br />good for everyone. y
B006MHWXMS|5.0|I'm a big supporter of Google.  Tasks fell short, but this app really improves it.  The reminders is what really sells it for me.
B005ORVMT2|5.0|Well I was spectating a used Rush box set, instead I receive an almost new box set, with some little details on the outside of the box. But the inside of the box was in new conditions, with that smell that characterizes new prints. The delivery was very fast, it took just three days.<br />And about the music, Rush it's an amazing band I'm a long time fan. I had all their music in mp3, and I must say that this box containing the first 5 records plus a dvd (6 disc's) it quit a jewel. All records are remastered and sound very nice, there are a couple of tracks with some issues but nothing seriously.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Good for all ages!! Fun to get your mind thinking! I'd recommend to anyone who likes a riddle!<br /> Try it out.
B006AN78XS|1.0|Damned video did not download.  There is no easy way to get credit.  All I got was dots in a circle.  How about an easy way to credit the defective download. HELLLLLLLLLOOOOOO?  Amazon!  ANYONE HOME!
B00AB0Z88S|3.0|Too long for the type of story.  Did enjoy the special effects.  Surprise at end of movie.  Didn't expect it
B00C81LYH2|5.0|This Barbie Collector Holiday doll is all silver and elegance and snowflakes!  She's absolutely lovely, as to be expected from a Collector edition of Barbie.  I can't imagine there is any little girl out there, or adult collector that wouldn't adore this lovely doll.  Her dress is simple, her hair and accessories understated and all full of holiday sparkle.  I know that my little girl is going to be thrilled with this, and I'm sure your little one will be also.  I know that this doll is probably meant to be displayed, but I'm going to let my daughter decide for herself.  If she really wants to play with her, then so be it.  What good is a doll in a box if the child wants to touch her frilly dress, silky hair and play pretend?  No matter what you or your gift recipient decides to do with this doll, I know no one will be disappointed.
B00BGIBVP8|1.0|I'd have to rate this movie as one of the worst I've ever watched.  It has the characteristics of a slow motion train wreck; just when you think it can't get any worse, it does! It has a great cast but the storyline is so poor that there is nothing that the cast can do.  To top it off the movie is long.  Save yourself from a trip on the angst express. There are far better activities for your time.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|It was fun for a bit.  But became too predictable.  Last level was defective as I could not use the drill and bit on the X.  Had to look up the solution online.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|watching season one over and again prompted me to read the entire series. so glad ive read them all. bought for kindle fire and had no issues. the dictionary is a must have
B0067R0APK|5.0|Great improvement over the free version. A lot more weather info and a vivid radar map. Well worth the $2.99 upgrade price.
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|This book is great. it is funny sad and much more . Get this book it is not a wast of money it's great.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I really enjoy puzzle games, this one is one the best I have played in a long time. If you like puzzle games, you are sure to enjoy this one. Can't wait for the next ROOM!
1451696191|5.0|I teach teenagers, and because this book is consistently on the young adult best seller list, I felt it only right to give it a read.  After all, if I'm recommending books to my students, I need to have read them, right?<br /><br />The Perks of Being a Wallflower did not disappoint.  Both charming and brutal, Chbosky captures the essence of high school.  His protagonist, Charlie, conveys his story to us through a series of letters written to ... someone.  This first-person narrative device is especially appropriate because Charlie is wildly introverted.  Through his letters, we are able to ascertain his thoughts on the events unfolding around him.  We know him far better than anyone else in the novel, and that may be one reason behind his charisma.<br /><br />Chbosky has delivered the ultimate outsider, but that outsider wins over a select group of kids, and as Charlie is accepted, we understand that these other teenagers take Charlie as he is, idiosyncrasies and all, which makes us love them as he loves them.  If I may digress a bit, in Charlie, I think many of us see ourselves.  Whether one is currently a teen or an old man like me, Charlie reminds us of some aspect of ourselves, and as he experiences triumphs here and there, we are triumphant with him.  Of course, for most, the comparisons end there, as I will touch upon later.<br />The Perks of Being a Wallflower has been banned in many schools, and while I personally don't believe in banning books, I will admit that this book gets a tad graphic.  There is a lot of sex, a lot of drugs, and a lot of booze.  The language is harsh, and homosexuality is prevalent.  In other words, this book demands a certain level of maturity and perspective.  Would I be comfortable recommending this book to a middle school student?  Personally, I would not.  Honestly, I wouldn't even feel it appropriate for underclassman at the high school level.  That being said, juniors and seniors could definitely handle it, and I would have no problem putting the books in their hands.<br /><br />I won't reveal the ending of the book to you - to do such a thing would be criminal.  However, it caught me off guard, to be sure.  I had pretty much made up my mind about Charlie's aloofness.  When the true cause is revealed ... it shocked me.<br /><br />I'm glad I read The Perks of Being a Wallflower, and it certainly deserves all the attention it's garnered.  While I don't believe for a minute it should be banned, I do think it requires a certain amount of maturity that some students may not yet possess.  Well-written that cuts to one's emotional core, The Perks of Being a Wallflower is an engaging read that will linger in the reader's mind long after finishing it.<br /><br />~Scott William Foley, author of Souls Triumphantproblem putting the books in their hands.<br /><br />I won't reveal the ending of the book to you - to do such a thing would be criminal.

B008IJT0CE|5.0|This app is awesome. I suffer from insomnia and this app helps immensely. So many options to choose from depending on my mood.
B00000IMTE|5.0|I missed hearing those songs from the radio. A lot radio stations do not play those songs anymore these days.
B00AEFYCL4|5.0|Great movie, based on true events, but very sad. Good buy. 5 stars, dvd works great and enjoyed watching it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very enjoyable, challenging yet not frustrating. Look forward to similar challenging puzzle games that are fun to play without being so complicated you want to pull your hair out.
B004UJAOLM|3.0|The book was easy to read on my device. The language used was, at times, difficult to understand. I would recommend.
B00CKJ2KK2|1.0|It stinks it doesn't let you rejoin when you go to the menu when you stop playing to repair and it crashes it stinks
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This was a compelling story,well written, with a devastating ending. It is a tale that should be read by every parent of a teenager so that they begin to comprehend twitter, Facebook and email and their use and impact on their children's lives.
B005GY0Y8S|3.0|hooked enough to read the next one. does she like France or not? I have not made up my mind.
B00000IMTE|5.0|This album is a masterpiece, blending the heavier sounds of what Rainbow would prove to us to be with Dio, with the more groove laden rockers of Elf. If you love Dio, this is a must have. Highlt recommended for those that love 70's rock and early metal. These songs pump with energy and ooze emotion due to Ronnie's special quality and talent. What a legacy Dio has left us.
044022425X|5.0|Love this series.  Have read almost the entire series by Diana Gabaldon.  She is great.  I will pass this on to my daughter when I am finished.  Then order the next in the series.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|I had seen the movie and hesitated reading the book but glad I did! I ended up ready the entire trilogy! Very interesting characters and a real window into Swedish life, crime , institutions! Sandwiches & coffee, trains, summer cabins are things I didn't know about plus the maze of be autocracy and ministries that created a secret police force within a legitimate one. Very relevant to what's happening today in the Staes & other countries. A fast read, very intriguing! Lasting characters and moral issues.
B004478AS4|5.0|I rolled my eyes when I saw that this was my assigned book this term for my literature class; I will openly admit my apprehension was quite premature. I thought it was going to be a challenging rea read and fail to retain my attention but it was the complete opposite. So well written and I very much enjoyed reading it.  I read it in three sittings...I could not put it down.
0345529057|5.0|Arrived very quickly, well packed. Having seen the TV serials it was interesting to read the books upon which they were based. For fans of the genre a great read,
B00000IMTH|5.0|The first 3 albums by Rainbow are must have albums for any lover of great rock and metal. Every song from these early Rainbow albums should be on and best of. No track fails to drive you with it's rocking energy, or touch you with it deep wells of emotion. Rainbow at their best.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|To me this book was everything we know deep down inside ourselves but rarely get to think about. Once someone else talks about it it immediately makes sense to us. That is what this book felt like, and it was great. James Altucher isn't a genius, but he is down to earth and full of experience. A lot of us would be wise to take heed to his advise. I really enjoyed his thoughts because they made ME think, and some times our brain needs a nudge. Lets all get out of the rut and lead the lives that we CHOOSE to live!
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Sanderson does an excellent job creating alternative worlds and his creativity in this is very impressive.  Character development is well-paced and very thorough.  It took a little bit of reading for me to get fully hooked, but I did and am looking forward to the next piece in the series.  It's long, but didn't feel long.
1451673442|3.0|The Secret... Is to think positively. How many times have I heard that throughout my life?  It isn't a secret. It's a fact that like attracts like, so it is logical to assume thinking positive would somehow yield favorable results. However, it would be nice to know the secret of managing life so that it didn't get in the way of thinking positive.  It's a good read though, especially for those looking for life's answers. Can't drop anchor here though, the search continues.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|James Cameron has advanced the area of special effects to a new high. This is a beautifully made movie with a dark and sad undertone. This would be a good family film except for the objectionable language. Beside the language, this is a really good film.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I'm here to review this app... obviously...this is a great app that challenges the different parts of the mind. This app is definatley worth getting and best of all its FREE!! don't we all love that? by the way this isnt another 100 floors, but if you like that youre gunna love this I couldn't stop playing this app...they promise more levels so don't delete it once you finish...there will be more brain puzzling puzzles on the way. get this app. you wont regret it.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|It was broken and I can't get my printer to work so therefore I am out 50.00 dollars.. Won't happen again.

B003ODIZL6|5.0|This dictionary comes in handy when your writing a paper about anything out of you just want something to read.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this a great game that is well made.great fun for all. and the very best part about it is that it is free!
1781162646|4.0|It was a fun and easy read.  Stephen King usually delivers, although until the end, never sure what will be delivered.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Great for kids. My grandson loves it!!! He plays it constantly. Really  keeps his attention and occupies him while we're driving.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I like the interview style of this book. When describing the encounters with the zombies, the story went fast. The descriptions of the survivors facing and fighting off the zombies was pretty cool. Then the post World War Z happened, the descriptions of zombies kind of trailed off. Overall this book was pretty neat for any fans of tHe zombie genre because there is a lot of it! I'm looking forward to see how the movie turned out. Hopefully there is more action in the movie than there was in the book. If there was more action descriptions from the narrations then this book would of gotten the full 5 stars.
B00992CF6W|5.0|?I can't get on realms and it make me angry  I want join someone unless I update but I don't know.
1847879071|4.0|A good read and really helped with school assignments. Very clear and easy to understand. Would buy again. buy it if u need help with SPSS
B00CWY76CC|4.0|this game is a lot of fun! I would recommend to anyone who likes solving puzzles. it really makes you think!
B000FCKGPC|3.0|Not my favorite of the series so. But it gives you some new characters to look forward to. Unfortunately you are kept in suspense of a lot of characters for an entire book until you get to book 5. In spite of that I still enjoyed the story and developments and can't wait to start the next one.
1616550414|5.0|I bought it for a friend who is in love with the series and he was amazed.<br />It's the definitive book, including story and art from all the games and a bonus manga at the end
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love this app. this is my favorite horse app. it lets you have one on one action with the horse you own! although I rated it 4 stars because you don't get to choose a horse that you want to start with.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|....because you won't be able to put it down!<br /><br />This is by far the most amusing, addictive game I've seen yet for the Kindle Fire. The graphics are good, the game play is simple and absorbing. I can't speak to the sound effects, we have to keep the sound off where I work, so I've never heard it.<br /><br />Hill Climb Racing gets my \\"Flat Battery Five Star\\" rating. I will certainly check out any app by this developer, simply because this one is so well crafted.
B002SJKWZ4|5.0|I purchased this as a gift. They were really happy with it. Its so awesome I want one for myself. I don't know if I didn't read the description well enough (I probably didn't) but I thought the wand came with buttons to push  but apparently you have to program the command to a particular hand motion. Makes it way cooler in my book.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|This is a wonderful book series an  I would recommend it for everyone who loves a romantic story!! Can't wait to see what happens in book 3!
B00AB7HESI|5.0|This game is so cool for multiple reasons.1.you canwrite pretty much anything and make it better with adjectives make for example a bear to an angry armed bear. Some cool ones are nouns:death wormhole apocalypse darkmagic gorilla(you can stack gorillas)and adjectives:radioactive temporarilyexploding and some cheats are making a medusa head,petrifying a shoggoth and keep shooting it and you can try making a &quot;super mega fast jetpack&quot; and a bathtub will appear
B00BPA7U34|2.0|Just a couple songs; very Frank Sinatra like. He has a pleasant voice but I was disappointed in the number of songs on the disc/
B00AREIAI8|4.0|love this game it is so much fun. it is very easy to catch on to and you can have more than one horse.
B00452VF4O|3.0|took me an inordinately long time to get through this book.  Not a book that i couldn't put down...sometimes for months.  Not as satisfying as Here Be Dragons, for me.  I would read more of this author's books, though.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|First game of this type and find it very enjoyable.  Each level has a new twist.  I would recommend this for any one.
B005723JSQ|5.0|This book was awesome!  The character development and story progression made for a great read.  Looking forward to reading other books by this author.<br /><br />One negative..... I read this book on a first generation Kindle.  The jumping back and forth of footnotes was tedious.  The footnotes were a cool part of the story but it does not come across well on the electronic device. They put the footnotes at the end of every chapter.  Once you finish the chapter you have to click through the footnotes again.  It would have been better to put them at the end of the book instead of at the end of each chapter.  I don't know how it would look on one of the newer electronic devices.  I looked at the book today at one of my local retail stores.  All of the footnotes are at the bottom of each page where it is referenced.  I think this author is a talented enough author that in the future we will see her \\"extra thoughts\\" incorporated into her writing instead of as footnotes.
B007MDB71O|5.0|I will say this. I read these books many a decade ago. I found the stories they told to be very inspiring! I was not dissappointed by the film version. There are many more stories to tell......
B001HBYH9Q|4.0|Okay, it's a fluffy romcom and suffers from the excessive sugar common to its genre.  But, hey, throw in Hugh Grant's irrepressible charm and the support of a good British supporting cast and a decent script and it's not a bad way to spend a couple of hours.  Oh, and Julia Roberts could be worse.
034580709X|5.0|Those of us in the United States who have waited patiently for THE BAT, the first volume in Jo Nesbø's Harry Hole series, need no longer hold our collective breath. It's finally here, thanks in great part to the careful translation by Don Bartlett, and well worth the wait. This debut novel demonstrates that Nesbø, whose series has been throwing curves at readers ever since the books started appearing somewhat out of chronological order a few years ago, has been doing so from its inception.<br /><br />Just for starters, the entirety of THE BAT takes place not in Oslo or even elsewhere in Scandinavia, but in Sydney, Australia. Harry has been dispatched from his Oslo digs to assist in the investigation of the murder of Inger Holter, a young Norwegian woman who was a minor celebrity in her native country. Holter had moved to Sydney for romantic reasons several months previously and decided to stay, never imagining that she would meet her end there by being raped and murdered. Harry is informed by Sydney's chief of detectives in precise and no uncertain terms that his role in the investigation is that of an observer and nothing more. A babysitter is assigned to Harry in the form of Andrew Kensington, the sole Aboriginal on the force. Harry takes an immediate liking to the charming man, who takes him on a tour of the highs and lows of Sydney, while the teetotaling Harry behaves himself --- for a while, anyway.<br /><br />And yes, it is a very sober and well-behaved Harry who we meet in the opening pages of THE BAT, so much so that we wonder if perhaps we have wandered off the page and into another book. Yet this is still our Harry Hole, and soon enough the backstory that created the Harry we all know and love is revealed. As far as him maintaining the role of a silent observer, well, that simply isn't going to happen.<br /><br />Holter is the latest unfortunate victim in a string of similar murders that traverse the Australian continent and go back in time for years. Just when the Sydney police force and Harry believe that they may have discovered the killer's identity, an unexpected tragedy sends Harry careening off the wagon. The only good to come out of that occurrence is that, as an indirect result, Harry discovers a clue indicating that the culprit is still very much at large. There is no shortage of suspects, but when a clever trap to catch the fiend goes awry, Harry is willing to sacrifice everything to bring the killer to justice in any way he can, no matter what it may cost him.<br /><br />THE BAT is of more than mere historical importance for both longtime Nesbø fans and newcomers. It stands on its own quite well as a police procedural, while at the same time demonstrating Nesbø's penchant for taking chances in new and unexpected directions. Additionally, the book serves as a bit of a guidebook to Australia, with attention given to the seamier side of Sydney (what else might one expect?), as well as folklore, folktales and cultural aspects thrown in. There is quite a feast here, and while Nesbø occasionally wanders off the heart of the matter to describe the local flora and fauna, not a bit of it is boring. THE BAT is a must-have addition to your summer reading list.<br /><br />Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub

1476719071|2.0|It was ok, too many plot cliches and Travis is a bit of a creepy Heathcliff violent weirdo forcing people people what to do and bullying them. Also, a lot of girl on girl hate.    Every girl is a $kank or $lut with a few exemptions. And if you sleep with Travis - beware you will be labelled a $lut with STIs... what this says about Travis is...that apparently he's a stud and without blemish.    Also, he calls her pigeon...hhhmmmm....    Not a bad book- but it shouldn't be YA/NA hence this will be rated 2*. Far too adult with terrible themes. But I loved his family.    .......................    There are appears to be many discussions with regards to the inappropriate themes e.g. irresponsible drinking, Bullying and sexist and Misogynistic language in YA books.    BD appears to suffer all of these issues within it.    The concern is that books these are geared for young adults. Below are interesting POV with regards to this - just wondered what anyone else thought?    \\"this is a post about how and why words matter a whole heck of a lot, especially in YA lit, when we know that they are being consumed by readers whose identities and views about the world are in the process of forming. I don't say this in an attempt to leverage any kind of hand-wringing save-the-children defense! Rather, I say it because YA lit is essentially about identity-formation and, therefore, any of us who read it go through similar identity-formations.\\"    [...]    \\"What we are heartily sick of, however, are feeble and inept teenage-girl main characters, whose lives come into focus only through the addition of some melodramatic attraction to a charismatic male figure who seems to carry all the personality in the relationship.\\"    [...]  edit   delete   flag *

I didn't even realize until I went to write this review that the main character is never named.
B00457WZEI|5.0|Very touching story.  I enjoyed it.  It reminded me of Black beauty I read many years ago.  It's so nice to find books that are not &#34;R&#34;rated
B0091REZMW|4.0|THIS IS ONE GAME THAT IS VERY INTERESTING RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING FOR ME. THE TIME FLIES BY BEFORE I KNOW IT I EVEN GOT THE GAME FOR MY LAPTOP. THE ONLY THING I DON'T LIKE IS THAT YOU HAVE TO PURCHASE EITHER COINS OR DIAMONDS EVENTUALLY TO GET ON IN THE GAME. IT IS A HUNT AND SEEK GAME IN DAYLIGHT OR NIGHT WITH PICTURES OR WORDS BUT LOTS OF FUN.
B007HACDLK|5.0|So many of the current crop of spy thrillers have the main character doing super human feats that leave no room for him/her to seem \\"normal.\\"  This doesn't happen with Mitch Rapp.  Despite being injured (no spoiler) he does what he needs to do while working with his injuries, not in spite of them.  Even the bureaucrats in this book are believable...not overly self-righteous but individuals who might indeed be your neighbor.  The plot is great, the location scary and the characters believable.  All-in-all the perfect thriller and great beach book.
159463176X|5.0|Familial bonds continue to be the theme in Hosseini's latest book, And The Mountains Echoed. The main story is of brother, Abdullah and sister, Pari.<br /><br />In addition to the main story of Abdullah and Pari, there are several other storylines that beautifully and easily interweave, and take the reader from Afghanistan to the United States, Greece and Paris.<br /><br />It's so beautifully written that by page 5 I didn't want it to end. \\"But Madaline was one of those people to whom elegance came effortlessly as though it were a genetic skill,...\\" This is one example of many of Hosseini's ability to allow the reader to really see and understand a character.<br /><br />I highly recommend. It's great storytelling with great characters and great writing.

B000VMIILU|1.0|We were totally disappointed by this movie.  We hoped to see a lot of life aboard a sailing ship, and ships sailing, not political intrigue and close ups of people being gruesomely killed.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Very fun and challenging game. Can get frustrating at times when you can't seem to find where that last clue is but always rewarding when you finally solve the puzzle. Only wish there was a help or hint feature.

B005LAIH2W|5.0|Awesome movie. True to the book and the spirit of the Burroughs tales. Really needs a sequel. I think Disney intentionally tanked this movie to offset the massive profits from Avengers. Tax write-off. Some say this movie wasn't that original, yet the source material for this movie is older than any source material you may compare it to.  It predates Star Trek/Star Wars and any other clones. Give it a chance. It's great.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Great read, great suspense, great action, and possibly some heart and romance. I'll be interested to see where it all goes...
B00BTV62KG|4.0|I love Sco and saw him in Vancouver, BC the day before this album was released.  He played several of the songs from the record, including Dub Dub and Endless Summer.  Sco was in classic form and was fun to listen to, as always.<br /><br />IMHO, however, the complexity of the songs in Deux is a bit off when compared to some of my favorites from Uberjam and Up All Night.  The live versions of the Deux tunes lend themselves to more interesting solos (and longer ones) that allowed Sco to present the real mood of the song.  Some of them just don't come through on the album, though, either b/c the timing is too short or b/c it was recorded in a studio.  For example, in the live show, Dub Dub started off a pretty dull and I was preparing myself for a long boring Reggae song.  But it grew into a really exceptional, energetic finish.  The album hasn't been able to do that for me on Dub Dub, though, it just kind of plods along at the same old Reggae pace....for....ever...and...ever...<br /><br />Also, the first two Uberjam albums seemed to stretch the limits on what a jam band could do, musically speaking.  This album seems to take a different approach by combining other genres into the mix, like Reggae and Boogie, as if John is saying \\"you can use anything to jam on, not just Rock.\\"  You'll have to decide for yourself if you like the end result.  I enjoyed it on many of the tracks.<br /><br />(And yes, I realize the first two projects had genre fusion - I Brake 4 Monster Booty being a prime example.  This album seemed to have more fusion attempts than the last ones, though).<br /><br />But even with my criticism, the album will hold a place on my mp3 player for a long time.  I love Sco's music, and this album, as many of his other do, has some great music.
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|I enjoyed playing the game and my grandkids enjoyed it on a flight between KC and Orlando.  I would recommend it.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Unlike the movie by the same name, the book &#34;World War Z&#34; provides a fascinating look back on a world which has survived a zombie apocalypse. Told though interviews, we see the whole ordeal from early, isolated accounts of strange behavior to the aftermath of the war and the totally new world survivors find themselves in. I would highly recommend it not only to zombie buffs, but fans of alternate history and other speculative fiction as well.

0307887448|4.0|Much as (positive) reviewers are wont to describe this novel as manna for 80s pop culture junkies, I disagree.  Though Ready Player One is chock full of 80s references, they have all the literary force of just that: references.  This novel conjures the feel of the decade to which it pays loving homage in only the most superficial of ways.  And much as (positive) reviewers are wont to describe this novel as manna for computer gaming junkies, I'll have to defer.  I'm not a gamer myself, and found the long gaming descriptions in this novel somewhat tiresome.  Hence, a partial star docking.  The rest of my docked star is on account of this novel's many pat story elements, the generally weak character development throughout, and an at times rather plodding first-person narrative perspective.<br /><br />Criticisms aside, however, Ready Player One is an exceptionally imaginative novel.  Cline does a brilliant job of hinting at the picture of a none-too-distant future society crumbling under the pressures of resource scarcity, and of describing in painstaking detail the virtual world into which people of that society retreat and the manifold and complex ways they enact their lives in it.  Ready Player One is one of the most rigorously thought out pieces of speculative fiction I've ever encountered.  My one-star deduction is on account of assorted literary quibbles I had with this book, but these quibbles pale in comparison to the very great satisfaction I experienced immersing myself in Cline's lavishly envisioned world.  Ready Player One is a terrific book!

B0086700CM|4.0|I enjoyed this game more than a lot of games on the android. The most annoying thing was that when I received any notification on my phone, it would cause the game to be unresponsive and the character would run into an obstacle.
B0046B3QTG|4.0|I thought this movie was quite funny. I love the little minions, they are so adorable and hilarious. The music is also great.
0930289234|5.0|For starters, the artwork is wonderful, not too inky and fully of life page after page. The story slowly builds so that by the end you're not only emotionally invested in each character but also understand the overarching storylines inevitability. Not all happiness and rainbows, just the right amount of darkness and light.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a fun little game! Right now it is far too short for a five star rating - only ten levels - but hopefully more will be coming. Clever concept; find hidden objects and solve puzzles to open the door... really makes you think!
B000022TSY|5.0|Good quality of one of the best biker movies out there! It doesn't get much better than Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper cruising across the country on rigid frame panheads, smokin dope, and partying down. Perhaps my favorite part of this dvd is the bonus features which explain how the movie was made, which is a must watch. I would buy this again in a heartbeat.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|This movie does a great job at telling a story full of action and adventure. It capitalizes on children's love of exploration, and looking back with rose-colored glasses, I'm still able to enjoy this movie as much now as I did the day it came out in theaters.
0060512806|5.0|I will start by saying, this book is lengthy, the paperback clocks in at over 1,000 pages, however that being said, I couldn't wait to find out what was going to happen next, and I was anxious thinking about what was happening in the other storylines while I was reading. Totally immersive, not a world of trolls and wizards or magic, but I was filled with a sense of awe for the world (our world!). Each character was well developed and interesting, each storyline as riveting as the last and the way they are woven together doesn't slap you in the face so much as creep up on you and spook you. A fun and riveting read.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Uniquely makes you think where things might be, and how they relate to solving the problems.  Each level seems to get a little harder to guess. A real brain exerciser.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|I downloaded this game because I saw a friend was playing it. It worked fine and everything, I personally just didn't think it was the greatest thing.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|If you love the shows then you can't go without reading the books, they are more graphic and have a much deeper story.  It is hard sometimes to keep characters and stories straight because it's not condensed down like the show, but still a great series.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I don't tend to read a lot of current fiction and certainly not a lot of books on the bestseller lists. I tend to stick to non-fiction and classics.  However, after reading multiple good reviews on this book and liking the genre, I thought I would give it a try.  This book is not bad but it's not as great as everyone has made it out to be.  I thought it was predictable. About 75 pages in, I had pretty much guessed the major plot twists. I figured it only could go one of two ways and people were so hyped up about the book that it had to go one way in particular.  I also found it hard to read at times because the two main characters are so unlikeable. Some nights I would just have to put it down because I'd had enough of these wretched people.  There is no real hero or protagonist to root for in this story, which makes it hard to sympathize with anyone.  I did think the style of writing, being told from two different voices, was interesting, but again because I didn't like the two leads, I didn't care for being inside either of their heads.  I see that the movie rights have been bought for this book which I expected because it has been so popular. Perhaps I'd be willing to check out the movie depending on the casting because you'd really have to cast actors who can pull off playing really despicable people.

DEFENDING JACOB was a provocative read, even if the reader does not come away with a feeling of complete resolution. I still find myself wondering about possible answers.

B00BCK1A5G|5.0|Excellent story - thoroughly loved it - better read the second time round - little things missed in first reading - cant wait to find out what happens next
B008BU75IQ|5.0|From the first to the last page totally engrossing.  The characters are well described and really come to life.  Can't wait for the next installment.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It's challenging enough to make you think but not so challenging you don't want to play which makes it fun

B005S9EKCW|5.0|My husband and I loved the movie version, obviously.... enough to invest in the DVD.  We have watched it two times since we bought it 2 months ago!
B0084U0IEG|4.0|I enjoyed reading this light account of spies in 1970's London. Not a profound meditation on the morality of undercover ops, but still a page-turner.
B002DR3WG2|2.0|this book while being a classic is difficult to read and get into the cadence ; book has no overwhelming traits and was rather boring with very little substance to it
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Exactly how it was on my old tablet.  Easy to use and set up.  Glad that this app was available.
B00BJS7LHC|4.0|If you are a Tarantino fan you will love it.  I enjoyed it thoroughly and have since watched it again several times.  If I have company and we are looking for something to watch if said company has not seen this movie I will generally jump on it.  The acting is top notch and the story is very well thought through and executed.  Two academy awards it must have had something good in it right?<br /><br />For the people who go to the extremes when talking about this movie please don't get too serious.  You'll end up having a heart attack.  Take it for what it is and either enjoy it or don't.<br /><br />If you are a fan of good movies and not totally hung up on racism, violence or other stupid issues then you will enjoy it.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Pretty fun. Controls are simple. It does get kind of hard around level twenty or so even  getting perfect scores on every level.
B008JFUNYG|5.0|Now I must say, and this might give me less credibility, I have never seen the original. However... I am a horror movie lover and watch them almost daily with my husband. We watched this last night and it was the first time in my entire life I ACTUALLY needed to hang on to him while we sat on the couch together. My heart was racing the entire film from the moment of the first suspense scene and after it was over I seriously felt like I'd been on a rollercoaster from the weird adrenaline I was feeling. I can't say it enough, this is one incredibly scary movie in a world of very non scary horror movies, be prepared for smething incredible!

0345803485|1.0|Triple crap! I should've listened to all the 1-2 star reviews. My inner goddess and I are feeling fifty shades dummer for buying this awful mess. How is this supposed to be a romance novel? It's more like a bad script for a twisted porno and should be labeled as such! Christian Grey is a creepy pervertive stalker who lures this young inexperienced woman into his sick pervertive world. She naively agrees to some relationship with him because he's handsome, a billionaire and let's face it, he doesn't really give her much of a chance to say no. Each time she hints on distancing herself, he's at her doorsteps literally forcing his way into her bedroom. He's extemely possessive (not in a romantic cute way but in a creepy suffocating way). He is easily upset by almost everything she does including not telling him right away about planning to visit her mom in Georgia and makes all these threats to punish her. Halfway through the book, this girl is actually afraid to roll her eyes at him because he actually hit her the last time she did. What the hell!!! This story is about a girl who lands herself in an abusive relationship and it's being celebrated as a romance novel? I felt so sick and disgusted after reading halfway through this book, I just had to stop. What next... Fifty Shades of Blue (from battery and assault)?? This book is definitely going straight to the trash and will definitely not be watching the movie if they ever decide to waste money into making one.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|Ok, all I can say is awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!  Kept me on the edge wondering what was going to happen next. If you enjoy reading any of James' books, you will love this one.  The ending was a nice twist on everything.  Left me wondering which time was correct.
B004UXUX4Q|5.0|Hi Again<br /><br />This is another example of a well written movie.  When is Hollywood going to learn that you have to have a Good script before you start a movie.  The Descendants has a great cast but it all starts with the Script.<br /><br />Doug Dillenberger

B00CAJMGDI|5.0|Lindsey Stirling is a very talented person.  Some people have said how they think her music is just more dubstep for young people to waster money on, or that all her songs are the same.  I dislike most dubstep stuff, but Lindsey's use of the violin changes the music.  Also, the songs do sound similar only because they are all in the same style.  They each have their own unique beat to them.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|One of the best movies to come out in a while.  I would recommend this movie to anyone.  End of story.

0061452068|5.0|I'm not going to add to the much more complete reviews here with detailed analyses, but present a short summary of my own reactions (after listening to the book on Audible).<br /><br />Rarely does someone tackle such a highly fragmented, emotional topic as whether our society is driving itself to doom or to prosperity, and Ridley has cut through the haze with magnificent clarity.  Ridley argues that our species' nature is to improve its lot through the increasingly cooperative efforts of people through trade and specialization, and the political and economic systems that encourage cooperation and specialization have shown time and again the greatest moves forward in quality of life for its people.  Ridley shows through detailed data and a balanced interpretation that this progression is strong and vibrant today, more than at any time in human history, and likely to continue its upward arc as long as governments do not interfere.  Today the outlook is positive, with more systems moving to freer trade involving the contributions of more and more people.<br /><br />I found this to be one of the dozen or so books I have read (listened to) that shape my own outlook and philosophy far more than most.  To me the biggest value is the depth and breadth of the references Ridley has assembled, and the cohesive nature of his arguments.  While there are certain to be quibbles and we may find over time that some outright wrong ideas are in the book, to me the overall argument is solidly supported.  The fact that almost all the arguments are contrary to popular opinion is not surprising; rarely have widely held public opinions, and even sometimes widely held scientific consensus, been correct.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|awesome. makes it so easy to pass the time. the games are fun yet challenging and anyone can play. I definitely recommend
B002UEW31I|4.0|Some parts of the movie are hard to watch but all the actors did a great job. I like that the foreign languages were kept in place.

B007MDB71O|4.0|I went into this movie hoping that it would follow the books. These were some of the first novels I read as a young man and they sparked a life long love of reading. Although they were a mixture of the first and second books the movie was very entertaining! Very enjoyable!
B005HJU7HA|4.0|wasn't sure I'd care for it, but have been doing some research on the variations of Sherlock Holmes stories.  This book proved to be entertaining. written in the voice of Dr. Watson, you get the full back story on how the two met, and the various adventures.  Every now and again a story seems to be a repetition/variation of an earlier one, but it's still quite fun to read them all
B005DD7H50|4.0|I could watch this movie over and over again!  The unexpected twist and turns keep you captivated.  I definitely was not disappointed.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|This one was just as interesting and exciting as the first. Looking forward to the next one. Loving Grey/Steele relationship!!
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Very disappointed in Sylvia Day. The first half of the book was not worth reading.  It just reiterated the passion and madening sex between Gideon and Eva.  The second half took us to the next phase of their relationship which should have been the entire book.  The ending was a cliff-hanger.  Though it felt like the author just decided to stop writing and then signed off with see you next time.  If you can, borrow the book before wasting your money.  Sylvia Day clearly rushed when writing Entwined with You.
B008M87GJK|4.0|well deserving of it's great rep for getting GLOBAL news to you.  in-depth, well-researched reporting you can trust regarding world events

B00C4YZ12C|5.0|Whether you have fun memories of space invaders, asteroids &amp; others, or you are new to this genre, you are going to love this game! highly addictive, and just plain fun. I have been gaming since Pong, &amp; this is one of the best &quot;quick play&quot; games I've seen.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|This season was great. Love the humor. The writing is smart and the stories moves right along. Keep it going!
B000LAZDQA|4.0|The notion of legitimate actors engaging in explicit on-screen sex as part of story and character isn't quite as new as it seems.  Frank Ripploh, for example, shocked the hell out of audiences in 1980 when he did exactly that in the German art-house favorite TAXI ZUM KLO.  Even so, thirty years later it isn't exactly the norm, so I came to SHORTBUS with considerably curiosity ... and discovered the movie wasn't what I expected it to be at all.<br /><br />In some respects, SHORTBUS is what you might expect if Robert Altman directed such a film--it has a very mosaic-like quality and an open-ended conclusion.  Even so, there is a central plot.  Sofia (Sook-Yin Lee) is a sex-therapist who has been faking orgasms with her husband all these years.  Indeed, she's never had one at all.  Her frustrations explode when she is visited by two gay men, James and Jamie (Paul Dawson and PJ DeBoy), who are debating whether or not to have an open relationship; in frustration with Jamie's superficial attitudes she slaps him and then must explain herself.  When she does so, they invite her join her at Shortbus, a sort of salon where members do everything from drugs to performance art to sex.<br /><br />At this point the story takes off in two different directions, one focused on Sofia as she goes in search of an orgasm and one focused on the secretly suicidal James as he works to find a replacement for himself to live with Jamie after he is dead.  Sofia meets and becomes involved with a dominatrix named Severin (Lindsay Beamish); James and Jamie become involved first with Ceth (Jay Brennan) and then later with Caleb (Peter Stickles.)  Along the way the various characters admit to a series of personal issues ranging from past abuse to depression to inadequacy.  One way or another, all of them struggle to feel they belong, and that struggle generally involves sex.  And make no mistake, SHORTBUS is crammed with explicit sex, including penetration, oral sex, and ejaculation.<br /><br />If this sounds dark, it isn't.  If anything, SHORTBUS is a fairytale painted in attractive, glossy colors, and although it has any number of touching moments, it is actually very, very funny.  But my criticism of the film is that it is too attractive, too glossy, too touching, too funny.  There's not much in the way of genuine grit or even any degree of reality, and the story and characters give up all their secrets in a single viewing.  Enjoyable for what it is, but in truth it is very slight.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewerthis sounds dark, it isn't.

B000000HSU|2.0|The remix on this album is terrible. I heard this back in the mid 80s on vinyl and all I can say is that THAT is the way this album should be heard. The remix totally removes the balls and the nuance from this record. It's sterile. It's like watching Lucas' revised Star Wars. Don't buy this crap. Bookmark the YouTube videos where people have posted the full album in the old mix format and listen to that instead.<br /><br />The material on this record changed music. Why anybody would tamper with perfection is beyond me.
B002LFPAUC|5.0|Saw this series in the UK over a decade ago and finally was able to purchase it. Brought back great memories. This video is perfect for those who love British humor!
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|It was great to see how all started. The first episode showed in a weird color and the picture was a little warped.
B001UGB1X8|4.0|enjoyed, good Tommy Lee Jones movie. If yo ulike detective stories, this is a good one. I like to see John Goodman get beat-up.
0307279189|5.0|Great storytelling. Inspirational characters. Fascinating science. Also a wake-up call for an increasingly sedentary society. Exercise IS medicine and running is its purist form.
B001NA6096|5.0|Romantic almost to a fault, the beginning of Jesse and Celine's tale commences when they are in their early twenties and have all the hope and time in the world.

B00B935SUY|5.0|This documentary is everything a movie like this should be.  Flawless.  Takes you in and doesn't let you out until the closing credits.  Learned so much, full of grit and music of the soul.
B001N9ESQ4|5.0|The follow-up to &#34;Before Sunrise&#34; finds Jesse and Celine meeting again, this time in Paris--older, slightly wiser, with the weight of a decade apart on their shoulders as they walk and talk for an hour-plus of screen time.
B008YI91HS|2.0|It was too fake in the invention of the dinosaur species by the old scientist. And when they went to the park it was not realistic by the way the actors responded to the actions of the animals.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I absolutely love this video! Before this, I used to play tennis or go on the elliptical to \\"work out,\\" but since I didn't do those on a daily basis, they just weren't enough to build muscle. After reading the reviews, I decided to buy this DVD along with 8lb hand weights. After huffing and puffing and barely crawling through the first level 1 workout, I knew I had to move down to 5lb weights. I'm 20-years-old and fairly fit, but MAN, this workout is HARD! HOWEVER, not stupidly hard enough to do everyday for a little under 30 minutes.<br /><br />I got my 6' tall, 170 lb gym-rat boyfriend to workout with me one day 'cause he couldn't believe that the workout was that hard. He checked out my weights and told me the 3lb weights fit me a lot better. Afterwards, he was certainly sweating and took back what he said about my workouts being easy. He agreed it was a great cardio workout (but said he needed much heavier weights than 5 lb to build muscle... whatever!).<br /><br />Some recommendations to make your workout more effective --<br />1. Get the right weight dumbbells. Go to the store and lift a weight to the side of your body, your arm straight out, and see if you can hold it for 10 seconds.<br />2. Push ups are hard. Try searching on Google how to get better at push ups. Start at the wall, on a table, or a low couch. Whatever you're most comfortable doing during the workout.<br />3. Get heavier weights for chest presses! They're super easy and you don't get too much out of them if you don't pump up the weights.<br /><br />If you're still wondering if you should get this, GET IT! If you stopped and if you're wondering if you should continue with this workout, KEEP GOING! I've been at this for a while now, and my clothes look a lot better on me now! Good luck to everyone!
B005DJREGQ|4.0|I am too old to watch this and yet I could not turn it off. Episode after episode I ate them up like popcorn. I now feel closer to my HIgh School self and scared in anticipation of when my two sons go to high school!
1591845556|3.0|I purchased this book as a means to improve my speed in gaining new skills, not necessarily with the belief that I could gain those skills in 20 hrs. While I haven't tested any of the discussed methods, they seem very practical, e.g., focusing on one skill at a time; breaking down desired skill into sub-sets; creating fast feedback to inform practice. The problem came in when the author went into his examples -- using yoga, programming, typing, etc as a springboard. We're forced to live every moment with the author as he acquired those disciplines, including installation of various Ruby programs to his Mac -- and, the yoga example read more like a history of yoga, which would be okay if it was a long article about yoga history. This step-by-step, detailed information is out of focus with the methods learned in the beginning of the book. With that said, the book is still worth reading because it will aid in organizing your though process.
B00CKJ2KK2|2.0|Probably fine for those looking for this type of game, I was looking for a more simple game to play on the Kindle while in the air ports, etc a time killer.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Keeps you wondering what's next. You think you have it figured out and then there is another layer to the puzzle.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This was a very enjoyable game. Like a number of other reviewers, I wish it had been longer. The world was beautifully rendered and the puzzles were engaging. It played very well on my Kindle Fire, no glitches. More than worth the price. I hope there will be a sequel.

B009MYAQK4|3.0|It was just okay. I expected something a little more substantial. It was an easy read; no earth shattering insights.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Not too hard but still challenging and when too challenging plenty of other people smarter then me to help figure it out.
0399162097|3.0|It's not that I didn't like this book or felt that my time spent reading it was wasted. It's just that the parts of the book I was bored by and found pointless made the good parts less enticing and enjoyable.<br /><br />Rosemary tells the story of her family: mom, dad, older brother Lowell, and sister, Fern. Fern is a chimp, part of the family yet also part of a continual study that seeks to explore the relationship between chimp and human. Fern has a special bond with Rosemary, but at 5 years old, Rosemary is too young to realize and appreciate what that bond might mean. Then Fern leaves the family, and Rosemary doesn't realize until she's grown how much alike she and Fern are.<br /><br />What I liked about the book: Anecdotes and memories Rosemary shares about what life was like with Fern; what Rosemary learns about animal experimentation, her family, and herself (it was compelling when Rosemary faces the truth of her jealousy, her role in what happens to Fern, and her questionable memory); and those little gems that make you think (\\"I still haven't found that place where I can be my true self. But maybe you never get to be your true self, either.\\") I also liked the ending - you can see growth in Rosemary, her mother, and the situation with Fern.<br /><br />What I didn't like about the book: Rosemary's odd behavior (NOT the \\"monkey girl\\" actions she worries over, either - I wasn't particularly disturbed by her reaching out to touch some girl's braid, even if it was in the middle of class, and even without the girl's permission). Rosemary repeatedly states how she dislikes Harlow, a girl she meets in a very bizarre way at school and who she spends time in jail with. Yet Rosemary continues to hang out with Harlow, which I might have found quirky but OK - but all of a sudden Rosemary is popping mystery pills Harlow hands out like candy and drinking to excess - and the details of all this I found to be both boring and pointless.
B000FTWB7G|5.0|I love this cd the music on it kick ass and is worth the money you should listen to this cd
B007N8RULO|5.0|Good way to send some time and rack your brain in the process. Lot of fun and concentration<br /><br />. Thanks for making it free.
193700788X|1.0|It is not who she did or didn't end up with, it is the completely unbelievable way she brought it about. You don't build up one character most of the series and then dump him in the final. Even that I can accept, but you don't take a character that at best could be seen as a friend/big brother/mentor and in the last few hundred pages make him the love of her life.  That is just my chief complaint. This book is a hodgepodge of old characters and new ideas that just does not work. The series would have been better if this book had never been written and the series never been completed.<br /><br />Normally I would finish the newest book and go back an reread the earlier books. Not this time. This book has ruined the entire series for me. I might as well delete the entire series off my IPad.

B008UCJ7KO|1.0|what kind of ending was that?! so disappointed in the author and this book. it was a poor attempt at imitating fifty shades of grey with excessive sex (that didnt even flow right) and a non-descript villain. i want my money back.

B0050DIWFC|5.0|If you're looking for a fun easy read this is the perfect book for you.  It will keep you on your toes and wanting more and more.  Quick read, good book.
B00BLGXL3U|2.0|I didn't like it. Very well acted but not my thing. Most people did like it I heard. Try it and see
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I just can't figure out how to update subway surfers it is not very clear what to do. does anyone know how?
B00BHMETKC|4.0|A plot-driven movie that was what we've come to expect of Affleck the director...tight and well-paced without becoming a polemic
B007IXWL2C|5.0|If you read the first two books you will love this book just as much, if not more.  The first is my favorite, but its an easy fun read.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|James Rollins created yet another thrill packed novel that blends science and historical facts into scary, all too believable fiction.  Sigma is back with quite a few bangs and I couldn't be happier.  I also love that Mr. Rollins includes in all his books a &#34;fact or fiction&#34; section at the end with more information and future reading for those of us who want more once we're done with the book. I highly recommend to anyone who enjoys reading their thrillers with a lot of action and loads of science and history.
B00C061HZY|5.0|I am really enjoying this album, amazing quality and good price. This is one of my top albums in last times.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Really enjoyed the challenges. The rooms were more difficult as the levels progressed.  I would recommend this game to anyone who can not deny intrigue.
B0078XGEK2|5.0|This is a great book!  really goes into the psychology of love and passion.  highly recommended.  As always, amazon does a great job with shipping promptly.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love games like this. this is challenging yet not to the point where you cant complete a level. I cant wait for more levels!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I \\"would have to say this bingo is by far the best one out there. It never gets old. And there always adding new levels.

B00992CF6W|5.0|EPIC GAME!!!!! But pe has not as much as pc editon, or xbox 306 editon, But i think its awesome!!!!!! But the end and the REAL nethers is missing D: And NOTE: Realms is only alpha (in game it says beta) so its not the best, i never got to be on a realms server before though. BUY IT, BUY IT!!! Its worth it! Here is the main game: You can explore, adventure, explore caves, build, mine, fight monsters at night. Well, it has limited sized worlds (never measured the world size) But still ITS FUN! Like i said, BUY IT!!!! tottaly worth it! (Btw, only night comes in survival mode in pe).
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This apps is a very good time waister when your bored and very challenging at the same time one if my favorite apps!!!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator is just great..the only (small)  complaint I have is that it is too quiet.  I JUST love it.
B0019NB9A2|5.0|One of my favorite movies, this and war of the worlds from the 50's. Good transfer. If you haven't seen it you should.
1844257797|5.0|Well, not very far away. This Haynes repair manual together with BMW's original repairmanual is a super combo. You will be able to fix almost every technical chalange you will meet on your way, if you have a well assorted tool kit.
B00386EZJU|5.0|I obtained a copy of this from amazon and my music fanatic boyfriend absolutely loved it, he listens to it often, and with the deals offered on amazon, you are sure to get your money's worth. A great composer, beautiful compositions, and if you are a fan of dream works, a must have piece for your collection.
193700788X|5.0|about this book but I do wonder why others have been so negative.  It's a story told by a masterful storyteller and I enjoyed it just as I enjoyed all the other books she has written in the Southern vampire series.  Great imagination to have come up with all these characters and plot twists.  I am sorry to see Sookie, Bill, Eric, Jason and all the others leaving but do understand that the books could not go on forever.<br /><br />Thank you Charlaine Harris for some very enjoyable times reading your books.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|Having been a DC comics fan for more than 30 year, I enjoyed this tv adaptation of Green Arrow's story.  Plenty of plot development through the season with a good finale.  Can't wait until the next season starts.
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|To American mystic symbolism, what Di Vinci Code and Angels & Demons were to Europe, the action is riveting, smart, and credible. This is a fun addition to Dan Brown's series of smart, action packed historical dramas featuring leading man Robert Langdon, a Harvard professor of religious symbology, ala Indiana Jones.  Brown expands our American consciousness, uncovering new meanings in our national treasures, by forcing protagonist Langdon to survive and triumph over deadly evil intrigue through his courage and genius.  I give it a 4+.
B005USZYDU|4.0|Although I enjoyed it very much I really believe teen aged boys and girls would also enjoy it  John Grisham a;ways does a great job.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a nice little game that isn't too difficult but still enjoyable.  Not sure if it will get more complicated the further I go but  only time will tell, I guess.  I like that there is no rush against time as I play during commercials while watching TV.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I enjoy puzzle games, at first I was skeptical of this game, but for a free game it's not bad at all.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Love this game, this app has it all, very addicting game too, would recommend getting it, the short games make it interesting.
B009FB3XTA|5.0|I absolutely adore this product. I would recommend it to anyone even if he is not a fan of the series because the songs are perfect. Thanks once again.
B0016YBFZ8|5.0|This is the classic &#34;based on the truth&#34; violent mafia in America movie from which you can use your own judgement as to which parts were real. It is very well acted and I found it to be very entertaining. There is a lot of violence and it has some filthy language issues so be warned.
B009ZQ8FQG|1.0|Come on!  This is just a bunch or goofy foreigners talking some type of weird english.  Why would I want to listen to foreigners on TV?  Boo!
0688014291|5.0|This book was absolutely great! It is rather short, but gets right to the point! Read the whole thing in one day and was ready to implement it at work!
B003YL4LYI|4.0|There are few reading experiences that I enjoy more than getting lost in Westeros, even if the characters aren't enjoying themselves very much.  Martin hasn't lost his touch for complex characters or suspense, and each of this novel's various strands provides something intriguing for the reader to follow.  At the same time, it certainly suffers a bit from being an in-between book: a lot happens, but the overall plot only moves forward incrementally.  Characters' individual stories sometimes feel like they only go up to the point that could be comfortably printed in an already stuffed volume, rather than following a clear in-book arc (compare Tyrion's story here to his in &#34;A Clash of Kings,&#34; or Jon's to his story in &#34;A Storm of Swords.&#34;  Still, I enjoyed it greatly, and I'll be waiting impatiently for the next installment.
B00D2K40WY|4.0|1. The game itself keeps kicking off on me<br /><br />2. i like it because i want to be like a stylist (kind-of) when i grow up so this game is perfect for me
B00BTHV05M|5.0|I have never owned a OneRepublic album before but after hearing some of the hit songs on this album on the radio and the recommendation of my roommate I decided to pick it up. Wow. This is a GREAT album. I can listen to and enjoy every song on it from beginning to end and while the album has a very pop feel to it all the songs have their own unique catchy sound. I especially like Counting Stars, If I Lose Myself, I Lived, and the unique buildup into a gospel choir in Preacher. Recommend this album to fans of any genre. Just plain good music.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|This application was easier to use before the changes made in early July. The appearance was easier to understand and use. I do not recommend this APP.
B001AT4Y84|2.0|I was impressed (and terrified) by the first Terminator. It was a groundbreaking movie that taught us a very powerful lesson... don't give robots and computer networks autonomy. It was well scripted and acted, with some now famous lines.<br /><br />T2 picked up pretty well from there and introduced a more advanced robotic threat (that physically makes no sense, liquid metal?) but showed very interesting special effects. What saved that film for me was the juxtaposition of Arnold's T1 character from executioner to bodyguard and savior. It is interesting to take the villain from one movie and make him a hero in the next. When he died, I felt sad.<br /><br />But along comes T3 and I have to say: HUH?<br /><br />We have a new robot, a girl terminatrix, who is a cute, perky blonde with the worst attitude imaginable. Why is she wearing stiletto heels? Wouldn't a killer robot go for running shoes? At least she's wearing a pants suit and not a granny dress -- though that would have been hysterical!<br /><br />At first she's seems to be another T2 liquid metal machine, but it turns out, she's even more, and more illogical than is fair to ask us to believe because she doesn't use her machine powers the way a machine would -- and that is efficiently!<br /><br />Okay, so first she has these hand guns (really, her hand becomes a machine gun and don't ask me where she's keeping the bullets) to shoot anyone, including the T1. Only the T1 is sort of immune to bullets (this has been well established in the first two movies) So why bother with the dang gun that won't do anything when fighting him -- and why does he incessantly shoot back. Oh, these must be WINDOWS machines! (sorry, Microsoft). Okay seriously, they do it because they think the audience likes to see guns firing and gets a thrill out of things shooting other things with absolutely no results except to innocent bystanders, who get splattered all over the place!<br /><br />Well, the gun jams or something, so the terminatrix (who is beginning to make me remember dumb blonde jokes) goes for the next super weapon, a flame thrower! At this point I am having flash backs to computer shoot-em-ups where the player can pick from an arsenal of weapons... real original concept there. I guess she wants to burn off Arnold's flesh - which works as a gross out device in the movie, but makes no sense in dealing with a titanium (or even stronger) machine!<br /><br />Why doesn't she have a welding torch as a weapon? She could WELD Arnold to a fence or something like that (ow, that would hurt). Or what about the old tried-and-true spinning saw-blades-of-death? That's been around since the 1920's and even an episode of Doctor Who went with those!<br /><br />Why does she need weapons, or pants suits or any of this stuff when with a little help from the script writers, she could have used the greatest weapon of all -- a BRAIN! Let's think here...<br /><br />She has a mission - to kill a bunch of people, including John Connor. She has the remarkable ability to remote control other machines through networking and nanobots but doesn't use that ability to kill her victims in their own homes -- with their own devices! Aren't machines supposed to be efficient? A self propelled killer vacuum cleaner can be pretty scary.<br /><br />Yeah it may seem strange, but it could have made a terrifying movie. People being stalked by remote controlled killer appliances! And she could have been the mastermind of it all, sitting in a office tower watching on her laptop through security cams, as victim after victim screams and dies a tortuous death while she laughs at their suffering. Okay I think we have had some movies like this before, but with a perky blonde robot-from-the-future as the villain? I think NOT. Now THAT would have been a villain! But then we'd miss out on all those impossible-to-believe car chase and destruction scenes.<br /><br />There is a pretty well documented branch of science called physics. The filmmakers seemed to have thrown that out the window. When the terminatrix is driving the HUGE yellow crane truck at what seems like 60 MPH no less (yeah these things can sustain that speed for a long time) she swings the arm/boom sideways to wipe out all sorts of stuff (including annoying traffic lights) and the truck doesn't even lurch with the shift in weight! Oh, and it doesn't break down! Uh, most of the stuff we make today does break down if we slam it into a building, it really does.<br /><br />Okay, the whole scene is for the chase, not logic but come on, give me something I can believe! Let's at least give a passing nod to reality!<br /><br />I also missed the part explaining why the terminatrix took so long to overtake the T1's inferior CPU. I mean, she got police cars to drive by themselves in no time -- even where there is no actual mechanical way to remote control the steering or gas pedal -- no motors on those things-- right? Or is it the nanobots doing it all, and HOW is she able to control them so well when she is kind of busy driving that crane truck at 60 mph with the boom being sideways and Arnold stuck to the end of it? Come on guys, a little common sense here, please? I know these future machines are ultra-sophisticated, but I don't think even Superman has that level of concentration or multitasking ability!<br /><br />What was good about the film was of course seeing Arnold again. But he didn't have too many 'Arnold moments'. It seemed like they couldn't figure out what to do with him and relied on what we knew from the first two films. There IS an interesting reveal when the T1 explains who sent him back this time and why. It would have been far more moving if the script writers had made John Connor and the T1 develop a much stronger bond, as they had in T2. I would have liked to see a development along those lines. They had the time to do it, but they missed it. And finally, the ending has a sort of unexpected twist, I'll grant it that, but before we get there we have to watch T1 and T3 in a truly brutal \\"duke it out\\" in a bathroom.<br /><br />Unfortunately most of the film focuses too much on explosion after explosion (is the fireworks industry funding Hollywood these days?) and relentless destruction with some gruesomeness (Arnold cutting himself up to get to different machine parts, for example).<br /><br />Summary<br /><br />This movie missed the boat.<br /><br />It could have been so much more, and really moving and clever.<br /><br />Well, it moves alright, from one explosion to the next, one useless spray of bullets to the next. Here's the problem. After a while this stuff is just annoying!<br /><br />As it is, watch the movie for the explosions and the vast destruction of property (if you like that sort of thing). Wait a long time for the two or three very brief shining moments in the film. Get the surprise ending and say, \\"Ooh, I get it!\\".<br /><br />Then sigh and go do something else.<br /><br />Whatever you do, don't try to fit logic into it. It has so little, it is a shame.kers seemed to have thrown that out the window.

B007MDB71O|5.0|One of the first books I ever read, and so after many decades I was excited when the film came out. Thanks to modern technology it worked! Of course, Stanton's direction and superb acting helped. All in all, a delightful film, and I have to express extreme disappointment in how Disney handled the promotion. I can only hope there will be a sequel.
B00CHI5B7A|2.0|My husband wanted to rent this to watch, so I finally gave in and we rented for our Friday night entertainment. He was almost embarrassed about selecting this movie. One word: BOGUS! He loved LA Confidential and thought this would be similar. We couldn't believe Sean Penn agreed to be a part of such a silly movie...
B009RH9FR6|5.0|The case is great. It works well with my Kindle Fire HD and protects it quite well. The leather is good quality and is attractive as well.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|A different take on what might be out there.  Most si fi assumes we would be the baddest on the block or would some how beat the other guy no matter what.  I liked the way the. Story left that in doubt.  Also liked the writers approach using the elderly.  Perhaps we could make some changes to Obama care.
B007MDB71O|5.0|I didn't go to see this at the theater and I am sorry I didn't! The whole family loved this movie and we have watched the DVD several times already!
B007G51UV0|3.0|My motherboard was bad out of the box.  I know there are always going to be bad apples in the bunch.
B001BR5NN0|3.0|The likable cast makes up for the cliched script which isn't nearly as deep as it thinks it is. Much better when it doesn't take itself too seriously.
B007VDN1PA|3.0|This film scanner has difficulty with maneuvering film through the scanner. It basically just takes a photo of the film. And as everyone else has stated it scratches the plastic film holder easily. Maybe even too easily. Scanned in 300 photos and already the plastic film holder has TONS of scratches showing up on each photo. I've even try to use a microfiber cloth regularly to clean it up, but that doesn't help. I think they should use real glass instead of plastic, then this product will probably start getting better reviews. For $80, I guess its worth it.
1623420148|5.0|This book was such an amazing read. I started it this morning, was almost howling with laughter on the train, read it at lunch and just finished it a little while ago. Emma Chase's depiction of Drew as a NSA free wheeling, sex loving guy was so brilliant and on target. He is the man you want to hate for being an egotistical ass, but can't help but love him for those same damning characteristics. I loved Kate, her strength and humor and sass and for being true to herself.<br /><br />I laughed, cried and roared with how the story unfolded. At lumch time today, I told all of my co workers about \\"Tangled\\". Hopefully, tomorrow, we will be able to talk about it.<br /><br />Five extra large, extra wonderful stars for this book. I can't wait to read the next one, \\"Twisted\\".
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Love this game my grandchildren love to play it also specially because it has dragons in the game he is occupied for hours!!
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|The main story was great! It was captivating and suspensful, thrilling and exciting, everything we love about Dan Brown! My only reason for the low stars was the plot ended with about 10% of the book left and I was not happy with that subject matter. It was all about God and for me that was rather boring. I would recommend this book to Dan Brown/Robert Langdon fans though!
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|I feel that Tom Cruise is not the right actor for this role, considering that characterization of Jack Reacher indicates he is more than 6 ft tall, but he did an ok job in the movie. The action sequences were looking a little too contrived. I saw the movie only because I am a fan of Lee Child's Jack Reacher books.
B000B5MI3Q|5.0|The 007 is a great fit for my smaller than average hands and wrists. It is easy to set and seems to keep accurate time, after 2 weeks of use anyway. You can almost read by the luminescence the face provides.  I wanted a dive watch to use with my SPG as a backup to my dive computer.  I have done 5 dives to a max of 73 feet with it.  It shows no sign of water seepage issues and the bezel is firm yet easy to set. I am statisfied with it and would recommend it.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|I have a small family birthday party for all the little ones, and they begged me to rent this movie for them.
B00BKU9ZFU|4.0|Mere fact she shows taste is so rare -brava! And only twenty-three.<br />Her rendition of Lull in My Life is lovely.<br />Expecting great things from her!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This is my very favorite game to play, my mother got me to playing it and now my wife says that is all I do now. Oh well it is fun.
B00CHI5B7A|5.0|Forget the haters and this is NOT a comedy as one ignorant reviewer stated. Its the story of an ex boxer turned gangster trying to strong arm Hollywood for his own piece of the pie. He even snubs the real Mob out of Chicago that tries to move in on him.<br />The acting is superb on all accounts. Sean Penn serves up a top notch performance, he is incredible. The action is great, the story is great. One reviewer said its full of cliches that have already been done, well guess wht dummy, these so called cliches happen to be truth and the story has been around for more than 60 years, so if there are any similarity's in the story to you just remember anything else youve seen was probably copied from this story.<br />For the negative reviewer that said he had to take the movie out after 15 mins because he couldn't get past all the smoking....lol..lol..lol...if seeing someone on a movie smoking a cigarette in a setting of 1949 bothers you that bad then I feel sorry for you.<br />If you like action, gunfire, and a serious story setting that helps you get to know the characters with a great TRUE-LIFE ending, then get this movie.
1432794426|5.0|I grew up with Michael in my world, and I have read many things about him. Most of them were untrue, and I couldn't understand how the adorable, little, doe-eyed boy with the voice of an angel could come to be so hated by the world? How could they accuse him of such horrible things when he did so many wonderful things for people around the world, mostly children.<br /><br />When he was murdered, my heart stood still! How could such a man survive in a world of such hatred? Why was he persecuted, so hated, when all he wanted was to\\"Heal The World\\".I began reading, researching, devouring everything I could find, but 99% of it was the same old hatred-filled tabloid garbage that is still being recycled and split out verbatim four years after his death!<br /><br />Karen Moriarty has written a wonderfully insightful, and sensitive book about not just Michael Jackson the entertainer, but about Michael Jackson the human being! It was a revelation to read something positive about this man who only wanted to to good in this world and be loved in return for who he was inside!<br /><br />Michael, we love YOU MORE, forever and always! Lies run sprints. Truth runs marathons. Michael Jackson  May HIS truth NEVER be silenced!!
B00280LYIC|5.0|When do you ever just let your imagination take you to a place of wonder and hope. In this book that is what you do with Percy Jackson and his friends. So, watch out for monsters always have a pen on hand and be ready for Greek mythology to be after you.
B006YTTVHO|4.0|This book is really good to star off gaining some people skills. Content is presented in a very simple way that even a child could understand. I like it overall.
030789701X|5.0|I got this as a gift to my Skyrim obsessed husband.  The hardcover is a lifesaver, if you use your guide a lot you will be happy with this.  There are so many extras that it makes it worth buying even if you already have the original!  The price is right and any Skyrim fan will love it!
B00B2QA646|1.0|I usually really like period pieces but the way this one was set like a play was interesting but took away from the movie I think. I was really disappointed. Esp since I bought it and now own it... :/
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I was looking for something new to read and this series popped up in my recommendations.  I don't usually read sci fi, but this description intrigued me.  Then I started reading the reviews and none of them were remotely negative.  They all mentioned how incredible the story was and how hard it was to put down. The other reviewers were right--this is a great series.  I could not put it down.  I ordered the second book in the middle of the first one and preordered the final book.Fantastic book.  Amazing.
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|I have read all his books, which were fantastic, but this one moved me unlike the others - this is a truly beautiful book which I will treasure and read again and again.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Very entertaining, great cast; my husband and I both loved it and can't wait for the sequel which I've been told will be soon.
B00D5O7BPU|4.0|It really is something like a hands on training guide. Just missing a few key factors such as recoil and the smell of weapons fire. All in all it's a nice app to have.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Extremely fast and easy read, was entertaining throughout and have purchased the next book in the series. And when I finish this one, will purchase the next.
B004KA9VGA|4.0|A good tale in the world of witches, vampires and demons. Didn't stop me from putting it down. Very enjoyable.
1564148793|5.0|A must buy! It has helped me a lot! and open my eyes a lot wider. And has actually helped me with what I was going through.
1591391105|5.0|Does a good job at categorizing different roles/projects and how to navigate to best succeed after transitioning into a new role.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Easy to use and is no different than the desktop application available. You cannot update certain info though, such as your payment info.
B006H5120E|1.0|3D stopped functioning within 10 minutes of the beginning of the disc, thin black and white digital lines appeared throughout the picture for several minutes without disappearing so we terminated the viewing.
B005S9ELM6|3.0|I have just received the above; thank you for the prompt delivery.<br />I am having some difficulty with the &#34;new&#34; condition status, as ordered.  A notation stated it was &#34;repackaged&#34;;  missing were the usual inserts, as well as the sealed untampered packaging typically seen with a new DVD.<br />Troublesome.
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|I think I could have gotten into it more if they didn't have James Franco or Mila Kunis in it. They just sucked. I felt like they could have cared less about their role and it wasn't believable at all. They were just bad all around. I really wish they used less known actors that haven't been in a million other movies.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This is the first time I've ever given anything five stars. This game is fun and gives me a chance to sate my competitive side when I don't have a chance to get out. Love it.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I was very excited to see a new book coming out by Khaled Hosseini as I was a huge fan of the Kite Runner and really enjoyed his second book as well.  I got it from the library and was glad I didn't buy it like I'd originally planned.  The book feels disjointed and overly long, even though it isn't really.  As soon as I'd get involved in a set of characters and storyline, it would switch to new characters, although everyone was related in some way.  He did a really good job drawing you into a character and then he'd summarize their entire future in a few paragraphs and switch to someone else.  It felt more like a book of short stories and I had to make myself finish it as I was expecting it to all come together in a way that would make the journey worth it but it never did for me.  Obviously lots of others feel differently as there are a lot of 4 and 5 star reviews but this isn't one I'll be recommending to friends.
B00C7NKPPS|5.0|Been waiting for years for this too happen.<br /><br />Remastered and sounding better than before. You do not need to be a major wings fan to appreciate the sound quality, of one of the best live albums ever made.
B00CATSONE|4.0|I was disappointed in the preachy and distracting first part of the book. It seemed to take forever to get to the life of Tesla himself. Expounding on the nature of genius and 10,000 rule Ad nauseam was unnecessary. Because of this flaw I could not give the book five stars. I would suggest an editing of that part of the book.<br /><br />Once the book settled down to the life of Tesla, the tone and writing became engaging. Well worth slogging through the &#34;foreword on genius&#34;.<br /><br />Currently I am 83%of the way through the book and therefore cannot attest to the ending of the book. Did the author wrap up the premise of genius with the life of Tesla? You will have to buy this to find out.<br /><br />As I read, Tesla had many &#34;failures&#34; in that he was beset on every side by Edison and his minions. I felt very sorry for such a genius and the fact that he had to fight for every positive step that he took. I have ended up hating the very man (Edison) that I used to admire.
0770437400|5.0|If you're a zombie lover this book is for you. I found it hard to put down once I started reading it. it is a unique book where it's actually a collection of stories told by different characters. The movie doesn't really follow the book at all but it makes sense because when you read the book you'll see that it would have been impossible to make a movie that follows it straight up.
B008KHG2K2|4.0|I have a small collection of Superman statues and action figures. I recently added this figure to my collection and it is a great find. Worth the cost to a real collector. Love it. I actually bought the action figure as well that looks like this statue.
B0001ARCFA|5.0|You do not need to spend hundred of dollars to get great studio headphones. These are for mixing down in the studio, and are perfect for that. I recommend these for home recording and mixing down.
B00CUWWLWG|1.0|This game would be fun except that the internal clocks in the game are off so that it takes more time to level up items than it should and now after a few weeks it got glitchy and won't open even though I have a good internet signal and Amazon Game Circle reloads.  The game is free, but why put out a game that won't load after you spend time trying to level up the game.  If I figure out a solution I will amend this review, but for now-- don't bother downloading it.  For too many folks it just appears to stop working on their tablet.  I have a Kindle Fire HD.<br />Update Note: I found a potential \\"fix\\" online.  Since the game is synced through Amazon game Circle, you can uninstall and reinstall the game.  It saves all of your treasures, buildings etc.  That worked for me.  BUT-- also online the folks who posted that info where I found it said that it may not be a permanent fix.  The person had to keep doing it to make the game work.  But at least you can get back to your game.  Still rating it a 1 because of the hassle.<br />Update: One week later it crashed again and despite deleting it and downloading it 3 more times --it still won't load. This is not worth the effort. I wasted so much time leveling up everything an then the game crashed and won't reload.  That is not fun.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is so awesome and again I love it! Because it's so realistic! Again again I<br />love this app!
B0046B3QTG|4.0|My neighbor was raving about the sequel currently in theaters, and convinced us to go watch it. We don't have human kids (we count our pets as kids), so we hadn't seen the first one yet.<br /><br />This movie was much better than we anticipated. The graphics were great and the story line was unique and witty enough for adults.<br /><br />We streamed the HD version on our Panasonic Vierra TV via Amazon instant video. The resolution was just as good as Blu-Ray 1080p, and better than that of Comcast On-demand videos which are 1080i.
B003G4W49C|5.0|A delightful exploration of humanity and tolerance. I loved it! I would recommend it to the most casual and the most dedicated reader alike.
B00D8OHPF8|5.0|I've been a Joe fan since the early 90's and he definitely doesn't disappoint with this album.<br /><br />Since my purchase, I've played it exclusive of other music in my car and at home.  That being said, by the 10th listen, I have realized that I love all but one track on the entire album.  The sequence of songs and use of recorded & live instrumentation is masterful.  Although the blending of voices  between Fantasia and Joe is very smooth, I did not care for the song itself.  I cannot yet choose one favorite song but I can easily listen to tracks 7-10 on repeat.  Finally someone knows how to doubleback to smooth R&B.  Thanks.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Interesting story line that is full daily life drama within the setting of the early 20th century.  The characters catch your attention as they work thru their life dramas.
9382951008|4.0|While I like &#34;And The Mountains Echoed&#34; I do not feel it meets the standards set by &#34;The Kite Runner&#34;. It does not flow as easily as his two other books and at times one feels a little confused as to the transitions between characters.<br /><br />It is, however, still a very good read and I like.<br /><br />Dr. T.
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|Loved it, Kept my attention, Interesting to compare with the traditional Wizard of Oz and Wiked. I would reccomend it.
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|My two year old grandsons loves this game! But then I can't get my Kindle back, so I can't let him play it very often!
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|A compelling storyline that could easily be fiction, but is even more amazing because it's true.  Well written and highly recommended.
B00AB7HESI|4.0|There are some restrictions but in all it is a fun way to spend time waiting at the doctors office or whatnot. It is cool to be able to use adjectives to personalize the objects you use to complete the puzzle/task set for you.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Bring on some more please!  Shocker ending though.  Worth watching.  Starts slow but then reels you in for wanting more.
B00CH26TL8|4.0|This is a fun game - but I wish I could turn off the pay-for-play features as I don't plan on using them. I'm fine with waiting for it to time out to play again rather than purchasing more bubbles, etc. to keep playing - that could nickel and dime you to death, as well as keep you playing longer than you need to (I guess that's the point). And it's constantly trying to get me to connect to FB which I don't care to do. Other than that, it's a very engaging and challenging game with fun graphics.
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|I really wish you had more time to play.It just makes no sense to play for a small amount of time.
1442359919|4.0|Drove to Chicago from Buffalo and listened to this audio book all the way.  Loved it and it made the drive delightful.  Good reader and that is very important in an audio book.
B007GCY8FS|1.0|As a die-hard Reacher fan, I have to believe that Lee Child did not write this book.  Whoever did write it needs to go away in the fashion of bad guys in all Reacher books - quickly and definitively.  Starting chapters by repeating the same text, but for a few words . . . Ending oh so many chapters with manufactured, pithy, faux \\"cliff hangers\\" . . .  Really?  And since when did women in Lee Child books lose so many IQ points?  The real Lee Child used to be OK with strong women.  This imposter Lee Child apparently doesn't have the same level of confidence in his manly bits.  Seriously, two experienced female federal agents are asking Jack what to do EVERY STEP OF THE WAY?  Very disappointed in this book.  Come back Lee .... or don't.  Just don't send your evil doppelganger in your place to dupe us into buying another crappy book thinking that it's really yours!
B0071XO8RA|3.0|purchased based on the reviews and a friend's Facebook posting.  I enjoyed the books but didn't LOVE them.  Thought it would go somewhere, but didn't, which I why I think I missed some greater point/message.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|Wishful back to my child's histories...nice memories, good read to relax and dream again!...you can't go wrong refreshing this way...
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This is the best mystery game that I have found so far for the kindle fire. I can't wait for part 2.
B004KA9UX4|5.0|This book is fantastic for the intermediate / advancing player.  The descriptions are backed up with musical examples, and he also makes suggestions about how to practice the concepts so they become embedded in your playing.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|Was not anticipating to like this movie, but I actually don't mind watching it again when asked to by my 4 and 6 year old girls.  Love Jim and Steve.
B00D8RYV52|5.0|My little boy LOVES this game!!!  I think I got it for 99 cents and it is worth every penny!!!  It's a pretty simple game, you decorate the car and drive it!
B000N5F6OW|5.0|One of my favorite John Wayne movies and one not often available. Glad you had it. Quality was great for a picture this age.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|My kids love all the temple run games. They are still waiting for another version to come out. Easy install with hours upon hours of fun.
B004XDYJRU|2.0|Please fix it thank you I want to listen my radio station against I like tunein radio but now is sock
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|I love the series, cannot wait for the fourth to be available.  I did however hold my breath in disbelief at the end.
B007ZXK08C|3.0|Not a bad read but I really didn't like any of the 2 main characters very much, in the end I wasn't blathered what happened to either of them
B009R659L8|5.0|Very good I enjoyed it was as good as her other books I would recommend it to anyone. Who likes her books
B002PMV9FG|5.0|I am gathering the entire set of Harry Potter DVD;s because I like them so much, love the imagination and fun.
B003XTKMBC|5.0|Im not a collector, but i can appreciate the detail thats been put into this. It really looks amazing. I never really turn on the light up sabers, but its cool that they do anyways. The ukiyo-e style/pose he's in is just awesome. Im a huge fan of Hokusai's Great Wave of Kanagawa - so ukiyo-e plus Darth Maul means no regrets.<br /><br />Bottom line - love it on my desk.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|All of the characters carefully intertwined into a great story.  This book is right up there with Kite Runner and Thousand Splendid Sun's.
B001AQR3JY|4.0|It's another Disney Masterpiece! One that I got for 9 dollars from 2nd & Charles.<br />You can't go wrong...<br /><br />Then again, as with ALL Disney movies, the price is rather high for a 90 minute movie.<br />I have not and will never pay more than 10 dollars for a DVD.  Even a great Movie like this.<br />Buy it second hand from a flea market or used DVD store, and that stands true for any DVD.<br /><br />But I digress,<br />Lion King is an excellent movie well worth it's spot on your DVD shelf next to your other 25-40 dollar Disney DVDs!  ha ha ha :)
B001UV4XHY|5.0|I am gathering the entire set of Harry Potter DVD;s because I like them so much, love the imagination and fun.
B008XG1X18|5.0|love this app. be careful if you don't want to get addicted to something. this is not the app for you!
B00CL1SR7O|5.0|BTR have become more into their music! Their first stuff was very cheesy and lame but we still loved it because it was catchy and fun. Now their new stuff is catchy and fun but each song is different and has beauty and meaning. And the show is HILARIOUS! Can't wait to sing along with them on their tour! :)
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|Download it and within minutes my anti virus told me it was malware and that the app would give out my email and personal info. Not worth it.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|I am gathering the entire set of Harry Potter DVD;s because I like them so much, love the imagination and fun.
B00CWVGBEO|1.0|Why would they cast a Russian actor to do such a horrible accent.  They set up the blockade only to break it down with the bus.  The actors can hardly move because they are so old.  Should have been filmed better and the dialogue is bad even for an Arnold movie...its my own fault though.  I don't know what I should have expected!
B000093FLA|5.0|For sure worth seeing. An awesome movie, great follow up to 2 smoking barrels. One of my favorites for sure
B00785P2QC|3.0|a little too slow and addictive for me. I like games that end sometime in the next week.<br /> I prefer the pay once version.
B00003CXI1|5.0|I am gathering the entire set of Harry Potter DVD;s because I like them so much, love the imagination and fun.
B000HF0IIC|5.0|Love that you can watch it online before it comes to your door. My son was dying to see this movie so not having to wait was excellent. Great purchase. Great movie 100% satisfied!!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I really enjoyed the writing in this book.  I became emotionally attached to the characters and couldn't stop thinking about them.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|Maddox is definitely my kind of man.  Rough, wild and sexy!  A little too young for me, but worth the read just the same.  A great story with great characters. This book is written in &#34;her&#34; perspective.  Loved that a second book came out with his point-of-view.  It made me fall in love with him all the more.  Enjoy, I know I did!
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|McKenna was so absorbing that I could not put down my I pad.  I would like to read more of her work
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this book! It smells like pickled catfish an  looks like a guy who is a female and just about sounds like a blow up poker fish
B0057F869U|5.0|if you like period pieces.....this is a fabulous one.  I love it.....and I love the characters and the actors that play them.
B006RUJST6|4.0|Young characters with a lot of things out of their control to handle, especially at such young ages.  It was a soft read, nothing to wild or intense.
B003ES61EE|4.0|it is nice to get into the small areas on lens works well for what i need colorado is very dusty.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Really good game. You won't regret it when you get it. And it was free how much better could it get?
B0024CEY36|3.0|The book revolves around the dysfunctional Walden family and delves deeply into their lives.  After learning about their lives it finally arrives at a climax that is very predictable.  Not up to my prior Ken Follet reads.  I was dissappointed, having read Winter of the Worlds and Fall of Giants.
B005IQZB14|5.0|A real redemption story (there are easier ways), showing that change sometimes takes drastic measures to produce life-altering and sustainable results.  Her descriptions of the scenery require no photographs to share in the experience, similar to the shared emotions elicited by her life-baring narrative.
B00004SZWD|5.0|I remember waiting for this albums debut back in the day.  It was worth the wait then and was worth it now......Even my 9 years olds love it....
B007VUA7VO|3.0|Well if you have a kindle it gets annoying when your in a middle of a game and you put your charger in the kindle it shows a battery and I already know what the percentage is because of slide down thing but yeah it's a good battery it's just that part that might bug you.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|It's a ok app. My kids like using it to watch their kindle charge. They use it everyday. So I go it for them.
0684857219|5.0|I couldn't be more pleased with this manual. Absolutely everything you need to sculpt your physique into exactly what you want it to be. It is well written and the photography is beautifully done. I'm using it in conjunction with [[ASIN:B00D6KC8M4 The Protocol: The Best Supplements for Building Muscle Mass, How to Use Them & Why They Work!]] and eating right. I've never looked or felt better. Two thumbs way up!
B00AKKTDJY|1.0|I purchased the in app upgrade to unlock all levels..the game re- downloaded on it's on,  deleting my scores and locking the restaurants I purchased.  is this a glitches or a scam???
B003LL3NOK|5.0|Great Movie to buy and watch and I would recommend this movie to people who love lots of zombie action and also recommend the series too because the series is good too
B009AP2G26|5.0|This show is amazing. The singing and performances are outstanding. Lea Michelle is beautiful and extremely talented. My family has enjoyed watching this show and was so glad that it was on amazon and i did not have to wait for it to come on DVD.
B00C391Y3I|4.0|Great performance, great songs, quality sound . Definitely I recommend you. One of the greatest heavy metal bands in the world .
B0027MJU00|3.0|I find the alternating story lines hard to follow. The plot line had potential, but in the end was completely unrealistic.
B00AFEXRME|4.0|Denzel never lets me down.. was recommended to me and I'm glad I followed that lead.  It's a feel good movie at the end.. but won't tell you more.. just glad to see it and that's all I'll say.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Everyone knows the premise of this show so I will not go into that, I will just say that the 1st season to me, is still the best one.  If you haven't started this show make sure to watch it's super exciting and very refreshing as it's not worried with being too PC.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|The show is not an all time favorite or anything but it is pretty good as far as dramas go.
0679805273|5.0|I got this for my sister as a graduation gift (overdone, but it's just so perfect!)<br /><br />It came in great condition- no bends or warps anywhere on the book and it's hardcover, so I know it will last a very long time.
B005LAIIJY|4.0|This is a really good movie!  Nice to see a sense of justice even if people are falling dead every few minutes.. I'm not too keen on that part, but wouldn't be DJango Unchained without it.  Not for kids.
B00D6M86RS|5.0|I had this on PS3 until it overheated and burned out. I decided to get it for my kindle so i could play it again and i must say it is an excellent transition to the small screen. I have bought half the tables available so far and every table is a beautiful and well crafted piece of art. If you are a video pinball fan or a marvel fan.this is a must buy. I love all the tables i have so far(7) and i would recommend fantastic four as first table to buy as it is an all around solid table with a little bit of. everything the other tables offer.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I've always wanted to see this play but the movie was quite excellent. Hugh Jackman has an incredible voice.Russell Crowe was a surprise to me also.
0345529057|5.0|After watching the TV show, I knew I had to start reading the books that go with it.<br />This was the cheapest bundle I could find. It doesn't include the 5th book that's out, but since these books are quite long, hopefully the price for the newest one will have dropped more when I'm ready.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Fun read, suspence throughout, great ending.  Hard to put down right after the first page.  I love Flynn's writing style; it doesn't get old.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This was very good game that kept me wanting to figure out all the puzzles.I recommend this game for those who like to brainstorm.
1452115567|5.0|Bought this book for my husband and he loves it!  Great little coffee table book.  I would recommend it for sure.
B00005JSGK|5.0|the movie is great  and the dvd is in good shape also I will be watching the movie for a long time.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I like to play this game it works the mind to bad it ended I was really getting into it
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I expected a better radar coverage.  It was cloudy while I was looking at the radar/cloud map and you couldn't tell by the kindle fire that it was cloudy.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|The second half of the book is just unbelievable. Hollywood could not write this story. Have plenty of time cause you will not be able to stop reading.
B0041KKYDI|5.0|The story of Aaron Ralston, fascinating the strength,stubbornness,perseverance, and determination which he needed to find within himself to be able to survive such a harrowing ordeal must have been tremendous. if faced with such a situation, how many of us would be able to do as well as Aaron Ralston?
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|This diet is totally doable.<br />Good recipes and tips.  May just be the answer to meeting my weight loss goals.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|Bought this on the advise of a current Kindle user and find it useful and like the color.  Should be serviceable.
B00AHQNHSY|5.0|Excellent, this player is easy and fast. With great design and beautiful UI.<br />Work fine in all Androids devices and read only ALL formats!
B00ADS98FC|3.0|Wanted more.  Singing was good.  The story line was never developed.  Reminded me of Bring it On, except Bring it On actaully had a story and developed it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game its almost like Temple Run but better and the daily challenges are really easy and fun.
B000EYK2GE|4.0|Clapton is STILL God and this album rocks. Great music for a long drive from Ohio to N. Carolina. Combine with &#34;Class of 55&#34; CD = ROAD TRIP!!!
B007GCY8FS|2.0|I have read all the Reacher books and admit I usually finish by scratching my head at the far fetched plots.  But they are usually fun and exciting.  A Wanted Man is just far fetched slow and boring.  I hope this book is just a hiccup in an otherwise good series.
B00A7KKPDK|4.0|I'm not a talk show watcher, so I've only occasionally seen Ellen's show, but I was a fan of hers when she had her sitcom. I've always loved her because she is hilarious and she has the ability to make you laugh regardless of what she is talking about.<br /><br />I love this book because she talks about whatever seemed to have popped in her head at the moment she was writing. There is no rhyme or reason, it doesn't follow logically, and she has a tendency to go off on a tangent. Still, it's funny. Have you ever laid awake at night and had something just pop in your head that made you wonder. Yep..this is that book. This is your brain before going to sleep at night. Well..maybe not your brain, but it's my brain.<br /><br />If your looking for any as semblance of order or your not a fan of chaos I suggest you skip this book.
B000001DVD|5.0|This disc is one of the better def leppard discs. Just loaded with good solid music, and I really appreciate this disc the more I listen to it. A purchase that you would not be sorry for.
B005LAIIQC|4.0|\\"...But could you ever say it loud enough, and fast enough, that they'd be too afraid to finish what they started.\\" - Aaron Cross<br /><br />I loved this movie on so many different levels; the actors, the sets, the action and the urgency of the story. The screenplay was excellent and Jeremy Renner and Rachel Weisz bring so much to the characters of Aaron Cross and Marta Shearing.  What could have been a straightforward, no-emotion plot turns out to be a nail-biting thriller.  The cinematography is great for bringing out the details and adding depth to this incredible movie. The beginning was startlingly quick and real.  The rooftop/street chase was absolutely amazing; the best chase sequence I've seen yet on screen.  The ending was perfect.  I consider this one of my favorite films.<br />The only serious con to the film: The plot was slow to start.  The heart-pounding action did not really kick in--and the two protagonists didn't even meet--until about 40 minutes into the film.  (I believe a movie should be well-grounded and moving within the first 20 minutes.)  But it is a difficult thing to tie The Bourne Legacy to the previous trilogy, and it was done really well, so I'm not overly bothered.  The scenes are quick and sharp, so at least the beginning isn't bogged down.  If you are looking for an action movie that is more than a simple plot with a lot of fistfights, then this is a fantastic pick.
B005LAIHQS|5.0|I love this movie. I'm glad I was able to purchase this product in blue ray. Very clear picture and audio.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Great app for a Kindle Fire.  You have the weather and weather related information at your finger tips at all times.  Had no problem whatsoever in setting the location.  Does the job perfectly.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|my entire funny loved this movie. we watched it over and over. Am looking forward to stop renting and own the movie!!!!!!!!
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Castle has been a fun, savvy ride for five season now.  I like the clean-cut cases, the banter, the wild theories and the  mystery.  Add the NYC setting and the outstanding cinema photography and this is a show worth watching.  Ever since the Pilot episode, this show has been a favorite in my family.  Rick Castle was fresh and original, while Kate Beckett was tough and smart; Stana Katic splays the best female cop seen on TV.  But unlike most TV series, my favorite roles were not played by the main characters, but by the supporting cast.  Alexis charmed me, Lanie makes me smile, and Esposito and Ryan especially stand out.  These are the guys who really get the work done.<br />Ryan's character is my over-all favorite (loyal, honest, noble, appropriately comic, a smart dresser--not to mention the single hardest-working guy in the precinct...Who is it that always comes up with new information while Beckett is staring blankly at her murder board?  Don't know why, but his lines (or is it his delivery?) can get me to laugh even more than Rick Castle.  (Two favorites: &#34;Good thing he was a reader of Russian literature; if he was a Nicholas Sparks fan, he'd be dead.&#34; / &#34;Witness...refuses to...co-operate.&#34;)  I was looking forward to watching a Ryan-based episode, which is why &#34;The Wild Rover&#34; stood out to me.  The viewers (and his squad members) get to see this stand-up detective tackle a case no one thought he could manage...and then get proven wrong.  I loved seeing Seamus Dever's performance in this episode; he had a lot to do and he did it all well, from his Fenton O'Connell act to being every-day Kevin Ryan.  I had to watch the final confrontation scene a couple of times (&#34;Yo, Javi, where you at?&#34;) and loved Castle's unorthodox response  (&#34;Seriously?  I didn't even put on my vest...&#34;) It was great to see a supporting role take center-stage for this one.  Now if there was only a case that focused around Lanie...<br />Don't miss theepisode.  It was funny.  It was suspenseful.  It was touching.  Definitely my favorite in the season, maybe the whole show.  Keep it coming, Castle!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey is an awesome show!  You will love it!  We can't wait until the new season starts next year!  Enjoy!
B0032CVAQQ|4.0|I learned from this book that I always treat my husband they way I'd like to be treated; however, he'd like to be treated differently to feel loved.  This book compiles stories of varying situations you can relate to.  It's been top rated for a while, and it's a must read!  I didn't give it a 5th star because I would have preferred the author to write in a different tone than almost a boastful one.
B001KZIRL8|5.0|This was a gift and is what was expected. Can't say much more about it. I have not watched it.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This story was surprisingly uplifting and sad at the same time.  The details jump off the page while you follow along with the character's recovery.  Anything could happen and Pat 's optimism and struggle lead you through his journey effortlessly.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|I just prefer season 1 to season 2. However, the story was wonderful altogether in terms of what one expects of AHS. However, a few of the moments shown in the story were easy to predict.
B0089LOG02|5.0|This is a book that can not be put down......interesting story about what happened to the children that were orphaned due to  death, illness and poverty after coming to America. The  unjust treatment of so many children that were left alone.....A tragedy that needs to be told to learn from not be repeated! I enjoyed the author making the characters like this could have happened to anyone of us if the time and circumstances were different.
B008XG1X18|5.0|At first I had downloaded Pinterest only because my friends had, but after downloading it I am officially ADDICTED<br />Pinterest has changed my life, seriously addicting, fun and entertaining<br />:))<br />MUST GET
B0054SMIH6|4.0|It is definitely one of the best movies that Matthew McConaughey has made.  It is my second time to view it and still enjoyed it.
B000V5Y1SQ|5.0|It's nice to catch up, it had been a while since I watched these and I kind of missed it.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|Excellent, as expected.<br />One of my best buys
B00992CF6W|4.0|Fun game. Very creative gets kind of boring after you've done everything you can think of. Still great game.get it.
B004EPYZQC|5.0|The Fast and Furious movies are all good but this one takes it up a knotch. The graphics are great and the cars sound amazing with suround sound. Love the cast, love the story line, can't wait until the next one is out on DVD/Blu-Ray
B0036BK6MW|5.0|Though I'd seen it before, this movie always is so great. I always want to volunteer after I watch it!
0425263924|5.0|I enjoyed the 3rd book in the series just as much as the first two. This book is definately a must read.
0618871713|4.0|The images in Alison Bechdel's graphic novel told whole stories in the people's expressions. The narration is sharp and explores her stressed relationship with her father. It's a pity he didn't live to see his daughter mature into the artist she is today.
B00BUADSMQ|4.0|I love Die Hard movies.  This wasn't the best movie out there, but still entertaining for what it was. Worth a watch for an action shoot em up movie.
0553593714|5.0|With the hit TV show airing for the past three years on HBO, the book series A Song of Ice and Fire has absolutely gone viral.  Those who haven't read it or ever heard of it now wish to read it and those that want nothing to do with the books eagerly await the TV series or ask those who have read the books what happens next.  A Game of Thrones, although the title for the TV show, is only the first book in a seven part series of which only five books are currently released.<br /><br />When George R.R. Martin first published A Game of Thrones very few people outside of the die hard fantasy fiends thought of picking it up.  Topping close to 1,000 pages, with extensive geologies, hundreds of characters, and a plot thick with political intrigue it is a difficult book to sit down and get through.  The character set ups alone can be daunting since GrrM has this particular interest in making every character a round character.  However, once you are past that hurdle, the book is an absolute diamond among recent fantasy novels.<br /><br />The story, the characters, the landscape, the hints at magic, the political channeling throughout, the dialog, the creatures, the cities, all of it is enrapturing and once you take a hold of this book it will be difficult to put down.  GrrM captures the essence of humanity and shows us the process of being as dynamic as reality.  The characters are loved and hated all at once, the story makes us question our own judgment, and the events tear at our hearts or harden them.  A TV show cannot properly convey such depth since something like that takes quite a deal of time and energy, but Martin is sure to make us feel this way within the story itself.<br /><br />It almost needs no introduction after the sensational HBO series, but it does require some guidance for those who have not heard of it despite the cultural giant it has become.  The Stark family take the front stage in this book and win our hearts with their old world pride, honor, and dignity.  They are from a cold, harsh land, the first major castle and town south of the infamous Wall which is the land's metaphorical boogeyman behind the closet doors.  Eddard and Catelyn Stark along with their children, including but not limited to a bastard son, are swept into the political way of life when their King, Robert Baratheon, requests Eddard to sit on the High Council as Hand of the King.  Essentially, Eddard, or Ned, will help rule (more like just plain run) the kingdom's affairs in far off, southerly, King's Landing.  What follows is an ever-flowering rose that is hardly fragrant and hardly polite.  The world shifts and the Game of Thornes begins.<br /><br />Absolutely worth the read, beyond any shadow of a doubt.  My only recommendation is that if you are NOT the strongest reader or you are leery of beginning the book what with the flood of characters to digest then watch the first couple episodes in the TV series.  That will help to insure that you will know exactly who is important and who isn't in the grander scheme of things.  Though I usually do not make such a recommendation, it will help if you feel that you need it.  Otherwise, plow through and I promise that those that are important will definitely shine as you pursue this absolutely groundbreaking, unforgettable beginning to an ever-evolving tale.gnity.

B0063FGG22|5.0|It held our attention from start to finish.  The quality of the cinema was excellant.  I would recommend it to everyone.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|It has trains and I like how it gives you new people because it's boring with the same<br /> people all the time.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|Takes too long to get moving, and yes I'm usually a fan of the off the mark movie. But this one was...off the mark.
B002UBRFDC|5.0|Arguably an awesome mini series for its time. Well written screenplay following the book as well as television/movies can.<br />I loved the movie and the book.
B007EECSFA|5.0|This was the month's selection for my book club.  I just returned from our meeting and EVERYONE loved it!  This seldom ever happens.  It was well written with an interesting surprise twist.  We would all recommend it.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|This game is amazing don't get me wrong but there are some flaws. Like 100 dollars for 1,700 coins. I can make that in a split second!  But on the other hand this game is great. The graphics are good and the battles are intense. There are tons of troops. This game is worth getting.
B001XCWPAM|5.0|My husband got onto me because I had not seen any of these movies. He said they are great movies, and he was right! I absolutely loved these movies. The packaging was also great from this seller. I actually like how each movie is on its own DVD instead of like a trilogy disk. When I received this, the box was in perfect condition, and completely sealed. I got my son to watch these movies, and he loves them too.
B007MDB71O|5.0|this movie was awesome! Saw it in theaters and I still had to come back and get it on dvd to see it again.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|I so enjoyed watching Hugh Dancy evolve as Will Graham that I didn't realize that Mads Mikkelsen had completely won me over as Hannibal without my even noticing it.  No matter how much I love Anthony Hopkins as an actor, I no longer think of him as Hannibal (not that he cares).  Great series with wonderful acting and very involved stories.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Love this app my daughter and I play all the time.  It is great for long car rides and for the doctor's office sitting in the waiting room. It's awesome :)
B009ZQC7MY|3.0|This review is not about the content of the show, which was only slightly legging from the prior seasons.  It's not getting better; ti's more of the same. And if you are like me, and binge-watch it in one-two days, you may even get bored by the end of it.<br /><br />By beef however is with Amazon Instant Video's audio quality.  British English is already a challenge, but combine that with the muffled sound that I have never encountered with, say, Netflix, and you'll come away quite disappointed.  Not all shows are muffled, but this one was particularly so to the end!  I don't know if it is my TV (LG 47LW5600) or what, but I have no issues otherwise with any other sites or shows.<br /><br />If anybody has faced the same problems and knows how to resolve them, please post your response, thank you.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|First things first. Wow! I had one of these once when David Tennant was the Doctor and it didn't work out as well. It only had 2 sound effects and didn't have the UV and invisible ink. Second, it broke within 2 weeks. But with this one, it has 4 sound effects and is a lot more durable. The batteries still haven't run out. I wouldn't give this to kids younger than 6, but I recommend it for a present or just a toy. It's a bit pricy for it's worth but its a very good toy.<br />Love it!
B006GKHE6G|5.0|I love the racing genre and have a few in my gaming library. This one has you start off with three types of water bikes and four or five water tracks. As you get better the game adds more tracks and more bike choices. The graphics are stunning especially the water effects. Each track is beautifully designed and very original. You are able to adjust the controls in the settings so that you can find the proper steering sensitivity that best fits your taste and skill. I am glad to be adding this game to my collection.
B007MDB71O|5.0|Buy This Movie, Its Great! Also Go Like John Carter Back To Barsoom The Sequel Campaign On Facebook. Buy It Today
B0006GAI6Y|5.0|Its very nice to just put this movie on and go about your business and enjoy the soundtrack and flow of it.
B004HW7JI8|5.0|I loved it was really interesting fun and just so amazing and intense. I love this dvd so much. PRETTY LITTLE LIARS
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|At first I wasn't sure how good it would be but since I loved the original Lord of the Rings movies I thought I would give this a try. Like the originals it can seem to drag on a little bit at times but there are other moments that make up for it. I enjoyed this movie and plan on buying the others when they come out as well.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This game is a lot of fun. Need to expand often so credits are necessary but a really addicting game! Eats up my battery though...
B001CDWFPC|5.0|Great Bible Study, the maps and the tables are invaluable to understand the word of God. Highly recommend it to the serious Bible student.
B000GG4XJM|5.0|Fantastic music to sing along with, and The Boss's voice is awesome singing these folk classics.  The lyrics are great, and love the horn section.  All time classic
B004BRQYJ4|5.0|Both Cher and Christine are amazing on this album. Definitely worth buying the whole thing instead of individual songs in my opinion.
B005LAJ16I|4.0|Started out a little confusing but the got me hooked. Very well done and lots of excitement. Fits in with today's technology - NSA and other agencies.
B002UZXJA6|5.0|I totally loved the songs on this CD. I've always been a Celtic woman fan. The service was outstanding. I would definitely order again in the future.
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|This book is the definition of a perfect storm all wrapped into one. Throughout Delirium you will travel through the ups and downs of this thing called love. Never have been so inspired to follow my heart. When love is against the law, you will do anything to reach it; to reach freedom. Lauren Oliver has captured a tale of love and determination in this amazing book. If love a disease, I will that the infection any day. Bravo!
B00AQMQBKK|5.0|Had to give this 5 strars. I confess I haven't played the tabletop version of this game, but I've played Arkham Horror, & read all of Lovecraft's stuff, and this really captures the feel. This requires a lot of thought and strategy, and there are enough options, variety, and random elements to give it HUGE replay value. Easily worth the cost, as are the expansions. This is a perfect design for tablet/app-style gaming. I you're a Lovecraft fan or just like challenging/strategy games, don't pass this up!
0385536828|4.0|Mc Ewan capably handles the narrative of a smart young woman who is in over her head. The letter she receives at the end of the story is written masterfully.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|I love the mind of Neil Gaiman.  The way his narratives weave their way into fantasy is amazing.<br /><br />This book does not quite measure up to American Gods, but not many novels do.  The scope is less expansive, and the ending is not long enough to get the drift of how things are resolved.<br /><br />It is definitely worth reading because Gaiman's prose is always a treat.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|It is so much fun. It won 31 times out of 39. You must get it!!!!!!! I'm usually not a big fan of games like this but it is so fun!!!!!!!!!
1849904251|5.0|There's nothing I can really add to all the scores of good reviews for this book.  If you love Sherlock this book is a treat!
B0028R3G5O|5.0|she's versatile, creative, innovative and soulful. my 6 and 8 yr old god daughters resonated with her music as well.
B008CJ0KBU|5.0|Lost Girl is sexy, funny and action packed.  I love the bo dyson relationship and want them to stay together.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I like the game it is very time consuming and enjoyable for those who love brain games! You need to at least try it!
1400069289|5.0|Explains clearly about habits and how they work in real life. Although some contents are long but still it is a good book as it goes deep into topic. The book is basically psychology book. Helps to understand of how it can be used in business or how it is been applied in business.
B00006IM9Q|4.0|The CD did arrive within the time period as promised, but there are a couple of glitches on the cd itself. For the money paid, teh condition of the cd is acceptable but a bit disappointing.
B008220BLG|5.0|I love this movie it was funny, action and a love story all in one.  I didn't think I like it but I was wrong I love it.
B0086700CM|5.0|I think it&acute;s totally AWESOME! Totally a Five star game one of the best games I've played k bjvjvjchchchvhchchggjgjg igigig
B004QOB8SO|5.0|I never liked Sherlock Holmes, and only watched this because my daughter insisted it was fantastic. I agree with her. This is Holmes as you've never seem him before - young, in today's world, and possibly even...sexy? The writing is witty, plots van be a little thin but it doesn't spoil the mood, and the actors are great. I really enjoyed watching both seasons and even watched some episodes more than once, which I rarely do (as Holmes speaks very quickly, it's also necessary to understand everything he says).<br /><br />If you like Sherlock Holmes - and especially if you don't - you will enjoy this.
B000K9L32U|4.0|The music is right up there with much of the pop music you hear on the charts these days. Some of the songs skate the edge of adult contemporary, but still very listenable.<br /><br />To be completely honest, the tracks don't quite compare to those on Progress or Progressed.<br /><br />Personally, I recommend working backwards with your purchases. Start with Progress/Progressed, then pick up The Circus and round out your listening with Beautiful World.
B0091REZMW|3.0|Seems a bit glitchy at times but overall a good game. Wish energy regenerated faster but maybe I'm just impatient.
B00846REIS|4.0|I should have read this before Fifty Shades. I like the characters better. Just thought it was odd that the story line followed so closely. Scared to read number three for fear it will end bad.
B000002IO1|3.0|Bought just for my husband's enjoyment.  Black Magic is fantastic but that's about all.  Maybe just not my type of music.  Even he said that Black Magic is what sold him on album.
0345803485|5.0|Some may feel this a little too much, but personally, I enjoyed this very much! Try it, I am sure you will like it, IF YOU ARE OPENED MINDED !!!!
B0038M2AZA|5.0|This is such an amazing movie.  I saw it on HBO and enjoyed it so much  (the story and the acting) I sat down and watched it 4 more times in a row.  The only other movies I have done that with is maybe Schindler's List, There Will Be Blood, and No Country for Old Men.  I am not a Clare Danes fan.  OMG!  She was bloody amazing in this.  I actually purchased this for my mother because I could stop talking about it.  She finally watched it and said she feels this is one of the most moving, funny, heart breaking movies she had ever seen.  We are pretty opinionated in my household.  I feel we wouldn't steer you wrong.  I am in my early 30s and my mother is in her mid 70s.  To different generations that loved this movie.  Buy it!
B0052REQLK|3.0|I think I'm just tired of self-help books. And how do people know what will benefit me and my situation? So take it in that vein, and it will be fine.
B005R32L66|5.0|I love this app. peeps told me that skype does not work on tablets,but it worked quite well on my tablet.<br /><br />  I recommend this app
B001KL0WJW|5.0|This is a classic movie for all times and thank goodness we live in more tolerant times...gangs still exist. Too bad gangs are not just history but still scary real and mean.
B00CW665VI|4.0|Def worth a read. Light funny & romantic...... Eventually. Love the characters and the banter. Nice not to be a woman's side
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games is a fantastic book and I recommend it to everyone<br />It was a really nice read.<br />Hope you will enjoy it too.
B001NI24OI|5.0|Really good adaption of a real story.  Great acting and good cast.  I recommend it to anyone who loves football.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|Great read.  A lesson in life's purpose and how important everyday is to us. I would recommend it to everyone.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|Some people may have seen the movie before reading the novel, but in my case the novel was read completely first.  Yes the novel may be more philosophical and the humorous observations of the adults that Pi knows more abundant.  The movie stresses the adventure, Pi is portrayed as more worldly, but its the CGI, the cinematography, and the fantasy aspects that are the building blocks of this version.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I'm really glad I got this game. it wasn't too easy or too hard and I cannot wait for more levels to come out.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I first heard about this book while I was still in high school. The library didn't have Slammed so I talked the librarian into ordering it. I loved it so much I read it in a matter of hours! And then I was sad because they wouldn't order Point of Retreat, so I had to buy them both myself; I just had to own both the books.[: This and the rest of her books are a must read!
B005P39GOI|5.0|Great voice, great guitar, great album! I have been wanting to purchase this for a while and am very glad I did.
B00D8OHPF8|4.0|My man JOE is a true R&B artist.  Forget all the hiphop features and crazy hooks dominating the album. nice!!
B000AP04NI|4.0|As I had seen original several times I couldn't get used to the HD version however the story line was the same..
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This is my favorite series thurs far, there are a few others, but this one I am on edge waiting until the next one comes out.
B0074VTHKM|4.0|This was the first Theodore Boone book I read and it was an interesting read. It was fun seeing the judicial system through the eyes of a 13 year old. It was even more interesting watching him handle himself as the accused.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|I think this is the best! Very well done, It keeps you involved through out. I bought extras after I got  mine to give to family. Everyone enjoys them and will show to their friends when they get a chance.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Game is so fun.. love it. It's a must to play. If you love horses you have to play this game..
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I enjoyed the book because it was easy to read and the story line was easy to follow. The ending was somewhat of a surprise, although fitting!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This is too cute! I love the colors and how vibrant they all are. Plus its fish from my favorite movie! I couldn't put my phone down cause I wanted to keep adding stuff. Yep this is a keeper!
B002I0J5FG|5.0|Either game alone would have been worth the 20 dollars. It's amazing how well the story is told with so little dialogue.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|It works and gives my cpu maybe 1-2 degrees difference depending. I used to have Dynex, which that alone pars with this pretty well. Still worthit! 5 stars
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I find this game very challenging but fun. Once you figure it out it all makes sense. I do recommend it.
B00AU15HPC|5.0|Justin sounds just as good as he always does!!!!  The songs are very meaningful, as they usually are!!!  When it comes to song writing you can't beat Justin, Mike, Ray and John !!!!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|What an amazing story. Everyone has to read this touching book. I only read Wonder because I had too, but I'm going to read it again and again, cover to cover.
B0086900TI|5.0|While American secondary education may have flourished nationwide in the previous century, Director Kaye's depiction of a Language Arts substitute teacher's  one month stint in a present day New York city classroom is pathetic, tragic, and comedic.  The numbing, meaningless and corrupted language of high school teens serves to convey the disconnection between student and teacher.  This theme of detachment is echoed in student/parent  and student/counselor and teacher/administrator relationships.  Brody's attempt to control his demeanor and subdue his rage eventually finds a brief, fragile connection with his students.  Many of America's two million teachers will instantly see how the selling of \\"making a difference\\" is a white wash of the dark and disturbing truths within the contemporary classroom.  Brody's character attempts to bridge the impossible gap (the detachment between teacher and student) only to be belittled by students or held in suspicion by his educator peers.  The detachment is psychological in the main; physical to a smaller extent.  Director Kaye's depiction of the teacher's struggle to connect is played beautifully, politely and patiently by Actor Brody who is doomed to failure<br />because of an impersonal, broken educational delivery system.  Parental influence is stymied by broken family units in an increasingly amoral culture.  I am a retired California middle school teacher of 20 years and high school teacher of language arts for an additional twenty years.  I substitute taught for yet another seven years .  This tragic but powerful drama about the need for psychological, emotional and academic connections was painful to watch.  Director Kaye's final scenes imply hope, however briefly.  Director Kaye's focus in this film is on the 20% of students who reject the system and will drop out. In truth, perhaps another 50%  are lost or detached inside the system.  I believe about 30% will ultimately flourish and flower in the system or in spite of the system.  And maybe that is good enough!  Director Kaye's notions are more cynical.
B008BQL77K|5.0|I love this show. I was immediately attracted to the stars' good looks but after watching just one episode, I was totally reeled in. Just finished watching a marathon of season 1 and 2. The series is smart, fun, edgy. All of the writing is really witty. I really enjoy the repartee between the characters. I especially enjoy each character's relationship with Louis Litt. Extra bonus: They also have great fashion. (I was able to identify some of the most fashionable items on the usa website.)
B003UBTX6S|5.0|THESE BOOKS JUST GET BETTER AND BETTER!<br /><br />KAMI GARCIA RULES! This was the best book I have ever read! EVER
B00CWY76CC|2.0|This one might be more fun if there were actual instructions and possibly HINTS.  And I think that Amazon should tell you there are only 10 levels and then you're done until more are added.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love this game!!! Once my daughter and I started we couldn't stop.  Not to hard and not to easy. Very entertaining.
B00847KFDS|5.0|Fogerty's music rides again for all of us! This is old time bayou rocking at it's best. Thank you, John.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I loved this game its awesome.it makes you make the right dissigen on the game so i would love to get the new
B000VWYNNW|5.0|If you like the SRTS DVD and if you like to lessen to CDs and you are a fan this is a great disk. What sets this apart is hearing the MSG concert from one of the stronger years of Zeppelin (after the release of the album HOTH) without the extras seines from the movie and with added songs not in the original movie. The sound on the re-master is great. If you already have how the west was wone I would say this is a great disk any way and Robers vociles sound better on this than HTWWW and some songs are not on HTWWW.
B008OOYALE|4.0|This is a nice time filling game and it's encouraging visiting others and seeing how pretty the dragons get as you progress.
B009NY43NY|4.0|I loved this series, but this one seemed a bit rushed.  Maybe Ms. Harris was getting bored with the series.  I still liked it, and may even eventually read it again.
B00AATV046|5.0|This is one of the best old Christmas movies.  The combination of Cary Grant, David Niven and Loretta Young is fabulous.  I got this DVD to replace my old VHS version . . . what's Christmas without &#34;The Bishop's Wife?&#34;
1781162646|5.0|It's a short King and it's a good one as well. It's perfect for the summer, you may even smell the sea and the beach. It's not actually a who-dunnit-novel and it's not gory or even psychologically complex but the characters are touchy and written very lovely.
B0016CBHXA|5.0|I had to order this movie after visiting Petra in Jordan.  Who doesn't love Indiana Jones and the chance to see &#34;The Treasury&#34; at Petra??
B0099Y2MYK|3.0|all three discs had imperfections on them that resulted in halted viewing and subsequently, missed viewing.  I was not disappointed in the show, it was the discs that were not up to par
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Gaiman has done it again!!! The world he has built in this novel is vivid, dark, and utterly beautiful. A must read for fan as well as those just finding Gaiman's work.
B00AEFY3DQ|5.0|yet another good movie to add to the blue ray collection. i think this is probably tim allens best . it is also a good. funny, sci fi for people who arent big on sci fi and also good for people who are big on sci fi as well.
B009NY43NY|5.0|It's sad that this series is ending but what a way to end!!! I will miss all the craziness that is Sookie and friends. This book wrapped up everything and added a few twists and turns... I simply loved it.
B009HUB40Y|4.0|This game is not only fun to play, it also challenges you to think and move very quickly, in order to not run out of time.
B0028MBKVG|4.0|This was a great story based on the argument of barefoot/minimalist running and that we as humans were &#34;born to run&#34;.  McDougall kept me enthralled throughout the entire book.  Great read for anyone interested in running in any degree.  Has motivated me to look into barefoot running a little more.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|makes my brain work. I like it. Will continue to play these type of games to train the mind. Excel in life.
B005MLP8E0|3.0|I thought it was ok I was a little disappointed because I always heard it was the greatest movie ever made on my scale of 1-10 10 being the best I give it a 6.
B0091REZMW|4.0|have been really enjoying this game.  play till I run out of energy and come back after it restores. would like more energy but I still like this game
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Love playing with the horse.  Just wish we could name the horse. Y'all have to play with the horse.  Have Fun!!!!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|It shed a new light that not all German's who fought in WWII were the evil Nazi's. There were humane (kids) soldiers who had compassion for their fellow man.<br />It makes one realize these were kids fighting against kids 25k ft above the earth.<br />The detail of the story puts you in the cockpit of each flight.
1612680011|4.0|Key differences between assets and liabilities - especially income-producing assets (i.e. rental real estate); general explanation regarding earning/spending differences between American upper/middle/lower classes; some thought-provoking personal stories, notably during Kiyosaki's youth; the author's personal investment history may not be practical for everyone (i.e. low-ball cash offers for distressed properties in sub-prime markets); simple writing in layman's terms; enjoyed the idioms!
006178480X|2.0|There is plenty of action in this novel. All the main characters come close to being killed several times. It's hard to think that they are in any real danger of not surviving as they have to appear in the next Sigma book. The plot is straight forward with few twists. Everyone is in love with someone. I especially didn't like the alternate ending. Just when you thought a couple of good guys didn't make it, they are back alive. May skip the next Sigma.
B007PVHANM|5.0|Just  had seen part of this movie and had to have it. It is great and would recommend it to Marley fans. It give a great history of Marley's life and the music live was another great feature.
0140143505|5.0|This is a short book of letters between a  New Yorker and a London bookseller.  She is an intelligent, wise cracking, writer and he is a quiet and reserved salesman and lover of books.  It is a wonderful 97 page story, that spans 20 years.  The two people build a solid relationship through their letters and care for each other deeply, even though they have never met or spoken.  I can't say enough good things about this small book.  I highly recommend it to anyone looking for something interesting and a bit different.
1781162646|4.0|I like King's narrative style, so that is why I am rating it a 4. Not a scary, creepy type of book, but a very enjoyable summer read.
B00003CX8N|5.0|This is a great film.  It is true to the book in every way but one.  I do not understand the first and last shots.  They were not in the book and kind of take away from the story but they only last a few minutes.  The letters are the dialogue and Bancroft and Hopkins are perfect in their roles.  I would read the book first, if you are going to do both...but the movie stands alone.  The film is a copy of the book and it's wonderful.  I highly recommend it.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Downtown Abbey is the most interesting series I have seen in a very long time . Once you begin watching , there is no stopping!
B0050DZ8J0|5.0|It is a great way to check what is up with your LinkIN status and get updates to see if anyone looked at your credentials.  You must have a LINKIN account to use this though.
B005DN5BE4|4.0|I liked it but there could of been a little more historical content. Too much time in the court room.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I have been playing it and I really like it a lot.  It is simple and not bonged down with many things going on at once.  If you want to play something fun and simple, I would check it out!  It is like pipeworks in a way, but not near as fancy.  I would truly recommend it.
B005LAIIPS|3.0|It was kind of slow for me. I liked the first two.<br /> Like any other sequels, they get less exciting!!!
0393330435|3.0|Read bok which differs from that if seve Job. This Steve more technical and have both feet on the ground fir humanity what he thinks of. However at times bkatful in his engineering talent.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great game well made and couldn't stop! Completely possible to solve which is much improved from other logic strategy puzzles!
B003XQM2YU|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. Perfect storyline, immense characters, and fantastic action! Russell Crowe is one fantastic actor that delivers the plot!
030758836X|2.0|I read this book for my book club. If not for that, then I probably would have trashed it a few chapters in. I am very particular about finishing books, so that would be unusual for me. There was not one like able character in the entire book and everyone seemed to have psychological issues. I guess it would be possible to pull off such an elaborate sick scenario, but it just doesn't seem likely. This is not an enjoyable read, so if you are feeling down and out, I would definitely move on to something else.
B005DNO7MQ|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. Perfect storyline, immense characters, and fantastic action! Russell Crowe is one fantastic actor that delivers the plot!
B003G4W49C|5.0|Very good science fiction with a battle between faces motif.  Reads almost by itself.  The sequels are not good, however.
B00AESN8XY|4.0|I think it looks amazing. Please stop the blood samples and show the disease. And also if you change the blood sample add some colour to the disease.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I LIKE BEING ABLE TO PLAY WITH THE CARDS BEFORE THEY COME OUT. Loving the sliver strategy. Game is realistic and fun.
B004T340QY|5.0|Re-watched this with my family (it was my wife's first viewing). We all enjoyed it thoroughly. The movie is just plain fun. And if you're familiar with &#34;The Odyssey&#34; (on which it is loosely based), it's more of a treat. Well written, directed and acted.
B00DGNO3WE|3.0|it is a good use of time, the music is quite good for the most part (better for baby boomers and older). glad i waited for the home version and didn't see it in the theater.
B005K17RU0|2.0|I used to like this app, but the UI in the latest version is horrid. You have made me switch to the weather.com app
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love playing this game, it has very great graphics and the levels are just challenging enough to get your mind going.I can play it for hours.
B003QSOE0U|2.0|We haven't been able to finish the movie as it keeps stooping even though I have 30MBPs download spped on speedtest.net.<br />Happenned daybefore night as well as last night.
B00B6QXN56|5.0|This was a new artist for me. We had seen him on PBS. Hard to put into a genre. I call it Blues and Bluegrass meets Jazz and a little country and Celtic thrown in
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Very different kind of book, subject matter.  Well written.  Kept me up late reading.  Didn't much like the ending, though.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|I hate it.  I can't make it even move, NO instructions.  TAKE IT off my KIndle. Please & thank you.
B00138EWZ2|5.0|I LOVED THE TWO RECORD COLLECTION OF ELVIS HITS AND OTHER SONGS ON THE CLOUD FOR MY KINDLE AND COMPUTER AT HOME AND AT WORK.
B00CU8OVIM|5.0|This is one of (very) few Cd's that you can play from track 1 till the end without skipping. J. Cole is a BEAST. He writes and produces his own music . . .can your favorite rapper say that? I'm literally going to BUY ANOTHER COPY just so I don't have to transport this from car to home stereo back to car back to home stereo!!!!!
B003B02O0U|5.0|This was a very good book and I thoroughly enjoyed it. This is the 2nd book of John Grisham that I have read and I will be getting more.
0307476073|5.0|At the time I'm writing this review, there are more than 2000 (and counting) reviews on Amazon. So not much to add, really. I just felt I'd like to add my voice here, to say I thoroughly enjoyed reading 'Wild'.<br /><br />It's not my usual cup of tea, actually: 'Wild' is about Cheryl Strayed's hike on the Pacific Crest Trail, from California to Washington, a hike which doesn't just test her physical limitations but also her mental / spiritual ones. Strayed talks very movingly about losing her 40 something mother to cancer, one of the consequences of her grief being (among others things) that her marriage breaks down a few years later. Broken and bewildered by all these losses and changes, with no clear path in life or sense of purpose, Strayed decides to do something quite unlikely: to hike one of the hardest trails in the US without much prior experience.<br /><br />Strayed is such an extraordinary writer--honest, funny, and sometimes searingly sad. The book has a wonderful flow to it and carries the reader along as few books manage to do. Honestly, after finishing this I had developed all sorts of wild ideas myself about hikes and other things I'd like to do if only I had the time, if if if... This is really an inspirational and life-affirming book, and also an honest and heartbreaking story of loss.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|I enjoyed everything about this movie.  Malkovich's character is hilarious and the plot is very clever!  Can't wait for Red II!
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|staying true too the series, hope there is a six season in the works!!  the characters are so believable!!  I&#34;m always looking forward to the next season!!
B0017I1IZA|4.0|I choose this rating maining due to the humor and the suspense throughout the book. I am now reading &#34;To The Nines&#34;
B000VPPMXO|1.0|Product displayed black but received white one.  Put in batteries and did not work.  No clear turn on and off button.  I have another that came with my roomba and it's great.  Did not stop roomba from going through a doorway.  Will double check with different &#34;c&#34; batteries that i now have to go and buy two more to make sure its not faulty batteries.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|exactly as billed. action, some humor.  My son has watched it about 10 times and would watch it every day if i let him.
B000KFB4PK|4.0|I bought this as a birthday gift for a nephew who is a big lego fan.  While it may be a bit too old for a 5 year old, he loved it.  He's learning how to tell time, it is fun colors, and is lego - what not to love!
B0041KXOVC|5.0|You can't go wrong when on an 80's marathon movie madness by watching this one.  I miss these kinds of movies.  They just dont makem like they used to huh.
B00006RG9K|3.0|This is probably fine for die hard Genesis fans who want to own everything the band ever produced.  But it's old, and it shows.  For most people, the 2007 Rome concert video is the one to buy.  Better sound, better video, and a truly remarkable performance from the guys at the end of their long career.  They pulled out all the stops for that one.
B002NT3B52|5.0|My husband and I enjoyed this book and will give it as a gift to a friend who is about to get a new puppy.  We are on our 5th dog, which tells you something about our age, and we found insights we could have used with all our dogs.  We have had a Dachshund, a Basenji, a pure bred Lab, a rescue Lab mix, and now we have a Labradoodle.  Our experiences have been very different, based on the breed and perhaps gender, although the female Basenji's closeness to the wolf probably should have been obvious to us!  We liked the general sketch of dogs, knowing from the get go that dogs differ in intelligence, personality, and temperament.  We are college professors, and so we found Horozwitz's conversational tone much more attractive than the usual academic approach to such a subject.  [[ASIN:1416583432 Inside of a Dog: What Dogs See, Smell, and Know]] We did buy the book from Amazon, and we will send a Kindle version to our friend.
B00D3V85FA|5.0|The first three sabbath albums will never be matched in my mind. They are masterpieces......now that we have that out of the way. 13 is a really good disc ! Iommi and Geezer sound great. Of course I would love to have Bill Ward, but I have gotten over that. God is Dead ?, Damaged Soul and End Of The Beginning being my favorites.  My biggest fear about this album was Ozzy, and I have to say I am very happy with his performance. Not nearly as  \\"doctored\\" as he has been sounding on his latest solo albums. They have come close to recapturing the early Sabbath sound. Easily better than late seventies Sabbath I.e. Never Say Die andTechnical Ecstasy .  Very solid comeback !!
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|Wife loves this movie! It a great movie for someone going through hard relationship. Recommend to anyone who loves Nicolas Sparks.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Wow, I couldn't stop reading, even with details being gone over and over. The ending was different than I expected also.
1451683405|4.0|Prior to reading its first pages, I was somewhat amused by the David and Goliath irony of \\"Free Will\\": How could such a tiny book (less than 80 pages, cover to cover) take on such an enormous topic?<br /><br />Within the book's limited real estate, Sam Harris wastes no time challenging the notion of free will. On Page 1, he begins recounting a horrific 2007 homicide of family members by two \\"career criminals.\\" Harris says that if you were close to the family, you'd likely advocate for the perpetrators' executions.<br /><br />Yet someone viewing this massacre from a more emotionally-detached mindset might regard the perpetrators as \\"victims\\" themselves, involuntarily driven to committing these ghastly acts by their genetic makeup, brutalized upbringing or (as he offers later on), by pathologies such as brain tumors.<br /><br />Harris quickly cuts away from the impassioned debate of whether criminals are (or aren't) acting on their own free will to the more ubiquitous subject of what drives our daily food choices. Using himself as an example, he admits to being clueless as to what ultimately dictates his having one cup of coffee on a given morning when, on other mornings, he enjoys two cups of tea.<br /><br />In a subsequent chapter, he asks why someone can muster the heroic willpower to lose weight (via diet and exercise) during one month, but can't summon those same resources after they've regained the weight. Harris posits that such occurrences are driven by \\"events\\" in the brain that are beyond our ability to \\"inspect or influence.\\"<br /><br />Admittedly, Harris's book doesn't solve these mysteries for us. However, it does heighten our awareness of how we're frequently in the clutches of forces that cause us to do things we can't plausibly explain or that undermine our own best interests. From the book, I'm left pondering such enigmas as:<br /><br />* You take pride in having a clean driving record. One day, for no apparent reason, you tempt fate and run a red traffic light. What happened to your customary adherence to safety?<br /><br />* You go to the supermarket to buy essential foods, yet impulsively purchase an item displayed at the checkout counter. Later on, the item sits on your shelf, and goes unused for years.<br /><br />* A major league baseball player hits well over .300 one year. The next season, he struggles at .167. No matter how hard he tries, he can't get his timing back.<br /><br />* You're concerned about a recent theft in your neighborhood. But at the beach, you ask a total stranger to watch your valuables while you go for a swim.<br /><br />* As Harris illustrates, you wake up one morning with a brilliant idea for a website. Why did this idea suddenly arise from your mind? Why do you have just one brilliant idea, instead of a slew of them?<br /><br />Undoubtedly, the world weighs in with an impressive (and all-too convincing) array of explanations for these phenomena. Consequently, if we need to be anchored and reassured with definitive reasons as to why we behave as we do, we'll seek answers from those we most trust, be they doctors, psychotherapists, clergy, spiritual gurus, or someone we deeply admire and respect.<br /><br />However, from reading Free Will, I'm motivated to attempt a different tract. Although running counter to my own nature of wanting solid reasons for everything, I'm going to experiment with accepting that the mysteries of human nature (mine and others) may remain unsolved.<br /><br />Is such an attempt idealistic and unsustainable? Perhaps. But if emotional freedom and peace of mind really do come from acceptance, I'm going to swim in those waters for as long as I can--and see what happens.ffic light.

B002SAUCBC|5.0|King is a master storyteller, the kind of storyteller who is able to create complex characters: the kind of characters you learn to love and hate, understand and invest in, identify with and feel compassion for. SK builds each characters' back story; and then, he introduces you to them in such a way that, before you know it, you are totally invested in them...and in their outcomes. In &#34;The Long Walk,&#34; &#34;IT,&#34; &#34;The Stand,&#34; &#34;Under the Dome,&#34; &#34;11-22-63,&#34; &#34;Salem's Lot,&#34; and so many others, King develops his central cast of characters...his hallmark. King also blows life into the background characters, animate or inanimate. And then, he shares all of their own secrets, faults, noble ideas, actions, and important back stories too. The background machinery and characters consist of, but are not limited to: The Crowd; a lethal, menacing halftrack; and  The Major. There is a &#34;1984&#34; feel to &#34;The Long Walk.&#34; This is a book you can read in a single sitting...perhaps two. And it's definitely not one you'll want to put down...at least not until &#34;The Long Walk&#34; declares its winner. And then, &#34;Everything will be Eventual!&#34; Enjoy your own copy of &#34;The Long Walk,&#34; it's worth the time to read it!
1623420148|5.0|Great book, very interesting characters and written from a unique perspective.  Hope that there are sequels so I can follow the characters.  Will definately be looking for more from this author.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|First time playing an escape game and I really enjoyed this one. Graphics are good and gameplay is responsive. to touch. Definitely recommend.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Fantastic directing and acting.  If DeNiro is in it, you can't go wrong...and now Bradley and Jennifer, well that's a winner!  From someone who grew up in a house with mental illness, this was a bang-on picture not only of the craziness that happens, but also the hope that with good doctoring and commitment, bipolar doesn't have to ruin your life.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I think its really fun.  But it is a lot like temple run. I like how it gives u presents and jumpy shoes
B00ANYJ3NI|4.0|This was assigned to me as reading for a class.  The book was entertaining and factual.  I was so glad that it wasn't stone dry like some of the others we had to read!
B008M721MS|1.0|This is the worst app ever! It crashes every time I use it and it can't even send messages. My friends can never receive my IM but Skype does work on my computer. I definitely do not recommend this to anyone. It's very frustrating and useless.
B00CCEHW6W|5.0|I'm not super into or knowledgable of the black/death metal scene, but there's aspects I like. It's probably best not to think of this in terms of genre. It's an excellent guitar album with great songwriting and instrumentation. It just happens to feature a lot of blast beating drums and howling vocals. But the songs are very long and expansive and textured, and share as much with shoegaze and other \\"indie\\" genres. It's just a really good album with great heavy songs played really well
B0035KGWR2|5.0|Amy has such a beautiful voice! Her music always uplifts me when I listen to it. All of the songs are family-friendly as well.
B007XELMO4|2.0|When you get the package, it's kind of shocking how little comes out of the box for $80.  It does appear to be high quality and is a great concept.  I just could not get this to work with my body (female) and wear it comfortably.  Ended up returning it and will look for other options.  Really wanted to love this, just couldn't get it to work for me.
B005CRQ3NY|3.0|A good book but some parts make me mad like looking at rowley he makes me sooo mad. And his mom
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Best game ever I play the card game but know I can play at home instead of wait for Friday night magic
B00CH87HF4|5.0|This is one of Gameloft's best games yet!  It has all my favorite things, blood,<br />violence, weapons, and a Medieval background to top it all off.  I definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes any of the above mentioned.
B007XRLGTM|5.0|Every single song on this album is amazing, i definitely think it has to be one of the all time great albums
B007MDB71O|5.0|I am a long time fan of the Edgar Rice Burroughs Barsoomian (Mars) series. I have read them multiple times. Scy-Fy channel tried to do this movie and failed miserably as they departed from the book until it was unrecognizable. John Carter of Mars followed the book pretty close and was completely enjoyable. I would so go and see JC2 as well as buy it.
B004D7GU3M|5.0|Got it as a gift for one of my close friends and he absolutely loved it! This thing is the absolute complete package!
B0095P31L6|5.0|Appeals to children and adults.  I don't know who loves it more my husband or my granddaughter.  It's very clever like Toy Story.
B0001AP13A|5.0|I got it as a gift for one of my close friends for his birthday (loves kanye) and he absolutely loves it!
B007HACDLK|4.0|Flynn's dialog, grammar and word-choice can occasionally pull you out of the story, but his structure, pace, character-consistency, and plot are flawless.<br /><br />Some won't like the underlying theme/message and the characters with whom the narrator un-subtlety sympathizes... But when the dust settles, his legacy should put him in the company of Conan Doyle, Hammett, and Ian Fleming.<br /><br />You could do worse than to spend a few hours reading a handful of Vince Flynn's books.
B00AAU7AI0|5.0|Great book of his, loved it. Am a big fan of his, and this book does justice to his spiritual writings.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Good puzzles that make you think.  A lot of clicking around too.  Not always intuitive.  Overall a good game that can be addicting.  I'll be waiting for more levels.<br />Thanks for the game.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Just easy enough to keep you going but not too hard to get you frustrated. Would like to see more levels
B002GYI9C4|5.0|5 stars! Great action and thought. The characters are great and intriguing. I live him as an author. Great book!
0811821846|5.0|Recipes seem straight forward and good. It's for a young man who loves Star Wars. I think he will be pleased.
B004132HZS|4.0|Pretty good creative writing, humor, storyline and very good acting...this series is better than most on American television right now...
B00BXUG0KU|5.0|My first purchase of anything of Elaine Elias wonderful voice and piano is terrific. Certainly won't be my last purchase she is very impressive
B0025UHKNS|3.0|I'm not fanatical about training.  I like my old GPS watch (the old clunky one).  It had buttons instead of a bezel and it wasn't too complicated.  Plus, you could turn the old GPS watch off, conserve battery and use it for weeks.  This one only goes into &#34;power save&#34; mode and, if you don't toggle off the GPS mode, it continues to look for satellites which kills battery life.  I suppose if I had the time and inclination, I could read the instruction manual and get more out of this watch, but I only need a simple device that tells me how long I've been running, and how far.  Once the data is uploaded, which is very easy with the plug in data stick, the data is very fun to look over.  Sync the data with Google Earth, and you get a nice bird's eye view of your fitness program.
B001J1K5IG|5.0|Enjoyed the actors -- esp. Gene Hackman, and Kevin Costner, plus others-- and the historical correctness, and general delivery, scenery, period correctness and direction.  Excellent!!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like the app. It's interesting so far, the prices are a little high for a beginner but I think with a lot of play it'll be heaps of fun.
B000HVHM5S|5.0|Best intelligent thriller I've ever watched --kept you on the edge of your seat throughout -- hats off to Hugo Weaving, as his portrayal of V stays close to Moore's original character, in every respect --(excellent elocution by Hugo Weaving!). This film is ever spell-binding, and ever mesmerizing;  I have never seen a film like it.  Truly a \\"one of a kind.\\" And, a 'must' to own!!
B00DIMXTBO|5.0|Outin is even better than Outview, although you need to read them in order, please.  These kids (old souls mostly) are true, smart, believable teenagers on whose young shoulders the future of the world may be resting.  I enjoyed this second book and can't wait for the third one, although I am sure that when it's over, I will miss my time with these heroic kids.  Great work, highly recommended!
B003D5X3VM|3.0|I love his voice.  I just did not like the songs as well as I do the ones on the new album.  But, I will continue to listen.  The songs may grown on me since the voice is so fine.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|My daughter loves this book and reads it on her IPAD.  She has read it at least 3 time that I know of so far.
B006OE7XM4|5.0|Wonderful voice.  I love his writing.  I like every song.  I also really enjoyed the band solo portions.  The musicians are fabulous.
B00C1BUYX4|1.0|Streaming froze repeatedly even though I had Wifi right next to the TV.  Probably will not try the HD version in the future even though I have an HD TV
0375851569|5.0|I bought this book collection as a gift for my daughter's French pen pal. Reports have been positive that it has been very well received. The mother stated that the box set was put together nicely and strong. It survived the international trip. As to be expected with Dr. Seuss, the pen pal really loves all the books. She sent my daughter well known French children books and my first thought as to well known American books was Dr. Seuss and he did not let me down.
159463176X|5.0|I really liked Kite Runner and found A Thousand Splendid Suns to be my top ten and have read 2xs since.  So far, And the Mountains Echoed is living up to all I imagined it to be.
B00B9LNJ9I|5.0|She could sing just about anything and I would enjoy it.  This album is fairly current with today's music--even includes a little unannoying rap music on a few songs--blends together well.  Thanks for the album, Dodo.  Look forward to the next one.
B00AS1Q93S|3.0|Tom Cruse does a good job of recreating Lee Child's character.  Tough, intuitive and at loose ends with little to lose Jack<br />Reacher throws himself at what to him is an obvious frame. Fueled by greed, a business has long been killing it's competition to get what it wants but now has run into Reacher.  With the help of the local DA's daughter Reacher is able to work through the attempt to frame him to stop a ruthless machine.
B000HZM4FW|5.0|Jack Nicholson is a master......this movie should be a must see for every person that appreciates the classic movie styles of yesteryear...the plot captures you and takes you away just like a movie should.......enjoy!
B005LAIIPS|3.0|I was dissappointed.  Renner and Weiscz not withstanding this movie is mostly a rehash of all the action in the earlier Bourne movies.  If you've seen the first three you've seen this one.  True the plot is different - instead of Bourne going after a larger CIA entity  the CIA is trying to kill off all its operatives and scientific personel but misses Renner who saves Weiscz.  There's the standard motorcycle and car chase plus the flight for safety across the foof tops. The movie even ends like all the other movies with the possiblity of another episode coming since Renner and Weiscz didn't solve this films crisis.  If you are a Bourne fan you may enjoy this film but it isn't (in my opinion) as good or as well put together as the first three.
B0073PPNE8|5.0|Rene Zellweger delivers a grand performance.......as does Jude Law and Nicole Kidman.......the era of the Civil War is one that no one truly wants to live over again but yet continues to be as interesting as ever.....a must see love story......favorite quote: &#34; I have the confidence of youth!&#34;
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|A very relaxing getaway. The graphics flow like mercury. Effortlessly takes my mind off worrisome preoccupations. My grandson likes it too.
B00992CF6W|5.0|In this game you use elements to survive and your creativity it's learning how to survive there is no goal u just do what u want
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|This zombie alternate tale is worth a watch. It is unique and obviously alligorical in nature. You can identify with the characters and I found it quite enjoyable.
B002HRTMHQ|2.0|Having seen and heard Mayer on Daryl's House (TV show) I was anxious to buy the CD. The CD did not match the quality I expected and remembered. Everything including group vocals were OK until Mayer sang solo: he sounded like something was wrong with his microphone and it was fuzzy and downright unpleasant noise. It's a shame.
1620402963|4.0|An intriguing, at times mesmerizing story. It reminds one of the real story of Soviet spy Melita Norwood, outed by defector Vasili Metrokin in the early nineties. Her daughter and family were totally unaware of her espionage role until the truth was revealed when she was in her eighties. Boyd's elderly spy is believable. However, I think the writer missed the mark when trying to write from a female perspective, especially with daughter Ruth. Perhaps the spy's child should have been a boy!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I absolutely Love it.  It keeps ur mind going and it Gets harder as you go. Would like to see more levels.
B00669MFA2|2.0|I was disappointed by this movie because I was expecting much more. The whole movie seemed very dull and predictable when it could be much much more interesting.
B002U3CCBK|5.0|Beautifully written and very hopeful.  A lovely read.<br /><br />What an amazing idea but underneath it all its about so much more than Salmon Fishing in the Yemen
B009WUAK2M|4.0|A very good action-packed movie. The cast was great. I enjoyed the movie very much. So much that I have it on my Kindle Fire.<br />Damian Fedorko
B007ZXK08C|3.0|This was a good read, but its really not all its hyped up to be.  It starts off really well, but the ending could have been so much better.  think it will be better as a movie.
B00AGKHEUI|5.0|I recently saw Fleetwood Mac in concert and was reminded of all the great songs they have done.  I had &#34;Rumours&#34; on vinyl  a long time ago and decided to update the sound with the cd.  LOVE it just as much now as I did then!  I highly recommend this 3 cd edition!
B00CH26TL8|1.0|I tried this game because it looked cute and fairly easy to play. It might be but without instructions all it is is frustrating! I think it could be amusing if I knew what the rules were but not this way.<br /><br />Horrible experience!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|What a great story, so glad it was told. Easy to read, colloquial writing style.  I was stuck to the pages and couldn't put it down!
0385347774|2.0|the story was dumb....took too long to develop and was too drawn out..hard time keeping the reader interested..I would not recommend this to anyone..I find it hard to believe that this is on the best seller list of most book reviews..
B0045HCJ9E|5.0|Cary Grant usually fulfills all expectations and is perfect in the role of a self-centered ad man whose world is turned upside down. Eva Marie Saint deserved an Oscar for this one. A Must see.
B003AYMZO2|5.0|I seriously can't stop watching the show.  The twists and turns are amazing.  Bryan Cranston (lead character) is incredible.  The show itself is great, but he makes it the best show on television.  If you're a guy, you'll love this show.
B00177YA1K|5.0|Though not a special effect as the next two. It deserves to be seen. Have always hated roaches til this movie. Arrived on time.
B009Y61ZMI|5.0|Soldier is definitely under appreciated in the action movie genre. Kurt's character Todd shares a \\"disposability\\" that mirrors the Replicants in the same Blade Runner universe inhabited by both. Fun fact: on the screen that shows Todd's combat record, one of the battles in which he had fought was the \\"battle at the tannhauser gates\\" which was referred to in Blade Runner as well. You can watch the film many times without realizing they are part of the same canon. When you do know, it adds a new layer to the story.
630471193X|5.0|One of John Travolta's better films. Supporting actors were excellent. Film has a positive message about how we treat celebrity. Film arrived on-time and in good condition.
