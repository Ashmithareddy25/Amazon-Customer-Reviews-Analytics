B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game will be fun for anyone. Whether you are five or twenty five, you will have fun with this game.
B00280LYIC|5.0|This was an Absolutely great book, I've read it at LEAST three times and I've read the rest of the series, and the Hero's of Olympus series. I love them all.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Absolutely loved the trilogy...I can hardly wait for the movie to come out...hopefully soon!  Those that hate this trilogy, shouldn't continue reading!
B008YKGQR4|1.0|This app sucks. It's a waste of time ans it's very frustrating. I have it on my kindle fire HD and its so glitchy I can't do anything on it. Maybe it's a resent bug, but my experience with it has not been worth it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved them both, though the movie was changed.  I have read most books written by Nicholas Sparks and will continue to do so!
0385751532|5.0|The movie is fantastic, very entertaining, and the blu-ray and DVD are great. The new format for Ultra-Violet with Flixster is an absolute joke. it is not a digital copy at all, it is a stream from an account, which in my opinion is useless.<br /><br />Overall the kids and I love the movie, but I will not be buying another \\"ultraViolet\\" or \\"Flixster\\" based movie with the hopes of the digital copy ever being used... its crap
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Loved his references to 80's video games and pop culture. Great story, never boring. I couldn't put it down. &#34;Don't worry, Han will have the shield down. We have to give him more time!&#34;
B008XG1X18|5.0|If your not participating with Pinterest you are missing out... It's amazing the wonderful idea's and the sharing is wonderful.
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|I love games like this. They did a good job with making it interesting. It's not too easy and not too difficult. The only problem I had was sometimes it was hard to press the right thing. That might just be my phone or my lack of finger dexterity though.All in all, it was a fun game. I recommend it.
B001AXJ1PG|5.0|This band is, to me, the Rush of the 2000's. I've followed their music since their second album, Images and Words. They are very, very technical, but do not loose that emotional tie with their vulupous Jazz/Metal/Progressive/Industrial interchanges. A delightful album A Change of Seasons. They medley portion is out of this world, part of it was recorded live, yet the 22 minute title track is an amazing philosopical piece of psychology through out its cyclimatic life. A plus plus to be sure. Thanks Dream Theater for all your amazing work.<br />  Terrence Simpson
B00BJS7104|5.0|First of all I don't understand what the critics were complaining about. The use of the &#34;N&#34; word? C'mon...it's supposed to be pre-civil war America, slavery, bounty hunters, you know the deal. Also IT'S A QUINTIN TURRATINO MOVIE!!!! (hope I spelled his name correctly) This has got to be one his best movies, definitely one of his top 3!!! Most of all, remember this....IT'S A MOVIE, OKAY!!!
B005KELQEU|5.0|Fits my Kindle Paperwhite perfectly.  Shipped quickly and I had no issues with how it was sewn together.  Would buy again and recommend to others.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was definitely a surprise ending, so it kept me on the edge of my seat throughout.  I'm looking forward to the second movie now!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I am so totally hooked on this show!  It just makes me happy to watch it.  This season was even better and more suspenseful than the first 2.  Can't wait for season 4 to start!
0345803485|5.0|i loved this book. i couldnt put it down once i started reading it. Its such a great romance story. i loved how ana made him feel alive and made him face his demons. he learned how to love. i recommend this book.
B0031Q0XCA|5.0|Such a great movie with really superior acting skills, especially Joseph Gorden Levitt.  Enjoyed it so much! Would highly recommend it to anyone that loves a romance or loves a movie about hope!
0061978078|3.0|I didn't care too much for the first book. This one was much better, though at times predictable. Also, I don't understand how a young girl would be able to survive so many of the things that happen in this book, but I guess that is why it is a fiction book.<br /><br />The story continues from when Lena enters the Wilds after her devastating ending from Delirium, the first book. She constantly reflects on a year and a half of time going between \\"Then\\" and \\"Now\\" for chapters in this book. It is pretty cool because it builds up and makes sense for how they connect the two together. In this story we see that Lena is weak and meets new people. She wants to get to know them, one is a girl named \\"Raven\\" who seems to be in charge of a group of people in the Wilds. Everyone has jobs that they do. Lena has now undertaken a task of watching a guy named Julian. Julian is a bit of a spokesperson for teenagers and \\"the cure\\". He has a list of surgeries that he's dealt with, and getting the cure could be dangerous for him.<br /><br />While reading this book I already guessed what would happen in the end of it, and when I was right, I was so not surprised! Now I am hoping the third book is better because I am finally getting more into the story.<br /><br />If you are a parent and are concerned with the content in this book, there is nudity, some lust, a few words of bad words (mainly the s word). There is no sex in it.
B00005O3VC|5.0|I had forgotten all the visuals that are a part of a &#34;film&#34;  Things that a modern audience will not understand.  Still it is a classic and a must see.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|It was just so detailed and it really felt like these accountants were actually real and it was written so well
B0089LOG02|5.0|Felt like I lost my best friend when I was done with this one.  Sad in places but the young gal triumphs.
0553801473|4.0|I've read all of these but never viewed the TV series. A great story with interesting characters even if all the good guys keep getting killed. Dany needs to get her butt in gear, tame her dragons & win the 7 kingdoms back. Need to hurry up get a move on with the story telling before people loose interest. Too many words used to describe minor details.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is similar to many of the other &quot;run&quot; games only better because it's minions. I think the interface is a little easier (only needing to use tilt for special features) meaning you can play most of the game with the device on the table. Plus the challenges are reasonable so you feel like you're actually getting somewhere.
B00DC7NNAC|3.0|This film was enjoyable, but could have been much more...  It doesn't compare to the classic.  Do yourself a favor and watch the Wizard of Oz instead.
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|I like the story but it is a slow read. At times I had to force myself to read through a page because some of the details were really boring. to drawn out. It was a good story.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Once I started playing I didn't want to stop. Hope there is more to come. Wish it was a longer game.
B001KWTBVQ|5.0|I LOVED IT!!!!  VERY GOOD MOVIE.  WILL PROBABLY WATCH IT SEVERAL MORE TIMES.  DREW BARRYMORE WAS GREAT IN THIS MOVIE!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Won't load since that last update.  Loved the game, was shamelessly addicted to it, but it won't work anymore.  Once this is fixed I will gladly give a better review, but until then, one star.  Please please please get this fixed.<br /><br />UPDATE, THEY HAVE FIXED IT!  All my records and bananas are gone, but it's worth getting them back to have my favorite game back again.  Happily changing my rate back to 5 stars.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Challenging enough to keep you interested but not too difficult that you get frustrated.  Enjoyable way to pass some time.  You will be required to submit a review after level 10 if you want to continue.
1741797802|2.0|My wife and I are very long term users of LP guidebooks, approx 25 years.  We don't buy any other guidebooks because we PREFER to travel the budget way, even though we can afford more luxury.  And LP guides have long been the go to books for budget travelers.  We have traveled all over the world.  Late last year while living in Saudi Arabia, we took our second trip to India and purchased this LP book.  We also took along a 2005 Edition of LP South India. Absolutely no comparison between the two!!  The older book was sooooooo much better than this new edition.  Granted, India is not one of the easier ones. We ended up using the older book most of the time and only using the newer book part of the time.  Mainly because LP has changed their format from the familiar structure we have grown accustomed to over so many years.  Not nearly as detailed in many ways - lots of errors and wrong information, restaurant info not nearly as accurate and detailed, and most importantly, the maps were simply terrible.  Different printing and not near as much detail.  We pretty much relied on all the maps in the older book. Also, the printing is not as dark as previous books, probably to cut cost so as to add new colored highlighting instead of the traditional black bold highlighting used for so many years. The new format has a different feel, more like a Fodors or some of the other guidebooks.  Simply not like it used to be. Why change a format that has universally been regarded as one of the best for so many years? I have to say, this was the worst LP guidebook we have ever purchased - bad enough that I'm questioning if LP is in financial trouble. We will purchase a guidebook for Russia very soon.  I will for sure look at Rough Guide instead of LP before making a purchase.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I already had a couple and these are in all my family packs.  Light, small and quick and they work well and you can do serations.  great produvts
0446573027|4.0|An edge of your seat thriller read in one sitting, from go to whoa, that had plenty of twists and was highly engaging. Some of Baldacci's stories are anything but believable, but on this occasion he gets almost full marks for 'Zero Day'. It was an entertaining, action packed story and yet it left you a little sad, but with plenty of optimism at the end because \\"you can't kill what you can't see comin' \\", right? A real page turner with a consistent story line.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This really does work! I haven't finished it yet but I have seen great results! Perfect for women that don't have the time to go to the gym for a couple of hours. This gets it all done in 30 min or less!
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|Puzzle after puzzle!  This game makes you think, but isn't so overly hard that you just want to quit!  Ton of fun :-)
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Good graphics, fun to interact with the animal. Probably could move a little faster but I guess that is what keeps you intrigued,
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Who ever cancelled this series back in the day should be shot. It is my favorite. I think all the cast fits perfectly and the movie ending makes me cry every time.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|It's an original idea for a game. My 8 year old son loves it.  I do too. This last sentence is to meet Amazon's minimum word requirement.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Yes, I am an Indiana Jones fan. Yes, I've bought every friggin release of these movies in every format (VHS, LD, DVD). So of course I had to buy this Blu-Ray release. I don't have any regrets in buying it again. The details in sound and video are stunning and are worthy of the HD treatment. If you're a fan of the movies, and don't have it on blu-ray, buy it. The quality of the movies themselves have been debated to death and the last one (Crystal Skull) arguably is the worst one in the bunch.  As a long time Indy fan, I would like to see Indy in the Fedora hat one last time. This time, in a movie that is comparable to the great Raiders of Lost Ark.  Come one Lucas, Spielberg & Ford...make it happen.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Can't stop playing this game!!!!!  I only wish you could earn larger amounts of tokens instead of buying them. So much for &quot;free&quot;. Hadn't kept me from playing tho!
B00AB55BS0|5.0|Rarely does a TV series or movie match the greatness of the book.  The Game of Thrones TV Series is the exception. Great acting, great casting, set and scenery match well with details in the book series. The one advantage that the Game of Thrones TV Series has over the books is that the plots are more streamlined and move faster than in the books. Certain details are left out but do not impact the story in a negative way. All of it looks fantastic in the Blu-ray format by the way.  The only minor criticism I have is that I wish there was a separate disk with all of extra features and not scattered over all of the disks.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fun game and so far no issues with it. As much fun as all the other running games. Must have to keep yourself occupied during those boring moments.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|what a cool game. keeps you thinking. its challenging and rewarding<br />I definitely reccomend playing this game! its great! show all or your friends and family
B005LAII4E|5.0|I love this movie!!!! All the action sequences, the story line. the ninja's and Road Block. The addition of the Rock as this character was really a good choice. Too bad they killed off Duke. They could have kept him for the sequel. This movie was fun. Watch without prejudice. =). I hope for a Scarlet comeback in the sequel as well as Siena Miller.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|I enjoyed the game a lot.  The increased difficulty of the match 3 settings just taught me more about how to succeed in making matches.  The little people rebuilding the tree were kind of cute.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I tinkle its cool. because its not like temple run it has more details.my cousins love it and play it almost every day
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|fun challenging fun fun fun you should get it like tots awesome good game get it now now now now cool
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|4x4 racing in 2D. A good source of entertaining when your bored or have nothing better to do. Many vehicles, many tracks, and many upgrades.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|Just buy it, put it in your DVD player, turn off the lights, turn up the volume, zone out and tune in. Rinse and repeat. Life is good!
1451696191|5.0|This book was really good! So well written and really touching. I also recommend the movie as well. I think many teens could relate to this book.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I downloaded this game on my kindle fire HD and on my phone and this app won't work for me. WHY DO U HATE ME APP!!!!!!!????!??????!!
B00C061I3K|5.0|It is a very soft and mellow sound, but I don't think you need anyone to tell you what it sounds like. You've probably listened to it somewhere else before and know why you're buying it. Why are you reading this?
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome! I never get bored and i love how it brings you to different city's. I also love how you will soon be able to get outfits!! Its free so if i were you i would get it!!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I personally think that the rooms are a bit challenging, but not that difficult. Also I had to get help on some of the rooms, but other than that, it's perfectly fine. Can't wait for more levels!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think it is really fun. A little tricky a little cool and so much fun! Also beware of elmacho!
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|This is an ever evolving game with puzzle after puzzle.  Keeps my interest where others have continually failed.  Challenging without being impossible. A+ all the way!!!
B009DCOU9S|2.0|A little to wordy. To much interaction between characters.  More directions needed in some tasks. A bit long winded at times.  Still having fun / playing .
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|THIS APP IS GREAT I THINK YOU SHOULD REALLY DOWNLOAD IT.  THIS IS ALSO  A FUN GAME BECAUSE IT IS FREE!!!!!
B009QU9X44|5.0|I now want to read her other books. I loved her distinctions between American Blacks and Black Americans.  It reminded me of the phrase &#34; If you are because of where you come from, you should get out more often&#34;
B008VBYN80|1.0|This game isn't really free. Once you go in game, you have to buy stuff or you're notreallygoingtobe able to do anything. Don't waste your time.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|just won't play for me. i try and try to get it to play, it just won't.  it's too frustrating for me to figure out why, so i don't play it.  remember you asked for my opinion and you got.
B00ANVX6DY|5.0|48mins, that is long move for young baby.<br />My baby only 23 months, She love it. She watch 3 times a day.Thanks
006114665X|4.0|This book is a moderately detailed account of the attitudes, policies, and actions that led inexorably to World War I. There is a fair amount of discussion, not often seen, of the Serbian precipitating events and their background, and this was very enlightening. The main players: the Germans, Austro-Hungarians, Serbians, Russians, French, and British are each analyzed in fair detail. The writing is clear and shows little bias on the the part of the author. The level is pitched to a target above the casual reader but well below the professional historian. My main quibble, and it is indeed minor, is that the title implies that the war came about almost accidentally, as a result of inadvertent or coincidental actions of the principal actors; the content of the book shows the opposite. In fact the governments of the time recognized the inevitability of eventual war and prepared.
B005HJ6MRO|4.0|I've moved most of my kids' movies onto the WD hard drive so they can play it from their Kindles individually, and without risking them scratching the original disks.  (It also keeps the tv free.)  I can verify that it works just fine on the 1st and 2nd gen Kindle Fires, as well as both HD versions.  I have not been successful in playing my local cloud when I'm not at home, but that might have been the hotel wifi settings, our firewall settings, or simply low bandwidth.  No matter, we're usually using it only at home.<br /><br />The one star off is for the minor glitch that a lot of people seem to have lots of problems with -- the white screen.  To fix it, just make sure your screen is not locked, so that it can freely rotate.  Then, rotate your screen.  It will clear right up. This problem doesn't happen on every Fire, or even every time.  But just rotate the screen and you're back to your movie selections.<br /><br />Overall, a great app for playing movies.  I also have the WD drive playing from my PS3.
B0064MT1U8|5.0|I own very few films.  I've found that those that have music or are romantic are most suited for repeated viewing.  This is one such movie.<br /><br />OK, so I'm also in love with Gwyneth Paltrow (her mother too!) and listening to her recite Shakespeare is a real pleasure for me.<br /><br />But, it's not just Gwyneth that gets me to watch this film every year.  This movie is very funny and clever.  The acting is top notch--even by the supporting actors.  The writing and directing are superb.  Heck, some of it was written by the master himself!<br /><br />At the end of the movie, I always get the urge to read \\"A Twelfth Night\\" because I want to find out what happens to Viola.  So much to read.  So little time...<br /><br />Apparently, there are those who don't like this movie.  I have no idea why.  It's a mystery!  ;-)
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This is an awesome book! It's perfect for all ages! It is my new favorite book, I couldn't put it down!
B009DCOU9S|5.0|I did not expect much to this game after reading some of the reviews.  I will have to say that I was more than pleased.  It is not just a hidden object game but includes some puzzles as well.  The storyline is intriguing and adds to the mystery that the player needs to solve.  It is worth playing this game!
0670858048|5.0|Great tool to help people understand the importance of the &#34;big picture&#34; & making sure one has all the info before forming an opinion.
B003XJDT1W|5.0|It is a great CD if you like country music. Bought this CD after I listened to Uncaged. Great songs.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My Grandchildren and I play this game quite often on my Kindle Fire. Fun strategy game for most ages. Many levels to play.
B00DHHWXYY|4.0|For those who know nothing about The Great Gatsby - never read the book or seen previous screen versions of it - count your blessings for you'll be able to soak all of this up without being bothered by whether it's faithful to Scott Fitzgerald's literary masterpiece or whether it's better or worse than previous attempts at bringing it to the big screen. You will, almost certainly, be knocked out by its fantastic sets, its clever plot and its superb love story because as a stand-alone experience, free of any preconceptions, it's an exciting, gripping and deeply moving movie.<br /><br />For the less fortunate - those who have expectations of what a screen version of this novel should be - things are much more difficult. For, while this is fundamentally the same story that Fitzgerald wrote it's not what he wrote - key parts of it have been missed out, much of what's been kept in has been exaggerated, and quite a lot of it simply isn't in the book. It's not The Great Gatsby as you want or hoped it would be and much gnashing of teeth will almost certainly follow as you witness scene after scene being twisted or, worse still, added-in for dramatic effect.<br /><br />In rock music terms what it is is a big production \\"cover version\\" and, in the end, that's how it should be judged because it's quite clear right from the opening scenes - a sequence that isn't mentioned or referred to anywhere in the book - that Baz Luhrmann has no intention of producing a faithful interpretation of it. What he wants to do is to take Fitzgerald's quite brilliant story and use it as the basis for a fast & furious cinematic \\"work-out\\" - a huge spectacle, full of CGI graphics, vast sets, swathes of exciting, technically complex audio-visual virtuosity and, on the way, a great deal of genuine drama.<br /><br />It is in fact The Great Gatsby on steroids - a pumped-up and distorted version of the original - and the really annoying thing for aficionados of this 20th Century classic is that it works,at times quite brilliantly, because like all good cover versions the essence of the original has been retained and then extended out into something that's exhilaratingly different. Just don't expect it to be what it's not.
B0000634EV|5.0|For me, one of the best things about this album is that I can put it on random in my work van and hear amazing songs in 20 or 30 minute bursts for 2 or 3 weeks at a time.  Its a perfect 'any-time' album.<br /><br />Another great thing is programming the CD to play the heavy songs or the mellow songs,<br /><br /> the heavy songs are 'strait-Up' Down... haha,<br /><br />1. Lysergik Funeral Procession<br />2. There's Something On My Side<br />3. Man That Follows Hell<br />5. Ghosts Along The Mississippi<br />7. Beautifully Depressed<br />10. New Orleans Is A Dying Whore<br />11. The Seed<br />14. Dog Tired<br /><br /> and the mellow songs are all vastly different from each other,<br /><br />4. Stained Glass Cross<br />6. Learn From This Mistake<br />8. Where I'm Going<br />9. Doobinterlude<br />12. Lies, I Don't Know What They Say But<br />13. Flambeaux's Jamming With St. Augustine<br />15. Landing On The Mountains Of Meggido<br /><br /> See how thats a 50/50 mix!?  this album is *Perfect, and that *rules because this is an extremely varied album when all mixed up.<br /><br /> There's something here for everyone.  My personal favourites are #2. Something On My Side - which combines all the elements explored on this album into a 5 minute masterpiece - and #8 Where I'm Going - for the \\"Charlie Manson's eyyyes!\\" vocal. Go, Phil!<br /><br /> True, its not 'NoLa' and thats great - its a totally different collection of songs that are of equal quality and value.  I commend this band for delivering us another astounding album.  I still play 'NoLa' a lot and I still play this one a lot.<br /><br /> Obviously, being from London and now living in New Zealand I can't comment on things being 'southern-fried' or 'swampy-sounding' and we certainly don't get too many 'hot humid summer evenings' but, judging by some of the reviews here if I was to do a south USA road trip... I would bring this!<br /><br /> 5 stars.  Righteous.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this app is so cute! but I wish the had more activities. the horses are so adorable. I still think they should add some things to it.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|First time I read a book from Picoult, was recommended by a friend. Will probably read more books from that author! Story could have happened anywhere.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|After waiting on the next installation of the Crossfire series...I was delighted.<br />I enjoy the subject and the writers style. Captivating and enthralling...
0399226907|5.0|My 22 month old son loves this book.  He can pretty much read it to us now.  We love it!  It's a must.
B00E0OK2X2|5.0|it looks like a good game,looking at the video provided it seems like it will give a good amount of tum to the buyer though I haven't bought it yet
B006ZB3V2C|3.0|Well i love the idea of this app however i am running a moto electrfy and have horrible skippi g and force closes alot!!!<br />I even ena led the lb audio thing they said to and no change at all!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Suzanne Collins has created a relatable world with relatable characters that no writer can replicate. This book with give you a roller-coaster of emotions, you'll cry, feel anger, and maybe even smile or laugh. But most of all, this book touches your heart like no other. This trilogy is a must read for anyone. I believe you will never encounter a trilogy, or set of books that will stack up to these. Well done Suzanne Collins, and May The Odds Be Ever In Your Favor.
B008602KQI|5.0|Very good movie, follows the book closely. Good acting and was very good graphically. I was entertained the entire time, very emotionally involving!
B009LDCZDC|2.0|First, the good: 2 stars for Mandy Patinkin and F. Murray Abraham. I could watch a show only about their characters.<br /><br />Now, the bad. It's not just that the plot got convoluted and unbelievable, but that the fundamental concept changed. I liked the show about an analyst fighting her mental chaos to be brilliant, and how office politics defeated it. Season 2 turned her into an irrational player in a sloppy love story that somehow supersedes the dedication to national security that defined her in S1. It wasn't just disappointing ; it felt like betrayal. There's no way I'll watch S3.<br /><br />Some of the acting is hugely overrated. Everyone praises Lewis's accent, but the idea that a Southern, working class Marine would enunciate with such precision is ludicrous. He also gets cartoonish when intense emotions are required.<br /><br />Watch S1 and stop, except for the single episode with Saul and Abraham's character talk. Ignore the rest.
B005K17RU0|2.0|I don't like the new format. It's very bland and lacking in information. I assume all the info is still there somewhere, but I can't find it. All the weather icons look the same in black and white outline drawings, rather than the old color icons. I'm not sure what has been taken away, but i used to get a lot more use out of this app.
B00DGKQ5I2|5.0|I listened to it once and was disappointed. On the second listen I was amazed. Great play and these guys are the true shit if you haven't noticed that yet. It's nice to see a band that kills it over and over
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|My kids and I are thoroughly enjoying this game. It is a challenge but solvable. I would love to see more levels and similar games from this developer.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Nice to be able to check on the weather without having to go to the web.<br />Keep up the good work...
B008M87GJK|5.0|It is the best news app for Kindle. The varity of news coverage is excellent. I have had this app for about a year, I read it daily and I highly recommend it!
B000P0J0D8|5.0|Good acting with a lot of star power and a well written and directed movie.  Very interesting.  The one thing that is weak is the fight scene where the woman is beaten in a manner that would have killed ten women and still stays conscious.
B00280LYIM|5.0|It was the best book I have ever read :) I really recomend it. It has a lot of action I LOVE IT
B00CPLGFM4|5.0|I used this in a mini-itx HTPC build. I'm quite satisfied with the results. I managed to build a computer for little more than $200 because of the price point. I would recommend this if all you want out of a graphics card is hd video playback.<br /><br />That being said, I've also been able to run DotA 2 on low-medium settings without problems. I haven't used it extensively for gaming, but it has been manageable when I've tried it out.
B00DEG4Z1W|3.0|Held my eight year old's attention for a few days, but then she grew bored of it. Occasionally replays it. Not much replay value or challenge.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is a lot of fun. One of the best out there and its free. Just got the update and it adds more minion fun to the game.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|very cool . Gets your mind going. The only thing is once in awhile the app would freeze in the middle of the run. great for kids and very fun.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|very entertaining and action packed ... the story line could have been better but it's marvel movies these days have become very short sited. it's hard to replicate comic movies.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator app is great and very easy to use.  I like how you can review your history input. It is percect for anyone to use
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game for any age or gender. The themes are always changing with new challenges so it`s never boring and if you choose to purchase coins, they are very affordable.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Very well written. Keeps you guessing and creates anxiety. Frequent twists. Somewhat disappointed at the end. Would highly recommend this book since each reader will have their own conclusions.
B000059LGC|4.0|A group of people on a boat and someone ends up dead.  A detective sets about discovering the guilty party and concludes that nobody could have done it. Engaging tale.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|this is one of the best car driving apps probably ever made. I definetly recemend it. its also a great app for kids.
B00E193TM2|5.0|Another great album from 5fdp. These guys just keep getting better with every album. Cant wait for volume 2 to be released.
B0089LOG02|5.0|This book was so touching... I have never heard about orphan trains before, and it is insane how easy it was for just anyone to adopt a child back then. Orphans were used for farm labor and in business labor... In exchange for food and lodging. Like live-in-workers. Extremely young live-in-workers.<br /><br />Definitely worth reading.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|fun game to play. great movie and a game to match! whole family enjoys this. the characters are adorable and plain fun times.
B000093BDX|5.0|This is an awesome Beach Boys CD. My friends all liked it too. I would recommend this cd to anyone
B003E8P9G0|5.0|I was surprised at a lot of parts but all that I can say it was the greatest book in my thoughts
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This game is so worth it!!! The graphics and colors are so beautiful its good time waster and its fun!! Highly recommended.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Black black boa typing I'm a typing like a boss. Btw I just reviewed this for the gems. IAt first I thought this was stupid but it's pretty good.
B00DU74U74|5.0|In most cases, the book is always better than the movie, but I can honestly say that this movie was just as good as the book. Of course, there were a few things missing, but all the important stuff was there. I really liked it!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I read this on the recommendation from an online forum I participate in.  As it was fairly cheap, I didn't expect much.  However, don't let the price fool you.  It's well-written, well-thought out, and full of twists.  A different take on the post-apocalyptic world, with room for<br />many more stories after.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|As a long time Science Fiction Buff I found Wool both compelling and often  disturbing as the ideas started  to be prophetic on  some levels.  The foolishness of power, the ruthlessness of  those that think  they are the ones to  save humanity and  all the other  trappings of arrogance.  The book screams  out,  Think and be humble.<br /><br />Nolan Bushnell
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fun for all. This fast paced game that takes you through a few different stages with easy and challenging taskes
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfer. I enjoy all the various locations around the world. The game plays well and rarely freezes. When it does freeze, the issue resolves itself quickly.
B001GCUNWQ|4.0|Having brought this for a gift for someone, I did not get a chance to watch it!  I was told that it was excellent!  I am going to watch it, sooner or later......
B0064X7FVE|1.0|The old app was much better, I hardly use the new one and will properly delete it soon.  End of story.
B00E3IZIM0|2.0|I'm not sure if they gave free lobotomies before this movie and I just missed mine, but that's the only explanation I can give for where all of these 4 and 5 star reviews are coming from. This movie had to be conceived by a group of potheads having a discussion about if Optimus Prime could kick Godzilla's ass because that's the only way I could imagine that someone thought this was a good idea.<br /><br />Stoner one: \\"Dude, who would win in a fight? Optimus Prime or Godzilla?\\"<br />Stoner two: \\"I think Optimus could take Godzilla!\\"<br />Stoner three: \\"Whoa! That would be an awesome movie!\\"<br />Stoner two: \\"What else could the movie be about?\\"<br />Stoner three: \\"Who cares? My sister is in 8th grade and can write a sweet script!\\"<br />Stoner one: \\"We're gonna be rich, dudes! Let's order pizza!\\"<br /><br />I guess it's all about quantity and not quality anymore because people seem to like mindless junk anymore instead of anything with real substance. Save your money and wait for this one to be available as a free streaming movie on one of those nights where you have so little to do that even clipping your toenails sounds fun. Even if it takes years for this to be a free streaming movie it'll be worth the wait to not have to pay for it.
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|It was pretty cheesy, but it was a G.I. Joe movie and it had pretty good action in it. I would recommend it, if you are into these kinds of movies
B00ADR2DTG|5.0|My bedroom studio can't issue a lot of noise to the neighbors, so it's 90% headphones. I purchased some KRK cans but in reading about them, knew they are not only close to a flat reference, but also need more juice as they are inefficient. Most of the headphone amps I found were USB computer powered (or battery powered), and solid state.<br /><br />Am not using a computer, rather a set of drum boxes, a keyboard, guitars and mics into a ZOOM R24 hard disc recorder. I wanted an AC-powered amp (who wants to worry about rechargable batteries losing their mojo?), and loved the idea of a tube. I have 5 other tube pathways including a Demeter Tube Direct Box and four channels of tube amp/compressor/eq's - you can't have enough!<br /><br />For the money this little amp just blows me away. The only complaint I even read about beforehand was that it goes so loud, you could bust your ears (kind of like the lady who burned herself on McDonald's coffee)! Buyer beware!<br /><br />Plus it looks cool with the tube glowing blue and the red power light. Normally I use the pair of RCA inputs from my monitor outs, but I can temporarily input other sources into the mini-stereo jack, which ducks the RCA jacks. Versatile.<br /><br />You'd have to spend a lot more money to get a better solution, in my mostly-analog world.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is the best game I ever played better than subway surfer but not better then temple run 2
B0079R8KXG|4.0|I wanted a red cover for my Kindle Fire and found out that there isn't alot or red to choose from. I did decide on this one though and I am happy with it. The back of the cover is smooth and looks plasticky and the front cover with the textured design adds a nice touch to its looks. When I opened the package I noticed a plastic odor, but it did not last long. The inside has a microfiber/felt like feel and I believe it protects my Kindle screen. The clips that hold the Kindle Fire in place hold up well; I'll admit that I was skeptical so I put the Kindle over my bed and shook it upside down..the Kindle did not budge. Two of the clips go over the speakers but there are holes in them so the speakers are not completely covered. I don't notice a muffled sound when I play games. The Kindle holder is loose on one side but that makes it easier to stand up when you fold the cover back. Whether I have the Kindle standing up like the picture or folded down flatter as if I was going to type, it stays in place. There is an elastic band that keeps the cover closed; that comes in handy to hold my stylus. I am happy with my purchase...so, if you are asking why I only give it four stars if I am so happy with it - it is because of the back cover. I think it would look better if the back was partially textured like the front.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I love this game! It's very addictive for me and the kids! I'd like to see more levels, and medallions
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I actually bought this movie for my mother-in-law. She told me how great the movie was, and we watched it together. She was right. It's a touching tale, and made me pet my pets the whole time I was watching it!

1400032717|1.0|It has no meaning to the book. It just about a dog being dead. I would not reccomend reading this book. It was terrible!

B005544V6A|5.0|Initially, I did not watch the program until season 2. I like the plot lines and Gabriel's swagger, he makes the suits look very nice. Particularly, I enjoy shows that reflect how corporations operate in the background. The parts that clients do not see.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|Dan Brown does it well, A+! Noetic science is the future - forget organized religion (which is all about the almighty dollar).
B002HNA95E|4.0|Just picked this up.  I had the Immaculate collection but I like the repertoire mix of this better.  It's less chronological for one thing and succeeds in integrating the sometimes overrated, sometimes underrated, but always sophisticated and eminently listenable music of Madonna.<br /><br />I lost interest when Confessions on a Dance Floor was released, so this is timely for those who lost touch at that point.  It's oddly comforting to listen to Madonna's studio music.  As much as she's tried to be a provocateur in recent times, and maintain her iconic status - her music still endures on its own 30 years after she started.  All the trends and statements have become irrelevant to me and the woman's affectations can grate on you, but the music still clicks.  Which is nice.<br /><br />I'm thinking of a beanbag right now and enjoying the aural landscape.  There is an experience and journey within this collection...<br /><br />Madonna - and those you worked with - we salute you.
B006FO3ERQ|3.0|No likable characters.  The story seemed  to be cut in half, though it was well written.  Worth reading, but became a chore to finish.
140006922X|1.0|This author has no academic understanding of Old or New Testament scripture.  His conclusions are for the consumption of those who want to digest &#34;pop culture&#34;.  He is not a serious researcher, he's in it for the money.<br />The fact that he teaches creative writing says all you need to know.  This is complete fiction from cover to cover.

B0094BB4TW|2.0|I have been using this app since I got my Kindle.  It was fine.  I had most of the functionally of my lap top.  The ads are not intrusive.  Perfect. Then suddenly I can't post to friends walls, the pages aren't rendering properly, click thrus lock the pages and I can't back up.  I switched to mobile view &amp; the icons for notifications, etc., are IN the middle of posts.  I've deleted &amp; reinstalled the app and no change.  Now every time I access it asks if I want to buy the full version.  Frankly, I don't trust it.  Fix the problems, please, and I'll think about it.
B003ZSI7R2|5.0|This was a gift for my Dad, and I was able to surprise him with something he had never heard before, so that was really cool.  We both really liked it, it has a great sound that mixes old and new.
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|There's so much to love about this film I hardly know where to start. First, it's based on the Frank Miller graphic novel by the same name, and having read said GN, I can confirm that the film follows the GN very closely! This is definitely a fan film, made by Batman fans FOR Batman fans.<br /><br />By Part 2, the Mutant gang has been dealt with already, so the action in this second half revolves around the battle with Superman (ordered by President Ronald Reagan). Batman has cleaned up crime in Gotham, and the local officials have failed to apprehend him so the president steps in and sends Superman. (If you recall from Part 1, the president had passed the buck to the governor regarding dealing with Batman--but this time he takes action himself).<br /><br />The voice acting was superb again, but I was disappointed that the voice of batman changed. Peter Weller's deep bass was a potent thing in the first part. While the voice actor does a good job in Part 2, it just isn't near enough to Weller and is a bit of a distraction until you get used to the change.<br /><br />The animation is top notch! The production overall is extremely well done with gorgeous visuals and outstanding music and sound effects.

075669910X|5.0|My son wanted this book for his 6th birthday. He looks through it constantly and every night he picks out a page for us to read together. It's inspired him to dig for fossils all around our yard. My little paleontologist.
B0002ZXCY4|5.0|Wow, this album and Ayreon as a whole are just incredible. It's extremely well produced and crafted together. I can't understand how I made it this far as a metal fan without even hearing of Ayreon. If you're thinking about getting this album, just do it, you won't be disappointed.

B00COGY2P2|5.0|Non stop action Movie reminiscent of classic 80s or 90s movies.  Will probably watch again! This rating system is foolish and frustrating!
B00C8985DU|5.0|..a bit pricy than the previous Deluxe Editions of his Archive collection, but this had more too. The extra CD shows that Wings did not have to 'clean up the sound' that much when mixing the album.
B008BQ8VOC|4.0|I found Suits to be funny, sometimes hilarious.  Altho not a thriller type of show it think  there's suspense in what's about to happen.<br />I love the romantic tension between the young fake Harvard grad and his hands off love of his life legal aide who he's not supposed to touch.<br />The female senior managing partner's character is a bit too overdone with her sitting on every desk and/or table to assert her authority is a bit too seductive/suggestive in flaunting her legs.
B00CRVZRUS|5.0|The clarity and sound on the blu-ray is excellent for this movie. I was a little disappointed that the booklet was torn.
B00CQGU9GG|5.0|A nicely packaged and compact set of their first 10 albums. Original recordings are excellent. Artwork is on cardboard sleeves.

B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|Was a good game scary as hell like it should be and as close to the original as possible and really cheap as well. Best mobile clone for this device
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Addictive game.  A little slow in earning resources but still enjoyable over the long term. Another fun game by Gameloft.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|What a great book.  Full of surprises, twists and turns. Finished in no time because I couldn't put it down. Can't wait to start the next book.
B00AFROVQC|4.0|Very descriptive.  Pulls you in right away. I was glad to see this is only Book #1, can't wait for the rest
0670026603|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! The subject matter is very deep and controversial but the story was told in a very honest and heartbreaking way that was very thought provoking. To balance out the deep subject matter, it was loaded with lots of burst-out-laughing humor along the way. I simply could not put it down. I highly reccommend this book but with a warning, don't read it in public because I promise...you will sob.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Although my daughter is better than me at this game, it is fun and easy to lose track of time playing.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Love the sealed set up and campaign mode. Super fun as a free app and made me want to buy the full game
B007FIY3VW|1.0|Purchased specifically to edit an Excel spreadsheet created in Office. Simply impossible to use for me, and this is what I do for a living. There's no way in the world my technophobe wife will be able to use it. It's crap. If there's a way to cancel the order and delete the product, I would have. Given that I'm stuck with it, I have to choice but figure out something, but this was a profound waste of time and money. I have ThinkFree Office on my Android phone and, except for the small size, it worked fine. If it was available in the Amazon store, I didn't find it.

B002KQ6BT6|2.0|This is certainly one of his least interesting works. Many of the trite plot techniques he has used before. Quite predictable.

B002G1YPH0|3.0|The  cooler is great,  but you'll have to disassemble your PC in order to get the backplate on the underside of your MB.  If you are building a new PC I'd recommend it 100%.

B009MYARIK|5.0|This was the perfect laugh out loud chic lit adventure.  I haven't read any Sophie Kinsella in some time and thoroughly enjoyed this one.  If you are looking for a very fun, mindless adventure, go ahead and get it.
B000HC2LI0|4.0|The extra material was great for seasons 1 thru 4, with several commentaries from Sorkin and Schlamme, but this material was essentially absent for seasons 5 thru 7.  There are several bonus material things, but for 7 seasons of material I don't think they included enough to make it a real selling point.  I rated this highly because I love the show and I also got a good price on it while it was on special.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|The world that is described is amazingly real. It captures a great deal of human nature, the great and horrendous things that we are capable of. And the way that the stroy/facts are presented and how are they related to each other, is captivating.
B0042U94UQ|3.0|Overall this is a middle of the pack movie.  It would be very entertaining for small children and I suspect they would watch it over and over but as an adult the story line leaves something to be desired, hence the three star rating.  The Minion characters are very entertaining and the three little girls are truly heart warming.  The same cannot be said for the other characters in the movie, some of which are just plain silly.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I usually see Facebook on my laptop, but it is really great on the Kindle too! I was surprised at the clarity and ease to use it on the Kindle. It is great! Recommend to everyone!
B00AWJYJVA|5.0|Superior to most of his post Cold War novels, this is a thoroughly satisfying story. , couldn't put the book down. Hope there's a sequel.

B007A4SDCG|5.0|This is truly a surprise filled with insights. Yes, Pressfield has a kick butt attitude but a lot of creative wannabes need that. I was particularly struck by his comment that if you're not using your gifts then you are denying the universe of the benefits of the fruits of your labor. Also, his comments that one should create for God reminded me that Van Gogh always said he was painting for God. I believe that nearly everyone will take away something beneficial from this book.  Money well spent. I will reread it often.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game was so cute and fun at the same time , I'm addicted to this game . Plus signing in with Facebook is more fun because you get to battle your friends . A nd it's adorable because I always thought the minions were adorable ^_^

B00BH0VSM6|5.0|I had read the entire previous Hole series and loved every one of them. For some reason the first two books where not available in English at that time. Now the first and second Hole books are out. The Bat is taken place in Australia and a fascinating story. It's definitely a page turner. Enjoyed it very much. Looking forward to reading and completing the  Harry Hole series  with The Redeemer.
B0058RCVYS|5.0|The story develops slowly and then it hits you right between the eyes.  Mikkelsen is his usual gruff self but does show a more sympathetic side later in the film.  Very well done on the part of all the actors in the major roles.  Kept me guessing as to how it would end.  Very enjoyable.

B00C0233A0|4.0|Multiple formats, watched blue ray, which works well, no problems.  Nice product, decent price for all of the options.  Recommended.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I'm a fan of apocalyptic literature. While this book was good it became repetitive when it kept relating various individual's stories of 'how I escaped the zombies'. There was little opportunity to come to care about individual characters. The only exceptions to this was the USAF pilot who crashed in Louisiana and the little girl whose politically liberal family fled north into Canada to escape the zombies only to have to resort to cannibalism to survive. Irony, I suppose. Typically, the author injects his likely views on international relations, military strategy and tactics, and human behavior when survival is at stake. Still, I think the book is well done enough to merit a read.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|great game for young girls and just girls in genaral. I think it is just a good game for all. good game
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Really great love story I'm just in love with nicks way of writing its so compassionate and describes relationships perfectly
B004NELBPC|5.0|I read several news sources each day. Huffington Post is the best by far. Clearly my favorite and I read it several times a day.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I truly love this app. Its perfect for time killing. It just keeps crashing, then I have to reinstall it to use again. gets very frustrating! follow me @agusiiia123
B002EMESSM|4.0|Lots of metal guitar riffs date the film, and long sweeping space vistas that are really milked for all they're worth (and then some). Still, it's like night and day between the original series and this movie. Clearly they managed a huge budget jump. Still pretty impressive, in my opinion.
B005544TRQ|4.0|I like the premise of this story about a law firm. Mike, who is brilliant, is hired on his abilities and talents. He has to pretend he is a Harvard law grad to be an junior associate in the firm. He and Harvey make a perfect team in that they compliment each other's weaknesses = a strong twosome. Harvey knows the letter of the law; Mike knows the spirit of the law.
B000SGRONM|2.0|The author has imagined many unfortunate events that are related to Christmas.  It was meant to be funny but most of the events are not laughable.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this it is my favorite kindle game.  I love how the setting changes every month. Some of the characters are strange but there are plenty of good ones that you can unlock too. This game is addicting.
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|Starting with the cover with Tina Fey surrounded by hairy masculine arms, the author writes about her humorous experiences at SNL and other shows. I would have liked it better if she had included more about her husband and family.
B005544TRQ|5.0|The language is pretty bad, but it ropes you in. Entertaining to say the least. And it's still on the air.
B0002VFXFE|3.0|I bought this mostly on the reputation that Arctic Silver 5 has, because I was trying a bunch of different thermal compounds to see what gave me the best results. Long story short, this stuff is fine but:<br />1) It needs time to cure before it reaches ideal performance<br />2) Even after curing, it does not outperform Noctua's NT-H1 compound which has no cure time<br /><br />I reapplied both the AS5 and the NT-H1 and tested a couple times over a period of 3 months, and repeatedly found that the NT-H1 performed better for me, with no cure time, than the AS5.<br /><br />So it's not bad, per-se, but I found it pretty disappointing. I recommend Noctua's compound instead.<br /><br />I tested on the following system:<br />ASRock Z68 Extreme7 Gen3 mobo<br />Intel Core i7-2600k @ 4.8 GHz @ 1.41V<br />Noctua NH-D14 heatsink<br /><br />Average max load temp was 76C with the AS5 (after 1 month cure time), 75C with the NH-T1 (no cure time)
B00BSBUZT6|3.0|I don't know how I like it haven't had a chance to watch it. But because I totally like the Eagles music I am sure it will be a big hit.
B00008O89K|5.0|Awesome arrangement and quality reproduction. Exact tracks that were in the film. Even if you don't like the movie, the music is fantastic.
B004N6369Y|4.0|Very light reading with mostly happy events.  Enjoyable, and as always with her books, I couldn't put it down. Quick reading.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is kinds like SubWay Suffers, but it has a different twist and is way better than any game I have ever played. It is so addicting and it constantly changes.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's awesome i can't stop playing it! The graphics are so realistic and the cool outfits for the characters are outstandingly amazing!
B00CF34B2I|4.0|I have played both offline and council version of Magic, and have to say that this edition of it isn't that bad. It can be a bit slow at times but it makes for it in the area of detail and information of what is happening. There is nothing worse than when something happens and you have no explanation of why, this app eliminates that question.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|I'm honestly sick Amazon reviews requiring us through do 20 words. All that I want to say is that this is a good album and anyone should buy it so buy it now.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I have Temple Run and Subway Surfer and love them both but this game is me favorite.  You enter your DOB and it adjust difficulty  to suit your age.  The layout keeps changing so it doesn't get boring and I love the Minions.  It will keep you engaged because something is changing all the time.  Recommended for all the Temple Run/Subway Surfer fans out there!
B0091REZMW|5.0|I like the tutorial and find the game easy to follow. Haven't paid for anything yet, don't intend to. Will wait for the time if needed.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|The Chromecast installed easily and the Netflix account could be set up, although it certainly was not easy to get the discount coupon and have it honored.<br /><br />The only problem is that the system does not work!<br />I have a high speed internet system (and am a scientist who knows what that means and measures its bandwidth).<br />I tried to watch a Netflix movie, (episode 1 of House of Cards). I saw good video (but not better than that)<br />with just acceptable audio (the words were hard to make out because the sound was so reverberant and bass emphasized) but THE PICTURE STOPPED ABOUT EVERY 30 SECONDS and took about 2 MINUTES TO RELOAD before showing again for something like another 30 seonds!!<br /><br />In other words the system did not work.<br /><br />By the way Netflix showed the movie on the computer was just fine.<br /><br />SHAME ON GOOGLE!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Really fun game.  Makes you think.  Only complaint not good instructions on how to play.  Really has my kids thinking.
B0018SRV3W|3.0|Very slow...told in a methodic style.  You wander where things are going, but they eventually get there.  I liked some aspects of this, especially the middle latitude scenes reminiscent of how things probably were in the not too distant past.  Acting wasn't great, just a few moments with pretty cool graphics.  If you can make it through the first half, you'll be all right the rest of the way.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great show. Just relaxing to watch great actors and a great script with a great set.  Can't wait for the next season.
B00DP3IESY|4.0|I don't always like Tom Cruise, but he did very well in this one.  Good mix of action and a little drama of course, a little cliché towards the end but it didn't mess things up too much.  Some of the scenes would have really been great at an IMAX, didn't get to see it there though...not sure I would have wanted to pony up the bucks either.  I do have a decent 3d set, that makes it worth a second look (first time was 2d).
030789701X|4.0|Excellent guide from Prima!. But i missed an art section.<br />Also its too many information!<br />The overall quality its good! Recommended!
B00BHMF578|5.0|If you missed this event when it happened, here's the back story in amazing detail.  Exciting true adventure not to be missed.  You can also read the book from which the screen play is taken..
B00CFA225Y|5.0|I was really surprised with this movie! i have no expections at all and now is one of 2013  best!<br />The overall quality of this release is great! Good A/V presentation and and good bonus features.<br />Also very nice 3d!<br />Highly recommended!
B008602KQI|5.0|I had not read the book.  Personally, I feared that it would be too graphic and disturbing.  BUT my curiosity got the best of me and I watched the movie version.  The concept is very riveting.  Once you start watching, you HAVE to watch to the end.  Now I am awaiting the release of the second movie in the series in the fall (2013) to see what happens next.
076790592X|5.0|Read this book in a couple of days and passed it on to my friend who had lost her brother that she loved dearly.  She also read it in a couple of days and returned it with gratitude.  Parts of the book were quote at a funeral that my daughter had attended and she told me about it.  It proved to be a very good guideline on how to live a good life and prepare for the afterlife.<br /><br />Morrie was a very good and interesting man searching for love and affection from others that had been denied him in his youth because of the passing of his mother and an unaffectionate Russian father.<br /><br />I would suggest this book to others that would like to improve their life and be prepared for death.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|It has been many years since I have followed a TV series. I stopped watching ER when Mark died and never followed a series since.<br /><br />I have a life-long love of fairy tales and found the premises of this show to be interesting. I am now hooked. The actors picked to play each of the characters has been perfect. The villains do waffle between being wicked and then wanting to repent. But, it would be necessary to continue on with the series stories. I don't mind the blending of various fairy tales either. In fact, I find it clever. I'm looking forward to Season 3.
B008602KQI|1.0|I did not watch it, it started out too violent for me so I turned it off.  It was not my cup of tea.
1780387105|5.0|Great songbook, easy to understand and follow. This songbook really goes well with the Beginner's Guitar Course booklet and CDs.
0307944689|2.0|\\"Full-length simulated TOEFL iBT with accompanying audio sections on an MP3 CD \\". it says the book has a audio CD, but I found no CD. The description is misleading.
B0091WNK8M|4.0|Somehow I've managed to live in Oregon for the last 20+ years yet still never watched this move which is as much a part of Oregon as the rain.  Definitely worth seeing at least once before you die.<br /><br />Whew!  I just got it in under the wire!
B007MU85D0|5.0|Every song on this album is worth listening to again.  And again.  I never skip past Of Monsters And Men on shuffle.  Go buy it.<br /><br />Individually, this album has at least six songs that I can't get enough of... Mountain Sound (yes!), Little Talks (woah...), Dirty Paws (not sure what you're about, but you're great), Your Bones, From Finner, King and Lionheart... Nanna and Raggie have a harmony that simply has no equal in music today.
B008B1VYP0|5.0|Sorry, but I love Adam Levine.  I'd follow him to the ends of the earth and back again just to hear him sing.
B000FC10IO|5.0|Love this trilogy. He writes such strong, inspiring characters with enough flaws and doubts to make them realistic. But above all, just a fantastic story teller. This was a re-read and I still got so wrapped up in the story.
B004P1JEWU|5.0|This is an excellent read, way above the common or garden Fantasy Fiction novels.  It is part of an extended masterpiece which has not yet been finished.  It has also been produced as a Television series, with superb results.  This is an absolute masterpiece, worthy of inclusion in the &#34;Classics&#34; of literature.  It is a gripping tale, which creates a whole world with values, history, geography and politics, not to mention a military arena that can only be fabricated and given form within the human imagination.  Cannot wait for the conclusion of this incredibly good read.
B000P2A256|5.0|This is one hot group still putting out music that rocks.  I love Maroon 5 and their music.  I think they appeal to many ages.<br />I'm 66.
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|you will play for hours and hours and never get bored with this game.  great grafics and my kids ask like this game.
B000GFLAI0|5.0|One of the best Dylan albums and he is a great writer and took me many years to fully appreciate his music and style.<br />Now I can't get enough.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Interesting connection between the two World War II adversaries. Much of the book was devoted to the German pilot which was new territory for me.
B000050HTO|5.0|Still discovering songs I never knew and this has many of the songs we have listened to and loved  Recommend this to all Dylan fans
B0031R5K68|4.0|Another Dan Brown's book following the foot steps of the Davinci code and Angels& Demons. I like all additional information around symbols, US capitol's history as well as all information around Masonary. It was easy to read and you get quickly into it.<br />People who are very religious might find it offensive in their own way but it is another point of view and it's a book to think about.
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|It takes alot of pratice and can require some real money. But he loves iron man so much so he play, plays!
B0083P1QUM|3.0|This is a nice summer read. If you know Patricia Cornwell, you are familiar with her writing style. I do find it sometimes a little bit annoying that it takes a while for the story to pick up and most of the times the books comes together at the very end and it is too fast. But this book is a nice summer read and the story is interesting.
B0026SCMNM|5.0|This is an awesome read whether you grew up in Brooklyn or not. For those of you who did grow up in Brooklyn this is a definite must read. It transports you back in time to when immigrants first came to Brooklyn. I am not one to read a book again after I finished it, but this book is definitely worth another read. In fact, I lent the book to a friend and never got it back, so I purchased another copy.
B00E193TM2|5.0|Every song is great on this album! Love it can't wait for volume 2 comes out I bet going to kick ass too.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I loved the relationship between the dog and Logan.  I love the depth that is portrayed in him too.  Author's dont always reach that depth to it's true potential, but Nicholas Sparks did a good enough job here.  The movie is all sorts of mixed up compared to the book, but both are great anyway. &#60;3 this book.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is very fun it has almost every thing from the movie.it was hard deffetting vector and menna.  I love it
B000OVLBFS|5.0|Liked the interaction between Tom Selleck and the other characters in all the Jesse Stone movies.  Also liked &#34;his&#34; dog and the way he reacted to Jesse and vice versa.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|The first two books were so much better.  This one was all over the place.  A lot of different stories with the other characters but no conclusions to any of it.  Then, it just ends abruptly.  Really disappointed.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Good show. I enjoy the storyline but maybe too much disappointment for one season. We shall see in season 4.
B00066FBQG|5.0|This movie is one of my all time favorites. The cast is perfect for the story; Paul Newman and Robert Redford play off each other so wonderfully and with the help of William Goldmans clever writing that his movie rightfully earned its spot as an instant classic!
B008K6HN8I|5.0|OMG...this app made it so easy to find files.  I had transferred a Power Point from my laptop to my Kindle Fire HD and couldn't even find it until I downloaded this app.  If you download this first, it will make it easy to find files/folders.
061891868X|5.0|This book is wonderful because the author knows precisely what a layman might find interesting about theoretical physics, and from the start it's his goal to explain real discoveries and the power of theory in a way that is easy to grasp. You will learn why the LHC is really important to physicists and why the Higgs boson is overhyped. The book was written before the LHC was turned on but I was able to intuitively grasp that the Higgs boson was not an exciting experimental discovery for physics, which was very gratifying. Smolin is a real science writer among the best, like Hawking or Stephen Jay Gould. The complex concepts involved might make it a slow read, but it is gripping from the start and not only makes a strong case against string theory but helps you understand the standard model, particle physics in general, and even why science works at all. It made me wonder what the reaction to this book was in the scientific community because it lays out the flaws of the string theory world so precisely. I wonder whether it has had a notable impact 7 years on.
140006922X|5.0|great book,good references given in back pages of his book. I enjoy it. People need to stop watching fox news they gave the Author Reza Aslan a grilling interview just because of his religion.
0785153942|3.0|Was expecting, or, needed something more from this comic, the drawing was not that great, and the story didn't gave that much of a thrill or knowledge about the pacific rim franchise.
B002DJSBMA|4.0|This movie is unlike all others. It is a different perspective on life and how death is stronger than all of us. Great acting by all cast members!  Very entertaining.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I loved this app! Probably the best one I ever had! I loved it because you can write notes, change them to whatever color they let you decide from and if you want that note to be private, you can put a lock on it and have a password. Really awesome app and I am so happy I have it. It is pretty much like a diary to me. One thing though, I forgot my Kindle Fire password one day and I had to reset it but when I installed the app again all my data on it was gone which really sucked :/
B008MEM24S|5.0|Can't stop playing. Doesn't need wifi to run which is a plus while I'm driving in the middle of nowhere with the kids:) Definitely recommend!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|DEEP, amazing, what a great book, I will admit that I cried. Beautifully written story! I just love this book.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|It is extreamly hard for me to find a book that I enjoy and I LOVE this book! I am deffenently going to get the rest of them.
B006FE83UE|5.0|This is the most popular book to be read in high school these days.Everyone should read it and then view this movie. Just wonderful and so inspiring.
B005GSVFAK|5.0|I'm a fan. Love them all. In 3-D in my own living room. Perfection! Really. Does not get much better than this.
B0064J6OMO|4.0|really funny. Like both actors. This story line has been done before so it was just ok.. Good date night movie
B008RKIACK|5.0|I've seen this move a couple of dozen times. It never gets old. In context back when it was made, it was a statement of the time reflecting the fears we had in the fledgling years of gang violence. In context of today it's almost wishful thinking for the fantasy it represents. The acting is not the best. Michael Beck never had the breakout to major stardom some people wanted for him. Still, there are some excellent moments, great choreography with visionary story-telling.
B00632HWOG|5.0|A very cool app for previewing, deleting, or writing emails on your kindle. It is much better than the browser. Perfect for just reading and deleting while on vacation!
B00003CXBH|5.0|Beautiful scenery and music. Shows the terrible things done in the name of religion and politics, but also shows the sacrifices man can make when led by a love of God and fellow man in order to share his compassion with the world.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|I don't normally like these type of movies but this was a little scary, funny and entertaining rolled into one....
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|I like superhero flicks, but after two hours of over the top special effects, I'm ready for reality. Good use of humor. Robert Downy got the best one liners.
B000FC12Z0|5.0|it was a great book. very good if you like mystery. I look forward to reading another novel by Agatha christie
0425266060|5.0|I loved it now going through withdrawal. Were is the next book  to many questions need to be answer. I can't wait.
B00DYTKKGI|5.0|I gave this to my kids and they loved it you will really want it my kids are telling me they wanted a to be a doctor
1433502410|5.0|My son is taking this bible back to college this semester and plans to use it as a tool to lead a small bible study group.
B00C0W08XK|5.0|I have been enjoying Sudoku for years since I'm a numbers person. So glad I can now play it on my Kindle Fire. It's lots of fun and super addicting. I love how I can choose the level of difficulty. I did find it odd that I had to choose the square and  then the number but not a major deal!!
B00E8B1P9M|4.0|This was a great movie, I gave it four stars because of the loading issues otherwise it was a great movie once I was able to watch the whole thing. I took advantage of the whole 48 hour rental. I think I just might buy it, then again I am a HUGE &#34;Rock&#34; fan.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The most addictive yet most enjoyable game ever. Fast paced and unlimited lives keep me on my toes. Whether I have just a few minutes or a whole hour to share with these delightful minions,  I love it.
B0000AC8LR|4.0|I just watched this movie for the second time with my mother, we wanted to watch something original. I agree with my husband that there aren't many good films out there like there used to be. Donnie Darko, has it all, a great 80's feel with great cinematography, great acting, dialog, and story line. Were his meds. making Darko hallucinate it all? Was he a Super Hero? Was there divine intervention? Any of those questions and any other questions is left up to the viewer to decide. I like some of the 'irony' in the film, for instance the movie theatre featuring The Last Temptation of Christ and The Evil Dead. Overall I think it's worth watching however the end of the movie makes me feel a tad empty, it reminds me of It's a Wonderful Life, only with the opposite results. I wonder if that's a good message to send? It does put a damper on the film for me but I can't bypass the other great attributes the picture has to offer, hence the 4 star rating.
B0060V1WJ6|4.0|Steve Carell and the rest of the cast play well off of each other in this quest to rebuild the romance when a long married couple break up. Lots of characters and threads woven about into a sweet, funny little film.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|Just restructuring it. Like the back lit button a lot  Francesca dark .  Super easy crop &amp; save. Backlit photo to nice frontlit without messing w contrast or brightness, nice feature.
B00DHNBPA6|4.0|Well made, semi-intelligent approach to the old classic. I still have to question how anybody could stay at the places these types of films depict...but then I guess there wouldn't be a movie...lol!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I like To play Temple Run so this like that game. You have more fun with this game, than Temple Run 1.
B00DU73T08|1.0|Don't waste your money. It's an awful movie. Poor acting. Nothing like the book. Couldn't  even get through the whole movie
B00DYMM76Q|5.0|Pure country music.Vince  does a great job.I think it's some of his best work.A lot better then today's so called country.
B00BQPEIT2|3.0|I love this app but after awhile it gets boring and all u want to do is win . So fun and boring!!!!!
1781162646|4.0|Not Stephen King's best by any measure, in my opinion, but his mark is all over this book so its definitely worth the read.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This was a great book,just like his others and I will buy any book he puts out cause I know I won't be disappointed.
1468179993|3.0|Nothing earth-shaking in this for me. All basics and common sense. Love the premise of the book but it just didn't deliver the goods.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Wonderful book, as good as Kite Runner. Filled with many characters interwoven over time and space. Sometimes you can start a chapter and not know who it is about for a couple of pages. Beautifully crafted tale, rich with emotion. Best book I have read in a long time
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Really love the artful design and the many informative items relating to battery usage for various apps and cellphone states. Love the Calibration speed, and the audio cues for battery levels. Well worrh the $3 91.
B0061S0A64|5.0|a great app that lets you create and save musical tones and beats very clean/well made tons of options to tweak with a lot of fun
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Was a fine weather app but after update is more of a stupid survey site.  I don't want to earn points for crap I just want the weather.  Deleted it, looking for a new weather app now.
B004F706LW|5.0|I'm not a big music fan. But I've heard Tick of the Clock on many commercials. And I like the way that song makes me feel. So I wanted to pick up the album. Not being able to get the song via digital download and wanting to support the band, I opted to pick up the deluxe edition on CD. I am very satisfied with the artists and merchants. Thanks for great music and a great experience.
B005K17RU0|5.0|One of the best weather apps I've used. A one stop shop with everything you need. Current conditions, forcasts for daily, weekly and extened. Radar and video weather also.
B00AFEX83C|5.0|This Pixar movie was well done. An instant classic that plays over and over in my house. I love the characters. Boo is my daughters favorite. So cute.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Why would you watch Avatar without 3D? Great movie; blue ray and 3D made it fantastic! Saw it in the movie theatre but now I can enjoy it at home.
B00AEFZ8OY|5.0|If you like South Park then this movie is for you! Its been out awhile but never gets old! Highly recommend.<br />AMERICA, F YEAH!<br />Enjoy!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|There was nothing sensational or interesting in this story. A typical &#34;B&#34; pulp fiction type story.<br />I was very disappointed.
0451191153|5.0|THE FOUNTAINHEAD is the best of Ayn Rand's novels. WE THE LIVING is a close second. I know most readers are inclined to give that nod to ATLAS SHRUGGED, however I respectfully disagree. Yes, Rand delivers a powerful dose of philosophy in this novel with Howark Roark being the ultimate embodiment of that. In FOUNTAINHEAD, you see the characters actually living it very believably. Dominque made sense in her conflicts. Gail Wynand, the powerful publisher, comes to grips with how he lived his life. Peter Keating, the ultimate second hander, believably sets up the novel's climax by not keeping his word to Roark. Ellsworth Toohey made the consummate villain of the tale. Which set up the most memorable lines from the book: \\"Tell me what you think of me!\\" \\"But I DON'T think of you.\\"<br /><br />To me that is the difference. All the characters in FOUNTAINHEAD are believable. The philosophy is presented here by Rand in a way most can easily understand. The reader may not agree but they will not be scratching their heads or feel like they are being lectured to. There are some parts of ATLAS SHRUGGED where one may well feel that way.<br /><br />I first read this novel in 1981 and have read it a couple times since. It is a classic work and I find value in the philosophy presented. Back in the 1980s I was part of an Objectivist discussion group and the scene called \\"The Rape of Dominique\\" was often a point of discussion. It is a scene worth reflecting on but I will say that, back then, people were evenly split on whether or not this reflected a consensual scene or not and, to some, it was a crack in Roark's principles.<br /><br />A word of caution: while the book is great, the movie isn't. My brother described the movie as being akin to guerrilla theatre, and I am inclined to agree.<br /><br />Read the book, it is worth it.
0385341008|4.0|I was very happy I did finish reading the book because I love historical novels and it did have a great story to tell! History can be boring and that is why I enjoy the novels more.  Enjoy folks- there is a true meaning and some history.
B003G4W49C|4.0|The book drew me in very much. Some of the explanations were confusing and I couldn't picture what Orson Scott was trying to show me. But I loved it, not a fan of it being with children only because children now are no where near that smart so it took a while to accept that they weren't even teenagers through the whole book. Can't wait to read them all!
B00280LYIM|5.0|The reason I rated this book 5 stars is because... I don't even know why this book is just too good. I recommend this book to people that like fictional stories and Greek Mythology.
1451695195|5.0|This book was a referred must read and I am so glad I did.  Personally for me it brought an overwhelming feeling of confirmation and comfort that our Creator continually speaks to us through so many avenues.
B001ER4CNY|5.0|This was a very funny show with a great cast, they don't make them like this anymore.<br />Classic TV at it's best, and Barbara Eden was so good looking.
B0038W0OIK|2.0|The soundcard produced a buzzing sound since day one(not useable) but I didn't care because I had a better sound card.<br /><br />Headphones were great for 13 months until the right headphone randomly stopped working. I have been extremely careful with these headphones so I really don't know why it stopped working. I switched the bridge sides around(first time I've ever taken this apart) and it produced sound for about 2 minutes before once again failing in the right ear phone)<br /><br />There website requires you to sign up to use their customer service. I cannot create an account on their website for some reason... *update* It wont allow me to on Firefox, but on IE I can.<br /><br />This is the second Steelseries headset I've purchased, the first being the 5h(cant remember if it was 5hv1 or v2). They have had great sound for gaming but neither have lasted past 18 months. If my problem with these isn't resolved it will be my last steelseries purchase ever.<br /><br />*update* Just got done with my 3 week long support ticket where I told them the issue. They will not fix or replace them because of their 12 month warranty(24 month warranty in Europe). If you plan on buying these headphones just know that they will not last longer than a year. I guess I should feel lucky that I got 13 months out of these headphones, as clearly they are a pile of shit.<br /><br />Also since this is my second pair of steelseries headphones and neither have lasted longer than a year and a half I would highly recommend staying away from steelseries as they don't make long lasting products NOR do they back their products.
B001M7JXD0|5.0|OK. I watched Lost.  All of it.  Stupid, but it is very enjoyable soap opera TV. The first episode of the first season of this show is excellent. Unlike Lost (or much better shows like The Wire or Deadwood), there is no narrative arc.  Each episode is self-contained. It's like the X-Files remade for people who never saw the X-files only with worse, less attractive actors and terrible CGI.  (I never saw that show as I disliked it.  Even Gillian Anderson couldn't make me watch it.) And the music of Fringe is directly ripped off from Lost starting with the third episode.  The dialogue and acting are very much boilerplate TV \\"drama.\\"  By chance, my wife and I watched Wallender (Bc remake) after giving up on this show and were amazed at how much better TV Wallender is.  We also saw Braquo (both seasons) but didn't like it as much.  (The second season of Wallender sucks, but the first is great and the third is good.)
B000FBJF7I|5.0|This book was a fun, easy read.  I enjoyed the main character so much.  I thought the story line flowed easily.  This is a book I would recommend for a fun summer read.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Have this game for a while now and my whole family loves the game.  So glad that we finally got the El Macho level. Can't wait to try and beat my kids now with the new level.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|World War Z, was a fun summer read.  It's easy to get through.  I read it and my grandson read it.  We both enjoyed it very much and then went to see the movie.
B008QE9XD2|5.0|Had not seen but missed in theater.  Bought cause Depp & Burton fan.  Never saw original series.  Was very enjoyable
B0064X7FVE|3.0|Well it is not to bad of a program. It's a battery hog and likes to run in the background a lot. Usually responsive but not always.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|If and when they get the kinks out, I could give 5 stars, BUT... there are problems with the \\"snooze\\" feature. And being a lazy guy, that is a feature I use. First, if you hit the snooze button, and then change your mind and decide to get up or return to your day, it seems impossible to shut the alarm off until it sounds again; only then can the snooze feature be shut down. In other words, it's going to go off, even if you've changed your mind.<br /><br />Second issue - one that conveniently, or inconveniently, annuls the First - For the past several mornings, hitting the snooze button seems to have turned off the alarm itself. For instance, this morning I set the alarm for 8:00 AM. As is my habit, I hit the snooze button on the first ring, and so the alarm did indeed sound again @ 8:10; as is also my habit, I once again hit the snooze button @ 8:10 (with plans on actually getting up at 8:20).<br /><br />BUT the alarm never resounded, and so I slept till 10:00+ AM.<br />Thus \\"My Alarm Clock\\" sort of works, BUT then again, it sort of doesn't.<br />It's okay for a backup, I suppose, but not the real thing.<br />I will buy the real thing today.<br /><br />-----------------<br /><br />2 October. I must add that I have changed my review to five stars as they have fixed all the problems I mentioned above. A very useful little app.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|It is a beautiful story!  Very well written.  He has a gift of transporting us to this far away country.  I really enjoy his books, and the people he writes about.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|This was a fun game other than all the talking. The graphics were really good and I love the kindle fire
B006LSZECO|4.0|It was hard to put down.  Very fast moving and a very odd story line. I was not prepared to like it.  Very weird charaters!!
B00881VLCE|3.0|Great entertainment and fun. Nice pictures. Wish it made puzzles of your own photos. Besides that it's a good app
B007URVZJ6|5.0|A simple step by step &#34;How to&#34; guide that answered all my questions.<br />I look forward to publishing to Kindle.
B0025KVLV0|5.0|just like I remember, those song's will never get old.to bad they did.so I guess just let it be,and them too
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I found this an interesting read. It's hard to imagine how the mind works to protect us from memories that might be harmful or too painful. Also, it showed how much friends and therapy helps.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I started and couldn't stop. Original and intense. Similar to the first time I read the first Hunger Games book, because it is so captivating.
B007TNS6JI|1.0|Downloaded 50times and still will not  let me play it glad to the home screen every time at the same spot
B0061S0A64|5.0|Create neat beats. And fun just to mess around with it. The beats you can create are relaxing and entertaining!
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Ok so I thought this looked fun. Well, it would if it could ACTUALLY LET ME PLAY!!  }:( It doesn't crash, mess up my Kindle, it just doesn't load. It might work for some people, but not for me. I do not recommend this.
B00B2LRK7W|5.0|Hard hitting and true to life versus make this a great album. If you are thinking of buying it, go ahead, you wont regret it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is actually fun, you run ans you can upgrade and that's one of the best parts in my opinion. Now I'm save up everything to get a special character and board so I have a high score. Honestly this game is really fun and I think you will like it because it's like temple just without the tilting.
B00E193TM2|5.0|This release is well worth the wait. The band shows both accoustic and the heavy metal they are known for. Many guests spots on this album and the sheer raw gut bass drops make you want to listen to this over and over again. Five Finger Death Punch really have out done themselves on this one. This is one album every knucklehead cannot miss.
B00BV1P8NG|4.0|i know nothing about it but hey i guess it made the kids happy. so it works for me. =)
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Overall a good book. Not one of the greatest I've read. A bit redundant.  It does get you hooked. Worth the money.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|One of my favorite apps. works great on my kindle fire, everything you could want in an online shopping app!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I could not put this book down. Very exciting and crosses several genres. I liked the way in which it dealt with not only zombies, but also with the realities of the post zombie world.
B005NFWCSK|5.0|Wish this movie could have been longer lol!! Hopefully everyone else that watches this movie feels the same !! I give it a 4 out of 5
B009FZHYKU|5.0|There have been some great television shows over the last 60 years. I Love Lucy, Cheers, Seinfeld, Six Feet Under, Sopranos, etc. Walking Dead, however, for me anyway, represents that absolute best series that has ever aired on television. Regardless of genre.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|but still I anticipate the 6th one when it comes out.<br />I miss not being able to be with those strange people and think about them some days.<br />Actually ,  it had some very interesting parts but some chapters dragged,  thus the 4 stars.
B005QBBCMI|5.0|Very sad, but so very good.  Makes me appreciate my life.  Nicholas Cage was fantastic.  Elizabeth Shue was awesome.  What happened to her?  She was amazing.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|The author demonstrates his knowledge of medical terms and poly-syllabic words. A bit hard to follow but, I suppose that is the nature of the topic.
B00DJZ06DO|2.0|This edition is ONLY in Japanese, with english subs.  Not usually picky about video quality, but this seems slightly bootleg.  Considering asking for a refund, or something.  This is really strange.  Out of the box, just seems not quality.  3rd party manufacture perhaps?
B005MW5CWW|5.0|A great mixture of metal. This album takes you on a journey and doesn't disappoint. I saw these guys at the mayhem festival and they were by far the best band.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|challenges your mind. if u like mysteries, this is a good game for u. just try it really! ok i am done with this review.....
B00AFROVQC|2.0|Having read all 6 books available in this series (largely because I abhor not finishing a book once I start and realistically these should be a single book) I can honestly day that the author should stick to writing books for young adults. The plot was inconsistent, juvenile and repetitive with most sections or chapters beginning with a character having a dream which 'felt so real' and predicted the plot for the remainder of the chapter. Further to this there were numerous quality issues with typos and on a couple of occasions the wrong character name was used (this got much worse in the 6th book almost as though the author was rushing to get it finished).<br /><br />As I have said, the books really should have been combined into 1 or, at worst, into a maximum of 3 and a much more dynamic and enticing plot is needed to capture and keep any adult audience. Any comparison to George R.R. Martin is utterly and completely misplaced.<br /><br />Morgan: if you are reading this then the phrase is 'couldn't care less' and not 'could care less'.
B007G51UV0|3.0|The motherboard is installed. It replaced a P8Z68 that failed after two years. This is a wait and see situation.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|Same as the movie.  I had seen it, so I bought it.  Not sure what else there is to say.
B0011E7JBW|5.0|This is such a great oldish movie.  So light and cute.  Love the little aliens and I appreciate space theme movies (I work for NASA).  Glad I bought it.  Watching it with my kids was great.  It's much better than MIB 2 and 3.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Great show! Our daughter sent to her Dad for Father's Day and we had to order the 2nd season before we were done watching the first one. Can't wait for the 3rd.
B00BF11STU|5.0|Loved the movie.  It did a good job of conveying how much our military (and other govt. agencies) does for our freedom.
B0041KKYDI|5.0|Great story and acting job by Franco. I would recommend getting this one. I'm surprised he has not been in more feature films.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|Very slow and confusing on how to get back to home page.  Other than that it's not bad. ** *
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very cool game! My kid loves it! Challenging but not too difficult. She's. 7. Cant wait for updates. Works great on my Kindle Fire!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Omg so awsome but needs more characters i love it so awsome game needs better graphics and better weapons and better battles
B005LAII4E|3.0|Well, I watched it and found that the \\"Duke\\" character carried more of the last movie that I realized.  When they killed him off at the beginning of the movie, the movie got a little slow.  Don't get me wrong, like someone said, it was just plain fun, but 3 stars is the best I can do for it.
B00BD62X14|5.0|I wish the jacket contained translations of her songs.  She has a beautiful voice.  I'll buy more of her CDs.
B003BW0CB6|4.0|very good reading story, keeps you wanting to keep just keep ready. Michael Connelly is as always a very good writer.
044024630X|5.0|Still cannot believe they made a movie of one of Child's novels using Cruise as the part for protagonist Jack Reacher - who is described by the author as being a former MP, 6'4&#34; tall, solidly built at 240 lbs or so- respectfully, Cruise is like 5'6&#34; to 5'8&#34; and 175+ lbs soaking wet! I do not believe the author had any say in who they chose to play the part. Lee Child is a great author. If you are going to read his works, start w/ the first one and work your way up. It is worth it. Mr.Child cranks out some genuine page turners!
B0047Y17P2|4.0|as always Michael Connelly has written a good book you just want to keep reading and not put the book down.
B00BB22GQM|5.0|Established band with just enough mellowness to certain songs to get me to order the album. I love gazer/ chill wave/ sub pop, s/s'r indie bands and artists. These guys were excellent. If you are on twitter follow me @CU2MRO and I will follow back. Loads of quality indie artists on twitter!
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|This movie was a lot of fun, especially since I did not go into it with any expectations, nor had I read the book first.  It was recommended to me by someone with a very similar thought process as my own, so I had a feeling I'd be pleasantly challenged with a surprise!  I loved the film, but you really do have to watch it carefully; don't blink your eyes lest you miss something important!  he he  It is worth watching a 2nd time, because with each viewing I think one can take away even more than the first watch!  I truly recommend it.
B00D6GT5S8|5.0|Noisetrademusic sucked me in on a few freebie tunes that I liked, to the point, I just went on Amazon and bought the LP! If you are on twitter, follow me @CU2MRO and I will follow you back. Loads of indie bands on twitter too!
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I love all of the Jack Reacher books.  Some are better than others but these are worth reading, just to see a little more about where Reacher is going, what he is doing and how he continues to change even though he says NOT SO!
B00DHNBPA6|2.0|The movie is a class b horror movie at best.  Definitely a good movie to watch on the couch with a date!
140053271X|1.0|The pages turn slowly on this nook.  I was unable to download a library book on it.  A microsoft person tried for some time to download a library book without success.  I believe that this was not a new nook as advertised, but a used faulty nook.  I returned it and was given a refund.  I bought a new nook glowlight from Barnes and Noble and it works very well.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|This app is  more than just a place to jot down shopping lists. It is a wonderful place to collect information that is available across devices.
B004SIIBGU|2.0|My pet peeve is that when you download eBay to my KindleFire HD, PayPal should AUTOMATICALLY download too; there is an option to select PayPal to download, but it doesn't work!!! Moreover, the program is much more limited than is the net (www) version, via my Mac.<br />  :(
0143117009|4.0|Very heavy reading, not many people would pick this up anymore.  I found it very informational and interesting, wish every politician had to read books like this before taking office.
1582406723|5.0|Wanted to see if the books were like the tv show. So far it's a very good read. I would recommend it for the die hard Walking Dead fans!
B0036EH3TS|5.0|This movie is awesome ... loved it like the very first time.  Because it was done with film, you can see the film grain on HD. I actually love the grain on the movie ... it gives it a realistic look like if I was back in the theater.
B00884GR0W|5.0|when I got this game I was surprised at how amazing it was! The graphics are outstanding compared to minecraft. The animals are very realistic looking and so are the characters. You can have your own pet dragon, spider, cat or dog that follows you every where. The dragon and spider fight with you though. So basically you can dig for ores, discover the different places like hell, Atlantis or the sky worlds. There's also tons of creatures to discover, like dragons and megaladons too! I'm addicted to this game!!! :) You can build a house and have a farm. There's farm animals too. There's a plethora of things to do. There's also missions you can do for the characters like Ted, and Paula. When you complete a mission you can sometimes unlock a recipe to make a different type of sword or vehicle. This game keeps you occupied for hours at a time. I definatley recommend this game to those who like minecraft or building. :)
1451695195|4.0|I bought this book for a book study I'm in and read it in two days. Very interesting account of Dr. Alexander's experience in a coma, his history, and what has happened since he recovered. As a Christian, I already believe in heaven and don't feel I need proof, but his conclusions/interpretations give much for a person to think about.I gave it a 4 instead of 5 stars because I found some of the medical information way over my head; then again, he would feel it important as a neurosurgeon and to substantiate his experience to others in his field. I'm looking forward to our actual discussion of it in the fall.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Okay! This book was amazing! Soooo Many sweet and thoughtful parts in this book.  The author did a GREAT job writing this book, he kept me wanting to read this book.  It honestly only took me a day to read this book, it was that good.  Sad but thoughtful and loving parts!<br /><br />I loved Hazels character, most of the time I hate the girls character they are shallow and obnoxious, but Hazel was the opposite she was thoughtful and a strong character!<br />-Overall this book was more than okay? It was amazing an  worth every cent!<br />Read this book now!
B00AHJL7BK|2.0|Fun but buggy. I don't know what the pattern is but often coming back &quot;resume&quot; is grayed out even though I was in the middle of the game
0385349947|5.0|Still reading....Will be passing this along to my teenaged daughter....everything I've been telling her about life in the &#34;'girl'&#34; lane
B0019FOC5E|5.0|Saw the play and the movie many times. Loved them both. Thought Meryl Streep and the rest of the cast did a great job.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's a lot of fun. But has a slow response time sometimes. But other  then that the game is well put together. Very good game for small children.
159463176X|5.0|Have read all his books and enjoyed them very much. Waiting for his next one.  His books are very meaningful. There is a message in all of them.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|Its just like emoji pop! Except you have to use coins to figure something out! But that makes the game more fun!
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|I love this game it is fun to pass the time by fast.<br />I can't wait till I have the sniper.
B00178JDCK|5.0|I bought this pedal to enhance the reverb sound of my amp. It work very well. There are different settings for intensity and reverb sounds. Nice addition for the price. Uses a 9V battery or power supply.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|This game brings you into a virtual world of pets! From the cutest kitty to the best bunny it has cute pets matching real littlest pet shop toys. All it needs to be a five star game is a nicer pet to start it off. Other then that it is a cute game for five year old kids to 13 year old teens.
B009JBZH54|5.0|The packaging was good. All the disc's were In perfect condition and all these came at an awesome prize. I will be looking for more!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Again, wonderfully written and acted by a stellar cast.  Maggie Smith is perfection!  Get out the tissues for this one though!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I watched The Hunger Games movie last year and loved it so much I decided to read the 2nd book.It was just as action-packed as the hunger games with a very weird twist at the end that will leave you dying wondering what's going to happen next.
B006YTTVHO|4.0|I really liked the get to the point mentality of the book.  No fluff, just the facts.  I am not an introvert and have always been a social butterfly, but confirmation of some basic skills never hurt anyone.  I am having my son who is getting ready to go off to college read this.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Never a dull moment and full of suspense! I am sad that there is only one more book to read.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The Downton Abbey series is an excellent portrayal of the immense wealth and social stratification of Victorian England.  All people, but especially Americans, should watch this series to appreciate the opportunities America affords to anyone willing to work hard.  That said, I also think Amazon needs to clean up (read improve) their software and make it more user-friendly-- as in make it more like Netflix from where they snatched Downton Abbey on July 1.  There is no reason on earth why it should take so may steps, clicks, etc,. to get back to where you left off the day before.
1932100660|5.0|Campbell makes a very strong case for the plant based diet. I haven't read any other that supports its thesis as thoroughly with his own scientific research (as seen in peer reviewed journals) as well as with the research of others.

B0030IIYYS|5.0|My kids love this movie! It is a great product. I was so excited to be able to get this movie at such a good deal!
B00AIBZJS4|5.0|For somebody who loves Cirque du Soleil this is great! I really enjoyed it although it clearly lacks the excitement of a live performance.
0394800184|5.0|I love reading this to my children! I remember reading this book as a child!!! :) I was so glad I was able to find it!
B000W0B0G6|5.0|I think this is the best album Cat Stevens ever made.  It reflects his abilities as a singer/songwriter superbly.  This one album has many of his greatest hits that are well known, but some of the lesser known songs, such as &#34;Father and Son&#34; and &#34;Hard Headed Woman&#34; are particularly worth listening to.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|Great book!  I laughed and cried and loved on my dog!  Slow to start but finished great! Must read this book!
B00BI6SSMC|5.0|Iron & Wine have done a great job with this new album, which I highly recommend seeing live. The album reflects the groovy, up-beat style they have on stage.
B00B97SNJI|4.0|Anyone with tastes that include Jackson Browne, Warren Zevon, and that genre will love this CD. Thoughtful lyrics sometimes steeped in cynicism and good solid memorable melodies makes Dawes a welcome relief to a lot of contemporary artists and bands. &#34;Some People&#34; and &#34;Beneath the Surface&#34; are both favorites and borrow from the J. Browne tradition. A solid effort from a very capable and inspired band. Two more uptempo rockers and I would have given this five stars.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|It's a funny & clever show! Always enjoyable. Love the characters & actors. Lighthearted show about lawyers, not the norm.
B008Y76VW2|1.0|total b.s.  typical jewish re-imagining of what a stud the dorkus was &#34;back in the day&#34;. a waste of time.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|This is a great game to take with in road trips.  It i challenging game. We have never made it through the entire course. Just when you think you have it.... The marble falls.
B009EE0DO6|4.0|lots of nudity, several hot chicks........ the gay sex club scene kind of ruins it toward the end, but worth a watch.
B0063M22QO|5.0|This mahjong game is very impressive I enjoy classics and this game is very classic. I will play this game a lot. Download this game you won't regret it.
B00CL68BK2|1.0|.....making dysfunctional  co-dependency seem &#34;romantic&#34; and &#34;sweet&#34;.  Oh, if you're an emotional trainwreck, you just need to find someone else as screwed up as you are!!
B006TLFPKO|4.0|I have enjoyed this series. Each one gives you more insight and hooked that much more. I have started reading the books to see how close they are to the books.
0345529057|5.0|I was very happy with my order. It was a Great deal and I received it very quickly. I highly recommend this and not just because the books are amazing.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|Overall it was a good movie but like every movie they overcame the situation and saved the world inside a couple of days...
B005LHOKFS|5.0|What is there to say? Our whole family uses TripAdvisor for all of our trips, day trips and side trips and even meals out. We have found the reviews very helpful in deciding where to stay, where to eat and where to play! Out of the hundreds of times we have used this tool as a guide, I think I can honestly say I've only been disappointed one time and that was a Seafood Restaurant. We all know how some restaurants can be hit and miss. I use it often and have found the tips very much on the money for hotels, places for our family to play such as attractions, shows and even out of town donut and coffee shops. What's not to love about free? It has saved us a lot of money and wasted time by avoiding bad food, service and nightmare hotels. I can see our family using this tool for a long time!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I'm not sure the epilogue was god enough, but I love this book, I wish I didn't read it as fast a did, I finished it in 1 1/2 days.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I use this app to keep up with family friends and our grands most every day sometimes two times a day. I also use the messaging to keep up with business associates who may not have my email address. I haven't had the concerns other people have had.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have this app on every device I own,its amazing I love the different versions of the Bible it offers,some are for daily reading then others you might use for church passages discussions. I love that on the card ride home I can plug it to my car stereo and listen to certain versions. I admire the reading plans that remind you daily (if you choose it). The companies customer service is very prompt and helpful. I have my family hooked. if you were ever doubting getting this don't its Amazing and freed :) ENJOY
0670026638|5.0|I loved this book.  It was a book to pace as you did not want it to end.  I love the grandmother in the book and the whole concept of time any physics.  Best read this summer.
B00BXUG0KU|5.0|I like Chet Baker a lot as well as Eliane....a very pleasant recording, arrangements somewhat similar to Chet, but for me, it has a nice relaxed feel
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|I was loving this game played it all the time.. I guess you guys did an update now it won't go past the loading screen. I'm upset y try to fix something that isn't broke. Kindle Fire HD user..
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I keep telling myself one more level then I'll quit .... now it's midnight and I'm still playing. :) I would recommend this game to friends!
1105495957|4.0|The book was great but it was a little bit worn and its second hand nature was obvious.  I was however very pleased.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I just tried Pinterest App on my new Android and it works beautifully; I gave it 5 stars because it is Simple, Easy to manage, Fast, and I work with it just as I do in my laptop. I love it because I can pin from anywhere at any time without any problem. I can be in a doctors office waiting my turn, but I will not be bored because I have all the fun I want either pining, repining, commenting or sharing. Do I recommend it to others, YES I recommend to anyone interest in Pinterest.
B001TCNSOI|3.0|Excellent film ruined by this untalented and ugly bitch. A real shame and waste of great scenery and close ups.
B00CATSONE|3.0|This book's title was a little misleading to me.  I approached it from the point that the book was about Tesla and his amazing futuristic view of energy.  I was not ready for this to be more along the lines of a self help book on how geniuses approach items as opposed to others that do not share that same outlook.  The lessons in the book were well received though.  Tesla was obviously a great visionary and the way the author tied Tesla's brilliance to the reader in a way that simply says &#34;you too can&#34; was well done.<br />This book could be a very concise version of Tesla's biography with the added benefit of giving the reader the insight in to why Tesla did what he did and what drove him making his tests, victories, and defeats all the more powerful for it.
0812993845|5.0|I could not put this book down. I got it on 7 day loan from the library<br />And worried that I could never finish in time. I mean I have two kids.<br />I finished it in 3 days. Read the last 200 pages in one day. Couldn't<br />Wait to figure out how it ended. Very funny. I actually hope they make it<br />Into a movie! Highly recommended!!!!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game is awesome it a great way to pass time but hate the ads can Amazon get rid of ads without spending money? But other than that epic game:)
161655164X|5.0|Gives a great look into the concepts into a great game.  Definitely buy this is your a fan of the game.  Awesome book
B003MLFVGW|5.0|Okay, Who saw when the doctor was dying at the end of the last pandorica episode, when he went through his... Oops, Sorry River, Spoilers... Anyway look at the doctor when he talks to Amy before he leaves with river and octavian. Anyone Notice his Jacket?
1595825045|5.0|great look into one of my favorite tv series.  Highly recommend to anyone who likes the show.  Awesome, high quality book
B00A6RCSKC|1.0|Hurt in many ways I want my money back and my time for waiting on false hopes to play a great game
B00CDSIMI4|5.0|The thing I really like was that it was an actual jewel case, not the paper sleeve.  Great soundtrack from a great game.  Awesome
B0002KQNJU|5.0|Husband has always wanted to get this movie, but no luck!  But thanks to you guys, he is so happy now, and a few more people will be enjoying it soon too.  Thanks!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It's really fun! It has the same concept as temple run but I like the minions the only problem I have is you need face book to unlock some levels and that's why I gave it a four star. Other than that really fun for all ages!!!!!!!!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I have Google TV, a Vizio TV with apps, and a Panasonic Blu-ray player. All three devices are capable of streaming Netflix. The picture quality of the Chromecast is superior for me compared to the other devices. Why did I purchase the Chromecast? I purchased with 3 month Netflix deal making my cost minimal for a device I can take with me. Fortunately my three year old TV has a side HDMI port with USB outlets right next to it so my install is clean with no need to connect to the wall. The TV also had a firmware update to support CEC allowing the turn-on switch inputs feature to work.<br /><br />I have a fast network with a high-end desktop PC that is connected via a wired connection to the router. For me the quality of a picture streamed to the TV through the desktop browser is great. It is slightly behind the desktop but the picture has been rock solid from a variety of sites. Have not tried streaming from a lower end laptop or tablet so I can't comment on that.<br /><br />I have had a Roku box in the past. Highly recommend it. The channel choice is unsurpassed. If you have room for another box it is probably the best choice especially when compared to what third-party vendors charge for the Chromecast. AT 35 Chromecast is good value at 100 it is way overpriced compared to the Roku at 78 plus cable for a 1080p streamer. Do not pay anything more than than retail. When I ordered from Google they said it would ship in 2-3 weeks. It shipped in two days though the journey took a week from when it was shipped until it arrived.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|love the way the graphics are! my horse coco is adorable! thought i was gunna hate the game but it surprised me! great for being free too!!
B002R88G5E|5.0|I loved this book. Khaled is a wonderful storyteller.  I was sorry when I finished the book. You get attached to the persons in the story.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is amazing never played a game so fantastic as this one in my whole life. This game rocks.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|it's confusing now, and i dont like how its always in my notifications, and it wouldn't let me open it.
B0063M22QO|4.0|I haven't tried the timed modes yet, but the classic mode is just fine.  I like being able to play games like this in my living room while the rest of the family watches the telly.
B004M9ZI0M|4.0|It's well done but could have more energy. Everyone does their job and does it well but this is one of my favorite productions but not sure my favorite that I've seen. Helen Mirren is credible but the gender twist doesn't add anything. More for fans of the actors than of Shakespeare. But definitely worth watching and more than once.
B00DFRVAC2|5.0|I purchased the soundtrack after seeing the movie. The music really stand on its own. Love the various moods and levels of intensity. Cool tracks.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Bought this for our Kindle Fire 8.9. Husband and daughter love it as they are into racing games. Game works well and seems to go on and on.
B00BUADSMQ|3.0|Original Review:<br />Sorry, ten minutes into this movie and I was cleaning up my house instead of watching the movie.  (I let the movie continue to play for background noise, catching scenes here and there.)  It was just lacking something the other Die Hard movies had.  I absolutley LOVE the other 4 movies!  (Not to mention that I love John McClain's signature phrase!)  I have yet to sit down and watch it again.  It was just a bit on the boring side.  I heard a rumor that they are coming out with a sixth movie too, possible called &#34;Die Hardest&#34;.  Maybe they'll bring Holly back.  Might be nice to see John settle down with the wife that started it all at the Nakatomi Tower.<br /><br />Added a Year Later:<br />I have sat down and watched the whole movie now, without getting up to clean house.  I must say, this is the worst Die hard movie.  It was lacking.  Definitely did not live up to the Die Hard name.  I'll leave the 3 stars because although it was not good, it was not bad either.  The movie takes place in Europe, not on American soil.  John meets up with his son this time who wants nothing to do with his father (poor John).  I must say, I prefer the daughter in Live Free or Die Hard, she had an attitude and a mouth on her!  The son...just seems like he wants to be serious and get the job done, no love and no laughter.  And also, John's signature phrase (&#34;Yippee Kai Ah...&#34;) felt like it was thrown in at the last minute just to be sure it got into the movie.  So, to sum up, definitely not as good as the other 4, but so bad to make me want to burn it in the fire pit.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Bought this for our new Kindle Fire 8.9 and the entire family has been playing it. This version has the Red's Mighty Feathers update which is challenging at times. Worth the money for us. Now if we can just find the rest of those golden eggs....
B0067AC5KA|5.0|First read the three books individually--now rereading on my Kindle.  This is so convenient to have them in one location.
B00884GR0W|5.0|This is a very good game and it looks like you pay attention to reviews so here's a few ideas.<br /><br />1. Give a flat  land setting for creative<br /><br />2. You know how the T-rex in the game, you should make a portal to a land with dinos and some volcanoes and more sinks there<br /><br />3 Make a spaceship that can go to space with random generated  bid balls of space rock and aliens<br /><br />Well that's all for now bye!
B000RLHDUM|5.0|Simply entertaining.  It was a clever plot with nice twists.  And I love the implied commentary on the &#34;value&#34; of famous paintings.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is cool I hAve it on Xbox and now kindle it's awsome but there nobody online there is no ppl in realms that's sucks message me if u are in realms so we can play minecraft together the call me lava dude but it got erased so I'm called bloodslicer 23
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|The sounds in the background made me want to know more; bad ending though.<br />I wish I could have kept going I didn't like how I didn't get to find out the end. Can't wait for more rooms to come.
B00E25KVLW|5.0|A really good introduction into Rails 4. Lots of usable examples and very readable even if you have limited programming experience.  The books guides you from a noob in Rails to a beginner understanding the concepts and taking away the first annoyances to usually occur when studying new technologies.<br /><br />The thing I like best is that after finishing the book you can write basic applications and especially you're ready (motivated) for learning new things about Rails as it shows you clearly how powerful it is!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I loved this season among the other ones that have been released. I spent my whole day watching this show, it is that addicting! For people who love the 1920's time era, you will love this show! Even if you don't you'll still love this show. It will make you wanna laugh, cry, etc. I can't get enough of it!
B009UZBLSG|3.0|I have not gotten this device to work with my new Nexus 7 when using a LCD monitor with a DVI to HDMI cable adapter. IT WILL NOT WORK WITH ADAPTERS OR CABLE ADAPTERS, ONLY WITH TVs  with HDMI. Plugged my Nexus 7 into the slim port and HDMI cable directly to my TV with HDMI- Works PREFECTLY!!<br /><br />*Now the question posed: \\"Will it work with a LCD Computer monitor with HDMI Output?\\" Im sure it will, just older monitors with vga/dvi outputs will not, even if a adapter is used.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this story so much.  Team Peeta for sure!  After reading this, my daughter asked if we could read it together.  I look forward to re-reading it with her.  This is an excellent story.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|If you love Nicholas Sparks books you will love this one.  This story has a mystery aspect to it that you will not see coming unless you saw the movie first like I did.<br /><br />The only reason I gave it 4 starts instead of 5 was that I think he spent to much time on the situation that she was trying to get away from.  In the movie very little time was spent on this but you still got the point very effectively.  For this reason only I felt the movie was better than the book which is a rare occasion.
1400034779|4.0|I found this book lying in the street. As someone who leaves my own finished books in airports and supermarkets hoping a person who needs to read them will, whenever I come across an abandoned book, I treat it as destiny. This is the first in a series; each book concerns a case investigated and solved by the only female detective in Botswana. It's fast and entertaining enough to serve as airplane reading, but, unlike another airplane writer, John Grisham, these are peopled by fully-drawn characters, and the African setting adds a fresh layer of interest for most American readers.<br /><br />I'm so glad this book literally showed up like a gift--since the discovery I've gone on to read a dozen more books in the series. I don't know how this man writes so much so fast--he's got several other completely different series going as well--unless he's one of those writers who hires a team of ghosts. Whether he does or doesn't, I'm glad to have the books. Something about these stories cheers me up about life and people like nothing else.
0345803507|5.0|Cant wait to see if there will be more books by E.L. James.  I feel like Ana and Christian are real people.  Need more!
B006ZS4G24|5.0|just great,especially for girls who love horses,  goes so well with the heartlake stables, and olivias newborn foal, highly recommended
0812973992|5.0|The author weaves several tales into one fantastic book and I have ordered his most recent, &#34;Transatlantic.&#34; Looking forward to another excellent read.
B00CSR2J9I|2.0|Its a very nice game. It would be a little nicer if you could control the viechle a little more. This game is sooooo boring.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|It keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting to see what will happen next. I love this game!!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's kind of like subway surfers except way better and a lot more fun. Everyone should have this game. Subway surfers is like temple run.
B00CWVG1Z8|5.0|Everything felt really authentic in the movie, from the characters to the scenery.  I guess that I am the idiot who needs to read the book, because I was rooting for the two main characters to have their happily ever after.  It's a nice twist on the &#34;if you love someone you have to let them go&#34; saying.  I really want those two to be together, so will there be a sequel?
B007J4T2G8|4.0|When I started reading it sounded familiar, however, I never read this before,  Not what you would call a hard core SMBD book.  Mr. Grey was far to much into controlling, which I guess he lightened up in the end of the third book.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|This is a fresh approach to the classic story, with good acting and a deeper story line than I have seen in the past.  Emma is still very silly in her matchmaking attempts with her friend, but she matures by the end.  She is a delightful character, with many interesting characters in her little world of Highbury!
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|This is an interesting book.  The story is compelling for sure, but it seems maybe the teller is not completely believing the tale himself...  It is written very much like a newspaper article.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is lots of fun. I just wish you could play it with out an internet connection. I play whenever I can.
B00AEUU4LQ|5.0|Such a great read.  Clear your schedule for at least a few days so you can gobble this one up.  Grabs you in the first story and then different voices tell each smaller story to make up the whole.  Tip: do not miss the quote on page one!  Once the book is read, go back and re-read it.  Just loved this book!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a must have game. This also just got a new level. The price is right also.... free! Great for kids and adults.
B00DEG4Z1W|4.0|It's great if you want to do hair as a job but otherwise it's kind of slow! Still a great game so definitely download it!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Anticipated possible disappointment but far from disappointing. Did not expect the end until the last few pages. Very well written. Will recommend to my friends and look forward to reading more by Mr Land at
B00BH0VSM6|5.0|The mix of suspense, clever plot convolutions that keep you thinking the mystery is just about to be solved (until you realize you're only half way through the book), and well-sketched characters - Nesbo clearly has had a winning formula from the beginning!
B00AES0AZI|5.0|I have read many of Koontz books and I am yet to find another that can match Watchers. This book is definitely in my top three favorites of all time. I have read Watchers over TEN times and it is just as captivating every time as when I read it first. If you are a fan of authors such as John Grisham, Sidney Sheldon, Stephen King and Sandra Brown, then Watchers should be added to your reading list and I guarantee you it will stay there.
0143143492|5.0|Mr. Tolle has a real genius for making the age old truths understandable.  He is an asset to the world community. I've listened to this audio book hundreds of times and constantly am finding new understanding.<br /><br />I can't recommend it highly enough...there should be one in every house and for children a person to explain would be a great blessing to that child.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is amazing on kindle but a little glitchy on I phone just want them to add the book and quil
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Love this game and really glad its on kindle now i can play it when im out and about :-)
B00881VLCE|1.0|I loved the older version the new version is terrible I hate it.  The puzzle pieces are to small at 280 the 218 pieces was so much better. At 280 the puzzle does not fill the page and the white border is terrible.  The slide out for the exit tab is in the way.. When you drag the puzzle pieces to the puzzle the slide tab is in the way. I loved this app but you have screwed it up. How can I get the older version. This used to be fun.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I have never thought that I would get an experience of what it was like to take care of a horse.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|What are they thinking to lose precious Matthew, he was the best of the characters!  Unrealistic...too much death...Love the rest of the series!
B00CTSDDVO|4.0|Its worth watching but if you are the type that needs closure with everything must be correct? Don't bother, you will shoot your self in the ear.<br /><br />First off its exciting and breath taking moments of thrill for every leading characters. Moments of chaos and free-fall of fear to develop the team and understanding.<br /><br />Secondly its sentimental feeling of family and hope of the crew generates a great feeling.<br /><br />Third, Just kick back and enjoy the ride because its gonna knock your socks off!!!<br /><br />WATCH THE DANG MOVIE!!!<br /><br />P.S Stop it with the nude scene talk... In the TNG there were Naked weddings!!! I don't hear every one talking about that.<br /><br />side note - minus 1 star for the bad math but its a Bad Ass movie regardless.
1451673442|4.0|If you want a kick in the ass to get you motivated off your couch and chips, see this one.
1439127727|5.0|If you like history, you will love this book.  You will find out things never reported before, and be amazed.
B004BLDD9Y|5.0|The light is very natural, the replacement wattage as stated (50w) seems accurate (although it would be much more helpful to indicate lumens rather than wattage replaced), and the actual wattage (6w) is great for those places where you want to leave a light on 24/7.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|This game is so fun and totally addictive. I begin thinking that I will do one level and stop and then the next thing I know I have been playing for a while.
B0042J6VUS|1.0|When i first unboxed this tripod holder thing it already looked like junk but then when i tried to put my ipone in it.. it fell apart in my hands.. do NOT waste your money on this..
B008IJTFYW|3.0|The melodies are nice, but the application will not run in the background so you are unable to read and listen at the same time which was part of the reason that I wanted it.  It also drains the battery faster than most of my other apps.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I read this in 2 days, and I usually take much longer to savor a ook. This was very easy. This has been a book group pick by a few that I know.
B00DU74U74|1.0|Not much here except a time waster. The story sounds interesting and actually starts as a good sci-fi but it quickly goes nowhere. Boring, dull, immature.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Five stars for the creators of this game! Mysterious and fun, i do hope that they make another game soon! Especially as i would like to see if the player escapes.
B00DHNJCKQ|2.0|5 minutes of action, 20 minutes of snoozing, another 5 minutes of action, etc. I was very confused with some scenes in NYC and others in Philadelphia. Never did watch it to the end - unable to stay awake.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is the best, most addicting site ever. I love it. I think I may spend too much time on it however. Oops. :)
B004QOB8SO|5.0|Now I understand why people are obsessed with this show. Season two was phenomenal and I cannot wait for season 3
1490313370|5.0|The first part of the book was scintillating while the mid-section started moving more slowly and the last part reignited the burners. It's a page turner with one major stop sign for me. James is confused about the interrelationship of selling and negotiation as they do go hand in hand. He surrenders his truth about lacking intense sales experience when he discounts the necessity of a good salesperson needing to have complementary skills in negotiation.<br /><br />James writing style can be captivating while hold you in the barrel. Very Good writer and I would recommend the book!!!
0399159347|4.0|When I read Liane Moriarty's What Alice Forgot, it reminded me of Remember Me? by Sophie Kinsella but with a more serious bent. While initially Cecilia's character seemed a little out there like a more responsible version of Kinsella's heroines, The Husband's Secret is a darker book.<br /><br />Cecilia is one of those supermoms who successfully manages both a career and busy home and social life. She talks a lot but people mostly think well of her (or are jealous of her for being so on top of it all). Cecilia's inner monologue can be entertaining and sometimes heartbreaking. It definitely makes her a real and more likable character.<br /><br />Rachel is the secretary at the elementary school Cecilia's daughter attends. Rachel is still grieving the murder of her daughter Janie who died as a teen years ago. Now her son is moving his family to the U.S., taking Rachel's young grandson (and only source of comfort) away. Rachel is mired in grief and bitterness but I still felt sympathy for her because she seems to be so alone.<br /><br />Tess is dealing with the shock of finding out her husband and her cousin Felicity (who happens to be her best friend) are in love with each other though they claim \\"nothing has happened yet\\". This betrayal sends her back to Sydney where her path will cross with Cecilia and Rachel as well as her ex-boyfriend Connor Whitby. While I did feel bad for Tess because of her marriage situation, I didn't agree with some of her decisions and she came across as childish at times.<br /><br />I thought the characterization of the main characters was really well done. There aren't any easy answers and the author gives the reader the ability to empathize with the characters and to be able to see both sides of the story. Tess's story is perhaps the weakest because Will is off screen for much of the book but the other stories were well developed.<br /><br />I wanted to read this book partly because it involves secrets. I have to admit that I was way off base on what the secret would be and I'm glad. I liked how with all three story threads there is some closure and some things left open-ended like it is in real life. I think this book poses some tough questions to consider and I think it would be a great book for book groups to read and discuss.
B00CXN2JNS|4.0|1) Kingmaker- begins with a cool bass intro before kicking into a fast, meat and potatoes social commentary about greed. This is a light hearted song despite the speed. Dave is obviously not very angry here, but I imagine it would be hard to feign anger after going platinum several times over, being adored by millions of people worldwide, finding religion (despite what you may think about Christianity, he's very happy he's found God. It isn't our place to judge that decision), and conquering his addictions. This song grew on me quickly. I only wish the intro were LOUDER! Four stars easy, out of five!<br /><br />2) Supercollider-This song has some very angelic guitar tones, unintrusive bass guitar and a positive message. It's a \\"count your blessings song\\" with a distinct country feel. For some reason, it reminds me very much of Black Sabbaths' \\"Hard Road\\". I give this song four stars too!<br /><br />3) Burn- This song begins with a very '80's Megadeth guitar feel, then straight into a mid paced  narrative about Dave's struggle for success. This is his \\"Eye Of The Tiger\\". Despite some great guitar moments, I give this one a 3.5.<br /><br />4) Built For War- This is arguably the most angry song on the album featuring some truly great thrashy bits, a howl along moment, and very aggressive style. The song is essentially about kickin' ass! Definitely a shining moment on this album. Oh, Do you hear the bagpipes?I give it a 4.5.<br /><br />5) Off The Edge- This song is about Dave's struggle to understand our world gone mad. Structurally, this song reminds me a lot of \\"Public Enemy No. 1\\", however the SUPERIOR guitar solo sets it apart, as well as the insistent, desperate chorus. I give it a 4.<br /><br />6)Dance In The Rain- This song begins with a morose narrative about everyday life. This song features, yet again, some great guitar work (and Cello. And Violin. And vocal assist by David Draiman). Dave lets this song breathe a lot. The big surprise here is that about halfway through, for the first time on this album, Dave sounds very, very angry. The song speeds up and Dave is in full snarling beast mode. I give this song a 5.<br /><br />7) Beginning of Sorrow- This song sounds almost like an updated version of \\"In My Darkest Hour\\". Dave's low growl illustrates the sadness and frustration of having to choose between your baby or wife surviving, and illustrates what the baby's life winds up like without Mom. It begins with another cool bass intro before the whole band kicks in. The chorus is repeated a lot, but seldom interferes with the enjoyability of the song. Once again, great solo with some cool strings (hidden in the mix. A short, enjoyable song. 4.<br /><br />8)The Blackest Crow- This song begins with a cool, soulful country vibe complete with fiddle, before teasing us with a death march. At this point, Dave unleashes a country-metal narrative about a man who loses his wife and is faced with a desolate, empty home. Dave truly unleashes the guitar fury about 2/3 into this song. 4.5.<br /><br />9)Forget To Remember- Lyrically, this song is about his frustration with a family members' bout with Alzheimer's disease. This song has a beautiful tone and a strong chorus, but somehow just doesn't tick all the boxes for me. I give this one a 3.<br /><br />10)Don't Turn Your Back-This song begins with a bluesy guitar intro before launching into a furious guitar riff. Dave snarls about his friends being fake, and I can't help but feel he's got his middle finger up in Lars Ulrich's and James Hetfield's direction. Overall this is a raucous, enjoyable song with a strong chorus. 4.5.<br /><br />11)Cold Sweat-This song is a Thin Lizzy cover. The main riff is very repetitive and to me, gets old kind of quick. The narrative style once again reminds me of \\"Public Enemy No.1\\". This song is probably very dear to Dave Mustaine but feels unnecessary to this collection of music IMO. 3.<br /><br />Despite some peoples' opinions that this album lacks fire, I find this album to be quite enjoyable. If nothing else, every song has a clear identity. I've listened to this album nearly every day for the past month and it's general vibe is so Mustaine it's hard not to like. I know it's not angry enough to be everyone's cup of tea. I especially miss the days of Peace Sells and Rust In Peace, but those days are gone and Dave still does well by us. That's hard to say about some of the others from his generation. Overall a fine album and a worthy addition to your arsenal of Megadeth!
B008EKON56|5.0|Great interface which allows simultaneous charging and line level audio output. Though, I purchased this believing there would be a higher voltage output compared to the headphone amp output of my iPhone. If there is a difference, it's negligible.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|A great game for kids and the parents too. The tokens are overpriced but the game content is great. The newest update is a new change of pace.
B0063M22QO|4.0|This Mahjong provides many hours of enjoyable entertainment.  Stongly recommed for all ages and gender.  Especially like the ones with many different layers of tiles.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Despicable me is so much fun. It's like temple run And temple run 2 but of course it is ally better
B005TBN3EU|4.0|I have a 13 year old son, I wish they could make more funny movies that he could watch, that didn't have nudity & cursing in them.<br />This movie was very funny, but too much cursing!!!!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I would start by saying that the story is soooooooo good it hurts. Heartbreaking, yes but it's so much more. If there's a word that can top the word `heartbreaking' then that's the word. Devastatingly good, perhaps? And I will bravely compare it to THE FAULT IN OUR STARS & when I said compare I meant in a good way though both stories are really not a happy one (I mean not that all hearts & flowers type) or at least not with a happy ending that I was expecting hoping though I kinda of know the ending will not be a giddy one after I read the prologue. If you've read books with stories like this, you have that feeling that you just know it will not end with a `happy ever after'. Yes, I'm in DENIAL. HA! Or maybe it does, if you really think about it, it has a happy ending but not in a typical kind of cliche way. It has more of a happy ending kind of life way. I just don't want to deal with it right now. I'm still reeling.<br /><br />*sigh<br /><br />*deep long breath<br /><br />ME BEFORE YOU & TFINOS is kind of similar. Given the situation, ya know. So that's why I mentioned it. And If may share, I have this list of `BOOKS THAT I WILL NEVER READ AGAIN' and ME BEFORE YOU is included in that list, as well as THE FAULT IN OUR STARS. Hold up! Let me explain. Not because the books are bad but because it's good that it every time I see the cover or read the title, it will remind me of the feeling that I felt when I was reading it and it's not a happy, giddy feeling. It's heartbreaking, devastating, sad, morbid and all that not so good feelings. And I don't want to rehash those feelings by reading the book again. Believe me, you guys should read it coz it's one of the best books I have ever read and I will NEVER forget the story nor the characters of the book. NEVER. It just that it hurts. It will stay with you for the rest of your life, believe me. And I think if I hear or read the names of the characters, it will never be just a name anymore.<br /><br />I will even dare saythat I will read Lolita again but not this and TFIOS. Yes, really. I mean, if you've read Lolita you'll understand and that's like me saying I'd rather eat shit than not drink Coke anymore. Or not. HAHAHAHABut I know you get the idea. And believe me, when I've read Lolita and Vladimir Nobokov's twisted story, I swear to God I will never ever read it again but after reading TFIOS & MBY, I'd rather read it than these two.<br /><br />Now, the question is, would you do it? Unfortunately for me, I will. Without a doubt. And yes, it is not enough. I don't want to live like that. That's not even living in my opinion. To be stuck in a freakin place and have to depend on someone at every turn. I'm not suicidal or dying and I will not say I know how it feels coz I don't but if in God's plan I may experience something like that then yes, I will do it. That given I exhausted all the resources and still end up as a vegetable & no chance of recovering again. Cmon, as a medial practitioner, I know spinal and brain injuries are irreversible. IDK why, obviously scientists haven't figured it out yet and so I will not burden anyone or even myself if I was in Will's situation.<br /><br />BTW, does Dignatas really exist? It was mentioned it was in Switzerland and you know how things works there. I'm just sayin. Well, I heard in Japan there's this place where people who wants to kill themeselves just go and jump or something. So maybe it does exist. I didn't Google it coz it's so morbid and I don't want to read how the process works.<br /><br />Will, Will, Will...<br /><br />*sigh<br /><br />*speechless<br /><br />I'd give it 10 stars but we know it's just up to 5 so 5 stars it is then. I just love that there are writers out there who can write something like this. Ya know, a different story. It's so out of the box and a kind of story that not all will agree to. And these type of stories are like a taboo in a way. Out of your comfort zone kind of way. If it's a movie, it's like Quentin Tarantino meets Lars von Tier minus the explosion and explicit words. Ya know what I mean? The bottom line is, it is good. Not the kind of story that you will feel so giddy about but will give you more... thoughts.<br /><br />And Jojo, THANK YOU. For this book. For this story.<br /><br />** Also posted on my TUMBLR & GR account

B00004WEJZ|5.0|A few weeks ago I had a great time viewing the 1983 James Bond film NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN after seeing it at the movies three decades ago. Lorenzo Semple, Jr.'s script gives NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN more than enough zip to make you forget the story's similarity to THUNDERBALL. And while we don't forget that no fewer than two women doing a lot more than just looking good and a wily antagonist are essential to any work that dares call itself a James Bond feature, Kim Basinger, Barbara Carerra and Klaus Maria Brandauer hit every mark. Last but of course most, Sean Connery demonstrates that, with all due respect to the underrated Roger Moore, when Carly Simon sang, \\"Nobody does it better,\\" she was addressing the wrong Bond.<br /><br />Art is as much what you take to it as what it is. I remember not caring for NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN when I saw it in 1983 but at the conclusion of my viewing thirty years later, all I can say is, \\"Again.\\"

B001M0HGR2|5.0|After watching and enjoying the avengers movie, my kids, fiance, and I decided to start watching each superheros individual movies.  Started with iron man, because hes obviously the coolest.  The movie did not disappoint.
B00BSN0K1C|2.0|The last thing I thought I would be doing is writing a disappointing review and adding it to the long list of others. I was hoping that all the other negative reviews were exaggerated of what one really wanted. If I had seen this toy on the shelf at a storefront, I NEVER would have purchased this measly little figure at the price I paid. At the time when I placed my order, the description stated it was 10 inches, so I figured, `Okay I will pay the listed $ amount', which was in the mid teens. When I finally received this super hero many days after the estimated delivery date, and this is because it did not ship as stated and not because of the carrier, I literally laughed at it and then checked to be sure I order the correct item. As my online order showed, I did, however this SUPERman I received was not really as described. I measured the little guy from head to toe and he is only 6.5 inches, not 10, not 8 as somebody else had received, but 6.5 tiny inches. I'm not one to complain, but come on, how much fun can you have with only 6.5 inches when you are expecting ten. The resemblance was far from Henry Cavill and more like a rendition of an original superman wannabe. The color of his unitard is so dark it appears to be borderline black. I've seen tree ornaments more impressive than this, which gives me an idea what to do with it. Give time for the hype of the film to subside and hopefully the price will be reduced to what it should be, like a dollar per inch.
B00AEBB8H4|5.0|I love this movie and being in blu-ray is awesome. Now I can watch it in had making the experience even better.

B0018M6J90|4.0|Miss Pettigrew is having a rotten day which just seems to be going further downhill, when she makes a small, desperate act of defiance to get a new job and then has to brazen her way through. She ends up meeting many people, going extravagant places, and not acting like a small town ministers daughter should.  It makes you laugh, cry, and think.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|Good reading for all ages 16 and up! Imparts wisdom, acceptance and connections with self and the world around Harold Fry!<br />Liked the down to earth vignettes of characters and the interweaving of them into the total fabric of the story. Completely unpredictable all the way!  Would make an excellent movie!  Recommend it to readers who can't stand to put a book down!  Awesome and will inspire you to become aware of your own pathways in your life of reflections as you read!
B00D6BN9NK|1.0|I just rented this from red box because my mom really wanted to see it. I hated it because the whole movie is shooting at people not funny at all i would not recommend this movie to anyone who does not like shoot them up movies. I am so glad we only played 1.32 to see it. I think it wasn't even worth that if u are a shoot them up then u will love this movie otherwise stay away from this movie

B005JR47R6|5.0|I loved the roller coaster feel of the last show of the series....first you're down because everything is going badly and then the surprise ending.  Wow...kudos to the writers.  It was a perfect &#34;House&#34; ending.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|From the first chapter to the last this was the most gripping book I've read in a long, long time.  I think the thing that makes it so great- apart from simply excellent writing - is the way the reader is drawn in to each character living with them and dying with them.  I would recommend this book to anyone.  You won't be able to put it down!
B005SFR7YE|3.0|Purchased this as a gift.  However, it arrives with the plastic wrap ripped opened.  Making me wonder it was new as was represented.  The person I purchased it for still wanted it but I advised them to view the DVD as soon as possible and let me know if there was any issues.  Also contacted Amazon with a complain about the wrapping with no response.
B00847KFDS|5.0|Virtually every track in this gem showcases the brilliance that is John Fogerty. His choices for each song seem to fit perfectly, whether it's Dave Grohl, or Brad Paisley, or even Bob Seger. Shared this on a trip recently with old folks like me and young ones as well, and everyone knew the songs and loved the killer tracks. The best part is knowing that there's definitely a second album of hits just waiting in the wings....

B00COGXGNQ|3.0|Of course, like most movies if you've read the book the movie will leave you disappointed.  BUT, I'd say if you haven't read the book this movie would be at least 4 stars.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Well, this book starts off rather slowly....no, very slowly....then it gets better.  These two deserve each other.  Disappointed in the end.....sequel maybe?

B003G4W49C|5.0|This book was a fantastically written story. Usually not one for science fiction but I took my kindle with me everywhere until I finished this book. Surprisingly emotional, charming main character, and one of my favorites that I've read this year.
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|No one will ever say that Tom Hanks or Halle Berry are not great actors, the age transitions of time on their faces is worthy of a make-up artisit Oscar.  The senery is spectacular and if you pay close attention to the story (no talking) you too will be able to make it to the end and understand what has transpired during the last 3 hours (yes, 3 hours).  The book is not a nessecarry precurser to enoying the show.  Rent, watch, enjoy

B009IEXKXI|5.0|Well written. I felt like I was on Mars with the character. The technical descriptions of his situation were detailed enough to help me see the difficulty of his situation and his solutions without the author sounding like a tech manual.
B00DU74U74|5.0|I was skeptical at first but after watching a 10min preview on PPV.  I watched it on PPV.  Then bought it as I so enjoyed it I wanted to watch it again.  Loved it.  Really liked the moral of the story.  Very good cast not a whole lot of Special effects.  Just a good story and for once a very good ending.  I recommended this movies to my friends.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is the best awesomest and addictive game and I can't stop playing It  GET THIS GAME!!!!!!!! I think it is a game for anyone.

B000TERLEK|4.0|Just the couple of songs I already wanted made up the price of the whole album, definitely worth it at that cost.
140006922X|5.0|Love this book. Never could swallow the Jesus story yet is such a huge part of my culture and family. Reading this well-written book was both a riveting and insightful experience. The religious affiliation of the author hardly seemed to matter when it came to stating facts. This book is the antidote to the opium.
1878424319|5.0|one of the best books and most powerful teachings. I recomend this book to all truth seakers. god bless you

B009AMAJPA|1.0|Simply awful.  I suppose it is considered artful to make a film that is dark, but this is ridiculous !<br /><br />Most scenes are so dark it is impossible to see what is happening or who is involved. Except for a few recognizable characters, it is often hard to determine from a portion of someone's face dimly lit from a distant light source, whether it is even a character previously introduced.<br /><br />I kept waiting for a scene where someone turns the lights on so I could see what was happening, but I didn't see any; - no indoor scenes with normal room lights, and even those filmed outdoors were apparently made during a solar eclipse or with a lens filter to accomplish the same effect.<br /><br />After viewing one third of the movie I was so confused and annoyed, I simply hit the disk eject.
0062255657|3.0|This is a very peculiar book on many levels.  The writing is peculiar: simple prose that is able to paint a grand, bizarre tale.  The premise is peculiar: an adult novel that is quite short and juvenile in context.  And, finally--and certainly the most important of the three: the story itself is beyond peculiar.<br /><br />I was astonished at the vivid pictures Gaiman painted using the simplest of phrases.  On one moment, we are accompanying a young boy while he is eating toast his dad had burnt.  And then, in quick succession, we are transported into an eerie world of orange skies and lightning-filled winds.  It was quite weird.  And that's just it--I don't get it.  I thought I was beginning to grasp the theme, only to have my themed bread crumbs pecked away by the shadowy birds.  And yes, it is as strange as it sounds.<br /><br />The confused perspective of the book is probably what bothered me the most.  At the author's own admittance, the book is supposed to be in the perspective of a 7-year-old, yet we read several interjections from an adult narrator.  This confuses the tone of the setting, to the point we have an adult talking to us in the language of a little boy.<br /><br />Furthermore, the tale itself seems like an effort to blend Narnia in the world of Harry Potter, but to ill effect.  Instead of a quaint tale to share with our children, we are instructed by the cover of the book that this is an adult-only novel (the word \\"novel\\" being used liberally)--danger! beware! a dead body and a subtle sex scene abide within these pages.<br /><br />In the end, I was glad to have experienced an interesting story told by a well-seasoned author.  However, I can't help but feel that I just stepped off a fast and dizzy ride, set in a Tim Burton world.  This may have been worthwhile, but I'll need to let my stomach settle before passing conclusive judgment.  For now, I'm going to give this book three stars for being well written, but confusing the hell out of me.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I pretty much use this app every night to fall asleep. Gets rid of headaches and helps me wind down at the end of a long day.
B00E5Q1LTY|2.0|Astounding, no doubt high budget special effects are thinly tied to heroic tag lines and obvious, predictable challenges. But the pathos, imagination and richness of story plots that created the multigenerational appeal of Star Trek, is sadly absent.
B004EPYZSK|3.0|When I see nine (9!) screen-writers, it makes me nervous, but DREAM- WORKS pulls it off. Of course with Jon Favreau (\\"Iron Man\\") directing, how could they miss?<br /><br />We have a cast full of Alpha males, snorting and stomping; mind-boggling amounts of Computer Generated blowie uppie stuff; and all the standard Western clichés.<br /><br />Here is part of our cast of hundreds:<br />  * Harrison Ford (\\"Indiana Jones\\" franchise) in full curmudgeon mode, is Woodrow Dolarhyde, the classic successful rancher with a bunch of ranch hands who look like henchmen, a worthless son, and most of the funny lines.<br />  * Daniel Craig (\\"James Bond\\" franchise) is Jake Lonergan, a stony-faced lonesome stranger who is suffering from amnesia, an overdose of testosterone, and a checkered past. Oh...and he has this odd gizmo attached to his wrist...<br />  * Olivia Wilde (\\"House\\") is Ella Swenson, our third blue-eyed lead, who plays another lonesome stranger; this gal seems to have information the rest of them need.<br />  * Paul Dano (\\"There Will be Blood\\") is Percy, Dolarhyde's craven son: spoiled, impetuous and greedy. He's a showoff, too.<br />  * Adam Beach (\\"Combat Hospital\\") is Cal Colorado, the half-breed who works for Dolarhyde; he always wanted to fight alongside his boss. He serves as a translator for the Native Americans who show up.<br />  * Keith Carradine (\\"The Family Tree\\") is John Taggart, the besieged sheriff. His first contact with the aliens is up close and personal.<br />  * Sam Rockwell (\\"Moon\\") is Doc, the peaceful bartender. His wife is one of the first abductees so he HAS to learn how to shoot a gun! Rockwell always improves the quality of a cast.<br /><br />In the Family of Man, you can always expect a few squabbles, but when a stranger turns up in the neighborhood, isn't it time to stick together?
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I read it all in one setting.  Mr. Gaiman is a truly gifted storyteller.  Every book I have read by him has swept me away into it's world.
B004SEUIW4|3.0|Hmmm.... I expected some sort of animated feature, but instead was subjected to the angst of young adulthood in Pittsburgh. I don't suppose I've ever really LOOKED at the poor souls who have to work at the game and ride concessions at a second-rate theme park. Now that I've had an insider's peek, I'll never treat them as invisible again.<br /><br />And another thing: The movie credits actually showed the character and then the name of the actor who played it! What a treat. In the past, the standard way is to show the credits, then it is ASSUMED that we will know the faces for all those names...<br /><br />Okay, back to the movie: Jesse Eisenberg (\\"Squid and the Whale\\") is a newly minted college graduate ready to enjoy his graduation gift: a trip to Europe. Problem is, his father has just been downsized and the parents can no longer afford it. Instead, he is directed to a nearby theme park to work for the summer. He and most of the other employees agree: it is the worst job...EVER!<br /><br />Of course, with all these young adults, hormones are raging, but the gal who most appeals to our hero is played by Kristen Stewart (\\"Twilight\\"). Unbeknownst to her co-workers, this Daddy's Little Girl is having a fling with the (married) repairman, played by Ryan Reynolds (\\"Definitely, Maybe\\"). She is desperately unhappy at home because her widowed father has just remarried.<br /><br />Of course, the cast of characters is populated with nerds, sluts, drunks, druggies, and virgins (...but not for long...). Their boss and his wife are played to comic perfection by Bill Hader (\\"Tropic Thunder\\") and Kristen Wiig (\\"Ghost Town\\").<br /><br />This is a predictable trip down the primrose path for our hero but I was surprised to see Ryan Reynolds play a less-than-admirable fellow this time out. That is quite a change of pace for him. Maybe there's hope yet!

B005FITIGO|5.0|Here we have a timely R-rated thriller that takes place in an investment bank (which shall remain nameless) on Day One of our latest financial disaster. We start with a downsizing: an employee is walked to a glass-enclosed office and heartlessly \\"let go,\\" in full view of his coworkers. As Security escorts him to the elevator with his pathetic banker's box of personal items, he hands a zip drive to a young colleague with the admonition: \\"I was working on this and you need to finish it. Be careful.\\"<br /><br />By the time the young fellow completes the equations and realizes the magnitude of the situation, we are off and running. Of course with 20/20 hindsight, we know exactly how big and how brutal it was, what we only suspected was the extent of protection enjoyed by a self-serving top echelon of officers. Their \\"take-home pay\\" is mind-boggling.<br /><br />Investment banking is still mostly a guy thing: look at the cast:<br />  * Kevin Spacey (\\"Horrible Bosses\\") is a long-term employee, a company man who weeps first for his dying dog and then for his beleaguered company.<br />  * Paul Bettany (\\"The Young Victoria\\") is a mid-level manager, a survivor who knows when to escalate a problem.<br />  * Zachary Quinto (\\"Star Trek\\") is the former engineer turned risk analyst who is handed that zip drive by his exiting boss.<br />  * Stanley Tucci (\\"Captain America\\") is the first man out the door. I loved his story about the impact of a bridge he built across a river in the mid-West before he came to New York.<br />  * Simon Baker (\\"The Mentalist\\") is a shrewd operator who shaves before a 3:00 AM Executive Board meeting.<br />  * Jeremy Irons (\\"Appaloosa\\") is the CEO who sees this as just another bump in the road.<br />  * Penn Badgley (\\"Easy A\\") is a recently hired employee who sobs in a mens' room stall.<br />  * Demi Moore (\\"Another Happy Day\\") tried to warn the officers a year earlier and is now told to keep her mouth shut.<br /><br />It was a subdued screening audience that exited the theater. We have all felt the impact of that period of insanity and greed, so it's time to put faces on the villains. No gunshots, no car chases, no blowie uppie stuff, just self-serving people oblivious to their impact on the economy, and too arrogant to clean up their own toxic mess of derivatives. The R-rating is due to the profanity-laced language used by these fine folks. Get it at Amazon...
0525953728|4.0|We spent such a very long time waiting for the day we finally received the news that Bin Laden was captured or killed, that by the time it finally happened, we thought we had complete closure at last.  I, for one, thought that just getting the news that he was finally wiped off this planet would be enough to close that ugly chapter in our lives and move on.  But it wasn't.  I realized I actually had a thirst for the details of how it all went down.  The actions of Bin Laden and his followers changed all our lives so drastically in this country that just getting the news he was dead, 10 years after the fact, was almost anticlimactic, in a way.  Having the opportunity to get the details of how it all went down from someone who was there brings it all back home again and helps us to heal just a little bit more.  I'm thankful that Mark Owen chose to share those details with all of us, even if our government was not thrilled that he did so.<br /><br />Mr. Owen does go into some detail about the course of events in his life that led us to that fateful night in early May.  At first I didn't want to read all that background information because I craved the first hand account of the event itself. But for many who aren't married to a former marine like I am, I think it's helpful to learn a bit about Mr. Owen's months and years leading up to that night so that the reader gets a bit of insight into the mind set of a person whose job it is to take down the world's most wanted man.  Clearly, it's a job that not just anyone can do.<br /><br />If your life was forever changed by the events of September 11, 2001, then read this book.  It does help you get a little more closure on that chapter in our lives, and gives you a little insight on what it takes to be not just a marine, but a member of the elite Seal Team Six.
B00BEIYLAW|3.0|Jobs is a biography movie that represents the life and career of Steve Jobs, the founder of Apple Inc. It portrays the ascension of the college dropout into one of the leading creative entrepreneurs of the 20th century. Ashton Kutcher plays iconic role in this movie directed by Joshua Michael Stern<br /><br />He begins the movie Jobs with an iconic moment with Steve Jobs inaugurating the first iPod in 2001. As the people rise for a standing ovation he fills with pride. The scene is definitely something that will make the fans go gaga. But do not start expecting a lot after that. The movie as progresses feels like something made for television.<br /><br />Thus it is assured that some other director will pick up the biography again and definitely with a better budget. Another bad thing about Jobs the movie is that it feels rushed. A lot of things passes by the screen even before it can make an impact over the viewer. May be they needed a bigger time line or they needed to drop out some elements to make it look impressive.<br /><br />Ashton Kutcher tries well to adopt the character in the movie Jobs. He exceeds in most of it but you can notice the efforts at certain places. However he did a good job. But the character that has been crafted for Steve should have been more visionary than someone who keeps yelling at people. This something they missed.<br /><br />On a brighter note, Jobs the movie is definitely entertaining for most of the time in the 122 min timeline. They have tried to capture all the important events but again, they have been straightforward. The supporting cast has done well including Josh Gad as Steve Wizniak and Dermot Mulroney as Mike Markkula.<br /><br />There is nothing in the movie Jobs that will take you deeply into the life of Steve Jobs and thus it cannot be accounted as a biopic. With so much information about Steve Jobs available to even a lay man, the movie falls as a bit of lazy attempt. They certainly could have done a lot better.

B007JCP8FE|4.0|Shinedown has remained one of my top 3 favorite musical groups of all time.<br /><br /> Disturbed runs neck and neck w/ my all time top rated classic heavy metal band, Metallica.<br /><br />But to me it seemed that Metallica had fallen short due to one of those \\"life changing\\" accounts w/ some shrink, that \\"de-fanged the beast\\" and left them lacking.<br /><br />Shinedown has gone thru what to be observed, is an \\"self-diagnosed\\" similar overhaul i.e. addiction remission, weight loss/exercise program, a scalping of sorts, change in wardrobe etc.<br /><br />The earth-shattering event occured due to Brent Smiths' \\"no more drugs--lots more love\\" re-think...and that is largely, if not completely due to the fact that children have entered into the picture.<br /><br />All of American society is being revamped due to child safety concerns. Children need to be told the truth, the world isn't ever a \\"safe zone\\" no matter what governments do...so get ready for life and deal with it.<br /><br />Shinedown used to speak to those issues, and paint them as a portrait of unfortunate reality.<br />They have softened their more edgey approach to make a more digestible, less \\"mental puzzle\\" style offering in Amaryllis.<br /><br />If an album has more than three songs that \\"speak\\" to me on some level, I bite for the hardcopy. But I purchased this CD for my beloved wife who loves her Shinedown.<br /><br />\\"Miracle\\" is my song for her on this album.<br /><br />4 stars for less power songs like \\"Sound of Madness\\"<br /><br />Maybe somebody needs a \\"shot%#& blast, a kick in the a$$\\" before the next release.
B009R659L8|4.0|I'm a big fan of MHC's books.  Daddy's Gone Hunting was very exhilarating! This author knows how to deliver on suspense.
B0011Z933S|4.0|Very happy with purchase. Easy to download and music by death cab exellent. Recommend for aged music lovers. I look forward to more creations by this group.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|When I first downloaded this I was very satisfied  but I think that but points can be bought by trading with bandanas
B00B8WXG9G|5.0|Mr Anka sang a few selections from this CD at a recent concert I attended.  I have always admired his enormous talent and showmanship.  His music and love never fails to move me.  The arrangements on this CD are absolutely brilliant.<br />Thank you, Paul for all you have given us during the last 50+ years!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game change my gaming world. I would never get on my kindle fire but when I bought this game I realised the kindle fire is fun to play on.
B008602KQI|5.0|I usually do not care for the popular movies, but this one is worth seeing for older kids and adults.  I think it contains an appropriate lesson for the direction of our country today, and highlights the typical outcome of socialism.  I hope that the young people see that as they watch it.
1608871827|5.0|I usually only collect the \\"Art Of...\\" or \\"Making Of...\\" books for the movies that I truly enjoy and 'Pacific Rim: Man, Machines, and Monsters' has quickly become my absolute favorite book of movie-production diaries. Lavish photos chronicle the entire film-making process from the first spark of idea to the final nose-to-the-grind-stone physical production and creation of the film itself. Highly detailed reproductions of the sketches and illustration process make this book pure eye-candy of the highest quality! This edition even managed to avoid one of my pet peeves when it comes to these types of coffee-table top books: The glossy pages won't smudge with your finger-prints! WOO-HOO!!! In all seriousness; I simply can not recommend this book enough for your home library.
0321934946|5.0|This is done with a great sense of humor, and without a lot of technical jargon.  You see a picture, and he tells you how he did it, and how you can do it too.  It doesn't go into a lot of the detail as to the mechanics behind it, which can be very confusing to a newbie like me.  Love this book.  I'm contantly using it for guidance.  Will be purchasing more of Scott's books in the future.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|I love the app....  I use it all the time....  Everything I need to buy an item or return an item, all in one ....  There is an issue with the tablet app that I'd like addressed....  PLEASE ADD/ENABLE NOTIFICATIONS TO THE TABLET APP.... It's totally annoying because I use my tablet more than my phone, but the phone app has notifications enabled....  I would say that is counter productive.....  NOT GOOD.... (imo)
B001LX2J22|4.0|Red Dragon is one of several movies surrounding the enormous success of the now legendary Silence of the Lambs. While other related movies like Hannibal, Hannibal Rising, and other less-related spin offs suffer from overacting, poor dialogue, and the ever-popular substitution of gore for story-telling, Red Dragon stands out as a well-executed story where an astute audience can play observer to the psychological constituents of two &#34;villains&#34; that are both monstrous and complex. With masterful performance by Sir Anthony Hopkins, who needs no hyperbole, and Ralph Fiennes who gives one of the best performances of his career, in a career saturated with phenomenal acting, this is a must-see for connoisseurs of the psychological thrill & intrigue genre.<br /><br />Story-tellers of today take note: this is how stories are told.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Love this book just as much as the first! Such a rollercoaster of a book . Can't wait to read the third
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I played this game and at first I found it challenging but once I understood it I bought the full version which was an insane 10 bucks but it is a good game and you should get it now.
B004P1JEXE|5.0|Still Reading it and Loving it.<br />Finished the earlier books and this one is good as them.<br />One of the must read Book Series.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|kids love it and was at a good price.  need to see. take the time to watch it with the kids.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I put this on a few hours ago and I'm addicted. I showed my mom and now she is addicted. This is a great app kid friendly. It is simple to use.
B000B589JI|3.0|I love the idea of this canister but I have had difficulty with the seals and keeping the fuel from leaking out.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love the knew up date and the minions plus you get so much bananas if you get the rocket you still can get bananas
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I have been playing this game and it has been keeping me busy.  You do have to wait sometimes for energy to build up to continue but good game.  Best free game by far.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is fun. It helps me when I miss my horse cause my video horse looks like home. I think they should have the energy belonged or have the daily coins and gems.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|I enjoyed this book because it spoke to all women, and men, about the benefits to society at large if more women in all roles leaned in and helped create new societal norms that would truly allow for equality. Diversity and inclusion are critical if we are going to continue to innovate and work through problems we yet to encounter. Recommend the read.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love  this game. It's seriously one of the best games ever. Like seriously. It's so much fun. I also love minions. There so cute and funny. This game just makes my day brighter. I love it.
B002MUAJ2A|5.0|Well written! Easy read! Fascinating! And sooo motivational!!! I truly enjoyed it and read it in one setting! Highly recommended!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The game is good has good graphics too the levels are really cool and pretty funny too<br />Minions are awesome
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Season 3 was wonderful! I was so sad when I watched the last episode. I never wanted it to end. Can't wait until Season 4 comes to Amazon.
B00CWM3F4C|4.0|Really have enjoyed this new release. Some great acoustic songs on this one. Not too many bands out there testifying anymore. A must add to your collection, if you still love to rock.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|There was so many new surprises you never would've expected. There was a lot of action. Best sequel ever! Read this book!
B005Q1W10A|5.0|When it comes to period drama no one does it better than the British. The ensemble cast is superb from scullery maid to lord of the manor. While the series descends into soap opera style at times, most of the time it's a rich tapestry of pre-post WWI English life. I spent many happy hours addictively watching this series - and have no doubt I'll watch it many times in the future. Well worth every penny!
B003YFIUW8|5.0|I have a really hard time reading books and staying interested long enough to finish them but this book had my attention the whole time.
B002BWQ6H6|5.0|It took a bit to understand how this story was unfolding, but then it just did...in a way that seemed at once abstract and real. The separate yet connected lives and personalities had a familiarity to them that made it comfortable to explore even the most difficult aspects of their individual stories.  Beautifully written, beautifully told.
B007HUD6OS|3.0|I prefer mysteries and this didn't particularly appeal to me.  However, I read it to the end, but don't think I'll read another novel by this author.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Writing about the complexities of the human condition, family, nationalism and the like Khaled delivers another \\"can't put it down\\" well written book. As with his two other novels, I thoroughly enjoyed this work of art.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The video arrived on time and in great condition.  Downton Abbey is a great series and we are looking forward to getting Season 3..
B00CHWUWXE|4.0|When I saw that KT was putting out a new album and being inspired from the western landscape of the US that so many other artists I enjoy, I bit. Another plus was that she has teamed up with Howe Gelb, an artist I have great respect for. Listening to side one, one could imagine Nora Jones singing here. Not a bad thing. Having said that, the overall character of the lp is somewhat laid back. As far as sonics go, (lp), very respectable and enjoyable in that it's more of an analog sound that's lacking in most modern recordings. \\"Feel It All\\" really has the H. Gelb fingerprint on it, as does most of side two. \\"How You Kill Me\\" has some interesting lyrics. For me, side two comes closer to what I was expecting from this lp. This is KT all grown up. Somehow I think there are greater things to come.<br /><br />As an aside, the cover art is spectacular!
B004EBZX6W|3.0|Downloaded but didn't use, I'm only rating to clear my list of things to rate. Have a nice day. Goodbye.

B003L77G2Y|5.0|Some disagree with me, but I find &#34;Fringe&#34; better than than the &#34;X-Files&#34; A+++; I will be buying the other seasons!
0143123173|5.0|I have read most of the Longmire Series and I like this one the best.  Written in 1st POV (like all of the series) the unspoken wit and humor seemed to be outstanding in this book. I have and will continue to recommend this book to anyone that wants of &#34;fresh&#34; blast from the old school ways of crime fighting.  Enjoy
B007J4T2G8|5.0|If you are in to romance with exciting passion and non stop drama this is the book for you!!!! Ana and Christian are amazing characters you will fall in love with them both

B002SJIO5E|5.0|May contain spoilers.<br /><br />With director Neill Blomkamp's \\"Elysium\\" nearly upon us I thought I would go back and look at this earlier effort.  This was one of my favorite films of 2009 and earned an Oscar nomination as well.  Not bad for a young South African filmmaker in his first feature.<br /><br />District 9 is a hell-hole slum where extraterrestrial beings are corralled in Johannesburg.  For reasons unknown, their giant spaceship hovers above the city with no violent intent and when finally approached, the authorities found it contained sick and dying creatures.  They look like the dudes from \\"Predator\\" but on a strict diet.  Called \\"prawns\\" by the humans, the aliens are hounded, prodded, teased and worse.<br /><br />As their numbers grow, the government decides to move them away from the city into another more rural area.  The man in charge for the assignment is an unlikely civilian supervisor named Wikus Van e Merwe (a remarkable first time performance by Blomkamp's good friend Sharlto Copley).  Confident, but uneasy of the assignment, Wikus and his group must go door to door to tell the \\"prawns\\" they must move.  In one attempt, the event becomes physical and Wikus accidentally sprays himself with a black oily substance found in one of the shacks.  Over time this becomes serious as Wikus begins to take on physical features of the aliens.  Eventually he is used as a test subject to see if he can activate and fire the alien's weapons.  He can.<br /><br />The film begins as a documentary, even using the faux news reports to authenticate the events.  As the film moves forward, the film become more action oriented as Wikus must evade the authorities and ultimately help the aliens leave Earth.  Blomkamp, who also co-wrote the script with his girlfriend Terri Tatchell, has created a rare thinking man's (or woman's) sci-fi classic.  The story has political and satirical significance as the aliens certainly have much in common with South Africa's apartheid history.  But the movie is also a balls-to-the-wall action thriller.<br /><br />The Blu ray disc compliments the 5 star movie with 5 star production qualities.  Using a 1080p resolution the film has a 1.85:1 aspect ratio as does the theatrical version.  I could find fault nowhere with the picture quality.  Some of the early scenes are shot using the digital handheld cameras that are used in many documentaries.  The later scenes are perfectly presented.  Check out the beard stubble on close ups.  The quality of the creature make-up is  shown as well.  The audio is DTS-HD Master Audio and is in a word perfect.  I use a couple 12\\" subs in my system and they got a workout without being overly done.  Subtitles come in English and English SDH as well as French and Hindi. There are numerous extras.  Refer to Amazon's description above for a list.ry.

B0012NO4WO|5.0|Another VHS favorite that I had to have on DVD. Wow, how young these now seasoned actors looked back then :) Exciting movie, glad I upgraded.
B00AAX68HG|4.0|This is a very cool concept for a game, but the ads are annoying every few levels. Other than that, love it so far.
B000HF4TIM|5.0|I actually have this movie on VHS, and had to have it on DVD. My kids watched it with me and it is now a favorite of theirs.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|Its so much fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I just love it! It's sooooooooooooooo cool!!!!! It's EPIC !!!!<br />!!!!!!! I just can't stop playing it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B001K3K5MO|5.0|A true classic! I had to have on Blu-Ray for the greatest quality. Can't get enough of all the flying!
B004G25V9S|3.0|For me this is the logical conclusion of a path that Opeth has been following since Damnation, if not Still Life. Gradually death metal elements have found an ever smaller role in their music. Since Ghost Reveries, the melancholy has gradually been replaced by a more psychedelic sound. Those who criticize this album for breaking away from the Opeth sound should perhaps listen more carefully to \\"Burden,\\" \\"Hex Omega,\\" or \\"Atonement\\" from Opeth's last two albums. Many veteran metal bands try to develop with age, and go in favour of a more mellow sound.<br />  Two Opeth traits are clear to hear in Heritage. First the songs are just as hard to digest as on any Opeth album. Only hearing them multiple times will let them unfold. The songs are comlex and shift musically often. Also I can't really point to any single song and say that it is a musical failure. Like almost all Opeth albums, the consistecy in quality can be found in \\"Heritage.\\"<br />  \\"Heritage\\" has shed one musical quality that marked every Opeth album, even Damnation, to some degree. That is the mixture of hard and soft. The mixture of musical elements that almost no other band could put together as succesfully as Opeth has. Even songs without death metal grunts, like \\"A Fair Judgement\\" or \\"Closure\\" did this. It is my opinion one of the things that make Opeth really stand out as a band.<br />  One can hear bands like Yes, Jethro Tull, Rainbow, Led Zepplin, and King Crimson in \\"Heritage.\\" While I like all those bands, exploring their influences hasn't in my opinion produced an album that achieves a level of uniqueness or excellence that many past Opeth albums have. The songs I like best \\"Häxprocess,\\" \\"Folklore,\\" and \\"I Feel the Dark,\\" have now all lost their places on my MP3 player. The album, which I first heard directly after its release, finds less and less time in my CD player. While no song is bad, no song also stands out from beginning to the end for me.<br />  Therefore I've sadly come to the conclusion that this album is not really for me. Unfortunately signs at the moment indicate this is the direction Opeth wishes to continue to go, and many old fans like myself will simply be unable to follow them. Still I wish them all the best and can't hold a grudge that they want to go in a new direction when they've made so many albums which rank among my alltime favourites.
1416972242|5.0|I think I read this book in a matter of days. It is very easy to read and has some nice twists in the plot.
B00CEF014E|4.0|While the story starts off slow, almost in movie type fashion with many narratives and colourful phrasing. The story itself takes a long time to get into. However, once you do there is no putting it down. A truly gripping story that takes you into the world of Dana Barnes and her journey through self deprecation to self preservation. The plot twists and turns had me riveted. A well thought out story. A most exciting and enjoyable read.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I'm not sure what to really say, I mean any Myazaki and Ghibli films are wonderful and I can't really complain.
B002GHHHME|4.0|Whatever else one may think about the Schwarzenegger Machine, it made pictures which had a lasting appeal to those who like action without gore or reality.  I just watched this film, 16 years after it was released, and it is as much fun to watch now as it must have been (going by the reviews) when it was young and fresh. It takes real skill to be able to wipe out platoons of men, blow up everything in sight, have the hero riven by steel spikes, battered, bruised and half-dead, and yet not give anyone nightmares, shudders,  or the remotest feeling of  unease; in fact, to give people only the satisfaction of Good Triumphing Over Evil, while all in the cause of a good time had by all. If you haven't yet seen this picture, just imagine a guy falling  out of a plane some minutes after his parachute did, the parachute is way below him, the plane above him, and then.................well, I can't say, but when it is Arnold involved, anything goes, anything is credible.<br />At any rate, you get the idea. The idea is to give the audience a bit of a thrill, a bit of suspense as to the outcome, and lots of fun; to my way of thinking the goal was accomplished in this movie
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book captured my attention from begining to end I recommend this as a down read when your not doing anything because it's so in tense
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Very happy with this purchase and I loved the price, all star wars lovers should take advantage of this deal
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|It was a very refreshing movie. It teaches us how love can conquer all.  Even mental sickness.  In the myst of chaos, one person can make a difference.  It's a love story that touched my heart.
1608871452|5.0|This has postcards, great illustrations, and pictures.<br />I did not pay $50 for this. I paid around $37.  I wish it had more behind the scenes and more detailed info regarding the storylines. Love the visuals.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|Ordered two after I was the movie about Sexto Rodriquez. One was for a gift and the person loved it. As for myself I enjoyed the CD very much.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I can't open the app without it shutting it immediately. It says there is an update on Google play, but not on my kindle. Please fix soon!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I purchased this quite a while ago and just recently got around to reading it....now I'm kicking myself for taking so long.  I've heard people talking about Wool, but not being a huge sci-fi fan it wasn't high on my reading list.  I picked it up the other day (metaphorically speaking, in a Kindle sort of way) and by the end of the first chapter I was hooked. And I discovered that I love dystopian, alternate-future novels! Wool is just that....set in the future in a post-apocalyptic world where mankind has all but destroyed themselves (gee, surprise) leaving just a small fraction of mankind left.  Living in a vast underground silo.  We don't know exactly what happened to Earth to lead to this but the tantalizing hints dropped keep you reading and reading. We have a tight, fast paced plot, characters you care about (even if they do keep dying off), and just the right amount of what-the-hell going on here. I highly recommend it! If you're not hooked by chapter two, it won't be for you, but I'm willing to bet you'll be pleasantly surprised!
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|really enjoyed the puzzles and story, exactly challenging enough to keep my interest....pretty cool graphics and easy to master interface
B00E7PQVHK|4.0|Excellent strategy game that works best on tablets. It definitely &quot;works&quot; on phones, but doesn't control well.  Just too small to manipulate the characters efficiently. The game runs great on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9. The most annoying part of the game is the unskippable cutscenes, but it's a small price to pay for excellent strategy mechanics.
B000T0XEGS|5.0|This production of Traviata is well done I believe that I could turn off the sound and still thoroughly enjoy the movie simply watching all of the visuals.
B00D6QUJ6U|5.0|1997 was a great year for The Bee Gees. Lifetime Achievement Honors at the Brit Awards and American Music Awards, Legend Award at the World Music Awards, induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, their latest album, Still Waters is a big hit in the US, and this concert at the MGM Hotel in Las Vegas. This was their first concert in the US since 1989 and instead of a full scale tour, The Bee Gees chose to perform \\"One Night Only\\" due to Barry's health. The show itself is a very polished production with a very tight band backing up the Brothers' spot on harmonies. Almost all of their American hits are here with the exception of Holiday, Fanny Be Tender, Love So Right and Love You Inside Out, which is understandably omitted due to the large use of falsetto. The early songs such as Words, To Love Somebody and I've Gotta Get A Message To You are performed so well, they sound even better than the original studio versions - something you rarely see by any artist. The acoustic medley includes tracks not performed in many years such as Morning of My Life, And The Sun Will Shine and I Can't See Nobody. Other highlights include a new arrangement of Islands In The Stream, duets with Andy Gibb and Frankie Valli (via original studio vocals) and a duet with Celine Dion on the Gibb penned \\"Immortality\\". The only gripe I have with song selection is the truncated versions of three of their best songs: \\"Nights On Broadway\\" is drastically shortened as part of the acoustic medley, while \\"Night Fever\\" and \\"More Than A Woman\\" are combined into one song.<br /><br />Now for the video. This concert was originally recorded on video tape at a 4:3 aspect ratio. For this blu-ray, the video has been blown up to 16:9 widescreen. For the most part it looks great for 1997 video. The far shots look fine, but the close-ups make the cropping quite apparent. This does not take away from the experience of watching The Bee Gees live and in as close as HD as possible.
B00BX8PG5M|2.0|I read Kenneth Sewell's book Red Star Rogue (highly recommended) that this movie is loosely based on...loosely? Try disconnected. No one knows for sure why or how the sub sank just 400 miles off the coast of Hawaii...for that Sewell's book is downright scary.<br /><br />The real amazing story is the US effort to raise the submarine from the ocean floor led by Howard Hughes. Project Azorian was an incredible endeavor. No one knows just how much or any the submarine was raised. However we know something was because we brought up several Russians sailors...you can even YouTube the ceremony.<br /><br />The movie is a travesty...with ok acting...but really...not one Russian accent? SPOILER ALERT:<br /><br />The ending where the boat was raised and in a Russian port with a dream/ghost sequence is awful. Do yourself a favor and research as much as you can about K-129, Project Jennifer and Project Azorian.
B009E20IB6|4.0|Some really great reading. John Locke is new to me. Michael Connelly has a great history of writing. I look forward to more.
0767812387|2.0|Anunciaron que la película tenia traducción a español y fue mentira aunque la película como tal es buena (Anuncian Lo Que No Es).
B005CKPQNE|5.0|This is one of the best shows on TV.  Amazing that it is as raw and edgy as it is on basic cable.  Love the show and can't wait for this season.
B002SHD9E2|5.0|I had been waiting for a long time for this movie to come to instant queue in Netflix, but it still hadn't happened and then<br />the one night I was browsing Amazon for something to watch and there is was! I was so thrilled! lol<br />Anyhow, the story was very good, and I would add another comment, but don't want to spoil it for anyone else.<br />I absolutely loved having Gerard Butler in this. It was the first time I'd ever seen him in a character like this.<br />And surprised when I heard him singing. That was awesome and slightly odd at the same time. lol But not gonna knock<br />it at all! Love it! If you are a Gerry fan and love a good chick flick, mixed with lots of opera then you'll love this movie.<br />Honestly, I have never seen the Phantom before this. So this was just amazing to me. I can only imagine how it must<br />be to see it on a live stage.<br />Bottom line, Loved this movie! Excellent, and being able to see it on my tv with Amazon, even better. :) Thanks Amazon!
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|This game is fun but only on I.O.S any thing made for android  sucks. All this game does on kindle is get stuck on loading screen

B004ZRV3AU|2.0|We watched the video several times to put it together and the correct view is not there.

Please help at ps7444@verizon.net.
B000MD7OKY|5.0|Another great classic movie from a time when movies had scripts and real acting.  Of course anything Alfred Hitchcock directs is going to be good.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|I loved this game...until the last update. I used to spend hours playing the bingo games and the slots. Now the rooms will not load, my coins and bingo chips have disappeared to the point that even if I could get in a room to play, I couldn't because my chips and coins continue to disappear. I have sent support 2 queries now with no response. The form says 24-48 hours, it's been approx. 5 days. I hear that a new room was opened yesterday but it doesn't show up on my game. I have cleared cache, history, cookies, uninstalled and reinstalled the game with no improvement. I would have given this game 10 stars, it was that enjoyable, but now I would give it 0 if possible, but since I can't, I give it 1 star until it is fixed, then will reevaluate.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER. I had to choose between temple run and this i am so happy i chose this game it takes the childish  perspective of despicable me and adds the fun of temple run but it improves it by far

B00C1N9JWO|4.0|I have read all of Nalini Singh's books and of the Psy-Challenging series, I found that the first (Slave of Sensation) was the best, and the second was second best, etc.  I am thinking it is because it is getting too complicated as the series unfolds. The first had the story line and the basic conflicts of the Psy life, but the story was king.  Now, we have the story line, which is great, but juggling the &#34;breakdown of the net&#34; with the Ming/Sasha conflict continuation, the Father/Judd/Vasic trio with Father's lost loved one, and everyone trying to kill everyone... It makes me weary. I would like the stories simplified a bit so the story is king again. But that all said, Singh really writes well and can spin a good relationship story (not just romance, but the conflict of various personalities that go into the blend), and even if this is not her best, it still is very good and all of her books are worth reading. It is not a risk to buy them. I know I will enjoy the book.  I am not QUITE finished yet, but with one chapter left, it is still good. That does say a bit, though, that I was able to put it down one chapter from the end. I could not do that in her first P-C books.
B007MG360G|5.0|Great I love  its so fun and my brother helps me get get new items and I also help him him get new groups and we just love it
B0076DELIG|5.0|Michael Connelly is one of those authors one can buy with the assurance of a well told police procedure novel.  Additionally, Harry Bosch is revealed with both good qualities and flaws equally shared.  Although involving a 20-year old murder, this story is told in today's techniques.  A page turner!
B00C7JGDBW|2.0|Somewhere, somewhen, a bunch of idiots sat around a boardroom and thought `Hey, a prequel to possibly the greatest and most beloved children's movie of all time might make some money!  Let F***ing do that!`  So, as idiots are inclined to do, they took the basic seed of genius from the movie and dressed it up in all of the shallow crap that they themselves find entertaining.<br /><br />Why did you take OZ and turn him into a guy whose sole purpose in life is to get every woman he meets into bed?<br /><br />Why did you take a character who spoke some of the best and most complex prose the movies have ever seen and give him the same IQ level as a high school dropout?<br /><br />How could you take a world and a storyline so simple in focus and so complex in process and turn it into just another damn episode of `Friends?`<br /><br />Shame disappeared a long time ago.  It`s too bad.  We miss it.  A lot of people miss it.  At this particular point of time, I miss the quality of the movies it used to produce.<br /><br />I gave it two stars because of the set design.  It is an attractive movie.  Burning the actors and writers at the stake though is probably taking it a little too far.  At the very least, please get them away from the movie set.  Bring in some adults next time.
B000SEIK2S|3.0|This book has very cool scientific and technological concepts.  It connects these with their potential cultural and personal impacts, which is also very interesting.  However as a story it is very predictable, and never really hooked me.  I thought the characters were a bit two dimensional and flat.<br /><br />So, it kept be interested enough to read it, but in the end was disappointing.
B005XLN97M|4.0|This was a gift for our Grand Daughter - Had it shipped to her. We could tell it was a good pick from the excitement in her voice. Something fun & simple to start her off with her first Barbie Doll.<br />I Only Selected a 4 Star Because I did not get to see & judge it for myself. Would recommend this to a friend.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I really love this game I can probably play it for days. The graphics are great. Most of my games have a lag but this does not and it is great.
B00CM9JKQM|4.0|Being a die hard Queensryche fan since their first EP, I was skeptical about this album without Tate. I have to say, this is their best since Empire. Todd La Torre sounds great and is the perfect fit for Queensryche. Geoff Tate will always be one of my favorite vocalists, but La Torre has brought back the excitement I have for Queensryche's music!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Very fun and addicting game! Has a few glitches in certain spots but other than that its pretty fun though.
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|I loved this book. The characters were marvelous and believable. I'm hooked on Courtney Milan. But read the Governess Affair first!
B000VMFDW2|4.0|Interesting read. Many real life experiences expressed In a realistic manner. I recommend the book. You won't be sorry for the purchase.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is great for people who like the game temple run because its just like it just minion style!!!!! Lol
B000MD9UJC|5.0|My wife found an old Maglite while cleaning out a closet, and wanted to toss it.  I thought it would be a waste, and came here for a replacement lamp.  This LED lamp was much more than I expected.  It is extremely bright, and comes with a cool button cap for the battery compartment.  It works so well, my wife grabbed it as soon as she saw it.  'Nuff said, there.  The instructions could use an upgrade, but I had no problem doing the repair.
B000IDEORY|5.0|I watched this twice in a row--I've probably seen it at least 50 other times, so this was just a repeat for fun.
B00881VLCE|3.0|it was working great until the upgrade. moves very slow. don't like the new pieces of puzzle. go back to the original setup. grab pieces of puzzle and takes<br /> for ever to move them.
0307744434|4.0|I bought this book not knowing a thing about it.  I enjoyed it from the beginning and I loved it at the end.  Although I think it would be a challenge to do the book justice, I feel it would be a visually stunning movie.  If someone is tight with Baz Lurhmann (Moulin Rouge) give him a ring....
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I love Jessica Lange, she is riveting in her roles, and never disappoints me.  This was a good drama, with a supernatural twist.
B008SOS63S|5.0|Small wonder Jack Bruce, Eric Clapton, et. al. play with Joe. Joe is simply amazing...and only getting better and better. What a treat!
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|I think deep within all of us, we seek to stop evil and Dexter allows us to vicariously through him to stop evil that is allowed to continue beyond what should be allowed.  He is our knight in a very dark way.
B003ZJ70W4|2.0|This movie really just feels like the actresses, the execs and whomever else is responsible for making this movie wanted to milk SATC for all it's worth. It was so pointless, such dribble, so cringe worthy, that I regret paying the renting fee on here. Plot? what plot, Oh you mean where Carrie comes across as a spoiled, entitled, rich brat... Or Samantha is quickly becoming one of those 50 something women who are so desperate to stop aging the make themselves look older. Charlotte is stagnant in her life, and ahhh Miranda, thank heavens for her . I would have really loved if they focused more on Miranda and Charlotte's story lines. Trying to survive mommyhood and still staying &#34;true&#34; to yourself. We saw maybe a small glimpse of Charlotte's new life as a mom of two young kids. There needed to be more, because I can easily see how someone will see Charlotte's life of riches , including a nanny, and the moment it got a little hard she had to run away half across the world to &#34;cope.&#34; Carrie and Samantha seemed to be in the same , they never change boat. In the desperately trying to hold on to your ...30s or late 20s... Carrie finally gets what she always wanted, a life in which Big only wants to be with her. They have a beautiful home and life and he adores her, he is finally really available to her, they both agree they do not want nor need kids. But now, she is the one with the problem. It is a boring life which yes, life does need some spice. And getting a tv as a gift you did not ask for was not the best, but his intentions were good. He wanted to watch old Hollywood movies with her. All she did was bitch and moan and ran away. Oh and kiss someone else, and what does she get when she comes back,,, A nice new shiny ring. It was a rare moment in which you disliked Carrie , almost throughout the movie and actually really liked Big. Don't get me started on Sam and how culturally insensitive and rude she was. Hello if you go the middle east you are goingto expect conservative rules, I don't care how much of a sex loving succubus you are , respect another country's culture for crying out loud! Watch it only if your gf already has it and you don't have to pay to watch it. Although, you may have to pay in other ways!
B0061S0A64|5.0|love it!!!!!! it is sooooooo cool u can create or listen to beats and record and share!!!!!! nodebeat rules! !!!!!!!!!
B00AESN8XY|4.0|A very fun game, if  not a bit hard. Not to mention the fun of naming your disease something like THE POOPS, lol. It's a good way to pass time, and in those later and higher levels, you really have to put some thought into it.
B005JIV0NE|1.0|There is problem with the optics that prevents me from being able to use it with my Kinect sensor.  This is the first Nyko product that I have had a problem with, so it may be how I have my system setup.  However, better product documentation and installation tips would be help, so I feel Nyko dropped the ball in that respect with this product.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|It's mahjong. Easily one of the best free mahjong apps out there. There's nothing overly special but nothing terrible. A good way to pass the time for free and to play mahjong!
1936608898|5.0|I started CrossFit one year ago and the big trend at the box is Paleo eating.  A few months ago, there was a '30 day whole' challenge.  So I bought the book and completed the challenge.  I am not a person that has any food allergies or digestive issues to speak of, but this book really gave me a lot of useful and interesting information.  To your health!
B003YL4KS0|2.0|Though there was a section for kinky hair, most of the book was geared towards curly, not kinky hair.  If you have multi-cultural hair or tight kinky hair-- or are dealing with your child's multi-cultural hair--there must be better books out there.  I returned this and plan on looking elsewhere. For Black and Mixed hair this is not the holy grain.
B0009QBLA8|4.0|More than 35 years after its initial release, Eraserhead remains a curious enigma wrapped in shadowy symbolism. It's a shining example of what can happen when a director cracks the door open just enough to glimpse his vision, but not enough to fully grasp the story. David Lynch, for better or worse, intentionally or not, delivered a heck of a story, but stumbled on the punchline.<br /><br />Others have already spelled out the plot, but in a nutshell: Henry Spencer (Jack Nance) is seen in the opening, in a montage with the 'Man in the Planet' who manipulates a sperm-like creature (which has exited Spencer's mouth) and the creature appears to fall to earth. Later, we're introduced to the world of Henry. He's a Nobody, the anti-hero. A printing company employee on vacation who returns to his dreary apartment building to be informed by his sexy neighbor across the hall that 'Mary' has called, and wants him to have dinner with her parents. Mary appears to be a past love interest. Henry obliges and finds that Mary's family puts the 'funk' in dysfunction. From the catatonic grandmother to artificially chipper father Bill, the dinner goes from bad to worse when the 'baby chickens' (probably Cornish game hens) weren't cooked long enough. This is one of the best scenes of the entire film.<br /><br />Mary's mother soon corners Henry and informs him that Mary had a baby, and that the two should marry. But the baby is anything but. Imagine an infantile 'E.T.' Henry and Mary are now in his apartment, but the infant's incessant crying forces Mary to return home. Henry now embarks on a series of bizarre visions and dreams as he attempts to care for the strange infant. The finale, both shocking and graphic, leaves the viewer wondering, what the heck did I just see?<br /><br />Much of what this film has going for it is atmosphere. The sounds are creepy. Now add to it the pipe organ meanderings of the legendary Fats Waller. And we see Henry as he travels what resembles a post-industrial landscape. We hear the noises of factories operating, but nowhere near total capacity. One can easily imagine modern day Detroit, with its large areas of urban blight and abandoned housing, the result of 50+ years of liberal politics and the greedy hand of the auto unions. A city dying, a city in decay. The film is as stark as the visions shown, a curious play on light and shadows. It's difficult to imagine this movie in anything BUT black and white. But it was used to great effect by Lynch.<br /><br />But at the end, there are too many questions and not enough answers. A director can leave too much to the audience to try and interpret. Much has been made about the sexual undercurrents, but was the baby the epitome of the fear of fatherhood? Was the child an alien implant? And just who was the Man in the Planet? An intergalactic father looking for a surrogate parent? And the Lady in the Radiator, was she trying to draw Henry away from the dark side and to the Light? It could be argued (and I'm sure there will be plenty of argument) that Eraserhead might be the horror film equivalent of Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. Long after you've stopped pondering about the plot, the nightmarish images will stay with you.<br /><br />TRIVIA: Due to funding problems, it took more than 4 years to complete the film. The late Jack Nance (1943-1996) kept his crazy hairstyle for the entire time, until the movie was completed.al landscape. We hear the noises of factories operating, but nowhere near total capacity.

1573226521|5.0|I've never contracted malaria or gone on an opium bender, but this book is probably as close as I'm going to get.  It's narcotic, it's hot weather hypnotic.  Read it.
B00AX6KMGS|3.0|This movie was so dumb but yet give me interested the whole time all the bad acting was so  funny and the movie was good
0316066524|5.0|Having read a couple of DFW's essays and believing him to have been among the most intelligent writers ever, my boyfriend and I suggested this for our summer book club.  Nobody else seemed to get through enough of it to come to the meeting, so I guess we broke the book club, but it was totally worth it.  This is one of the best things I've ever read and I can't recommend it enough.  It's long and heavy and your wrists will ache from holding it, but it's not that difficult or dense to read.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is the best app ever. everyone should love it what a great game it is the best. best ever

B000FBJAEG|4.0|I like his books.  They hold my interest and I do not want to put it down.  I just love the way he write.  I love the mystery.  It is hard to determine the ending, but this time I did get close.  Keep up the suspense.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|If you love games like subway suffers you will love this game! You not only get to run and avoid obstacles but you can beat people from the actual movie to get to other levels. This is a game I highly recommend.
B004TI5N38|4.0|Great book.  I enjoy David's books.  Love the mystery.  I like trying to figure out the ending.  I am not always right, but I sometimes get close. Keep writing these great books.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|If you like room escape games, you will probably like this game.  It is not as fancy or complicated as some, but is still fun.  You might need paper and pencil to keep track of clues.  A great free game!
B00DHSK3RM|2.0|They need to come out with CANDY CRUSH SAGA. THIS APP SUCKS it useless don't get it  my opinion . They have this but not candy crush saga
034537410X|5.0|Actually, I bought and read this book a few years ago and picked it up again three weeks ago.<br /><br />I followed the advise and started a dream journal, doing reality tests during the day...etc.  Only thing I do additionally is listen to a \\"Hemi-Sync\\" tape everyday on the web.<br /><br />Had my first lucid dream last night after about three weeks after rediscovering the book.  Totally cool!  I've had them before, but it's the type of thing that is so cool it doesn't lose it's novelty!  And it really defies satisfactory description.  Absolutely fantastic altered state of reality!!<br /><br />Another tip.  Stare at your hands during the day and before going to bed.  I did so in last night's dream and I was missing a thumb.  So I knew \\"this is it!\\".  Looked at my hands later in the dream and one of my fingers was bent really funny.<br /><br />Get the book!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|its very very spectacular and cool. this game has great action. Its also cool too play.The minnions are fun too play as.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|This is just like the xbox version; great game.  Good intro to Magic the Gathering while still being fun for MTG veterans like myself to play.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this is a great game for all ages.. my 4 year old granddaughter. and my 7 year old grandson. love it and even my daughter does too..lol well and yes.. me too
B005LAII4E|3.0|Regardless of whether or not this movie holds true to how we all think of G.I. Joe, it has some movie flaws that just make it painful to watch and like.  There were a couple of scenes that left you scratching your head asking why did they even just show that.  They either had nothing to do with the story at all or they felt out of place.<br /><br />A lot of the acting as well was just a little on the bad side.  Some of that was do to what I thought was bad dialog.  I could not find any character that I could like.  Dwayne's acting really did feel like he was reading the script from paper for the first time.  Nothing flowed well for me.<br /><br />If this was on a channel that I paid for I would watch it.  If given the choice would I purchase it again?  No.  Not worth the 20 bucks.  I am most certainly glad I did not take the family to the theater and pay to see it.
B0052SF6CM|4.0|The only reason I give it 4 stars cause there's one song I don't like on this album but other than this album is amazing :D
055380684X|3.0|Citing recent discoveries in neuroscience regarding the importance of myelin, Daniel Coyle makes a persuasive case for what many of us already knew: many hours of dedicated practice under the tutelage of a teacher or coach who can individualize instruction allows a student to reach their fullest potential.  As a teacher, I appreciate the validation, but Coyle's approach seems a little like utilizing a new branch of mathematics to prove that the Earth is round.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I enjoyed this book and appreciate it for preaching the gospel of hard work.  It is almost entirely anecdotal, but at least the anecdotes are interesting.  Coyle's style is a bit too breathless and excited, and it is impossible to escape the feeling that one is being sold a bill of goods, but when that bill of goods turns out to be the message \\"buckle down and persevere,\\" I can't complain too much.  Coyle's anecdotes support his thesis best when they are drawn from the world of sports; they are less convincing when they are drawn from the success stories of pop music stars.  I'm not sure we all agree that Jessica Simpson represents the epitome of fine vocalization; her superstardom relies at least as much on the production and promotion of her music and the fact that she was blessed with a pretty face.
B009DCOU9S|3.0|It's difficult to put item where they belong at times because it seems as if it has to be exactly on that tiny spot<br />being as I can't see under my finger.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Stephen King did a great job creating a realistic world revolving aroung the JFK assassination. I am not american so I cannot comment on the historical details (true-false) of the story regarding Oswald but as far as the fiction goes, the storytelling leading to the day-title is amazing, typical King-standard writing skills. I loved it!!!
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I thought the book was just okay. The author is very very smart, so when he got into the medical jargon the book became a little boring. I was expecting a huge revelation about the after life, but thought everything he saw we heard before from other nde. I guess I was hoping to find out how we find our relatives and what God might look like. The book was interesting but not a page flipper.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|I LOVE THIS GAME. EASY, MATCHING &amp; GREAT GUIDE!!! I RECOMMEND THIS GAME FOR ALL AGES, SHAPES, SIZES AND COLORS!! IT'S A MUST HAVE GAME!
B0037NVM2C|5.0|Arnie at his best! Watched Terminator 2 on Roku-TV with IMDB page opened on iPad for trivia, goofs and quotes. Great combo!

B004HWYTP4|4.0|Good movie. Funny and good actors. Now to see if I can watch the sequel, Red 2. Would recommend to everyone.
B00280LYIM|4.0|This book is amazing with all the monster fighting and they found Nico Di'Angelo and I don't want to spoil anything but Percy's father Posiden actually comes to Percy's house to see him on his birthday while Percy's mom's boyfriend is there and he is mortal
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|The puzzles are entertaining and not too difficult.  Rather enjoyable.  If you are looking for something quick and easy, this is it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Omg! The twists and turns this book takes...... just when you think you have it all figured out it all changes again. Great read. Thank heavens for book club because I probably would not have ever picked this book up.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|This is a game I started playing a year ago. In the past 4 months or so, Buffalo has started to make it more profitable for themselves by using their players. Games are more restricted & have been made so much more difficult in the hope of making their players have to buy credits. Or buy the power ups that were free, even the more desirable ones. I will say I still play it & I'm still an Elite member. But as soon as I find a game I like as much, where the players are appreciated more, that status will change.
B001NLKWLW|4.0|I chose 4 stars because like her other The House at Riverton, Forgotten Garden gets off to a slow start. So slow you almost want to put the book down.But when the granddaughter starts unraveling the puzzle pieces of Nell's early life is where it really starts to get interesting. Cassandra's friend, Christopher - a former medical student, sheds some additional light on Nell's past. It may be slow but it's still worth the read. It doesn't end like one would expect!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is the best show on TV at the moment.  I love all the characters, the interplay, the connection to historical events, and the writing.  The dowagers lines are amazing, informative, historical and sarcastic.  Maggie Smith is a great great actress and choice for this role.  I wish she was my grandmother.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very nice game, but there are few levels in the game. Will wait for update. Thank you for good game!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|The passion, obsession, love; it makes it unbelievable, I am hooked.  Fifty Shades what?  It is Crossfire from now on!
B005544TRQ|5.0|If you like courtroom drama but also delving into the personal lives of the characters, this is a great show for you. Fast paced, well-acted, hilarious, and intelligent series. Having 3 seasons available makes it great for binge watching (which is something I totally do.) It's also great to watch if you want a little mindless entertainment in 45-min chunks. I watch the pilots for this series and &#34;Scandal&#34; within the same week and I chose this show to watch regularly.
0525478817|5.0|Wow, I am almost speechless. I really don't want to do a review since I don't think I can do it justice. I'll give it a shot though. I got this book as a gift. A friend of mine said it was a great read, and he couldn't put it down. So he bought me a copy and told me to read it. I did! and Wow!! My breath was taken away, I cried, I laughed out loud, I cried, I wanted to throw the book (if it wasn't a Kindle copy) across the room, I yelled at the characters for being stupid!! I felt like I was a ghost along for a ride with the characters. I was on a whirlwind with this book. I think it was due to the fact the subject matter hit close to home and I honestly felt for the characters. From the very beginning, I was entranced with this book. It drew me in and wouldn't let me go til I was done. So thank you my friend for giving me this gift!!
B003KRJNBW|3.0|With a plot as full of holes big enough to drive an armoured bus through, you'd think the movie would be annoying, but it's actually fun to watch.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is great. It helps me get ready for when I'm old enough for my own (: I recomend this app!!
B005M2A4D4|5.0|Matt Smith continues his journey as the 11th Doctor in series six.  These are his further adventures with Amy and Rory (two of my personal favorite companions).  This collection is essential for Whovians especially in the 50th anniversary year.  The Doctor's story is building up to something really big.
B000FC2KL0|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed learning about Anthony's childhood. What a crazy ride. The forming of the band and reading about all of crazy situations made it hard for me to put the book down.
B002JVWRAO|4.0|I came late to the show, having dismissed it at first glance-- assuming it was simply an all-action Hardy Boys clone for teens. I was dead wrong. I'm glad someone convinced me to give \\"Supernatural\\" a try. I started watching the DVD's with season one and just kept plugging away over a few months, finishing season five recently. This show is quality. There has not been one episode where I said, \\"That was a waste of time\\". Everything is top notch here: writing, acting, cinematography, editing, production design, music scoring. Sure, it has its clunky moments now and then (nothing's perfect), and some writers do questionable things, but on the whole it is a good TV experience.<br /><br />If this had been merely a festival of monster-killing I would not have fallen under the spell. Instead, we have something with depth and fun and richness. There are wonderful stand-alone episodes, and there is the ongoing story arc (which began to grow tedious, but that's my own peckadillo), and there are a couple of downright hilarious episodes.<br /><br />The writers never forget what the point is here, the story of a tattered little family. Sam and Dean are outstanding characters who change, grow, fail, cry, bicker, and persevere. Somehow I never tired of their Luke Skywalker/Han Solo personalities. Dean's rock 'n roll attitude and his fondness for pie and cheeseburgers made him so likable. The main appeal of this series is these two brothers, because we grow to care for them and like them.<br /><br />My favorite seasons are the first and second, but each one so far has had its good points. This fifth season gave us several things to like, but the most memorable to me was the change in the character of Castiel, who loses his angelic power and is reduced to hitting the bottle (and trying to figure out how to leave an outgoing voicemail message on his phone). Brilliant stuff, and a good actor in Misha Collins pulling it off. It was fascinating seeing him go from the strong 'film noir' persona to an awkward, lost goofball.<br /><br />And we have yet another delicious season climax, leaving us wondering what lies ahead for the Winchester boys. I look forward to the next chapter.persona to an awkward, lost goofball.<br /><br />And we have yet another delicious season climax, leaving us wondering what lies ahead for the Winchester boys.

B009POHHR6|4.0|When asked about what story to read from a someone who never read a Superman story a lot of people suggested Red Son. So I decided to pick up a copy. It's a good story but not great. It's also an alternate universe Superman. For my money, if your looking for a great Superman story you should read \\"A Superman For All Seasons.\\"
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love this game. It dissolve much fun. Hours can go by without you even realizing it. I wish there were more games like this.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Nemo's Reef is so beautiful; it feels like I am right under the water in the reef. Building the reef and attracting more fish and even rare fish is extremely fun and interesting. Plus, the dialogue between Nemo and Marlin, and even Mr Ray's comments and instructions, have taught me quite a bit about reefs, the plantlife that lives there, the coral, and the fish. I would recommend this for older children, all the way to adults. Have fun. I am.
B007N8RULO|5.0|It really helps pass the the time as I have to spend a lot of time at doctors and hospitals.  Very enjoyable.

B00CW7KK9K|4.0|I own both the Fitbit (the old school simple one you put on your belt) and Nike Fuel, and now the Pulse.  My comments below reflect the first few days w/ the product. I'll update this review once I have more time with the unit.<br /><br />It's very small, almost too small. I am very concerned about losing it, but I love the way it integrates into the Withings ecosystem.<br /><br />The build quality is not bad, it is only 8grams so it's feather light. BUT: Don't wear it in the shower like you can w/ the Nike Fuel, or it will end poorly - it's not water resistant.<br /><br />1) I am having trouble getting to read my pulse. I can't seem to figure out the 'sweet spot' for my finger on the rear sensor. I with the display would tell me when I am in a good spot and it's measuring my pulse so I know to stay still.<br /><br />2) I like the sleep analysis...but I have NO idea what to do w/ the data.  Deep sleep? Ok? Light ? Yup. But how do I make my sleep better?<br />Also, I wish I could set it up to automatically detect the time and flip to sleep mode. I don't like having to manually do it.<br /><br />3) I wish there was more feedback on the UI. Beeps or haptic feedback would be great. I also wish it had an alarm and vibration to wake me up. It's on my wrist, why not take advantage of that placement and be a wake up alarm?<br /><br />4) The UI is simple and very nice but not very readable in direct Sunlight<br /><br />5) The iPhone App is great - I can manually sync the data even while the app is not open<br /><br />6) No way to sync to a PC or Mac...you must have an iPhone or Android device to set it up.
159463176X|5.0|I only started reading the book 3 days ago and can't put it down. I bring it everywhere so that when I have a spare moment I can catch up on a few pages.  At first you think it will be about one thing, then it twists and you think it is going in a different direction and then everything connects.
1451695195|3.0|kind of got the impression the author is narcissistic, and that colored everything he said.<br />his comments were what you would expect.
B002ZG98LO|4.0|now when you see adrian brodie and a sexy latina lady in a film you know it's probably, at the very least, a slight intrigue. i dont know her name and i dont care to learn it because falling for her would be too disastrous but that woman in the film is utterly gorgeous and then when you put a six-pack ab-ed adrian brodie next to her you find yourself in a world of hurt. yes this film has all the glorious gore and beauty of the original predator films, the badass hunt scenes and kickass actors to boot. but what really made this film for me was the great sense of surprise that had been lacking in the previous incarnations. and i think thats because in 1 and 2 there was no love interest. it's difficult to put love in such a brutal context but when it prevails here i find myself at a loss. this is what the original alien flick had going for it. when ripley risks her life for that little feline. it's desperate, it's bizarre, it's wonderful. and i just watched this film last night and can't stop thinking about the conundrum of an ending. will they make it? i know they will. but still. will they? i want to watch the film again because the special effects (while admittedly not the best in the biz) dazzle and seeing monsters mutilate monsters is goddam fun. go buy this film. i did and it was super cheap and if you slightly like sci fi you're an idiot not to check this out and plus there's tons of video-game-style murder and that's all right. some folks can't stomach this stuff and we love em for their faults but when us nerds come together to witness such messy fun it's a delight. go see it. see it again. make your girlfriend endure the naughty bits and tease her for squeamishness. action. blood. awesome. fun.

B000SEGUDE|4.0|As ambitious and genre-breaking as it is flawed, David Mitchell's Cloud Atlas nonetheless succeeds wonderfully as a literary project that spans genre, style, and assembly.<br /><br />Quite unlike anything I've ever read, Cloud Atlas is incredibly enjoyable, if quite the burden to tackle. It's not light afternoon reading by any means. Rather, it needs to be tackled diligently and with determination, lest one be defeated by its unusual form, and, at times, difficult to read, text.<br /><br />You would do well to dedicate an entire weekend to reading Cloud Atlas end-to-end, so that you can both admire Mitchell's writing, and the ambition he's managed to achieve in bringing forth this book, which is unlike anything you will read again.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|A book to touch your heart, open your eyes and keep you reading from beginning to end.  Well written with strong voice from multiple viewpoints.
B00992CF6W|4.0|The only app that is better than this one is the full version but that is it I give it four stars
B006OFN0SE|4.0|J. Edgar Hoover served an unprecedented length of time and possessed unprecedented power.  For someone whose job was to enforce the laws and capture those who broke them, Hoover seemed to never allow the U.S. Constitution get in his way. Hoover famously gathered and hoarded information to protect himself and reign in politicians.  President Nixon has been rightly criticized for thinking and acting as if \\"the President\\" is above the law.  The same was true of Hoover.<br /><br />Hoover was lucky to have three people devoted to him -- his mother, his secretary Ms. Gandy, and Clyde Tolson.  Hoover lived with his mother until she died.  His basic character apparently could partially be explained by the dynamics of his relationship with his mother.  Ms. Gandy preferred to be married to her job rather than to Hoover though she loyally served Hoover until he died.  Hoover's 40 years plus relationship with Clyde Tolson is perhaps even more fascinating and determinative.  Director Eastwood purposely left the Hoover-Tolson relationship ambiguous.  It seems clear that Tolson loves and admires Hoover, but not as clear how Hoover feels about Tolson except Hoover needs Tolson by his side.  Whether any of that involved sex is not clarified.<br /><br />At first glance the idea of this movie might seem boring, but in actuality it was fascinating to watch this flawed man with his obsession about Communism remain in power while eight Presidents came and went.  How does anyone get such power much less expand it and keep it over almost 50 years?
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This book grabbed me from beginning to end, much as the two previous books I've read by Khaled Hosseini. I couldn't wait for his next book to come out, and I wasn't disappointed. This gentleman always shows a fantastic sensitivity and passion for his characters which makes them come alive to me. I stay enthralled thoughout, and hate to see the end of the book coming. Please keep your efforts coming Mr. Hosseni!
B005544TRQ|4.0|Although I have not finished the first season yet, I find Suits to be a very interesting and entertaining show. Each episode has been good thus far and I plan to continue to watch this show.
B008602KQI|5.0|Gripping and enjoyable movie. Anxious to see if the sequel is going to be as good. It was worth the money.
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|Americanah was a great read. I kept asking myself, ' and then what happened'  I would recommend it to anyone one who likes to read and those who enjoy learning about other cultures. The author had me from the beginning begging for more.
B00BBF3BO0|4.0|It works to put your project together.  I used it for a novel I am writing and it really helped.  The instructions could be more expansive and it would help to be able to know what others are using it for.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I GOT THE GAME A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO AND I LOVE IT.  I LIKE THE FACT THAT YOU BUY EVERYTHING WITH BANANAS.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I had trouble reading this book at first. The start is a bit disjointed, but as you wind around the corners become less sharp and the voice of the story clearer. This book is not for the feint of heart. Nazi Germany is seen through the ghettos of a German town and it is not pretty. The look at humanity in its worst and best moments is strikingly harsh at times. It's definitely a narrative that won't let you forget a dark human history.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|one of the best 007 flicks out there, good plot, fantastic shot movie,many twist and turns, do not hestitae to see it
B0002ADY0Q|4.0|I have the U.S. vinyl edition and will briefly review the new CD tracks at the end.<br /><br />\\"Side A\\" is par for the course for this band:<br /><br />1. Bird of Prey-- 70's driving riff-based number featuring David Byron's very impressive vocal range. Your typical kick-off track to get the adrenaline flowing.<br /><br />2. The Park-- Such a mellow number on track 2? Could easily be redone with lutes and recorders! The whole Renaissance hippie, Hobbit fantasy influence. Actually nears Simon and Garfunkle territory in some of it's vocal arrangements. Get's jazzy halfway through. Progressive rock! Shows imagination and creativity in its odd pairing of styles!<br /><br />3. Time to Live-- another riff-based chug-a-lug number with some really nice change-ups. Ken Hensley's organ swells beautifully in left speaker. Actually, only an average song for this group, in the end going nowhere but to fade out.<br /><br />4. Lady in Black-- absolutely beautiful acoustic-based number with some great imagery in the lyrics. In fact, superb lyrics. A true greatest hits representative. Ah ah ah chorus a little overdone but tolerable (cut down in single version). Only two years after Hey Jude--quite possibly an influence!<br /><br />5. High Priestess-- more from the fantasy camp. Wonderful slide guitar intro. Punchy rocker. Vocal oohs and aahs the highlight for me. Fills out Side A with it's lengthy guitar solo fade out.<br /><br />Side B!<br /><br />6. Salisbury-- If you are a fan of orchestral music and 70s progressive rock, then you may well enjoy one of the all-time classics in rock and roll history! A supreme blend of the Heap sound with orchestral tones, choir, and horn-based rock. A 16-minute masterpiece! Uriah Heep meets Also Sprach Zarathustra (the theme from 2001--A Space Odyssey)! Excessive? No, it works (although at least one critic called it \\"self-indulgent\\"). Hey, Gary Thain was certainly one of the greatest bassists in rock history, competent in jazz as well. Ken Hensley's keyboards are also way up there with the best of rock keyboardists, not far behind Rick Wakeman. Mick Box is a great guitarist with his own sound--not all that common! Finally, you have one of the most beautiful vocalists in rock history in David Byron. It was not odd at all that these guys' expanded the horizons of their musicianship. Certainly better to have done this song than not done at all! If it clicks with you, you'll love it!<br /><br />7. And on the American version, that wasn't all! What followed was one of those minor obscure B-side-type golden nuggets, Simon the Bullet Freak! The ironic thing was this song was not on the U.K. version although it was the truest representation of the U.K. cover art. And it was only further irony that, with Vietnam going on, the U.S. did not use the militaristic U.K. album cover, but, in the spirit of the anti-war movement, included the song which best represented it!<br /><br />Extra CD Tracks:<br />8. Here Am I -- just a typical Heap song. The first half not far from the Bread sound! Heaped up half way through. Nice, but I can see why it was left off the original.<br /><br />9 through 13-- alternate versions and single versions of above songs; at least number 10 (High Priestess) has a bit of digital clipping at the beginning and suffers from erratic compression and obvious edits.<br /><br />The funniest thing is the four minute version of Salisbury (track 11). At this length, put it in the White Rabbit genre? Nice try to promote it I guess. Probably some critics would have preferred this length!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this is great! it does exactly what a calculator should do... it adds, subtracts, multiplies, and even divides!!! that's jus awesome!!!
B00E8KLWB4|1.0|Just one of the &quot;free&quot; games where you have to spend real money for crystals, energy, and stuff like that. You also get the constant nags for Facebook posts which only ends up spamming your friends, and all just for more crystals and energy. Passing and uninstalling.
0385523394|5.0|Bought the book because of this and it is a wonderful story. It has heart and soul and is a terrific memoir. It is the inspiration for the new Netflix TV series. Great read!

I will keep this character in my heart and I hope that other readers will feel the same. Keep writing Nicholas because your books are aimed at the hearts of all.

B009FZHYKU|4.0|Another great season with more twists and turns. The some of the middle episodes were a little stale but over all the season was great!
B007ZXK08C|4.0|Very different, slow to get going but once your into it, it was hard to put down. Lot's of twists and turns and incredibility that someone could be so deceptive and manipulative!
B003QS9WIE|4.0|Very intriguing. the movie kept me guessing on how some of the magic was done. The cast worked well together.
B00AGE20ZI|5.0|The chemistry between Cary Grant, Loretta Young, David Niven, and Monty Wooley is terrific. Wonderful Christmastime story of how an angel (Grant) comes to help a Bishop (Niven) and his wife (Young) during their efforts to finance the building of a cathedral. This is one movie you have got to see.
B000SCHC0Q|3.0|The history search was good but sometimes too long description. I was disappointed with the end. Few parts were very boring.
B001NKI60W|5.0|Who would have thought that Meryl Streep and Pierce Brosnan could sing those wonderful ABBA songs? Meryl actually is quite good and Pierce did a creditible job. But the star of the show are all the wonderful ABBA songs. This is a fun movie - don't miss it.

B000XXGMS8|4.0|I like these timberlands, and they seem to run a tad large, I kept these rather than return them, however, since I tend to wear thick socks with boots. The leather is supple enough out of the box to be comfortable.

B00AB2DNBU|5.0|I was in between getting this edition and the standard blu ray edition, but man am I glad I got this copy! It has beautiful artwork on the front and back and is easily my favorite steelbook. The movie is one of my personal favorites as well and if you haven't seen it, I would definitely recommend watching it. As an evil dead fan who owns the entire series, I would absolutely recommend this edition of Evil Dead!

030746363X|4.0|I enjoyed this book a lot overall, after one year having it.<br /><br />I'll say achieving what the book claims is not exactly easy, but achieving at least some good percentage of the results it claims IS EASY, and results follow after not so much time of implementing the techniques in the book.<br /><br />For instance, after about 2 months of doing the exercise that Ferriss suggests for biceps, this funny anecdote happened to me:<br /><br />A collegue on mine mentioned that my arms and shoulders look bigger, and told me not to do too much exercise, because at this pace I wouldn't find clothes that fit me. I said \\"well... 35 minutes a week is not that much, is it?\\" \\"What? 35 minutes a day?\\", \\"No, 35 minutes a week\\", at this point he begins to freak out, \\"35 minutes a week? That's nothing! No way! What do you do for the arms, for example?\\" \\"10 kg\\" \\"And how many times?\\" \\"16 times each arm\\" \\"3 series of 16?\\" \\"No, one series of 16\\" \\"What?? No way, that's impossible. I must be imagining things!\\" He went away, thinking that his appreciation had been mistaken.<br /><br />The 35 minutes a week refers to the total time exercising including 3 minutes break between exercises, and I am not following the program exactly (I eat less than what Ferriss suggests), what I am doing for arms is gotta be about a total exercising time of 7 minutes per week. Too bad I didn't say that to my colleague :)<br /><br />This book, not being super-revolutionary, I think that is great at encouraging you to try new things.<br /><br />The book also motivated me to learn free-style swimming, a very nice experience!<br /><br />No matter what you think from the style of Tim Ferriss, I believe you can benefit from at least some of the stuff on this book for sure, and if not 100% results, you can achieve 60 or 80% with little effort.<br /><br />Luis
B00A6RCSKC|4.0|For 2 bucks, its a pretty decent game.  Roughly 6 hrs to complete main quest.  Each stage has 2 'challenge' tasks that grant an extra point  to improve abilities.  Personally i would rather have a longer quest line than the challenge stages.
B003X3U8IK|2.0|Saw this same picture disc for a 1/4 of the price on EBAY two weeks after I bought this one.
159463176X|5.0|I didn't think anything could touch The Kite Runner, but this book did not disappoint. A lovely story, with characters that weave a story that touches the heart almost immediately. LOVED IT!
B004ODLUGM|4.0|My wife told me this was originally a book, which I've never read, but I liked the story.  Good background music as well.  My daughters like it and ask to watch it again randomly.  Has some minor scary moments for younger kids but it isn't anything really dramatic, just more of the &#34;what-if&#34; fear than actual scariness.  I would recommend this as short movie for kids to enjoy.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The entire series is a marvel.  The cast is wonderful and the settings are great.  Just finished watching Season 3 and now will have to wait to see what in store for everyone in Season 4.
B00AHTYI5M|4.0|I really enjoyed this one.  I love movies that connect to real-world events in history.  This had some great intense moments that bring you to the end of the movie truly feeling good about what was done on this mission and feeling like there are some good people in governmental positions, which is a tough thought to come by these days.  I actually ended up buying the book that the real Tony Medez wrote because I liked the story and his willingness to stick his neck out there for these people in this dangerous situation.  The only reason this isn't a 5 star is because of all the foul language...was distracting to the story to me.
B003NFM3JK|1.0|It was the same old story, it was not even revised well enough to be enjoyable, it was dry, boring an predictable.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Great movie.  I have watched this movie more in the last year of my life than any other movies combined.  I'm not a huge movie watcher but I could watch this movie over and over again.  Love the story, the characters, the action...its awesome.  I ended up buying the other movies that are connected to it as well.  (Thor, Iron Man 1 & 2, & Captain America) Love the movie, would recommend it to anyone.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|Once Jack Reacher was known to lovers of the books of Lee Child now he is known but not always beloved by everyone. Jack is one tough cookie and he is always getting into brawls and solving mysteries and setting things right. He is a true white knight and his horse is either his hitch hiking thumb or the local bus.Tom Cruise was not nearly tall enough or brawny to fit the part but he carried it off with his sheer excellent acting skills.
B001JRB16U|5.0|Watched this as a child and loved it.  I got this for my daughters to grow up watching because of the fun and fantasy of it.  Mary Poppins is a must have in my opinion.  Great overall experience.
B00CL6HGIK|5.0|This movie was so well done that I started looking for more Mark Wahlberg pieces. The movie is gripping with surprising twists and turns.
B003INBNXO|5.0|I've watched kung fu and Bruce Lee movies for about 25 years and this movie ranks up there as one of the best.  I love the quickness and attitude Donnie Yen brings to the character.  The fight scenes with him involved are must see.  If you enjoy Kung Fu movies, you will love this one.
B00B78AIV0|5.0|This novel depicts the lives of a family of Catholics living in Africa. The father is strict and his children must abide by his harsh rules. They are not allowed to spend time with other family members unless they too are practicing Catholics. The paternal grandfather is a pagan so the family rarely sees him. The story escalates and the family falls apart due to tragedy. The story casts the 2 children into the home of their paternal aunt where they find that life can be very different but rewarding as well. This is truly a lovely story and I love learning about this culture.
0439023521|3.0|It's a pretty good book, and definitely interesting, but I only bought it because I like to read while traveling and I had a few trips coming up and decided to buy a few books. If you're a teen/pre-teen, I think you'll love it, but I'm 20 and kind of picky with books, so it wasn't my cup of tea.

B0000073I5|5.0|Mike Rutherford with help of former Genesis member Anthony Phillips put together THE best work of Mike Rutherford. Mike and Anthony were both in a band together called the Anon before they joined Genesis. If you put Anthony Phillips'' [[ASIN:B006TGY7LC Sides]]  and Noel McCalla's 1979 \\"Night Time Emotion\\" album(for some reason it's not on amazon but it does exist) you'd have a prequel album to Smallcreep's Day. It's shame it was never toured for however, there is a live version of \\"Out Into The Daylight\\" from an Italian band called \\"Elio e le Storie Tese\\" from The Lugano Tapes.
B001MTENOC|1.0|I think this guy is really out there and should be locked up is what I think. Number one, I have been under hypnosis before and it is nothing like he describes here. This book is like this movie, it is all make believe in order to make the bucks and claim some fame which he isn't.
B000TERIW0|5.0|Steve Hackett, Mike Rutherford, Phil Collins, and a few others put together this great lost Genesis album. Phil sings on Star of Sirius and it sounds like a Wind and Wuthering track. The whole album sound as if Genesis albums [[ASIN:B001R6KCIG Trespass]] and [[ASIN:B0044AAB9M Wind & Wuthering [2007 Remaster] [+video]]] were put together. You can hear it in Blood on The Rooftops. Steve Hackett beat his successor Anthony Phillips to the punch on [[ASIN:B0030C8OIK Geese And The Ghost]] that also used Mike Rutherford and Phil Collins. In a 1987 MTV interview with Tony Banks, he stated that this album didn't do much for Genesis, I strongly disagree!

0142000655|5.0|This was a book chosen by a member of my book club.  I enjoyed reading it and our discussion of it was very lively. It is a long book but it kept my interest.  I am interested in reading other books by John Steinbeck.  Glad to know a classic was a good read!

B00CW7KK9K|5.0|New info added April 22, 2014<br /><br />Before you buy a Withings Pulse, you should know about the new Withings \\"Pulse O2\\" which is just now hitting the store shelves.<br /><br />The Pulse O2 appears to be a new version of the Pulse.  But it's actually identical to the original Pulse with a wrist-band holder added.  The Pulse O2 retails for $20 more than the Pulse, and you can buy the wrist-band holder separately for $15 (directly from Withings, and probably from Amazon before long).<br /><br />The Pulse O2 has the ability to measure your blood oxygen level.  But so does the original Pulse after you download the latest firmware update.  This new feature uses the same hardware as the original Pulse--the sensor on the back of the device where you place your finger to measure your heart rate.<br /><br />The Pulse O2 comes with a wrist-band holder.  You can slide the Pulse into it and wear it like a wrist-band style tracker, such as the Fitbit Flex and Jawbone UP.  But please note:  the Pulse is not as water-resistant as other wrist-trackers, so you must take it off when showering or when jogging or cycling in the rain.<br /><br />Also, note that in order to use the heart rate or O2 sensor, you must take the Pulse out of the wrist-band holder so that you can place your figure on the sensor on the back of the device.  In other words, you don't get real-time heart rate monitoring with the Pulse.  (But to be fair, most other trackers in this price range don't measure heart rate or O2 levels at all.)<br /><br />Again, the only difference between the original Pulse and the Pulse O2 is the O2 costs $20 more but includes a wrist band holder that's available separately for $15.  I recommend buying the original Pulse instead of the O2 and saving $20.  You can always get the wrist band holder later if you want.<br /><br />My original review follows:<br />----<br /><br />I'm a big fan of activity trackers.  After buying my first one, an original Fitbit when they first came out, I started paying attention to how much walking I was doing, which motivated me to walk more.  I upgraded to a Fitbit One when they came out, and loved it.  Now I have a Withings Pulse.  If you're trying to choose between them, you can't go wrong with either, the similarities outweigh the differences.  But there are some differences, I think the Pulse is a little better, on balance.<br /><br />Both of these activity trackers use accelerometers and altimeters to track your steps and elevation gain, and both provide rough estimates of calories burned and distance traveled.  Both can be used to track your sleep (albeit somewhat crudely and inaccurately).  Both are tiny and easy to wear (and to lose, if you're not careful!).  Both allow syncing to smartphones via bluetooth.<br /><br />Reasons why I like the Pulse better:<br /><br />The Pulse has better battery life:  I'm getting 11-12 days between charges, with frequent syncing and pulse checking.  With the Fitbit, I never got more than 6 days  from a charge.  (UPDATE:  My first full charge with the Pulse lasted 11 days.  My second lasted 15 days.  I think this is because during the first week, I was checking the display and/or syncing with my iPhone very frequently because the Pulse was new and novel.)<br /><br />The Pulse can measure your heart rate, the Fitbit cannot.  It's easy to do, though you have to press the button a few times to get to the heart rate screen and then touch the heart icon on the screen in order to activate the feature.  The readings are accurate in my experience--I compared them to the readings taken at about the same time from a drug store blood pressure cuff and also my Withings BP cuff.<br /><br />This feature is important to me.  Your resting heart rate is an important indicator of your level of cardiovascular fitness, and for most people the Pulse will be their only gadget to regularly measure (as well as track over time) their heart rate.<br /><br />The Pulse's altimeter is a little more accurate than Fitbit's.  It only counts elevation gain when it also senses that you're walking, so it won't count elevator/escalator rides.<br /><br />With the latest firmware update, the Pulse can display data from the last couple of days, not just the current day, so you can see how many more steps you need to take to beat yesterday's total.<br /><br />You'll need to use the Withings health mate app on your smartphone to initially set up your Pulse, update its firmware, and of course track your measurements over time.  I think the app is perfectly adequate but I'm not crazy about it.  It shows all the information it collects from the Pulse, and shows neat graphs of your measurements over time, and more.  I already had the Withings scale and blood pressure monitor, which use the same app.<br /><br />The Withings app connects with lots of other fitness apps to share each other's data.  I've connected my Withings app with MyFitnessPal (for tracking food consumption) and RunKeeper (for tracking my bicycle rides and jogs).  There are some apps it doesn't work with, such as MapMyRide, my preferred bike ride tracking app.  But it works with many apps, and more are added every few months.  The Withings app also works with competitors' apps, like FitBit and Jawbone UP, so you could get a FitBit One or FitBit Flex and use it with the Withings app (though not sure why you'd want to do this, unless you already have the Withings scale or BP cuff).  The extent of integration and information sharing with external apps varies from app to app; it might be that your favorite app can import just a little of the data collected by the Withings app, or vice versa.<br /><br />The Fitbit has one feature the Pulse lacks:  you can set an alarm and the Fitbit will vibrate when the alarm goes off.  I never used this, but some people find it helpful.  A friend must sleep with ear plugs (her husband snores), so she can't hear her alarm clock in the morning; the vibrating FitBit alarm is therefore really handy for her.<br /><br />On the negative side, the Pulse's display in direct bright sunlight is very faint and almost impossible to read.<br /><br />Another negative for some people:  you MUST have a compatible device with Bluetooth 4.0 to setup and to sync the Pulse.  Compatible devices include most Android phones and iPhones/iPads/iPod touches released in the past few years.  It doesn't sync with Blackberries, Windows phones, certain older Android phones, or even computers.  The Fitbit One can sync with computers (using a tiny USB dongle that comes with the Fitbit) or with a smartphone with Bluetooth 4.0.<br /><br />This is a dealbreaker for people without the right gear.  So, please check that your phone or tablet is compatible before buying.<br /><br />If you DO have a compatible smartphone or device, the setup and syncing in my experience work perfectly (though after browsing other reviews, I see a few people have had some issues).<br /><br />The Pulse syncs with your smartphone/device periodically, maybe 3-4 times a day.  If you want to see up-to-the-minute data on your smartphone, you can force a sync by long-pressing the button; this works fine.<br /><br />Whenever the Pulse syncs with your device, the data is automatically uploaded to your Withings account in the cloud, and you can then view it at my.withings.com.  This is useful if your phone has a small screen, and you'd rather see the data on a bigger display.<br /><br />I've tried the sleep monitoring with the Pulse and the Fitbit One.  I have sleep apnea so I was particularly interested in this feature.  I think the Pulse and Fitbit One are not especially accurate at measuring sleep time or quality.  But, if you track your sleep regularly over time, you can see the trends, which can be helpful.  Just don't expect too much.<br /><br />Bottom line:  If you're trying to decide between the Fitbit One and Withings Pulse, I recommend the Pulse (as long as you have a compatible smartphone--check thisfirst!).  If you already have a Withings scale or blood pressure cuff (both of which are excellent in my opinion), it's a no-brainer.<br /><br />Yet, I think the Fitbit One is also very good, and does almost everything the Pulse does; at the moment I'm writing this, Amazon has the Fitbit on sale (it's normally the same price as the Pulse).<br /><br />If you already have a Fitbit, it's probably not worth buying the Pulse unless you really need the integrated heart rate monitor.<br /><br />If you're trying to decide between the Pulse and a wrist-band type tracker, like the Jawbone UP or Fitbit Flex, I can't help you--I haven't tried those. The wrist band format is great for some folks, but not for me.<br /><br />---<br />UPDATE October 2013:<br /><br />I've had this for a few months now and wanted to address a couple issues that keep popping up in the negative reviews.<br /><br />1) Defects.  I haven't had any problems; all functions of the Pulse work as advertised for me.  But it looks like a fair number of people have had problems with syncing, or the heart-rate feature not working, or other issues.  It's possible that there's a higher-than-normal defect rate.  I'd urge anyone considering this product to purchase from a retailer--like Amazon--that has an excellent no-questions-asked return policy of at least 30 days.  It is not at all uncommon for the earliest production run of a brand new product to have a higher than normal defect rate, which gets ironed out in subsequent production runs.  So I expect that, going forward, the defect rate will be lower and most people will get perfectly functioning units.  But still, be safe and make sure you get a 30 or more day return policy.<br /><br />2) Accuracy.  My Pulse is \\"reasonably\\" accurate.  Sure, there are days when it shows much more or much less steps/distance than I've actually covered, and nights when it shows I'm asleep when I know I was awake.  But when I look at the long-run trends on the Withings Health-Mate app or the withings website, they look pretty accurate.  I've had two previous fitbit units, and the same was true with them.  These activity trackers all work pretty much the same way, and are not going to be perfectly accurate on any given day; where they're useful in my opinion is seeing patterns and trends.  Now, a few folks here report their Pulse (or their Fitbit) is wildly inaccurate every day, like showing they climbed 50 floors when they sat at their desk most of the day.  That sounds like a defect.  Send it back for a new one (if you're within the return period--and if you have a defective unit, you're likely to see the problems within the first 30 days).  My point here is that we should have reasonable and realistic expectations about what these little gadgets can do for us.  For some people, the accuracy (of a non-defective unit) is not good enough; fine, send it back.  But I think the fitness trackers in this price class provide highly useful and motivating information when used daily over time.<br /><br />3) Heart-rate feature.  Some people expect that the Pulse can constantly monitor their heart rate during exercise, like a Polar heart rate chest strap / wristwatch monitor.  It cannot.  The Pulse will measure and record your heart rate if you push the little button a bunch of times then put your finger on the back.  I consider it best for taking your resting heart rate a couple times a week, and seeing how this changes over time as you get more fit.  If you want real-time heart rate monitoring during exercise, a very reasonable thing to want, then the Pulse is not the right product for you.<br /><br />*  *  *<br /><br />Still happy with my Pulse after all these months.  But, I've ordered a new Fitbit Force, which should arrive in a few weeks.  Looking forward to comparing them.really handy for her.<br /><br />On the negative side, the Pulse's display in direct bright sunlight is very faint and almost impossible to read.<br /><br />Another negative for some people:  you MUST have a compatible device with Bluetooth 4.0 to setup and to sync the Pulse.

B000GCFO0I|5.0|This movie gets to the heart of the matter dealing with the over zealous religious cults that can do more harm than good....for the good of man....lol.
B00BZAJMWG|5.0|. . .and again and again. The performances are so unbelievably believable. I'm glad we didn't watch any trailers. Think it would have taken some edge off the outrageousness.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Although some of the things mentioned were hard to believe, this was a very good read.  Our Book Club had a lively discussion of the different ideas this book brought up.
B00APPJQ0U|5.0|Another one of those films that is so fun/pathetic/wonderful/sad to come back to over and over. Would love to have seen what the day-to-day production was like. I can only imagine it was wonderfully totally exhausting.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is challenging and fun at the same time.<br />It lets kids like me learn skill and other cool stuff like money I give it five stars for how fun it is! :D
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|One of those films we will watch many times over the years. I'm sure with each viewing we will continue to find subtleties in the performances that help make this such a complete production.
1934030597|5.0|Good book, easy to read. No photographs which to me, is not an issue. I prefer the schematic style sketches.<br />If your new to the sport, this is a good way to learn how to maintain you bike, before spending time/money at your LBS. And from my experience, you will always do a more thorough job than your LBS.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|More fun than Temple Run and you get Minions. Got it for free but would have happily paid for it.
B000A6EXNO|4.0|Easy to install, helps with view finder viewing. Not a mandatory, but personal preference whether you need this or not.
B00BGV0Y26|4.0|Good stuff from the band. Lots of hard stuff and even some soft tracks. 'In Your Room' strikes me as a bit creepy in a Mrs Robinson kind of way
B005NPLXJ4|1.0|Save yourself the time and effort and dont bother with this album. In fact, if you should even see a copy lying around, run. Run very fast. And get it as far away from you as you possibly can. An absolute train wreck of an album. You would wonder how garbage like this ever got recorded, never mind released. Truly one of the worst albums I've ever, ever heard.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|A powerful ending to a great trilogy. Hard to put down once you pick it up. Would like to thank the author for a wonderful story.
B008JFUO0Y|2.0|Let me start by saying, I'm a big horror fan, and a big fan of the original \\"Evil Dead\\" trilogy. Unfortunately, as a remake, this new Evil Dead doesn't live up to the original, and as a stand alone, it doesn't stand up to other recent horror movies.<br /><br />On the good side, the Blu-Ray looks fantastic, the image is crystal clear, the audio is superb, and the presentation is top notch.<br /><br />On the bad side, almost everything else. The story is fairly bland, save for a halfway interesting sub-plot involving a girl trying to detox. While most of the actors are able to hold their own, they aren't given particularly interesting dialog. Every character is bland and one dimensional. The story is very straightforward, to the point where I could predict what was going to happen well in advance.  Now, I realize most people don't go to horror movies for the intriguing plots, but even as horror stories go, this one was boring. Because I didn't connect with or care about a single character, I also didn't care if they lived or died, which significantly softens the blow when they do invariably die. Another mechanic that took away the element of surprise was the book, known as the \\"Necronomicon\\" (which I don't think they actually said in this version), that had pictures of each death before it happened. It really took away from the suspense and surprise when 5 minutes before a death, you'd see a page from the book with an illustration depicting the death about to happen. This happened with EVERY death, literally telegraphing the scares and thus negating them. Even with poor story and characters, a horror movie can redeem itself by being scary, and this one simply isn't.<br /><br />It is, however, gory as all heck. There is no shortage of blood, gore, vomit, and in one case, bloody gore-vomit. If this sounds nauseating, it is. The special effects are well done, and rely on practical effects rather than CGI, which was a good choice. Unfortunately, aside from having nice gore effects, there is nothing else positive I can say about Evil Dead. I watched this alone, in the pitch-black dark, with headphones on for maximum effect and instead of scaring me, I wound up laughing quite a bit at the sheer ridiculousness of it all. To be fair, the original Evil Dead sometimes fell into the \\"so-campy-its-funny\\" camp, but the original was highly entertaining and had soul. This one is just dull.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|Finally an app that I can use on my Kindle for a hidden object game!  I love it!  I really hope to find more like this.  The best part is that this one was free!
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|Like being able to play against friends on Facebook on my Kindle Fire. Liked the tutorial.  A couple of features I wasn't aware of before tutorial.  As easy or easier than on my computer!<br />My 4 year old grandson is happy I now have games on my Fire.
1476734941|3.0|no new information.<br />a little boring<br />it's more of a coockbook than an informational or educational one<br />i passed it along to a friend
B004W1GCQO|2.0|This show has its good and not so good moments. The characters development is a bit rough, the plot line all over the place, and in general the acting seems forced. Couldn't make it past the first half of season 1.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It is awesome your little one of topgear behind school ers to have a bullet points and i watched the stig and away from home
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|Simple, fun to play, cute animation. Nice for the casual gamer. Kids will love it. Great that it's free to play.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is one of the best bingo games I have played in a long time keep up the good work
B0096I9UTE|5.0|I have been quite the Kylie Minogue fan for quite some time. She is one of those artists that I always purchase albums from without even sampling them. Then came this one. I am always hesitant when it comes to remixes. They're usually just computer generated alternative versions of the same song cut together just well enough to be decent at best. This cd is nothing like it. If you are a fan of Kylie, you will love this cd. If not, you will love this cd. It's as if Kylie herself wanted to take fans on an interesting and expressive journey through her music, both old and new, as she put her own artistic take to each song. Every song had a meaning, a very intimate one, and a story. No need for a boring narrative, though. Her emotions and talents pour through each song, making you love them all again but for the first time. \\"Never Too Late\\" and \\"On A Night Like This\\" are my favorite two songs, and they are simply magnificent.  If you like Kylie Minogue at all, you simply MUST own this album. My only complaint with this album is that it ends. I hope there is a part two to this, maybe include songs like \\"Please Stay\\", \\"Stars\\", \\"Cosmic\\", \\"Everything Is Beautiful\\", and other favorites by her.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Just started but so far looks like a good game. Sometimes, some objects are a bit difficult to spot as they are somewhat small. Otherwise, graphics look good, gameplay easy enough to learn, especially if your familiar with HOGs.
B000P407K4|4.0|Very fun movie, clasic comedy of the nucular age. One of those movies I used to stay up late just to watch.

B008JFURII|5.0|The film incorporates Wikileaks as the new problem child for Moses Frank (Bruce Willis) and company. An article claims he and Marvin (John Malkovich) were involved in a 1979 operation called \\"Night Shade.\\" They have become wanted men.<br /><br />In an expanded role Sarah (Mary-Louise Parker) our meek lady from Kansas has become a thrill seeker and joins the group as they travel the world to find \\"Night Shade.\\" In addition to Interpol and the Feds looking for our heroes, there is also a hitman (Byung-hun Lee) after them and Victoria (Helen Mirren) is also contracted to kill them...Malkovich proclaims \\"Friends don't take out a contract on friends.\\"  They are allied by KGB agent Katja (Catherine Zeta-Jones) to the displeasure of sweet innocent Sarah who says...\\"Can't we just kill her?\\"<br /><br />The film is filled with Malkovich one liners which we enjoyed in the first movie. The expanded role of Sarah added to the feature. This is perhaps a notch below the first installment, but a worthy action-comedy sequel that will be in my collection when it comes out.<br /><br />Parental Guide: No sex or nudity. One half spoken f-bomb.
B000ULQV6G|5.0|All of ya'll critics should just shut up.  Mr. West is a \\"love hate\\" artist.  None of his albums are identical, which is good!  He tries to find new stuff.  His lyrics are strong with his first 4 albums.  YOU CAN TELL that he is changing throughout career.  His lyrics start talking about partying and nightlife, no substance.  Hopefully he will comeback lyric wise...  his beats are tight but he seems to be trying to CONSTANTLY change, of course because industry pressure.  Relax Mr. West... you don't need to.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|this game is fun but it is taking up to much application space and wont stop downloading a whole bunch of new crape that is using up my megabites.

B007CVZE38|5.0|I just bought this album on vinyl and discovered that Amazon gives you the high-quality MP3's for free! I love listening to music on vinyl, but there's no feasible way to \\"rip\\" it to your computer. Problem solved!<br /><br />I was a little worried when it said that it came with the MP3's for free, and that it would go into my Amazon Cloud player. I pretty much assumed that's where they would live forever; however, the very first thing it does is tell you how to download them to use on whatever you want, DRM free. So fear not, you get high-quality MP3s with your purchase on the vinyl, and probably the CD as well. I don't think you get them for free if you just purchase the MP3s, but that doesn't require a degree in rocket science; just a third grade education, which most people on the internet have obtained.<br /><br />Enjoy this awesome album that's great to relax to immediately, while you wait 1-2 days to listen to the warm soothing sounds of vinyl.
B000I3PA8Q|5.0|Completely entertaining.  The best of the Star Trek movies.  Strong characters, a good story, and many humorous moments not often found in science fiction.

B00CWV8TIU|4.0|Keeps you guessing, but the end is somewhat unbelievable.  A very different role for Catherine Zeta-Jones, who is still as sexy as ever.
B006GLM5EQ|3.0|Not a bad show I've heard it gets better so going to watch next season to see if it actually does
B0092ZEIN4|5.0|I really didn't know what to expect when I ordered this for my Samsung S4 phone and my modified Android NOOK Color.<br /><br />Everything was breeze.  Easy to charge and quick to link up with both items via Bluetooth.<br /><br />I mainly use this for Retro game apps which run MAME, Sega Genesis, NES, SNES and others.  The Playpad works great if you have a break at work, even if you need to pass the time on a road trip or just to kill off an hour of time.<br /><br />My apps allowed me to program the buttons without any Nyko app.  Please note this may be different for other popular games, but if these little apps work fine with the controller, I don't see why some of the more advanced games would have a problem.<br /><br />This also is a great controller for anyone not looking to be directly connected to your phone.  The controller allows you to sit back and view your tablet or phone from a comfortable distance.<br /><br />The only thing would be it might be a small controller and it can cause a slight cramp if played for an extended time.<br /><br />The controller comes with a carrying case and with a stand for your phone or tablet.  Both are handy for being on the go or just sitting up for home use.<br /><br />Since there really isn't a large amount of Bluetooth controllers, this would be a solid choice for the money.  I was able to get it for about $25.00 and I'm pleased with the results.
0515142247|1.0|This is the first book of the series I have read after it was suggested by Amazon as being like Richard Crais's books.  Lee Child is not a terrible writer but the plot, characters, motivation all lack substance.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|since the upgrade on my kindle fire it opens and sticks on loading when the tip pops up at the beggining. can you guys help? or please fix?<br />I miss playing.<br /><br />ive already tried deleting and redownloading. also tried shutting off the kindle and turning it back on.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|Good Game thanks it is exactly what I wanted worth the money and or coins word word word word words
B005IQ5H7M|4.0|I have read a lot of Vonnegut books, this one is pretty good.  But so are the others.  My favorite still goes to Cats cradle.
B0064MGU98|3.0|I watched the premier episode where the husband goes to jail after his wife slaps him. Then the wife gets a tryout with a law firm and the plot turns into an episode of Perry Mason - except Perry Mason now wears a skirt. The female Perry Mason even has a private investigator sidekick but that character is also in a skirt. There is even that Perry Mason moment that all lawyers lust for but never find where the principle witness confesses that he lied and the case is won. BTW I watched this on my computer and it was a really bad experience. The picture would freeze while the sound continued or the sound would drop while the picture juddered and bounced then the whole thing would get in sync and then not and then freeze and so on. I need to try using my TV to see if this prime TV service is any better. I hope so.
193700788X|5.0|This book met all my expectations! Perfect ending to the series! The only bad thing is that there won't be any more. Long live Sookie!
159420411X|5.0|If you are into politics this is an interesting read. The book describes how to differentiate between meaningless noise and useful information.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I just loved the book! I can't wait to read it again. Colleen Hoover is amazing arthur.  Best storey I have read in a while.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is a fun game love the zip line heeded yeeeeeee yeeeeee yeeeeeeeee is what I say when I go the zip line
B0074MTTEK|5.0|I started reading this book before I took an online introduction to epigenetics class and it has been a great compliment to my understanding. The class I'm taking does not have the neurological information that the book has. I'm just completely hooked on this subject and I'm greatly anticipating more discovery and more great books like The Epigenetic Revolution.
B00AALX5SI|5.0|I already liked Katy Perry but after seeing the movie I really liked her even more. I felt sorry for her she tried her hardest to make her marriage work. She traveled so much to see him and it never said he did the same and she was touring so she had to be exhausted. I respect that she tried so hard. I also liked how committed she is to her fans. Seems down to earth.
B00992CF6W|1.0|Its so hard to get children off this game it is almost mind bending, my kids change after palying, they fight alot and so we are going to get ride of it. A few of my friends say the same thing about thier kids. It changes them and it drives them to be nasty when they cant turn it off. Almost seems brain washing we are all done with it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this is the best game that I ever played buy it now.I needed a really good game to play and I found this one and I love it.I want to have se x with it and my minion has a baby dustiness on so cute.Buy this games right now.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|We like games like this, they are a lot of fun:) Thats all I have to say for now, bye!
0375413405|5.0|Sorry I could not resist. An awesome cookbook from a master chef and an awesome lady. Used several recipes already. French cooking is so wonderful
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Loved the acting as well as the storyline. Enjoyed learning about this period in history while watching a good drama.
B001O1O71C|4.0|It's very sad to remember these things happen, but we must!<br />We must make sure this never does happen again.
B00AESN8XY|4.0|Ok, this game is a little sick and twisted.  You play a bacteria or virus that infects humans and the goal is to kill everyone in the world.  But, I actually find it to be educational.  I now know more about bacterial mutations and communicability than I ever thought I would.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|this was my 1st hiking adventure book.  I really enjoyed it.  I'm now on my 4th book about hiking the long trails.
B00BLGXL3U|4.0|After the first 45 minutes of this film, I thought I was watching a masterpiece.  Phoenix's performance is insanely good and completely believable, and Hoffman -- who is usually extremely good -- actually struggles to keep up with him, but does manage to at least be his equal.  And then, somewhere, about half way through, the story becomes muddled and the main thread seems to get lost.  Phoenix and Hoffman continue doing the best they can with the material, but the scenes seem heavily edited and the actors wind up singing a tune with only one or two notes, which can't be sustained over the long run without becoming boring.  I was left feeling unsatisfied, mostly because it started out with so much promise.  Watch the first hour, then turn it off and make up your own ending.  It will probably be better than what you would have seen in the second hour and a half.
B00C33M2EE|5.0|The music is great, but you have to watch the videos too! This is full of favorites: \\"All of Me\\", \\"Mission Impossible\\", \\"Rockabel Canon\\", and \\"Peanuts\\" are a few that come immediately to mind.  Some videos are funny, but \\"Nearer my God to Thee\\" is both reverent and majestic.    I wish they had a DVD of their first collection too.    This is one thing my young one can put on repeat and we still love listening to it hours later.
B005IQ39AY|5.0|I love it.  I play it all the time. I played this game when I was little on the super Nintendo. My kids love playing also.
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|I love this game im so addicted to it i play it several times a day but i need active neighbors please add me my farm id is DVQGMPH only thing is they need to fix the facebook error.im glad the crops never wilt.if you like farming games you will like this game.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|This movie was better than I expected. Very touching, which was very unexpected. The minions were really cute and entertaining.
B009PNQUXO|2.0|Won't work after I download idk why but it does. That is why I only gave it 2 stars<br /><br />Bizzare...
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I really enjoy the game plays differently than temple run, but very enjoyable and entertaining! My new favorite game, and I love the minions!
B003V4AK8E|4.0|This controller is awesome! It came to my house expected and so far, I have no problems with. It's better and cheaper than buying a cross adapter that allows cross controller compatibility (Example: XBOX 360 controller on PS3), since it is shaped like a 360 controller. It was only about $19 plus tax (about $25, depends where you live). The only problem I had was that it's not that good for FPS games, but overall, I would recommend this product to anybody that is not like a FPS type gamer, otherwise I can honestly say that this is one of the best controllers for PS3 available! Oh, and the buttons light up as well!
B001KZG99A|5.0|YOU MUST WATCH THIS MOVIE WITH SURROUND SOUND SYSTEM IN ORDER TO ENJOY IT. DURING THE MOVIE. IT SHOW TOO MANY FLASH IMAGE LIKE SOMEONE USING A STROLL LIGHT
B008Z9L94O|1.0|I thought it was vinyl and CDS, and now I do not know what to do!!!<br />I would have passed it back!
B000AY74OG|4.0|This was purchased from a wishlist as a gift for grandchildren.  They love it and it is frequently revisited, or so I am told.
B00DUCXFUC|1.0|Pretty sure this collection exists for 33$ already... minus the fancy packaging and extras. It does look pretty neat but considering that it doesn't have anything that the fans should already have... I don't think it's worth shelling out 70$ for packaging. Maybe if it was 40$ MAYBE!
B005QPGHQU|5.0|This is yet another great album from this fantastic band. The song \\"My Heart is Broken\\" is simply outstanding and if fact partly inspired the ending to my novel \\"Get Emily\\" - which you will find here on Amazon: [[ASIN:1490505156 Get Emily (As Darkness Descends) (Volume 2)]]<br /><br />I must confess I've listed more to this album than any other over recent months and the above track especially.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This game is awesome no glitches and u go hunting too... I Recommend it to people....I'm all like HEY PEAPLEZ THIS GAME IS AWESOME :)
B004Y1USV2|4.0|After a long ten years since their last new material, quite sadly their original singer and song writer Jon Anderson, cannot do the long intense Tours this band and its music demands. They found a great singer in Beniot David who helped pull the band back on the road and back in the Studio. This CD is a wonderful reflection of the fact that the remaining members can produce great Music. I saw them perform most of this CD on Tour in 2011. Sadly Benoit David, had to leave the band for personal reason's.<br />YES struck gold with a new singer Jon Davison, he finished off promoting this CD on the Road in 2012.......and now they are on Tour as I write this playing Three of their classic Albums. On Fly from Here, you get a really good taste of what is coming from this mostly British Band. Into the Storm, Hour of Need and Solitaire is worth the price alone. The six part \\"Fly from Here\\" song takes you on a journey, like most of their music.....they don't go for pop hits, but music you play and listen to, music that must be experienced, not just heard. YES has a big following across the Planet, and although their older 1970's music is still extremely popular, if you want a YES album to begin with buy three, The YES Album, Fragile, and Close to the Edge. You will be hooked, mind you, this is YES and you must listen to the music completely, then move on through the YES journey and by all means buy Fly from Here. There is NO bad YES album, some are beyond description, \\"Going for the One\\" has a song on it called \\"Awaken\\"........if you get a chance to see them live and they play that song, along with \\"And you and I\\" you will be hooked and understand all the other music......including Fly from Here.........
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Ok. It's DC comics which they tell you up front. But Bruce Willis and Morgan Freeman have so much fun mugging for the camera it's a fun romp in shoot em up, blow em up. No brain er, Saturday night fun. Enjoy. Mary-Louise Parker is hilarious....&#34;pizza&#34; through duct tape...Cracked me up.
B005LAII8K|4.0|I just watched Looper in both standard HD and Blu-ray to try and determine if it would be worth replacing some of my DVD collection with Blu-ray. IMO Blu-ray may have looked somewhat better but, no where good enough for me to swap Dvd's.  I did enjoy the movie though.
B001V7YWTQ|5.0|The set list is incredible and the audio is pristine for a rock concert. Highly pleased with this purchase. It's really a no-brainer. Do you like Eric Clapton's guitar/vocals/songs? Do you like Traffic and Steve Winwood? Then get off your duffs and buy this CD and transport yourself to a time of fine rock songwriting.
B008XG1X18|4.0|LOVE IT . IT IS SO FUN I LOVE I  IT IS VERY FUN AND IS ALSO ALOT LIKE TUBLIR  LOV  THIS APP IT IS SO FREE AND IS SO FUN
B002PEP4U0|5.0|William Kamkwamba exemplifies the possibilities of human spirit & ingenuity. Like a good inventor, he fashioned a brilliant work-around when poverty and famine forced him to drop out of school. Instead, he found his own route to education. His success changed the fortunes of his village and, we hope, of Africa.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Minions are awesome and hilarious and humorous and popular and has good characters This game is very exciting I love it
B003UYUR0G|4.0|I am a big fan of the game franchise, and I just like this movie. They do take some creative license with characters and the story, and it's not life changing by any means but it looks beautiful and it is a fun movie you can turn your brain off for.
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|This could have been so much more.  Don't waste your time or money as I did.  Yawn!  Acting not good, story worse and special effects nothing special.
B004FQX5CK|5.0|Looks great of course, and the movie is as good as it ever was. What else is there to say?
1577311523|4.0|book great condition just a hard read hard to follow.  i have ten words or more this is a bulling tatted Thx U
B00C2IN7EE|4.0|Of course it's the same movie in lovely blu-ray. I quite like this unique packaging, it's a nice change from the normal one.
B000VUCIZO|1.0|I bought this book because I read the book about Steve Jobs (excellent book), and I wanted to read Wozniak's point of view. He is incredibly arrogant and comes across as kind of a nut-job. It seems like he wrote this book himself, and never had a real writer proof read it for him. Throughout the book he repeats himself several times, and basically tells a couple of stories more than once. It is very obvious why Jobs was the one to take Apple to the heights of success, and not Wozniak. He sounds like a sniveling little girl who can't handle the fact that Jobs got the recognition for Apple's successful products.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Love the humor, but it doesn't get in the way of a great plot.  This is the first DeMille and John Corey I've read but now I'm going to go find all his others.  Action and suspense are plentiful, location based on current events make this plot very believable.  A great read!
B004UNX1LS|3.0|I used to enjoy listening to my Vevo videos, but not I have to watch Justin Beber perfume commercials between every song. I don't mind commercials every few songs but every song is ridiculous!
B00AWBNNAG|5.0|it's got every kind of instruction they've ever had. Very helpful! I use it all the time. Awesome . .
B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|Loved it the first time I saw it and even more so with out advertisement. Watching all 10 season from 1st to last.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|i have read all of Hosseinis', this one was as wonderful as the last.  He has the ability to pull you into the novel and truly learning and appreciating every character.  It was a great read, I look forward to the next
B008JFUNYG|4.0|First of all if you saw this in theaters...it's not the theatrical version... They cut out a few things from the theatrical version before they released it to DVD... Overall I loved it. Great acting, great 21st century reinvention...and Bruce Campbell produced it!!! If your looking for a great gore/scare flick this should be on your list of movies then to check out.. Hopefully they will release an unrated version soon with all the stuff back in it.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|can't wait for another one of her books to come out! It had me on the edge the whole time.
B00BQI4AU6|5.0|I have been a fan of Cinderella since 1990... Always loved Toms voice and the sound of the music... This album is plain great!!!! It's rock, it's country, it's all you could ever want in a good rock album... Toms musical influences are shown throughout the whole album.. It's a great road album, or just a sit back and relax album... It's good to see Tom back to doing what he does best!!
B00EAI9CSY|5.0|Great movie, great story, great cast! \\"Interview with the Vampire\\" all over again! Saoirse Ronan was scary and lovely at the same time.
B00CDUVDEC|5.0|From start to finish this album kills. Phil sounds better then ever!!! He's back where he is supposed to be... Right at the top with the other legendary singers past and present... It's not pantera, it's not superjoint ritual, it's just straight PHIL ANSELMO!!! Each Song you can tell is straight from the heart and just pure and heavy!!! His finest hour is right here!!! Buy it without regret!!
B003Q6D2BE|3.0|This is a review of the product. The movie itself is one of my favorites blending action and comedy I highly reccomend watching. As for the Blu-Ray, nothing special about the special features you can listen to real CIA agents talking about real life CIA stuff. If you can get it for less then $15 I would say get this over the DVD, but either one brings you a great movie.
B00DGXGUSY|5.0|I have been a fan of Amon Amarth long into their Scum years... This is a band that has come a long way to be where they are.. Surtur Rising ( their last release) was the first time I was disappointed in them.. I guess every band has that one \\"st anger\\" album that totally sucks... After hearing their newest offering, I feel they have totally redeemed themselves all the way.. This album brings me back to their earlier material.. It's raw, melodic and heavy as hell.. The way pure death metal is supposed to be. It reminds me of The sound that \\"fate of Norns\\" had... My advice... Buy this album... You will not be disappointed at all... They're back and better then ever!!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is awesome and u have to get th  update and sometimes it doesn't work without internet and that the people in the game are like it in the movie and its just the best game I ever played its like it in the movie
B004MC8CA2|3.0|I don't like that I can't underline just certain parts in the verse I have to underline or highlight the whole verse. I also don't that when they give us connecting verses I can't click on them. Why give them to me if it can't direct me to them. Lastly vocabulary. Why can't i click on a word and a definition pops up. When I'm reading a book on my kindle I can click a word and the definition pops up. I only like that there's multiple translations in one place and I don't need to buy a hundred bibles.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Seriously, the best television that I have ever watched.  I love this show so much.  the fact that we only get 10 episodes a year is torture.<br /><br />Not as much in the way of special features on this set as there was for season 1 - but still a must have for any G.O.T. fan.
B00DFFI7K2|5.0|I loved this movie, thought it was great. would have loved to see the face of snake eyes, but thats the glory of suspense I guess. some of my favorite actors in here and I thought it was a good movie
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I chose this rating because i find the game addictive!<br />My 4 year old grandson is better at the game than I am - figures!
B0000669JL|5.0|I bought this CD to replace one that was stolen.  I already know how good it is and now I have it again.  Great music.
1936594234|4.0|I just wish I there was a more obvious way of letting me know how small the words were going to be. I have reading glasses, so I'll be okay, but thank goodness I'm young lol. Thank you.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|This is very good 7 entertaining film & the 3-D version is about as good as it gets in terms of visuals (&#34;Hugo&#34; is also excellent in 3-D, & is another very good film suitable for the entire family).
B000WAEJZ0|1.0|I thought it would be different. Do yourself a favor and save your money. Not worth your time or money.
B000YAA68W|5.0|This movie portrayed the coming of age of young Iranian girl caught into between the Iranian Revolution. I thought the movie was entertaining and a hit.
B000PMFS2I|4.0|I LIKED THIS MOVIE AND I FELT THAT IT TOLD OF STORY AND THERE WERE LESSONS TAUGHT IN THIS MOVIE AS WELL.
B00E3QJ7FG|5.0|The movie is a classic, I hope they do a quality Blu-ray transfer!  I'll update my review when it's finally released...
B003DZX3SA|5.0|What can I say. It's a classic. The kids loved it and it gets lots of use as a &#34;nanny&#34;. I can put the DVD on an the kids on the block sit in a trance while I make dinner.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I loved this story. It was a little hard to follow with the dates and characters switching back and forth, but well worth the effort. A great insight into human character.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Don't let the popularity of this series fool you into thinking that it is anything  like the Twilight series. The Hunger Games is well written and does not read like young adult fiction. It's a story of bravery that you will not want to put down.
B005HEQ4XQ|5.0|We already have the DVDs, but thoroughly enjoy watching the Blu-Ray version. The audio and visual are noticeably crisper. Lovely to replay some great memories!
B00C061HZY|5.0|The songs are all well produced and a joy to listen to. It will put you in a great mood!
B009WUAK2M|4.0|If you like the actors you'll like the movie. Give it a look see and see what you think, good luck.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Good feel. I like the stats feature to track performance.  THE  ads<br />are a bit much.  This is my favorite solitaire app so far.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Beautiful and poetic at times. Hosseini knows how to weave a story and make it a page-turner. Enjoyed it very much.
B0073TZ1AA|4.0|I have not used it very much, but sure I will love it.  the reader has a very clear voice.
B007EECSFA|5.0|This book held surprise after surprise, with decent writing to enhance the plot. I would recommend hardily. Its a sleeper,folks.
B008RTE066|5.0|One of my favorite Beatle albums second only to Sgt. Pepper. Everything looks and sounds great. I love collector sets!
B00296A4F4|5.0|Love all the characters! It's a funny show full of diversity and normal high school problems. The music selection is amazing! Just a feel good show
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is the best show!!!! My husband and I enjoy watching it together! It's full of history and drama! I recommend this show.
B0000062Y2|5.0|I was so happy to hear this was just like the movie (which I loved!!!). In the movie order and clear.  The songs are like soft 70's-80's rock  reenactment of  Common Biblical narratives, focusing on Jesus as a man.  Listening to the cd will prompt you to want to READ more about Jesus the man.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Great app... can't stop playing! Love all the different scenarios... gets faster and faster the more you play. Really keeps you on your toes.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|Everything it needs to be love it....easy to fit on kindle....stands at different angles.......which makes it nice for using anywherr
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|We love the minions and are having a blast playing and reliving our favorite minion moments.  We take turns challenging our 7 year old who wins as often as we do.  Great fun for the whole family!!!
B009YP9L7U|3.0|It was interesting but somewhat confusing with starting with the marriage and then going back to the explanations as to how it happened
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|3 areas to choose! Lots of costumes to pick! Different gadgets to grab! WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?!<br />*Knock some minions off for laughter!
B000W089XS|5.0|I have loved this movie for a long time.  I had not seen it in several years until recently.  It is such a happy musical, I decided to purchase the DVD so I can watch it when ever the mood strikes.
B00013BN4S|5.0|The young Emmylou at her best. A great listen for a relaxing time during a busy day. Any true country music fan will deeply appreciate this CD.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a fun ap. It can become time consuming but my son, who is four,  and I enjoy it.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|The first two Bond films Dr. No and From Russia with Love, were relatively gimmick less, and were effective and gritty.  Goldfinger was the first film in the series to really begin to utilize tech toys, but though they did, the Bond persona as played by Sean Connery remained the no compromise enforcer of MI6. Then began the slide into ridiculous of the Roger Moore  era. While later Bonds began to bring the series back to it's roots, it was with the Daniel Craig era that we have finally got Bond all the way back. Skyfall continues this trend, de-emphasizing the importance of gadgets and letting Bond be the imperfect but dominant player that controls the film and the franchise. Now with Skyfall the old chapters are closed, and the way forward promises more Bond excellence to come, and the transition is engrossing, entertaining and ultimately fulfilling.
B003G4W49C|5.0|One heck of a ride. Card absolutely puts you in the story. This book constant accelerates from chapter to chapter. Forget the impossible. Gravity manipulation, space travel, faster than light communication, all small in comparison to what you feel as you learn and grow with Ender. From disbelief to excitement to agony and fatigue, you will feel as Ender feels. You will be happy and mad with him. You will absolutely love him. Get ready for war. You won't be able to put this one down. One of the best stories ever written by man.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Our family comes and goes on week-ends, and additional cables are always needed to meet everyone's needs as they travel, or come to visit and need to charge their devices.  We now have the needed solution to this need.
B005PK553C|4.0|Great acting and writing. Jessica Lange is amazing. I wasn't sure if I'd dig this show, but I'm really enjoying it.
B005K17RU0|4.0|This app provides good detail, with lots of information on one page. I like the maps feature and the daily forecast.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game was totally fun and easy if you like these games :) I love how it's free and u don't have to pay . You easily get attach to this game.
B005PK57IK|5.0|Been wanting to watch this for years.  Glad it is part of the Amazon Prime Network.  Just can't wait for season 4 to be released for Prime members.
B00CA4S27W|5.0|One of Blackmore's Nights' best albums.  While I truly love all of their music, this one really wrapped itself around inside of me.  I  highly recommend anyone who loves music (of any genre) to treat himself to this music...you'll become addicted!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I enjoyed it. I am a 41 year old male, but still read it with a feeling of being entertained. But this really is written more for the Justin Bieber fan than the old school rocker.
B002K0WBXW|5.0|A great feel good movie. Lots of humor. I really like it. Great for girls night out. Only has two scenes actually filmed in Sitka,AK, I know because I live in Sitka.
B00CATSONE|4.0|Well written, direct. Poses the greater question: What makes a genius, a genius? As this book States, it is both more and less than one might suspect.
B00DYEN5QU|5.0|From start to finish...  from every conceivable aspects of film making.  I've recommended it as a must see to all my family and friends.
B0085Z8F4A|4.0|I was anticipating this movie and overall I do like it. I just wish they would stop dumbing down these movies.  Opening sequence is cool, Overall look and feel of the movie is cool.  Concept is cool.  3D adds to the movie but not over the top.  My problems are basic.  A team chosen to explore a planet and possibly contact an alien ancestor would not include some guy modifying his space suit to smoke weed, just plain stupid.  A bunch of little things like that stand out to me. I could list 3 or 4 instances where the movie makers are hurting the movie with unnecessarily dumbing down the characters. Where did movie studios get this formula?  Isn't it possible to make a movie assuming that you would select a group of people that are intelligent, trained and would follow protocol in a situation like that?
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Love this app, it's reliable which makes it quick.  When things move right along .it generally means it's easy as well. In this app you get all 3 things; reliability, quick, and easy
B003UBTX6S|4.0|Get this one if you enjoyed the series before.  I am looking forward to finishing the whole series this one was one that was hard to put down.
B005LAII4E|5.0|Love this, get it all on one order, Blu-Ray and UltraViolet copy cant beat  that. So get out and buy yours now

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Now I am a little kid. So u older kids might say oh this is  a kiddish kinda game. But i think this game is awesome. I like the costumes and el machos lair, it's rlly fun
B009NG1Q96|5.0|I didn't think things could get much better after the first book but I was wrong! There has never been a moment that I wasn't emotionally involved with this book. I couldn't  put  it down. The emotional roller coaster this  book put me on was exhausting and I don't know  how America did it. I can NOT wait  for the next book!
0399162097|2.0|Well written, but not nearly as compelling as other reviewers have made it out to be. I know many have tried to keep the &#34;twist&#34; a secret, but honestly, that's not the heart of the book...the dart is about family. I found the perspective, or the narrator (same) quite unlikeable and somewhat...dare I say....boring, although the story is compelling. There are also dashes of controversial issues,  and while it fits into the story organically, woven in, the author sometimes comes off as advocating for a side, which if one is against or doesn't feel is as vital I. His or her own life, gets a bit tiresome. Sorry...I can tell the author is superbly talented, but I do wish her choices in showcasing that talent were more compelling to me.
0345803450|1.0|After searching for this book, relying on the L.A. Times book review, I finally found it on Amazon.  What a waste of time and money.  Soooooo boring.  Just could not get into it and I love English novels.  But this one was packed with uninteresting and unnecessary drivel. I NEVER leave a book unfinished . . . . .but this one was the exception.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Lots of twists and turns in this game to keep you interested, and the different challenges that make it different from other games. I love it and enjoy it very much and I can play it with my grandchildren.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I THOROUGHLY enjoyed this book, simple and delightful story and not predictable, the kind of story you stay up too late to finish reading.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|What an interesting read.  My Book Club had this book as a read of the month and when I started reading it I really loved the first chapter especially saving the hand for the finger!  However as I progressed I got totally confused as to who the characters were, I think that a family tree would have helped in the beginning of the book.  I loved Nabi who more than did his share for the family. I would recommend anyone reading this book to persevere and finish it because the ending makes everything come together.
140006922X|3.0|I give this book 3 stars for being very well crafted.  The author wears his mask well.  On the surface this books comes across as a reasonable and well thought through historical perspective on an important figure.  The trouble comes in how the author subtly sows doubt in the mind of Christians and paints Jesus as a revolutionary rather than the son of God.  This is what shape shifters do.  He doesn't deny the resurrection, he merely casts doubt on it.  He casts doubt on the words in the bible because they were written some time after the death of Jesus, yet somehow tries to paint himself as authoritative with absolutely nothing to back it up.  The author is not a religious scholar or historian as he likes to claim.  Other critics have pointed to the fact that the author is muslim.  He did in fact renounce Christianity in college and does self identify as a muslim.  That is really a sideshow here as this book is not an expression of the islamic view of Jesus.  The worldview he represents and that he is nudging Christians toward with this work is that of progressivism.  One needs to look no farther than his course on Arab revolution at Drew University to understand the point of view here.
B000001ABD|5.0|Great to hear the music again...brings me back to the 80s!<br />Would recommend this album to those looking to relive those times.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Mr. Sanderson did a nice job with this one. It has actually interested me in reading some of his books, which until now I haven't. He wraps up most of the loose ends.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Enjoyed this book almost as much as the third in the series.  Looking forward to the next.  Great continuation of the saga
B005J4ASDG|4.0|If you have the three scores, you don't need this except to complete your collecttion. However, the stuff that gets left out does irk you somewhat if you have the original three scores stuck in your head!
B001NLL93W|5.0|As this series gets more interesting with each book, so does my interest grow along with it. This book is perfect for all who love the romantic mysterious novels.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Great writing. Only criticism of this fine novel is that it is sometimes hard to follow when the time and place jump around.
B002KDUDG6|4.0|Keeping the standards alive. If you grew up with Frank and the rest of the crowd, you'll enjoy this CD.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|I like fiction with a historical background.<br />The characters are interesting and belong to the different countries involved in a war nobody seems to want.<br />Fiction and historical facts are very well connected, everything seems real.
B000NVIXDW|4.0|Always good, keeping the American standards alive for all to enjoy.  If you grew up with Frank and anyone else from that generation you'll like this CD.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I have to repeat what I said about the first book, &#34;Fall of Giants&#34;.<br />There is in it an interesting and dramatic flow of historical events which makes the book captivating.<br />I would recommend it.
B008LH4YYC|5.0|I used the ES Task Manager on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9 which is brand new. This program allows me to view my Network NAS system on the kindle, and I am able to manipulate files and pictures as well as view them at my leisure. I recommend this program app to anyone who has an issue with the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and their network NAS system.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is very addicting and super fun. If I'm not working I'm playing this. I like the new upgrade with the characters from 2 as well. for a free app u cant get ne better
B0095K9BXI|4.0|This was Cute and funny but not the best I've ever seen of this type; no objectionable content, great family film
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I really really  really like it, a lot!! its easy to use and fast. I don't like the fact that I have to use 18 words or more to say that I like it !
B005KCGIUY|4.0|big time tool fan so i had to get. as with all music it will take me time to tell if i like it or not.
B0060D11OU|5.0|So fun to show my 4 year old the movies I loved as a child! A little longer than I remembered but you can't go wrong with this classic! It's SUPERCALAFRAGALISTICEXPIALADOCIOUS!
B000KJU1MS|5.0|if ya like the band KISS and looking for something to watch on the band. its well worth it at the price i paid.
B00AZLBIAA|2.0|Cute app but we all know that hacking a WiFi system is illegal.  It's intended purpose as a prank works really well though.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I loved the detail, the character development of the story.  I was engrossed in the storyline by the second page!<br />This is a book I would enthusiastically recommend to friends and family (and have!)  It will definitely become a book to read again when I am looking for that perfect book!
B00BD62X14|4.0|If you like Bruni's past albums and want more of the same, you'll enjoy this one.  I found two songs of particular interest;  &#34;Mon Raymond&#34; about her husband, former French president Nicolas Sarkozy, and &#34;Le Pingouin&#34; which is reportedly about Sarkozy's political rival and current president, François Hollande.
B007VDN1PA|3.0|I used it mainly for slides, the results are average. The interface is poor and bothering, too many buttons to press in order to adjust the brightness, the digital pics naming can not be set and the numbering starts from 1 after any files transfer, so it makes difficulties with binding several jobs.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|Keeps you interested with colorful scenes and the story line is also compelling. In all great game if you like hidden objects.
B00D5YNQMW|3.0|This product is all well and good but as an aside, are we ever going to see some of the full pro shot concerts from the 70s that show the Boys From Boston in their prime? We all know from the video scrapbook VHS that was released in the 80s that these shows exist and in pretty decent quality too. Who wouldn't want to see a box set featuring the full show from the Detroit Silverdome from '76 of the CalJam from '78 released? I don't know, maybe this a Leber/Krebs issue and we may never get to see these gems ever, Shame.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Will Robie was a killer for the government, but when asked to kill a mother and her child he couldn't do it, however someone did it for him. The set Will Robie on an adventure to save his life and the life of a young girl.and to stop other killings. Baldacci did it again!
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|It's a great app that I love and play always. My favorite, worth much more than the 2.00 it is sold for. I would reccomend it to anyone!
0545259088|5.0|I love this series! It is totally different from any werewolf and shifter book you have ever read, very intriguing.
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|One of the best tower defense games I have played. Good design and interesting upgrades, funny characters and cute heroes.
B00012QM8G|5.0|Got this for my dad for his birthday, he loves it. He says it is a great classic movie and will watch it more than once.
B000002KXV|5.0|The Nightfly: A classic in every sense.  The reviews in this album are spot on. But I would like to take it a step further and comment on the perfection of this album from a music producer-engineers perspective.  Certain albums are used in studio's as a measuring stick for mixing and mastering perfection. This is one of those measuring sticks. Not only is the musicianship, and the lyrical composition perfection, but its mix and mix down to master are equally uniformly masterful. Gary Katz and Gary Nichols (the engineer-producers) created a recording masterpiece.  After listening to the album first for its \\"wonderfulness\\", listen again, in a quiet acoustically perfect room, or with quality headphones. The pan of each instrument in the stereo field is exact. Microphone placement and selection - again perfectly matched to the instruments and to Mr. Fagan's vocals. The equalization between instruments ensures a clean separation and none of the instruments step on one another. Close your eyes, you will feel they are playing just for you, sitting center stage in a theater with the best acoustics in the world. This was recorded back in the day before computers, its racks and racks of equipment and 2\\" 24 track analog tape recorders create a sound that is almost impossible to duplicate digitally. This album is used by the worlds best recording studios and music colleges as a standard. Its required for critical listening classes, because it is a standard to aspire to. It is truly unfortunate that the care, quality and precision of the Nightfly has mostly disappeared from the music production scene.  Listen critically  and let the Nightfly take you back.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love this game. I'm a My little pony fan.  has any one seen the my little pony equestrian girls movie???  It was awesome  on this game you can see and play with your favorite ponies such as Applejack, Rainbow  Dash, Pinkie Pie, FlutterShy, Rarity, and of course  twilight sparkle
B007J4T2G8|5.0|You have heard the hype. You suspect the content. But until you sit down and read 50 shades you will never truly understand. This book is more than a sexually explicit romance about the &#34;Darker&#34; side of sex. its a touching tale about two people who while exploring each other, begin to discover themselves. She starts out looking for nothing but her pending college graduation and the job opportunities it will bring. But a bed sick roommate with a obligation to do an interview with a young and enigmatic entrepreneur catapults her into a world she has never dreamed of. His fascination with this bright yet innocent Coed draws him from his rigidly controlled world where relationships have contracts into the light buy a girl who is constantly breaking the rules. Complete with an ending that will have you scrambling to buy the next book. Don't get sidetracked by what you think this book is about.
B009M2T7K6|5.0|My granddaughter LOVES it!!!  She takes it in the bath with her every night-holding up well so far. Good buy.
0345529057|5.0|This four volume set of books even came with a CASE which isn't in the picture, KOOL! (Seller: blueridgebook. Used--Like New, but was Brand New! Yeah, yeah, I know, but it added to MY pleasure.)
B00E194KGQ|4.0|This new album is pure 5FDP... it's like a tribute to the first 3 albums with all the goodies from the first albums! I strongly suggest the album!<br /><br />METAL!!!!!!
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|It was more curiosity than anything, but I fell in love with it & the characters! Its almost like hunger games in a different light! Def recommend! =D
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Just downloaded it for my son to play on his birthday kindle fire and it won't start just says loading.  Hopefully an update soon will fix it.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I'm really disappointed. This game was GREAT...so much fun and I was so excited it was free. Then today I got the update and now it won't even open. It gets stuck on the quick tips screen and switches between loading and 0% downloading! I had to uninstall and reinstall...still won't work! Really disappointed that I lost my progress and I can't play any more. :( Please fix it!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|the most realistic horse game I have ever used before. a def try for all age groups. give it a tryyyyy
B00BPLDCVM|5.0|I love this show. Every part of it is so well done. The soundtrack included. It get's me pumped up and I suddenly find it easier to clean the house or go on that dreaded jog! haha The only down side to the CD is that it is not long enough!! ;)
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|fun app.  and as you know every one loves the<br />minions :D I realy lie this game. lots of fun, I recomend (slept that wrong but cant figure it out ohh well I'm tired :p )
