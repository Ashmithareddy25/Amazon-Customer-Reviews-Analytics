B005IQZB14|5.0|Frightening and thought-provoking. My book club reviewed it. Much discussion of her personal safety,mlavknof preparation, but happy she survived. Many of us cherish our times and nerd to be alone from time to time and how our society's glut of outside stimulation often makes that difficult. We loved the book and her writing.
B00CX7OW1G|5.0|Permeated by a sense of the sacred, Terrence Malick's latest film points us to the transience of all things. Appropriately titled To the Wonder, the film has Malick's stamp written all over it: philosophical voice-overs uttered in hushed tones to a haunting orchestral soundtrack, panoramic displays of the physical beauty of nature, a story that features little dialogue, and an untranslatable feeling for the spiritual. Released just two years after his critically acclaimed The Tree of Life, Malick introduces us to the main characters immediately but they feel more like symbols than real people and we never really get to know and understand the \\"why\\" of their actions.<br /><br />Neil (Ben Affleck) is an environmental inspector traveling in Europe when he meets Marina (Olga Kurylenko), a divorcee who is living in Paris with her ten-year-old daughter Tatiana (Tatiana Chiline). As the film opens, we hear Olga's voice-overs turn the world into inner space: \\"Newborn, I open my eyes. I melt into the eternal night. A spark. You brought me out of the shadows. You lifted me off the ground. You brought me back to life.\\" \\"What is this love that loves us? It comes from nowhere. From all around. The sky. You, cloud. You love me too.\\" One is unclear if she is talking to Neil or to God.<br /><br />Visiting Mount St. Michel, Neil and Marina climb to the top of the abbey \\"to the Wonder\\" where she sees a world \\"forever at peace.\\" The camera then caresses them in the mud of the beach as they express their love playfully - glancing, laughing, gesturing, and kissing with freedom and sensuality, \\"two wings of the same spirit.\\" They go to Paris and walk among its fountains, rivers, and monuments. Olga twirls like a ballet dancer with uncommon grace but Neil is expressionless, stolid, and impenetrable. When they go back to Neil's home in Bartlesville, Oklahoma, however, their relationship takes a different shape, existing in a stultifying environment of polluted water, cookie-cutter houses furnished sparingly, and the feeling, expressed cogently by Tatiana, that \\"there's something missing,\\" perhaps mirroring Malick's childhood in the Southwest.<br /><br />Sadly, the \\"something missing\\" begins to be filled in by quarreling, lack of communication, and frustration. Like the local Spanish-speaking priest, Father Quintana, played by a soulful Javier Bardem, they are searching for something that seems just beyond their grasp. Marina seeks solace with the priest but, like the Curé d'Ambricourt in The Diary of a Country Priest, he is filled with self-doubt and a sense of failure. He tells God \\"Everywhere you're present and I can't even see you.\\" He asks \\"Show me how to love you\\" and, as he tends to the poor, the addicts, the prisoners, and the sick, recites the moving words from St. Patrick's Breastplate:<br /><br />\\"Christ with me, Christ before me, Christ behind me, Christ in me, Christ beneath me, Christ above me, Christ on my right, Christ on my left, Christ when I lie down, Christ when I sit down, Christ when I arise...\\"<br /><br />He gives sermons to a half-empty church, hears confessions, gives communion, but the look on his face prompts an elderly woman to pray for him so he can \\"achieve the gift of joy.\\" Father Quintana's alienation reflects the crisis of Neil and Marina whose conflicts result in the desire for freedom. Marina goes back to France when her visa expires, but experiences a new loneliness in Europe and returns to Oklahoma where Neil has reunited with an old friend, Jane, (Rachel McAdams), now a rancher raising buffaloes.<br /><br />Enigmatic, distancing, and often infuriating, To the Wonder does not have the immediate impact of The Tree of Life, yet in its own way is a meditation on love just as mysterious and profound. A film that takes place \\"in a realm which no word has ever entered,\\" it is a work that suggests, implies, and evokes rather than commands, forcing us to confront how we connect to ourselves and the world around us, to bewith the images without trying to figure them out, to weave our way in and out of the silences, to let go into the acceptance of not knowing, and to be aware of the wonder around us and bathe in its light.

B0036TGSIK|5.0|Hey, I don't have much to add to all the other reviews, but just wanted to say that this is a good family (for OLDER kids, like mid-late teens) movie.  It is funny and intelligent.  We all enjoyed it very much!

B004742Y68|5.0|This movies was one of the all time greats, as far as an &#34;oldie.&#34;  It is scary, yet not gory, and intriguing.  I loved this movie!!
B006M4F67A|4.0|I really enjoy playing this game. It's addictive with many levels. I enjoy trying to beat my own time. I highly recommend this game.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Great book!  A little slow in the beginning but the ending blew my mind!  What a shocker!  It left me wondering...what would I have done?
B0067QPVJ6|4.0|It's difficult to follow in the footsteps of John Carpenter.  That is why this only gets 4 stars.  I don't think it will ever be a classic like JCTT, but it's a good watch on it's own.
1451695195|4.0|Having a man of science describe that which cannot be explained, makes a powerful statement to believers and non-believers alike.<br />What a testimony he gives!  I have recommended this read to everyone showing interest in the 'what's next' question we all ponder.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Tom Clancy has an uncanny ability to write a fiction novel BEFORE it becomes non-fiction in the NEWS!<br />The cyber war between China and the US is currently all over the NEWS...this book is like reading the<br />off-the-record background!
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|This show is compelling, interesting and thoughtfully filmed and designed.  It was nothing like what I expected, and I really enjoy it.
B009NY43NY|1.0|After reading these books for years, I expected the series to go out with a bang! I felt like the final book was written by someone who didn't care about the series. I can not believe Charlaine Harris considered this worthy of publishing. A long time fan of her other series, I am done reading anything by her. The plot was a mess, involved characters I wasn't too fond of to begin with, and displayed inaccuracies. For instance, Sookie was always able to read Sam's thoughts and the last book didn't address that. Instead, it allowed for Sam to be an option for Sookie since she couldn't read his thoughts anymore. There was no final, heart breaking good-bye between Sookie and Eric, and the sex between Sam and Sookie left me feeling gross. The true fans were owed so much more. Don't waste your time or money. You will be disappointed.
1439153663|5.0|the description wasn't compelling, but the story and the writing were! this was a great choice for our neighborhood book club.
B00005QW5X|4.0|This is a good, unusual, human interest movie, entertaining and interesting.  My only real gripes:<br /><br />The character development of the other band members was extremely limited.  All focus was on Hedwig.<br /><br />Hedwig was basically just a big, pouty, spoiled brat.  Seriously, get over it, move on, take some responsibility, and quit being such a victim.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|In typical Hosseini style the story comes full circle after generations of time. He has a lovely knack for confusing the reader with beautiful life stories that are loosely related. In the end you realize that a tragic life can still be a gripping beautiful story. You feel like you really know the characters lives by the end and that all the angst was worth it in the end. Beautiful ending.
B00C7DGRL4|4.0|This is not an Oscar winning movie, but I did not care.  Sci-fi mixed with a little action and maybe some eye candy thrown in for good measure.  Memorable no, but sometimes you need a little fluff in you life!!<br /><br />Good:  Cool story, good special effects and who doesn't like Jeremy Remmer<br /><br />Bad:  Plot a little weak but who cares.<br /><br />Overall:  With my popcorn and soda I had a good time watching this movie!!
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|superb. I never get tired of it. I find myself playing it time after time. this is the best ninjas kiwi game ever.

0345803485|1.0|I can sum up Fifty Shades of Grey in one sentence:  \\"A naive virgin (who turns out to be a nymphomaniac) falls in love with a perverted billionaire.\\"<br /><br />I am a guy and I did actually read this book.  At first the sex scenes were interesting and exciting because I'd never read anything so graphic before.  But pretty soon you realize that they are just a gimmick and/or filler to make the book longer.  Honestly, if you take all of the sex scenes out you would literally have a book that is only 50 pages long.  The book is also completely devoid of reality.  NOBODY has that much sex!  They do it at least 2-3 times per day.  And the girl who was a virgin with no sexual experience suddenly turns into a sex-crazed maniac.  Everything Christian does turns her on.  He could fart and belch at the same time and I'm sure she would be like \\"Oh my!\\"<br /><br />But I can see why this book is popular with women.  The whole book is every girl's fantasy.  A average nobody girl catches a handsome, philanthropic billionaire and he buys her all kinds of gifts and cars and flowers and vacations.  She keeps swooning about how \\"romantic\\" he is.  Umm, yeah I could be romantic too if I had unlimited money!  The perfect book for middle-aged women who don't have billionaire husbands.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Tons of sound options to block out the world, including brown and Pink noise. Well worth it if you need that extra nudge to relax or get some sleep.
B00CL50LEC|4.0|Bored at home and based on the preview I thought I would give this movie a shot.  I am glad I did!  It was quirky and maybe a little predictable but overall enjoyable.<br /><br />Good:  Different kind of zombie flick.  Sort of Zombie meets girl etc..<br /><br />Bad:  You can see where the plot is going about 10 minutes in..<br /><br />Overall:  I enjoyed it!!  It was different...
B001UGB1X8|4.0|Good action movie.  Well acted by Tommy Lee Jones, as would be expected.  good plot with good production values.  I didnt give it  five stars because I would have liked a little more action and less talking.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It turned my Kindle into  giant big-button calculator with all the features and processes I could want.  Being free sure helped as well.
B00CWVFPGO|2.0|A true disappointment. I went into it not expecting much, hoping for an average movie at best. I didn't even get that had to fast forward it twice and I still never watched the ending.
B0023SDPS6|4.0|If you come to this series of novels from having watched the A&E TV series you will definitely see the Characters in light of the television roles.The Australian Actor Robert Taylor inhabits the Character of Walt Longmire and Katee Sackhoff is \\"Vic\\". The other Characters come out very well. The novel is part Modern Western, American Mystery and a study of quirky characters. There is depth with a laconic tone. I admit it is not a John Steinbeck character study or dialogue reminiscent of Hemingway. What it is is a good solid read one can enjoy on a long flight or hot afternoon with a glass of Jack Daniels \\"Black label and a good cigar. The details are authentic in regards to nerdy stuff like ballistics. Much of the story can be seen in the episode \\"Unfinished Business\\", don't expect word for word interpretation in video so there is freshness in the read. P.S. you gotta like \\"The Ferg\\".
B00969PR18|5.0|Finally I found this app and read its help and it turned out to be my most important app for offline location function. Recommended for those who travel and don't want to rely on WiFi.

Before that and in between, I watched for myself.  I love the Disney Pixar, they just keep getting better and better.  This is my kind of princess.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|Very well done documentary that progresses quickly on a forward pace.  Lets the public become aware of some of the truly horrendous conditions born by animals as well as  the abusive practices of large factory farms toward smaller independent farmers.  Every congressman should be forced to view this video..
1582701707|5.0|Great book in great shape for a great price.  i like the hardback copy and will likely keep it for my collection.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Compelling novel. I could not put it down once I started. The beautiful story is truly inspiring. Definitely worth purchasing.
B00CWVFZ8W|3.0|Honestly I read the book because I couldn't afford to go to the movies.  I absolutely loved the book..the movie not so much. Way to much information and to many characters were left out. Maybe the movie would have been better if I was unaware of what's missing.  Suggestion see the movie then read the book! Another pet peeve of mine is bad southern accents...so for anyone that disagrees sorry!  Being a southern girl I can tell when one is faked and really bad :( and the only character that pulled off a passable accent was Uncle Macon.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This game is phenomenal it makes you wanna play more and more it reels you into the story but....only if the full version was free that would even more and more great I hope. they make it free so everyone will get a chance in this awesome action/thriller of a game
B0060D15AK|4.0|I was looking for a movie to watch on a train ride.  The plot is a given, but just the same I enjoyed it.  I'm not a big movie watcher, so I may not be the best person to do a movie review, just the same a great cast, a few laughs, entertaining and the train ride is half way over.
B0000C23DO|5.0|very good compilation of hits. The Dead were a super group who will be listened to for years. Very good cd.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I liked the book I seem to like all diary of a wimpy kid books and if you've never tried one of those books I'm sure you'll love it
B004MYFUC8|3.0|the style and vocabulary of the writing is more interesting than the story.  I enjoyed it but you may very well not.
B006M4F67A|4.0|Just a great game!  Only weakness is in the directions for the game which are very basic and don't really tell you much,  but after playing a few games you pretty much get the idea.
B0027MJU00|2.0|I am not sure what I was expecting, but somehow this author could not keep my interest. Maybe others will find it to their liking, but I just couldn't get hooked.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|Nicely written, Kept me engaged. Read it straight through late one night/early one morning. In some ways, it was like reading a narrative or phenomenology qualitative research paper, learning about the lived experience of foster children and how it carried over into adult life. I don't mean it was dry or boring, it was very real and helped me learn. Plus the flowers meanings and they provided a backbone to the story was lovely. The scenes of her as a pregnant woman and then mother were especially evocative of the challenges a young woman experiences.
B003G4W49C|5.0|It's both a page turner and a thought provoker.<br /><br />The insight into the thinking processes and frustrations of both normal and &#34;gifted&#34; children was spot on and draws one further and further into the story until you actually become one with Ender himself.... I hope that the movie can some how pull this off as it will be very VERY hard to do.<br /><br />This is a MUST READ for anyone who wants to see the movie - read the book first!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Anybody who is debating starting this series of books should start and stay committed to get to A Storm of Swords. It is an amazing piece of fiction that always keeps you guessing and contains hardly ever a dull moment. Hard to pull off, considering its size. I'm oh-so-very glad that I decided to read this series and can't wait to see what happens next!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|way cool<br />great fun but alittle to short. please. the graphics were excellence. and the voices were good.  please keep your great games comlng!

B008AK8FHM|5.0|I have always believed that some are to travel to the other side, to let us all know that there is hope for us. There will always be the doubters, and that is ok, but I know what I believe.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|This is a must-see movie for everyone! In fact, I find it so important that I show it to my students in biology class every year. Most people don't know where their food comes from and how much influence big corporations have on how we eat, work, live and treat animals as well as workers. This movie has inspired me to play closer attention to what all is involved in food production to the point where I will no longer eat food from factory farms. Which choices you make after you've watched this movie, is up to you, but I do believe the consumer needs to be educated in order to make a choice!
B0035JGYZS|5.0|Loved it! Watching these in order with my boys was great! Now the boys know more about the characters in the newer movies..
1451695195|5.0|Excellent and revealing.  It answers a lot of my questions about the after life.  I can recommend it to any one who lost a loved one.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|The movie was really pretty good over all. They did seen to go out of their way to make it gorry to the point way over exaggerating the effects of the weapons. Sharing the movie out continued to stop and restart throughout the showing. While this was very anoyingi did not file a complaint, and I was notified by Amazon that the cost of the rental was refunded because they became aware ofthe problem. That said impress me.
B000E33VWW|5.0|Phillip Seymour Hoffman is a true star. Capote is great. If you like an artsy to whimsical film, this is for you, and have an open mind. I can watch this movie over and over and be amused every time. Maybe not a perfect production, but I wouldn't even know because PSH is so mesmerizing.
B000ID37RM|5.0|Harper Lee wrote her Pulitzer award wining novel, To Kill a Mockingbird, over 50 years ago. It is a book worth reading and re-reading to &#34;see&#34;,  understand, and remember both the noble and the evil forces in the small southern &#34;tired old town&#34; of Maycomb during the  early years of the 20th century.
B0027MJU00|5.0|So good. Suspenseful .great characters. The best of her books so far.<br />Great mystery with twists and turns. Enjoyed it
B002UWH8P6|5.0|This two year long series is serial in nature rather than episodic.  Each episode satnds on its own but builds the characters, events and timelines from earlier episodes.  It may not be everyones's cup of tea but I was very sorry to see it only last two seasons.  The concept of the storyline left endless opportunities for new discoveries.

B00C061I3K|4.0|The current #1 album by the revered French ensemble, Daft Punk, &#34;Random Access&#34; is the most refreshing album in awhile.....totally paying homage to Chic (with production by Nile Rodgers) and the era of dance music that was about extended mixes, how grooves and solid licks. In those age of one generic, un identifiable group after another, Daft Punk triumphantly, no apologies needed show that all that is old is new.

B00AKKTDJY|5.0|This game is quite fun in that you have customers in different color cloths coming into the diner. You try to place them at the color seating chart for multiple point bonuses(this can be tough sometimes due to all the customers coming in). Different customers have different attitudes and time constraints and you have to try to serve them with this in mind. As you score levels and points, you can buy upgrades with those points. All in all, this game is quite fun and sometimes stressful to take care of your customers in the diner. Give it a try and see if you can run a diner. Awh come on, give it a try...

B000001F9N|5.0|A Love Trilogy is an out and out disco album.  All the tricks of the trade are present.  Most of the wizardry shines as they work in balance with each other.  Thankfully, Pete, Giorgio and Donna nix or downplay what could be cheesier elements that, in more inept hands, would later lead to disco's demise.<br /><br />Lead-off track is an epic opus.  \\"Try Me, I Know We Can Make It\\" is a fun and fierce mating call that is lead by a strong bassline, self assured kick drums, slinky and playful strings coy guitar chords and Donna's breathy and sultry come ons.<br /><br />The team set out to prove that even the most bombastic, over-the-top power ballad can find new breaths of life in their glittered soaked hands and voices.  Barry Manilow's \\"Could It Be Magic\\" was stripped of its morose and sentimental tear-jerker status and transformed into a racy, Adults-only, foot stomper that raises the roof higher and higher with each passing measure.<br /><br />\\"Wasted\\" and \\"Come With Me\\" finish out just over 30 minute length album.  Neither are throw-away selections designed simply for fleshing out an album.  \\"Wasted\\" is hard and white-knuckled grip that never forgets it's on a true blue disco album.<br /><br />\\"Come With Me\\" continues walking the line of appealing to the masses and injecting the risque all disguised by Summer's innocent, almost prepubescent vocal stylings.  Another daringly naughty gesture the creators used to max effect.<br /><br />There's little downtime on this album.  It's disco and it knows it.  But, it's disco at the topmost level.  Moroder and Summer made legendary collaborations together.  They dominated the mid to late 1970s.  For all lovers of dance and disco music, this album is one of the founding blocks of everything from House music, eurobeat, eurodance, freestyle, hi-nrg, electronica and all the various sub genres developed from those.

B0050DIWFC|5.0|This suspenseful , unique novel is fantastically written . It is a fresh approach and angle to the murder mystery genre. Written in the perspective of an accused's father, the story forces you to confront your own biases and trust of those you love. You ask yourself how far would you go to protect and defend your own children, and whether you can ever view your own kin unbiasedly.

B000FCKGPC|5.0|This series is exceptional.  I usually avoid Sci-Fi but this is an excepttion.  Love to read the books then watch the movies.  I prefer the  books.  It takes a while to keep the characters straight and it is frustrating jumping from character to character.  Game of Thrones really has really lived up to the reputation it is gaining by the month.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was full of action, heartache and love that i fell instantly in love with it! You'll love it!!
B00BIPORC8|5.0|I love this show. The dialogue & acting are both great, and the stories are compelling. I especially like the mix of politics & law.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Flynn is a master story teller. She alternates between different narrators and perspectives on the violent disappearance of the narrators wife. The story unravels in layer upon layer, adding to the complexity. She forces you to question who you believe and how you would behave under the circumstances. The characters are fascinating, relevant , and completely unique. A must read all around.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|This game is like galaxa. You have ships, rocks, worms, you name it coming from outer space trying to destroy your ship. What I like about it is the firing is automatic and all you have to do it move your ship. This game is fast action and a beast to play. I like it.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|This movie was great.  Perfect for kids (totally appropriate, no suggestive anything) but memorable for adults who remember old school video games!  It was really the perfect kid-adult movie!  Highly recommended!!!
B0054SMIH6|5.0|Loved this movie!! Definitely a must see!! The quality of the video is superb! If you want to relax at home and watch a movie, look no further!
B005LAIHE0|2.0|I am an expert in picking good romantic comedies. It's practically the only genre of movies I like, because it makes you feel good.Bu this one was slow, bizarre, and a little boring. Great cast, a few funny jokes, but I wouldn't watch this again or recommend to others.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Loved this app.  A lot of interesting twists and surprises, not extremely difficult and a nice challenge.  I am looking forward to the next one!
B00A81NFAS|5.0|I saw a trailer on IMDB for Silver Linings Playbook, hunted down a theater (it was initially limited release) and dragged my cousin to this movie in December. I won bc she thanked me for dragging her along. This is such a fantastic movie with an exceptionally talented class. It was sad that Bradley Cooper did not win an Oscar for his role, but it was good to see Jennifer Lawrence win for her performance. After seeing this movie, I told anyone and everyone to get out and see this movie and how it would be worth the $11 ticket. My frustration was that it was released on DVD so late! Love this movie!!!!
B004TI1WME|3.0|I downloaded this app not expecting to much. But, was pleasantly surprised in how easy to use this one is. I like the large visual display on this calculator. Otherwise, it's just a calculator. This one I will keep.
B00A7W29BE|5.0|Follow the other reviewers' advice and grab this now while it's free, no matter what your device. I downloaded and installed it this morning on my Kindle Fire HD 7&quot; and scanned the 5 pages I wanted to keep from a catalog, then imported them all into one single document ... all using this app and my front-facing camera. Took me 5 minutes total. See, I'm already used to trying to take pics with the KFHD camera, so I knew I could figure out a way to make this work. I don't have a smartphone (yet) so right now I use the KFHD for just about everything.<br /><br />Here's how: Lay the paper object you want to scan on the kitchen counter. Behind it (between the object and the wall) place something like a box of crackers on its side so that the front or back of the box is facing you, but sideways. With the Genius Scan app ready in camera mode, prop the Kindle on the box so that the camera lens is pointing down at your object. It will be almost in a parallel plane to the counter. Squat down so you can see what's showing on the screen, and when it looks right, press the button to take a picture. Voila! (Ok, it's a workaround for now, but hey, I love a technical challenge.)<br /><br />One caveat: The button to shoot the pic in this app just happens to be in the same position as the Kindle's menu button, and unlike other camera apps, it doesn't change location when you rotate the device. So just be careful and make sure you can clearly see the button from your bent-over position so you know you're pushing the right one.<br /><br />I love that you can adjust/crop the scans after shooting them. And they came out fairly high-res, too, as long as I had a steady hand. My only complaint is that the default &quot;enhancement&quot; when saving the file is for black and white, but that's no biggie, as it's just two more screen taps to change it to color. In 5 minutes, I collected the 5 objects I wanted to save for future reference out of the catalog, put them all together in one docand pitched the catalog in the recycle bin. Five less pieces of paper clutter on my desk waiting to be filed in my &quot;remodeling ideas&quot; folder. Cool.
0670026638|5.0|Captivating and unpredictable storyline keeps the reader engaged.  I hardly recommend this book. Our book club selected it and deemed the choice successful.
B00BGIC2J2|4.0|This movie was absolutely hilarious in my opinion. However, just like Get Him to the Greek/Forgetting Sarah Marshall, you wouldn't know that this movie is a sequel to Knocked Up. However, it really doesn't matter because it holds its own.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|The group of 10 year old boys amused themselves for hours playing this game. They played on two KH HD devices side by side for a long time.  It would be a hit if If this game could become multi player
B0094M2SCI|5.0|This is the best of the set! They should have jumped on the series thing before the Vampire Diaries! Great fight scenes. I hope they make a couple more.
B008RXYOKY|5.0|I own several Firewire 800 drives and am happy I can still use them, thanks to this adapter. Expensive, yes, but at this point, Apple's product is the only game in town and a must-have if you want to extend the usability of your FW drives.
B0014E9188|5.0|... this concert is from their Deadwing tour featuring most of the songs from that album... I guess if I had any gripe about it that would be how it was shot/edited... they shifted a lot to black & white and sometimes sepia tones which I imagine was the look and mood they were going for given the cover and artwork involved with the Deadwing album... but at times it was annoying... but the sound quality and performances were outstanding - most notably &#34;Arriving Somewhere But Not Here&#34;, &#34;Open Car&#34; and a beautiful yet amusing version of &#34;Trains&#34; to close the set... it is well worth owning.
B009GX6SSK|5.0|I was so glad to see that Amazon Video had NCIS LA on its list. Since living in Japan, I wanted to watch it and now I'm all caught up!!!
B005BGBPBG|5.0|This movie was absolutely hilarious in my opinon.<br /><br />Great for a date movie with your hubby ;] make him watch it ladies!
B003V6L94Q|5.0|Great album.  All the songs are wonderful. Makes me feel good to listen to this CD.  I would recommend it.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Luv this app it's great but once u've gotten really far u have 2 buy really expensive things but overall it's great
B00AS1Q93S|5.0|fast moving and action packed and good mental tickle.  Robert Duval and Cruise good combo. The lawyer gal was good too.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Absolutely great story line and exceptional acting performances. The setting and the architecture is evocative of the period and captures the essence of the society. The use of language is thoroughly delightful.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book surprised  Me as well as the 1st two books! Suzanne Collins is an amazing writer as well. I love all of her books they are wonderful!
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book is an intense, emotional and psychological drama. The science fiction story line is a mere prop for the more elaborate mind game. I don't see how this will translate we'll onto the big screen but it will be an interesting comparison.
B009JZPH32|1.0|The drug dealers problems between Mexico and USA is a subject that should be respected, a lot of innocent people is dying because of that and this film shows an irrelevant and pointless aspect of the conflict.  Moreover, apart of John Travolta and Benicio del Toro the actors' performance was terrible.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|I LOVED, LOVED, LOVED THIS!!! I have watched it several times and I have told everyone I know how good it is.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like how it can be switched from left to right handed playing. Fun,  not too hard or too easy.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Absolutely great story line and exceptional acting performances. The setting and the architecture is evocative of the period and captures the essence of the society. The use of language is thoroughly delightful.
B0027MJU00|5.0|This is a tragically-sad family saga involving murder told primarily from the viewpoint of the youngest survivor who, now grown, is damaged and haunted, yet decides (forced by circumstances) to fight back and discover the truth of what actually happened that nightmarish night - despite the consequences.<br /><br />Gillian Flynn is a great storyteller. So far, Gone Girl is the best of the bunch (in my opinion) but I love the psychological aspect she brings to all her novels, each one pulling you into the narrative and dialog because her writing is so damned good about people doing bad things. And why not? After all, the genre of her books are about crime and mystery and mayhem. So of course the subject matter is going to be grim and foreboding as the title, Dark Places, forecasts. And even when her characters veer toward being unsympathetic or just people you love to hate, they are so fascinating and believable they draw you in closer like a seductive flame.<br /><br />If this novel has flaws - well, so too does life. I find her writing to be descriptively raw, visceral and fluid, punctuated by sharp insights into human behavior, even darkly humorous at times, and almost seemingly effortless which, again, illustrates her talent.<br /><br />Also worth reading: [[ASIN:0615311792 Exploits of the Satyr]]
B00CE379IM|3.0|It did not follow the book, it was off from the book in a lot of areas.  They need to learn from Harry Potter and the hunger games how to stay close not perfect to how the book plays out.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Tarantino's style with excellent performance. Great movie, I really love it. The sequence and the music, everything great, totally recommended.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Enjoyable read and a great insight into Sanderson's creativity. Would definitely recommend to anyone who enjoys Brandon's writings. Won't disappoint.
B0014D6PCO|5.0|I have seen this movie 7 times and thought it was time to own it on Blu-ray. A great start to a wonderful trilogy.
B00821OX98|3.0|Very little character development during the first season and what little there is reveals the characters to be bland and cliche.  The story is cool and leaves this sci-fi fan wanting to know more.  Hoping that season 2 makes the characters more interesting and picks up some steam.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|For anyone who is curious about what happens to us when we die (and that would include most of us), this is a fascinating and provocative read. Granted, it is nonfiction, and I will take the author at his word on this but, to his credit, the story unfolds like literary fiction. Meaning, it's riveting.<br /><br />What came to mind was a movie-length adaptation of an episode from the television series House: A healthy neurosurgeon is suddenly stuck down by a severe and puzzling form of meningitis and slips into a coma, resulting in a near-death experience (NDE), a preview of heaven, then a miraculous recovery with no brain damage, and the doctor returns to life to tell the tale.<br /><br />I appreciated the medical details the author brings to this memoir - which is not surprising since Alexander is a neurosurgeon who knows the ins-and-outs of this life-and-death business. So the fact that he is the one who becomes trapped on the other side of the glass, or mirror, metaphorically speaking - the doctor now the patient facing death - is a key factor in making this story resonate. If told by a car salesman or motivational speaker (no disrespect to these professions) - it just would not have the same impact.<br /><br />Proof of Heaven? I can practically hear the atheists screaming no! The believers shouting yes! And the agnostics shaking their heads every which way. Why? Because no one truly knows. That is the human condition: to wonder. As for me, the book helps confirm what I have felt most of my life. We have a soul. And death is not the final chapter.<br /><br />Also worth reading: [[ASIN:0615586155 heretofore]].
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I have been waiting for this app to come out ever since I got it on my ipod. now I can finally play it once my battery on my ipod has completely run out. Awesome!!!!
B000W44IZW|4.0|Fascinating!  You can always expect an outstanding film that is directed by Luc Besson.  The Big Blue is one of the best films I have seen and it took a long time before I was able to finally see this.  Highly recommended!
0765325950|5.0|I started the series ten years ago and fell in love with the series. A series of this length and depth is a true representation of Jordan's creativity. The ending was bittersweet but felt so right. Jordan has set the bar high for those attempting to write a massive world.
B007RTAR64|5.0|Okay.. So I have 456 Barbies and she is in my top 10. The outfit and extras are done so well. Even if you are not crazy about the movie you will like the doll.
B002NVTSGQ|5.0|I'd put this up with Arrested Development and The Office as one of the greatest modern comedies.  Somehow it manages to combine outrageous guffaws with a nice message without being preachy.  My favorite character?  Right now it's Phil the dad who is  a completely well-meaning goober with a total lack of self-awareness.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game look so not like something I would like but it is VERY FUN I enjoy playing it a lot it is a great stress reliever.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. I can play till it just dies. This game needs a better update but that's the only thing I can say ducks.
B005EGXTL2|5.0|This whole series was like a drug. The more I read the more I wanted.  Looking forward to reading more from Suzanne Collins
B0064MGU98|4.0|I have not been interested in watching this show primarily due to the title &#34;the Good Wife&#34; , sounds too much like a soap. I finally decided to give it a try on my IPad with Amazon prime, figuring I had nothing to lose. I was was surprised to discover that this show was actually well written and very entertaining!  Just goes to show that you can't judge a show by a stupid title.
B00BESCJII|3.0|I've spent an evening watching less fulfilling things.  It was interesting in the aspect of it being a trip back to the 90's (it felt that way for me anyway).  I would have loved this movie in my early 20's.
B007CI81IQ|3.0|The topic is extremely fascinating, the conclusions they draw are surprising, but the presentation is dull. They write like academics, which they are. A good writer could have made this book so much better.
B000NY12LO|5.0|Surprise ending! Always love her books. I can't wait to pick another one to read. With this being about a school shooting, many parts were hard to read but we'll written.
B007AMMZA4|5.0|One of the best, screwed up stories to come out of Spain. The story line is well told through a series of flashbacks and I'm just crazy about this movie. Like really. Screwed up things like this entertain me c:
B008PUF3VS|5.0|A special friendship in a difficult time. Two innocent boys developing a frienship looking at the world from different sides of the fence. Heary warming but very sad
B0087GJ8KM|1.0|The book is a sad commentary on a brilliant man.<br /><br />It seems Dan the lawyer is working on building some type of case - and it won't win in court.<br /><br />Boring, boring, boring; trite, disconnected, overbearing; an excessive compilation of \\"studies\\", and a book filled with essentially nothing new under the sun.  There are innumerable high quality resources available, and tons of organizations, that are much more informative, focus on the human touch aspects of marketing and sales, networking, and referrals, et al.<br /><br />What happened to the \\"whole new mind\\" concept, his capacity for creative thinking?<br /><br />On the upside, I did learn my personality type is: \\"ambivert\\".  Yea!<br />Now, I no longer feel insecure and am happy knowing I am \\"normal\\".<br /><br />Will the real Dan please return!  Or, if this is the real Dan, please go back to being incognito.
B00BGIBVRG|4.0|The previews really don't do this one justice.  If you're curious, check it out, it will likely be rewarding.<br /><br />Another one that I kinda consciously avoided.  But then I was on a really long flight, it was in the movies, and I watched most of it.  Then we landed...with 20 minutes left in the movie.  So had to redo it here<br /><br />There were lots of laff out loud moments for me (37, gf is 42).  It's so painfully and hilariously truthful at every turn....I feel kinda bad, yet I'm going &#34;this happened/happens,&#34; and I'm still laughing at it.  I guess that's multifaceted.
1451627297|3.0|Like most Stephen King books, I enjoyed the plot here and most of the characters but didn't care for the writing style. It was a really imaginative story and I was kept interested throughout the whole long ride. However, I did not care for Sadie's character or the whole love-story aspect at all. I wish he had kept it more focused on JFK instead.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|The best book of the series!  It starts out fast in Andor and never stops.  Sanderson was able to wrap up the plot points that seemed to be going nowhere and kept the story focused.
B00BC24NT4|1.0|It is hard to give a negative opinion for the book of a distinguished writer. He certainly has a great recitative style for its own sake, even if the style encompasses boring passages. After the first 100 pages I wanted to give up reading it, but forced myself to read another 50 pages. Each new chapter seems like a new story begins unrelated to anything previously written. This drags on until the last page of the chapter where the story awkwardly connects.<br /><br />One also gets the impression the author is trying to be modern through the use of street language, which can be distracting those who would like to be elevated by a well-written book.  The “spy master” found a way to present dry vaguely related spy stories which make a reader wanting to give up this book and return to books by Grisham, Silva, Dan Brown, and other current best sellers.
B0050OMJIW|2.0|I'd heard so much about 'Catch 22'. Honestly, the characters were irritating and the text was hard work! Not my kind of book,
B001O12PCU|5.0|I love the opening music soundrack as Vin Diesel walks through the &#34;city&#34;.  Action, a bit of comedy, some sci-fi, great guy flick.
B000FBJFSC|4.0|I thought it was a good story about how Frank endured and then overcame poverty.  It gives one a knowledge that we can rise and overcome problems of our youth.
B00130EVSS|2.0|Promises more than it delivers... If you are looking for another History of Violence ..look again.  If you are looking for a good thriller ...look again. If I had to sum it up in one word ... \\"BORING\\" with periods of graphic violence that did nothing to enhance the movie... save your money and rent History of Violence.
B001UEBHYS|5.0|Loved the setting(India) that made the movie that much more interesting.  Enjoyed the actors and the story line.  I would recommend watching this movie.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This is the scariest SLENDER game on the kindle fire, I can't even play at night. It is so scary totally worth the money. Buy it now.
B004ZY0VHY|4.0|I found this a different perspective on killers, from the point of view of the mother.  A very tragic story.
B00499NHLC|5.0|The modern revision of Sherlock Holmes is possibly the best ever. Great cast. Terrific acting.  I can't wait to see what happens next!
B009HUB40Y|5.0|The name is very misleading.  But the game is solid.  To many ads, bit for free what so you expect.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great way to pass time! the games are really cool and lots of fun!! I'm sure glad I got it!
B00CW665VI|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed &#34;Tangled&#34;  from beginning to end with many laugh out loud moments throughout the book. It was a light and refreshing read about a player who thinks he has the flu when he's actually been bitten by the love bug.  Lol.
6305428042|5.0|Love this movie! Looked everywhere for it...found it here. The movie is very entertaining and family friendly. Best Halloween movie ever!
B0063M22QO|4.0|I play mahjong on the computer daily.  I think I am going to use this game a lot.  Its great to have while traveling..
B00992CF6W|5.0|Before I got this app I thought that mc was just a copy of Legos now I know how much better Mc is
B0071XO8RA|1.0|Loved the series,  Hugh Howdy is a talented writer and I look forward to reading more of his work,  thanks!
B009NY43NY|4.0|I liked the plot but the romance portion left the reader hanging. It didn't work for me as a finale.
B009VSW15Y|5.0|I don't have a smart phone but with this a app I can take a photo of my art projects and post them on Facebook.
B000V39KDO|5.0|Have watched this many times!! Always awesome! Never get tired of it! Fantastic story and Gerald Butler was perfect for the movie!!
B005IQ39AY|4.0|I was looking for a game like this,  It's easy to play. My grand children like to play this game also.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I'd recommend this to any family. It quick and easy to learn. It is so funny hatching the baby animals. Please download this funny game.
B005544TRQ|3.0|This show is okay if you can get past the premis. There are far worse shows to watch and far more people on them who, in the real world, would be not only fired, but put in prison. The rhetoric is amusing and that is why I give it three stars. On the stupidity scale, it gets more stars than NCIS or Criminal Minds but less than Southland or Rescue Me. Rescue Me gets more stars because it's supposed to be stupid.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this book so much. I've read it and re re re read it every couple of month. Poor Peeta! But the truth is I love Gail. I can't take thus love triangle ,it's too much for my little Grinch heart.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Need this program on my phone since it is the industry standard in sending documents. It's amust have in the smartphone era.
B007MNV5WU|1.0|This game takes way too long to download. It usually doesn't take 20 minutes for games to download, and I tried pressing install again, but it would not load passed 5%.
B002OSAT7U|5.0|Huge deadmau5 fan and love pretty much all of the tracks on this album. Would definitely recommend to anyone who likes dance music. And even some who don't. :)
B004W4N55C|2.0|This app is awesome and works well on my HTC DNA, but crashes when I search for tabs on my nexus tablet. Fix that and it gets five stars.
B00000I0XW|5.0|To have a CD with Sarah Brightman singing an Andrew Lloyd Webber Collection is really a treat. I am a fan of Sarah Brightman and Andrew Lloyd Weber.
B00280LYIM|5.0|Trying not to get through it to fast.  I can't wait for the next movie. These books are addictive to read.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|One of the few Tom Cruise movies where I was actually sold on his character in the film instead of seeing him in another 'Tom Cruise' movie.
B00271HAK8|4.0|Great 80's movie shared with my teenage son.  Good quality stream! Funny watching it now as you look at Matthew Broderick and wonder how you could have considered him a high schooler with his 5 O'Clock shadow.  Still... my son didn't mind and enjoyed the movie for what it is.  Fun!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|My child loves this movie. We can get a little bit of extra sleep on the weekends because he will watch this movie. He doesn't watch t.v. so it is a very nice treat for everyone.
B001Q9J4PG|5.0|Can't  get any better than Tom Clancy. Jack Ryan for president I say! I'd put him on the ballot for sure
0307473708|5.0|The first book of the series that set forth the hit Showtime show. I recommend this book, irony, humor and a detail into the mind of a loveable anti-hero.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Excellent...hard to put down!  The horse really moves pretty good but the rider could use some work, looks stiff but I like that she pats the horse after competing.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Mitch Albom has done it again. What a great book. An easy read. Makes you appreciate the time you have.
B009NY43NY|5.0|After reading the first 12 books I was thrilled to see the 13th book come out. And it was just as wonderful as the first 12. Looking forward to book 14!!
1616550414|4.0|I was pretty excited for this because I've always enjoyed the Legend of Zelda games - at least up through Gamecube. I haven't played the more recent games. I was expecting more of an encyclopedia with full game walkthroughs/discussions, a bestiary, and things like that.<br /><br />That's not really what this is. It's more of a promotional tool for the upcoming game, Skyward Sword. The entire first half of the book is devoted to the development of Skyward Sword, actually. If you're like me, that's - uninteresting. I opened the book and start reading and I'm thinking, \\"What the hell is all of this?\\" Here I am expecting to see loads of concept art for the original NES games, A Link to the Past, Ocarina of Time, etc. With the exception of 8-10 pages devoted to Ocarina of Time, the other games aren't discussed in much detail.<br /><br />What this book does in the second half is essentially develop a timeline of events and discuss each game's place in the history of the legend.<br /><br />To make a long story short, there's a lot of good information and neat details, but it was ultimately a disappointment for someone like me who isn't a mega-fan, but more of a casual old-time fan.<br /><br />It looks nice on the table or in a bookcase after the few hours it takes to browse through it.
B007TKT2SK|4.0|Could have used this when my kids were learning how to do fractions. Very good app. Thanks for creating it.
B009H5IS1W|5.0|Love this show. This is one of my favorite seasons. It us different than other crime shows because they are not in the same city all the time. Must watch if you never seen before.
B00BU8RNCE|5.0|Cried my eyes out.  Guess I'm a sucker for emoting children.<br /><br />Seriously though, compelling imagery of the tsunami.  Fascinating view of human nature amidst chaos and panic.  The crucial pressure point a tiny gesture of kindness can make in turning the giant wheel of fate.
0375826742|5.0|Brisingr is the book i first read in the series and the book that got me into reading more books. I got the book for a Christmas present in 2011 so i had a lot of free time to read until school started, when i started reading it i could not stop reading i read and read until i fell asleep.<br />Brisingr the the third book in it's series out of 4. Eragon is the main character of the book series so it mostly focuses around him though we see other characters developing a lot, like his brother(Cousin)Roran for an example. We see Roran developing from a farmer boy into a one of the greatest warriors of the Varden, like his cousin Eragon.<br /><br />But even though i started the series with Brisingr i don't recommend it, since you will have missed a lot of things that are very important for the story.<br /><br />Christopher Paolini is a great writer and i hope to see more from him in the years to come, more about Eragon and other worlds.<br /><br />http://vaskur.ucoz.com/index/book_recommendation/0-4 - Check it out, my book recommendations
B0066WJLU6|5.0|This was only the second app that I got - actually, my son downloaded it for me.  It seems to work very nicely and will come in handy, I'm sure.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|Uses to traditional 'paper' interface with easy to use search to find the word you are looking for. Great dictionary.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Well worth it! I love this movie. I love anything Joss Wedon! My only complaint is having to watch the ten to fifteen minute preview\Marvel advertisement at the beginning that can't be skipped. But that's not the seller's fault. This item was shipped fast at a great price!<br /><br />If you're wondering about the movie itself, it is a tie-in from the respective Marvel Hero movies made before it by different directors. The dialogue is witty and realistic and relationship between the characters is intriguing. Whedon really risks it all as he trusts fan will follow the story lines in this movie from the individual movies that came before it and follow the story through its sequel(s) of both the individual movies and the Avengers sequel due out in 2015. I, for one, will follow and wait (im)patiently for more. No Cognitive Recalibration needed.
B001RHPJBU|5.0|If you don't know of Phil Collins you're probably very young... do yourself a favor and pick this up. You'll understand why so many people criticise newer music.<br /><br />This has all of my favorite songs by Phil Collins and I highly recommend it.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|If you were in junior high school during the airing of this soap, racing home across town not to miss more than the first fifteen minutes, you really don't want to miss out.  Tim Burton must have searched high and low at three decades worth of garage sales to dress the set for this film.  I swear I owned the four stoned pendant Michelle Pfeiffer is wearing in one scene; it was a Christmas present in 1968, long since disappeared, forgotten and now resurrected in true vampire fashion!  Not to mention shag rugs, posters on the wall and the totally accurate costumes.  Homage is evident even the appearances of actors and actresses, characters lovingly rendered as close as possible to the original players.  Only Depp is a little too pretty to ever pull off Barnabas.  Then again that may be an improvement.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I have thoroughly enjoyed this series. I like the caring and the humor and the spite. I have recommended this to several friends.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I read the book in one day! Two people help one another out in ways they aren't aware of at first. Happy and sad moments throughout the story.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|This is a wonderful game with great graphics. Keeps you entertained with various goals to achieve. Anyone who likes time management games will love this one!
B003XF1OJK|4.0|Great tale of the origin of the Spartans.  Brings a new meaning to the term super soldiers and the training
B004LWZWGA|4.0|I gave this 4/5 stars because of Christian Bale. I hate his Batman voice... it just grates on my nerves and sounds so fake.<br /><br />Other than that I loved the movie. It's a solid addition to the series and I recommended it to any Batman fan.
B00CL6HGIK|3.0|Everybody tries hard to rise above the melodrama of the script.  Gotta love Wahlberg who-- no matter what corniness-- manages to pull it off naturally.  The ending was a nice surprise.  Didn't see it coming and it pretty much saved the movie.
B009NY43NY|3.0|I had to read the last book in this series, just to see where she went with it. Besides my distaste for the ending (not a big deal, what author can please EVERYONE?) I just found this book lacking. It wasn't very funny. I'm glad I read it, but I was hoping for more.
B00947N6UG|5.0|Great movie, not at all what i expected.  We saw it on netflix prior to buying and amazon had a great price for a cute family movie.
006224454X|5.0|just got the book in the mail and i cant wait to start reading it! thank you so much! take care!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|It Is so fun I want to play it every day and my brother and sister have it too and I think you should get it too.<br /><br />,
0765326353|4.0|This book is very slow starting off. There's a wide cast of characters that took me longer than I preferred to become attached to. The world building is excellent and I enjoyed a lot of the elements involved but the story just takes way too long to get rolling for my tastes.<br /><br />With that being said, once everything DOES get rolling it gets good. Very good. I recommend this to anybody into epic fantasy and looking for a new world after WOT. It ends with a great set-up for book 2 and I'll definitely be preordering.
B009ZXT4BY|2.0|its fun but if it had more time than you can make more things so I recommend not to get this game!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I picked up this book having no idea what it was. I have now read it four times in 2 weeks
B003ZMF26W|5.0|This is a great mouse. The software is easy to use and makes the mouse highly customizable. I couldn't even figure out what to do with all possibilities. All around, a great mouse. Only one problem, however. The laser stopped working about 4 months after I got it, rendering it useless. If it hadn't broken, this would be five stars.<br /><br />Edit:<br />Cooler Master replaced my mouse and it is now on its way back to me. I am very satisfied, and have thus changed my rating to 5 stars as this mouse deserves.
0307949486|4.0|I understand i bought a used book and i cant expect the conditions to be good as new but i was expecting them to be a little better. But its ok, thank you so much for this buy cant wait to start reading now that i finished my classes!
B007Z9QP3K|5.0|This is a GREAT WWII movie for those people who like the time period. Sub titled, but very enjoyable, with a good plat and acting. Not to be missed if you are a WWII buff!
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is exactly what I wanted and it works perfectly. It gives hourly and daily weather reports and is fairly accurate. I couldn't ask for more.
B002Z58GQI|1.0|I hate this when I put my xbox live account on it and go around my mates house I have to config it again which then deletes my account then I have the re install it again I am so annoyed from this.
B00001W9G0|4.0|This movie is an oldie but goldie!  I forgot how touching it was.  It brings back a ton of great memories for me.
B008VVT51U|2.0|We had very poor quality streaming watching this movie.  It was jerky and at least twice the movie froze completely.  A big disappointment for the amount of money we paid to watch.  A star studded cast, but we didn't like the overall theme of the movie.
B004SBULWE|5.0|Does what I want it to. Kills running apps and background processes. Definitely worth downloading this app! Use it on all of my Android devices!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|A SUPER series, I about cried when the season was over and knowing I had to wait until the next one. Super storyline, wonderful actors, great story. DO NOT start watching it unless you watch it from the beginning of season 1. GREAT entertainment!
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|I loved the movie but it's sad to say goodbye to one of my favorite collection of characters. Highly recommended for... everyone.
B00A7W29BE|5.0|Could be sharper, with more enhancement options, but it fills your phone's scanner niche for a dollar. Or in this case free. I'm happy with it.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|I sometimes wonder why she chose the title &#34;Lean In.&#34; For a book whose purpose is to encourage woman to step up and lead, &#34;lean in &#34; is a rather weak title. But I guess the goal is to appeal to an insecure audience, one who needs encouragement. I have never had problems sitting at the table, raising my hand or dominating - but I have had problems getting people to follow me, and this is where the book really shines, where it shows the &#34;Catch-22&#34; women are in. If we are assertive we are branded as aggressive. Sanberg has much more useful advice for women who are afraid to speak up and assert themselves than she has for us assertive women who are finding leadership problematic. This is more of a book to encourage the under-achievers than one to train the achievers how to dominate. Still, I can recommend it and would encourage women in particular to read this before they embark on their careers, like in college.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Great attention to details...almost too much.  Very authentic.  Loved the stories of the different characters, their families and the connections between all of them.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I missed Season 1 and a friend recommended it. I &#34;think&#34; I liked it because I watched all 12 episodes in about four days. Then, I watched Season 2 in five days. I think it is beneficial to watch &#34;Homeland&#34; in sequence since the story line builds on earlier episodes.
B00B8WXG9G|4.0|If you enjoy the old Paul Anka, you will be pleased to see he hasn't changed.  His voice is still rich!
0553801473|5.0|I know there's a lot of complaints about the latest installment in the ASoIaF series but they are all minor. The book is superb. The writing is beautiful and just hearing about the characters feels magical.<br /><br />I love the book and, even though I know it won't be for years, can't wait for the next one.
B004XIZK5K|5.0|This is really explaining everything in depth. I was going to kettlebell trainings before, and it was 100% from this book! My trainer was precise, patient, and motivating, and now this wonderful manual helps me recover from laziness, and again to move, and act like a man.<br /><br />No, it's not the book, it's me who's working on myself. Without this book however, a lot of mistakes would've been made, that no doctor can repair.<br /><br />I recommend this to everyone devoted to live a happier, more active life.
B00COHAUD4|3.0|I could the movie a little long and very slow.  Just when I felt the movie was over, there was more...and that more was kinda still slow.  If you are thinking of renting it, Think a mixture of Harry Potter meets Poltergeist meets Driving Miss Daisy (only because it is SO SLOW).  Happy Watching!
B00AAX68HG|5.0|pudding monsters is a greag game for kids( 7-everyone) to do over the summer and be able to work there minds and have fun at the same time
B000N2HBSO|3.0|I was very interested in reading this book, but I'm struggling. It is a very detailed account of the time period and the key players, but the detail at times can be very dry.  If you are a big interest in Lincoln, the time period or history in general, you will like this book. I have found it very easy to put down and difficult to pick up again.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is one of few apps that Ive kept on my Kindle Fire HD since I got it. It is actually lots of fun with neat graphics. I only wish there were less ads.
B001UV4XI8|5.0|I loved the movie and remain a huge Harry Potter fan. The movies are just as magical as the books and I love each and every one!
B008BU75IQ|5.0|Archer is a favorite author of ours and we have loved all 3 books in the Clifton Chronicles. We are eagerly waiting for the next one!
B002NZV68U|4.0|&#34;Mumbler!  Seriously I can't understand a word you're saying.&#34;  This movie is quirky and fun.  Some of the lines crack me up and it still retains some of the oddness of the original.
B003THHIEM|5.0|This show is a light, funny crime show and a breath of fresh air when you've watched too many episodes of every other dark crime drama. Plus the chemistry between Castle and Beckett is so great!
B005PK56TA|5.0|I rarely watch TV & I don't have cable, so I had no idea what to expect with the series. As an Amazon Prime member the entire first season was free and I decided to investigate my curiosity with the show. After the first episode I was hooked and began to periodically watch each of the episodes from Season 1 in my free time on my SmartTv.
B00BGIBVP8|2.0|This movie was just ok. Had some funny moments, but it would have been better if it was shorter. Two and a half stars would be appropriate.
B007RTAR64|5.0|Bought this for a HUGE Hunger Games fan and they absolutely adore it. I think this Barbie may actually be a solid purchase for boys, girls and collectors alike.
B006M4F67A|5.0|This is a great game to play and works out your brain active. Suggest that EVERYONE, Take the time to download this App.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|A true hero.  I read through this about six months prior to Chris Kyle being murdered, and watch a couple interviews he did.  I appreciate his very detailed accounts and the personal side he relays.  It will help the average read see deeper into lives of service.
B008133MDK|5.0|This show is simply amazing. I am hooked. So much intrigue, clever dialogue, humor... The best Sherlock I've ever seen.
B002J3ELR4|3.0|Wanna watch Akroyd, Belushi, Candy, kick their heels way up in a wild movie? This is the one.<br /><br />Problem is: too much heel kickin' for too long a time...hilarious scenes, against terrific cinematography, ultimately do not constitute a great movie. Laurel and Hardy, Three Stooges, The Marx Brothers, could get away with crazy scenes and no continuity, mostly because they made 17 minute, to 70 minute movies. Two hours? No way.<br /><br />Another issue, is that the premise, six days after Pearl harbor, La-La Land, unprepared for nothing more than jitterbugging and zoning out at the movies, suddenly becomes (somewhat) useful in the War effort, suggests that only the most darkly, surreal, carefully constructed, piece of art, can sustain. Yes, there are stretches of genius: Akroyd is is charge of Airplane maintenance (as I recall) and he takes on the proportions of John Wayne as he approaches a local family about installing a huge weapon in their backyard. The humor is perfectly realized, as good as anything the actor did on Saturday Nite Live...but against the reality of December 7th, it loses alot of lustre and we have something in very bad taste.<br /><br />It's been said that Spielberg thought a \\"Hollywood Musical\\" [in the Mickey Rooney-Judy Garland mode] would be the ticket but he was convinced a fairly straight ahead \\"drama with comedy\\" would be better.<br /><br />If Spielberg did the musical, then the movie would have fit in to the \\"Airplane\\" genre and been a lot more..respectable.<br /><br />The movie *is* successful at being consistently funny while paying tribute to JAWS, DR. STRANGELOVE, AIRPLANE!, TORA TORA TORA (never saw it but another Reviewer here says it fits), THE RUSSIANS ARE COMING, and probably other films we assume Steve S. loved, coming up.<br /><br />But check it out if you can, as a used item here on Amazon..and watch it...piece by piece...or as a string of SNL sketches.<br /><br />[Review based upon Theatre / TMC viewing].
B00BLCHYKU|4.0|It would be nice to have some indication of what parts are historically accurate and which are pure fiction - it is from the history channel after all.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Coolest game ever you to play it. U could  creat stuff it is also fun you got to see it to believe it
B00A7W29BE|5.0|Yes, it's true you can use your camera and any number of photo/gallery apps to do what Genius Scan does but unlike most photo apps Genius Scan is clearly designed for scanning text. The scans can be automagically tweaked to make the text more readable and the program seems to know how to choose the format that will produce the smallest file size.<br /><br />It's connectivity is also a nice bonus and it's trivial to send your scans to cloud storage like google drive or directly to your computer through a bluetooth connection.<br /><br />It's not an elaborate app and if you rarely scan text you might as well just use your camera but just today I scanned 3 pages of a Journal article using Genius Scan and ran it through OCRFeeder and everything worked beautifully.<br /><br />Genius Scan is simple, well thought out and does what it says and does it well.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book is excellent!  I enjoyed the many small details added that may be overlooked by readers.  A quick read and worth the purchase.
B00597A6NU|4.0|Very good acting.  Good team work as well. The movie captured the hardship and luck of the crew. Highly recommend.
B008MWBY6W|5.0|This is a nice gab for daily outdoor trip, Very nice material, helpful 2 dedicated slots for SD memory cards. I am using it for my Nikon D7100 with Nikon 18-300mm lens.
193700788X|4.0|spoiler alert<br /><br />To say that Sookie never showed interest in Sam just shows the selective memories on some people. Anyone remember book 5???Sookie proved herself to be one of those people who just doesn't see what was right under her nose.  Let's face it.  Eric and Sookie were over for a while and dragging out the break up.  Sam's \\"death\\" just happened at the perfect time. I will always support Sookie. She did a good job of making a clean break from vampires and her relationship was a healthy choice.  I do agree that the books have some inconsistencies and what I don't get is shouldn't there a person whose entire job it is to find and fix such things? But whatever- I applaud Mrs.Harris.  I don't have the attention span to write more than a short story myself.
B00AESN8XY|3.0|Boring. That's all I can say... You can spend a half hour watching the screen! Ugh, it is soooooooo boring.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|It's a match-3 game but with the added difficulty of monster fighting. Okay so you don't get to actually fight per se, but you have to scan the board for specific kinds of matches while watching your little guy running across the top, and make matches that help him battle monsters or open chests. It's a little more difficult than a regular match-3, and it is so very addicting!
B00BHXUC4S|5.0|He is an amazing talent and his first solo album was some of his best music! I'm surprised he didn't have more hits off of this album because every song is fantastic!
B00BF11STU|3.0|Some scenes were like watching paint dry. It should not take 5 minutes to show a person waiting to get on a plane. It was hard to follow the story at times as well. It did seem realistic.
B0083SBMBM|3.0|My husband wanted this movie and when he watched it, just thought it was ok.  Which stunned me because of the reviews it had.  We are big fans of Iron Man and Thor which is why we wanted it.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|I loved this show when it first came out. It is every bit as good today as it was then. Worth every viewing minute.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|ES File Explorer works very well! I needed to access my kindle's pictures and I really wanted to watch videos on it but was unable to until I found this partial window explorer.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is a good source of entertainment.  I myself don't play it, but my daughters do and it really keeps them busy.
B008BU75IQ|2.0|Archer wrote a trilogy and got bored at the end. He can tell a good story, this was disappointing. Seemingly he had no plan and finished number three purely for for the sake of it. Wonder how the pay structure worked?
B00CHILW64|5.0|excellent performances, cared about family.  Very evenly pace, oldest son exceptional.  Survival, family,, qnd kindness of strqngers in a straneg land.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|This was a very good read. I stopped everything to finish this book. Great! It felt like a real life story.
B00AEBB8FQ|3.0|Different conceept but good movie. Definitely  worth watching. The acting in this is very entertaining .i think most people will enjoy it.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|IT'S SO UNFORTUMATE THAT THIS MAN NAMED &#34;SUGAR MAN&#34; AND THE TALENTS HE HAD COULD NOT BE SHARED WITH THE WORLD.  HE DIDN'T CARE AT ALL FOR  ALL THE &#34;LIMELIGHT&#34; AND MONEY THAT GOES ALONG WITH TALENT LIKE HIS.  VERY INFORMATIVE AND EDUCATIONAL.  HISTORICALLY WONDERFUL!!!
B0071MQBX0|5.0|This is terrific not only because of the masterful performances, but also the post-show performances of previous Phantom stars and  Webber's comments.
B00COGY2P2|2.0|The movie itslef was great, but I ordered an HD movie for $5.99  The quality of the movie was terrible, no better than non-HD, if that.  There was nothing wrong with my equipment as I'd just watched another HD movie from Direct TV and it was just fine. I should ask for my money back!!
1449410243|5.0|I have never laughed so hard in my life.  I think I acutally did pee myself!  I am sure the author is some where in a deeply-padded, secured room somewhere where people actually get where he is coming from.
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|the confidence, cockiness, self assuredness etc, did not come across as natural.  I will always watch Tom Cruise movies.  I like him, but not one of his better acting jobs.  The movie overall was good.  Will watch any sequel should there be any.
B006MW3UZW|3.0|They're were a lot of freezes and delays, especially when adding subtitles, that put a damper on our experience with HD. Fortunately downton abbey makes up for that and brings it to an average 3 stars.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It is great! I am attached to it like there is no tomorrow. If you get it, it's free well spent.
B00BLF9FOK|5.0|Dirty, gritty, over the top and darkly hilarious. This movie has everything an action movie should have. Schwarzenegger proves yet again why he is the face of the over the top fun. There's gatling guns, 200 mph car chases, gun fights every twenty minutes and down home honest living. By the end of this movie I was literally audible with excitement. The fight scenes will blow you away. We've had to deal with fight scenes that are so close you can't tell what's going on. Not with this movie, the camera work is absolutely perfect. The gore effects of gunshot wounds are actually realistic and the firepower is enough to satisfy any action fan. The dialogue is pretty well done, the story line is simple but perfect for an action flick, the soundtrack is rocking and the stylized cinematography is great.<br /><br />I really can't express how much I loved this movie. Easily one of Schwarzenegger's best and easily one of the best to come out this year.
B009HUB40Y|5.0|It rocks kids in tube socks. This game is more fly than an air plane. If this game was a burger it would be the big Mac. This game rocks harder than granite.
1452110581|5.0|These are wonderul poems from a cat's perspective.  I really needed something to lighten the work load I was experiencing and this put it all in perspective.
B008TTPQXA|5.0|A scientific and careful detailing of a miraculous recovery and the beauty that awaits everyone on death. I am a biologist and understand that there needs to be biological proof of death and/or the cognitive abilities for this to be plausable.  I have just lost a beloved six year old grandson and have been absolutely shattered by his death.  Dr Eben Alexander's book has given me so much comfort.
B009GXHOW4|5.0|I have the full version and it is great as well as the free version, but I think that you should be allowed to edit the config (configure) too for both versions
B001TH16DI|5.0|This was bought as a gift. Haven't heard anything bad about it, so guess it was a good buy. Online shopping for Christmas is always fun.
B00AO2P3GA|3.0|if u do not what ur kid to play it I will read some reviews<br />and see if I can see reviews and if any reviews say if the<br />game has bad words but all I know is it is awesome<br />but the game did have nice blood n Gore?
B00CW665VI|5.0|Was a quick read it just sucks you in I absolutely love it! It really makes you feel like a part of the characters. Just awesome. So worth it!
B008LVCKH6|5.0|One of the best books I read<br />Thrilling to the last moment .  Characters work so well together.  Mr Old so unassuming - just takes things in stride.  More of us should be like him.  Thats what is important in life.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I got this book for free thinking it was pretty self explanatory about waking up to a stranger in Vegas. This book exceeded my expectations. Such a wonderful read. It was romantic and funny and charming. It didn't have pointless words to make a book longer or items that weren't needed. It was just about the characters. I loved how they grew and evolved and sucked you into their romance. I'm ready to read the rest of her books :)
B0066WJLU6|5.0|Pretty cool little gadget. Very useful in the dark, and rather quick of operation. Download was easy and problem free. I can recommend it.
B0058YPL66|5.0|I was happy to hear the our son's girlfriend was so happy to get this for Christmas. Have bought from here before and will again.
B001UGB1X8|5.0|I like Tommy Lee Jones movies so this one is up there with some of his best ones. John Goodman was good as well.
0307476464|4.0|This is the 4th book I've read by Haruki Murakami, the others being The Wind Up Bird Chronicles, A Wild Sheep Chase and Kafka on the Shore, all of which I found very different, quirky and very much enjoyed.<br /><br />In 1Q84 I like the premise of an alternate world with the 2 moons and the Little People - far fetched for sure - but that is part and parcel of a Murakami story. It was a different experience, however, to find that the end worked out the way I thought it might, although, as in the other novels I've read, there were still many questions left hanging, which I like rather than always having everything add up at the end.<br /><br />I thought the characters were well written and interesting. Some may find a few scenes offensive and although Murakami writes them in a detailed way, the descriptions are exaggerated and somehow emotionally detached which makes the events seem unreal and therefore less offensive.<br /><br />I was fascinated by the introduction of cults and their followers and the parallels drawn between them and the harm that overbearing, single-minded parents can have on their children. I also love the metaphors he creates and the images he paints. \\"A ragged line of sparrows sat on an electrical line, constantly switching positions like musical notes being rewritten.\\" How elegant is that?<br /><br />But, regardless of all this, there is so much repetition it ruined the book for me. Murakami repeated words in neighbouring sentences when an alternative word, in my opinion, could and should have been used; he repeated key phrases over and over again, for example, \\"said Fuka-Eri without a question mark\\", and \\"ho ho says the keeper of the beat\\", possibly a device meant to set a mood or emphasise an image but something that I found irritating; and most annoying of all, on many occasions he summarised chunks of the action which I felt insulted my intelligence (yes... I have been paying attention) and was boring.<br /><br />1Q84 is a long book and I think that if the repetition had been edited out it would have reduced the book substantially and made it into a more enjoyable read. Sorry Murakami, you write beautifully, but all that repetition? It ruined the book for me.ink that if the repetition had been edited out it would have reduced the book substantially and made it into a more enjoyable read. Sorry Murakami, you write beautifully, but all that repetition? It ruined the book for me.
B004UID2LC|2.0|good but sometimes it acts like a virus and u can't get on it but I hope it works great for you I didn't for me though
B003B02O7I|4.0|After page two I could not stop reading!  Another great book from John Grisham.  There are twists and turns right up to the page.
B005OYKI1I|5.0|Don't look for any deep messages or meaning. Fast cars and fun. If you're watching with young viewers there is a few more short skirts and shorts that I think was necessary.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|since the update it kinda lags but I love it. its cool and in style. all the kids are playing it.
B000001ZS8|5.0|Very cool cd
0062080237|4.0|A big book in many interpretations of that word! The characters, humans and gods alike, leap off the page and grab your attention to pass on their message. The premise is that gods exist because people believe in them and as the belief in the gods that immigrants brought with them to the US decreases and new gods arise reflecting the modern technical age, there is going to be a showdown.  I enjoyed it very much but why did Neil Gaiman miss out the Gods of Christianity, Judaism & Islam? I'd like to ask him one day.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|This game is the best I've played and it'll be one of the best you will play to get it
B002WV5A9G|4.0|Good movie, stays pretty true to the original.  Can't miss with a Star Trek movie! Thanks for bringing it back!
0316017930|4.0|I lost my book and need a new one. This book has helped me a lot and I passed the class.  Come on time and it was new.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I wasn't sure I'd  like this book but I did! If you like to read something with a little bit of magic in it, a love story and even a little bit of history, you'll llike this book. It keeps you guessing at the beginning and rooting for the characters at the end. There is a little bit of the Hunger Games type of competition in it between the 2 main characters but they are determined to overcome the pre-destined adversarial fight to the death that their mentors have set them up for. I found this book easy to read and the descriptions of the circus very vivid and fascinating.
B003PPDIC4|5.0|This book is an absolute pleasure to read. The science is well-researched and is presented in a fascinating way. Arthur C Clarke has a beautiful writing style. It is incredible to believe that it was written 44 years ago. I have no idea why I have never read this novel before!
B004GXKBFQ|5.0|With Jeremy Sumpter and Rachel Hurd-Wood staring as their roles as Peter Pan and Wendy Darling, they deliver the greatest performances that the movie industry has ever seen.  They bring the two greatest characters to life and don't fail to leave us wanting more!<br /><br />Jason Issacs makes a great Hook and Mr. Darling.  He does a great job capturing the attention of both characters!  It will leave you wondering how he does it!<br /><br />This is so highly recommendable, that it will leave you wanting a sequel to this amazing movie!
B00594XOZU|4.0|This is the best app ever you can send pic and face on a kindle but on other thing like iPods you can send videos 100% not far  So needs updates but can't leave with out it
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This was a captivating book from the beginning. I had a really hard time putting it down! I recommend this to anyone who loves a gripping crime novel!
B0054R6BFM|5.0|While I was reading this book, someone asked me if it was sad, because of the premise of the novel. I, however, found it inspiring and somehow rooting for the main characters. To this day, I'm still thinking about all of the questions and meanings behind this well written novel.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|This is a great game, I love how you have to feed two monsters. That idea was amazing! The best thing is that it was so cheap. I love it!
0515153656|4.0|With Jack Reacher as the new hero of our modern day society, no bad guy is getting away with anything!<br /><br />A highly recommendable novel!
B008N1V11U|5.0|The game has great graphics and is easy to control Batman to end the siege over Gotham City and convince the people of Gotham that Batman didn't kill Harvey Dent!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Totally sleep deprived since I have downloaded this game! Very addictive, loads of fun with game modes. Hard to put down.

B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I was surprised because this book was so different than what I expected. Really different and I found myself laughing out loud. If you think that you know the story, think again. This is not the same as the movie.
B00A0MJA1I|5.0|This movie is highly recommendable for children of all ages!  The characters are amazingly written!  Wendy Darling will leave you wanting more performances from her!

B005Z5F5VE|5.0|Opinions are opinions, I can understand if some don't agree. I've been listening to U2 since I was 4, and have gone through all of their albums (my first version of this album was actually on tape!), this one is my favorite by far. I feel that there is no song that goes to waste on this album, and at their live concerts they usually play many of the songs from this album for a reason. I definitely recommend it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I'm only on Tokyo right now but it is so much fun I can't wait for the update I hope you guys get this game too if you like temple run you will love this

125000098X|5.0|I've been waiting for this one. Haven't read it yet but I'm sure it will be just as good as the others.<br /><br />Well, I finished it and like the others it was excellent!  Also, like the others, it leaves you hanging and waiting anxiously for the next one!
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Lots of excitement. I do like Jack Teachers friendship and interaction with women ,  Jack Teacher with an R not T is the hero's name. This review is now wrong.
B001XRLWPQ|4.0|&#34;Firefly&#34; superstar, Nathan Fillion, appears as his greatest character of all time!<br /><br />This series is filled with suspense and crime to last a life time!
B002O2THRO|3.0|Starts out well but the last, and most important, twenty minutes or so are bungled if you know the book.
B004W2UBYW|3.0|Maybe the acid affected his personality, what a piece of work.  Book was very long, but very in depth, I should have skimmed then read the last two chapters carefully.
B004SRPXWQ|2.0|I first saw this app on my Mom's iPad and it was rather amusing.  However, the Kindle version is either not well written or the Kindle microphone is weak as I have to shout to get it to hear me.  With the iPad version it picked up soft voices from others nearby.  Not on the Kindle though.  It's just a novelty.  You try it a couple times and move on to other things.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|I had heard a lot about Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore by Robin Sloan, and I finally got to the top of the library hold list. The people who told me about it were right... it's a very good read that's quite different than most novels I've experienced lately.<br /><br />Bookstore starts off a little on the slow side, probably because the main character, Clay Jannon, is working a job that seems to be completely illogical. What's the purpose of someone working a graveyard shift in a 24-hour bookstore that never seems to sell any books? But it picks up as Jannon starts trying to figure out who the book borrowers are, and why the books they're borrowing appear to be nothing more than collections of random characters. There are a number of mysteries within mysteries to be solved, and they're all wrapped in a centuries-old society that no one has ever heard of.<br /><br />On top of the story (which I thought was interesting with a number of things to consider), the dialogue style was perfect for pulling the reader into a one-on-one experience with Jannon's situation and thoughts about what's going on and what it all means.<br /><br />I'd definitely recommend Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore with the warning that you might need some uninterrupted time before you start reading. I found it very hard to put down...<br /><br />Disclosure:<br />Obtained From: Library<br />Payment: Borrowed
B005IA9JZO|5.0|After a play, a cartoon, and a tv series about one of the greatest stories ever created in history, we are finally rewarded with a \\"live-action\\" film that brings the world of Peter Pan to life and gives us the greatest emotional experience of all time!<br /><br />Okay, I will admit, I was laughing at the idea that this movie even existed.  I mean, \\"Peter Pan, all grown up, married, and has kids\\", that wasn't the original Peter Pan that I knew at all.  I at first thought it was a bad idea that this movie was even made and I made fun of it.  But then... I found out that Steven Spielberg himself directed the movie and everything changed.  I watched it and I my mouth hang open from shock after the movie was over.  \\"Hook\\" is one of the greatest adaptions ever created in the history of Peter Pan!<br /><br />The story is very simple.  Peter Pan has grown up, having fallen in love with a girl named Moira, who happens to be the granddaughter of the now elderly Wendy Darling.  Having married Moira and had two kids, our hero has forgotten his time in Neverland and has become a regular person. But when Hook returns and kidnaps his children, Peter must return to Neverland, regain his memories, and team back up with the Lost Boys in order to save his children, while finally face his deadliest nemesis for the final time.<br /><br />With the work of the greatest director of all time, Steven Spielberg, Hook turned out to be one of the greatest movies of all time.  Steven Spielberg delivers his version of Peter Pan and shows us what happens when the \\"boy who wouldn't grow up\\" actually grows up.  Dustin Hoffman plays a great villain inside Hook, bringing his evil side to life and also showing us what he would be like in real life if he was real.  Robin Williams delivers his best performance as a older Peter Pan, showing us his life without Neverland.  Maggie Smith and Gwyneth Paltrow create such awesome versions of Wendy Darling, who has lived a full life and has us tearing up at howthings used to be in the old days.<br /><br />The emotion inside this story is so heartfelt and beautiful, you will literally cry.  Rufio, the Lost Boys (including elderly Tootles), Wendy, Tinkerbell, and even Peter himself make the best moments of this movie so worth watching.  Old characters like Wendy and Tootles will have you missing the old times when they were all young and going on adventures with Peter.  Rufio and the Lost Boys provide the greatest fun and adventures for us to watch and be entertained by.  And Peter will give you the most greatest story about learning to deal with your past and moving on.  Just his old saying \\"to die would be awfully big adventure\\", he now understands that \\"to live would be an awfully big adventure\\".  You will be loving the emotion from all around the movie.<br /><br />This film was done so beautifully and amazingly, that we are able to call this \\"the greatest Peter Pan movie of all time\\"!<br /><br />This movie is very highly recommendable for Peter Pan fans.  You will not be disappointed! Even kids will love it too! :)
B008LV8TSU|5.0|I just watched the movie.  I actually finished this book about a week ago and have since read the next one which I just finished.  If you have seen the movie, the book is better.  The movie is a rare thing, its based on the book loosely and its good in its own way while the book is very different and better.<br />If you haven't seen the movie, you should.  But you should read the book too.<br />Its an amazing and full world with very interesting characters that you really get to know.

B000BNI99K|5.0|Wonderful music performed to perfection.  Hours of enjoyment listening to the music of Cole Porter, Ira & George Gershwin, Rogers & Hart, Sammys Cahn & Cooke, Hoagie and Duke.  Just great!
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|My son and I watched Wreck-It Ralph and both enjoyed it on different levels and some on the same. For example, the little girl racer who can't get over his playing in a game, &#34;Hero's Duty,&#34; and the Ed Winn comes alive character that keeps her from even getting a car were both adorable for any age.
B004GYY714|4.0|I like KBAY but they only offer the Google Play version of their app for Android.  Now with this I can listen to my station on my Kindle.  It is missing some local stations like KNBR that I listen to for the Giants games but iHeart gives us that one so with both apps I'm covered.
B000HKYOK0|5.0|A great spiff of Amazon Prime membership is access to classic shows like Star Trek. While I've only streamed a few episodes from season one, those I have watched ran without a hitch. These are myth-making adventures that set the stage for everything that followed, including the latest big-budget spectacle in theaters. Highly recommended for fans of science fiction and quality drama.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|It is an interesting experience populating the reef. It is very colorful and dynamic. I have enjoyedt this new experience.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I read about 2 chapters and deleted it. James is not a good writer and if this book had been about any other subject it would have flopped. There is nothing worse then reading a book that plods along as if it is written by a grade 12 high school student's essay on bondage. Can't wait for the movie!!!!!!

B003VS0CKG|3.0|Well written, concise, informative. A nice mellow read for those in the L2 profession, or those looking to enter it.
1577314808|5.0|The Power Of Now is toward the top of my list of books that make you think (or in this case, stop thinking). In short, it is somewhat Buddhist philosophy that goes like this: The past is gone and only exists in your memories. The future only exists in your head, as well. The only thing that is real is the present. And, if you would just stop thinking so much about the past and the future, you could enjoy the present. That's pretty much the book in just a few sentences.<br /><br />Personally, I had a death of a family member as a young teenager that affected me for many, many years after it happened. I really think my life might have been different if someone had explained to me back then that I had the power to just stop thinking about it.<br /><br />On the other hand, it is silly to think that the past just disappears. For example, a Southern California middle school teacher was recently fired for appearing in a pornographic movie. The film was produced well before she became a teacher. It is clear here that what she did in her past affected both her present and her future. Eckhart Tolle's advice in \\"The Power of Now\\" might make her present more enjoyable for her personally, but the bottom line is, nobody else is just going to magically forget about her past (career wise, anyway).<br /><br />But kudos to Eckhart Tolle for not only writing a whole book explaining the benefits of \\"stopping to smell the roses,\\" but doing so in a masterful way. Used in moderation, the information could benefit much of America, whose unchecked egos have caused much misery and pain.<br /><br />For anyone interested in \\"The Power Of Now,\\" I'm going to suggest the book, \\"The Untethered Soul: The Journey Beyond Yourself,\\" by Michael A. Singer. It contains some of the same concepts, but, in my opinion, in a kinder and gentler way.  Perhaps, it is a little less, \\"just stop thinking\\" than Eckhart Tolle, but still explains some of the dangers of the unchecked ego fairly well.
0739352989|1.0|The reason this book is so popular is that it can be hard to find erotica geared towards women.  Unfortunately, this option in particular is horribly written, with obnoxious characters and mediocre sex scenes.  It's also a terrible example of an D/s lifestyle, and Christian comes across not as a dominant but a creepy, controlling pseudo-rapist.  Anastasia doesn't come across as submissive so much as REALLY ANNOYING.  If I hear the phrase \\"inner goddess\\" again I'm liable to hit someone, and NOT in a sexy way.<br /><br />Don't waste your time or money.  There's so much better out there.
B00AKFG15S|5.0|Jeffrey Archer always keeps your interest; he's always got a surprise for you. He makes you want to keep reading and, of course, longing for his next book in the sequel.<br />I highly recommend the series.
B002BVQU5A|5.0|What can Johnny Depp not do!  This film is one of my favorites.  Not many I can watch again and again, but this one makes me laugh out loud, all by myself.  Johnny Depp's potato dance is worth the whole film.

193700788X|5.0|Actually it is written by one of my favorite authoris, Charlaine Harris, I have read all of her Sookie Stackhouse novels and enjoyed them enough to read them again and again.<br /><br />This final book in the series of 13 left me wanting at the end, but as I know an authori know's their character better than I do (as the reader) and so her end of this series is her own.<br /><br />In my mind I am happy that I still have the TV True Blood series to look forward to because in that show Sookie is able to continue.  Casting in this show is fabulous and so I can accept the characters better there than in this final book.<br /><br />Love it though and it stays in my library collection of hard covers.
B00AZMFJYA|1.0|From the bad storyline to the surprisingly poor acting to Kirk's lipstick, I couldn't have been more disappointed in this movie.  The special effects were adequate for this day and age, but they lose gravity and everything starts falling?  And then when they're in free fall, there's gravity?  Really.... Kahn's blood?  Give me a break.  At least the popcorn at the movie theater was good.  Save your money.  Maybe the next one will be better.
B00BSWMITK|5.0|Slip the disc in the car and drive.  Before you know it you are where you were going and time has gone by quickly.
B0052AC8C6|4.0|I enjoyed it.  It was very well done and the story line was good.<br />Voice acting was very good.  Still no way to give it 5 stars.<br />Worth watching
0345803493|4.0|I don't know what all the fuss about this book is... it's a love story between two consenting adults that shows the many, many facets of enjoying each other sexually... nothing to SM as I was believed it would be.  I like the book.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book, like all of the Hunger Games trilogy. The plot holds you. It is a PAGE TURNER. I highly recommend this book and the complete series.
B009KHCT94|4.0|The last thing the world expected was an attack by Nazi's from the moon.<br />I was bored ,my wife was away and I had read a quick review so I &#34;rented it for less from Amazon.&#34;<br />Still I wasn't prepared for the actual plot of this&#34;attack earth from space&#34; adventure .<br />If you like the old time Sci-Fi movies like &#34;Invaders From Mars&#34;,&#34;War of the Worlds&#34;,&#34;This Island Earth&#34; and the crazy spoof &#34;Mars Attacks&#34; with Jack Nicholson you will definitely like this.<br />It's a &#34;Little&#34; more serious than Mars Attacks [closer to the other three] with better special effects.<br />I enjoyed it enough to watch it again with my son in law the next day.
B0042J6VUS|4.0|I like the little stand. very useful. I would have liked it to stand tall but for the price it is well worth it.
0765326353|5.0|Brandon Sanderson has become my favorite author. And it happened with this book. World building on another level. Characters you believe in. A story so intriguing I never noticed its 1000 page length. All I knew when it was over was that I wanted more. A

B0035JRVBO|5.0|As part of my son's vietnam war history study, we viewed this movie.  This is so much more than just a review of the 60's-70's.  So many issues touched upon with sensitivity...this is a &#34;can't we all just get along even though we might be a little different&#34; classic!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This app is so handy!  Can switch from weather now, to forecast , to radar map with ease! Love swiping front city to city too.
B004LWZW4M|5.0|This is a much better movie and storyline than the original Conquest of the Planet of the Apes.  I usually turn off movies after the actors/actresses are listed in the credits at the end of the movie, but fortunately did not as there is another minute or so of the movie that explains the title Rise of the Planet of the Apes.  Wow! I enjoyed this movie very much and would definitely recommend it for any Planet of the Apes fan.
B0081336FO|5.0|just now i submitted a review of sherlock 1...season 2 was everybit as well written, cast and acted... quality production i have recommended this 2 part series to several people... my only complaint is i dont think there will be a season 3
1592400876|5.0|My son used this book as part of his prep for the SAT.  He enjoyed reading it and learned a lot.  This book wasn't your typical dry &#34;grammar&#34; book -it was a fun read.

B004RJMUJO|1.0|The new update just ruined the whole experience for me. Now my avast security app keeps saying that fruit ninja is a spam. Fix it now!!! We bought the app to have fun not to get frustrated.
B00CS65JS2|3.0|Given all the hype and marketing leading up to the release, Random Access Memories was doomed to fail in living up to expectations.  Not unhappy that I bought the album, but my world wasn't changed because of it.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I'm a little behind on this whole fad, but I borrowed Seasons 1 & 2, so of course I had to buy Season 3 once it was available.  I'm a history teacher, so one of the draws of this series is its historicity - pretty accurate portrayal, from what I've seen so far.

B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is a well designed game for those who enjoy a challenge! Good graphics. No boring story to detract from the game.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Really fun game. They did a good job on making it not too hard and not to easy. I will definitely keep an eye out for more of their games.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|There occasionally comes along a book that speaks to women's experience and nails it.  Manifesta was the last book I remember reading like this.  So often, women's experience on the job and at home is not really talked about frankly, or with a lot of insight.  Not only does this book have insight, it has facts, and sociological research and data to back it up.  I wanted to get 20 copies and give them all to my women friends, and then I thought, maybe my men friends leave it more.  Then I fantasized about leaving it at the gym and doctor's offices.  Read this book, no matter who you are - your mother, your sister, your spouse, your daughters (should you be so fortunate to have them!) will be glad you understand!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Does what it should do . I would recommend it to any body that is looking for a way to monitor their battery usage. Good app must have.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|The first four books of Ice and Fire were fascinating and had all the elements of fiction that I find entertaining.  This book started with the same intensity, but as I moved past the middle, it stopped holding my attention.  Martin actually seemed to be trying to decide how to finish and tie up all the loose ends.<br />  When I read the final chapter, I used some crude expletives because there was NO ending.  I quickly researched to learn that two more books are coming.  Who knew??!!  If a large portion of this book's fat had been trimmed, it wouldn't have left me quite so unsatisfied.  I will start the next installment when it is published, but it better have claws or I'll put The Hobbit back at the top of my list for this genre.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This book is SO good! So much action and laughter. Although, it may be inappropriate for ten and under. I believe that Ernest should make a second book, maybe the Sixers come back and overthrow Parzival, and then he has to fight back. I hope that everyone out there gets a chance to read this book.

B00BWBHIUG|1.0|WHY?! Why must my son and I get addicted to games and get so far only for the the game to freeze crash and just stop working. We got all the way to level 13 when it stopped working and kept saying server down connection not available. I know my server isn't down because my connection is working just fine and yet still it won't let us play anymore! This same thing happened with the Monster Pet Shop game. I hate getting hooked only to loose my game fix! Grrr!

B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Fun game enjoyed playing does not seem to be any issues at this point just rating so it will stop asking
B001ANSSDC|2.0|I didn't get the humor that the previous readers saw in this book.  It lagged for me.  I didn't finish it.  Obviously, the movie might be better than the book in this case.
B0063M22QO|1.0|Hate it.  No instructions that make sense to me.  No score. No going to next level.  No idea where I am going or where I am supposed to go.
B000GCFG7E|5.0|I have a mentally challenging job, and I like being able to crash at night with Jack Reacher stories.  Number 10 is just what the doctor ordered.  I like the fast pace and the good guy rising to the occasion. Getting him to the top is where the action is and Lee Child keeps the suspense going right up to the end.  The bad guys really should be able to track him down though just by following his pile of used clothing!!!  Love it.
B005PK56TA|5.0|What a great season! Lots of twists/turns in the story line. I actually prefer Season 1, just couldn't get into Season 2.

B005MLOOJA|5.0|Basically, a soap opera with a legal/political story line and strong acting. The cast is fantastic--Christine Baranski, Chris Noth, Archie Punjabi, Juliana Margulies, and cameo roles (Bill Irwin, Jerry Stiller).  Can't watch just one!
B00BGICGJ8|1.0|Way too long, it dragged on forever and wasn't very funny. Even though I purchased this movie I didn't watch the whole thing because I got bored.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|This was very fun and engaging, well worth the purchase. I enjoyed the hidden object games and the story line a lot. Definitely will buy other g5 games.
B004ELSDZK|4.0|This game is a hoot! Lots of dialog from Totemo to keep you interested and the graphics are so cool!
B005K17RU0|2.0|I don &quot;t see this as an upgrade. The older version had larger, clearer, graphics. I was able to check the weather without using glasses. I don &quot;t need a graph of highs and lows especially when I must use glasses to see the information on the axes. I also find the outdoor exercise notation contradictory : on a day with a high Ozone warning it said outdoor exercise was a great idea. Is there a way I can go back to the unupgraded version?
B00AEFZ2DG|5.0|I love this movie for the history as well as how well Steve Zahn and Matthew McConahey play together!  They are funny!  Its an older movie but destined to be a classic at this house!
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|Creative writing and an excellent cast make this one of the better shows I've seen in a while on non-premium channels.

B0047Y0FGY|5.0|This book is tough to put down and with every page another dose of Tina's ideas come storming at you. You can never anticipate what's coming because she has such an unique outlook on life that you embrace it and fall in love with the book.
B0074VA2T2|3.0|It would be nice if the actual book was part of the app.  Decent app to help children with matching and counting.
B00BC24NT4|1.0|too disjointed to maintain an interest.  Not my type of book.<br />Why do I have to write an X number of words.  A few are sufficient
B0092SQ5EG|5.0|After seeing this documentary I see Katy in a totally different light. I love how she became a success being true to herself. Cried so hard when she was going through her divorce from Russell, to see her in pain was heartbreaking. Five Stars, Great Documentary
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use Evernote to write articles and stories or sometimes make to-do lists and such. it is so easily accessible and I LOVE it!!! I would definately recommend it to anyone who lies organization and writing.
B002PEP4SC|4.0|I have been watching the Richard Castle series on TV and wondered if the books were as good as the series. I think i picked the wrong book to read first because I couldn't get past the name Jameson Rook instead of Richard Castle. If I would have read the book first I wouldn't have had that problem. It was a good book but I like the series better.
1455523550|5.0|I found out why this book remained on the Best Seller list for WEEKS.<br />Nicholas Sparks has the gift of writing in a way that keeps you most interested and draws you right into the story.<br />He also puts a twist into every one of his books. I am hooked on his stories.
B00BP4WAZS|2.0|I expected so much more.  The trailers gave me the impression of nestalga of the arcade games of the 80's.  but that is not what this game is about at all.  It has a very poor story line.  I ended the movie early.  Tha graphics are not even that good.
B00CATSONE|2.0|You would think this is a story about Tesla. It is not, it just uses his name to sell. The book has 3 stories about using immagination, one is connected with Tesla, but that is all you get about him.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Love, love, LOVE this app. Love being able to mix my own sounds and volumes. Really helps for those quick cat naps and even better for a deep restful sleep. Will be putting on my hubby's phone too.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think that this game is awesome and I think everybody should have or play this game. This game is so realistic and it feels like you are really runing away from a black monster. I downloaded this game and I think you would too.
B00CWV8TIU|3.0|I was excited about movie, and admit at times it was interesting and had me intrigued but overall the movie is poor.
B0094M2SCI|3.0|The story was interesting if a bit predictable. The special effects were so-so. Not the best I've seen in the genre but worth spending the time watching as it was free with Prime.
B000FBJF6Y|5.0|IN  a world filled with books and films relying on violence, sex, and cheap methods of evoking suspense,  the  two heroines in &#34;The No. 1 Ladies's Detective Agency&#34;  use their brains, courage, and cunning to solve mysteries.  Set in Botswana, this series is a delightful must read.  I couldn't put it down.
B009NY43NY|3.0|This one was really hit or miss. There was some good pieces but something didn't tie well to the story line. The most disappointing part of the book was the lack of vampires
B006LSZECO|4.0|I know it's twisted to say hilarious but it is. I think most husbands should read this book to appreciate the wife!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|So many relationships and stories and all interwoven so beautifully. And the ever strong message of hope and forgiveness which is ever present in khaled's stories. He has made us wait and the wait has not been in vain!
B00COHAUD4|5.0|This is one of those movies where the monster and the children she's obsessed with steal the show.  She is truly a masterpiece -- elegant, terrifying, relentless, mad and loving at the same time.  If La Llorona could be accurately portrayed, she would look like Mama.
B00B2YH7BS|5.0|This is one of the most entertaining rock & roll history lessons ever produced. Rock fans young and old have to see this film. The story of Sound City is compelling, funny, inspired, and frequently touching. After watching this do yourself a favor... go listen to the music created from the making of this documentary. Good s***!    Hey, Dave Grohl!  MUCH RESPECT!
B009NLC1D6|4.0|Good documentary about a truly amazing person. They did a nice job telling this story in a way that captivates the audience.
B003VIWO8Y|3.0|It is an interesting story, and definitely worth hearing Dave's side of his Metallica days. But like the Anthony Kiedis book, this makes it hard to feel anything but disdain for the subject. The music is fantastic and Dave has a skill in finding other great musicians to fill out his band. I think I will stick to buying the music and not reading about the brilliant, yet solipsistic people that make it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This was the first Hugh Howey series I've read and it won't be the last.  My husband raved for weeks about how great the series was and I finally gave in just so he'd leave me alone.  Lol!  I should have listened sooner!  This was one of best stories I've ever read. It had every element of every great story-suspense, unpredictable twists in the plot, a little romance, lots of hope, and some serious reflection of mankind today. Hugh Howey-you rock!!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|While I anticipated a couple of the major plot twists, it was still a fun, sexy read.  A good summer quickie!
B006LSZECO|4.0|At first it was a little hard to follow, just like any book you have to get used to the writers voice.  I enjoyed how the book was written from two different people giving the characters a love hate relationship with the readers, I felt as I was a report or average American watching as their story unfolded for the world to judge them as each character was loved while the other hated then reversed roles with the turn of the page.
141694737X|5.0|as a therapist I have shared this book as a tool to elicit langauge from toddlers. It is perfect for interaction.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Finally we know the end of the story. Or is it just an end? Well done to all involved. Now to start from the beginning!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This app is amazing. I have it on to relax before bed and it helps me to enter the deep sleep stage easily. I wake up very well rested. I would highly recommend this to people with sleeping<br />disorders.
B007HU4FZ2|5.0|I went to see this movie when it was shown at the cinema. I was in tears then and I was in tears when I watched it last night.<br />If anyone out there is hesitant to buy this definitive edition don't be, it is worth every penny.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Wonderful story lines. Sorry I didn't watch it when it was on tv. Will watch the other seasons for sure.
B005HSL626|4.0|Iti s a very entertaining game. However, every time I finish a game, an add appears on my Kindle. It is annoying.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|I like this show, it's the bom-digity.  Course Leonard is the &#34;Star&#34;, Sheldon makes it .  Just Wish Raj would get someone...
B006VFLIYK|3.0|I liked the book and was quite excited in the first 100 pages.  However, it seemed to turn into an after school special.  I would have preferred something more like Jason Bourne, which I thought was what I was getting.  Some of the mystery was predictable.  The technical details were flimsy.  I might read The Hit and I might not.  This book is just eh-okay.
B009NY43NY|3.0|I won't spoil the book for you, since Harris does that all on her own, but I will say that while the story definitely wraps up with Sookie ending up with who I figured she would, the way that Harris brought the story to summation was disappointing. Character assassination would be the best way to describe it. If you are a fan of the series, I would recommend reading Dead Ever After, just don't go in with high expectations.<br /><br />Several months later: Okay, so it has been a while since I read the book and I can say that I liked it better after I got rid of my idea of how I wanted it to end and just enjoyed the book for what it was--Harris' story. For those who watch True Blood, I think the book series ended way better than the show did if that helps at all.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|\\"Sherlock\\" impressed me. It has a brilliant cast, and amazing dialogue, plot, and photography.  The creators' ideas put unique spins on the show while still remaining in line with Conan's intent.  If you are a real Holmes fan, the frequent (and sometimes humorous) nods will be fun to see.<br />The second season is even better than the first, in terms of writing and filming.  The character of Sherlock is fascinating and well-played; the humor is sly and surprising; the scenery and sets are gorgeous.  Certain parts--especially the scene at Buckingham Palace and the cunning sequence between the Irene Adler's living room and the moor--stand out for their amazing photography, while the rooftop/phone call/season ending was so tense and heart-wrenching it held me spellbound.  I had to watch it twice.<br />As usual, the characters are fun and compelling--I especially enjoy dear Mrs. Hudson and sweet, sweet Molly; while the normal, \\"mundane\\" but enjoyable characters of John and Lestrade nicely balance Sherlock's quirkiness.  The partnership between Sherlock Holmes and Watson was even more evident this season; each of them had to frequently give up something...time, trust, and more...to keep their friendship going.  Both John and Sherlock make each other angry from time to time, but in the end (literally), John remains unshakably loyal and Sherlock turns from his philosophy (\\"Alone protects me\\") to adopt John's (\\"Nope: Friends protect people\\").<br />Every second of this series is utterly enjoyable, and is without a doubt my favorite British show ever.  It is smart and addictive, perfect for fans of mystery thrillers and good drama.  Please, don't miss it!very second is utterly enjoyable.  This is without a doubt my favorite British show ever.  It is smart and addictive, and has more style than \\"MI-5\\" and more intrigue than \\"Downton Abbey\\".  It is perfect for fans of mystery thrillers and good drama.  Everyone should see at least some of it.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|Very enjoyable. Could have skipped the cursing, the book would have been just as good.  Makes me wonder what my dog is thinking.
B00BMEF6IO|5.0|I don't have to say much about each song or anything like that. All I have to say is I started listening to \\"Sleepwalking\\" and \\"Shadow Moses\\" because they had videos on YouTube. After I bought the album, I kept listening to those two songs and then kept easing in on the others. As the other songs grew on me, I was BLOWN AWAY. This is the first album I've heard by these guys and I've seen others say this is nothing like their old work. Some have said they've gone \\"mainstream\\". Where on earth do you hear this music on the radio? You don't. Therefore, they aren't mainstream. They have more production, but the screaming and intensity is still there. This is in all honesty, my favorite album in the past couple years. There just hasn't been a good album that has caught my attention like this one. I'd say buy it ASAP..
B00CB3QTR2|5.0|As the story continues from one catastrophic to another as a final contribute to the simple<br />people going through though times and do prevail as an old culture coming to modern times.<br />This is a very good true story played out with some very talented actors of such a foreign<br />language film of its time.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|Try this for yourself. This app is awesome.I mean come on its an hd camera with recorder..You gotta luv it
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I love this game. I could play it for hours and hours. But why is it guidance suggest. It should be all ages because there's nothing bad in it. Thanks I highly recommend age of zombies too!
B004DM1ZQY|5.0|This is the funniest version of backgammon I have found I really enjoy playing it.  If you are looking for a fun game to play this is it
B00CB3N5DS|5.0|Inspiring as a foreign film could get for it’s time.<br />Captivating story with no English spoken words, and yet with the CC provided in the film<br />You get enough info to know what is going on.
B0052RDHTM|3.0|I'm a big fan of Ken Follett, having enjoyed many of his works over the years. Fall of Giants was a struggle, though, because it spends too much of its considerable length as a drawing room soap opera. I do understand the importance of developing the characters but page after page of droll dialog pushed my patience to the limit. That said, I did enjoy Follett's reconstruction of a western world in upheaval, and there were points at which the book rises to the high standard the author has set over his career. I might venture into the next book in the series, but not now.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|This case is well worth the money as it's very well engineered & protects the Tablet screen from scratch & dirt<br />exposure
B00AHXIC50|4.0|Overall good album and you cam play it all the way through. Bruno Mars is pushing the envelop a little more with regard to vulgarity in Gorilla.  It's not needed to get people to listen to and like your music. A little disappointed in that aspect.
B005OYKI1I|5.0|If your into American classic heroes mussel cars and mussel men clashing with a through-down ending of pulling together as an open venue to a next movie, as we already know<br />Fast Six!<br /><br />No real story or purpose to there defiance but the action and sequence of the actors helps.
B005HEK3JW|5.0|I have most of these on DVD but it is really nice to be able to just stream it on a whim!  I have the 32G memory and I have some of my favourite episides downloaded just so I can watch and enjoy if for some reason I don't have a wi-fi signal! Technology rocks!!
B0043D2LAC|3.0|Would be more worthy if had built with more side pockets and large space inside.<br />Nice gear to keep accessories handy while shooting. I like it.
B005NKGEP2|5.0|This novel had so many twists and turns I almost need to take notes to keep track of what was going on.  A really good read.
B00BQPEIT2|4.0|I love this game. Very entertaining and fun. I hope you this game as much as I love it. Please play this game and buy.
B000FA5STS|4.0|Fascinating concept with a lot of intrigue.  There are a few too many characters to keep track of, thus the 4 rating vs. 5.
B009NY43NY|5.0|A really great ending to my favorite series ever. I love loved getting t know Sookie and will miss her dearly.
B00555X8OA|2.0|I tried several times to read this book, but it reads like a text book and I just couldn't get into it.  I'll try once more, then giving up for good.
B004GYY714|5.0|Being in the middle of nowhere it's great to be able to listen to my favorite talk shows every day

B004DLPXAO|5.0|Yo this thangs the shiz niz dizzle. I go to sleep every night by readin these books on my kindle.
B00AQKEPMI|4.0|Love this movie. Some moments may be scary for the under 5 crowd but overall it presents an entertaining new spin on some of the mythical figures we grew up with.  My son now wants to read the books!
B009FB3XTA|5.0|I absolutely LOVE the Twilight Saga and this just completed my collection of the soundtracks.  My kids even love to listen to the CDs.
B003QS67F0|5.0|This movie not only provides glimpses of the Edison/Tesla rivalry, but it gives several winks at Schrodinger's cat. Must watch film for physicists, I believe.
B00846REIS|5.0|The story quickly grabbed me and the character development was very good.  I found I couldn't put it down after just a couple of chapters.  I hope they keep expanding the stories within.  It could definitely have a lot more life than just a few books.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I can't wait for the next Room!  This was a very enjoyable game.  I hope there will be many more!
B0031Q0XCA|5.0|The inconsistent timeline managed to keep my attention through what initially seemed to be another predictable, quirky, indie love story.  However, the ending has a twist that I think all of us have experienced on the giving or receiving end at some point or another and have just failed to articulate.  I watched this at just the right time  in my own life and can relate to it on so many different levels.  Highly recommend it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|love it its a big help when I need it and with the big screen its easy. the thing of is that its free
B000HL09MG|1.0|This over-rated movie is a waste of good talent.  The presence of Sidney Pollock is perhaps its only redeeming feature.
B00AKFG15S|4.0|It is like meeting old friends again. It takes a little time to remember the intricacies of the past, but then the story takes on a fast pace and is spellbinding as most of JA's books. By itself or as a sequence to the other Clifton chronicles a very worthwhile book! I enjoyed it and I am looking forward to what is coming next.
B004Q3UL2O|4.0|A little bit hokey, but overall it's a fun romantic comedy with a serious edge and truth to it.  To avoid an awkward situation, don't watch on a date with someone who you have not slept with and do not watch with your parents - IMO. Minus the actor who unbelievably plays Jake Gyllenhaal's brother (obnoxious and thrown in for tacky comic relief), the acting is quite good.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|My grandson is getting so much fun out of this silly cat! He loves it so much I will need the change the voice.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I have always liked Mahjong and this one is no exception!<br />Great puzzle to keep you on your toes! You have to pay attention<br />to the symbols.
B000IZ4R1U|5.0|Watching Angelina Jolie run around in tight outfits kicking the hell out of the bad guys is enjoyable.  Regardless of the storyline I really enjoyed this movie and the others with Angelina.  Hope the new series with the new actress does it as well!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Engaging movie about a great story! The pace keeps your attention, even though you know the ending.  Mix of real footage gives realism to the movie.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I love it.  This is a great game that everyone should have.  The price was right.  Cant wait to beat it.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|This game can drive you crazy, but it is fun!<br />You really want to get even with those crazy pigs!
B00402FGEE|2.0|Oh what might have been... an ancient ship, people trapped on board with no way of getting off, millions of light years from home and the ship has a star gate. That should make for interesting drama, but it doesn't add up. Far too little attention is given to interesting situations, and far too much attention is spent on soap opera like relationships between the members of the crew. The character driven plot might have worked a la Battlestar Gallactica or even Farscape, but I never cared one bit for any of these card board cyphers in SU. It took me almost 8 episodes before I even got a couple of their names and that was about all I got. The characters have no emotional resonance with me except for the Jonah Hill like nerd boy and the arrogant scientist played by the Scottish actor who played Bigby in Trainspotting. The nerd boy I found profoundly annoying, the scientist less so, which is not the emotional resonance the writers were going for I'm sure. But then the writers aren't showing me anything about these stock characters, they're telling me. Back stories for some are given, but none are compelling because they feel so contrived.<br /><br />In fact there is nothing compelling about this show at all, not the aliens they encounter, not the plight of the crew and not the ship. The ship itself should be another sort of character, but its not ever fully explored. In fact once its established that its very old and is automatic thats about as far as it goes and the show devolves into one action driven plot after another. To make matters worse there is that annoying trope where some gawdawful \\"serious\\" phony feeling pop song plays at the end of almost every episode and we're treated to a montage. Which is lazy storytelling, especially today when it's overuse has made it into an unwelcome cliche. You can't force people to like characters that don't seem either real or interesting. All the while I felt the scripts were without any original ideas and relied on character development for interest. But relying on character development for interest where there is neither development nor interest is not a good idea. I gave up after about 9 episodes.evelopment for interest. But relying on character development for interest where there is neither development nor interest is not a good idea. I gave up after about 9 episodes.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Great character development, great cast and guest appearances, great relevance from show to show.<br />Totally thrilled by this series and am glad I found it on Amazon Prime.
B000SCHBGQ|5.0|This book is now one of my favorite books. I can't wait to read the next in the series. This book is an amazing fantasy where it remakes history to tell more about it and explain certain things with a twist. It is it is packed with adventure and action.
B004SDSSFY|4.0|My main purpose is to edit custom Excel time sheets that I made for myself on the road. VERY confusing about the &#34;how to's&#34; to get it installed. Youu must have the &#34;freebee&#34; version first and NEVER uninstall it. The only reason why I gave it four [4] stars is I was double billed when the first download/install died. The second attempt worked perfectly. I blame the DataViz people and not Amazon. When I called to get my money back on the first failed attempt, the Amazon rep did not think twice about refunding my money. Somehow she was able to &#34;see&#34; that the first attempt ended in a failed install. Well worth the money.
B0034G4P4O|2.0|Not terribly engaging and would someone please tell me what the point of almost photorealistic 3D animation is? Its not charming and just fake enough to be annoying. The whole thing would have been better actually if it was shot in live action. Craptastic all around.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|It was not painful to watch by any means and a great<br />story, but we did not find it to be an amazing work of<br />art by any means.  Worth your time and enjoyable for<br />sure but not an Oscar worthy film in my book.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I didn't want it to end. Exciting and fun all the way. The book was in that rare group of reads that are so enjoyable that you don't want it to be over. Can't wait for a sequel.
B004MC0FO8|4.0|I have it on my phone with 4.1 Jelly Bean and I love it, but it doesn't work on my tablet with 4.2 JB.
B000AOEMXM|3.0|The unsure crew member who finds inner strength, the overenthusiastic go getter who must learn restraint, the cold Vulcan who learns from those pesky emotional humans, the captain whose intuition and heart are always correct even when they aren't, action for the sake of action, cardboard and (very) unlikeable characters, stock plots and ugh. Why go on? Because it does get better. This show starts as predictable and boring as Star Trek was able to be and the absolute worst of the franchise. Hear that Voyager fans? But it gets better, I promise. Season two improves quite a bit on season one and by season three the writers got the show dialed in, so to speak. To bad season four isn't all that probably due to the show's impending cancellation, but it's still entertaining.<br /><br />As a show Enterprise never really gels , nor does it properly fit into the Star Trek canon or feel. The most obvious example? Enterprise has the the worst theme music for any science fiction show in the known universe, ever. Gene Roddenberry spins at about 2,000,000 rpms every time it plays. But ultimately Enterprise isn't horrible, it's merely OK. Two and a half stars really.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Every show does not disappoint and the guest appearances by amazing actors and actresses makes<br />this show even better.  Always enjoy every show I watch.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|I picked this game up after hearing about it on a podcast. Most games for a phone don't hold my interest beyond learning the mechanics but I found myself picking this one back up repeatedly.  I was almost sad when I finished it.<br /><br />The only downside is that once one finishes, there is little incentive to continue. I may just reset the data and start over.

B00BSBU4EC|4.0|This is an inventive story that touches on the subject of childhood imagination and belief. The artwork and animation is really stunning, especially in HD. Chris Pine's voice was a little flat in places, but everyone else -- Jude Law as the voice talent behind the villain and Alec Baldwin as a Russian St. Nick -- did a masterful job.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|The story is better in the book version I have heard.<br />I was not as moved by this movie as I hoped to be,<br />but the cinematography was amazing to see.

On this I could not think of a greater compliment to give a book, I have already bought Shift and can't wait to read what is going to happen next.<br />  For any of you on the fence about lending this book your valuable reading time, I challenge you to read the first book of this five book omnibus, and then dare you to put it down.<br /><br />Hugh Howey, I thank you for this remarkable experience.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|It provides wonderful insight into the development of Silicon Valley and, more specifically, Apple...while providing a view of the dichotomy of Steve jobs as both a wonderful leader and visionary but a very difficult person to work with and like.  I still don't know if my admiration of his talents overcomes my distaste for his treatment of family, friends and coworkers.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|The ease of streaming and the quality of the stream on my tv or iPad excellent. I would recommend to anyone.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|My first time reading a book before watching the movie.  Great story....can't wait to see the movie and how it is portrayed.
B0089LOKHG|3.0|Lauren Oliver, I like you. I like you a lot. But this book left me with such a wtf at the end that I'm really upset. It felt so abrupt and unfinished. After so much detail and awesomeness, the ending just didn't do it for me. I know I always want more...but this just left me feeling so unfinished.<br /><br />I loved the style of the book. Alternating the two perspectives was brilliant and kept me interested throughout. I think both characters need another chapter or two in order for me to be satisfied.<br /><br />Disappointing ending but incredibly well written and engaging. Gimme more, Lauren! Gimme more.
B00APJLFEG|4.0|Cute movie, feel good movie. very nice voices, it was extremely funny, the character are very human and the graphs are nice.

B0010SEMP0|4.0|Hugely exciting novel, hard to put down. Great story line, with several unexpected twists. I think the second book was better than the first.

B004FV1ESW|4.0|Given Affleck's close association with Matt Damon; it was very hard not to keep comparing this film with Academy Award winning movie THE DEPARTED. The fact that I'm Irish and have a weak spot for films set in Boston makes it even more difficult to say THE DEPARTED was a slightly better film. The love story in THE TOWN is much better, the acting is comparable...maybe that's it. THE TOWN does not have quite the A-List star power that THE DEPARTED did.<br /><br />It can't be that the action sequences are inferior.  THE TOWN's bank robbery scenes make for some taut action drama.  Maybe I should be comparing this film to HEAT, which is a damn fine film and also about bank robberies. These are some elite company for ANY movie to be traveling in. I guess I would rank HEAT at four stars, THE TOWN at four and a half, and THE DEPARTED as five stars.<br /><br />There is a sequence in THE TOWN between Affleck's character and his life long friend; played by Academy Award winning actor Jeremy Renner. Not only does this sequence epitomize these nature of these two characters; and the bond between them; feel it should be nominated to the Halls of Vahalla of great Tough Guy Moments:<br /><br /> [small spoiler]<br /><br />Doug MacRay: I need your help. I can't tell you what it is, you can never ask me about it later, and we're gonna hurt some people.<br />[Jem pauses to think for a moment]<br />James Coughlin: Whose car are we gonna take?<br /><br />I'm sorry, but that pause there when you're wondering what Renner is going to say, what questions he may ask, what objections he might raise and what reservations he could possibly have.... All those character issues are resolved instantly in what I consider one of the greatest I'VE GOT YOUR BACK, BRO'. moments ever set to celluloid. There is REALLY never any question Rennar's character was going to do it and we the audience are lessened for not having already known that. Tough Guy poetry.
0718177525|4.0|Enjoyed this first hand account. Nice to &#34;be there&#34; when history happens. Thankful for the men and women that protect our nation.
B0090SI3ZW|2.0|I'm a sucker for movies like this BUT I should have known better. It seriously sucked.... NO I didn't hate it but I will NEVER get that time in my life back. NO I didn't even finish the movie... My son now has it and HE likes it. SO, not a total loss
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|I been a fan of blake since he started in country music!!!! this is a must for any fan of his if you dont have it get it I promise its worth the money you spend on it

B00BI73CVI|5.0|As an educated and classically trained musician, just let me first say that this is the finest musical (operetta) ever written.  Its themes aren't trashy like &#34;Rent,&#34; etc. or frivolous like other modern ones.  The theme is noble...full of story lines that tug on your heart: romantic and familial love, good vs. evil, redemption through Christ, etc.  The historic backdrop is wonderful and extremely important to the overall message of the story.  Although you can see the roots of Communism in this story, I submit that Communism (as we know it) hijacked what this French movement started as; it didn't begin as a godless political idea that simply replaced monarchy with another form of tyranny.  But I digress.....<br /><br />This film adaptation is superbly done.  Hugh Jackman and Russell Crow do not have that good of singing voices, but they are such tremendous actors that it didn't bother me.  They have such powerful presence on film.  Overall, I was blown away and relieved; the director NAILED it.
B00B89WXYS|5.0|THIS IS ANOTHER CD THAT I LOVE!!!! can't go wrong with it if you're a one republic fan also another must for any fan of this group

1881273377|5.0|The title is dorky, but after going through this class, my whole family opted to dive into this book! I recommend it for anyone, not just relationships. My siblings and I have found it very helpful in understanding each other. It has helped my mom reach out to her kids better. It has helped my dad in his new marriage, since he messed up the first one. It has helped us cater more to our stepsons love language and know what he needs. Everyone can gain something from this book!
B0078X2LKY|5.0|The book was very intriguing it kept my for year old's attention. Although Grover kept saying don't turn the page because he was scared, she showed great courage that the monster at the book was not scary.

B006MW3UZW|5.0|Excellent story lines and scripts. The actors and actresses play their parts in a grand manner. The series gives an insight as to what happened in that era
B008N1V11U|1.0|This game was good, but when I didn't play it for a while, I had to download it all over again
B00CM6ZLG8|5.0|I really hate when people are like \\"I miss the old Demi..\\" There is no old Demi. Demi has grown amd matured. She is nothing like any artist I've ever seen. On each of her albums I've always felt like her words spoke for me. Each word meaning something to me. This album really spoke to me. Especially Her tracks \\"Nightingale\\" and \\"Warrior\\". with everything going on with demi, demi this is definetly a beautiful piece of artwork ... of music. I really believe demi will be legen.. wait for it.... dary!
B008US4PBY|5.0|This is my review of the Cronus device that I used for my Xbox 360 controller on the PS3. Everything I say here can also be done with a PS3 controller on the Xbox 360.<br /><br />It's simple and easy to use. Just plug in and play, no programming required.<br />Though you can go in and reprogram the button layouts on your computer using the USB cable that comes with this device, and even download mods to use if you like. This is useful for people who want to use the triggers(RT and LT) to fire in shooters instead of the bumpers(LB and RB) that the cronus switches to by default. And it is easy to switch between profiles, with a button on the USB device. And there is even an option to allow for remote profile switching, which allows you to push BACK + Xbox guide button, and it switches to the next profile.<br />You can have up to 9 custom profiles, along with the default *0* mode which just switches every button on the Xbox controller to the PS3 controller's equivalent layout(LB - L1, RT - R2, etc.).<br /><br />I feel ZERO lag. I expected to have some lag after using the AWFUL XCM devices, but this is exceptional.<br />You can change the button sensitivity options.<br />You can invert the analog sticks from the device itself(though all games should have this option in their menus by default anyways)<br />And something a lot of people should be aware of, you can even make a profile have sixaxis in the analog sticks. So for games like Killzone or Resistance where you might have to shake or move your controller(since Xbox 360 controller does not have this technology), you only have to quickly switch profiles on the Cronus, move the analog stick whichever way you're supposed to, then switch right back to your preferred profile.<br /><br />Now the way to get this to work on each console is different, and I'll say how.<br />For using the Xbox 360 controller on the PS3, you EITHER need a WIRED controller, OR if you're using a wireless controller, you need a wireless gaming receiver(should be around $20 here on amazon). This is because the Xbox 360 controller is NOT a bluetooth device like the PS3 controller.<br /><br />When using the PS3 controller on the Xbox 360, you NEED a WIRED Xbox 360 controller. You must plug in the Xbox 360 controller into the console first to authenticate it, then once the controller is on, unplug it, then plug in the PS3 controller via the cronus device normally. This has to be done EVERY time you turn on your Xbox 360.<br /><br />I would give this device a 9/10. It's damn near perfect. The only problem I have is I have a backwards compatible PS3 and this just does NOT work for PS2 games. I don't know why, it just doesn't register anything. It works for PS1 games, though.<br /><br />Well, that's all I can think of. It feels just like I'm playing on my 360, I just have to get used to seeing the PS3 controller buttons in the games.
B001NA6096|4.0|I just watched this again. It is timeless! One can just imagine having great conversations similar to this movie.  I can't wait to watch the sequel.
B00881PTRC|3.0|Fun to play.  Love the drawings and watching me hang--LOL the first couple of times.  Still makes me smile when I play the game.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Great app. Did not think i would love it so much. I am even more organized. Have me wondering what the catch is. Lol!
B005GQ5IA0|5.0|A work of art. The slow evolution of a man from desperate human surviving day to day in an apocalyptic world<br />, through to the acceptance of his lack of place in a new world order. Richard Matheson via Robert Neville becomes legend....

B000SCHC0Q|5.0|Good read about an unfamiliar culture but stories that are understood by the heart.  I learned about a different way of life.
0385344228|3.0|The cover speaks to the \\"shocking ending\\" and indeed that is the case here.  I won't give away the spoiler, but Landay clearly takes a page from the masters in suspense by introducing a pivotal character 2/3rds of the way through.  There are some moments that truly make you question Landay's craft however.  The one that had me scratching my head is when the protagonist, Andy Barber, has singled out Leonard Patz, a convicted pedophile, as the lead suspect in the murder.  Yet oddly Barber doesn't even think to see if Patz's fingerprints, which surely are on file, match those of the bloody fingerprints on the victim's sweatshirt.  As a Certified Paralegal that had me profoundly bothered and so much so I almost cast the book aside.  I read on and was gripped by Landay's writing which is truly quite good.  It's only later on I sort of figure out why Barber doesn't go for the obvious but it's surprising that Detective Paul Duffy doesn't mention it at the time.  This whole episode pretty much blew any chance I had of really sitting back and enjoying this read and it pretty much shreds Landay's reputation with me as credible.  Throughout the book everything seems to point to Jacob Barber as being the murder and I have to admit this was a lively topic of conversation at our book club.  The conversation was a bit like being in a jury room with people convinced Jacob did it and a few holdouts convinced there wasn't enough hard evidence beyond a reasonable doubt.  That scarcely matters as you get to the final third of the book which quite honestly is a \\"shocking ending\\" as promised.  And let me tell you there is no shortage of shocking at the ending as it's one shocker after another to the final d&eacute;nouement.  But if I'm brutally honest (and I usually am), \\"Defending Jacob\\" left me feeling hollow.  Yes, it is a scathing indictment of our society...I get that.  In truth it is more satirical, mocking \\"perfect\\" communities and people who are inherently flawed, people deeply into denial about how perfect they and their children are, and yet they are fundamentally flawed, damaged, and broken.  For me that is where Landay resonated more.  We don't know our children, we don't know ourselves, we don't know our partners and companions, and we don't know our community.  That is the more profoundly unsettling message here.  And worse still, I don't get the sense that was Landay's intension.  In many respects the end was surprising and not all that surprising.  The entirety of \\"Defending Jacob\\" wasn't at all satisfying but left me instead a bit shellshocked and embittered as I expected something different.  Granted it was somewhat different and unexpected, yet at the same time a bit rote and by-the-numbers.  \\"Defending Jacob\\" is quite good and a book you will not be able to put down, but it is so fundamentally flawed at times that I'm not sure I'd read another book by Landay.nial about how perfect they and their children are, and yet they are fundamentally flawed, damaged, and broken.

1451695195|5.0|Read this book from a friend. Wanted my own, but at this point it hasn't arrived... A great read for everyone and an inspiration for anyone who believes or doesn't believe in an  afterlife. There surely is one ! This life is preparing us for it!
B008BU75IQ|4.0|Jeffrey Archer creates characters and situations that invite the reader to care about the outcome of the story.  His plots are believable and gripping.
B00498TQV8|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. The acting is terrific and the story is great.
B0043URV5U|5.0|The album title says it all. If you at all like Bob Seger then this album needs to be in your collection. He is down to earth and a great singer/songwriter.
B00B935SUY|1.0|It wouldn't download after dozens of successful downloads from Amazon. I must say that it is a great service...thought not really.

The cinematography is wonderful.  Each region has its own look and color scheme.  The characters are intriguing and each episode leaves you hungering for more...
B0055N0FZM|4.0|Very compelling novel, it was a bit slow to start off with, but very well written, I have been wanting to read this book for ages, and am glad I did.
B0014KFV6I|4.0|Gave a horrible review because of user error. This is a great album, everyone should own it. Really I wrote a scathing review of Amazon downloading, but it was really my fault.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|This series is much darker than the first. I enjoyed it very much. Worth the 20-something dollars for the digital season.
B0040I09RM|5.0|My husband and I both are in love with this series.  I was a little hesitant about watching a biker gang show but I am really into it.  It is a great drama and the characters are well-developed.  I feel like I'm getting an education on the psychology of biker gangs.  The main character is the son and it has been interesting to watch his choices in relationship to his place in the gang, his mom (played by Katey Segal), his step-dad (played by Ron Perlman), his wife, and his biological father.
B008YZ4RR0|5.0|This was a good story that was well portrayed be the cast.  I enjoyed watching it at full length without any commercial interruptions.
147089923X|5.0|One of those books you can't put down!<br />This was such an interesting and different story of WWII. I learned so much of what it was like for the men - on both sides! But I was amazed about what I learned about the German men. It's a book I would recommend to all ages and genders. I'm hoping my young teenage grandson will read it. I would also recommend it to all my female friends too.<br />The author did a fantastic job in the way he told the story, never losing your interest!
B0033AI4PM|5.0|Absolutely nothing to complain about here except for two things:<br />1. The bonus material should have given us the cut songs and scenes, including a complete &#34;Swan Lake&#34;.<br />2. The fact that most of the songs do not have a chapter of their own is a crime.<br />Apart from this, &#34;Funny Girl&#34; has never looked or sounded better.
0345803493|5.0|These books were sent when they were supposed to be.  Brand new. I was happy with my product. Loved the book
B0013YPEMG|5.0|Most movies don't age well, but in my opinion this does. Reason being is mostly because of the cast and director. Even though the special effects are dated. in my opinion Michael Keaton is probably the best Batman. He doesn't have that raspy voice and he's still intimidating. Even though Jack Nicholson has been upstaged by Heath Ledger. He still is a good joker its different from ledgers but yet still the same. I highly recommend to people who enjoy comics and comic book movies.
B008602KQI|4.0|The movie follows fairly close to the book summing up the book in two hours well. Exciting adventure and great casting of characters.
030758836X|5.0|I am a huge fan of The Lion in Winter. This novel reminded me of that film because of the cunning, acting, and deep need to be the significant other's number one that is seen in the novel. Beyond that, however, this novel takes that dynamic and turns it into something so insane that, ultimately, it is fully comprehensible. It is a difficult one to explain, but let me say it was a very, very good read.

B00AS1Q93S|2.0|A typical action film we have all seen dozens of times. The biggest issue for me is casting pretty boy Cruise as Reacher. Cruise would have a tough time whipping Dustin Hoffman let alone the bruisers he comes up against in this film. Obviously Lee Child chose the big pay day versus protecting the imagine of his creation.
B000957O7S|3.0|As far as Will Smith movies go, its one of his best.  However, no will smith movie can ever be 5 star achievable, so 3 stars is all he could get.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I like just about everything from this book. It starts out in District 12, sort of like a state compared to the U.S., in a dystopian country called Panem. Katniss is the main character. When her younger sister, Prim gets chosen to fight to the death in the Hunger Games, Katniss volunteers to take her place. Katniss and another boy from District 12, Peeta Mellark end up winning the Hunger Games, because of a rule change, allowing there to be two winners. They Now have started an uprising, or rebellion, against the &#34;Better than the rest of you&#34; capital city, called the Capitol. They end up defeating the Capitol with help from their fellow districts. The end of the Capitol's dictatorship causes the Hunger Games to cease. The Hunger Games Trilogy was amazing, and I recommend it to everyone who wants action, adventure, and falling-off-your-chair suspense.

B0085YOD1A|5.0|This app does everything I need with no extra fluff and I like the simple, easy to find app icon.
B002MTTZ5I|4.0|This is party metal. The lyrics are cheesy but are actually melodically and lyrically done well. The songs are actually pretty good with excellent musicianship all around. If none of these songs puts a smile on your face then go listen to something else. This is a respectable, cheesy, and melodic nod to the way metal was in the fun days of the 80's before grunge came along and everything got serious. Rock on, Steel Panther, rock on!!
B001I9WK14|5.0|Great fun!  A nice way to get to know this unique rock band and appreciate their outside perspective on America.  Each one is very personable and fully accessible.  The concert footage, which dominates, captures the emotional catharsis of their live shows very well.  For U2 fans, this is a little slice of heaven.  For those unfamiliar with U2, this is a great introduction to what all the fuss is about.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is really fun and entertaining. It keeps me accupied and. my little sisters love it!!! Its good to have in the car so you don't hear are we there yet?
B00B2V66VS|2.0|ok. I got this game because my cousin told me about it and that it was fun to play. so I got it and after I played one game it shut off on me and now I cant play that game anymore on my kindle fire. I immediately took it off. itis a fun game, but if you only want to play it once,then don't even bother to get it. the game was a disappointment to me. I do not recommend getting this.
B005544V6A|5.0|Fun, intelligent & interesting. It took me a while to commit to another series but this one is really good so far.

0263234541|5.0|I don't give out 5 hearts very easily but because it caught me off guard completely, I'm giving it the full 5 hearts it deserves. I got it for FREE from Amazon so I wasn't really expecting it to be this fun, quirky, and seductive. I was dreading it was going to be a bit of a heavy read and somewhat complicated but it turned out to be a predictable (in a good way) and light read, which made it way better than what I was expecting it to be. It was very cheesy and corny, which I usually don't like, but surprisingly I loved reading it on this book. It had that perfect cheesiness and corniness to it.<br /><br />I went through waves of emotions from grinning like a fool to myself, squealing because of excitement, having that \\"uh-oh-this-is-going-to-be-a-disaster\\" feeling, laughing so hard forgetting there were people around me, and crying like a baby.<br /><br />Everything I'm looking for in a guy, I found in Conner.<br /><br />\\"All the vital components that make a relationship successful, without any of the emotional messiness to drag it down. It's about respect, caring and commitment. Shared goals and compatible priorities. It's about treating a marriage like a partnership instead of some romantic fantasy. It's about two people liking each other.\\"<br /><br />While reading the first few chapters of the book, I was think that sooner or later my \\"perfect man\\" fantasy of Conner will be crushed, but it wasn't.<br /><br />Conner didn't release her fingers, but tightened his hold, reeling her back in. \\"Because you're mildly pessimistic. Now, knock it off. You don't remember, but if there's one thing we do well...it's talk. About anything.\\"<br /><br />\\"I've got you,\\" His voice was a low rumble against her ear, the contact between them almost a kiss before he stepped back and handed her the dress. \\"What I want is to keep you.\\"<br /><br />I loved Megan's character, too, and I could relate to why she hesitated a lot in trusting Conner and opening up to him. She has her reasons and she's used to being alone and independent.<br /><br />I liked another character that most probably won't even notice as much, Jeff. Oh, Jeff was funny! If I'm going to be married to someone someday, I'd love for him to have a friend like Jeff.<br /><br />\\"You'd been gone about thirty seconds when the `gymnast' shows up at the table, with this whopper of a line.\\"<br />\\"The gymnast? Dude!\\"<br /><br />\\"But I have to admit that gelatinous puddle - which even Megan didn't eat, by the way - was without question the worst thing I've ever shoveled into my mouth.\\"<br />\\"Dude.\\"<br /><br />People would find this book is cheesy, corny, predictable, too good too be true, or whatever else, but I just don't care. There are times when a girl needs to be reminded that it's okay to dream and have fantasies, no matter how far-fetched they are. This is probably the mother of all cheesy and corny lines ever, but whatever.<br /><br />\\"You don't remember my first proposal, but I'm hoping this one will stick. Megan, I love you. And I'm asking you to let me give you a lifetime of what you've shown me matters most. Laughter, love, late-night conversations. I'm asking you to be my wife in the most conventional, traditional and time-tested meaning of the word, for as long as we both shall live.\\"<br /><br />Ahhhhh... melt! If you need a light, fun, quirky, and romantic read, I recommend you this book.<br /><br />For more reviews like this, please visit http://booksandbindings.com/she's used to being alone and independent.<br /><br />I liked another character that most probably won't even notice as much, Jeff.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love how you can care for the animal and make it feel real!!!!!!!!!!!! I also love being around horses so I really think that you should download the best animal game  in the world.5stars total I wish I could give the app 17or even 100 stars.<br /><br />Free download
B009NY43NY|1.0|Some of CH's earlier books were really great, but this was the worst book I've read in a long time - grammar etc. was ok, but the plot was non-existent. Unlike most readers I'm not a Sam vs Eric person. So I'm evaluating this based on readability and quality of writing.<br /><br />I expected some huge battle (given the Devil being involved and it being the climax of the series) but it was just about Sookie running for her life. What happened to the strong, heroine we have come to love?<br /><br />This series should have ended a long time ago. The plot was weak, the characters were out of character and the author flipped POV 1st to 3rd and back, generally a no-no and not typical of CH's previous books .<br /><br />My guess is that this was written by a ghostwriter - and a not very talented one at that.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|My kids really enjoy the game but loved the movie.<br /><br />If you enjoyed the movie you will fined that the game keeps you entertained.
B004TI5N38|4.0|Filled with suspense  very interesting. Couldn't put it down and it a was a surprise ending. Would definitely recommend to those who love a great mystery!
B009NY43NY|5.0|This is a long story from the mind of a great writer. Never perfect but always beautiful. Just because we would end it differently doesn't mean it's not right. I'm a happy camper and I enjoyed all the books in there own way.
B004W1GCQO|5.0|Anything BBC does is wonderful. Great acting, beautiful sets and good story lines. Try it you will like it. Great!
B0031RS2HC|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book and am going to work my way through the whole series in chronological order bebcause i dont want to miss a word
B000I3W1XS|5.0|This video is awesome.  I just wish it was free on amazon prime like the rest of the series.  If you're not a trekkie, you might not like it.
0446310786|5.0|I had to purchase this book for my school research final, I thank Amazon for the price I purchased for and thank you for being there for me no matter what, you always seem to have what I am looking for.<br /><br />Princess<br />California
B0028IDXDS|3.0|I think there a little expensive now, seeing how wal-mart jas the same thing for only $6. But there not wabanub. And for a 3 month old, they really dont like them as much as i thought. But as the baby gets older the baby will like it more.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|This book is the truest depiction of a sociopath that i have ever come across in fiction. Be prepared to read throughout the night
B00AAX68HG|5.0|This app is so fun! It has nice graphics &amp; the pudding monsters are so cute. This game is so addicting! Definetly one you should get, its suitable for all ages.
B0055S348W|1.0|Premium version working fine for months, now I get error whenever I try to print after this last update. Nowhere is there a link to get in touch with the creators.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Mr. Hosseini doesn't just tell you a story. He walks down the path with you, pointing out all the little bits and pieces he wants you to see, and then asks, \\"what do you think?\\"<br /><br />Really listen to and think about the details, the tapestry the author has woven. How messy we humans are, with ourselves, with each other.<br /><br />Character development and depth of story are spot on. You won't want to put it down until you finish it.
B00CM96A60|5.0|I like the entire album. The refrain was the best track out of all of them. This is a top notch artist that I would recommend to anyone who likes electric/dance music.
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|This series continues to entertain and draw you ever deeper into the lives and stories of the characters you by now have grown to love. I can't wait for the continuing story and neither will you. Start the series you won't be disappointed.
B004AJSUTK|4.0|Though unfairly criticized for the \\"disco\\" hit \\"Da Ya Think I'm Sexy\\", this is essentially a VERY GOOD rock album. Unfortunately the price an artist must pay for their success is to be accused of \\"selling out\\". Then again, even rock (or disco) artists need to eat, so if a polka song is what sells, then damn the critics: Full 2/4 beat ahead! When this album came out, they played the song to death on all radio stations and the inevitable backlash didn't take long. On this record, Rod keeps most of his band from the previous 2 albums, but most of these would be given their walking papers right after this one. I recently was able to buy a still sealed copy of this LP. I enjoyed it very much. The remastered CD is also excellent. Save for two or three disposable tracks, this is good bang for the buck.
B008C20TDG|5.0|I grew up watching my mom try every diet under the sun and vowed to never do the same. But I have to admit, I got pulled in by several in my adult life. They always seem so convincing - that they are The One that will work - but they never are.<br />It Starts With Food is the one that doesn't claim to be a diet, doesn't claim to be the right way for everyone. I've stopped calling how I eat a \\"diet\\", and have begun recognizing my food as my nutrition, my fuel for performance, my medicine.<br />This book does a wonderful job of explaining how your body uses food and how food affects your body. Understanding how the machine works, and how different fuels affect it, help the user to make better choices to achieve the desired outcome.
B008602KQI|4.0|The movie demonstrates the dangers in a world of haves and have-nots. Although the outcome is some what predictable, it's a feel good ending for everyone wanting good to conquer evil. The acting of key characters is excellent.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|Very good game to keep busy with.  It is such a rip off of Mario brothers though.  Worth downloading and trying out the game.
B009NY43NY|3.0|Although several of her last few books have less than stellar, I was looking forward to seeing how Ms. Harris would end her Sookie Stackhouse series, most of which I had enjoyed.  I'm sad to say that the ending fell rather flat and left me feeling a tad cranky.  Well, goodbye Sookie, it was nice knowing you.
B000RO0ONW|5.0|I got this for my son and he loves it.  We took a chance and bought the British version because it looked like the same thing and was a lot more cost-effective.  Rest assured that it is completely compatible with our PS3.  The games will keep you busy and challenged for a long time.
B001OSIV62|5.0|Must see, they should make a real movie about this guy, its just unbelieveble and inspiring about how to persue your dreams.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a very good book you could see everything happen like it is coming to life I would give this book mare stares if I vould
B0074VA2T2|5.0|My boys love this app. It teaches them counting using a family favorite the hungry caterpillar.  I like it because it's educational and had different levels so my 4 year old and my 6 year old enjoy it.
B005LN5UOC|5.0|This is the first time I have purchased any kind of blue tooth headset.  It works great with the PS3 right out of the box after an initial charge-up.  My nine year old son uses this primarily for his interactive games (with supervision, of course) and he says that he can hear and communicate well with it and that it is comfortable to wear.  I would recommend it.  Very cost-effective too especially for an initial headset for kids.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is GREAT acting, no violence, no cuss words, no blowing up everything in sight -- just a great story unfolding with great actors. A wonderful change from regular TV programming.  Awesome!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This game has beautiful art, however, it does not take away from the game itself.  The game has three challenge levels.  The further you go in the game the harder it gets, you have to complete your tasks and collect all of the pieces of the artifacts or you lose a life. This game is great when you are trying to relax or you need a diversion to boredom.  I especially love the music and the art. In the game it also has a good story line, (if you want to read it, if not just skip).  But I recommend reading the story line, it just adds to the game.<br /><br />I highly recommend this game, it does help when I have a headache, thank you amazon.com, you have provided me with great pleasure with this game.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|i love this game.  be prepared to become addicted.  its way too much fun to put down.  i hope their making Room 2!!!  if not...get on it people!!!
B00CL68NOG|5.0|Not what I expected. Really didn't want to watch someone putting guilt on a kid but I love Barbra Streisand so I went for it. So glad I did. It was gentle Motherly overbearing with a lot of love and good humor. And Barbra? What can I say? She was wonderful.
B00BS4PF0C|5.0|Definately new aged Blake. If you dont like some of the songs on his last album you wont like this I'm open the country music genre has opened up and so has he.
B00632HWOG|5.0|So much easier to get my email on my Kindle Fire than before when I had to go to the web and type in my password which I always mistyped. This app puts a little notification if new mail comes and I can click and delete and read so easily. I do save my replies for when I use the computer because I don't type well on the Kindle, but that is just me. It is easy to reply and forward. A great app.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|Loads of fun, can't wait for the next one! Right from the beginning you get pulled in and its hard to put down.
B004TI5N38|4.0|I have been a fan of Baldacci for a long time. I have really enjoyed his other series and look forward to reading the other installments with John Puller, a new hero to route for.
B003NX75B8|5.0|Deep, thoughtful, and funny.<br />The writing styles are wonderful and  this charming little book says so many things. Well worth the read.
B001NKI60W|2.0|I have seen Mamma Mia on stage and I loved it. I am also a fan of ABBA from the old days when they were popular. I own the original vinyl and some CDs too. Adding that Pierce Brosin is good looking and Meryl Streep is an amazing actress, I expected to love this one. But Pierce is not a singer, and Meryl is NOT a good singer and in my favorite part where the mother of the bride sings &#34;Winner Takes it All,&#34; she not only sang poorly but the acting consisted of her flailing her arms around and it was so sad - not in the way the writer/composer had intended, but in a &#34;gosh, this is pitiful&#34; way. I will watch it again to make sure, and because I really want to like it. But I am pretty sure it is horrid.
6302212529|5.0|I love Disney movies.  And I always watched them from the time they first started to the present.  I bought this for a friend who had had this movie on vhs and couldn't watch it any more.  Now she and I can see it clearly and enjoy it to the fullest.  Great movie.  Highly recommend any Disney or Pixar Movie.  New or old.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Great game lots of challenges.  Good story line. Need more chapters or bonus games. Looking forward to the sequel.  I recommend this game.
B00503BN1M|4.0|No Strings Attached was good and super funny.  I expected the outcome.<br />I was not to crazy about some of the plot.  Yet it drew me in to return and veiw the rest.<br />I reccomend this movie.
B008IYR2BA|5.0|We are big Dexter fans and after purchasing Season 5 we just had to move on to Season 6 right away. It is a great one. Any fan of the show will be glad to own this.
B00196YNWU|5.0|My son was in this play and we saw this movie so he could get into his character. We were singing the song for days. Nice movie to see with children.
0553106635|5.0|The game of thrones books are great! The character developement seems to never end and I cant wait to turn each page...
B00C061I3K|2.0|A whopping eight years after releasing Human After All, Daft Punk have returned with their fourth studio album, Random Access Memories. Instead of beating around the bush I'm just going to come out and say it, I was really disappointed with this album. After such a long break I expected them to come out in full force, but Random Access Memories never seems to find its groove. After hearing \\"Get Lucky\\" for the first time I tried coming in with low expectations because I wasn't fond of the single, but I still wound up leaving let down.<br /><br />A big change this time around is their approach to songwriting. Instead of focusing on the instrumentation and looping a phrase, or set of phrases, throughout each song, they tried actually writing songs with verses and a chorus. Actually, it's more like bridges and a chorus that get repeated throughout the song. While I can respect their attempt to branch out a little bit, the end result just doesn't work. This is because majority of the lyrics are lazy, generic, and lacking in creativity.<br /><br />Then there's the inclusion of guest vocalists. I might be mistaken, but I'm almost positive that this is the first instance of Daft Punk using any sort of guest vocalists. Once again, I respect their desire to branch out and try new things with their music, but the inclusion of guests vocalists does nothing positive if their lyrics are just as lazy as the lyrics from Thomas & Guy-Manuel. Also, considering that this is a new element to their music, it was a bit daring to include vocalists on half of the songs. Truthfully, when I listen to Daft Punk I want to hear Daft Punk. Not Pharrell, Paul Williams, Panda Bear, or whoever else they can get on a song. This isn't a Gorillaz album.<br /><br />All that aside, though, the music in general is just boring. From someone who listens to a lot of down-tempo/ambient electronic music I found myself bored while listening to majority of this album. Now that's not the case for every song, butmost of the songs on here feel like they're forcing you to try and feel something. A good emotional song is not good because it's made with the intention of making the listener sad or reminiscent, it's good because it's from the heart. Instead of letting the music do that naturally they tried to force this and it just doesn't work. With that said, \\"Motherboard\\" is a fantastic example of how you make a good, ambiance-filled song. I think this is the emotional drive they were trying to go for on a good chunk of the album, but this song was the only instance where it actually seemed to work out.<br /><br />Then there's the inclusion of the 70's/80's-esque music that appears mainly in the middle of the album. This is what was throwing me off when I heard \\"Get Lucky\\" for the first time. Generic sex-lyrics aside, I'm just not into that era of music. I'm into that era of Hip Hop, but the pop scene during that time just isn't appealing to someone like me. However, as I've said twice already, I can respect their attempt at branching out and experimenting with their sound. It may not have worked for me, but they did do a good job of capturing the sound from that time and in the end that's what they were trying to accomplish.<br /><br />For me, one of the strongest songs on here is track three, \\"Giorgio by Moroder\\". My only complaint with this song is Giorgio Moroder talking on and off throughout these nine minutes (this is the longest song on the album). It was nice the first couple of times, but it got old fast. However, when you ignore that and you just listen to the composition it's almost mind blowing. To me it's kind of reminiscent of a classical symphony. It starts off pretty slow and everything leads up to this big climax/finale before it slowly dies down again. It's just a really impressive song and I would have liked to hear more like it on the album.<br /><br />Standout Songs: \\"Giorgio by Moroder\\", \\"Motherboard\\", & \\"Contact\\"<br /><br />Overall Score: 4/10 - RandomAccess Memories proves that it is an acquired taste. This album definitely isn't for everyone and that's ok. As I previously mentioned I respect them for stepping out of the box and trying something new, but it just didn't click with me. Maybe I'll keep this on my iPod for a little longer to see if it'll grow on me a little bit, but after eight listens my opinion has yet to change. There's no doubt in my mind that some die-hard fans will enjoy this album (either blindly or genuinely) and good for them. For everyone else, if you're unsure of how you feel after the first single then I would recommend listening to it online before making the purchase. As I said, it's more of an acquired taste that won't be enjoyed by everyone.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Fascinating history.  Gripping story line.  Engaging characters.  Excellent acting.  Blistering pace.  Can't stop watching.  Just what a series should be.
B000N2HBSO|3.0|Haven't finished yet.  Great on Kindle.<br /><br />I will finish this book in 2-3 more week.  I will give a better review then.
030758836X|4.0|I read this one for my book club - a fast read, even for one who usually prefers cozy mysteries.  Passed it on to granddaughter, who likes it even more.  I think it will travel well.
1452115567|5.0|The concept of why this was inspired is inspiring itself!  You can tell these are not photo shopped although you will want to convince yourself they are but they are not!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Love all the levels. Great Challange!  Love that you can skip some impossible levels and move on, then go back and try again
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|Item is exactly what it claims to be: economic gaming mouse.  Performs well, looks cool.  A few weird things though- when I power off my PC sometimes the mouse LED stays on until I click a mouse button.  Also, it appears some sort of glue or bonding agent is leaking from the rubber thumb pad on the side.  Overall, minor issues and easy to overlook.  I would absolutely recommend this mouse to a gamer who doesn't want to spend a lot.
B001QL5MAA|4.0|A proper hard Science fiction although with some sketchy concepts. Alistar Reynolds knows his science and makes up an intriguing plot. Great for Star Wars and Star Trek haters.
B00ANDDBBE|5.0|david tennant's final full season. i thought they crammed a bit too much into the final episodes and if you don't watch the spin-off series you may be a little lost. all in all though, this is wonderful stuff
B00BC24NT4|5.0|A realistic, get in the process novel. The descriptions of the primary characters allowed me to get in their skin, importantly into their brain. Loved it.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  I thought the characters were well developed and the store tied together.  Would recommend this to my friends.
B00CE6E6B2|5.0|Great game!!!!!  I lke the many different things to but and the games within the game.  The times to are to long.
0765325950|5.0|An excellent ending to one of the greatest fantasy series of all time.  Sanderson deserves much appreciation for helping to bring this series to its satisfying conclusion.
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|This had a great cast of actors, great visuals and design.  The story, however, was extremely complicated, disorientating, and the dialogue was a challenge.<br /><br />I guess you would need to watch multiple times to understand, but you would be lucky to make it through the first time.
B006T3RM08|2.0|As others have previously reported, the fit is too tight for the track pad click function.  The retainer clip seems to push the bottom portion of the track pad too tightly into its compartment to allow a click.  A work around is possible if you don't snap the top of the pad into the locked position.  It is not secure, but you can manage clicks.  I have several other fixes that might work, but Dremel mods will make a return impossible.  I want to make it work because it is a perfect design for my situation.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Awesome. I am level 5 and so far I haven't needed to buy anything with real money. The graphics are very good and works well on a kindle fire.
B009NY43NY|3.0|I have loved this series by Charlaine Harris and this book was not one of her best.  The storyline was muddled at best and did not make a whole lot of sense.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|This series is excellent. It leaves you wanting more and more. This is the reason why I like Amazon.com. You don't have to wait until next week, you can watch episode after episode. Very interesting I just love it.
B002KREVCO|5.0|AC/DC was one of the first bands that I got into in my teen years back in the 80's (I'm aging myself) & I had pretty much all of their albums they made in the 80's. Then, as being a Christian, I thought it was &#34;Devil Music&#34; & burned ALL my secular stuff in our fireplace at the time, probably at a price tag of over $500.00!! Boy, was I wrong! Sure, they sing about the devil & stuff but who can take them serious with their sometimes humorous lyrics & antics, they're just having fun & want us toas well . I'm still a Christian but love all kinds of secular music & slowly building my collection back up & this gem just added to my collection. Great sounding cd's which bring out the vocals moreso than the original releases! The one ballad/love song just cracked me up as you don't EVER hear that song played in the USA!! Thank God they only wrote & sang one because it's certainly not their cup of tea. I haven't listened to all of it yet (I just got it yesterday) & I've only watched about 2 minutes of the dvd as I only put it in the player to make sure the dvd played on America made players, & it did. I love what I've seen & heard so far & I'm sure I'll still feel the same way after I hear & watch it all as ac/dc is a true picture of what Rock was & is meant to be! My favorite bands are DISTURBED, DEVICE, AVENGED SEVENFOLD, & you can now add AC/DC back in the top 5 (I need 1 more now)!!
B00CSWA1PM|5.0|Great soundtrack to one of today's hit Broadway musicals! Cyndi Lauper has made a comeback through her music and lyrics for Kinky Boots! They are fun, modern songs that make you smile and want to get up and dance. Go see the show for great performances. If you can't, live it through this soundtrack!
B004ADH1RI|5.0|This is the best movie of all time. If you don't own it your life probably doesn't have any meaning.
B008JFUO0Y|2.0|I should have known something was wrong the moment I walked into the theater, and only 5 other people were sitting around.  By the end of the film, we all looked equally pissed off.<br /><br />Ok, splatter-fanatics, you'll definitely get a few gory scenes, BUT...<br /><br />at least Bruce Campbell played a character that you actually gave a crap about, whereas I could give a flying f*** about whatever happened to these dull and lifeless actors.<br /><br />The barest skeleton of the original premise was still in place, but the story had been turned on it's head, and not even the original names of the characters made it into the script.  No Ash, no Cheryl, no over-the-top low-budget creature effects, just some cheap red and yellow contact lenses, some clown-white make-up, and some black goo that looked like motor oil in place of blood.<br /><br />The only moments of horror cinema glory that this film had to offer were some rather creative practical make-up effects and a few scenes containing gratuitous gore.  Other than that, this was such a disgrace to the Evil Dead franchise that I find it baffling that Sam Raimi allowed his name to be used in the credits as a producer.<br /><br />You practically see everything exciting about the film in the red band trailer, with maybe a couple of things held back.<br /><br />This supposed \\"reboot\\" was a travesty.  You're better off waiting for it to play for no extra charge on Netflix or Amazon Prime.  It's total crap.<br /><br />Even the somewhat interesting Sumerian lore of the original \\"Book of the Dead\\" has been replaced by idiotic warnings in English, and cheaply done scrawling of Satanic symbols that you'd probably find in some 8th grade school binder that some Death Metal fan would draw.  Goat heads and pentagrams.... Ooooo.  Scary.<br /><br />ALERT!!! MAJOR SPOILER ALERT!!! ALERT!!!<br /><br />Remember in the original Evil Dead when Ash had to take his girlfriend out with a chainsaw?  Yeah... well... the new character thattakes Ash's place is the one that bites the dust, and in place of the girlfriend, the sister, now named Mia, is the heroine at the end, after miraculously rising from the earth with her hair in place, her dress, which suddenly comes from we-don't know where, is spotless, and all traces of demonic possession have been erased.  Even her split tongue, the one you see being cut in two in the red band trailer, is healed back to normal.<br /><br />Does this sound like the original Evil Dead some of you die-hard Raimi fans came to love?<br /><br />Stay far, far away from this dung heap.  If you decide to buy it, don't say you weren't warned.
1591396190|5.0|Just what I requested.  This was recommended to me by my company's CEO.  It is not a new book, but some of the ideas are just as fresh and relevant as when they were first written.
B00B7Y0206|4.0|There were several apps for You Tube but this seemed the best for my Kindle Fire.  Important to choose right app for platform!
B009NY43NY|4.0|I didn't think this book was bad or surprising.  It was just more mindless Sookie fun that I had come to expect from the series.  I was scared to read it after the bad reviews, but I am glad I did.  It was a decent ending to the series.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I don't know what else to write that hasn't been written. I enjoyed every moment of Downton Abbey. Can't believe I didn't know of it sooner. I went on to buy Season 3 (I'm a prime member so I got to enjoy the first two seasons free). I'll wait until after Season 4 to watch it without commercials.
B00CUWWLWG|3.0|Its okay, nothing great. Grandkids were bored with the game. I expected more adventure. Didn't hold our interest very long.
B000JJCQ68|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all-time.  Excellent cast and performances, on a topic that needs to be watched. A must see for all those studying the Holocaust.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I very much enjoyed this book.  The only time I put it down from start to finish was to sleep!  A good vacation choice.
B007SGM084|5.0|Being a fully heterosexual man secure in my mind I really enjoyed reading these books gave me a good mindset for what women were thinking and liking about these books. It was very well written and being a man I'm proud to say I read  these books and always recommended them to everyone I speak to about them!
B005ZCXPP0|4.0|Really liked it. Based on the comic. The ending was built for the 2nd movie. Overall a really good/solid mivie. Not for young children.
B004SEUJ82|5.0|My class loved this movie!  Two students borrowed it to show their parents.  Positive feedback was given by the parents on the movie and its message.
B0094K20FK|4.0|Fun story, Ricardo Montalban is a great Kahn.  For a 30-year-old movie it didn't look to dated.  I guess the the advantage of shooting a movie set in space and in the future.
B009NY43NY|2.0|Is this the same author who wrote the amazing 1-9 books? After 9, they went to pieces. It's such a shame, for all the huge fans out there, myself included. I don't know why I wasted my time and money on the rest.
0140557741|5.0|Excellent!  Five stars for the quality of the paper and printing, and also for content.  This book is well worth the money spent.
B00AHQNHSY|5.0|I have been looking for a player that can play just about anything I throw at it...I say 'just about' due to the fact that I haven't tried all formats just yet.  The brightness adjust is a very good addition not to mention the jump feature and fine volume control.  This has to be one of the very best as far as my kindle fire goes.  Thank you for this wonderful player.
B008BU75IQ|4.0|He continues to write very enjoyable stories with interesting character development, although he sometimes takes the characters too far. Very enjoyable reading.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The Piano Guys have a contagious love of music and a sense of fun and whimsy that makes their music, and especially their videos, such a delight to watch!<br /><br />I wish every school in America would show The Piano Guys; I think they'd inspire a lot of kids to learn classical instruments and pieces of music. Their ability to combine classical music with popular makes Beethoven and Bach exciting and relevant.<br /><br />There is a version of this CD that includes a DVD. I strongly recommend it, as their videos add a lot of humor. The Cello Wars, in particular, benefits from their playful approach to music. If you don't have the DVD version, seek them out on Youtube.<br /><br />These guys are awesome!
B004HD61KE|4.0|Great book!<br />Rollins continues to be a master story teller mixing fiction and reality.  This series gets better with each book.
B00CS7ZIHI|3.0|I have followed this band for many years and their evolution has been astonishing. But I think they must have peaked with their last album because this one is a downer. I kept waiting for the heart grabbing, soul ripping you experience when listening the last album but it just never came. At the end of this album I was left with an emptiness that was very disheartening.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is very  challenging and entertaining for my son and I; it keeps him quiet during meetings and long travels.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|In the limited amount of time I've been using it, it seems to be a very capable app, however I wasn't able to give five stars because it isn't very user intuitive.  I find it rather difficult to decipher by way of the icons, just eh gay it will or can do.  The sync function however is is very good and has flawlessly synced my info across a kindle fire HD, a Motorola photon and my laptop.
B000IZ8SD8|5.0|Growing up watching sci-fi (a lot) meant that I was exposed to the good, the bad, and the really bad. This movie was my favorite sci-fi movie of all time due to the intense nature of the Borg. While the movie isn't \\"perfect,\\" per se, if you want someone who isn't a \\"trekkie\\" to enjoy a Star Trek movie, this might be the one. Creepy and fast-paced, this will hold your attention to the end. The makeup of the Borg is outstanding, to say the least, and can be downright frightening to a child, and almost guaranteed nightmare-inducing to anyone younger than 13.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone wanting a good action or sci-fi flick. I think it has about the right mixture of action and nerdiness. Love it.
B005HED11Y|5.0|1960 were a wonderful time to be a kid and this show brings you right back to that time.  Well worth rewatching this one
1416914285|5.0|I would recommend is book to anyone looking for an action adventure book. The storyline is amazing with awesome twists and descriptions that paints a vivid picture.this book is amazing I wish I'd known though if her mum had woken up or not at the end of the story but it didn't say anything about oh well.
B009NY43NY|1.0|Was so looking forward to this book. Could not wait to see what happened with Eric and Sookie. Eric who I love!!! Once I started reading and saw the direction the book was going I couldn't finish the book. It's not worth my time. If I could get a refund back on this I would.  So very disappointing!!!  I think Charlaine Harris needs to rewrite this book over!!!!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I'm a dedicated amazon user.  I use amazon for everything.  And I own 2 kindles.  I have never made an amazon review.  And this book has compelled me to do so.  When I read a book, I tend to avoid the majority of reviews (which I live by for non-book items) because they often contain spoilers and I love for a book to surprise me.  Because of the crazy good reviews on this I decided to buy it.  I just spent the entire day reading it - a new record for me (the longest book I've read in one day was about 350 pages).  I'm an avid reader and I can tell you that there's only been about 3 books in my life that I couldn't stop reading - and this is number 3.  What an amazing good book.  It was an emotional roller coaster and about 1/4 of the way through I decided I needed to clear my schedule for the rest of the day.  I laughed, I cried, I experienced heartbreak and emotional sickness.  I can't and won't say anymore, I will just say you won't regret this one.  Amazing.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Best thing about it is how much lighter it makes my purse. Having my library at my fingertips when the opportunity to read presents itself during the day is awesome. Right now I'm troubled because I put the app on my phone last year and now I've dragged out my old iPad and want to download it here and when I try I'm told I already own it. There must be a way, I just don't what it is.
B002RI9TB4|5.0|\\"Half of a Yellow Sun\\" is one of the best books I have ever read! It shows historical events through personal stories. The story is written so well that I had difficulties to pause and I read the book during one weekend.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|I am a big fan of Nathan Fillion on Castle so its great to see him in this show where he is a lot younger
B00A2H9LK6|1.0|I turned this off after about 24 minutes, and I've sat through a lot of bad movies.  Even Sean Bean couldn't save this train wreck.
B00BEZTMQ8|4.0|Missed it in the theaters, so jumped on this as soon as it was released.  As usual, the movie failed to exceed my imagination while reading the book.
B00594XOZU|5.0|Get it NOW!!! So easy to use and doesn't crash! It's fast and reliable! I LOVE kik, you MUST get it, if u don't have messages get this. SOO MUCH better than other cheapo text apps! Awesome, AND free!!! Works on most any device! I'm typing on my kindle fire right now! I also have and iPod touch and works too! And also with iPhones! Get it!!!
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|The book was bad. I got bored about halfway through it and was annoyed at how unbelievable the plot and characters were. Everyone had stupid names, minor characters were severely underdeveloped and pointless, dialogue was ridiculous, and it was just bad. I stopped reading right after Sky's father blew his brains out, figured it was a good time to bow out and save myself from the pointlessness that was sure to follow. How did this book get so many good reviews? I just don't get it.
B006G3JQ78|5.0|My kids loved this movie and it was nice traveling back into my childhood with them while watching this movie.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I loved all of the chemistry and science stuff.  It was a great story and kept me interested throughout. Highly recomended.
B00C7DGRL4|5.0|This movie is so awesome. Man I can see this movie over and over again, hope to see a second movie soon. Its amazing how a children's fairy tale can become such an amazing motion pic 5 stars all the way no doubt.
B005CGI4EG|4.0|I bought this set because I wanted to revisit the show, and seeing as how the entire series was available for forty bucks, it seemed insane not to just buy the whole set. It's true that all of the dvds are on two big spindles, but who cares about packaging when you just want to see the show? If you wanted to, you could just put the dvds in your own sleeves.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the labeling on the first few seasons is very vague and confusing. They don't specify the order of the disc, so you kind of have to guess which is the next one. Also, the original theme song is not in seasons 3 through the end, but again, I just want to watch the shows, I don't care about the obnoxious theme song anyway! Definitely worth the purchase!
B000U0O9FM|4.0|One of my colleagues read and was encouraging the office to read. Sinde this isone of my favorite movies decided to give it try.<br /><br />Definitely will read this author again.
B009NY43NY|1.0|The last 2 books were &#34;meh&#34;, so I was expecting this one to not be any better and I was correct! The series started out so strong to end like this was is HUGE disappointment. I would have not bought the book but once I start a series, I have to finish it (unless the first book is really bad). I gave it a shot and you can tell that she was all out of ideas/inspiration and was just wanting to end the series.
B00594XOZU|1.0|The first couple of weeks it was working fine then it broke. When I turn this app on my screen goes blank and my device say kik is not responding. Kik does not support me or my device.
B00846REIS|5.0|Could not put this book down! I've recommended to everyone! It's like fifty shades but with a twist! A must read
0689835604|1.0|Every page was bad! If your going to get these book buy it new, other wise its a big wast!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love the convenience of having my bible with me at all times.  It is wonderful having different translations available at<br />Your finger tips. I only use the King James and NOV versions, but it is nice being able to have both versions together.<br />I also love having the book mark feature and being able to take notes. It comes in handy when you find a scripture that<br />You want to remember ... I highly recommend this to everyone.
B00BFUUMO8|2.0|This is a really good game but it takes forever to load. Plus it glitches. Once i got to the game and my dinasors wer gone!?!  And when i lost my Wi-Fi connection it wouldnt load at all!?!?! If you want it,fine bot youre takin a risk.

B00B04NJLW|1.0|A-awful<br />B-bad<br />C-crap<br />worst anthology ive seen too short and not good. just 1 good short and its claymation. go for anthologies but stick to creepshow, vhs, trick r treat. dont waste your good money on this manure.
B005LAIGW8|5.0|Good movie not the umf of the original however there are good moments and great action Nick is the actor for the job he needs more freedom for his creativity when playing the part. I would recommend this movies to others
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This show had me hooked from the very first episode. Each character is well written and engaging. If you like period drama, this one is wonderful.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Puzzle game for those who like dark supernatural mysteries with a twist. A broken heart searching to bring his lost love back, tricked into kidnapping a mother from her child. As the lead detective you must find and save them all.
B005J4TLQG|4.0|if you enjoyed Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz this is a must have for your collection hands down!
B007URVZJ6|5.0|A must read if you plan to publish an ebook on Kindle. It has great tips and advice on how to write, format and set up your book for publication through KDP. Read this before you publish your work and it will save you time, trouble and headaches!

B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This was a very good game. It  hard to find good games these days. I have to much fun playing this game.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I love all 3 seasons of Downton Abbey.  This one is especially nice because it finally comes full circle.  I do not like the way they ended the season.  However it will open to more struggles for next season.
B008PQ8XZK|3.0|The London Blitz is well conjured by  Morton's descriptive prose and though I would have liked a bit more convincing atmosphere, I have to say that there were some genuinely moving episodes. The description is a little adjectival, even florid, but beneath the outward show of style there is still always an emotionally charge to any reconstruction of a catastrophe like the bombing of thousands of people in a capital city. The over-description tends to slow the pace but once I had got nearly half way through I can't say I was disappointed.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I HAVE T H IS GAME ON MY PHONE AND ON MY TABLET ,I WAS ABLE TO GET THE UPDATE ON MY PHONE FOR THE MONTH OF JUNE (Miami) NOT ON THE TABLET JUST WANT TO SEE IF ANYBODY HAS THIS ISUE?
B00BUT5I84|4.0|It's hard to describe how I feel about this band. I grew up in the 60s and 70s, and listened to what I consider to be some of the greatest musical artists to walk this earth. Since sometime in the 80s, I've felt a decline in the creativity and innovation in rock music. Today I feel it's nearly dead. Then came 30 Seconds to Mars. I feel they started out promising but ordinary, and evolved to something close to greatness. I don't think they are there yet, but Beautiful Lie, This is War, and now this album are phenomenal and inspiring signs of what may be to come. I listen to their music, including the latest album, and I hear the subtle influences of Pink Floyd, Tangerine Dream, Vangelis, and other progressive rock bands from my youth. So you say they used heavy synthesizers? I say fantastic, so did the bands I mentioned as well as ELP, Genesis, the Who and so many others. You say they included instrumental songs on the new album? I say, great, so did the best progressive rock bands I've ever heard.<br /><br />I think 30STM will show their maturity when they can break past the arbitrary limits of 3-4 minute song lengths, and can record a 10-15 minute song with minimal vocals. Although, I have to say, Jared Leto's instrument is phenomenal in so many ways.<br /><br />I'm not going to break down the songs here, I wanted to paint a backdrop of context. I look forward to each and every future artistic endeavor of this band.
B0079TQHDO|5.0|I was reluctant initially to start reading Chronicles 2 straight after Chronicles 1 but i'm glad i did as it kept the whole story flowing.
B009EFP278|5.0|I use this cup everyday and its perfect. I can carry it around with me and doesn't spill when tipped over.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I LOVED THIS BOOK!!! Seriously one of the best I've read in awhile! Five stares for sure! I highly recommend it!
B004OR199G|5.0|This book combines with crazy sexy kitchen is the combination for success for any diet and good health I lost 75 pounds and I feel fantastic I recommend this book to anybody who's serious about losing weight and change
B00AH8FTT2|5.0|Archer has that unique ability to 'link' the three books together, each covering a totally different aspect of the story.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|I watched this movie about 7 times on cable, But when they stopped showing it, I went right Amazon & purchased the DVD.
B004G5ZY7E|5.0|First time I've read a Jo Nesbo book,  can't wait to get another!!! Either an ebook or a library book.in
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I wanted to read the book before seeing the movie, and I was not disappointed. It's a story of two broken people and how they heal
B00006IU73|5.0|This is an extraordinary album from Porcupine Tree. Every song is a masterful composition, making it extremely difficult to turn it off once you get into it.
B000AP04FG|5.0|Angelina Jolie has the most beautiful face I have ever seen, And Brad Pitt is agent ever. this is one of my all time favorite movies.
0743486285|5.0|Got here onetime..I can't wait to read this book.everyone I know said its great...I look forward to giving my own review
B00APUYWYA|3.0|This movie was good for a laugh and worth the few dollars to rent but I can't see myself watching it more than once. I understand why it was a pop culture hit.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|a good book, not a long read, thought provoking because the main character is flawed, not a perfect guy, a good price also
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|no time to help and they jumped right in and get excited w hen they level up<br />My 7 year old can't put it down
B00BESJYAY|5.0|This is a movie worth watching with your children. Teaching that it takes exceptional work and sacrifice to get exceptional results.
0441013074|4.0|My first Reynolds book and I will order another. Very good read, but you must get past page 126 before it takes off. I almost put it down before I got thru the first hundred pages, but after that I could not stop reading. The ending left me looking for a sequel. I enjoyed the build of anticipation of when the two main characters meet.
B000I3PA8Q|5.0|The classics Star Treks are great!  I would highly recommend watching all seasons/movies and may you live long and prosper.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is very entertaining I think that everyone should get this game it is awesome, fun ,funny,and loud . Get the his game it is not a waste of space
B001EBYM8A|5.0|Good story, terrific suspense and alternately very funny, Harrison Ford is on, but Tommy Lee Jones steals the show.  Enjoy!
1476734941|4.0|I have been doing 2  36 hr fasts per 7 days and I have lost 8 Kgs since started this form of diet.  I find it relatively easy and for most of the week I do not appear or feel like I am on a diet.  I can't say what effect it has had on my health but I had a full blood count sample taken today.  Fingers crossed for a good result.
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|If you love the Eagles you will love this DVD (Blue Ray) Especially if you are a Baby Boomer. Enjoy
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|This and &#34;name of the wind&#34; are my two favorites (LOTR excluded). Worth every minute reading this wonderful novel. Get it!
0062059963|4.0|I wasn't particularly thrilled with the first book, thought it was like reading a very long preview for The Bachelor on tv...and I don't like the show either...it was all back story and character description with a story set up towards the end. However the second book I really enjoyed. There was a lot of interaction between the characters and kept moving pretty good. It was a little irritating how moody America could be but also relatable to her situation. I never thought I'd bother reading this book after being so dissappointed in the first but I'm happy I did and will definitely read the final book...wish it was coming out sooner :)
B0000AUHPB|3.0|This is not my favorite movie either.  After seeing the remake of The Italian Job, I wanted to get the original, but was not impressed with it.  I like the actors alright, but wasn't that pleased with the story itself.  Okay movie, and great service with Amazon as usual.
159463176X|5.0|I just finished this book and now I wish I had not. I want to continue and not let it go. Where to begin? There are so many stories, so many emotions tapped, so many questions to ask. What struck me most was how so many people care for others and give up their own hopes and dreams to do so. And yet, their are others who desperately avoid these positions. The characters are so compelling and complex and leave one very introspective. Hosseini has his finger on the pulse of life in all its glory and despair. A must read!
B00992CF6W|4.0|Well, its ok.But there's no caves and it's hard to find ores.Also, there is no villages,pumpkins,wolves,ocelots, or villagers and you can't chat with people that aren't on skype or your house.There is no iron doors as well.I'm not blaming people,I'm just suggesting items for the next update.My sis and I are anxious to get our hands on it.:p
B002L3ARRU|5.0|This is one of those fun loving movies makes you feel good. If you like fun movies that remind you of your high school days this one is for you.
B00BGIC2J2|5.0|Great casting from a great director and writer! Paul Rudd is funny but respect the how the women lead the movie. Plus you can't go wrong with MEGAN FOX!<br /><br />All I have to say is, &#34;Bodies by Jason!&#34;
B003JTHXOK|4.0|&#34;Safe Haven&#34; caught and kept my interest throughout the whole story. I was looking for something that wasn't too deep but kept me wanting to read more. I am looking forward to seeing the movie now that I've read the book. I'd recommend it.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This book kept me on the edge of my seat.  This woman went though so much and has a wonderful honesty about her.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|It was awesome!!! be sure to watch as many of the old ones as you can before starting the 2005 series. there are a lot of references to those episodes.
B000MGUZM0|5.0|Just what I was expecting. Really love this band and the disc are in great condition. It also came with the complete manual and everything that came with it. Thanks!
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|I really enjoyed the dynamics between Brad Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence. This flick allowed you to see the real talent of both actors. Thought it was going to be more of a \\"chick\\" flick as my husband would say, but I think this movie would be enjoyed by anyone that enjoys relational dynamics in film. Well worth the time and the few dollars I spent on renting it!
159463176X|5.0|Khaled Hosseini writes like an angel and is one of my favorite authors.  His third book does not disappoint.  In fact, the reader is quickly drawn into a fascinating cast of characters as he so powerfully depicts them.  You begin to care about what happens to each one, hoping their lives turn out well even when you know they may not.  He is more like an artist carefully sketching a profile and shading it delicately with nuance and subtlety to create a complex and realistic personality.  This book was a page-turner for me and I was sorry to reach the end.  More, please!
B000A7S4B0|5.0|Just what I was expecting. Really love this band and the disc are in great condition. It also came with the complete manual and everything that came with it. Thanks!
B005PK57IK|5.0|shows complex relationships that cannot easily be resolved by one simple action or change by one of the characters or event
B0064MPXFA|5.0|When this first released, I made the mistake of judging the book by its cover, thinking it was a &#34;he done her wrong&#34; tale. Sick of the similar headlines of the day, I passed. Coming back around to it later, it has proven to be one of the best ensemble performances, smartest written series in recent history and the main reason, IMO, that CBS has ruled for the last few seasons among the three original primes. Besides becoming a fan of Julianna Margulies, and (Baltimore's own!) Josh Charles, Archie (Archana) Panjabi lights up, rather heats up, every scene she's in. Kalinda in knee-high boots, designer shades and a baseball bat is something to behold!
B0002IVN9W|5.0|Just what I was expecting. Really love this band and the disc are in great condition. It also came with the complete manual and everything that came with it. Thanks!

0345529057|4.0|I was very pleased with these books.  They are sturdy and the price is excellent.  I have checked on several sources.
B009NY43NY|4.0|Not one of the best of the series, but I like how Charlaine Harris wrapped everything up and Sookie has a more complete and caring world than she did at the start.  I also like the ending.  Sookie always belonged at her house in Bon Temps and it's a bonus she has someone caring to share it with.
0316227706|5.0|It was the perfect gift for my daughter's birthday. She loves animals but it was grown up enough for her.

B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This is a great book showing the humanity on BOTH sides during the war. Even without the chance meeting between Franz and Charlie, Franz's story alone would be worth the read.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|Michael Buble appeals to all ages and can add freshness to familiar songs + create new favorites with his smooth voice and style.
B0034G4P80|5.0|this was a great family movie to watch, can't wait to see the next one if there is going to be a next one, i would recommend this movie to anyone.
B004GYY714|3.0|It does as well as expected. Depending on your phone's internet connection it will buffer audio from your radio station at a reasonable rate.
B001DJLCPE|5.0|If you are looking for dark comedy and enjoy cold war films, this movie is a must see. Plus,if you're a movie buff like me, you'll enjoy all the extra features that went into making the film. Definitely recommend.
1401938906|5.0|Written with humor and simplicity.  Love the experiments.  I highly recommend this book for anyone who is seeking to understand the Law of Attraction.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|I ordered a film about this time in Queen Victoria's life and like it a lot.  When I saw part of this film on TV, I just had to add it to my British Film Collection.  The actors, costumes, and the whole film are more vibrant and than any others, and I'm so very glad I got it.
B00C4QLUFM|5.0|I've seen this movie so many times and every time its just as amazing as the first time! Definitely a feel good movie!
B005KGNN26|5.0|The orchestral versions of Peter Gabriel´s classics and dark song are amazing.<br />The HQ sound in Vinyl is amazing too.<br />Some moments it remember me The Wall of Pink Floyd.<br />The single bonus picture disc is really beautiful.
B005R32L66|1.0|Skype what is all the hype.  I hated it.  Didn't turn my tablet into the phone mecca I was looking for. Not very user friendly, and overall didn't allow me to make calls as expected.  As I can recall it required a subscription and had call restrictions that I can't remember but I do remember it was useless and not worth my time to download it to my tablet, only to have to remove it.  I suppose it is possible I didn't do it right, but if that I the case, I would say it is too complicated for my needs.  I was off to other more meaningful downloads.  Waste of time.
B000LX00RY|4.0|Great movie! Seen it plenty of times and every time am just as happy as the first time! Definitely a feel good movie!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Excellent graphics. Challenging. Can replay after a month or so and its just as challenging. Hope more rooms are added soon. Well worth the price.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|This classic is still riveting today. Such haunting characters. A real favorite.  I recommend it for anyone in this day and age who has not read it!
B002VUFKG6|5.0|I really enjoy Elizabeth's voice- honest, thoughtful, vulnerable, but with balanced sentiment. I think this book is a fascinating read for people in any stage of the love and marriage game. I love the honest and positive conclusions she comes to! Highly recommend!!
0545265355|5.0|I loved the three books, I didn't want them to end and the price was very good too. Loved the casing.
B0063IH60K|3.0|I'm a bit of a solitaire junkie, and this one is fine for my Kindle to waste time when I'm in an airport or sitting in traffic. I've played only a couple of times, and so far haven't found an &#34;undo&#34; button, but otherwise, it's ok.
B003Z39G0O|4.0|Like or loath the series the music tat accompanies it is definitely catchy and this selection is some of the best of it.<br /><br />There are definitely some stand out tracks - notably the one by bat for lashes. It's a soundtrack that will grow on you
1401229921|5.0|It's Jim Lee...nuff said!<br /><br />But to elaborate,<br />this book is the hush series complied into one graphic novel, no inks, no colors, just Jim Lee's pencil work, and man IT IS A TREAT!<br /><br />If you love grayscale work, this book is worth every penny!
B009M5CJI0|5.0|Ken Follett is such an amazing writer. This book was wonderful. It kept my nose in at all times. I laughed, I cried.... when it was over I was ready for the next one. This trilogy is great!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I am seven years old and I love this game.  My dad has it on his phone and I used to play it alot.  Now I play it on a Kindle.
B00AUA67GQ|5.0|I was not sure about this app when I got it but it works great, The fact that you can write into it directly without using the keyboard makes it so much easier to use. You can keep track easily of your notes because they are stored by date. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a simple way to take notes without a lot of hassle.
B00BF123WG|2.0|I struggle to find out why this movie got such favorable ratings.  As a movie, it is disjointed, stilted and has poor character development.  As history, it sucks with the exception of the final Abbottabad scenes.  It does depict open torture by the USA in a mildly positive way (imagine a movie doing the same thing about child molesters).  The central characters employ it openly, and we are supposed to be sympathetic about their efforts.  It does suggest that torture was essential to the effort.  Most of the actual participants say that is untrue (Rodriguez being the big exception).  The actual details of the most interesting part of the history -- the discovery of the courier and tracking him, are not well explained.  The composite lead character played by Chastain is drawn in a crap stilted manner.  She is grossly unprofessional in behavior (especially compared to the real people on which she is based - see HBO's Manhunt), which I guess was supposed to depict favorable maverick characteristics.  It just doesnt work, and she is essentially unlikeable.
B00C7O8MJ8|3.0|Giacchino's score for Into Darkness is one of the things about this movie that are noticeably better than the 2009 production. But WOW: the music that plays during the End Titles, which I've enjoyed both times I've watched the movie in a theatre, is missing entirely from this CD. Instead, we have \\"Star Trek Main Theme\\" which is labeled as containing music from the original series, but really only contains the opening bars of that Alexander Courage theme. I assume that Varese was unwilling to pay royalties for the full Alexander Courage theme, which Giacchino integrated and arranged beautifully. Well, we should all cry \\"FOUL\\"  -- especially Mr. Giacchino, who obviously takes great care in threading original franchise themes into his original work (no one has ever done it better). I would choose this CD in a heartbeat over the 2009 soundtrack album because the music has more range of feeling and I like the new. But I'm very disappointed at the unconventional decision not to include the End Titles music.
B003IKMR0U|5.0|LOVE this game .......SO much fun and easy to play as well as to learn....we take this game on all our trips and after playing it with others most go out and buy there own...the kids also love to play it....but if you buy this you should also buy the add on for it ....mix up the fun
B00C1BUYX4|4.0|Great history and a great movie.  It has a few scenes that dont play well (what I would describe as Speilberg's maudlin flaw - cant describe them here without spoilers and not enough space here to highlight similar moments in other works).  Lewis deservedly won the Oscar, but Field's portrayal as Mary Todd Lincoln was also great.  I have heard some express dissatisfaction with the melodrama of her role, but that was in fact her character.  So much of the mood of the movie is in fact a great truth to the actual history (as far as I know it), which is rare in movies.  Lincoln's behavior, as depicted in this movie (which only covers a short period of time but serves as a microcosm to the larger history), was careful, even plodding.  He was maddening to his contemporaries and frequently contradictory, but it masked a great and careful calculation, and deep introspection constantly reviewing his thinking to try and get it right.  He charted the most difficult decisions ever facing any American president, and mostly got it right.  The movie manages to bring out so many layers of the known history of these events - it is worth watching multiple times to absorb all of its depth.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|The book is very interesting and I like this kind of reading, when I have the time to relax and read !!
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|An unforgettable true story of faith, courage, mental toughness, teamwork, and leadership by example. Inspiring beyond words.  If you read just one book this year, make it this one!
B001R0LOES|4.0|Neeson is great in this role.  The movie is mostly very good history, although the writer/director badly misrepresented Bloody Sunday, and made use of a debunked de Valera quote at the end of the movie.  de Valera (played by the always spectacular Alan Rickman) is portrayed somewhat one-dimensionally, but the basic parameters of what he did are accurately described (motive is another thing harder to judge).  Highly recommend this one.
B009329ZF2|5.0|This movie was GR8 as far as I'm concerned !! It was as good as Battle Los Angels as far as I'm concerned !!
B008XG1X18|5.0|it has a lot of funny pictures and give you good clues to make a good gift for a friend
0446581348|5.0|WAS A GIFT AND THE PERSON LOVED IT THE IS NOTHING ELSE I CAN SAY SHE WAS HAPPY WITH THE GIFT
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Lark Rise to Candleford is a wonderful escape back to the late 19th century. There is just enough drama but not so much that it becomes ridiculous. The characters are all lovely and by the end of the season you feel as though they are friends. My daughter and I look forward to reading the books after we finish this series.
B001K3EXTA|4.0|Followed the book closely.  Looking forward to watching a new version.  The setting seemed especially true to the prohibition era.
0316286850|5.0|WAS A GIFT AND THE PERSON LOVED IT THE IS NOTHING ELSE I CAN SAY SHE WAS HAPPY WITH THE GIFT
B0094BB4TW|1.0|This app is awful, it does not refresh properly, won't allow you to switch from &quot;top news&quot; to chronological order without spending several minutes trying.  It's not worth the free cost - just use the website.
1451624468|5.0|yes, this book did it for me - best to know where exactly man has advance his understaning of the universe, rather than base it on santa clause stories!  great book for the free thinker
B006LSZECO|4.0|The writing was fantastic and the story compelling to read but I didn't like the crass language and sexual connotations.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|Great Bag for starters!<br />Small yet loads of space for my Camera Gear!<br />Held my D7000, five lens, two flashes, tripod, and the extra pockets great for SD cards and other small accessories!<br />Thinking of getting another very soon as a gift!
B006GWO5NE|1.0|It worked great when I first received it a couple weeks ago and then all of a sudden it quit. I haven't even had it for a month.  Not a good product at all.
0545101417|5.0|the book kept me in suspense all the way to the end , it ended well and left enough  curiosity to segway into the next book
B009UX2YAC|5.0|OMG! We luv this marvelous game! We give it 5 stars!!! We wish we could give it ten million stars though! We had our battery full when we started but now it's empty! You should really get it! It's also free! The company that made this has outdone themselves! We luv it!
B001ANSSDC|2.0|Generally, when I see a movie before I read the book, the film becomes a 90-minute commercial for the novel. That was the case for Silver Linings Playbook.<br /><br />Other than the Eagles, the movie and book have very little in common.<br /><br />Just because the film and novel are so drastically different isn't a reason my scoring was low. The only other example I can think of where I liked a movie more than a book is Forest Gump.<br /><br />The pacing is as frantic as the thoughts racing through the main character's troubled mind, and details were sacrificed in the process. What motivated him to fall in love with Tiffany? It's hard to tell when we learn so little about her.
0545091020|5.0|great read,  made you see the movie all over again and they followed this book VERY  well  It is a must to read
B00C5GZKVQ|4.0|This game is pretty well done &amp; I know that alot of people will love it. Just not me, I dont like fighting games, but that doesnt make it a bad game. I can tell it would be fun for people into that sort of thing. So I cant give it a low rating.<br />The controls arent confusing &amp; it doesnt lag. Theres a Free Flight/Play mode where u can practice, with or without an opponent. You have the option to use either the Joystick our the Gyro to control the helicopter &amp; you can adjust the sensitivity. The UI is comfortable &amp; it doesnt bombard you with adds or requests to rate constantly. At least it didnt for the 30 mins I tinkered around with it. The only negative I thought of was that you cant defeat the opponent in Free Flight mode. You just keep shooting it. Yeah it's good practice, but it couldnt teach me how many hits it takes to defeat them. They should have it so you can defeat it &amp; then it respawns so u can keep practicing. That way you learn how much it takes to beat the opponent, not just how to aim. But every other aspect of the game is well done. I recommend it to those who like battle games.
158270208X|5.0|This book is beautiful in presentation, in thought and in freedom to write your personal ideas.  I love the chance to think and write what I am grateful for in past and present tense.  It is a great gift I have given to a friend and the one I received was from a dear friend as well.  I rated it with 5 stars because it gives hope and solace to the soul!
0545101425|4.0|good book but  a bit drawn out for my taste  had a great ending but took to long to get there
B005TBWN0K|5.0|It allows you to search any website of your choice and then take a pic when your done. It saves those pics in the app and in your own pics. I LOVE THIS. It's like snap shot, but I prefer this one.
B007N8RULO|5.0|Play it often. Good mind candy. Makes you think somewhat, but if you get stuck there is the option for hints which is alway good.
193700788X|5.0|Great wrap-up of the entire series.  Charlaine Harris<br />hits it out of the ball park with this one.<br />Truly enjoyed it!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I couldn't put it down. I loved the ending. Connor is definitely every girls dream. As the saying goes, love  conquers all!
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|This is a really cool Jimi Hendrix CD there is all unreleased material on it and I like it allot. If your a Jimi fan I say give it a try !!
B009X2CVXA|5.0|This is the first book I have read by this author and Wow was I pleasantly surprised. I intend to purchase everything she has written. Her style of writing is so skillful that you get to know her characters as if they were part of your everyday circle of life and that they are sharing their emotions with you. The scenes vividly described so as you are transported to where its all happening. I love this style of writing as I can get &#34;so into&#34; a book, hours pass and I feel jolted back to reality when I have to put the book down.
B004WGIXX4|4.0|I don't really like romantic comedies. But this one was fun, probably because Portman is cute and had good chemistry with Kutcher.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Awesome game! Can't wait to play the next one! Definitely a unique game for players to immerse themselves in! 5 stars, best game I've played since myst!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This app is an amazingly well done strategy game. You must choose your plague and evolve its symptoms abilities and transmission. You unlock tons of new plague types as you play.The best thing is how unlike other apps it allows you to buy unlock things in the game but everything in this app can be unlocked simply by playing. This app is great and will give you tons of gameplay and has lots of replay value.
B00A77II0U|5.0|Interesting story, great graphics and engaging game play...and tho I wish it went on forever it was a decently paced length of play. More like this  please!!!!
0738737909|5.0|I'm giving this deck five stars because it's a beautiful deck, beautiful book and beautiful kit and the authors/artists don't deserve to have their ranking diminished for the publisher's issues. BUT some of the batch sent to Amazon is defective. Like another person said, many of the cards were stuck together, causing some of the card backing to come off on the cards. AND my copy also has a weird stripe of oddness at the top of each and every card. I've now heard of three people who all have the same complaints. And I've also heard of many others who received a perfect deck. I'm choosing to keep my deck rather than return it, because as GORGEOUS as these cards are, I won't use them often enough to care. But it's sub-standard and the worst issue I've ever encountered with a deck (primarily because I have had the fortune to always receive pristine decks). Lo Scarabeo dropped the ball on SOME copies. And all of those copies I've heard about so far--perfect and flawed--have come from Amazon. So be aware it's a crap shoot ordering from here for the time being. That said, Amazon has some of the best customer service in the world from my experience, So if you get a bad one, they'll make good on it for you. But just know this is an issue happening on SOME decks. But the deck art is every bit as gorgeous as you hope it would be, and the book is well written. I highly recommend this deck.
B002ZCY7PU|4.0|It is a good third season of Chuck. It is very entertaining and I especially liked the storyline with Kristin Kreuk in it.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I am enjoying the game a lot.  I really like the idea of it being never ending.  It's a great killing time game but is hard to put down.
B003L77GG0|5.0|An excellent tenth and final season of Smallville. The DVD-set contains additional Scenes and Background Information which is really great.
B000W7JWUA|2.0|Catan is a wonderful game to play. But this edition is made very cheaply. It held up well the first few uses, but by game number 8, the pieces are already not going together well. For a $10 board game, I'd expect that. But for what Catan costs, they should make it sturdier.
B004XWLN20|5.0|This complete set of all the Smallville-DVDs has some excellent Bonus Clips, Information, deleted Scenes, etc. A true must for a real Smallville-Fan.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Works great and is easy to enter numbers.  Loads quickly and is able to perform basic operations well and as quickly as a calculator.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I just started watching this show. I love it! I'm totally addicted. I watch 3 or 4 episodes a night - no commercials! I totally recommend this show.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|Pretty good java based game, similar to farmville. So far no issues with the game loading or the game play. If you have kids then watch out for buying more peanuts with real money.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|This is such a strange game, that will easily have you playing all night.  In 2 days I have gone through 11 worlds, and have to tell myself to stop playing and go to bed.  Definitely suggest this to others!!
B004YW4L5K|3.0|I could not stay in the story. How do I know which books I have to return or can I return them all
B005HSG3U6|5.0|I bought this to not only be extra protection for my Kindle Fire (because I have a bad track record with broken devices) but also to serve as a stand so I could take notes in class.  This was perfect!
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I thought this book was going to be a light read ... Definitely has to be read with an Irish accent in your head ... But then it really surprised me with how clever the background story was and then ending was just wonderful.  Highly recommend this book as a great read.
B0089AD8IO|5.0|There's not much to be said here other than this is a fantastic show that I would recommend to anyone to give a chance!!
B005LAIHRC|5.0|I am an 80's boy ...  LOVED THIS MOVIE ... watch it to learn ...  watch it to remember ...  what ever you do ...  WATCH IT !!!
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|Love it , brings so many memories of love and of love lost, for all of life, recalling Summer love, loosing the love of your life, and being in love with a navy man.
B00C1BU7V8|1.0|This is just a terrible revision of history.Sally Fields as the activist first lady was just too stupid to stomach.Its like going to a cheap local play.I could not sit through this horrible movie.I gave it a half hour and then just found something better to do.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I was never a fan of the original Star Trek series but I can sympathize with fans of it who were mad or disappointed. However, I thought this movie was just incredible. There's never a dull moment, the action is spectacular and the dialogue scenes are well written and engaging. The acting was good across the board, particularly Benedict Cumberbatch as Khan. DefiniteIy a memorable and terrifying villain (\\"You.... Should have let me sleep!\\" crushes a mans head in his hands.). Definitely recommend it to any fans or action and sci fi films, but if you're a hardcore fans of the original series there's a chance you'll be disappointed. On a side note, some were angry with pasty skinned Cumberbatch's casting as Khan because the character is supposed to have fairly dark skinned. However a lot has changed in the past decade and casting a dark skinned actor as a terrorist type villain who ends up killing 42 people in an bombing and possibly thousands more in a starship crash might be just a tad bit racy.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|Loved this movie.. Such a positive message for young and old.  I would highly recommend this movie even if you aren't a sports fan.
B00006AW2G|5.0|The Rolling Stones are fantastic, there's no denying it. This album is no exception to that. It really sums up the feeling of the late sixties, and all of the changes that were happening both in music and in the world in general. 'Let It Bleed' is a great reminder of how to make an unforgettable record.
B004EPYZV2|5.0|The fourth installment in the Mission:Impossible franchise is the best in my opinion!!! And the blu-ray is fantastic! I love it!
B000H5TVJY|5.0|I've seen this movie so many times, and it never gets old. It's a beautifully put-together move, and Christian Bale is perfect as Patrick Bateman. Fantastic!
B00AB55BS0|5.0|Amazing and breathtaking &#34;Game of Thrones&#34; gets even better on Blu-ray!  An exquisite box for all GoT fans! Worth the money!
B000WTNCYA|5.0|For some reason, I thought I already knew this artist's music, as I already had My One and Only Thrill and The Absence.  Then I bought this one.  Oh my goodness...this woman has an amazing voice and even more amazing story.  Her voice is silky, sultry, soothing, and fabulous.  The music just puts me at ease, and I really like the different &#34;feel&#34; of the various songs on this, her first album.  Not to be missed is &#34;Some Lessons,&#34; which tells the personal story of her accident, but still hits home for anyone who has learned important life lessons 'the hard way.'  She is phenomenal...I am so glad I bought this one...it is her BEST!
B0060MYM7O|5.0|It only gets better with the second season of &#34;Game of Thrones&#34;. Like season one, the blu-ray box is finely detailed and a must have for the fans! Can't wait for the third season to arrive!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I would recommend this to anyone.  Loved it!  Can't wait to see what happens next season.  Only wish there were more episodes.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I was very impressed by the way our Navy Seals killed Osama Bin Laden.  They are unbelievable in their<br />training and put their lives on the line for our beloved country.  They also do not want any publicity or<br />adulation.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I would recommend this to anyone.  Loved it!  Only wish that there were more shows each season.  Can't wait to see what happens next!
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|A great show! It is really too good and it's meant for all ages!! A must see for anyone into claymation!
B0040I09RM|4.0|This is a little violent, but it has very good under lying messages.  The character development is quite good, and it shows a different side of life to what most of us have been exposed to.
0802473156|5.0|This is a great way to learn about you and your spouse and how to fill each others tank.  Just because a woman likes getting gifts and flowers doesn't mean that's what makes your husband happy....it is important to know your spouses love language so you can fill each others tank in the most efficient way and stay connected in marriage.  Remember marriage is hard work and every thing we can do to make it easier is worth it!
B00C33M2EE|5.0|Loved the scenery with the variety of locations that the Guys and lady performed the different pieces of music with great energy and enthusiasm.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|I enjoyed the book, light reading but interesting. I would recommend it to others. Made the movie more interesting and enjoyable.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Love the music for its' style, sound and originality. These Guys are extremely accomplished musicians that have an exceptional grasp on creativity.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|It's so awesome the great white shark isn't the final shark they have megalodon  too  you can see it only when you experience  the great white first.
B009GED1IY|3.0|Love this movie the extra scenes were awesome.If you loved it when it first came out you will love the extra footage .
B00C33M2EE|5.0|The piano guys have never been disappointing guys. Haha<br />I feel more energetic when I listen their music.<br />Thank you guys. Thanks Amazon
B005544TRQ|5.0|Love the dynamic between the characters. Kept me engaged fro the first episode up unit the current Season 2 finale.
B00991TCOG|4.0|Needless to say awesome.<br />My favorite is Moon trance. It is great. You should check this on You tube.<br />The only minor thing I didn't like is the condition of CD case. Maybe because I ordered abroad, the case was damaged. CD had no damage. That's it.<br />Thank you
B008H6GH8I|5.0|I love all resident Evil games and now I love this movie. I thank you very much for this item :-)
B008D30K7E|5.0|I loved this book. The characters are engaging; the storytelling style deceptively simple and quirky. The narrative is breathtaking in it's depth of history and political knowledge while at the same time being interspersed with the hilarious adventures of the the main character, Allan.  Allan is an explosives expert and also a born philosopher, but if you were to suggest this to him he would probably be baffled by the notion. This book is a great holiday read.
B006Y5H74W|5.0|Very dramatic. Outstanding performances from the entire cast, especially from Kathrine Mcphee. Loved every bit of it. Can't wait for more!
B00992CF6W|4.0|This game uses all kinds of different elements like building,eating,mining,ETC.<br />I mean,the price is very low,which makes it available for lots of people. Just one question before I go: When's This 0.7.0 being released?<br /><br />~Shadow9000low
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book related to the problems people face in families with this disease.  I recommend it to anyone with bipolar in their family.
B00AE9UYJ4|3.0|Slender Man! Chapter 1: Alone was a game I downloaded because I thought the computer version of Slender by Parasec was a game you had to pay for before downloading. This is a big honkin' review, and I really hope it helps some people. I may be a bit nit-picky, so if that bugs you, this may not be the review for you.<br /><br />I will say this right now, if you are reading this review and are thinking about buying this game for your tablet, STOP! If you have a computer that would be capable of running it, the full Slender: The Eight Pages game BY PARASEC is available for free. Just make sure you're going for Slender: The Eight Pages rather than Slender: The Arrival. (If you want free, that is.)<br /><br />But sadly, not all of us have that privilege, so we may be limited to a KindleFire. If you don't mind paying a dollar, this game can be almost as good as the real Slender.<br /><br />Almost.<br /><br />There were a few problems with it. There is a &#34;day&#34; and &#34;night&#34; setting, available right off the bat, but there isn't really any difference. I understand that it's only a KindleFire app, but the &#34;night&#34; is just as bright as the day with a darker color scheme. This is somewhat fixed by turning ON the &#34;fog&#34; setting. As for the &#34;day&#34; setting itself, it looks like they took the grays from the night and lightened them a bit.<br /><br />Speaking of those grays, I was a bit disappointed that the game has no color. Well, most of it-- select objects have color, and that makes them stick out extremely awkwardly and made the daytime setting kind of depressing. I get it-- horror game, yes, but it could use a bit more color, even if they are very dark.<br /><br />Now, as for Slendy himself, he seems pretty okay. Y'know. Meh. He doesn't have too much of a &#34;disturbingly scary, so much so that you'll have nightmares until you hit menopause&#34; kind of scare factor, but SERIOUSLY. I jump when I turn around and see him just lurking there...eerily... (And by the way, if you die during gameplay, however you died is the start-up screen until next you die-- so you GET TO SEE SLENDY CLEARLY!) The Slenderman model in the game doesn't look, to me, like Slendy should. The ends of his suit sleeves are torn up and his face is just too... humanlike. His hands, as well, bug me as they look like werewolf claws!<br /><br />He also tends to make the screen fuzz up whenever he's within a certain range of you, which is understandable, and in some cases very frightening. But he is generally only behind you, and the range is pretty large, which can make the static screen effect very obnoxious and unnecessary.<br /><br />I was very impressed with the maps. They were large, and while the &#34;Road&#34; map had a very definitive path to it, the &#34;Farm&#34; map was so large, and with so many locations for pages, that it seems like it would be very easy to get lost in. Kudos on that.<br /><br />The overall scare factor is kind of dulled by the environment's lack of atmosphere, and Slendy doesn't quite seem up-to-snuff. But otherwise, if you're looking for Slender on your tablet, this is pretty close.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This book was somewhat predictable, but I did not expect the surprise ending.  The subject matter made me somewhat uncomfortable.  I will probably read his other books.
B00AEFY3MC|5.0|I love this movie. . . it's funny, quirky, good acting, wonderful writing and cannot adequately be described by me. I enjoy it every time I see it!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|A real page turner! A nice wrap up to the series and a fun read with some unexpected twists. I'm sure she knew she couldn't please everyone no matter what boy Katniss ended up with, and she did a good job anyway.
B001UTW7QU|4.0|Almost didn't make it as the show started off slow, but I ended up liking it a lot (after the third or so episode). Walter is a hoot and the subject mater is intriguing. Will continue to watch. FYI Unearthed is a special that was originally unaired in season 1. Just thought I'd mention in case anyone else was left confused as to how it fits after the season 1 finale (episode 20: There's More Than One of Everything).
B00CRWJ7VC|2.0|I wasn't sure what to expect when viewing this movie. I like both principal actors (Tom Hanks and Halle Berry).  The story line is a bit ambitious and all over the place (non-linear). The special effects were impressive, but viewers nowadays are not as easily enamored or swayed by pretty visuals alone. I can't think of another movie quite like it, but that may be due to my poor memory ;)<br /><br />This would be a movie to watch out of pure curiosity at a friends house who already has it in there video collection.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|5 Stars! Selection is great and app is easy to use.  Well worth the small investment if you have trouble relaxing.  Very enjoyable.
B003UESJFG|5.0|I watch this one over and over. I don't really like Will Ferrell but he is so good as Megamind! Tina Fey's character is awesome too. Cute plotline, fun characters, watch it!
B0030MTQNW|5.0|An excellent WW2 film. Acting was great.  Action was terrific. Very realistic account of an invasion that went awry. Very well planned out, but as often with the best laid plans, reality doesn't always work out.
B005LAIHSQ|4.0|Cool movie. Not sure I'd want to watch it over and over. Great price for a combo pack though. Thanks!
193700788X|1.0|This book sucked.  I have read all of the books. I  even bought the box set of the first 8 for a friend. Harris really disappoints in this final installment. Not only is the ending unsatisfactory, she marginalized Eric throughout the novel, relegating him to a minor character. You never get a feeling of resolution and his actions (or inaction) in this book seem out of character. Really, I can't think of one thing I enjoyed about this novel.
B00821OX98|4.0|Obviously I picked up the series after watching the walking dead but there are a lot of similarities. A rag tag group of survivors facing incredible odds soldiers on knowing their way of life is over no matter the outcome of the conflict. while the main threat is ever present and daunting, it is the human element they must battle in order to survive. There are some classic tropes that are used but not overplayed. I had a hankering for some sci-fi and missed this series when it was originally aired. Defiance left a horrible, bad, not so happy feeling about the future of sci-fi on television. Falling Skies has given me hope. I can't wait till the season 3 premier.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Yet again, Halfbrick has created a great game. The premise is simple and amusing: you have a jetpack, and you must do whatever it takes to fly (or run) as far as you can and collect all the coins you can. Like in Fruit Ninja, it starts easy and becomes increasingly difficult as you progress. A theme I've seen in other HB games is the subtle humor that could make Batman giggle; Jetpack Joyride retains this very well. From easy and fun gameplay to dropping nuclear bombs on yourself to go as far as possible; this game is another of HB's masterpieces.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|the type of game worth playing at a slow pace so as to not miss a beat...just curious if all these weapons that require purchase by jewels be attained in the game as you level up or fight
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Everything is great excepted lack of increase in  prize as a reward for achievment in scrat challenge. Acorns are expensive.
B0085TKAW6|5.0|great book - good to hear the german's people side of the war - can't wait until the next book
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|this game rocks love it love it love it LOVE IT!!!!!! Gives you something to do and is really fun
B0098460O4|5.0|Great music. I love my Together CD from Amazon.com. I have enjoyed listening to them sing since I first heard them on BGT.
B0013D69YE|5.0|One of her best albums ever. She is very talented and this was a great beginning and her best to date
B00AB7HESI|4.0|scribblenauts has always been fun, now even more since its on a bigger screen then the iphone and ipod. go scribblenauts!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Very good. I don't read romance very often but I would definitely read this one again.  Good author and book
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|Great story of their history, what a wonderful group.  I would recommend it to anyone who loves the Eagles and their music.  It is epic.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|I rented this movie for my 1st grade class as a reward. They were captivated! Loved it :)<br /><br />A few patches of the movie froze & glitched, but I thought it was our poor Internet at school. Just got an email from Amazon apologizing with a refund. How credible of them!<br /><br />So.... I'd highly recommend the movie & streaming through Amazon :)
B000SO7OL6|5.0|Diana Krall in my lifetime is the best female singer and pianist I have ever heard. I will buy every CD she will make and even go to her concert in October.
B008602KQI|2.0|I'm glad i didn't waste my time on this movie when it was in theaters. Boring, drawn out, no conclusion, didn't care about the characters, bad acting. Don't bother. Though I'm sure the book is good, this movie is bad.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Love this app! Lets you listen to your music and find new music all in the same app! Mine is connected to the Cloud so I get all my music on my PC listed right here in this app!
B005HEVBGG|5.0|Great show, I have watched all the seasons several times now. I love it each time i watch it over the years, grew up watching it with my father so it brings back good memories.
0670014893|4.0|I don't understand the comments about this book being anti-American. It isn't. It is anti-mercenary, and that is very understandable- American wars are supervised by mercenaries these days, large companies for hire (think Blackwater) who place American soldiers in harm's way, make enormous profits and whose motives are purely financial. I don't know how we got to this place. This is a whole other issue for another book.<br /><br />LeCarre as always writes well. This is a great page-turner. What stopped me from giving this 5 stars is that the motivation for Toby's behavior is not clear. Frankly the collateral damage in the events central to the book do not seem to merit the gallantry shown by some of the protagonists, some of whom one would expect to be quite immune to military excesses, and Toby is a bystander not directly involved in the events in question and with no baggage accrued from his minor role as an observer to explain why he is willing to risk all by blowing the cover story.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|If you are a fan of the old school style spaceship shooters, then definitely give this game a try. Similar to Galaga or Galaxians, but with the added ability to move around the entire screen as opposed to only the lower 1/3 of the screen. Adjustable controls in several control schemes let you fine tune how you control your ship. The graphics are crisp and detailed with plenty of cool eye candy effects, plus loads of weapon and shield power-ups. The game has a pretty tight control and seems to handle even more precisely using a stylus as opposed to your finger - which also helps keep the view of the game screen unobstructed. 80-something levels of progressive difficulty to keep you blasting until the wee hours of the morning...
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This romance features very believable, charming characters and felt authentic, not trying to paint a quad's life all in rose colours... It made me laugh, it made me cry, and it made me reflect a lot on what really matters in life.
B003G94BZC|5.0|I never watched any of the other Dr Who shows, but I love this.  Matt Smith is funny and cool.
B006TF6WAM|4.0|This was a good novel with many heart-warming moments, however it did not leave me with such a lasting impression in the end...Though I really liked how the marriage of the main character evolves throughout his pilgrimage. And how he copes with all the attention. There is something enlightening about wandering the earth in any case, and the book grasps that very well.
193700788X|5.0|Love the Sookie Stackhouse novels. This was bittersweet knowing it is the last in the series. I have read everyone & enjoy all the things she gets hero.  Reading about the Sexy Eric is delious.  Read it even if you haven't read the whole series.  It will get you hooked and you will want to read them all from first to last.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|i like this fun simple yet addictive app.  easy enough for my youngsters to play but challenging enough for me to enjoy as well.
B001EN71CW|5.0|Some love it, some hate it... I don't care cause FIREFLY IS OUTSTANDING<br /><br />Sci Fi, Western, Action, Adventure, FUNNY<br /><br />Probably the best show cancelled early in the history of the tube.<br /><br />It's disgusting the crap TV (jersey shore, keeping up with Kar...whatever, grey's anatomy :) that get multi seasons on air  and this show gets a small handful of episodes. People are stupid!<br /><br />Anywho, I own it on blue ray.... &#34; you can't take take the skies from me!&#34;  SHINY
B005VPRET4|4.0|Need I say more, perfect birthday gift for a lego fan. She had it assembled in record time and was thrilled
B000PC0U1W|5.0|&#34;Why won't you die?&#34;  &#34;Because behind this mask is more then just flesh... Behind this mask is an IDEA... And ideas ... are bullet proof!&#34;<br /><br />Great cast, everyone is good but Hugo is the STAR...  Shows how to act while wearing a mask... (Take note Marvel!) can't even begin to explain how great Hugo is in this... Remember Remember
0374275637|3.0|are worth reading, the rest is rehash and not useful for today's business person or marketing person so just read the first 60
B004ZJZPXO|5.0|The best thing that could ever happen to us brown coats ( firefly fans for you lame people). Great Sci Fi movie... I aim to misbehave :)
0307352153|4.0|Great for any management person looking to improve on his relations with all employes.  Not to mention a good read
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Loved this story it was so moving and you were inside or should i say you were outside looking in to the heart and soul of a cancer patient !!  I rated this a 5 it was so moving I even cried ...  well , I am in to stories so what can I say ? ha ha  No  Mr. John Green it was a great book and I read it because I am in a book club and this was chosen to be read in June !!  I have read it by the end of May !!!  Very good book !!
B00785P2QC|5.0|Great game. Love that it keeps me busy. No real complaints except that it is very hard to get invest points.
B00CKOYVG8|4.0|This is not the most challenging game, but it is fun to play. I like trying to hit the &#34;screens&#34; and watching the resulting chaos.
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|I am lucky this app was for free. I hats this game. All you do is sit around and wait tot things to happen. Do not get.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This is what you would expect from a Nicholas Sparks book. Usually I read the book before the movie and I did the opposite with this. I probably don't have to say it but the book was far better than the movie. And I liked the movie.
B009GXHOW4|5.0|I can turn dirt into diamonds. I impress my friends with the reasoures I have. It couldn't get any better than this
B002WV5A9G|4.0|Liked the premise.  Anxious to see the new one.  Equates to Batman Begins and we learn how it all started.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Fun game. I connect with my brother and play this all the time. It is fun and allows my creative side to show.
B005ZUR724|5.0|This is an amazing game!!!! If you like multiplayer RPGs, this is the game for you! Works fine on Kindle fire.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I'm having fun nice app I think that kids wold love this app it's a little confusing but it's fun
B005FLX2WC|5.0|The joke is that JB is the best guitar player you have never heard of... PBS did a great show, now I have heard of him, and he is great... BH has the perfect voice to go with JBs powerful riffs...a great match!
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|I just love it when Loki claim himself a god and The Hulk whaps him arround like a rag doll and mumbles \\"puney god\\" as he walks away....
B008VQXOGC|5.0|This CD is amazing. Ever since I purchased it I've been on the look out to see when she will be in concert in my city. It just so happens she is and I purchased tickets, can wait to hear her live.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|don't listen to the one review it does not keep crashing and closing just depends on the other games you have but ...... the game os awesome with cool dresses and everything
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This is a great app! I have trouble sleeping and now I just pick a nightly sound(s), set the handy timer and I am sleeping peacefully and through the night!
000725802X|3.0|There is magic in the prose, but a book that moves back and forth from past to present is sometimes hard to follow.  I can work with that when the full text is present, but I am listening to an ABRIDGED version which complicates everything.  Had I known this was abridged, I would not have purchased it.<br /><br />My rating is for the abridgement, not for the whole novel.
B008VSEJPK|5.0|This is the most thorough book on mixing I have found. I found it to be very helpful  and Mike is an excellent communicator. I would highly recommend it. Also his Web site that allows you to download songs for practice is extremely helpful.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I have to correct pizzarmare. this game is way way better than temple run! I can barley put my kindle down now.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|This is a great white noise app! I've tried others, and this is by far the best. It DOES allow you to mix sounds, contrary to other reviews. The loops are smooth. There IS a quit option under the menu key.  Definitely try this app!
B00821OX98|5.0|It only took 1 episode to get hooked so prepare yourself! If you like revolution style shows this one will fit in with a science fiction twist.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|I played it nonstop for two days, and beat it. Still downloaded on my device, I may come back to it and play through it again. Lots of fun!
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|I LOVE this show!! I love being able to watch it from the beginning via the DVDs! Great extras!! Enjoying every minute!
B003WKOU0G|3.0|Content is cute. But there are too many movie preview ads which cannot be skipped. Tried to watch with family, but they got bored with previews and gave up. Finally I watched alone.
B00847KFDS|4.0|I am real fan of CCR and John Fogerty. I wasnt that thrilled to hear of the remakes but after listening to the album Overall i did like it, I wouldnt say loved it though, to me the best song is almost saturday night. That song was not that big of hit so it hasnt been played that much and keith urban really kinda grooved it to his style of country, which i do like.<br />The 2 new song were pretty good and mystic highway is like a tribute to fogerty and the years he's played music and looking at how the end maybe coming.
098555780X|5.0|I have J.D.'s first book and thought that it was great. This book is Spectacular! Color photos with different colored cord makes it easier to follow the knot tying process. I have been a knotting enthusiast since the mid 60's, (ABOK), having tied a Lot of knots. I am sure that J.D.'s books and videos has inspired a lot of people to learn knot tying.
B009GX7IRA|4.0|Wasn't sure how this worked when I purchased. I thought it was still going to be sent as a DVD set; however, this has turned out to be okay because its right on my computer and I can watch each episode when I can. It resumes from where I stopped at any time and the clarity and sound is great! Amazon.com never disappoints me!
B0031RSBS2|5.0|Another excellent production by Lee Child. I just hope that the Jack Reacher stories keep the same momentum as those that have gone before. Lee Child has a knack of putting in clues that even the experienced &#34;Reacher&#34; afficianados miss the first time through.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I don't think how the book was written is what should be reviewed. I actually appreciated her style and the way she &#34;skipped&#34; around (unlike some reviews...). I felt like it was in her own voice, the way her story should be told. I can't imagine what she went through and how she survived those years but she did and she is now making the most of it. She is an inspiration. It must have taken great courage to relive the accounts she mentions in the book. While I did not &#34;enjoy&#34; her story I appreciated the fact that she made the most of her life and is doing her very best to live her life now with her daughters.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I love this app because it give the opportunity to open other apps that required this reader. I will recommended this product 100%
B009NY43NY|3.0|I have very much enjoyed all of the previous Sookie Stackhouse books, but this one left so much to be desired. It was predictable, with no mystery what-so-ever.  I did like the fact that Sookie and Sam sorta got together, but I didn't like how things ended with Sookie and Eric. This was definitely the worse of the series thus far, but because I am addicted to the series I will continue to read the books, but I just hope that Charlaine reaches back to the imaginitive stories she used in the previous Sookie Stackhouse books.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I love this app because it give the opportunity to learn more about everything. I will recommended this product 100%
1607107325|5.0|This is a very nice book, with an excellent design and a very low price. I absolutely recommend it to any book lovers!
B004UJST78|5.0|I love this book because it give the opportunity to learn more about the subject. I will recommended this product 100%
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Love the graphics, sounds and the story line. It's fun to play, very engaging and highly recommend it for your kindle.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|What an amazing American. Hard to read all that he went through only to be killed by a nut at home in the US. Great story and an inside look at the job our guys are doing for us everyday.
B002JXK5VU|5.0|Another syfy series which entertains like Warehouse 13. Looking forward to the other seasons.makes my prime membership well worth the cost.
B002JXK5VU|3.0|Two stars knocked off due to the constantly fluxing and even occasionally dropping of the series. More then once on a few episodes I had to refresh the entire page to get it to load.
B005TVYVI2|4.0|I've only used it twice so far, but I've been very happy with the Tempo Trainer. It's very easy to use, the audible beep seems to be just the right volume. I've only used the pacing feature, and it's been a big help. About the only downside is that it is a bit bulky for what it's doing. It's not terrible, but a few mm smaller would be noticeable when tucking into the swim cap.
B00CFITJKW|4.0|I really like the game the only things I would improve is the geography and the weather also you should be able to control the plane by rotating the entire kindle
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I love these type of games. Wishing this wasn't so shortened asking to purchase before u can finish the first part of game. Of course I will purchase cuz these games are addicting.
B0053O89KG|5.0|I can't get enough of the antics of Richard Castle and Kate Beckett.  &#34;She's Armed and he's dangerous.&#34; Murder and Mayhem, the author and the detective are ready for anything.  I can't wait until Season 5 is out on DVD and the beginning of Season 6 this fall.  In the words of Mikey, &#34;Try it.  You'll like it.&#34;
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|I wondered how they were going to do this show without making it annoying that Hannibal is not obviously the prime suspect in all cases.  However, the cast was well chosen and then stories within the stories are interesting and enjoyable.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|I have no issues with this book.  I bought it to read to my son, however, did not realize the language difference.  Twain writes in his time, and well, let's face it, language changes over time.  But the book is still great for an adult reader.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|When I picked this book up I did not know what I was getting into until I started reading it. EXTREMELY HOT AND BOTHERED! My husband was happy though cause I was always in the mood after reading a chapter or 2. LOL
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|First of all, I'm a fan of Tom Cruise and good action flicks. With that said, Tom was excellent in the role and the movie moved at a very good pace with plenty of action, and twists.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|All i gotta say is WOW! A great ending for just a great series!!! The other 2 are hot as well as this one but this book takes the cake for the ending!
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Fantastic performances by all the actors in the film, an excellent story, and a great Hollywood ending. What more could you want in a great drama. This is a great movie!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved the first and this one is just as interesting if not more when it comes to Christian. More stuff is revealed and not to mention the hot sex....OMG! LOL
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|I really enjoy Steven Soderbergh's movies, and this is one of his finest. A fine thriller with excellent acting and a good story line. I really enjoyed Jude Law's performance.
B00AO7HQ06|5.0|I was on the fence about purchasing this set since I have all the Allman Brothers albums as well as Duane Allman Anthology 1 and 2.  However, i took the plunge and I am thrilled that I did.  The set includes many out of print songs from Duane's studio work with Delaney & Bonnie, Wilson Pickett, etc.<br /><br />The box set notes were ok - i wished there was more information about the studio tracks, how they were recorded, etc.  rather the notes focus on the credits, with no editorial.  Too bad.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Duane Allman and interested in his career outside the Allman Brothers Band, this set is an absolute must.  If you are primarily interested in Duane's work with the Allman Brothers, stick with those albums.
B00CFAHSEO|5.0|It's amazing to listen to the wonderful music these talented guys come out with, giving us renditions of current hits to enjoy without the 'chatter'.... so relaxing and yet at times invigorating. All 4 of them do such a great job on the videos too! I just love listening and watching them... and can't praise them enough.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|Have only played approx 15 min but seems to work perfectly on my Fire mk2.  You can choose how you want to control your vehicle, and the graphics are seem less.  Oh, you can also adjust the graphics (make it look better or worse) if your device seems to stutter or turn them up to look better.  While I have not tried to adjust my graphics, it does seem like a good idea.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I really liked the theme and scope of Brooks' global Zombie War saga, but I didn't like the interview-based style.  It prevented me from relating to the characters and it was a bit hard to follow.  But I did enjoy the book.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|For a FREE game this is surprisingly good...few drawbacks...one being item cost is a little high...but all in all its worth it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I absolutely love the character development that has happened over the course of all three seasons, and I admire very much the philosophical questions concerning right/might, good/bad, individuality/community raised in each episode of this season.
B009NY43NY|3.0|I found the ending rather abrupt and I found myself wondering what happened to some of the other storylines. I had to read it to end the series and i was satisfied with who Sookie chose.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I absolutely adore the way these familiar tales are interwoven and given new life by way of interpreting the characters as real world people. It's just marvelous... And the details even go down into the characters' names (eg August = stoic = wooden = Pinnochio; Blanchard = whitener =&#62; Blanche = white = Snow White; Regina = Latin for queen; etc.). I just love it. I cannot wait to see season 3, but I am excited for Wonderland as well...
0061438294|4.0|I expected more practical tips. Overall, interesting lecture that makes you become aware of the nonverbal language around you and pick up nuances of others' messages.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|OMG!! How could they end it like that??? I started yelling, &#34;NO!!! NO NO NO NO!!!&#34; about 45 seconds before the end of the season finale... How awful (and yet perfect, from a narrative stand point). The writing is beautiful, the production is stunning, and the performances are hypnotizing. I absolutely cannot wait for season 4... HURRY UP ALREADY!
B00CHI5B7A|4.0|The ads did this film no justice, I guess they tried to modernize it to get younger film goers, how silly. This film had everything a true Angeleno would appreciate and to know these guys really existed, well one could say that it explains a lot about LAPD and it's questionable past.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|This is the greatest game ever I loved it.I have completed  all of the levels. The best ever. Yes ever ever!
B007Z9QP3K|5.0|I served on submarines in the navy and without a doubt this is the best movie ever made about submarine service.
1449437524|5.0|Somewhat &#34;earthy&#34; humor, but it illustrates the paradox perfectly. It makes you question which species is truly superior to the other.
B005OYKIJ0|5.0|How can you go wrong with this excellent cast. This is action packed, fun to watch, great music and completely entertaining!
0679805273|5.0|I bought two of these. I'm using them as a &#34;through the years&#34; yearbook of sorts for my children, having their teachers write letters of encouragement inside so I can gift it to them on graduation day. (Not my original idea-Thanks Pinterest!) The book itself brought tears to my eyes. It is a Dr. Seuss classic that can apply to any age. I'm more than happy with my purchase! :)
B008VBYN80|3.0|Alright game overall. Good for spending a few minutes. Wish purchasing heroes wasn't dependent on gems, but that's all. So, it's playable.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Great read for a lazy day, really enjoyed this book and the feeling of true love is wonderfully made in this story.
B005HED11Y|5.0|I give it a five star because it was better than the first time I saw it in the 8th grade.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|It's great to not have to connect my Kindle Fire or Samsung Galaxy to the computer to move files back and forth. Type in the IP address and I'm IN!
B006YTTVHO|4.0|I enjoyed Always Know What to Say as it has many helpful conversation starters and helpful tips.  A lot of information and quick read.
0307887448|2.0|I actually listened to the audiobook and begrudgingly followed through. The book is a complete pander fest for the \\"geek\\" crowd. Will Wheaton narrating exacerbate it over the edge. The excessive exposition though was what phoned it in for me. There's too much world building and backstory to trudge through. I really don't get the high praise and am pretty disappointed with it overall. I feel like \\"Ready Player One\\" is an excuse to talk about 80's videogames and movies.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Excellent ending to a fantastic series. I enjoyed the way all the loose ends were tied up. I would recommend this book highly.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|Great book i own all of his books everything tied together nicely. Im really proud of this series and especially this book. Way to go James!
B0000DI86O|5.0|This is my favorite Italian opera.  I sent it as a gift and the recipient is loving it as much as I loved sending it.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Excellent show. I haven't checked lately, but hope the next season is available. Video is sharp and clear with no interruptions.
B005HJ6MRO|1.0|I have this app on my android phone and it works perfectly. When installed on my Kindle Fire HD, all I get is a white screen. Uninstalled and reinstalled several times and still get a white screen. Anyone know a workaround?
B00B9366VO|5.0|Excellent movie all the way around. Gives you a really cool perspective on how larger musicians feel about their careers and love for music!
B002W1UEW4|2.0|The only thing to really recommend this movie, it that there are cool special effects.  Other than that, it was a bland action movie with characters that were equally as bland.  I expect to have fun watching action/adventure movies, this one left me kinda cold.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|this is a fun game but it is sort of slow to progress. also each run environment is very similar and seems repetitious. game is still addicting and you want to build your armorial up.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This is by far the best book I've read lately or ever. I enjoyed everything about it!! I will be reading it again.
B000FC1AGG|5.0|Emma is truly the everyday girl. It's such a good read ! I finished in just a few days ! If you want to literally laugh out loud , read this !
B009JZTOG8|5.0|This show and GRIMM are very similar.  It is a fantasy world brought to life with childrens bed time stories with a bit of a twist.  This show is one of my favorites.  I Love it!
B004MC8CA2|3.0|Since I do not have wireless all the time because of travel.  It is not always possible to read that version  that Amazon offers of the Bible.
B007BRJYF2|3.0|The graphics are really pretty, but it sure takes a while for my eyes to get used to the VERY small items I need to search for!!  It definitely is a marvelous game, but like I said, the items are small, and hidden. That just takes the fun out of it all.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|Music is very similar to the others which is great! The layout on how to get in the levels is very different but in a good way. I much prefer this way. Nine rooms to go into, four compartments inside of those and the compartments contain four puzzles each not including hidden levels.<br /><br />(There are 24 hidden levels containing time pieces. Look for the bronze loop holes for these levels. These time pieces or levels must be found much in the same way as the hidden jewels, by cracking stones. Speaking of which, there are 145 jewels to find.)<br /><br />I like the idea of how each room is unique and the different modes specific to the room name as I have found so far. Early in the game and already I have found myself stuck. Perhaps that is because of the new modes.  This actually lives up to its name!<br /><br />Collect the drops in room one, turn tiles to blue in room two, room three you break the ice and so forth. Not sure what is coming up yet.<br /><br />Cutscenes are good as well as they tell of the story of the man whose memories are mostly gone. Some puzzles also include a picture within them. Must dust it off as they also tell the story to be followed.<br /><br />The narrative is very good so far as well and looking forward to what's in store in Memento. Worth the extra buck.
B007ED9FIY|4.0|The first time you see this movie you are fascinated by the plot.  It is a really good one.  Lots of unexpected twists and turns.  I can also appreciate the way the main character handles the situation like an adult.
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|More mystery and horror ....great cast...Jessica Lange character is outstanding, as always.( only have watched only first episode ) can't wait to watch more episodes
B00BHU9BV6|2.0|I'll admit I have not read the book, that's why I wanted to watch the movie.  But the framework of this was a theater production.  Clever, but distracting.  This is a classic, for crying out loud.  You would think the makers could find a way to make a movie around a book that has withstood the test of time.  It was made even more disappointing because it was by the same people that brought us the beautiful cinematography of &#34;Pride and Prejudice.&#34;
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is better than temple run.SUPER AWSOME! get this game. more things to do....get hover boards more characters...AWSOME. collect mystery boxes coins items to unlock characters!!!!!!!!! GGGGEEETTTT GGGAAAMMMEEE AAWWSSOOMMEE
