B003PIUA18|5.0|This is another great performance by one of the best. There are several live performances by John Fogerty available; but, if like me, you grew up listening to CCR, you can never have too many by one of the all time greats. This one is a nice production, enjoy all the oldies and a few new ones.

B000GL1BHO|5.0|The color and detail of these Papo offerings is simply incredible; one would suspect that such detailed craftsmanship would cost much, much more!    I was totally blown away yesterday when I'd removed the three dinosaurs from the box ( T-Rex, Triceratops and Pteranodon).  Each replica has a substantial weight to it, and the texture and coloring actually have to be seen in person to fully understand what went into the making of these creatures.  If you're into dinosaurs, you'll love having these in your collection.
0316098337|5.0|This book is told through the eyes of Jack, a precocious 5-year-old boy. He's oddly smart for his age, because his mother has read him books and taught him mathematics. She's made sure he received plenty of nourishment and exercise to be a healthy child. The catch is, Jack has never been outside of the room, a room roughly the size of my studio apartment. He knows nothing of the outside world and has never interacted with anyone besides his mother. Through his eyes the room is almost a magical place, transformed by his mother into many different environments and full of creative activities. But as you read further you begin to realize that this is not the case. They are kept in this room by a man who kidnapped Jack's mother, and has been holding her against her will for seven years. Yes, do the math, but shhh Jack doesn't know, he's five. This book tackles many interesting issues about child development both psychological and physiological. Also, being loosely based on a true story makes you think about the people that have faced a similar imprisonment or are currently enduring one. This book will likewise hold you captive, you will not want to put it down.
B00000099Y|3.0|This is a good album, but some of the hype surrounding it really annoys me cuz I never more than liked this album. I like it, but i don't LOVE it like some people seem to. I'd still recommend it, but lower your expectations a little.

B004RLN3QG|5.0|This record is simply amazing.  Original sound, the best I have heard since S.R.V., but Joe's voice is silky smooth at times a lot like a deeper raspier version of Dire Straights.  Non the less, the Blues progression in this record simply out classes 99.9% of everything else out there.
0440539811|5.0|For those who are breaching sanity and reaching insanity  If you feel you've grown to the extent that you are now, because of the constant inner pursuit of truth or morality or justice etc.. And you've found that the truths you know now are far more complicated than the water down versions everyone to your left and right knows..If that has led you even deeper into the rabbit hole, transforming your very being. Then your on the right track and this book is a step. MAybe the first step, maybe the 5th step, maybe the last toward seeing the world as it is and not how its illustrated, or maybe this will tell you what you already know and fill you with tremendous excitement because others know what you know  and what you know is that noone knows anything beside what they know. Welcome to insanity. This book is hilarious and mirrors what is undoubtedly happening in your own head. Seek and you shall recieve muhahahahahhaha
B0000256VK|5.0|...is the only way I can describe this album!  It is so smooth, so fluid, so joyfully amazing that words cannot do it justice!  From the opening notes I am just soaring in the clouds over rivers and mountains...yet the words are so down-to-earth and at times downright melancholy, almost world-weary, you know this is truly a heartfelt album from artists that have been there and seen it all, yet retain that everlasting hope that true love can still be found among the wreckage of life's failed romances and never-fulfilled dreams, that there's still a chance that you'll meet that amazing, special someone and find your \\"seaside diamond\\" and \\"soon be home\\"...SOOOOOO different from the early Roxy and yet a logical evolution, the product of so many years of experience and learning and yearning...as with all later Roxy releases and Bryan Ferry's solo work, it is best listened to by candlelight with an attractive member of the opposite sex as a prelude to a night of pure romance...
159562015X|5.0|Easy to read.  Enjoyable.  Interesting.  You take an online test to find out your strengths.  Interesting to see the results.  The downfall is that the code to take the online test is a one time use only code.  So there is no retaking or getting someone else to take it.  After taking the test, you receive a summary by email that is pretty much a repeat of what the book tells you but focused on only your strengths.  I really liked this book and the test.  I recommend it.
B000ZELISO|3.0|This is my first Blu-ray Hp film. I ordered this movie because I wanted the DVD disc as the extra. Amazon shows this product as a Blu-ray/DVD combo pack, but i only received a 2-Disc Blu-ray version of the film. What's up with that?????
B004CEK0F0|4.0|I loved the first 3/4 of this book. It was quirky and well written and the characters were interesting and (mostly) relateable.  I did think the switching of 1st person/2d/3d person could get confusing at times and while it was sometimes fun to figure out where a story fit in the overall book time-wise, it got tiresome after a while. It would probably have been better to give us a date up-front in the chapter.  Still, I read this diligently, even when I got home from work (I usually only read during my subway commute)and my only real complaint is that it goes out like a lamb. The last few chapters, to me, were the weakest and the ending was rather unsatisfying.

B0038BBA4I|4.0|As much as I love their music, I can't help but think as a parent \\"would I want my kids listening to this?\\"  My two tween-er children agreed that we love \\"Little Lion Man\\", but we could do without the cursing.  To say \\"I really messed it up this time\\" would've sufficed.  We understand the intangible enticement of the \\"controversy\\", but really it is all about the music.   The mere fact that they recorded a version that did not include a curse word shows that they understand this.  I was around during the Two Live Crew's \\"me so horny\\" phase.  Their music doesn't live up to the controversy.  Prince could pull it off, most people can't. In the end, it is the music that stands up to history.  I think that Mumford & Sons are very talented, allbeit misguided.  Don't shock me, just play good music.  And don't say (sing) anything you wouldn't say to your own mother.
B0036EH3WK|5.0|With the conclusion of the greatest sci-fi drama, LOST, life has become meaningless for many Losties like myself, since the show's bittersweet ending.   It all began with Oceanic Flight 815 departing from Sydney to Los Angeles, a flight like any other; a plane full of strangers. But on route to its destination, something goes wrong. The flight crashes onto a mysterious island leaving only 48 surviving passengers. They're complete strangers, stranded on a faraway island, scared, and waiting for any sign of hope. But the only thing more mysterious than the people they are stranded with, is the island itself...along with the encounter with a polar bear in the jungle, the island natives called \\"The Others,\\" the hatch, the black smoke monster, the whispers heard in the forests, the \\"Numbers\\": 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42, the Dharma Initiative, the island's ability to move through time, the flashbacks, flash-forwards, flash-sideways into alternate realities, and too many other mind-boggling island mysteries.   One of the greatest and rare things about LOST is how it leaves you to question things like, let's say, how in the world a polar bear can appear in a jungle. But this happens to be the beauty of LOST, because it challenges you to question, \\"Well, how could that be? Or why is that?\\" leaving you to form your own ideas and hypothesize how these polar bears arrived at the island in the first place. But of course, LOST is not just about the polar bears. The show ties in these serious ideas of the human condition and struggle, what our purpose in life is, faith vs. science, free will vs. destiny, survival, redemption, and on a less serious note, how many times Hurley says the word \\"Dude\\" in LOST (which happens to be 328 times!) You can further look up how the mysteries on the island unfold along with the show's themes and character analyses as many other LOST nerds do, by checking out lostpedia.com, an encyclopedia site where fellow Losties unite to discuss the mythology of theshow, create theories, and dissect hidden codes that they discover in the week's episode.   It's incredibly difficult to find a show that is as captivating and challenging on a philosophical and scientific level as LOST is in entertainment media of today. As a proud LOST fan, I love seeing fellow hardcore Losties promoting the show. For example, I recently found out that 9,078 people played the famous LOST numbers 8, 15, 16, 23, 42 in the Mega Millions on January 5th and each won $150. Also Weezer's lead singer Rivers Cuomo found his inspiration for the band's newest album after Hugo \\"Hurley\\" Reyes from LOST which they decided to name \\"Hurley.\\" Cuomo stated that \\"No words are on the cover because all we wanted was his amazing face.\\" I do agree that Hurley's face is amazing, and I nod approvingly at Cuomo for honoring his amazing face in such an epic way.

B003UESJHO|4.0|\\"The Fighter\\" was  a project 4 years in the making that finally made it to the screen, in part, due to the persistence of actor and producer Mark Wahlberg. Wahlberg found a personal connection in this biographical story of Micky Ward, a working class boxer of Irish descent, the pride of Lowell, Massachusetts, who captured the WBU Light Welterweight title in a fight against Shea Neary in 2000.  Wahlberg and Ward were both from large Irish Catholic families in the Boston area; both had run-ins with the law; their fathers knew each other in prison. They even look alike. This role was tailor-made for Wahlberg, and, predictably, he is convincing.<br /><br />The film follows Micky Ward's (Mark Wahlberg) personal and professional life from 1993 to 2000, during which time his relationship with older brother Dicky Eklund (Christian Bale), former boxer and Micky's trainer, turned sour and then sweet again. Dicky was a crack addict whose mother Alice (Melissa Leo), the matriarch of her family of 11, spends a lot of time trying to keep Dicky in line and pretending that she's succeeding. Alice was determined that she knew what was best for her 9 children,  and she had her heart set on her boys being great boxers. Dicky, the greater natural talent, did not prove to have the discipline, but Micky would -if he could get out from under his family's sometimes corrosive influence.<br /><br />This seems like a decent boxing movie in my inexpert opinion, but it is as much about family dynamics. Alice and Dicky are strong characters who sometimes don't know what's good for themselves, much less what's best for Micky. Micky walked a fine line to stay in his family's graces, most of the time, and train in a way that would give him the best chance at success in boxing. As this is a forthright, foul-mouthed, tight-knit family, emotions and agendas tend to be on the surface, often erupting in a disruptive, abrupt manner. Christian Bale deserved his Academy Award for his physically demanding role of Dicky Eklund, a colorful man with a big personality and a very particular way of relating to people.<br /><br />Incidentally, \\"The Fighter\\" reminds me of the 1947 film \\"Body and Soul\\". That project came to fruition under the influence of actor John Garfield, who played the role of a boxing champ from a tough, ethnic, working class background. Garfield wanted to make a movie about the great Jewish boxer, triple division champion Barney Ross. But the Production Code would not permit it due to Ross' drug addiction. So Abraham Polonsky wrote a sanitized, fictional story of a boxer who turns to fighting after the death of his father. Garfield, like Mark Wahlberg, wanted to make and star in a movie about a boxer he admired and with whom he shared a common background.<br /><br />The DVD (Paramount 2011): There are 2 bonus features. \\"The Warrior's Code: Filming The Fighter\\" (30 min) interviews director David O. Russell, producers, cast, and the real Micky Ward and Dicky Eklund about how the film came to be made, Mark Wahlberg's 4 years of physical training, the challenges of portraying real people, shooting the fight scenes, and casting. There is an audio commentary by director David O. Russell in which he introduces us to the minor members of the cast, many of them from Lowell, provides additional information about the real people and what was changed for the film, talks about the acting styles, and offers his recollections of filming. Subtitles are available for the film in English, Spanish, and French.und, a colorful man with a big personality and a very particular way of relating to people.

B004E2XAFW|5.0|The wait has been worth it.  Within Temptation explode with a great new release that offers their fan base new dimensions of the band. One of the great things about WT is their ability to keep changing their sound and finding new directions in their music.  Some may say it is not Mother Earth or Silent Force but these are good things.  Their previous releases will always be a part of the band but they continue to evolve bringing their listeners more diversity of the band.  Sharon sounds great as always but her vocals take on a darker side on this release.  There are guitar solos in almost every song. No filler tracks are featured on The Unforgiving.  Every track on this record is outstanding including the 3 bonus tracks available on the download.      I purchased the special edition with the dvd (which is great) and then downloaded the 3 bonus tracks at .99 cents each.  One can only hope that the band will achieve more success in the US from this record.  I am thrilled to be a fan of a band that does not repeat their last record and continues to challenge it's listeners with new directions.  I truly believe that this is the best release from WT to date.  Check it out including the DVD where you get 4 music videos, the 3 short films, a prequel to the story and the Making of the record.  I cannot wait till they come to the States so I can experience this masterpiece live.

B0014I4KH6|5.0|Taylor Swift was 16 when she made this CD. A 16 year old that can make this kind of work is very talented. Her singing is beautiful in it. You can defiently see that she's grown in music when you listen to her new CD, Speak Now. She defiently put a lot of thought into this album when she made it. It's not as good as Speak Now but for her first album it's amazing. I would recommend this too anyone! Boy or girl! Her songs are just so catchy! Guys can't really relate to her songs, but because of how well she puts her songs anyone should be able to enjoy it.   Enjoy the CD! :)
B003L77GVK|5.0|I have watched and in fact own every episode of stargate (SG-1 and SG-Atlantis) and have truly loved watching them multiple-times so as you may figure I was very much looking forward to many seasons of SG-U. Unfortunately somebody with a calculator and pencil in hand and completely void in imagination or without the knowledge of what great entertainment is has decided to KILL it before it's time. The story and characters are outstanding as usual but with a surprising depth and realism that easily captures your attention and imagination. You find yourself rooting for some and booing others. The special effects are outstanding. My friends and I enjoy debating as to how the story will unfold. The writers must take a bow for their talent to surprise us with new direction and attitude. The acting is of award winning quality every week. Two seasons of SG-U is better than none but ALL of us in STARGATE LAND wish they would reconsider.
0060936223|1.0|Let's see.  What would you find more interesting?<br /><br />Choice 1:  You're living with a guy, really the love of your life, and he decides that in order to make a buck or two he should hustle men for money.  Then, after that you continue to share a loft--you on one side with your male lover and him on his side with his male lover.  Then, you get involved with a second guy who hustles men for money.  Do you think it would be kind of interesting to figure out where you were at with these kind of relationships?<br /><br />Choice 2:  Patti goes on a field trip to Paris and goes to the Rimbaud Museum.  But it's closed the day she gets there.<br /><br />Most people would find Choice 1 more interesting than Choice 2.  Not Patti.<br /><br />This is possibly the most overrated book of this or any other year.  News flash Patti:  Your aren't Van Gogh.  You aren't Picasso.  You aren't even close to Mapplethorpe.<br /><br />What this book proves beyond any reasonable doubt is that Patti was the Linda Eastman to Robert Mapplethorpe's McCartney--except Linda's tambourine on Band on the Run holds up better over time than does Patti's self indulgent \\"Horses\\".<br /><br />Mapplethorpe's art on the other hand truly does hold up beautifully 25 years after his death....<br /><br />This should be classified as \\"romantic fiction\\" to the extent that anybody would find her poetry fresh or original or the arrogance as an artist.

0739376969|5.0|I generally don't like business books.  I find them either overly complex or too simplistic.  This one is different... it's not a business book as much as it's a \\"life\\" book.  I use the insights I gained every day.

B004J4WQ46|5.0|I made the error of reading some of the music press about this release before I had a chance to actually hear it.  You can only too easily be duped into thinking that what matters is how long it's been since the last CD dropped, or how the tracks were recorded, or how happy the band members were with the process, or any number of things besides what it sounds like when you press play.    Another pitfall of reviewing a disc like this is that in the rush to broadcast your opinions as soon as possible, you can discount music that perhaps takes time to grow on you.    Case in point: a lot of reviews of ANGLES have suggested that the first half of the CD is much stronger than the second.  I would likely have agreed ten days ago, when I first spun the thing.  But then certain tracks start to grow on me...    Now that I've spent some time with the music, I think that ANGLES is another Strokes masterpiece, and certainly their best collection since IS THIS IT?    \\"Machu Picchu\\" and \\"Under Cover of Darkness\\" begin the CD with the best Strokes guitar work ever put on disc.  The tracks are heavy, infectious, power pop masterpieces.  The collection then moves into the deceptively softer \\"Two Kinds of Happiness,\\" which soars into a breakneck pace at the chorus.  The track is poppier, more cheerful, more optimistic than anything the band's done.  Which sets up the next track, \\"You're So Right,\\" beautifully.  It's dark, ominous, with Casablancas singing in an automaton monotone.  Again, the guitar work is stunning.  The fifth track, \\"Taken for a Fool,\\" then combines the pop feel with the malevolent undertones in a track that sounds like the best Television/Tom Verlaine song never released.  So yeah, the first half of the CD is perfect.    But \\"Games,\\" the next track, is hardly a letdown.  It's built around a cool bass groove, and the track sounds like the Strokes doing a kind of plaintive Peter Gabriel soul.  Very tasty.  \\"Call Me Back\\" is gorgeous, an orchestral chime of guitars built around a lovely melody, with some of Casablancas' most soulful singing.  A departure and a gem.  \\"Gratisfaction\\" is a funny thing, impossibly catchy, but it sounds like it would fit in the Big Star/Badfinger seventies more than the present.  Now I like Big Star, personally, but this one track doesn't work at the same level for me as the others.      The collection returns to perfection with the final two tracks, \\"Metabolism,\\" an amazing rocker, and \\"Life is Simple in the Moonlight.\\"  The latter is another deceptive track--you find yourself surprised how heavy it gets.  The band here really captures that Pixies/Nirvana sound dynamic of moving effortlessly between wall-thumping rapid fire noise and gentle, lyrical melody.      A disc like IS THIS IT? is unassailable because it doesn't have a single track that isn't simply perfect, but anyone who can hear will notice that the Strokes are just far better musicians today than they were a decade ago.  This new collection has subtle delights that keep emerging with each listen.  I get that it's cool to slag on the band now, but I seriously doubt there's any collection of songs or any group of musicians in 2011 that can touch ANGLES for sheer tunefulness and virtuosity.

B002BU0DPE|5.0|The Ear Force PX21 I purchased about 2 years ago lost the right audio channel. Since I really liked the Turtle Beach headset on the PS3 I decided to by another one just like it. After receiving the new PX21 there were several differences that I didn't appreciate.     First the headphone construction is cheaper than my older model. The older model had a more rugged construction on the band between the ear phones. The newer model is cheaper molded plastic.    The second thing was the quality of the audio sound. The older model had great control over volume and the audio clarity and separation was much better. The new model's earphones make you feel like you're are in a cave. The left/right separation is mushy and sounds more like mono instead of stereo.    The reason to buy a headset is to get away from a Bluetooth single ear configuration. In games where it matters, stereo lets you discern the direction sounds are coming from. The newer PX21 is better than Bluetooth, but not $50 better.

B00006CXSS|4.0|This DVD does have Closed Captioning, but if you view it through an HDMI cable the Closed Captioning is not available.  The HDMI cable connects the DVD player to the TV. To view the Closed Captioning you must send the signal though a standard cable.  The standard cable has the Red, Yellow and White RCA plugs on the ends. Make sure you have a standard cable connection between the DVD player and your TV. On the Input options on the TV, select \\"Video\\" and not HDMI.  The picture will be a little less sharp, but the Closed Captioning will be visible.  On my SONY Blu-Ray DVD player you must only use the Pause button to stop and start the video.  If you press \\"Play\\" the Input selector reverts back to the HDMI connection and you lose the Closed Captioning.  If this happens just change the Input selection on the TV remote back to Video. Good luck!  The Closed Captioning really does add to the viewing experience.

B0042MEQVG|3.0|Everybody has their own list of Crappy Movies You Can't Help Watching and the Twilight movies have a prominent place on mine.  With a few exceptions, notably Billy Burke as Charlie Swan, the acting is from hunger, the storyline improbable (vampires are improbable enough, but sparkly vampires?  Who'da thunk it?), and character development is practically non-existent.  But the movies do have a certain silly charm, especially Robert Pattinson's self-deprecating performance as Edward Cullen (and my God, he is so gorgeous he should have his own pin-up calendar), and Ashley Greene as his ditzy sister.  I can't help liking her.  Kristin Stewart was just plain irritating in the first two films but she's improved a lot in this movie.  Maybe she's finally learning.<br /><br />\\"Eclipse\\" is starting to grow on me.  The first time I watched it I couldn't stand it.  Then last night I saw it again on cable TV and actually enjoyed it in spots.  Maybe I wasn't in the right mood when I saw it the first time, but I love a good romance and the romance between Edward and Bella is really touching and sweet.  Especially Edward's explanation of why he insists on no sex before marriage: he wants to re-live the old-fashioned way of courtship he was cheated of when he was made a vampire.  I also thought the Cullens had more depth and dimension than they did in the other movies.  They aren't just a happy family, they're a close-knit family whose very existence is threatened by some newbies who don't know how to act right.<br /><br />Jacob, however... my God, I wanted to slap that boy upside the head.  Not that I didn't enjoy Taylor Lautner's performance, which I thought was the best of the three leads, but good lord, what is it with this guy that he can't take no for an answer?  Buy a vowel, get a clue, she wants Edward, she doesn't want you.  His obsession with Bella isn't romantic, it's irritating and immature.  She tells him she doesn't reciprocate his feelings for her; he tells her he's not buying it.  What isn't he buying?  He might as well throw a tantrum and tell her never mind how you feel, it's all about me.  He may be in love but he's got the emotional maturity of an eight year old.  And his justification of imprinting is chilling.  What girl wouldn't want a guy who imprinted on her?  A girl who likes to make up her own mind, that's who.  Actually, Meyer's big \\"triangle\\" is no triangle at all; it's two people in love and a third who won't take the hint that there's no room for him.  Jacob has some major growing up to do.<br /><br />The backstories of Jasper and Rosalie don't add anything to the film except to take up time, and the intrusion of the evil Volturi toward the movie's end seems more like an afterthought tacked onto the story, but taken as a whole, \\"Eclipse\\" isn't a bad addition to the \\"Twilight\\" series.

B0033AGPFS|5.0|Jimi's last studio album is stunning, and the sound quality of the vinyl is unbelievable. Everything on it sounds fantastic. The 2 Vinyl discs come in a nice gatefold jacket with plastic inner sleeves and an album-sized leaflet with photos, showing te letters Jimi wrote describing how he wanted the cover to look. He made it very clear, so it's kind of annoying they didn't use the photo he wanted for the cover. Also includes his \\"Letter to the Room Full of Mirrors\\", which is trippy and amazing. An awesome record.
B001VT1HCO|5.0|I still can't get over how good this album is.  The emotions in the album run deep, but on many repeated plays I find they are dusted with a twisted humor that is deeply satisfying.
B0025KVLT2|5.0|Someone said this album was substance abuse free-I think John called it the \\"pot album\\". Chemically fueled or not, this is one for the ages. When rock dies and morphs into techno cyber borg algorithms, this one will stand as a testament to what it was at it's best. The weakest tracks on the record compare to the strongest tracks on lesser artists' albums. It is testament of the artistic maturity of the group that there are almost no tracks that don't qualify as classic. The decline of the Beatles is a hidden subtext in every song, but that is inevitable when that when you peak, the fall off is already present. The fall off began to manifest at Sgt. Pepper and bloom majestically with the White album. Here though, they are riding the crest of a wave of artistic fruition as songwriters, as players and as a cohesive unit. If for some reason you have not heard or have this record, don't hesitate for a second-unless you don't like rock and roll.By the way, another reviewer said Ringo is not that impressive. Ringo and Charlie Watts are the two most underrated drummers in rock, although Ringo is finally getting his due as probably the most tasteful and heavy groove master drummer in the music. His fills and approach, as sparse as they are, have been consistently imitated from Bonham to Chad Smith in one way or the other. He does not have the chops of some of the tech-meisters out there today, but he can outplay almost any of them.One reason the band was so good, is that they had a world class rhythm section in McCartney and Starr.

B004QYZATW|4.0|This film, which has sadly not received overall, good reviews is delightful. If you need a film to make your day, this is it.  The  scenes of Venice are beautiful, Johnny Depp does a good job, Angelina Jolie handles the role of the attractive female and the story is an enjoyable puzzle. You will find that the few dollars that you will spend to rent this film is money well spent.
B0029QRA1U|5.0|Works great and is a bargain for the price.  I'm using this with a Mac and the software is super easy and imports your music right into iTunes.  I also connected it to my home stereo through the standard RCA jacks.  I remember in the past it was always a headache digging out an ancient receiver with a phono input so you could play a turntable through it but this one connects through any standard audio input that you will find on any receiver or audio system.  It's true what they say that nothing sounds better than vinyl.  Neil Young sounds great on this.

B003Y5H54W|3.0|This story has been told over a million times in different languages and countries. Disney even had a crack at it as well. I don't have to tell you what the story is about eveyone knows it already. Red riding hood is sexier in this film and seems to try to capitalize on the \\"Twilight Films\\", they are trying to reach the teenage audience. This is nothing more than an attempt to cash in on an old story. If your looking for originality don't look here. If you are looking for a film to escape that is what this film is. The effects are great and the wolf looks really good. If you want to see a different version of Red riding hood then give this film a try. It isn't that bad, I only gave it a 3 star rating because the story has been played out. The movie itself is pretty entertaining.
1439102813|4.0|When my new book club made this selection I had my doubts.  Not only did the subject matter sound depressing, but it struck a little too close to home having been down the Alzheimers road with a loved one myself.  Not sure I wanted to revisit those memories in my leisure time.  What I found, however, was a well told and poignant story told from the inside of this disease.  There was much to admire not only about Alice, but about those around her.  This story offered a level of insight and understanding I wish I had when dealing with my family.  There were a few moments which drew tears, but this book was in no way the depressing saga I had feared.  A good read that will stay with you.
B004GYY714|5.0|runs perfectly on my thunderbolt. love the interface.  think you.  very smooth. loads quickly.... well everything does on thunderbolt.  wonderful experience. much better than my iPhone radio app. I am happy I switched.

0807014273|5.0|What a fantastic book. The personal struggle to find moral virtue in a world stripped to the essence of it humanity. This is coupled with a discussion on how all of us might change our views through the practice of logotherapy. A wonderful combination of scholarly discourse and personal triumph that will ring true in our lives.
0756404738|4.0|The Wise Man's Fear continues the story of Kvothe in intriguing fashion.  There is action in the book but the point is not the action.  Getting to know Kvothe and learning more about how the seeds of his legend are born is.  If you are looking for dazzling adventures and world breaking spells, this might not be the book for you.     Read patiently and enjoy the trip.
B000JIJPZY|5.0|My sons favorite toy to this day, he's now 5 months old, is the Kitty that hangs from this playmat! It makes the cutest noise when the ball turns and is black and white, so I believe he really loves the high contrast.    Sometimes he plays with it for 10 minutes, sometimes he plays with it for over an hour. Just the few times he's played with it for that long makes it well worth it :D
B00005ONMP|5.0|I've been a fan of Mendelssohn's music most of my life; this set includes many selections that have had honored places in my collection and some that were entirely new to me. I have to admit that the first and second symphonies were the big draw when I saw this set on Amazon.<br /><br />I had never heard either of those symphonies before so I listened to them first and was very pleased with both of them. Symphony no. 1 in C minor was composed when Mendelssohn was only 15 years old, and although this was his first symphony for full orchestra it actually followed 12 symphonies for string orchestra which he had composed between the ages of 12 and 14. I never cease to be amazed it his remarkable talent.<br /><br />Also included is the orchestrated version of the Scherzo in G minor from the Octet which Mendelssohn inserted as a replacement for the third movement, Minuet and Trio, at a concert in 1829.<br /><br />Symphony no. 2 in B flat major was also completely new to me; it is a rather lengthy work, 74+ minutes, intended to be performed without interruption. This work is more complicated and deserves repeated hearings before evaluation. My initial impression was interest and a desire to give it another hearing very soon.<br /><br />Symphonies 3, 4, and 5 are well performed and bring interesting insights into these very familiar works. It is always interesting how different conductors can bring out new ideas from familiar compositions. Generally Abbado keeps things moving at a brisk clip which gives the music a sparkle.<br /><br />The overture were a mixture of new and familiar which was another reason I wanted this set; some of them I had never heard before.<br /><br />From an audio perspective the recordings are all completely satisfactory, the dynamics and the soundstage are both well done and enjoyable. I recommend this set especially in light of the very low price for so much music.
0385523912|5.0|I have always been curious about North Korea and what life is like for people who live under one of the most repressive regimes in the world. I knew of the famine and economic collapse through news reports, but it became much more real to me when I read the individual stories of these North Korean people and their families who lived through it all. This is a wonderful book to read if you want a window into what North Korea has been like under the failure of Communism.
B004S5D3B6|4.0|i was surprised to see the rating on amazon was 3.5 stars, i think it deserves at least 4.  i'm not too in to boxing but this movie kept me entertained every moment.  it was worth the $3 to rent.
B004EQAVHI|4.0|This movie brings up many philosophical questions about life, death, love, and what it means to be human.  It leaves itself open to many interpretations, and will leave you thinking about the larger meanings and messages long after the film is ended.    ****ALERT - MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!!!****    First off, I think one main message of the film is about how certain forgotten classes of people are used and tossed aside by the rest of us, to make our lives more luxurious or comfortable.  The only way we can manage to live with the knowledge that we are profiting off this exploitation, is to pretend these people don't exist.  We know there is child labor, and sweatshops, and that many of our clothes/sneakers/electronics are made in 3rd-world factories in borderline slave conditions, often by children who have no hope for a better life.  But we push this inconvenient truth out of our minds in order to enjoy the luxuries these forgotten people make possible.  It was interesting that in the film, almost every \\"regular\\" person who came in contact with the schoolchildren (deliverymen, maintenance workers, etc.), seemed very uncomfortable around them and wanted to avoid interaction with them.  They did not want to be reminded of the cost innocent people are paying for their longevity.    I also found it interesting that you almost never saw the beneficiaries of the Donor's sacrifice.  They lived in an alternate universe where the organs they needed just appeared - the messiness and horror of the process was hidden from them.  One very brief but telling scene is when the children were all in a restaurant laughing loudly, and an older couple at a nearby table looks at them with disgust and annoyance.  These are the very same people who will likely live a long life thanks to the ultimate sacrifice of the \\"annoying\\" young people.    I also found the issue of the \\"Deferrals\\" to be full of philosophical significance.  In essence I think Ishiguro is making a comment about death, andhow we all bargain for more time with the ones we love.  Interestingly, in the film the deferrals turn out to be nothing but a false rumor, a children's fairytale.  I think perhaps the author is making a comment on belief in the afterlife... we all want to believe that death is not the end, that we will see our loved ones in the afterlife.  After all, if our love is true enough, justice MUST dictate that we get more time with them.  Is there any basis in truth to this belief?  Or, are we like the kids at Hailsham - desperately believing a made-up story?    Of course, the film makes it clear from the very 1st scene that deferrals are false - we see Tommy clearly about to reach \\"completion\\" even as the opening credits roll, so we know there will be no happy ending for he and Kathy.  So the viewer is not surprised by the revelation late in the film that there are no deferrals.  What is touching, however, is the childlike hope with which Tommy and Kathy cling to this dream of more time together.  One of the most moving parts of the film is when we realize that Kathy, always the more grounded one, has just realized there are no deferrals - even as Tommy still clings to his hope.  Carey Mulligan does wonders with the smallest of expressions in this scene.     Also on the subject of the afterlife, in the final scene when Kathy looks across the field, she imagines seeing Tommy running across to her.  This is clearly a reference to the standard Hollywood version of two lovers reuniting in the afterlife.  We've seen this type of \\"happy ending\\" so often in movies, that we almost expect to see him come running over the horizon.  But tellingly, he never does - and Kathy never even allows the fantasy to progress to the point where they actually embrace.  The thought of something that she knows will never happen is too painful.  There is no more time.  There is no deferral.  All she will ever have is the brief time they had together.    So in the end I think this is a movie aboutlife - specifically, the blink-of-an-eye flash of time we all get on this earth.  Anyone who has been truly in love will know that no amount of years will ever be enough.  We all want a deferral, and would give almost anything for one.  In fact, the people in this fictional society in effect bargain their humanity away in exchange for their own deferrals - they allow innocent young people to suffer and die in exchange for their own \\"deferrals\\".  But in the end, deferral or not, \\"completion\\" comes for us all, and too soon. All we can do is appreciate every moment, and respect all of our fellow humans, and never let each other go.
B004SKHJF2|1.0|I was excited to see this app up from free from teh Amazon AppStore.  My excitement quickly turned to disappointment though as soon as I used the app.    I place my phone near a music source to try it out, and the app fired up, and thought about it.. ..and thought some more.. . and kept thinking.  The song ended, and it was still thinking about it.    Thinking this was a fluke, I tried again.  I killed the app, and re-started it (give it a fresh start), and played a different song.   The App thought it about for a second, then informed me that I had used up my monthly free allotment of song identifications, and that I'd have to pay a subscription fee to use it any more this month.  Huh?    So, does the app work?  I have no idea.  It did not for me.  And based on my experience, I would not pay a cent for a subscription to the service.  In fact, I will be removing this from my phone when I get a chance.
185984054X|5.0|My head just exploded.................Wow!  What were those biases keeping me from seeing reality once again?  How did I manage to keep Mother Teresa in a separate category from Falwell, Bakker, and Oral Roberts so long?  Was it it because she was a woman?  a Catholic?  What?!  I get the duality of human nature and still............Ouch!      Hitchens always backs up his work and does so once again.  As usual, his claims are evidence based and he uses the letters from Mother Teresa herself and a response from a Deputy District Attorney from Los Angeles, Paul Turley, to tell the story.  When Charles Keating was up for sentencing for his financial crime, Mother Teresa wrote a letter to Judge Ito asking for justice and mercy for this man who had stolen millions from others, and given quite a bit to her through the Missionaries of Charity. DDA Turley wrote to her asking what she thought Jesus would do in the given circumstances.   Turley suggested she could help Keating make reparation by returning the stolen money he had given her to the people from who Keating stole it.  She made no response and no transfer of funds.    On a second point, Hitchens stated in a recent interview that there is one known answer to poverty, one and only one solution that has worked wherever and whenever it has been tried, in a variety of different cultures and circumstances.  That solution is addressing issues of women's health and reproductive rights.  Mother Teresa has throughout her life, preached against women's rights to use birth control.  These are only two of the points Hitchens makes in The Missionary Position.    Read it and weep.

B0001HAHXW|5.0|Rather than write a whole big review on how great a player Mr. Clapton is etc I'm going to make this as brief as possible.We all know Mr. Clapton is one of the greatest all around guitar players ever to touch a fret board.This is a given. We all know that he and many other early '60 & '70 guitar players honed their craft on copying the early Delta blues men. This CD is Mr. Clapton interpreting some of Mr. Johnson's songs. Nothing more and nothing less.I was reluctant to buy it after reading a couple of the reviews. Not sure what passion is lacking in Mr.Clapton's playing on this CD. What I hear is Mr. Clapton playing Mr. Johnson and doing a damn great job. Glad I bought the CD.If I gets damaged I will repurchase it.If I want to hear Mr. Johnson play Mr. Johnson I'll pop in his CD that I have.For now I'm listening to Eric.

031261246X|4.0|The idea that the next major terrorist strike on the U.S. will come in the form of a cyber attack is not an implausible one. And Microsoft Technical Fellow Mark Russinovich holds the right credentials to infuse this doomsday thriller with a believable scientific core. His detailed discussions of rootkits, encryption, and the finer points of virus troubleshooting may not be for everyone, but the quick, staccato pacing of the plot keeps the pages flipping in spite of the scientific content.<br /><br />In fact, my biggest problem with the novel is that the constant flitting between characters and viewpoints renders the narrative too scattered and makes it hard to forge a close connection with the characters. The dialogue and overall writing style is also kind of clunky in places, as is often the case when scientists turn their hand to fiction. That said, Zero Game qualifies as a timely, competent suspense thriller, laced with frightening examples of how a sophisticated computer virus attack perpetrated by a small group of limited resources can cause calamitous results for our airlines, nuclear reactors, hospitals, factories, banks and other fundamental institutions comprising our economy.<br /><br />-Kevin Joseph, author of The Champion Maker

Other people here have written synopsis, so I'm not going to bother.  I just have to weigh in with the hundreds of other readers who gave this book 5 stars.  If there was a way to give it a higher rating, I would.  I loved everything about the book, the plot, the characters, the idea. . . it kept me up all night because I couldn't stop reading.  Now on to the second book.  You can bet I'm not waiting to start that one.

B004E2XAFW|3.0|Well im surprised to see all the 5 star reviews for this album, but maybe im the only one completely disappointed by it.  Sharons voice is still amazing but the album seems to lack almost all of the old symphonic metal style that they were/are known for.  Based solely on previous Within Temptation albums, this one I would have to rate as their worst.  Its not what I have come to expect from them.       With that being said the album isnt horrible, just dont go into expecting to hear metal.  For a pop/rock album its a good album.

0316069884|5.0|A must read!   Every human being should know where the food you eat comes from, it's common sense isn't it? Would you pick up a piece of chewing gum off the floor and eat it? It may sound far-fetched but that's exactly what we do when we buy products from the market and completely ignore the process of how it got there. Know the truth!  I urge anybody to read this, it may not change your opinion but knowing the truth is so much better than being ignorant about something so important.

B000LXHK2C|4.0|Loved this film! Although a tad long, this movie always brightens  my day and I think of scenes long after the film is over.  The critics seemed to pick this apart, but I don't agree at all.  It had charm, humor and lovely performances. I thought Russell Crowe did a great job at the warm and tender moments in the film.  An enjoyable book brought to life as an enjoyable film.
B003FVI2KQ|5.0|Had an AMD Athlon x2. Adobe Creative Suite needed at least a dual core. I needed more since  After effects is all about rendering when you are creating videos effects. Photoshop and Illustrator also use a lot in huge files as well with AutoCad. Thought I build my own PC and see where it takes me. Im really surprised how this Processor handles all my work while im Freelancing. I can finish my work faster! Thanks AMD. People who give bad ratings in this Processor is prolly due to that they dont know how to build a PC. No worries. Loving AMD right now!

0345404475|5.0|Perhaps Philip K Dick's best known novel is Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? It was the basis for the 1982 film Blade Runner. It takes place in the year 2021, in a U.S. that has been devastated by war and mass extinctions. People have begun to covet every living creature (owning real pets has become an extreme luxury). There are people who make electric animals for those who can't afford real ones, though there is stigma attached. They can also make humans. The novel follows Rick Deckard, a bounty hunter who job is to find and destroy (retire) rogue androids, known as replicants.<br /><br />The world Philip K. Dick has created is a dark and vivid one. I personally imagine it to always be raining or the streets to at least always be wet. This is probably an influence from the slow, but ultimately cult classic Blade Runner. Dick is able to create mysterious characters and set the scene faster and more effectively than any writer I know. There's something to be said about a novel written in 1968 that foresees so many things. He was certainly ahead of his time (or maybe dropped by aliens...)<br /><br />The relationship developed between Rick and Pris is not sexy or really something that is lusty, it just is. There's an extra dynamic in the story, where the reader is made to be unsure of who is a replicant and who is not. It makes sense, then, that any relationship that forms in the book seems artificial in nature. Even Rick's marriage to Iran seemed contrived. It was a wonderful job by Philip K. Dick to create an atmosphere of uncertainty around each character.<br /><br />I recommend this book to hard scifi fans and to fans of scifi films. There have been recent talks of sequel or prequel movies, which I'm not too sure about, but am willing to give a shot. Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep is a classic, and if you're just getting into the science fiction or even near future genres, I would recommend this as a great start to your adventure.<br /><br />Bookophile Rating: 95%

B002HR1W1K|5.0|To put it simply, Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg are comedic geniuses. Words cannot express the profundity of and breadth of their prowess. Hot Fuzz is a buddy cop action/comedy but doesn't slap you in the face with blatant, tactless humor as so many of its predecessors. All of Wright's movies are meant to be watched repeatedly so you can catch ALL the times he re-uses lines that were used previously in a different context. It's brilliant.    Ps: The soundtrack is amazing as well, but did you really expect less? If you're looking for an orgasmic soundtrack with hilarity and geeky, college-age awkwardness, hit up Scot Pilgrim vs. the World next. It'll blow you away.
B00425S1H8|5.0|I bought this instead of the cheaper units because of the excellent reviews on Amazon and I wasn't disappointed. Very easy to install and works flawlessly with my antique wind-up GPS and steam-powered laptop.

B003YFIUW8|2.0|While this was a quick read, I found it to be rather unbelievable.  The author created a female character that was supposedly smart and instinctive, but we are supposed to believe that she would fall for the 'I lost my dog' trick?!  And I had a VERY hard time believing the escape.  A man who has gone to such measures as to line the ground below Room with wire fencing would not check the body for life?  You have got to be kidding me.  The other characters were unbelievable as well.  The only person that I felt had any life was Steppa.  So, in short, I found this to be an irritating novel.
B002NX0LOC|5.0|Love this album.  The songs do not sound the same (like many albums).  Also many songs start of very different than how they end.  I love this album from Biffy Clyro.  They are excellent in concert as well.  A great band from Scotland and worth listening to.
0064407667|5.0|I really cannot understand why people dont like this book. They think its too dark? Its called \\"A series of unfortunate events\\" it's supposed to be dark. And it actually has a better plotline than alot of popular books out there, for example, Percy Jackson, ugh, that series is so freaking terrible that it made some people betray there religion and become a fairytale greek god worshipper. Thats just messed up. I dont think this book tops Harry Potter but its on Harry Potters level. Great Book.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I just bought two more of these headphones for my grandchildren, but not because they need the great sound.  The kids benefit from other attributes.  I have some terrific in-ear headphones that not only deliver the goods sound-wise but block other sound.  While that's perfect on the tractor, other times I want good sound with more ease and the ability to hear other things if necessary. The quality of sound these simple earphones deliver is astonishing.  It does, however, depend on how you position them. You have to have them in right way around, of course. I like to wear them hanging under my chin so they don't interfere with taking my glasses on and off which I do a lot and they're so lightweight they stay in place well.  It's quick off and on when necessary and they don't catch in my hair, but sometimes when I move my head down it moves the headpiece, which moves the earpieces and the sound isn't delivered as directly which makes a difference.  It encourages me to sit up straight :).  The sound is more consistent when wearing the headphones over your head as designed; it's just not necessary to wear them that way.<br /><br />For the kids, the headphones are replacing the earbuds that came with their little MP3 players.  We've found the ones that came with them are a bit too big for their ears and won't stay in place reliably.  After watching my granddaughter carrying her beloved little gadget around holding one bud up to an ear, I decided this type headset would be an improvement, and indeed it is. Since the headpiece is adjustable it works for her as well as for me.  She can still hear us when necessary, but can also enjoy her music without fussing with the headphones, which is great, especially in the car.  They work really well with the DVD player on trips since they don't take up much room in the case, are easy for the kids to put on and take off and are so lightweight they are comfortable.  They've already learned the trick of pulling one earpiece out so as to hear Mommy better and letting it easily reset into their ear when the message has been acknowledged.  This is so much easier than removing and resetting an earbud, I really value the ease as well.<br /><br />All that said, I love them for myself and although I carry earbuds with me, these are the headphones I use around the house.  The first time I used them I couldn't believe I could get sound that impressive out of such modest headphones.  I'd expect it from multi-hundred dollar headphones, but I think you'll find these are as good as the much bulkier noise canceling headphones.  I highly recommend giving them a try.  You might be as surprised as I was.Mommy better and letting it easily reset into their ear when the message has been acknowledged.

B00005HYHA|5.0|This mini-lp replica sleeve (mlps) version of Pink Floyd's \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" is a real treat for collectors and fans alike.  I also have the mofi gold disc version whose sound quality pales in comparison with this remaster.  I do however feel that the ultimate sound quality is still there to be had if the powers that be just agree for the sake of art and posterity to put aside their differences and to let Alan Parsons do a fresh new remix/remaster like he did with his own albums and EMI please get this done before he leaves this world for good!  It would be like wondering forever what a Director's cut version of \\"2001: A Space Oddessy\\" would have been like if Stanley Kubrick had been given the task before he died.  I think Alan Parsons should be given a chance with the new technology out there to do a \\"Producer's Cut\\" of the album for the benefit of posterity; not all albums deserve this treatment but surely one of the best ever does!<br /><br />As far as this mlps version goes, the sound quality is very good even when compared to the mofi gold disc that I have as the sound is crisper, clearer and much less muddy especially on the chorus of \\"Us And Them\\" which is a nightmare on the mofi version.  I was also able to hear detail like the soft spoken parts throughout and especially at the end that is virtually impossible to do on the mofi.  Being a guitarist myself and a big David Gilmour fan I was especially happy with the improved sound quality that gives his solos especially on \\"Money\\" a new lease of life sounding very fresh and vital.  Given the great work he does here I'm amazed that this track only credits Waters as composer as surely Gilmour deserves joint credit on this track.  Taking out his input would leave this track a pale shadow of what it has become here.<br /><br />This release also has a lot of nice extras like 2 foldout colour posters-one of the band and one of some pyramids, plus replicas of the original centre circles of the vinyls-both sides- a small rectangular sticker, a foldout with all the lyrics in both English and Japanese.  The mlps itself is designed with good quality thick cardboard although great care is needed when opening up the gatefold as it almost unavoidably leads to a permanenet white crease at the spine i.e. you will always know if you are getting a brand new or a used version this way.<br /><br />Great mlps design, great extras, great content and especially great sound quality make this an easy review.<br /><br />Highly recommended!ngular sticker, a foldout with all the lyrics in both English and Japanese.

B000V6583C|5.0|The album is fine. Most everyone has heard songs from this album, the only small thing is that if you put the songs into your MP3 player they will show up with the [explicit] which isn't bad since that way if you have kids you don't want hearing the bad words you can get the clean version but its just small thing, easily fixed.
B0018PH3L0|2.0|I was very pleased with the dvd when it arrived in good condition but I was unable to play it on my DVD player as it Stated \\"Wrong Region\\" presumably it is for use in USA only so what can I do to be able to see this long awaited DVD?

B004G600A4|5.0|I got this two days ago, and I just can't stop watching Tangled. Man I wish there's a sequel to this movie. This is also my new and favorite disney movie!

B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I loved this book! My only complaint is that it leaves off right in the middle of the story with no real resolution. This drives me crazy! Nonetheless, it is a fantastic story. It's a fresh and exciting blend of some favorites: the Twilight Saga, the DaVinci Code, Practical Magic, and a few others. A must read!
B0031XWL4G|3.0|my first born is 20 months old, and we have been reading this book to him almost everyday for the last 3 months in anticipation for his little brothers arrival, he understands a lot, but this book didn't help, 20 months is probably too young for him to understand.    personally i do not like its story, but thats up to the individual i guess     it's a well made and has nice pictures
B000VZD8TO|5.0|I read this book years ago for the first time. I had a near death experience as a child. I had flash backs and was trying to put the pieces together. Whether you believe in this sort of thing or not, I don't know. I just find it odd that a lot of people who have near death experiences also report similar things afterward. I told my parents about this when I was a child. I couldn't have made it up because I did not have any knowledge of such a thing. This is a really good book and I hope that what this woman says is true. Her story is similar to what I experienced, but more than I can remember. Who knows?
B004LUS390|2.0|The application has good features, but the app won't let me import pictures as a layer.  also the lines come our squiggly when I draw a straight line.
B0015DROBO|1.0|I love to read. Plain and simple, its my favorite thing to do. I can get a book start reading it and immediately get lost in it. However, with this book I was completely detached. I couldn't get into it so I ended up returning it. I don't know how its a best seller. I'm probably the only person who hates it.
B003Y5H50G|2.0|This is a drug film. It came across as a not even thinly veiled ode to the greatness of Methamphedamine (Speed) and/or Cocaine. Its compleatly unashamed in its message and it doesn't take one step back from it all the way to the end. The message is that drugs are great and that all the risks can be managed by a smart addict. All the scifi aspects of the film do is serve to exaggerate the real-world boost of drugs.     All the hallmarks are here. The world becomes brighter when the drug is taken. He goes and parties continuously for days. He can crank out work. He suddenly starts cleaning his apartment compulsively in the middle of the night. he forgets to eat. He does damage to his body. He has blackouts. His woman friend who was on the drug for a long time is now prematurely aged. We even get the guys drug dealer disguised as a high-interest loan shark. And you get large numbers of contemporaries dying. There is even all the addict paranoia about hiding and losing a pile of drugs. They also have him so in love with his drugs that he literally licks them off the floor.    And best of all, they use two professions in the film where drug use is rather common (wall street and writers).     But what the film gets wrong is that drugs don't make people smarter or teach them foreign languages instantly. They speed you up and give you limitless energy and make you more confident. You can get more done, but not because your smarter. But because you can work 2x to 3x longer.    Where the film falls down is in showing the long-term price. It didn't show his body wearing out. It didn't show the paranoia or the teeth falling out. It didn't show that as drug use goes on you get diminishing returns. You may be able to crank out pages in a book, but they cease to be good pages. They also miss the costs of not being able to properly sleep.     On the positive side, right up to the happy ending its probably one of the best films I can think of in capturing the deluded mentality of anew heavy drug addict. But its not generally a good message to be out pushing. And the film doesn't capture at all what happens in the long term.    The plans of the main character are fairly lame. He wants to get rich on wall street and the become president. Why? He has a plan to make everything better. And typical of drug logic, we never find out what that plan is. I also don't remember if we ever found out if he had or had not killed a woman during a blackout. But he clearly is involved in the murder of a lawyer for messing with his stash.    I could have lived with the film minus the happy ending. But ending it in the way they did made a pro-drug film.     Robert De Niro is in the film basically doing a character actor role as the big man on wall street. Its a completely workmanlike performance. His name on a film still sells tickets but you really wonder how many times can get away with it putting his name on something he has no personal investment in.     Somebody came up with a new continous zoom effect for the film. Its an interesting effect and it communicates well to the viewer the sense of being trapping at full speed thats at the heart of the film. Its maybe used a little too much and they pulled it out way too early. But it was a nice original touch.    The film is essentially told from the narrative point of view of the main character. Bradley Cooper pulls it off well. His girlfriend is basically a prop character.     Technically and in terms of acting, its a good film. But the script and its message are rather questionable.
B004RJMUJO|4.0|This game is simple, and a lot of fun. You don't need directions to use it; it's intuitive. I got it for free via Amazon free-app-of-the-day, but if I would have had to pay for it, I wouldn't have bothered. But I do like it. Give it a try.  HTC EVO 4G
0812550757|5.0|Could this sequel be better than the first? It just might be. I really enjoyed 'Ender's Game' but (IMO) 'Speaker for... \\" just may edge it out.  Obviously it's a moot question; but definitely read the book, it's worth your time.
B004EC5IUW|5.0|Before I go further let me answer the question, \\"Is this really worth buying if I own/love the original series?\\" The answer is YES! Absolutely yes.    I'm old enough to have seen the original series via bootleg VHS fansub (the good ole days) and while it had it's issues (depressing last quarter of the series, Shinji's bipolar personality etc) I can say this takes everything that was great (major plot points, characters, battles) and compresses the info, re-imagines it and tosses out the fluff and filler. Shinji is less annoying and more headstrong, the angles are more deadly and the action is animated so well it will make you wish all anime was up to this new level of quality.     The only thing that I didn't really like, and I never did, is the 'fan service' or \\"showing partially nude teenage kids to appease the teen boy fans\\" always has and will creep me out a little. Thankfully there is very little of it.    SPOILER: There are many plot changes, character arc differences and elimination of certain people and even events. That said the HD soundtrack and picture quality plus story make this a must have for fans of Eva or anime in general.    Highly Recommended.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|A V A T A R  Despues de ver el film en un cine 3D pensé que no era posible verlo en toda su magneficencia en un Home Cinema.  Pero no. Es sencillamente ESPECTACULAR.  Lo veo en un Plasma LG de 60\\" Full HD.  Amplificador ONKYO de 7.1 canales y 135 Watts RMS por canal.  Cinco parlantes CerwinVega con woofer de 15\\" y dos SubWoofer Paradigm.  Es algo que no se olvida.  La nitidez y definicion de las imágenes son apabullantes.  Todo lo que se diga es poco.  Especial es el inicio con que comienza la \\"Collector's Edition\\".

B004HEXSLI|5.0|Well written experiential account of a severe incident. It is reminiscent of Lila by Robert Pirsig in which he discusses viewing events from within the event rather than from a distance. The brain does not work as simply as we would like, but this is after all a first hand account. I have no idea of the clinical implications of the book but it is interesting.
B004G6009K|5.0|There are plenty of synopsis out there so I won't waste your time. Yes, this is a great movie. Yes, this has awesome 3D (one of the best yet). Most assuredly, this one is a keeper and I would recommend it.

B004P6EQE6|5.0|When it comes to many of the remastered recordings from the mid-to-late sixties, the words, \\"From The Original Mono Master Tapes\\" are music to my ears.  And, so they are written across the unique container encasing the 24K gold CD of the 1967 album, \\"Younger Than Yesterday\\" by The Byrds. These are The Byrds, Byrds - still the core (80%) of the original band apparently at the eve of their breaking apart.  But none of what must have been going-down between band members corrupted the music they produced on this recording as a group and individually. \\"Younger Than Yesterday\\" is a continuation of the folk-rock genre The Byrds, along with many of their southern California peers, were part of creating though filled with hints of the future creeping in via a couple of solid country-rock influenced tunes.  \\"So You Want To Be A Rock 'N' Roll Star\\" leads off the album and here's the first example of the rewards received through the pleasure of monoraul sound.  This is how I remember hearing the song on the AM radio; yes, FM and stereo broadcasts were beginning to program rock music across America, but that evolved over a long period while \\"the hits just kept on coming\\" out of the Top 40 format.   The record company, Audio Fidelity, brings out the magic of the mono on this release; that is, the sound is deep, full, rich and much broader than you may imagine when you consider mono compared to stereo.  I want to hear all the instruments, voices and harmonies smoothly blended as one big sound and this particular Byrds album perfectly lends itself to the warmth necessary to achieve this lofty goal without violating any sound limits that work against the intent of the true fidelity.  This is a refreshing listening experience and a welcomed break from all the stereo recordings and the separation of sounds that come with that process.  Of course, the band members went on to diverse musical careers, but that should not diminish the power of this record, especially in the context of itstime - on many different levels, this is one of the greatest and most influential rock records of all time and the clarity of sound produced on this specific release will delight you - and, I dare say, surprise you too, if you never had the pleasure of listening to the mono version. Go mano a mono, you'll be at one with the recording as never before.
B004DI7HZ6|2.0|Now I remember why I don't read romance novels anymore... this book bored the heck out of me.  I really don't enjoy all the details of the tea drinking, wine drinking, fixing meals, napping, bathing, and horseback riding.  After the umpteenth visit to the Oxford library where nothing actually happened, I just speed-read the last 2/3 of the book.  Guess what...  I didn't miss anything!  Because nothing really happens!  It's all just a set-up for sequels!      It would be different if this book had less talk and more action.  You could cut 1/3 of this book and still have it be too wordy.  But basically, all you get here is a witch slooooooooooowly discovering her powers, and falling in love with the typical handsome, brooding vampire.  He's all \\"grrrr... get away from her, she's mine!\\" and she's all \\"I can take care of myself, you gorgeous brooding vampire!\\"  This book fails at both being a good paranormal novel (nothing you haven't seen elsewhere in a more creative form) and a good romance novel (it's that whole destiny thing, so you don't actually feel any relationship building...  this book is heavy on pseudo-intellectualism and not so good with emotional connection).  The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is that the author is a pretty good writer.  She has a lot of potential if her editor grows a pair and tells her to quit going over the same relationship issues a hundred times and stop using every available cliche.    The genetic pseudo-science bothered me, too.  Either it's magic or it isn't.  Giving it a scientific basis (extra chromosomes!) is really ridiculous.  Unfortunately, that is a key concept in this book (and the obvious sequels).  So I won't be hanging around to see what happens next.    Don't believe the comparisons to Harry Potter, this book lacks imagination and is too tedious to be fun, too cliched to be gripping, too over-ambitious to be romantic.  I have no idea why other readers have rated this book so highly.
B004DK5CW4|5.0|I love horses and horse movies.  I thought this one was excellent.  I have watched it several times and have enjoyed it every time.  I also cry every time I watch it.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|This is by far one of the finest dog theme movies I have ever seen!  It makes Marley and Me look ridiculous...it makes Old Yeller look like a happy tale!  It was heart wrenching...no doubt, but it was well worth the tears.  Richard Gere's performance was outstanding, as were all the other supporting characters, including the wonderful dog who played Hatchi!  I can't recommend this enough for anyone who has a soft spot for their loyal pooch.  I know our dog is going to get extra attention tonight...!<br /><br />What meant even more in my eyes is that this is based on a true story.  To think that a dog could have that much loyalty to their master...it's heartbreaking and beautiful all at the same time.

He is about 23lbs and has no issues pulling up on the handle to assume the walking position.  Since we have limited walking space in our multi-level townhouse, this item is perfect.  I would definitely recommend it.

B004RLN3QG|5.0|Another great album by one of my heros. Joe Bonamassa.    1. Slow Train   This song is unique and powerful, but i believe there was some left magic left on the table in the introduction. I just really would have liked the song to explode after the train like intro. Otherwise i really like the verses and the vocals are top notch.    2. Dust Bowl  Awesome song...just unbelievable imagery, you feel like your heading downtown in a dustbowl town somewhere out west to find yourself a proper drink.     3. Tennesee Plates  Grew on me as I listened, The keys sound really good on this track with the legendary Vince Gill.     4. The Meaning of the BLues  Interesting song, i like the lyrics most of all, the meaning of the blues really is when you love a woman you cannot have.    5. Black Lung Heartache  My favorite track on the album. The heavy drop d guitar really rocks.    6. You better watch yourself  Love the blues melody and lyrics    7. The Last Matador of Bayonne.  A little slow for me, interesting lyrics tho    8. Heartbreaker  Great song...love the rythym, my makah must have been a heartbreakaaaa    9. No Love on the street  Great track, i like the vocal melody that Joe does here (there aint no LOOOOAHHVVEEE), unique for him. Almost Santana like guitar on this track.    10. The Whale that swallowed Jonah  I love the acoustic overlay, great track    11. Sweet Rowena  Ok, a little corny    12. Prisoner  Great lyrics...powerful way to close a stellar album out.

1595141979|5.0|I think this series is way overlooked especially after the popularity of the Twilight Series and past popularity of The Vampire Diaries books.  I've read both of those series, I think Vampire Academy is much more entertaining and the characters are much more likeable (honestly, didn't anyone else almost give up reading with all of Bella's whining???).      Ok ok, I don't want to slam Twilight... it was one of the books that got me into reading again after being burnt out with required reading for college.  I think anytime we can get young people to read it is a great thing!  However I have recommended this series to 4 friends and my mom.  We all put this series in our favorite lists, ahead of Twilight and Vampire Diaries.
B001OQCV6K|5.0|Sherlock Holmes is a bad man and this interpretation of him brings him into the 21st century.   The casting is spot on.  Especially Mark Strong as Lord Blackwood.  Excellent story and definitely worth a look.
B003L20IHE|5.0|Zac Efron has solidified himself as a leading man in Hollywood with his masterful portrayal of Charlie St. Cloud.  Without giving too much of the plot away, Efron absolutely shined throughout the film.  You felt every single bit of his angst, heartache, emptiness, and sadness.<br /><br />I never read the book, but I'd imagine this movie more than did it justice.  What a beautiful, heart warming film.  I can't say enough good things about it.

Margaret discovers that truth is stranger than fiction as she endeavors to write Vida's biography accurately.<br /><br />The Thirteenth Tale is like an overgrown English garden where both beauty and rot are discovered as you make your way through bramble-covered pathways. Setterfield does an amazing job of story-telling, keeping you guessing to the end.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book, especially if you enjoy books like [[ASIN:1456534831 Jane Eyre and Wuthering Heights]], [[ASIN:1439153663 The Kitchen House: A Novel]], [[ASIN:1416550550 The Forgotten Garden: A Novel]]or [[ASIN:0399155341 The Help]]

B000JQTWPO|5.0|The Moonstone by Wilkie Collins is usually credited as the first English-language detective novel. It features the theft of a valuable diamond, an heiress, an amateur sleuth, an English country house, a Scotland Yard detective, laudanam, quicksand, a backdrop of events in colonial India, a reenactment, and lots of red herrings.<br /><br />The plot is revealed using first person accounts from eleven different narrators. This device provides humour and contrast, and allows the reader to read between the lines and make deductions about what might have happened.<br /><br />The Moonstone was first published in serial form in 1888, in a magazine edited by Wilkie Collins's friend Charles Dickens, so there are plenty of hooks to keep the reader turning the pages. Despite being more than a hundred years old it's a fresh, exciting read and is now available free in the Kindle Store.

0060775858|5.0|We have read this book through four children, and are starting on the first grandchild.    I still haven't figured out why children stick to this story like glue, but even I never get tired of it, and believe me, I have read it over and over and over and over again.    Relax and read this aloud with a gentle rhythm, slowing down to match the pace of pre-bedtime relaxation. The rhymes are pleasant without being too obvious, and the subtle changes in the illustrated rooms are fun to look for -- specifically, where's the mouse?    The Toddler has already misplaced one copy, just from dragging it around throughout the house. Time to get another one.
1594202842|5.0|Amy Chua's \\"Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother\\" received so much press--that I fear many people made up their mind about it before ever reading it.  I didn't expect to enjoy it so much--or read it so quickly.  I thought I'd hate Amy, but actually liked her.  As a parent, I could relate to her struggles and her desires for her children (and even her dogs) to be the best.    Growing up, I went to an overpriced private school filled with many Asian kids.  They always excelled (yes, stereotypically--but true)--whereas my parents thought that school was hard enough, and never really taught me how to study or work hard.  Without much effort, I graduated cum laude and went to a top university where I did well again without much effort.  I remember seeing my Chinese-American friends studying at all hours and wondering why?  It wasn't until I was doing some post-bac science classes that I actually learned how to study from an Indian friend.  I went from A-s and B+s to solid As.  Wow, studying actually works.  I often wonder if I had parents who had pushed me even a little, what I could have achieved and when.  Not only in academics, but in the languages I studied, music, sports, etc.  I wish I had a work ethic taught to me at a young age.    While Chua changed her techniques with her youngest daughter, Lulu still knew she had benefited from her mother's pushing in the end.  She was applying the same tactics to her tennis--and as such, succeeded.  I suppose it supports the 10,000 hours to mastery theory.      My husband is Egyptian--and the parenting culture is very similar to the Chinese approach.  He feels I am way too Western.  I think/hope that a balanced approach will serve our kids well, but I have to admit--I will most likely defer to him should a conflict arise.  I wonder how much potential we as a nation lose because we are afraid to demand excellence?
0739321005|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed hearing President Obama in his own voice narrate his autobiography..... his story is candid...eye-opening and very revealing. Especially in light of the whole right wing \\"birther\\" controversy. A must hear for any one who is still on the fence with this issue... there is no doubt in my mind that President Obama is an American, born and bred in the United States of America.<br />His Experience is just like that of most Americans. An amazingly brilliant man with a great heart who was fortunate to be raised by a wonderful mom and grand parents.<br /><br />I am so proud to call him my President!!
B0019NB9A2|4.0|I've viewed this film in various formats since the 1960s.  The Blu-ray transfer is by far the best version.  I suspect it looks better than most of the prints that originally went through theaters in 1956.  They put a lot of effort into making this picture look great.      When I'm paying twice the price for a Blu-ray disk than I do for a DVD, I do it to get a better image.  And so often this is not the case.  But I definitely got my money's worth on Forbidden Planet.    As far as the movie itself goes, it's a clever premise and Walter Pidgeon knew how to act.  But the other actors are pretty stinko. And the screenwriting is just plain awful. However, it's worth seeing just for the analog special effects that had to have been the best put in any movie of the 1950 decade.  And with this excellent transfer the effort behind them really shows.    Besides, how can you possibly pass up watching 30-year old Leslie Nielson playing a straight romantic lead in high definition?!?!?
B0041KKYEM|3.0|Natalie Portman's Oscar-winning performance dominates this delirious psychodrama from director Darren Aronofsky. However, for all its visual bravura, \\"Black Swan\\" (2010) has little resonance. The predictable screenplay is derivative of superior films such as \\"The Red Shoes,\\" \\"All About Eve\\" and Aronofsky's own \\"The Wrestler.\\" A fine supporting cast (Vincent Cassel, Mila Kunis and Barbara Hershey) and Portman's intensity sustain your interest, yet this balletic nightmare remains decidedly overrated.
1400052181|5.0|The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks    This book is about a woman in the 1950s whose cells were taken (without her permission or her knowledge) by her oncology doctor at Johns Hopkins Hospital. The doctor did this with all of his patients in an effort to grow an immortal cell line; cells that would continue to grow in order to be used in testing. Henrietta's cells, known as all cell lines were, by the first two letters of the first and last name of the \\"donor,\\" HeLa cells did not just grow, they flourished, anywhere and in almost any condition. They were used to create vaccines, map genes, were sent into space and are still used by scientists around the world.    In my opinion, there was a good balance of science (nothing overly technical), Henrietta's life (There wasn't a whole lot, which some seemed to dislike, and part of it was shocking, particularly by today's standards; but how many poor, uneducated women in the 1950s had detailed records kept of their lives?) as well as what's become of her family since her death and the discovery of what happened to her cells and the impact they've had, and continue to have, on all of our lives. It also served as a mini history lesson on what life was like in the (really) suburban south for blacks in the early to mid-nineteenth century. Additionally, Skloot discusses the ethical and legal issues of our bodies and what rights we have, or don't have, when we give blood, tissue samples, etc. for any reason.     It's obvious that the author spent a lot of time and effort winning the Lacks family's trust, which they didn't make easy. At the same time, I can't blame Henrietta's family for being suspicious and hesitant about opening up to her. For the most part, they were poor and not well educated and once the identity of the HeLa cells' owner became public knowledge, many of the people who sought out the Lacks' had less than honorable reasons for doing so. Some of the family were resentful about the billions of dollars that havebeen made from their relative's cells, but who wouldn't be, especially when many of Henrietta's heirs couldn't even afford to see a doctor. In the end, though, it seems what they wanted most, in no small part due to Henrietta's daughter, Deborah, was recognition of their mother and her unintentional contribution to science. I just have to add that I was really impressed with Bobette (Henrietta's oldest son Lawrence's wife), and everything she did and tried to do for Henrietta's children. If it hadn't been for her, I'm sure things would've turned out even worse for them.    Even though she was put through the ringer, I'm very glad that Rebecca Skloot had the tenacity to not give up on this story. I liked her writing style and how she blended the story of HeLa, medical ethics and science into the story of a family who didn't get many breaks, and at times didn't make it any easier for themselves through their own actions. Despite it being obvious that she grew to care a lot about the Lacks family, Skloot's telling of their story was fair and didn't gloss over any of the bad stuff, of which there was, unfortunately, plenty. No matter what genre you usually read, I highly recommend this book.
B0041KKYEM|5.0|Swan Lake is one of my favorite ballets, so when they started running trailers for this movie, I knew I had to see it. I read the reviews so I was somewhat aware of what I was getting into when I went to see the movie. I wasn't a big fan of Portman before seeing this movie, but her roll in Black Swan allowed me to see a different side of her. Knowing the kind of rolls she usually portrays, this part was fitting yet a step outside of the norm as you watch her character begin to detach from reality and descend into insanity.     Barbara Hershey is the ballet mother from hell as she slowly loses her control over her once shy, demure and obedient daughter. Mila Kunis' roll is a free spirit who inadvertely aids Nina (Portman) in her spiral into insanity. Vincent Cassel plays the artistic director you want to hate as he encourages Nina to get in touch with her sexuality and lose herself. There is nothing but off the chart acting in this movie. Black Swan pitches back and forth between reality and madness, leaving one wondering what's real and what's not. And that's exactly where Nina is, as she taps into a side of her psyche to play the roll of her life: the White swan... and the Black swan; good versus evil. Innocence and purity versus temptation and seduction.
B00275EGX8|2.0|I did not watch the whole thing, which is unusual.  I found the characters irritatingly two dimensional.  The \\"hero\\" was just a tool who would not last 8 seconds in a real military organization.  Whilst it never claimed to present the insurgent side of the engagement, the fact that these people were presented as stereotypical \\"bad guys\\": did not do much to present a thought provoking or interesting movie.
B0012Z361C|5.0|Great dvd.  I can't stop watching it. Driving my family crazy. Love it and  the wonderful voice of Andrea Bocelli!!!!!
0670022411|3.0|I read this book, wondering how people have given it such rave reviews.  The reason I gave it 3 stars is that the story is barely interesting enough to finish.  However, the main word that comes to mind in reading this book is \\"juvenile.\\"  The way the characters act, their conversations, their relationships, the way the magic works, all of it makes you think that this is a book for a MUCH younger audience, but then the author mixes in a lot of sexual scenes, which means she didn't intend it to be for tweens, but it certainly reads that way.<br /><br />There is nothing really creative here.  The magic is all Harry Potterisque.  The vampire story has been told and retold (and never as well as Anne Rice did).  The only originality is that she puts the 2 together and frankly not very well.<br /><br />She intends to write 2 more follow up books.  I, for one, will not be reading either one.  One is enough for this life time....

B004DN3VEM|4.0|Honestly, I must say I prefer the original 1999 Remaster to the sound on this one. Two different mixes of the albums, New York and Los Angeles, but as one reviewer pointed out, neither one seems to get it right (although the bass is definately mroe audible on the LA mix). This is just my opinion, some people may enjoy the different mixes of the album, but I really think that both of these new remasters are not quite as good as the 1999 version; the new remaster sounds more tinny, thinner, at least to me.     However, the rough mixes ARE interesting, though the sound quality is not too great. It's cool to hear the band without any effects and whatnot, and there is on this (disc 2) a different opening passage to Stargazer, in which it begins with a keyboard lead, a la Tarot Woman. That was pretty cool!     So, if you're a diehard rainbow fanatic, and you want the alternate mixes of the orignal album along with some neat \\"raw\\" mixes, then I recommend this to you. BUT, don't throw out your old CD right away when you place the order, keep it and compare for yourself which remaster you prefer, 1999 or 2011, because you never know, you might prefer the older disc like I do.     If you have not heard this album before and are looking into it for the first time, I suggest you get the original remastered edition, because this edition really is more for diehard fans only, and with the original CD you save about 12 dollars. Anyhow, the album in general is highly recommended, very good stuff!

B0041KKYBA|5.0|This documentary is well made and its analysis of why we got into this financial mess is on target.<br /><br />Basically, our version of capitalism, which strongly emphasizes self-interest rather than the common good, is vulnerable to exploitation by those in positions of greater wealth and power (primarily by corruption of the political process), thus fostering a winner-take-all effect in which the rich get richer and everyone else stagnates or regresses.<br /><br />A cultural shift towards social democracy could help remedy this situation, but that doesn't seem to be in the cards for  the foreseeable future, and I fear that we may be trapped in a vicious cycle which we can escape only by going through the destruction of a systemic failure even worse than the one we're still trying to recover from.  Many of us placed our hope for change in President Obama, and I still think he's a man of profound intellect and good intentions, but the results of his efforts for reform have been disappointingly weak, which just adds to my pessimism about how intractible the problem may be.<br /><br />If you want to flesh all of this out, this is a good documentary to watch, though beware that it can be depressing and can elicit much anger.
B001PB3RU8|5.0|With all the great music out there Florence + The Machine is definitely a stand out. You can't not listen every song of this album and not fall in love with Florence Welch's hypnotic voice. This is a certain quality of uniqueness laced in her voice that just draws you in regardless of how you're feeling. From the uplifting 'Dog Days', the triuphant 'Howl' or the beats of 'Kiss with a Fist' every song is filled with notes coated with the believable emotions in Florence's voice. Florence + The Machine will definitely be remembered as one of the greats of our time.
B00008GKEG|5.0|I maintain that The Beatles are the greatest musical influence since Bach.  You thought I was gonna say Mozart didn't ya?  I am a bass player, so Bach is more to my liking.  The reason I am a bass player is because of Paul McCartney.  I grew up in West Texas and before the Beatles, I was all Merle Haggard, the Everleys, and a little Miles Davis.  Hearing \\"Love Me Do\\" when I was 13 years-old changed my life.  I ended up playing bass guitar for a living, for not much money, for 12 years.  But, I digress.  For me, what makes this Anthology wonderful is watching The Beatles go through the changes they experienced.  It is so cool to see them progress as musicians.  One of the things that stood out for me was that through all of the changes they underwent personally, their music was their lives.  I think this documentary of the phenomenon is a must have for all Beatles fans.  These guys were the soundtrack of my life.  I still hurt when I remember watching Monday Night Football  on December 8, 1980 and hearing Howard Cosell announce that John Lennon had been murdered.  When I was married, my wife and I danced to McCartney's \\"My Love.\\"  I can't hear a Beatles song without it taking me back to some point in my life; some good, some bad, but all still alive in my heart and memory.  I know it sounds sappy, but it's like the feeling you get watching home movies.  It's a sublime pain that I enjoy inflicting on myself.  Buy this and watch it after smoking a big joint.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I'm glad I went with the Amazon Basics camera bag over one of the other brands Amazon has available. I've been using this bag for several months now, and I love it. I've carried quite a few backpacks over the years, and this is by far the most comfortable. The padding is easy on the back and shoulders, and it does a good job of protecting my cameras and gear.<br />The interior is spacious. The padding that protects the cameras and lenses inside is adjustable, so I can make everything snug and less likely to be jostled around with movement and bumps. I can carry nearly everything I need for outdoor photo-shoots with this bag.<br />My one and only complaint is that the straps on the outside for carrying a tripod felt a bit small to me. I've worked around that problem by carrying a monopod instead of a tripod, though I didn't make the change because of the bag. Carrying a tripod for an extended period of time is cumbersome--on or off of the bag--and tends to get a bit taxing when I've got a lot of walking to do, and a monopod changed that for me.<br />This bag is comfortable, spacious, plenty protective, quite affordable, and durable for the time that I have had it so far. This is an excellent piece of gear. You won't go wrong with this bag. I highly recommend it.

B003CIG7AE|5.0|In some people's minds, the biggest issue with Band of Horses is consistency.  From one album to the next, the band sounds different -- and that's because they ARE different.  Ben stated that the \\"rotating door\\" of musicians is finally still, and all members of the band (notably Ryan and Tyler) are contributing to the songwriting process.    I admit, it took me a little while to warm up to this album -- but then, it took me awhile to warm up to Cease to Begin, too.  Each album seems to be... well, a little happier.  Most of us love the dark edge of Everything All The Time, so it's harder to digest these mellower sounds.  Infinite Arms borders on the \\"beach\\" at times, on songs like \\"Dilly.\\"  But this is a solid, totally amazing record in its depth of harmony... and Ben totally kicks the ass out of songwriting all over Infinite Arms.  Tyler's \\"Evening Kitchen\\" and Ryan's \\"Older\\" are true standouts, and I have never been more confident in the Horses' potential as a true, albeit unique, supergroup.  Give this album a try... you will not be disappointed.

B004DI7HZ6|2.0|Unless you are really into history, whether fiction or factual, you will most likely find this book as boring as I did.  I give any book a chance, especially if it earns a \\"best seller\\" distinction, but after reading over half the book and never getting \\"hooked\\", I confess I had to give up reading it (which I rarely do).  After all the hype, I was very disappointed.   Too much detailed description of clothing, food, yoga, food, the library, food, etc. totally diluted the plot (?) and all I ended up being was hungry and desiring of a really good book.
B002K0WBXW|5.0|I have seen this movie three times and it gets better each time.  I especially enjoy the chemistry between Bullock and Reynolds as they play off each other very well.  Both are excellent actors and can pull off this movie in their facial expressions alone.  An entertaining and laugh out loud movie that gets better and funnier with repeat viewings.  Oh, and Ryan Reynolds naked only adds to the viewing pleasure!
B0042MDAL8|5.0|I have no opinion. However, I would suggest this movie along with the two others in The Twilight Saga. I believe a younger generation will appreciate it the most.
0446679089|2.0|This is funny with good characters and no plot divergences. The story itself is interesting - but it follows the basic \\"sizzle then fizzle\\" formula. The last 100 pages are filled with too many murders and an overly long and ultimately boring boat chase.
0316010669|3.0|Disappointment comes along when you get far less than what you'd expect. I am simply disappointed at this book. Read hundreds of pages to understand what the author tries to delivery to its readers. Here they are:<br /><br />- \\"Subconscious part of human brain can be overwhelmed and eventually become dysfunctional if loaded with more information than the brain needs in order to make decisions.\\" Well, this is called redundant info. This can, of course, paralyze your decision making process because your brain needs to factor this redundant data into decision making process even in the dark side (subconscious). So there is nothing new here.<br /><br />- \\"The dark-side of our brain, people can have biased attitudes towards others on the basis of race, gender, weight, height. Nothing fancy here either.\\" Even advertisers use various techniques to conquer a piece from this side of our brain to have us make biased decisions when we see their product on the shelf or TV. or simply switch to a news channel.<br /><br />- \\"Our subconscious is so powerful that sometimes it helps us see something while others keep looking or make decisions that turn out to be good later down the road.\\"<br /><br />- \\"Rapid cognition and snap judgements are some good examples of how human subconscious works.\\"<br /><br />It would be nice to read something about how this \\"subconscious\\" in human brain develops over time since we are born as the majority of the points in the book revolve around this \\"subject\\". Happy readings.
038572179X|1.0|He should have ended the book without the silly musings at the end by Brony who is the author  of the story within the story. We the readers know we are reading a book thats fictional, that is not true, so its lovely after having dedicated our time and energy to read your book and get lost in your world, you the writer pick an ending and stick to it rather than jolting us back to reality with , maybe I could have ended it this they live or maybe this way they died.
1439102813|4.0|\\"Still Alice\\" is a wonderful novel aiming to provide insight into the life and experiences one suffering from alzheimer's would likely experience. As Alice's abilities deteriorate, the writing style and pattern becomes simple, circular, and heavily relies on ambiguous wording such as \\"thingy\\". \\"Still Alice\\" is thoroughly entertaining, educational, and thought provoking. the reader is faced with difficult existential questions as Alice shifts her priorities and begins to consider her future quality of life.

0307473708|4.0|I got hooked on the show and couldn't stop watching. So now what better then to read the books from where the show originated. I loved being able to be inside Dexter's mind through the entire story, and getting to feel like I was really getting to know him. It made a lot of difference from watching the show. The story line of this book follows the story of the first season, however, it is different in such drastic ways which leaves the book to be unique from it's similar tv show. It really left me excited to read the next one, which was just how I was when I watched the show.
B00110K62U|5.0|I have put off ordering this because I read several reviews that said the quality wasn't very good and that parts were left out.  I've had the video for years but have been waiting for the perfect DVD to come out.  However, after watching the 25th anniversary concert, I knew I could put it off no longer.  This is the one to own, and I have been very happy with the quality.  It also has everything in it that my video does, except for the very long speeches at the end.  It does have the international Valjeans, however.  This IS the Dream Cast.  For me you just can't beat Michael Ball, Lea Salonga (as Eponine, NOT as Fantine!), Phillip Quast, Alun Armstrong and Colm Wilkinson.  There can be no comparison to the 25th anniversary concert, although there are pros and cons to both.  It was interesting to see the different portions that were added or left out in the new concert, and I LOVED Hadley Fraser as Grantaire in the 25th - why oh why didn't they use him as Marius (or anybody but Nick Jonas?!)?  But after watching the 25th anniversary concert, I HAVE to pull out the 10th just to remember how it's supposed to be done.  Get both if you can, but if you can only choose one, go for the Dream Cast.
B004NSVEAA|5.0|A rich, wonderful novel that weaves seemingly unconnected stories and people together in interesting and unexpected ways.  It's very different and visits places that most books don't.  Highly recommended.
B004L49K20|5.0|Duran Duran has returned for their first album since Red Carpet Massacre.  The Timbaland-produced album was a commercial and critical failure, and showed that while Duran Duran understood the kind of music that was popular at the time of the album's release, it simply did not fit Duran Duran as well as it should have.    Enter Mark Ronson and All You Need is Now.  This album has been declared as \\"Son of Rio,\\" and that's somewhat accurate.  Duran Duran is not simply retooling an old album here, however.  They are also making music that fits in with the time that most music fans are living in now:  We want to dance, and if we don't want to dance, we need to be gripped in another fashion.    From the title track opening the album to the somber conclusion in \\"Before the Rain,\\" we are given an album that is dripping with synth, harmonies and an attitude in the lyrics that boastfully revolves around women in the way that Duran Duran has done for decades--with lust, curiosity and ultimately, love for females that have gone in more ways than one.    This is possibly the defining Duran Duran album of the past few releases, it may go largely unnoticed in the bass-heavy, autotune-choked, unoriginal Billboard charts, but for true fans of Duran Duran and even those who are looking for music that recaptures the feel of the 80s and 90s and updates it for the new millennium, All You Need is Now is a welcome breath of fresh air.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I say well done! If people are so concerned about the films being untouched, more than likely you already have a copy of them or original box set laying around. Lucas always surrounded him-self with the best of the best in cinema and sci-fi movie making to have people see exactly what he saw when he wrote it. A completely different experience, and though technology wasn't the best, him and his crew worked with it. Now with technology he's able to enhance it even more to the way he wanted it. Bravo George for making it happen! I'm totally looking forward to it! ^u^

B004H83IG4|3.0|Is it always good for a son to be like the father?  This is a movie based on real events surrounding the disappearance of Kathie McCormack (Dunst).  Under mysterious circumstances she disappeared and though her husband Robert (Gosling) was suspected no one was ever brought to trial.  The movie opens and we find out that was Robert was seven years old he saw his mom violently die in front of him, and through out the movie we see the effect this had on him.  This is a good, but very slow moving movie.  This is a different role for Kirsten Dunst, who hasn't taken on a part like this since \\"Virgin Suicides\\", and she did a good job with it.  The movie's strength is the performance of Ryan Gosling who is excellent at playing a seemingly normal guy with major psychological issues.  It was such a convincing performance that everytime he is on screen you will tense up.  Overall it was a good movie, but I was expecting more.  Acting was really good though.  I give it a B-.<br /><br />Would I watch again? - I don't think I would
030746363X|3.0|I was excited mid-winter to pick up a copy of Tim Ferris's 4-Hour Body. I was hoping to boost my weight loss over the 10lb-a-month mark. Unfortunately, the book's `slow carb' plan was a contributing factor in my de-railment / stalling in my progress in the last few months.<br /><br />Some may find the `slow carb' plan helpful, mainly guys who don't like to cook and are willing to eat the same thing day in and day out (a key component to the plan), but it was not for me. In addition, Ferris' free binge day really tested me and opened up a realm of temptation that I was better off without. The eating plan goes like this:<br /><br />*Avoid \\"white\\" foods.<br />*Eat mostly proteins, vegatables and legumes.<br />*Don't drink your calories.<br />*No fruit.<br />*Take one day off each week.<br /><br />The big deal breaker, for me, was the `no fruit' stipulation. By the time I got to the `free' day each week I was so starved for something sweet that I really overdid it. I would spend the entire week losing what I'd gained on the weekend. It was a torturous routine.<br /><br />There is a lot more to this book than his `slow carb' plan, but my experience with that part of the book gives me pause to put stock in his other kooky ideas - like taking ice baths for weight loss.<br /><br />The book is based on his own self-experimentation, which is interesting and at times laudible. There are many interesting tips . . . anyway, I'd definitely suggest thumbing through a copy before purchasing, sight unseen.
B0041KKYEM|5.0|How far would you go to be perfect?  After her lifelong dream of being the lead in a ballet, Nina (Portman) finally gets her chance.  Pushing herself as hard as she can, she becomes so absorbed in the role it changes her life.  This is a difficult movie to review without giving too much away.  I can say that this is not your typical ballet movie.  This is the same director of \\"Requiem For A Dream\\" and that should tell you what type of film this is.  I would call this a borderline horror movie, and there are equal parts sex and blood as there is dancing.  Lily (Kunis) plays the Yin to Nina's Yang and the movie is better because of the two sides coming together.  The director did the near impossible with this movie, a ballet movie that guys will really enjoy.  I honestly can't say enough good things about this movie, or the the performances.  Portman deservedly won the oscar, and the fact that Kunis was snubbed in a big injustice.  If you don't want to watch this because of the ballet, keep in mind that it is only a part of the movie.  It is more of a trippy thriller than anything, a very good and well done movie.  You will not be dissapointed.  I give it an A.<br /><br />Would I watch again? - Yes, I would.  This is a movie that you will be able to catch different things each time you watch.
B004IFYMWK|4.0|How can you hide when everyone knows who you are?  This is the true story of outed CIA agent Valerie Plame (Watts).  After her husband Joe (Penn) writes a newspaper article contradicting the findings of the White House about \\"Yellow Cake\\" and the reasons for the Iraq war, her real name appears in the newspaper and her life is changed forever.  After finding out the White House was behind the outing her husband, Joe tries to take on the government.  This will be a hard movie for me to review.  I really enjoyed it, I love movies that spark debate, but it will be hard to keep my personal political views out of it.  This is another movie (there seems to be a lot lately) that because of a low budget and no explosions doesn't get the studio support that it deserves in order to get a wide release.  The performances are great.  Naomi Watts really steals the movie, which is hard to do opposite Sean Penn.  I really do recommend this movie, but it has the capability of polarizing people so be warned.  This is definatly a movie that will have you talking long after the movie is over.  I give it a B+.<br /><br />Would I watch again? - Yes, with a few people I know just so we can talk about it after.
B004EPYZP8|5.0|How far would you go to correct a wrong? After agreeing to take on a case he assumes is an easy win Mickey (McConaughey) soon learns appearances are deceiving. When he finds out the truth and tries to expose it his friends and family are put at risk. I have to admit I actually think McConaughey is very good at playing parts like this. As in \\"Time To Kill\\" and \\"Two For The Money\\". The smooth man pushed to the edge. Saying almost anything about the movie will give too much info away but I will admit that after being in the \\"Movie Business\\" for over 10 years I've seen enough that it's very hard for me to be surprised at a movies ending. The twist at the end of this one had me totally thrown and I love when that happens. I had high expectations for this and it surpassed them all. Watch this movie, you will not regret it. I loved it. As a plus this is a movie that exposes the flaws in the justice system, which will make you mad, and at the same time make you wish more lawyers are like Mickey Haller. I love this movie. I say A+.<br /><br />Would I watch again? - Absolutely, Im going to buy it!!!
B004KSQN7C|5.0|I've been a fan of Britney since 1999, and I had my doubts about the quality and depth of her new album, Femme Fatale.  I have to say, this is her best album to date!  Every song has its own unique vibe to it.  I suggest getting the deluxe version, the bonus tracks are amazing as well.  This is my favorite album of hers, not just because its new, but because it's more grown up and has great beats to it and because I think every song could stand on its own and be a single!  Great work Brit, thank you for taking your time putting this together, it is hot!  My favorites tracks are I Wanna Go, How I Roll, Big Fat Bass, Trip to Your Heart, Up n' Down, and He About to Lose Me, Selfish, and Scary.
159562015X|1.0|This book was provided by my employer as an HR exercise. Being one who rarely feels motivated to leave reviews, I have two main thoughts about this book:     Thought #1: \\"What a Brilliant Idea!\\"   -----------------------------------   As an entrepreneur, I can readily appreciate that this is the first book I've ever come across where the author ensures that:   a. You provide them with your email address, name, demographic info (such as age, gender, zip code, birthplace, etc)     b. Each and every reader must purchase the book new at an inflated price, because each book contains a unique code that can only be used once for their online test. In other words, you can't share the book with others as the book itself has no value. So don't plan on being able to get this from the library, lending to your family/friends, etc.     c. You really should think of the book cost as payment for an online personality test -- the kind that you normally wouldn't bother doing even if it were free.     Thought #2: \\"What a Total Waste of Money.\\"   ------------------------------------------   a. Firstly, I found the structure of the quiz itself to be fairly annoying. For instance, each question in the quiz asks you to rate two self-descriptions. However, many of these questions are not dichotomies. For instance, one question may be:   \\"Which characteristic to you most strongly identify with: (a) Motivating People, or (b) Encouraging People?\\"   Sorry, I've forgotten the exact questions now...)     b. Secondly, the actual results of the test are useless. After taking the online personality test, you are presented with a list of 5 \\"Strengths\\", each accompanied with a checklist of about 10 fairly obvious action items. For instance, my top strength according to this book is \\"Strategic\\". The book's top Idea for Action in my case is \\"Take the time to fully reflect or muse about a goal that you want to achieve...remember that musing time is essential to strategic thinking.\\" Wow, such insight!c. Before you bother buying the book, I fully recommend that you flip through it in a book store to see the kind of advice that you may get for a particular strength that you feel applies to you. If you find the simplistic suggestions to be as obvious as I have, then there is absolutlely no reason to buy the book. After all, there's no point in paying for the personality quiz (and giving the publisher all of your contact and demographic information) if the resulting suggestions have limited value.     The central concept of the book is: \\"Focus on utilizing your strengths, and don't get caught up on your weaknesses.\\" There, now that you read that line, you have no further need to purchase this book. You know what you are good at -- now look for ways to implement those strengths to help you to advance your goals and achieve your personal definition of success.     However, from a purely business standpoint, I must say: Kudos to the author and publishing house for trailblazing this new approach of closely linking interactive web content with the physical book. This is guaranteed to be a huge moneymaker for them, and will likely motivate other publishers to figure out how to require the use of one-time use activation codes in their own publications! Unfortunately, this doesn't bode well for shared knowledge and the free-exchange of ideas and resources with friends/family and libraries, but what an innovative business idea!
0064410935|5.0|Wilbur, the main character in the book, is a spring pig, born at Arable's hog house, and sold to Zuckerman's. Life was wonderful for him, especially when he ate. When the spring was at its peak, Wilbur made friend with a spider named Charlotte. One day in early summer, a sheep told Wilbur that the reason they are fattening him up is because of the hams or bacons they desire. When Wilbur heard this, he started to cry and become miserable than ever. Noticing her friend's misery, Charlotte decided to trick the humans to think the pig (Wilbur) is unusual and to leave him alone. As a result, Charlotte spun a Web initializing the words \\"Some Pig\\" and few others like \\"Terrific\\" or \\"Radiant\\".<br />At the day of the fair, Charlotte's day drew near, and at Charlotte's Web, a word \\"Humble\\" was there. For the egg sac, Wilbur cheers, and with the word, humble, Wilbur wins the special price and lives till the end. Although Charlotte is gone, her children are with Wilbur, being friends. Although they are great, they can't replace Charlotte in Wilber's heart.<br />#Warning: addiction rate is high! ^^
0061980269|5.0|Havent read this since High School.  I was viewing the Teach with Tony Danza and was inspired and motivated by what he did in Phillie, PA back in 2009-2010.  Im sorry that after all the hard work to get this program out that it didnt do better in ratings.  Additionally, sadden that Tony Danza and his wife have agreed at this writing to go for a divorce after almost 25 years of marriage.  Im praying that they will stop it though.  There is always hope.  Anyway, this was one of the books he was using in the 10th Grade English class on literature.
B003HFFVDQ|5.0|Songs on here are top notch in terms of any music being made anywhere. The Chemical Brothers have a few albums of recent that weren't as good as their older stuff (ie Dig your own hole) but this album is, without a doubt, a hit out of the park. I wouldn't expect to be \\"instantly\\" blown away by this CD, however it WILL happen I promise! Listen to \\"Another World\\" or \\"Swoon\\" if you need help deciding if you want to buy the album. The Chemical Brothers are musical geniuses without a doubt, and \\"Further\\" is for sure a great example of their talent, skill, beauty, art, creativeness, and intelligence. Please buy \\"Further\\" because you are directly supporting great music.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|Over all this book was a stimulating read. Sure there were little disturbances that caused me to stop my reading flow to think back to earlier references. Ms Harkness did very well, as this appears to be her 1st book. I even enjoyed the length of this book's plot. So many books end around 350 pages and seem to rush the final climax.
B00417HV14|5.0|Bona-who? This DVD features one of the best blues guitarists living today. After viewing it I went online and purchased concert tickets. Joe is \\"Always on the Road\\" and if you have a chance to see him, take the chance. If not, this is the next best thing. There is nothing like a live show from Joe. I've been showing this video to all of my friends and everyone is getting turned onto Joe and loving him. This isn't the typical blues-rock and his playing is nothing short of phenomenal. I can't believe the world has not embraced him more than it has, although with the release of his new album, Dust Bowl, which is debuting at #1 on the Billboard blues charts, I suspect his popularity will increase rather rapidly. Treat your eyes and ears and buy this DVD.

B00006CXSS|5.0|I read Stephen Ambrose's 1992 book Band of Brothers in 2009 while I was laid up in the hospital due to a motorcycle accident.  As a 20 year Army Retiree and First Sergeant I have affection for reading the real stories of men in combat.  This mini-series was first aired on September 9, 2001, two days prior to 9-11.  I had not seen the mini-series until after reading the book.  With many movies it is often said not to read the book first, or that reading the book will sometimes ruin the movie.  This was not the case with the mini-series as I don't believe it made a difference one way or the other.  So here are my thoughts on this powerful work of art focusing on the bravery of the men that made up \\"the greatest generation.\\"    This is a great mini-series from many standpoints.  First the storyline is taken from the book Band-of-brothers by Stephen Ambrose.  Ambrose researched the material and conducted many interviews with the actual soldiers.  The series is a chronicle of Company E, 2nd Battalion, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment.  The series revolves around the actual members of this unit and in particular around Dick Winters, the man who will eventually command \\"Easy Company\\" through the majority of combat they see in Europe.  The series begins with the men at their airborne training in Taccoa, Georgia.  Initially, the company is led by Lieutenant, later Captain, Herbert Sobel.  Sobel is hated by the men for his tyrannical approach to leadership, a method despised by Winters who would never-the-less credit some of Sobel's methods with actually helping the men in combat.  David Schwimmer, from Friends fame, does a very good job portraying the much hated Sobel.  The men begin to migrate towards Winters (Damian Lewis) as he becomes their protector.  Because of Winters and the time at Toccoa, the men of Easy Company build strong attachments that will see them through some horrific times in combat.  One key friendship is that of Winters and Lewis Nixon, played by Ron Livingston.  Nixon is a fellow second lieutenant and, even though leaving the Company prior to the Invasion of Normandy, is always close to Winters.  There are many other friendships that emerge through the series and unlike fictional movies, these friendships are real and continue throughout their lives.  These friendships are very important to the 10 episode series as is the bond formed by the entire company.  This bond separates this mini-series from its follow on \\"The Pacific\\" an equally masterful piece about the Pacific Theater of Operation which is told through the eyes of a select few individuals and based upon their wartime memoirs.    The combat begins after a train up period in England.  The second Episode \\"Day of days\\" revolves around the invasion of Normandy, D-Day.  The company is now in the middle of real combat, combat they have trained for yet they lose many men during the invasion.  A critical loss is that of their commander, who had replaced Sobel in England after the Easy Company NCOs threatened to resign if Sobel remained in command.  With the new Easy Company Commander gone, Winters is now moved into that role which he will hold for much of the remainder of the war until he is promoted.  The next seven episodes involve the combat operations that move Easy Company through France, Holland, and Belgium and then eventually into Germany.  The most horrific of these battles are those of Bastogne and the follow on battle of Foy.  Winters, now a Captain, has been moved up to Battalion as the executive officer.  The company suffers with the loss of his leadership which is not corrected until the battle of Foy when Winters has the Easy Company commander relieved by Lieutenant Speirs (Matthew Settles) who will be the final Commander of Easy.    The series winds down with the final two episodes showing the reality of the slaughter Hitler has undertaken against the Jews and other \\"undesirables\\" and the dangers of a post war occupation as well.  Through all ofthis you follow the men of Easy and cheer their triumphs as you weep for their losses.  The cinematography is excellent as is the costuming and technical aspects of the period.  As James Cameron did with Titanic, the directors and producers of Band of Brothers painstakingly researched the time period.  They ensured they had the correct uniforms, rifles, pistols, battle sequences and other references to ensure the historical reality of the series.  Again, this chronicles real men, so the Hollywood glitz and \\"bang\\" of fake combat is replaced by realistic portrayal.    This series is one of the truly accurate and remarkable portrayals of the life of soldiers in the World War II European Theater.  Band of Brothers will keep you entertained while reminding you of the sacrifices made for our Nation by these brave, yet humble, heroes.

0670022411|5.0|This novel falls into the current popular category dealing with witches, vampires, etc.  But, don't be fooled....it is at heart a great love story with some great fleshed out characters.  I thoroughly enjoyed the read.  If you liked Diana Galbaldon's \\"Outlander\\" Series, you will enjoy this book, too. I bought it based on a review in the Costco Connection Magazine, and am not sorry.

So I was HOPING that this would do the trick. Well, IT DID!!!! Now my headphones are just the right volume, and it made all of my In-Ear phones REALLY LOUD and with a better sound overall. Def the best $25.00 I have ever spent on anything electronic-wise ;) I would DEFINITELY suggest this to anyone looking for more power and volume out of their head/ear-phones :)
0312330537|4.0|I listened to this book on audio and loved it so much I purchased a hard copy for my library.  It's very long and the writing is kind of flowery and self-indulgent, but the story is wonderful.  My favourite part is when he lived in the slums.  I wonder if there will be a part two?
B004FGMV0W|4.0|I for one think Avril Lavigne is one of the best modern artists out there. She's got staying power, that's for sure. While nothing can possibly match the huge success and diversity of her first album Let Go (2002), this by far is her best since. Under My Skin (2004) was good but a bit too emo, and The Best Damn Thing (2007) was mostly forgettable if not for the B-sides. Goodbye Lullaby (2010) instead doesn't have any particularly stand-alone tracks. It's more of a 'listen from beginning to end' album, and that sort of an album is rare. The dud on the album is, sadly, Black Star, but only because of how short it is. The best song on the album, I cannot say. There are too many I enjoy, and do so equally. Again, this is an album that doesn't really have a special track. They are all good, and perhaps the reason why is because they all have a meaning. Nothing on this album was manufactured purely for the sake of getting it onto the radio (although What the Hell has done well, and rightfully so).  My favourite tracks are: Wish You Were Here, Smile, I Love You, 4 Real, and Stop Standing There (which I'm very impressed with, as Avril wrote that one herself).    If you want some meaningful, lovely pop, check it out. If you're after more of the edgy Avril, check out 'Smile'. Well worth the listen, but most likely the least popular of her albums, which is a shame.
B004A8ZWTW|4.0|When a story has been adapted for the big and small screen as many times as Charlotte Brontë's 1847 Bildungsroman, \\"Jane Eyre\\" (nearly two dozen times since the silent era according to my count), there are bound to be some changes in hopes of setting it apart from the pack when yet another incarnation arrives.    In director Cary Joji Fukunaga's \\"Jane Eyre,\\" the story begins out of sequence. Instead of finding Jane as a child, living in the oppressive and abusive Reed household as we do in the novel, the film begins with an adult Jane near starving and near death. Once rescued from the bitter cold by the Rivers family, her past is revealed to us as a flashback. This sequencing makes for a very absorbing film.    Every shot of the film is so rich with texture, and composed in such a way that it could be frozen in time and featured in Grace Coddington orchestrated shoot for \\"Vogue.\\" The authenticity is so exacting that at times you can nearly feel the fierce Yorkshire winds chill your bones. Costume designer Michael O'Connor shows appropriate restraint with the costumes (after all, our heroine is a plain Jane), but when his creativity is allowed to let loose, as it is with Mrs Reed and Lady Ingram, he produces some of the most exquisite period costumes I have ever seen captured on film.    The cinematography and costuming work most harmoniously together during the wedding scene between Jane (Mia Wasikowska) and Rochester (Michael Fassbender). Attired in her veiled wedding dress, Wasikowska looks so preternaturally beautiful-almost like a specter-echoing Rochester's description of her earlier in the film.    Wasikowska, seen last year in Tim Burton's \\"Alice in Wonderland,\\" makes for a wonderful, three dimensional Jane. She is forceful when it is required of her, but ultimately still manages to remain mousy, just at the character was original written over 160 years ago. Fassbender is a good and sympathetic Rochester, while Judi Dench is also standout as Mrs Fairfax, the housekeeper.    While some fans of the novel may be disappointed over some of the excisions for time, rarely have I seen a film that manages to catch the original spirit of its source material, while remaining unique and relevant in its own right, than Cary Joji Fukunaga's \\"Jane Eyre.\\"
B00000331V|5.0|J. Geils are mainly known for their 80's hits Centerfold, Love Stinks, Freeze Frame etc. However ignored their early 70's classics are...they need to be dug up and heard. J Geils Band were one of the premier live bands of the day. They were one of those bands that made good records, but truely needed to be captured live to really get it. They were a party band in the fullest sense, a good times rock n roll band, with spitfire guitar licks, groovy organs/pianos, chugging rhythm sections and the cooking frontman skills of Peter Wolf. Their 1972 live record \\"Live Full House\\" was great and just a few albums later, they released another live record in 76. Blow Your Face Out is a classic live record that really pulls together the laid back and fun party vibe of the 70's, a nonstop rocking show thats fire never goes out.    Starting out with the bravado opening Southside Shuffle and into the mid tempo punchers Back To Get Ya (featuring some great harp playing from Magic Dick), and the grooving Shoot Your Shot, the record really kicks into high gear with an awesome take of Musta Got Lost, one of the bands hits at the time, this version including a truely funny and satisfying intro piece form Wolf which has become a trademark. Following that the band rides that wave into a knock out set list including a great rolling cover of Where Did Our Love Go, the anthemic Love-Itis, and the crown jewel of any party rocker (Ain't Nothin' But A) Houseparty, which is preceeded by the only break in enegy, a brief and quiet organ/sang Lookin' For A Love, creating immense anticipation for the Houseparty. So Sharp, Detriot Breakdown, Sno-Cone, Wait, and Raise Your Hand all being periennel favorites of the bands live show, an inpenetrable spark folows through the whole album, you can really feel the crowd and the no holds barred fun attitude flowing through the whole time, this isnt just a concert album, its a portait of a lost time when music was fun and full of live and about moving. The extended rocking 'finish the show with a big jam' approach is dead on with probably the bands only known song from this period Give It To Me. Interstingly enough this is the one track from the bands first era that has somehow survived and is still a little recognized with the younger crowds that are only familar with Centerfold and the like.    Blow Your Face Out is one of the great live albums ever, fun, free wheeling, it puts a smile on your face, the band is contagious, full of energy, with cooking songs and the audiances enjoyment is translated onto the recording. If you're a fan of 70's rock, of the more boogie type variety this album is a must. Its the perfect soundtrack for any party.
B000000OPW|5.0|That's exactly what Tinderbox is. It represents Siouxsie & The Banshees at their absolute best. Whereas their previous album Hyaena was a bit all over the place, Tinderbox is more focused and guitar driven, harkening back to their 1981 classic Juju. Tinderbox is a perfect album featuring classic tracks such as This Unrest, The Sweetest Chill, Party's Fall, etc. Of course, the most recognizable song on the album is Cities in Dust, but if you just focus on that, then your missing out on a whole lot. All in all, Tinderbox is a classic record and is one of my top 5 favorite albums of all time. I highly recommend this album for any and all music fans.
B000VECAC6|5.0|I first saw this movie ages ago, and through the years completely forgot about its existence. Then I watched the Monty Python documentary \\"Almost the Truth\\" and they talked about this movie and showed clips from it. That brought back the memories and I realized I must have this film for my collection.<br /><br />I'm not gonna go into great detail about the film itself. If you haven't seen it by now, I can't help you. Buy the damn Blu-Ray (or DVD if you prefer), and see it. It is absolutely amazing and is some of the finest work the Monty Python crew has ever done. I love absolutely every single second of this film, and if you don't, you are probably a bad person. I strongly believe that the people who don't like this movie are the reason we can't have nice things.<br /><br />On to the Blu-Ray then. I bought this particular edition because of the stellar reviews, and I wasn't disappointed. The picture and sound quality is great. The only complaint (if you want to call it that) that I have is the menu. The writing on the menu can be a little difficult to make out at first glance, but it's not really that big of a deal.<br /><br />I haven't checked out the commentary or any of the other special features because honestly I don't really care much about all that stuff. I bought the Blu-Ray for the movie, not for all the extra crap. Well worth the cash for the movie alone, all the special features notwithstanding. In the time it took you to read this review, you could've bought this movie. How can you live with yourself?
B0000013GT|5.0|If I were to name the definite Outkast, then ATLiens would be it. After 1994's Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik, Big Boi and Andre decided that for their next record, they would change their sound. And thats exactly what ATLiens did when it dropped in 1996. At the time of its release, some people were wondering if this was the same group that put out \\"Player's Ball\\" in '94. With ATLiens, Outkast decided to move away from the southern pimp style of their debut, and focus more on their lyrical ability. And needless to say, they pulled it off nicely. Featuring production from both Organized Noize and Earthtone Ideas (Outkast's own production team), ATLiens shows Big Boi and Dre weren't your typical southern rappers. From Elevators (Me and You) to Jazzy Belle, and 13th Floor/Growing Old and other classic tracks, Outkast dealt with subject matter on this album that at the time, no other rap group had dealt with. Although Outkast would extend their musical ideas further with their next album, Aquemini, ATLiens remains Outkast's magnum opus. Definitely a must-have album for all true hip hop heads.

B00000JBFW|5.0|It was with the legendary Mark II lineup (Ian Gillan/Ritchie Blackmore/Jon Lord/Ian Paice/RogerGlover) that Deep Purple made their commercial breakthrough, and recorded a string of albums that helped define the fledgling hard rock/heavy metal genre in the early 1970's.  When internal pressures led to the departure of Gillan and Glover in 1973, it was the end of an era for one of the pioneering bands in hard rock.<br /><br />The reunion of these five musicians in 1984 was joyous news to Deep Purple fans, as the band had been disbanded since 1976.  In Perfect Strangers, the resurrected Purple produced one of their finest albums, returning to form with an updated version of the classic Purple sound.  All the members of course played a vital role, but the efforts of Ritchie Blackmore and Ian Gillan are particularly noteworthy.<br /><br />Gillan's singing style isn't about finesse.  He mostly relies on power and emotion to provide the drive for songs.  On Perfect Strangers he doesn't go for the screaming high end, but his vocals are rock solid throughout the album.  Blackmore's guitar playing is wonderful and inspired, quite simply the spark that drives the entire album.  His solos are often incendiary, from the blazing speed on A Gypsy's Kiss, to the emotional string bending slow burn of Wasted Sunsets.  Blackmore's guitar sound with Rainbow during the Joe Lynn Turner period had become a bit thin, but the trademark Blackmore sound is back nice and thick here.  Jon Lord is of course a big part of Purple's sound, and unlike the keyboard players in Rainbow, Lord's isn't going to be overshadowed by Ritchie's guitar.  As it was in the early days, the interplay between Lord and Blackmore brings out the best in each man.<br /><br />Knocking At Your Back Door, opens with Lord's ominous organ, leading to an unusual \\"snake charmer\\" type chord progression.  It's the same Purple sound, but the quality and depth of musicianship has grown.  Blackmore is busy playing some chunky rhythm fills and his solo doesn't come until the 3:40 mark.  It's dark, mean, and nasty, stinging like a whip.  Feel it coming, now you know the score, Deep Purple is back!<br /><br />The audio assault continues with Under The Gun, an aggressive track with plenty of Lord's organ, Glover's bass, and Paice's always steady drumming.  As in the past, when Blackmore's enthusiasm for playing rhythm wanes a bit, the others step up to fill the void.  Blackmore does delivers more blistering lead work, as his guitar wails and moans on this track.  Gillan's snarling vocals highlight the percussion heavy Nobody's Home, a bouncy song that features some unusual tempos and rhythms.  This is creative stuff, with Blackmore's teaser leading into Lord's organ solo, leaving Ritchie with an extended outro solo.<br /><br />Mean Streak is also aggressive, and features an extended guitar solo, but still seems to lack a spark.  The title track Perfect Strangers is kind of like Purple's version of Kashmir.  The main riff is simple and repetitive, and doesn't give Gillan much room, but he makes it work.  The secondary main theme that finishes off the tune is very solid and rhythmic, giving the tune an atmosphere of mystery and adventure.<br /><br />Speedy and energetic, A Gypsy's Kiss is one of the album's highlights.  Lord's organ is predominate leading into the classically influenced solo break, which is a masterful fusion of Blackmore's guitar and Lord's Hammond.  This is the magical interplay that had been missing for so long.  At the other end of the spectrum is Wasted Sunsets, a slow tune with little evidence of rhythm guitar, that becomes a showcase for Blackmore's winding and emotional solo guitar work.  Gillan's tight emotional vocal performance helps propel the song that shows the band's sensitive side.<br /><br />Hungry Daze is another aggressive tune with some speed and momentum, where the band keeps things interesting by changing tempos in the middle.  A bonus track when the album wasfirst issued on CD, featuring some spicy guitar playing, Not Responsible should have been on the original vinyl record.  Son Of Alerik, is a second bonus track added in subsequent editions of the CD.  It is a meandering bluesy instrumental reminiscent of the kind of spacey live jams Deep Purple was known for in the 1970's, with Lord and Blackmore trading leads.  It's cool to have, though it may not quite fit in with tone of the rest of the songs.<br /><br />On Perfect Strangers, Deep Purple bring a new energy to their music.  Together again, there is much that is familiar, but the members have all grown as musicians and people, and that is reflected in the material.  Produced by mainly by Roger Glover, the music is still powerful, but displays a maturity that wasn't possible before.  The album is essential for any fan of the band, and highly recommended to fans of hard rock.icy guitar playing, Not Responsible should have been on the original vinyl record.

0618918248|4.0|As an evolutionary biologist, Dawkins spends a lot of time explaining why nothing complex can appear fully formed, intelligent, self-sustaining, without first having developed. The crux of the book as it appeared to me, was that therefore God cannot exist. Basically, Christian theological conceptions of God are false because they contradict scientific knowledge of evolution. I think this is a fair argument - but based on a limited view of the idea of \\"God.\\" Dawkins also argues against the usefulness of religion, because it causes too much violence and negativity while producing too few fruits; and also because the spiritual/religious mindset is itself a product of human evolution. While I have no problem with the above arguments, and Dawkins can hardly be expected to debate every conception of divinity in human history, it seems his case leaves open the possibility of an evolving, divine being of some sort (for example, the figure of John a.k.a. Dr. Manhattan in \\"The Watchmen\\" - human consciousness that got separated from material matter through a scientific experiment gone wrong and later developed divine powers). While completely supportive of the need to question, challenge, and oppose religious belief when it is detrimental to human society and civilization, certain aspects of the human experience which may be termed \\"spiritual\\" are not to be discarded so easily.

B004NSULHM|1.0|Radiohead has been one of my favorite bands for years. Got into them when i first heard the Bends. It's been quite a ride since. Great albums, great music by a band always exploring new frontiers with incredible craftsmanship. I listen to these great albums The Bends, OK Computer, Kid A, Hail to the Thief, and In Rainbows on a more or less constant basis. My favorite album? All of those five albums are co equals, in my mind, as it changes from month to month. Amnesiac, to me, is an uneven, patchy  album with a mixture of some great songs along with filler. It's one that I do not play nearly as often. So I really enjoy Radiohead's music, seen them in concert three times, even bought all their special editions to the albums just mentioned.    Hearing they were releasing a new album ,The King of Limbs, after their last masterpiece In Rainbows, it was a special event for me. What new masterpiece; what new direction would this fantastic band go into? Bought, downloaded the album with great expectations and listened waiting for that special Radiohead magic to take hold of me & you know what? Nothing ever happened. Kid A was an album that I couldn't quite get into at first; in fact, most of Radiohead's music takes more than a few listens. Their music has a lot of depth of musical textures. However, Kid A eventually revealed itself to be a masterpiece; one that I've become addicted to over the years. The King of Limbs just wasn't doing anything for me.  My wife, also a Radiohead fan, was equally puzzled by The King of Limbs. After many listens (about 30), we both decided we simply didn't like it. A very first for both of us. it's an atmospheric album which, quite frankly, bores us. There's nothing for us \\"to get\\". There's no meat, substance to this music. This is Radiohead on autopilot; an album they could have made in their sleep. There doesn't seem to be any emotion, songwriting here. It's a sleepy, lifeless album. The King of Limbs is just not for us. We still have theirmasterpieces & we are both hoping (praying) for something better next time around.

B004DI7HZ6|1.0|This book is probably one of the top 5 worst books I have EVER read.  This review will be brief, because Amazon reviewer Mlle. X summed it up much better than I could have ever done.  Search for her 1-star review.<br /><br />In a nutshell, this book is incredibly boring.  Nothing exciting happens, and none of the characters are the least bit engaging or interesting.<br />The lead is a 35 year old woman who is not only a tenured professor at Yale, she is also the most powerful witch who has ever lived.  Only she doesn't realize it until some vampires point it out.  Then she still doesn't seem to be able to do much....and relies on the vampires to feed her, clothe her, and tuck her into bed.  She sleeps more than a newborn.  It's ridiculous.  16 hours, then 3 hours on the plane, then another nap, and then early to bed again.  What?  The author attempts to make her seem all girl-power, but then reduces her to a needy, sniveling pliable woman dependent on the other characters-- not the powerhouse she really should have been.  Oh, and did I mention that nothing happens in this book?  Because yeah, it really doesn't.  It's apparently the first of a series, and apparently more happens in book #2?  I, for one, will not be sticking around to find out.<br />I would like the time I spent reading this book back now, please.  Yowza- it's really just that bad.
030726999X|5.0|After probably millions read book 1 and 2, this trilogy came to be because I saw #1 & #2 in paperbacks.  After I got past the violence, sex, and 'gore', I was fascinated by the plot, the characters and the country.  Just could not wait for this third book to come out in paperback so I had to read more about Salander and all the characters, inspite of the book being only in a hardback.  This third book is even better than the first two, with character development, far-reaching plot, dastardly public-political deception being even more intense.  Truly, what a great read !  But it is heavy to carry around....

B004FRX0MY|3.0|While the CloudPlayer is awesome, and I'm glad someone finally did it, the app itself still needs some work.  Right now, it does not seem to be capable of completely smooth streaming over a mobile connection (and Wi-Fi, some say).  Even more maddeningly, the app displays unpredictable behavior in the face of sound alerts on my Motorola Droid 1...playback will stop and not resume (with on-phone MP3s) or start randomly after an audio alert.  Fix these two issues, and it'd be a five-star app.<br /><br />Otherwise, Amazon did a fantastic job with the CloudPlayer!

B004H4XI5O|3.0|Like many self-improvement books, Moonwalking with Einstein is long on narrative and short on practical 'how to improve your memory.'  The narrative is well written and easy to read.  Most of the 'how to memorize things' is in the context of memory contests, and not very applicable to everyday business.  (Mr. Foer does mention this towards the end of the book.)<br /><br />Overall, this book is a good read, but do keep your expectations reasonable for your personal memory improvement.
B003EYVXSW|5.0|I wasn't expecting Splice to be as memorable as it was.  Absolutely *exciting* the entire time- that's the best way to describe my honest feelings.    The storyline is just terrific and done in a way that's neither confusing or overbearing.  It's about a man and his girlfriend (or wife, I forget) who are both scientists, and they spend quite a bit of time experimenting and creating creatures in their lab that are part human and part... something else.  As you can guess, this is totally illegal, so they have to constantly keep a low profile and hide their results during inspections and other times.    Well the results are that the creatures that form are anything but normal (without spoiling too much for you, my loyal readers, hehe).    What makes Splice a little different from most movies that fall in the same category is that you get to witness the creature start out as just a baby and watch it grow and develop with every new scene.  If you find these kind of films interesting, you will no doubt be sitting there and constantly guessing just what *will* the creature do next.  There's no telling.     The man and woman play the role of parenting the adorable creature (yes I admit, it WAS adorable).  They soon discover that it's female.  At first the thing jumps around all over the room making the man and woman VERY nervous that it might need to be put down immediately, but after some heavy convincing on the part of the girlfriend, the creature lives on.    I absolutely love the way the storyline rolls along.  Excellent writing because it keeps you wanting to know more.  You get to experience the creature go from a baby, to a teenager, and finally to an adult.  When it finally does become an adult (which happens extremely quickly, might I add) *this* is when things get interesting (and no, I won't be spoiling any key moments of storytelling- sorry!).    So no, this is most certainly NOT a storyline about some chaotic monster experiment that eventually takes out the entire world- this particular movie is about a creature that sticks around a distinct group of people that it seems to refers to as family, and it's really appealing to witness the creature try to communicate with the man and woman throughout the film, and how much information it's capable of absorbing and understanding.     One outstanding scene is when a presentation takes place inside an auditorium showing two baby creatures and their potential, and while locked inside the glass cage, something goes horribly wrong involving lots of blood and stabbing, resulting in everyone who attended the presentation to immediately take off running.  This scene was my favorite in the entire movie because the suspense was overwhelmingly superb.    Overall, yes.  Splice does everything right.  It's entertaining, suspenseful, and while I initially didn't care for the acting in the beginning, it eventually won me over as well.  Just a great suspense (or sci fi- whichever one you feel more comfortable referring to it as).
B002ZG976U|4.0|This has what Chicago 2002 doesn`t: great musical talents in the leading roles. It suffers from a weak script, but improved upon by the star quality of the three principals; Cher, Anguilera and Gigandet.<br /><br />The musical numbers however are ace and reminiscent of the 1972 Cabaret starring Liza Minnelli, Joel Grey and Michael York.<br /><br />Christina steals the show and the only real weak spot is the intro to Cher`s big number \\"You Haven`t Seen the Last of Me!\\" - the dj asks - \\"have you got the time to do it\\"(or something like that) and she answers \\"Oh I completely forgot.... yeah ok - let`s do it\\".. ooooh woops....<br /><br />The song and performance are however of vintage Cher quality.<br /><br />This film belongs in every shelf of a musical lover:)(:

1594202842|1.0|In the past two months, two authors have written about the college admissions process. One of them, Amy Chua, did so perhaps unintentionally when she described her uber-parenting approach, one designed to secure her kids a place at Harvard and Yale. (Psst: Why did she bother, given her kids' legacy status?) On the other hand, Andrew Ferguson, who is a lot wittier, has produced a tome that, though written in the first person, manages to be everything that Chua is not: informative. fact-driven, charming, humorous, and sympathetic toward his most precious asset: his kid. This book is a keeper: it is a seamless meld of hard facts about the college admissions process with enough anecdotal asides to keep you laughing all the way to your college tour with a smarmy sophomore who walks backwards for 90 minutes. This is one of the few books that you can quote unabashedly at the next Mensa kaffeeklatsch or stuff in your beach bag -- if you can manage to wait until summer to read it. Even if you don't have a kid, or you want to pretend you don't have a kid, this book is a great read.

0307593495|4.0|I have not been one to enjoy a spate of good murder mysteries until this past year. That said, in the past I have read murder mysteries by such diverse authors as Diana Mott-Davidson and John Sandford, so this genre of books are in my repertoire; they just are not my norm. However, when offered the opportunity to read the latest Henning Menkel book I jumped at the chance.    I opened the book with, I will admit, some trepidation. I enjoy the Wallander television series and feel Kenneth Branagh does a snap job of portraying a somewhat dry, often depressed and unsmiling detective Kurt Wallander but to read an entire book composed of dry and lifeless conversation seemed a bit daunting. Imagine my surprise when one morning I laughed out loud at a line of conversation between Wallander and another character in the book. I actually asked my spouse if I had just laughed out loud and, in fact, I had. Obviously, this is not a humorous book but it is a book that speaks to you of someone not unlike yourself who has chosen to be a policeman and solve heinous crimes.    I still feel that Menkel's style is one of simplicity. Simple dialogue, simple premise for a murder in a simple land and yet you cannot put the book down. I felt compelled to turn page after page to keep reading even though I had other deadlines to make. I finished the book in record time with an inexplicable feeling of emptiness perhaps because it appears this is Kurt Wallander's last appearance in the printed media. I suppose all characters eventually  must have the last story written about them but having just discovered Henning Menkel's Sweden and  Kurt Wallander I was not prepared to say goodbye.    It seems I have read things totally out of order as this is my first Henning Menkel book but it will not be my last. As soon as I finish my long line of Elizabeth George books, Henning Menkel's books will fill my shelves.

B0041KKYBA|3.0|A must see film, (entertaining) but please try to understand the real issues...    I originally watched this film in the theater and thought it would help the Freedom Movement by waking up a few more people.  Indeed, this is an important film that should help to rile up some average Sheople from their false prosperity trance.    Unfortunately, while the film accurately nails the symptoms of a corrupt financial system, it misses the underlying cause of the disease completely.  The movie \\"Inside Job\\" focused on the corrupt actions of: politicians, university professors, financial organizations, regulators, and rating firms that competed on the Wall Street Monopoly game board with  monopoly money provided by a failed economic monetary system (a system the movie does not discuss).   The people who failed to regulate and those who leveraged the system for their gain and the gain of their cronies is enabled by an unconstitutional  system of autonomous central banks.     The entire time I watched \\"Inside Job\\" I eagerly awaited the transition in the story line from the symptoms and mechanisms of a failed system to the obvious root cause,  but sadly it never happened.   An opportunity missed, in a otherwise great documentary    \\"Inside Job\\" rightfully points guilt of the players who gamed the system, but at the same time (by omission) gives the underlying failed fiat monetary systems (and the Central Banks), that enable this type of crisis and corruption, a free pass from scrutiny.     Austrian School author Jeffery Tucker's review of the movie Inside Job put it best:         \\"The biggest problem was that the narrative never asked where all these paper profits were coming from. The monetary angle eluded them completely. ...So rather than looking carefully at the monetary system that generated all this paper, they filmmakers looked to presidents and their great black beast of \\"deregulation.\\"        Tuckers review can be found by searching for \\"Inside Job: A Look at the Heartof the Left\\"

There's also a little bonus disc for the UK Tour 75 disc that would be later released. It has 7 tracks, and I thought it was a nice addition. Fantastic package for the price. Buy it!

0307272702|5.0|This is a marvelous book. I devoured it in practically one sitting. It makes beautiful sense. I immediately applied what it said by going to a brunch and gorging on proteins and fats and very little in the way of carbohydrates. The result? The next morning I weighed in at half a pound less than the morning before.     This book also gave me the best laugh I had in years. In his chapter five, the author cites cattle breeding practices to show how genetic predisposition can affect fat distribution and fat/lean-mass ratio. He explains that Jersey cows are bred to be skinny with large udders and Angus cows are bred to be meaty, with marbled fat in their muscle so the meat will be tender. The accompanying illustration refers to \\"the skinny cow on the bottom\\" and \\"the stocky cow on the top\\". But one doesn't need to be a farmer to see right away that \\"the stocky cow on the top\\" is not a cow at all, but in fact very much a bull. I may need a life, but I've been laughing about this all week.    Thank you, Gary Taubes, for a great book -- and also a great laugh. Thank you also, Gary Taubes's editor.

B003G4W49C|3.0|First off, this is the type of book that I should have loved - sci-fi blended with YA.  Ender's Game seems to meet all of the requirements of many modern novels - child hero, mystical/magical aspects, nasty bullies and clueless adults.  Sadly, I ended up disappointed about 2/3 through the book.  The book can be repetitive, but rushes through other situations that would have been better explored.  I will give it credit for being written in the 70's.  Maybe I would be like so many others and give it 4 or 5 stars if I had read it then.
030745455X|5.0|The Girl Who Played With Fire by Stieg Larsson<br /><br />This is an outstanding mystery that will hold your attention to the very last word.  This is without a doubt fictional investigative journalism at its very best.  What is interesting is that the very foundation of the book is investigative journalism and the protagonist, Mikael, is grossly dissatisfied with his own media and their morals.<br /><br />I started my recommendation of The Girl With The Dragon Tatoo using the same sentence as above.  This book may be even  more so.<br /><br />Lisbeth Salander is back with a vengeance.  This book gives us even more insight as to how she became who she is.  The plot is illustrative of governmental and bureaucracy that has run amuck and is eminently believable.<br /><br />Once again, Mikael Blomkvist character demonstrates ethics and tenacity that is seldom seen in real life.  If only the main stream media would take a page from Mikael's fictional portfolio of ethics.  His tenacity in the face of daunting adversity was a joy to read and made it extraordinarily difficult to put the darn book down.<br /><br />I will repeat my caution from the last book recommendation, you are a flaming idiot if you underestimate a woman due to her size, demeanor or gender.<br /><br />The character development and depth of detail makes this book.  It is impossible not to become immersed in the story.  I am currently reading the third and last book and so far it is as stressful to put down as the first two.<br /><br />I strongly recommend the book!

B0037QGS0A|4.0|Julianne Moore, Liam Neeson, and Amanda Seyfried star in this thriller about infidelity and betrayal.  Moore stars as Catherine, a gynecologist who is planning a surprise birthday party for her college professor husband David (Neeson).  When David fails to arrive home on time, Catherine suspects that he is having an affair.  Her suspicions soon turn to paranoia, and she hires the services of escort Chloe (Seyfried) to seduce her husband.  Soon, Chloe is providing Catherine all of the steamy details of her seduction of David.    Unexpectedly, Catherine begins to have feelings of her own towards Chloe, and the two women begin a torrid affair of their own.  But, are appearances all that they seem?  Has David really been cheating on Catherine, or has Chloe somehow managed to manipulate both David and Catherine?    I found \\"Chloe\\" to be a very good movie.  The acting by Seyfried, Neeson, and Moore is very good, and the plot is well-conceived.  The story is full of twists and turns, and the viewer is kept guessing throughout.  \\"Chloe\\" is full of suspense and will keep you on the edge of your seat.  Highly recommended.
0312360258|1.0|I've always been a fantasy fan, and I've read some truly amazing fantasy and some horrible fantasy, but `Marked' is definitely one of--if not--the worst. I don't know why I read this book. I think it killed some brain cells, but I suppose that's partially my fault for not putting it down as soon as I realized how stupid it was. There are so many things I disliked about it that I can't put them all down, and since other reviewers have done a pretty good job of pointing out all the book's faults, so I'll just mention a couple pet peeves.<br />Problem #1--The quality of the writing, or lack thereof. I don't know what kind of audience this book could possibly be aimed toward. The blatant vulgarity and sexual content keep it from being appropriate for younger people, and no self-respecting older teen could possibly read this and think, \\"Oh yeah, this definitely how I talk/act/think! I can so totally relate to these vapid, vulgar, weak, stereotypical teen characters!\\"  Not even Zoey, who's supposed to be the sympathetic protagonist, is remotely likeable. I mean, seriously, guys. I'm a little older than the high schoolers this was obviously written for, but I know that I never talked, thought or behaved anything like the characters from `Marked.' There are also lots of annoying stereotypes, such as the blonde cheerleader villainess, the borderline-racist portrayal of Zoey's African-American friend, the stereotypical gay friend, the hick friend (how many times can one book use the phrase `Okie twang'?). Oh, and it's sexist. No guy ever gets to do anything remotely fun or interesting; the guys are just around to look good and be fought over by the girls. Additionally, the writing itself was bad. Scattered pop culture references do not make it amusing or light-hearted, as I assume the authors intended it to. It's my understanding that the younger Cast was supposed to give the book an authentic teen voice, and all I can say to that is EPIC FAIL.<br />Problem #2--The in-your-face anti-Christianity. `Marked' is scattered with little anti-Christian barbs that I could maybe forgive if it were otherwise a good book, but in this context I really find it objectionable. Every single Christian that appears in `Marked', most notably Zoey's stepdad, is a horrible, hypocritical, egotistical worthless human being. The Christian faith is ridiculed repeatedly. First of all, this is bad marketing--think of the audience they're losing by doing this. Secondly, I wish someone would have pointed out to the Casts that many of the greatest fantasy writers were Christians--for example, J. R. R. Tolkien, who basically invented modern fantasy, was a Roman Catholic; C.S. Lewis of Chronicles of Narnia and Space Trilogy fame, belonged to the Church of England. Well-known YA fantasy author Madeleine L'Engle was a Christian. J.K. Rowling is as well. I could go on, but my point is, before they go around bashing Christianity, the Casts should probably take into account that some of our best fantasy was built on a Christian worldview.<br /><br />Anyway, those are the big problems I had with the House of Night series, but as other reviewers pointed out, there are many more. Save your money, save a tree, and don't buy this book. I promise it's not worth it.Christianity. `Marked' is scattered with little anti-Christian barbs that I could maybe forgive if it were otherwise a good book, but in this context I really find it objectionable.

Do not watch it if you want action, explosions, gore, violence, etc., but if you want a deep movie that will make you think, wonder, and truly \\"feel\\" for the main character, this is your flick. Sam Rockwell has totally earned my respect after this movie, and Kevin Spacey's cold, robotic voice has never been better utilized than here. This is certainly one of the best low-key movies that I have seen in years, and is criminally underrated!

B004SKWP6A|4.0|Once again Sum 41 has evolved. It seems that for Sum 41 each new album brings a new style - I like it! There are lots of fast tracks on this album, and it rocks hard all the way through. It's certainly not their best (AKNF and Chuck will always be their best) but it is nontheless a good, solid, rocking album. Feels very percussive, and a little heavy. The impression I got when I first listened to it was a mix of My Chemical Romance and Chuck. No doubt the band is maturing, especially Derek, and it's all for the better.
B000SMQ1WQ|5.0|I got this for my husband's birthday, and he was so excited. It was brand new and came quickly in the mail.
B003Y74AZ2|4.0|My review will be quick and concise :)    Value for money:   * Good: Pretty good case for a rather cheap price.     \\"Installation\\":  * Very easy to put it on and take it off  * No need to take it off in order for it to fit to my iHome    Grip:   * Better than a standard silicon case, it's kind of stiffer and I really liked it.  * Slide easily into your pocket  * Holds well on any surface, I like to put it on my leg - and it holds well!  * The case holds the phone almost perfectly (at least in my case), there is a certain point where is has some gap, but generally good.    Looks:  * I took the black one, and really liked how it looks. It has some spiral texture at the back, which makes it interesting, but not too loud.  * Overall look is pretty good, specifically in black, though my friend claims it should be thinner.    Dirt:  * From time to time, you will find small grains on it, like salt and other kinds of dirt. This is a bit annoying, but they go off quickly.
B0030BCCB6|5.0|The best of classic British blues can be heard in this collection of the first 3 albums from Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac. Green's distinctive shimmering vibrato tone that he somehow coaxed out of his guitar is truly chilling. If you already have \\"The Chain\\" boxset, you have a good compilation of these albums on Disc 4.  For Green fans, I also would strongly suggest \\"Then Play On\\" and Green's 1979 solo return, \\"In the Skies.\\"
B003VANOFY|5.0|I have this headsets for over a month now, i can tell you they are great. I run on Win7 32 bits, and i don't have any problems whats so ever. There are a lot of great things like the sound, surround, range, battery life and so on...     I want to tell you guys about the problems i've noticed there are small problems but all in all 5 out of 5 stars:    - the driver needs a lot of work to start with the charging monitor - it does't tell you when the headsets are full when you are charging them...  - a few noises in the joints that gives the impression of low durability, but i haven't had any problems what's so ever.  - low versatility of the G keys, but i think this is a driver problem      That's about it. All in all a great headsets @ great price.    Buy, play Have Fun!!!
B004SBX112|5.0|I wish all android games were like this....reasonably priced, addictively fun, creative, funny, entertaining...and most important...a well rounded finished product.  This game is basically a reinvention of the old artillery games where you launch a projectile at an object and if you compute the right angle to fire, you score a successful hit.  In this game the projectiles are the angry birds and you get a very decent and entertaining challenge as you attempt to clear the board of pig creatures with the most points possible.  This app and sequels will be around for a while and great fun for all ages.
1401323952|5.0|I bought this book purely because the moment i flipped through it at the bookshop, i LOVED it's layout and the fact that it's Nigella and i love the way she writes. In fact it's the best layout of a cookbook i've seen. And i have a lot!!    It's not as good of a selection as her other books, but i mean, how many recipes are there...i think she's covered the lot!!     My first favourite part, like i said, was the layout.  The reason is; first of all, the writing is a brownish colour and not the usual black. I find it prettier and easy on the eyes. Another thing for me is that i love the placement of the page numbers. She's put them at the edge of the page but instead of the bottom, they're in the middle. I love this. It's so much easier to flip through and go to. Another aspect for me is that i love the love hearts she has put instead of the usual numbers or dots. This may not seem a big deal, but i have so many cookbooks and i'm at a point now that i want to see some practical prettiness to my books i buy! I feel this does the job :)     As always i love that she talks a lot about why she loves a particular dish. I always want to know what the cook thinks about the particular food they make or what they would pair it with, what drink or what dessert they would use along with it. As always Nigella does.     The main dish that stuck out for me (there are a few :P ) but the first one was Salmon and sushi rice. I love sushi and the rice is really the kind of thing i like. I love salmon and any oriental inspired dish. This really hits the spot!     Another is the egg and bacon salad. I'm new to appriciating salads and the pictures look really appetizing!   The marinades look amazing and taste great too. There is also an impressive selection of desserts and all importantly a selection of cheesecakes!     I love how Nigella always manages to make any sortof food seem so easy to prepare and i'm always interested to know what she thinks of any dish :)
B001CDD84Y|3.0|This isn't a bad movie, but the entire thing was very predictable - you feel like if the trailer were a bit longer, you'd have watched the movie.
B002ZG976U|5.0|Music and costumes are great.  Cher never disappoints.  Christina Aguilera susrprised me, I enjoyed her singing and her acting.  This is one movie I will enjoy watching over and over.  This movie makes me want to get up and dance.

He especially like the part wherre the sabres light up.  He takes it to alot of the family get-togethers.  His mother helps him read it.  Very glad I bought it for him.  Jeanne Smith
1439102813|5.0|Working with the elderly and alzheimers patients, I was curious to learn more by reading this book and I did! The book sucks you in and you feel like you are going through what Alice is going through. I got a greater perspective on what my clients are going through and thought of ways I can help more. As her disease is progressing and your reading along, there will be parts, that all of the sudden rip your heart out and water your eyes. Very emotional book to read for anyone. Everyone should read this book!

B0034G4OXQ|4.0|I really enjoyed this film.  Another fine directing job by Clint Eastwood and executively produced by Stephen Spielberg... these guys do not make junk (lol).  I gave \\"Hereafter\\" 4 stars instead of 5 because I would have appreciated a bit more weight to the film, but overall it was well acted, interesting and beautifully done.  A gentle view of what might be.<br /><br />4.5 stars!
6302642248|3.0|I took this out of the Disney rotation.  A little wooden boy doing \\"bad\\" things that really are bad.  Drinking beer and smoking cigars (and whatever else).  Glad I could still find it on VHS for cheap, just disappointed that there's so much junk in there.  Not worth the explanations that a 2 year old would demand.
B004FOA84A|3.0|This game is visually striking and has a cool spooky feel to it. It seems to have been inspired by the old pc game The Uninvited, which is a classic, but it took me less than an hour to beat it, and once you do, you will never play it again. Totally worth 99&cent; but don't expect too much.
B0041KKYDI|5.0|There is nothing more powerful than the human will to survive.  When we are at our most vulnerable, at the end of our sanity and endurance,  is when we truly find out who we are and what we are made of.   I don't have to tell you all that this is based on a very true story.    James Franco gives an incredible and singular performance in this harrowing  tale of human triumph over seemingly insurmountable circumstances.  We ask ourselves what would we have done in this predicament...  Would you give up and just die slowly and painfully?  Or, would you do the unthinkable, which is what Franco's character does,  to survive those insane 127 hours, to make it out alive?  This is a very powerful film; well-directed, well-acted, and it deserves  all the praises that it has gotten.   Kudos again to the brilliant James Franco, who was simply amazing in this!

0446691437|4.0|Product came in perfect condition. I'm only about 1/4 of my way through the book, but it so far has been pretty decent, although there really isn't a formula to getting rid of procrastination. Thus far, it's nothing I haven't already heard. Information about how there is a \\"Resistance,\\" (the inherent ability to procrastinate) that, like sin, we must spend our time practicing how to overcome it.    I especially like in the first book where he writes the line about how it was easier for Hitler to start World War II than to face a blank canvas. I think any artist can relate to this line.
B002ZG9774|4.0|I originally saw the movie in theater and enjoyed, like the music - now own the movie and the soundtrack. Burlesque is a fun and light-hearted with lots of dancing and predictable plot, but one that you complete the movie feeling good..

B004I2K4DY|5.0|I was always somewhat indifferent to Les Miserables, preferring Phantom of the Opera instead, until I saw this show. It is absolutely fantastic and made me fall in love with Alfie Boe and Norm Lewis as Valjean and Javert. The interplay between the two is incredible, particularly on The Confrontation. I have the 10th Anniversary concert edition, and the current US 2010 cast, but neither has the arrangements on some of the pieces as this concert does. Where is the audio cd version of this concert so I can listen to it on my ipod or in my car as well?
B0041KKYEW|5.0|Okay, I'm not squeamish when it comes to movies. I've seen plenty of disturbing films and walked away from them laughing.     I just finished watching the Black Swan. I am not laughing. I am sitting at my computer, trying not to shake. This is the single most disturbing film I have ever seen. This is the first time I ever recall jumping out of my chair while watching a movie.     I can see how many people would walk away shrugging. It's slow building drama, and not really a horror movie despite what my previous statements would imply. That said, I'm not sure I could EVER watch this movie in the dark. I've seen it, I know what happens but let's face it, I was still shaking when I started writing this review.     The movie is, to put it bluntly, beautiful. I'm not a big fan of ballet, but I've seen performances before and this movie captures everything that is good about ballet. The scenes are amazingly choreographed, both scenes on the stage and off. (Pay attention to the music while watching the film. Everything is practically a dance. I also know enough about music to be bracing myself after a while, you can time the disturbing actions to the soundtrack and that makes it worse rather than better.)     I honestly am at a loss for words. I want to review the film, but my mind just seems to rebel. I feel the movie is borderline perfect, yet, I don't think I know if anyone else would feel that way. I'm not even sure if it would disturb anyone else... I don't even really know why I'm disturbed, but this movie has REALLY got to me.     Beautiful and disturbing: the best words to describe this film. That and  Darren Aronofsky's best.
0312600844|1.0|\\"Corrections\\" is an excellent novel.  \\"Freedom: A Novel\\"?   I can't believe it was written by the same author.
1439102724|5.0|Now I admit, I wasn't sure how this novel would turn out- mainly because it didn't seem to involve a mystery aspect to it like my favorite novels by her do. This was more of a journey into the complexities in human relationships and how religion don't always go hand in hand.<br /><br />The way she portrays the gay/lesbian community is right on key. And the way she portrays the (somewhat scary) side of a religious denomination had my mind reeling.<br /><br />By far one of the best she's done yet :)
B003UESJFG|3.0|Love this movie. Saw in theaters. My daughter used her money to purchase this DVD. It skips. Very disappointed. Otherwise, would rate movie 5 stars.
B004EC5IUW|5.0|Let me start out by saying that this film is just incredible. Dare I say...perfect? Yes I'd go as far as to call it the quintessence of perfection. I was absolutely blown away watching this. When a film can leave you feeling the same emotions of excitement and thrill that riding a roller coaster gives you, you know you're either crazy or it's just that GOOD. Hopefully it's the latter rather than the former. But being completely serious...this film is just ASTOUNDING in it's own right.     The film starts off right where the last one (Evangelion 1.11 You Are (Not) Alone) ends, but in truth it skips episode 07 of the televised series so episode 08 and continues from there to episode 19. Now since this film was released I've picked up the first film mentioned above and loved it, it was enough for me to pre-order Evangelion 2.22 You Can (Not) Advance and also purchase the complete original series. What this film brings to the table is a mix of some new and refreshing plot with a mix of the classic Neon Genesis Evangelion storyline which isn't a bad thing. The film weaves the new story it's trying to tell with the old and does so in a way that makes it feel familiar while still being new and just as exciting.      There's several additions to the Evangelion universe that they add in the film. One such addition is the new Eva pilot Mari who makes a great addition at that. The best way to describe her is well...crazy, but a good crazy she's just a blast to watch piloting and the scenes that do include her feel upbeat and fun. Let's just say she enters the story with a bit of a bang. Also the film changes some aspects that were pivotal in the series. For instance several new Eva's enter in the film while still being true to the series. The film also introduces Asuka Langley Shikinami, her surname changed from Soryu for some reason, but it's never clear why. Other than that not much changes between the main pilots from the original series which are: Shinji, Asuka, and Rei. The only exception is Toji is no longer selected as a pilot, which you'll later see why. Asuka is still the same old self-centered person who can't be honest with herself and her feelings, Shinji still needs a reason(s) to pilot the Eva and deal with his father complex, and Rei is still a mystery in her own right who needs help feeling emotions in my opinion. Between those 3 just like in the original show you have the tsundere (love hate) relationship between Asuka towards Shinji and the underlying relationship between Shinji and Rei the latter of which is more emphasized in this film rather than in the series where you have a lot of attention being focused on Asuka and Shinji.    There's some minor changes to the film as well with the enemies or Angels that they face off against. For instance in the series the episode 09 \\"Both of You, Dance Like You Want to Win!\\", where you have Asuka and Shinji working together to take out an angel that has the ability to separate it's core into two. Instead you have a somewhat similar ending to the fight in the way that the Eva attacks the lone Angel which does not split it's core and looks completely different from what the series depicted. But you also have some similar Angels such as an Angel attempting to crush Nerv HQ by dropping itself from orbit which would vaporize Tokyo-III. Other than that there isn't much change to the Angels they face except for the last one before the film ends. There's a lot that feels new to this film that makes it stand out while still retaining the original NGE story feel.     Another great aspect of the film is the voice acting, now I've watched the original series in the English dub and really liked the voices. A few have changed and some aren't for the better such as Kaji's voice which in my opinion doesn't suit him at all. But those that are present a lot in the film such as the pilots, their voice acting is spot on. The actors really came through with delivering each line making the full emotion they're trying to portray evident in the way they inflict each line. This ties into what I said about it being a roller coaster thrill ride to watch because the actors carry you through the film with such emotion that it gets you excited, or makes you feel whatever each particular scene is trying to convey.    Now the film itself is also in my opinion just completely beautiful. The colors, the artwork, the environments, heck even watching an Evangelion run through the city is just amazing to watch. And I mean that last part, watching the simple animation of an Evangelion running was just spectacular. And it should be the development for these films is top notch and a great and honest homage to the series that it rebuilds.    So from here my suggestion to you would be check it out or do a little digging and see for yourself. FUNimation has a channel on YouTube where they've posted about 8 clips of Evangelion 2.22 in HD of certain scenes in the movie. I've watched all of them and they range from anywhere to 2 minutes to 9 minutes. Even still you won't be spoiling much watching those, they really give you a sense of what the film has to offer without spoiling the plot. I still was surprised as to what happens even after watching Clip 6 *hint* *hint* it almost made me cry...really. Heck you can even purchase the first film Evangelion 1.11 in Blu-ray for around $10. If you do and you like that one then you'll absolutely love this. Period.     Final words...this film is worth it to any long time standing Neon Genesis Evangelion fan for what it offers and what it does for the series. I personally feel as though I'm watching the televised series for the first time all over again as a kid (or really the full series about a month ago). The film has some minor changes but just enough to make it feel original but yet familiar at the same time. It really invokes a senses of nostalgia. The artwork, animation, voice acting, plot, everything about this film is just spectacular.I would recommend it to anyone even if you're not a fan, I think it'd be enough to turn you into one. So that's my say on the film.
0312330871|5.0|As someone who didn't particularly like reading when growing up (thanks to a 6th grade teacher who required us to read a book and write a book report every week) I have found myself going back and reading the classics I missed out on when I was younger (now 43).  And Then There Were None is am amazing mystery and a wonderful read.  It reads quickly, or maybe it just feels that way because Christie draws you in and holds your attention throughout the entire book.  Truthfully, I had a hard time putting this book down and looked forward to the next chance I had to pick it up again.  If you're looking for an amazing tale that's easy to understand, but hard to put down, this is your book!!!
031603438X|4.0|Richards says,\\"This is the life . Believe it or not I haven't forgotten any of it.\\"  Hard to believe that he remembers and that James Fox didn't fill in a lot of blanks.  How true is this??  You be the judge.  Some of it very funny, some very very interesting and lots extremely drug-dangerous things.  Drugs helped make this man no doubt, but it was intense.  Some one wrote, don't your kids read this and get the wrong ideas.  But this book was over all worth the read, interesting history on the man, the Stones, and the scene.

B002JVWR9U|5.0|Being a vampire and specially a Buffy fanatic I hadn't been able to find a story even close as good as Buffy was, with all the well written characters and a continuous and believable plot. When I first heard of the Vampire Diaries I was esceptical since it was a based on a book story and those tend to be a little hard on me because usually what happens is that I like the book but hate the movie or tv show (yes, I'm not a Twilight fanatic). I never saw this on TV because of this fact but when I bought the Buffy complete series I decided to give this a try and I will never regret it! I'm just in love with Damon(bad boy lover!) and his sarcastic yet very fun ways and with the whole story, it is so good that I watched the 5 discs in one single day an was ready to continue with season 2 that is on air right now.
B0048IMZMG|2.0|Well, I gotta say, this recent release doesn't hold a candle to previous work Swift has done, including the past pop triumphs. This album takes her clever and nicely crafted songwriting and completely drowns all the lyrics in awful, repetitive pop sound. And I mean repetitive. Yes, there are some concessions: a slow beat song or two, a 3/4-time song. But mostly it's the boom-chukka of commercial pop 4/4 time, reinforced by synth, that takes over and sweeps this collection up, up, and away from the listener's sensibilities.    This is not the fault of Taylor Swift the songwriter or Taylor Swift the musician. It's the fault of Taylor Swift the producer and the person who should have taken over the reins, kicked her out of the mixing booth, and made this a better set of recordings: her co-producer Nathan Chapman. What was he thinking? Some pop artists actually do have the kind of talent that moves them forward from being a singer-songwriter into arranging and producing, but if Swift has that talent it's not on show here. Maybe next time. Chapman is all over this album as a multi-instrumental musician and producer, so I'm really laying this at his feet.    I'm sure this effort will make Swift money and will be welcomed by her fan base. It's just a fact of life that once you're a star it can take a long list of not-so-good releases before the kiddies who spend the money desert you. But because I like Swift's work, especially her songwriting, and I've happily listened to her previously released collections, I sure hope she and Chapman can find their way out of this thicket!    Sorry!
B000FC1LOC|5.0|i couldn't put this book down  Its an easy read but keeps you guessing  I loved it for its passion  This is my first Jodi Picoult, but wont be my last!
B003L20IFQ|1.0|The reviews were so good I thought I would go against my better judgement. Yet so boring. A film with one actor and no action. Even fast forwarding it still made it boring. Worse than watching cricket.
B004EC5IV6|5.0|I had the honor of both watching and writing a review for Evangelion 1.01: You Are (Not) Alone, and I went into 2.22 thinking I was getting more of the same. I was wrong! 2.22 is still fresh in my mind after having just finished watching it, and the movie was so epic, my mind cannot even begin to wrap itself around the technicalities of what it just witnessed. But I'll try my best    The film starts out with a battle between Eva Unit 05 and and the skeleton of the Third Angel. This fight in no way sets you up for the grand festival the other battles provide, but it's a nice intro for Mari, Unit 05's pilot. You'll notice that Mari's personality bares a strong resemblance to Asuka's in the original build. It'll be a while before you see her again.    Soon after your thrown into one of the greatest displays of character introduction you will ever see, Asuka and Unit 02 arriving to battle the Seventh Angel. Asuka manages to not only beat the Angel single handedly, but she does it in the flashiest way possible, with a piercing dropkick that pierces the Angels core. She does all this while free falling!     I'll take a break from talking about the fights, and talk a little about the characters. Asuka is very antisocial in this film. It's so bad in fact, she could be compared to Rei of the original build. Deep down she wants the connection with others, which is confirmed when she enters Shinji's room one night and sleeps beside him, but is unable to except the bonds that are built when you connect with others. She doesn't even have an infatuation with Kaji. She later calls Misato just because she felt like talking, and the two bond. The moment leads into a terrible encounter for Asuka.    Rei in this film is just a 180 from the Rei in the original build. She actually cares about people and the bonds she creates with them. So much so, she plans a dinner party so that Shinji and Gendo could be happy while they sit and enjoy dinner together. She even at one point in a failedattempt, tries to sacrifice herself so that Shinji wouldn't have to be a pilot anymore.    Shinji, who has developed into quit the pilot, is still seeking approval from his father. For a while, it seemed he had succeeded, but he soon realizes that Gendo is more concerned with seeing his ambitions come to fruition than he is in accepting his son. I can't fully wrap my mind around Gendo, at times he seems to genuinely care about both Shinji and Rei, but other times he's very cold toward them both.    All this leads up to the final confrontation of the film, the battle against the Tenth Angel. Now this is where the raw epicness of the film really shines through, as Unit 02, piloted by Mari, engages the Angel only to have her attacks be deemed useless. She then unleashes Unit 02 beserker mode only to still be easily defeated. Rei shows up in an attempt to defeat the Angel using a N2 missile, and in doing so, keeps Shinji from having to pilot Unit 01. She fails and is consumed by the Angel. Mari comes across Shinji and Shinji rushes back to NERV so he can pilot Unit 01. Shinji manages to both defeat the Angel and save Rei after Unit 01 transcends the boundaries of man. This starts the 3rd impact, but it is halted after Unit 06, piloted by Kaworu, impales Unit 01 with the Lance of Longinus.    I gave away some of the plot in the review, but I left alot of information out. Evangelion 2.22 takes everything you know about the original build, and throws it out the window. It takes this rebuild in a direction all it's on, while still remembering it's established and legendary roots. This film is both beautiful and tragic, paving the way for this franchise to be known for it's cinematic greatness. When I said I almost cried, I wasn't joking. This is the must see film of the year, and I don't know what's more tragic, what Asuka continually goes through in the world of Evangelion, or the fact that this film will never reach the kind of acclaim it rightfully deserves.
B000002H33|5.0|Master of Puppets was the album where Metallica matured into a true world-class talent, the one where they realized their full potential within the thrash genre.  They stuck with it for one more album, And Justice For All, but that release is generally not considered to be as strong.  Consequently, they changed their style on The Black Album, seeing nothing left to accomplish within the boundaries of thrash.  Considering how amazing Master of Puppets is, it's easy to understand their reasoning.<br /><br />Thrash produced some legendary bands, including Slayer, Megadeth, Anthrax, Testament, Overkill, Exodus, and many others.  Still, Master of Puppets had them all beat in the most important categories.  Best riffs, best vocals, best solos.  They had the most complicated song structures of any of the other bands, the biggest sound.  Sure, Slayer put out Reign In Blood that year, one of my all-time favorite albums, but Puppets just had that high-level musicianship and professionalism to go with the aggression and brutality.  James lost his high-pitched scream for a more controlled, gruff, serious approach, and the lyrics took on more serious topics like cocaine addiction, mental instability, the tragic ironies of military service, and religious hypocrisy.  The sound of the songs was darker and more brooding than on their first two albums, more angry; it had more focus and direction.  It rightfully launched Metallica into the stratosphere, and regardless of where they took their sound later, it still holds up today as a timeless metal classic.<br /><br />I'm sure most of what I've offered has been said before, but that just establishes the fact that this album's greatness is common knowledge.  Obviously, its inclusion in any metal collection is essential.

B001EOOQEC|5.0|The most important thing to know about Dehumanizer is this;  every song on the album is a legitimate Black Sabbath classic, making this one of the band's several overlooked gems.<br /><br />This album is a throwback in some ways, and a progression in others.  Bringing back Dio and Appice alone makes it a throwback, but so do a couple other things.  One is that they stripped down to the core elements, eliminating keyboards and lengthy acoustic passages for straightforward, hard-hitting heavy metal/hard rock songs.  Iommi's Sabbath albums after Mob Rules went in a lot of directions, but these songs feature good old-fashioned heavy riffs, pounding beats, and amazing solos.<br /><br />Despite the return of some old-school elements, Dehumanizer can also be seen as a step forward because the sound is newer and in many cases very close to that of Heaven and Hell's 2009 album, The Devil You Know.  In fact, if you listen to Mob Rules, then Dehumanizer, then The Devil You Know, it's a fairly seamless progression.  Over the years, the Deep Purple influence that found its way onto the first Dio-fronted albums was gradually filtered out of Iommi's playing by the passage of time, and it's barely present on this release, with the excellent Time Machine being about the only song with that sound.  TV Crimes, Time Machine, Master of Insanity, and Too Late sound the closest to the two older albums, while all the remaining tracks blend perfectly with The Devil You Know.  These are all great songs, with highlights that include After All's slow, doomy riff reminiscent of the song Black Sabbath; the stomper I, which sounds like one of the heavier tracks off The Devil You Know; and Too Late, an epic-sounding song worthy of the first two Dio-fronted albums.<br /><br />Dehumanizer is great, blending styles from Sabbath's early, mid, and late-80's releases.  You even hear some traces of the Tony Martin era, and the last song, Buried Alive, features a riff that would be right at home on Born Again.  For the most part though, this is more of a headbanging album than a fist-pumping one, an album that sees Iommi take Sabbath in a heavier direction than the previous few.  Just like the Heaven and Hell band, this album offers great mid-80's style metal/hard rock songs with a modern groove sensibility, and should be listened to if you're a fan of any of the music mentioned in this review.rt though, this is more of a headbanging album than a fist-pumping one, an album that sees Iommi take Sabbath in a heavier direction than the previous few.

The photography and the stories are beautiful and I will enjoy these inspiring movies many times. Needless to say, Amazon is great at getting my orders right and to my house on time everytime.

B00457X7XQ|5.0|I've read several well know cyber-thrillers that left me disappointed - either gross technical inaccuracies, completely implausible, or just bad writing.<br /><br />Zero Day IS plausible, IS technically accurate, and IS a great read, as many reviewers (on Amazon and off) have already stated.<br /><br />Yes, I've coauthored books with Mark, so you might say I'm biased, but this is a book you won't want to put down.  I enjoyed reading the final draft as much as I did an early draft.
0062004352|2.0|It's hard to write a good book.  Unfortunately it's not hard to get a book published.      You can have no writing talent whatsoever but if you pick the write subject matter (currently vampires, Jane Austen knockoffs or anything set in New York) someone will publish you figuring that they can make money off the subject matter.  This book is a good example of that.    The premise was good and the writing was better than a lot of what's out there but to be able to pull off a fairy tale like this you have to have something else to offer to make the suspension of disbelief possible and enjoyable and this writer failed miserably.    The book was riddled with flaws that any basic writing course would warn against, starting with the fact that there was no character development.    I kept waiting to get a sense of who Angela really was and by the time I finished the book all I got was that deep down she was really shallow.    People on both sides of the Atlantic kept falling all over themselves to give her things and do things for her but for the life of me I couldn't figure out why.  She didn't appear to give anything back and her feelings for other people (including her own parents) seemed to depend on whether or not they were doing what she wanted them to.    The book lacked any kind of descriptions that would set the mood and make it fun.  The endless shopping for instance read like a mall directory because all that the author did was mention labels she never described the clothes.    The same goes with the staggering amount of junk food that they all consumed (even the guys).  Instead of being every woman's fantasy (calorie free chocolate) it just read like a menu and it very quickly got tedious.    There are authors who manage to write highly improbable and highly enjoyable chick lit.  The late Olivia Goldsmith, Katie Fforde, and Lisa Jewell are all good examples.  I don't believe that a book has to be Pullitzer prize winning literature to be an enjoyable and worthwhile read but it should have some respect for the readers intelligence.
0061537969|5.0|I absolutely love this book, and it was a life changer.  It reminded me that we (and even dogs!) shape our future by what we see. Enzo, the dog actually taught me a few things and I'm grateful!    This is a wonderful read and one of the cutest books I've read in quite a long time.  I also cried dearly during one of the parts.      I recommend this book, and I hope that someday it will become a movie.  I would be first in line.    It was thoroughly enjoyable.
B004L49K20|5.0|Wow, what a great album!    Like others, I also have been a life long fan of DD, ever since hearing tracks from Rio back in the early `80s. On the album I actually like many of the other songs more than the The All You Need Is now title track with the odd opening sound effect... including Girl Panic!, Too Bad You're So Beautiful, Runway Runaway, Blame The Machines, Man Who Stole A Leopard, Being Followed, Mediterranea, Safe, Leave A Light On, and Other Peoples Lives.    These songs are so good I really regret waiting until the CD came out and not getting it when the digital version was 1st released last December.  So, don't wait any longer, this is definitely worth the purchase!
1439177783|4.0|This book is a memoir by Portia De Rossi a well-known TV actress on Ally McBeal who is currently married to Ellen DeGeneres.  She wrote this book as a history of the eating disorders that plagued her for many years before she met Ms. DeGeneres.  It is not a great book but it is a fascinating insight into the mind of a very talented young woman tortured by weight and food issues.  Through her eyes you come to see how all-consuming such issues are - every moment of her life is focused on weight/measurements/food.  While her successful professional career swirls around her, her low self-esteem and terror of losing control (and of exposure of her sexual orientation) keep her trapped into the dark world of drastic dieting,  binge eating and purging and punishing exercise.  The graphic details of her food restrictions are compelling to read and are evidence of how sick she really was.  Of course, she eventually pushes her body too far and collapses in time to save her health and start the long road to recovery.   She appears to have found happiness in her life by painfully working through her issues and one must admire such openness from this brave young woman.

B004FRX0MY|5.0|Amazon has earned my respect with this app. This isn't the old amazon mp3 player which wasn't bad but nothin special just like itunes with cheaper albums most of the time, but now this is the future of music in my honest opinion. The cloud player service makes this the best thing to happen to music in a long. Now you can upload all your music to there website and have access to all your music without taking up space on your devices anymore. Also great if you like me always have to transfer song from multiple devices now you can just upload or buy from amazon have access to everything instantly from any device that can use the service. Android phone/tablet pc or MAC computer. So you get to keep your music forever unlike itunes one time purchase and goodlook with keep your music safe. See even if you music device fails you instantly have all your music back.  Thanks for making something we always needed.
B002ZG976U|4.0|Saw this movie with no expectations and came out thinking; 'what a great movie'.  Great chick flick (yes I am a guy) with some great dance and song numbers, great actors in the movie and just a feel good movie.  Christina's singing will knock you off your chair as does Cher's.  They work great together.  Get the movie for those rainy nights in and fill up the popcorn bucket....don't forget to invite me along.  It's one of those movies you can watch again and again.
B0042816YK|1.0|OK, I tried, I really, really tried. Lasted 18 minutes of this dreck. Try NEVER to watch a movie where Julia eats. Basically she looks like a horse trying to eat an apple through a wire fence! Her huge mouth is further enhanced by the badly done (upper) lip job that looks smeared now that she's definitely beginning to show age. I never knew what all the hulabaloo about her was about.    And this movie has been done before. It was called \\"Shirley Valentine\\", unhappy for no reason housewife abandons a perfectly good marriage/husband to run away and have an affair. Didn't work for that one, doesn't work here. She whines about going from boyfriend to boyfriend in her early life and never having time for me, me, ME!!!!!!! So what does she do? She goes overseas to go from boyfriend to boyfriend. At least that's what the other reviewers said. I ain't wasting 2 1/2 hours of MY life on this turkey!!!
4770031246|5.0|This is definitely my favorite bento cookbook. It is extensive and creative, with instructions that are easy to follow. The recipes that are so tasty that even someone who doesn't cook much will want to cook them over and over again, showing them off to friends and family. I especially love the style in which this cookbook is done. It is clear and to the point, but it also includes wonderful little bits of information about each recipe, and mouthwatering full page pictures. I would recommend this to anyone even remotely interested in bento lunches, or even just looking for some cooking inspiration. I was impressed by the wonderful range of foods, and the beautiful way in which they are presented. A wonderful introduction to bento!

0515142247|5.0|I say don't read it if you are claustrophobic because Lee Child is such a gifted writer that at one point Reacher is stuck underneath something and is fighting to get out that I was getting claustrophobic...no joke and yes, I know I have issues :) This is only my second Lee Child book and as the first book I thoroughly enjoyed it even with the claustrophobic passage.
B000O178BY|4.0|Nine inch nails have awesome albums as this one. The production is for another time excellent and you can hear industrial music with the correct depth in sound. The tracks gives you a cool <> feeling. This album reminds me The fragile a little bit. The vocals are really great (I love the tone , pitch and the color of his voice) . If you are familiar with Nine inch nails you will probably like this album . Its not a masterpiece but a good one.

B004FHBO9U|5.0|Ryan Adams 2nd solo albumn released on clear vinyl commemorating lost highways 10 year anniversary. Reissue is the original limited edition featuring additional 5 track ep. This is the albumn which brought Ryan Adams to prominenece and commercial success, which is strange, being an anachronistic mix of mid 60's Bakersfield honky tonk, early 70's Stones and mid 80's replacements. Reconstructed, authentic and heartfelt through Adams catchy melodys and songcraft. Long live Rock.
0452286751|4.0|I've heard so many things, both good and bad, about Ayn Rand over the years, that it took me many years to approach any of her works.  As other reviewers have noted, it seems that people tend to idolize her.  After reading this novel, that seems highly ironic to me.    I enjoyed the novel.  I found Wynand to be a fascinating character, fairly nuanced and complex.  Roark, Dominique, and Toohey were perhaps too archetypical to be entirely believable, but to a good extent they had to be portrayed as they were in order for the novel to work.  The struggle between Roark and Toohey and the ideas they represented were, after all, pretty much the whole thrust of the novel.  And though Keating was entirely un-sympathetic, if we were to be honest, he acts in ways that many of us can probably identify with.    Rarely do I find a novel that contains \\"realistic\\" dialogue, and this was no exception, but I actually thought it worked better than what one finds in many novels, because it caught so much of the non-verbal communication that takes place between people--all the gestures, expressions, starts and stops, glances.  So much of \\"real\\" dialogue is unspoken, especially between people who know each other quite well, and I thought Rand did a great job of conveying that.  So I found the dialogue \\"believable\\" in many places, if not exactly \\"realistic\\".    The plot was compelling, as there were times when I had trouble putting the book down.  And I very much enjoyed the fact that I couldn't always see where the plot was going.  Yes, there were times when the plot and/or the dialogue slowed down so Rand could make a philosophical point.  But that comes with the material.    As for the philosophy of objectivism, I don't really agree with it at all; however, I do think Rand makes a number of interesting points in the novel regarding individualism and independence.  Except for a few places towards the end, I didn't feel that the philosophical statements got in the way of the novel.  I could read it as a novel and put the philosophy to the side.    Knowing that I didn't agree with the philosophy, I went into this read thinking that it would be a chore, but in the end, I am happy to have read it.
B000I9WWHW|5.0|Words can't describe the emotion you will feel watching this Movie. I cry every time I watch it. It is visually beautiful and stimulating. This is the best love story you will ever watch. Robin Williams displays his wonderful talent of showing real emotion and he even throws in a joke or two. It is a tragic tale that shows that love has no boundaries.
0316069485|2.0|I really like the series with defense attorney Mickey Haller, but this one was very disappointing.  The plot wanders around and does not include the usualy dramatic build up at the end.  Unfortunately, it sort of just fizzles out.  The author (for some reason) has Haller as a prosecuter in this book...but it does not work very well. I hope that he will go back to the more successful version of this character!
0393078299|5.0|Einstein may have hated Quantum Mechanics because of uncertainty.  For me, I think it's brilliant some people got together and figured out, \\"you know what, there are things we just cannot know all that well.\\" It's amazing to me that humans had to study the atom to know that we can not know everything.  And this is that story.    Though for higher level physics, this probably comes off as quite elementary, for the rest of us it is a gripping slice of history.  There is more to this book than equations - and there are plenty of those.  Quantum is a spirited histo-scientifc text of many things we know, but after reading, we know much better.    Highly recommended, there is not a chapter that isn't overflowing with information and insight on something that, in effect, defined the 20th century.
0670022411|2.0|No doubt I will be slammed but this is a chick lit book lite.  Read the first 50 pages and the last 50.  In between is wine, determining who smells like what, glances, cliches, and iterations.  The plot is onion skin thin.  There just have to be better books out there.  And I did read it through but only because I am stubborn but you really can skim through this one  Hopefully the movie will be short.

B0038M2AZA|5.0|This review may never be read, among so many others, but I must get in my 5 stars. Claire Danes is nothing short of magnificent in her portrayal of this very complicated, very misunderstood person, who was treated so badly by many and had only the best intentions. Excellent support from Julia Ormond, David Straitairn and Catherine O'Hara. Temple's amazing insight is well-examined, and I can't believe that designing a cattle slaughterhouse could be so very entertaining. Her concept of death was so complete, but the concept of living was so confusing to her. I can relate...
B0034G4OUO|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie. Although I am no fan of The Rock, I really enjoyed his portrayal of a man seeking justice / revenge for the killing of his brother. He and Billy Bob Thornton acted quite well together. The movie was very realistic.

B004SS0884|5.0|Femme Fatale is Britney Spears' best album since \\"In The Zone\\". Circus was good, but isn't even comparable. You HAVE to get the deluxe set though, because it's really makes the album so amazing. Track by track here we go!    1. Till the World ends- No need to explain. 10/10  2. Hold it Against me- EPIC. 10/10  3. Inside Out-  Sexual break-up song. Love the references to her old hits \\"hit me one more time it's so amazing\\" 9/10  4. I Wanna Go- Fun dance song; gets stuck in your head and will have you dancing all day. 10/10  5. How I Roll- If you need a song for a saturday night on your way to the club with friends this is it. 8/10  6. (Drop Dead) Beautiful- Another hot dance track with an interesting rap. 8/10  7. Seal it With a Kiss- Oooo Oooo weee Oooo two words very sexy.10/10  8. Big Fat Bass- The worst song on the album. Very repetitive and hard to listen to. Sorry no way around that. 2/10  9. Trouble for Me- Interesting beat. Futuristic sound love this one. 10/10  10. Trip to Your Heart- It reminds me of a updated Britney from 1999 the lyrics are a lot like \\"Born to Make You Happy\\", \\"Deep In My Heart\\", and \\"I Will Be There\\". It's nice. 9/10  11. Gasoline- Hot club song 8/10  12. Criminal- So different from everything else on the album it really stands out. Any teenaged girl would love this. 10/10  13. Up N' Down- No question the most danceable song on the album! 10/10  14. He About to Loose Me- Beautiful break-up song. 10/10  15. Selfish- Fun song good for a hot night. 9/10  16. Don't Keep Me Waiting- Britneys' rock song and it's nothing less than amazing. Very No Doubt. 10/10

B004NSULHM|3.0|I'll keep this short .. I read most of the <4* comments and i agree largely with what was said .. Ignoring the hate speech found in some 1* reviews.    This is a very strange, inward, experimental album at the very best.. Yet, you can hear the Radiohead's creative tour de force in compositions like Codex, a true masterpiece that somehow feels borrowed from another album of theirs .. The last 2 compositions after Codex, yes, they are good but nothing to touch Codex - it's standing as the only serious achievement here.. It's just that good ..    My 'angry' questions :    1. Why compositions like \\"Lift\\" never saw the light ? Why ? It could have been No 9 in this rushed delivery attempt, lightening up things   2. Why couldn't Radiohead write what Deerhunter (a band i discovered this month) has been writing for years and recently - to me they sound wonderful and where i imagined Radiohead to go ?  3. Why no complex arrangements and why only Thom on vocals throughout ?  4. WTF does \\"King of Limbs\\" supposed to tell / convey / hide / symbolize - methaphorize ?  5. Is the group falling apart ? This sounds like a solo Thom Yorke at the very best ? Is this a drum machine throughout or what ?    Yet, kudos for the exceptional Codex - and it is very far from pop and easy digestion, at least for the text and the key changes    Common guys .. You can do much better

B004LFO0ME|5.0|Lotta people say wiz is losin it, but really this album shows alot of his talent. There are hardcore songs, strong lyric songs, and soft, country like songs. My favorite songs on the album are \\"When I'm Gone\\", \\"Fly Solo\\", and \\"No Sleep\\". There's prolly only like one song thats not good, but other than that they all are really good and definitely recommend buying it

B002QH2NUA|5.0|My wife and daughters gave me this as a gift for my birthday. Wonderful. The great thing about this show and video is that McCartney nicely weaves in Wings music and Beatles music from his entire career pretty seamlessly with an updated modern sound. For anyone who's a fan of McCartney and Beatles music, it's like seeing the whole thing in a fresh new re-incarnation. Pretty cool! The band is tight enough that they can do the old Beatles music in the orignal sound and add a new twist.  There's plenty of energy too. It brings home what an amazing talent and entertainer this guy, in his simple manner, really is. Definitely worth it!

I'm not talking about literal super powers or magic, but it's close. Thoughts are really powerful and you attract what you think about.

B002ZCY7SW|4.0|The first five seasons of 24 remain, in this reviewer's opinion, the gold standard of the series in terms of intelligence, creativity, casting and emotional resonance; arguably the most riveting television ever. I gave them all five stars. These were very much the product of writer, co-creator and self-described Hollywood right-winger Joel Surnow and were adept at reversing liberal expectations, for example providing a villainous-and black- First Lady, and imposing agonizing choices on their protagonists. When Surnow's full time commitment ended following the masterful fifth season the franchise shed a dozen or so IQ points. But 24 still scored as more entertaining than your average fare thanks to the compelling format he devised with Robert Cochran and the always reliable Kiefer Sutherland.    Critics and many fans considered Season 6, featuring Jack Bauer's pathological family, a misfire. The chastened producers were determined to right the ship and the first half of Season 7, set in Washington DC, re-captured some of the old magic (Surnow agreed to return as exec-producer for the fist eight episodes) before entropy set in and the show collapsed into terminal silliness (those ridiculous missiles!).     Season 8, now re-located to New York City, starts lethargically but generates considerable electricity as it builds. CTU resurfaces in a whiz-bang setting and Sutherland contributes a driving performance, some say to the point of stepping out of character and damaging the Bauer brand in his character's quest for vengeance. The season makes little use of NYC exteriors but that doesn't much matter as the bulk of the action plays out in U.N. offices, murky parking structures, warehouses and behind the tinted windows of SUVs. Demands are placed on the viewer's credulity (the early seasons sold these improbabilities better) and plot warhorses stampede again, e.g. 'the mole', but you'll end up glued to the screen over the final ten episodes. Get ready for '24: The Movie'.So,    S1-5 *****  S6 ***  S7 ***  S8 ****

I  DO NOT BELIEVE THAT BELLA'S PREGNANCY WAS VERY WELL EXPLAINED SINCE HER HUSBAND WAS NOT SUPPOSE TO ABLE TO FATHER CHILDREN SINCE HE IS A VAMPIRE, AND  AS  BELLA IS HUMAN, I DO NOT BELIEVE  SHE WOULD BE ABLE TO SUFFER WHAT SHE SUFFERED TO CARRY EDWARD'S BABY  UNTIL IT WAS DELIVERED.    BUT THESE ARE MINOR COMPLAINTS, I GREATLY ENJOYED THE BOOK AND WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE WHO ENJOY A GOOD LOVE STORY.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Awesome voice...very infectious...a total enjoyable listening experience. Heard of her on a T.V. show...heard her perform and had to have her latest album! Am enjoying her in the car, on my computer and at home! Best buy ever!
0061150142|5.0|The book came in a timely matter. It also came in the condition it said in the description. Thanks! :)
0061020680|5.0|...and it got me totally hooked on Sir Terry. There is not much I can say here about this particular book that has not already been said, so instead I will offer some blatant generalizations. :)    First off, whenever I discover an avid reader who has not yet read any Pratchett, I am jealous. I am jealous because I have read nearly everything he has written, and they get to experience it all for the very first time. His books are wondrous: effortlessly funny, and not at all like some \\"funny\\" books whose storyline seems to merely exist as a setup for puns and pratfalls. And not only are they funny, but Terry has a deep insight into human nature, and a unique way of pointing out all those little foibles to which we are all susceptible. He allows us to see ourselves in his characters, and laugh while we are doing so.     A couple of quotes come to mind, and while I do not have them in front of me, this is the gist of them, and I promise I am not mangling them TOO badly. The first is \\"If Terry Pratchett had started out first, Douglas Adams would not have bothered to set pen to paper.\\"  The second is \\"Terry is like the wisest, kindest, and funniest teacher you can imagine.\\"    I know these are strong claims, but if you are an avid reader, and have not yet read him, pick up a book. Any book. (But try to find the ones with the footnotes. Ironically, it seems some of the books published in the UK do not have them.)     Every avid reader I have \\"turned on\\" to Pratchett has either blessed me or cursed me. But, for the same reason. They found that after the first book, they had an insatiable appetite for a new author.

B004I2K4DY|5.0|This is the most awesome DVD I have seen in some time.  The quality of the music is only outdone by the quality and heart of the voices of these talented singers.  Norm Lewis is awesome as Javert, and Lea Salonga's voice is so sincere and dripping with talent.  I pretty much sat with my mouth agape for the entire production.  This is some of the best music currently available.  Everyone should listen to this DVD.   WOW!!!!!
B000PAU032|1.0|The 30 second preview for each track isn't enough.  This is not a grouping of soundtracks from Zimmer's films.  These are orchestrations for the City of Prague Orchestra, and what a waste!  One of the things that I find most exciting about Hans Zimmer is his virtuosity.  He is known for his original themes for the different films he has taken on and along with that are HIS orchestrations.  That is what makes it Zimmer.  Prague, I found out the hard way, orchestrates all kinds of film music from past to present.  They never use the original orchestrations, only their own.  Now that I have 20+ tracks from this CD I can recognize Prague's sound.  It is as distinctive as Goldsmith's, Korngold's or Zimmer's.  One must understand that one is buying the City of Prague Orchestra, not an original soundtrack.      If one just wants some nice orchestral background music Prague's stuff is the CD to buy.  It is a cut above elevator music, but not by much.  If you want the originals read very carefully all of the notes in the presentation for the CD along with customer reviews.  Good hunting.

030746363X|5.0|I've read reviews on here, good and bad.  All I can offer is my experience.    I've been doing the Four Hour Body diet plan for three months.  I have also been using PAGG (supplementation described in the book).  I have followed the book fairly close, although I don't eat beans to the extent he suggests.  I focus on other low and slow carb foods and zero carb protein shakes for six days, then one day of pig out where I eat whatever I feel like.  I also had a vacation in this three month period where I was off the diet and pigged out for three days.  One month into the diet, of for the last two months, I started slow-paced running (couch to 5k; Google it if you're interested).  NOTE: I was losing weigh before the running, so it is not just due to the running.  And I've only recently built up to 3 miles.    I have lost 35 lbs and have gained muscle in the process.    Follow what you'd like in the book; disregard what you'd like.  The author says this right from the beginning.  He does not suggest that you have to read each chapter in detail and follow it all.  So I didn't.  And I've found success, and have stayed on a diet longer than I ever have before.      Nothing works for everyone.  This works for me.  Other plans can be as effective...you just have to find what works for you.  Four Hour Body has been my answer.
B000002O1P|2.0|Being neither a yankee nor a reb but enamored of american \\"roots\\" music, Tom Petty (with or without) and the Heartbreakers remain maddeningly uneven. Petty obviously aspires to be the bard of traditional heart land America but doesn't quite make it .<br />Some good songs but the majority of the songs are lack lustre and he tries so hard to catch something \\"southern\\" but it is all too obvious...imitation without conviction.

B000VDDDY6|5.0|Outstanding job by the folks who did the remastering! Obviously a labor of love. The enhancement of the special effects look great, without being overpowering.<br />The only grumble is that the inner case actually holding the dvds somehow had some small broken pieces on each season set. Fortunately, that didn't damage the discs.<br />Definitely my favorite dvd set!

B0043RSJ8G|5.0|I wasn't so sure about this book when I first started reading it, by half way I was amazed, by the end of the book I loved it. Amazing book, great characters, just amazing. One of the best books by Jodi Picoult.
0307593495|5.0|I heard that this is Henning Mankell's last Kurt Wallender novel, and it looks like it's true. While I've loved all of his books that I've read, and still have some to go, I like Wallander best. And best of all is Before the Frost, in which his daughter Linda becomes a police officer and they solve a crime together. I enjoyed this book because Linda is also featured, starting her own family. The story starts out pretty ordinary, Wallander is invited to meet Linda's new in-laws. The father is a retired submarine commander, but at his 75th birthday celebration he tells Wallander a strange story that happened 25 years before, when the Soviet Union still existed and was a threat to other countries in the Baltic region. He also behaves as if he's being stalked, and Wallander sees a suspicious man in the parking lot. Not long after, the father-in-law disappears. No one can tell if he is dead or alive, has been abducted or disappeared on his own. The answers must lie in the distant past, and one strange event or revelation after another occur. I don't want to give away the plot, either, but I find this book something like solving a jigsaw puzzle. I also like the way Mankell takes us inside Wallender's mind. He's now 60 years old and becoming not just forgetful, but blacking out for short periods of time, which naturally has him worried. He's had to take leave for various reasons, which gives him time to look into the matter of Linda's in-laws. The case is being investigated by the police in Stockholm, and Wallander really has no business interfering in it, other than as a family member. His memory lapses have already gotten him in trouble with the police department in Ystad. I don't know if I should mention this, because I have an advance reading copy, but in the book I read I noticed several inconsistencies in the timing of events. These may have been fixed. The only other thing that may detract from the book for American readers is that the author assumes you know a lot about Swedish politics and government. I just accept whatever he says, the book is way too good to put down. It's nice to think that maybe Linda's new daughter Klara will make the third generation of police officers in the Wallander family.about Swedish politics and government.

0374290024|4.0|I gave this book a high mark because it articulates its position well. The lay reader will have little or no ability to critically assess the view of world history which takes up a large part of the book (it's a great read and informative) so you have to some extent to accept the interpretation put on the historical record. What is that position? it relies heavily on a materialistic view of the drivers of human society to the extent of stating that every society gets the thought it needs (hence religion sprang from a structural deficiency within society, not as a result of any self-generated human search for meaning). Cultural outputs are also treated as by-products of the factors driving (or retarding) human development. individuals as a whole do not feature strongly in this story.    The book focuses on societies as a whole and the dynamics of their interactions with other groups on their borders. social development is a two-edged sword. it improves living standards, but the increased complexity of advanced societies makes them vulnerable to attack and inflexible in their response to non-human challenges (such as climate change). Aggression towards others is inevitable because societies must deliver continuous improvements in living standards to maintain cohesion and often the easiest way to generate increased returns is through conquest. Social reverses are inevitable in the authors eyes unless there is an exceptional confluence of factors. The risks of a catastrophic social decline following a failure to break through the next social development ceiling ( a key concept in the book) are exacerbated by the power of the weapons of aggression available to us and the fact that there are no longer any empty lands to conquer.    There are lots of  positives. The book is written in a very accessible style. Its exceptional in the timescale that it attempts to cover and gives a vivid sense of how exceptional our own epoch is. The way attitudes towards the central questionhave been shaped by ideology and scientific discovery is an interesting story on its own. However, the author sometimes goes too far in his efforts to appeal to a non-expert readership. The last section is about forecasting the future and is perhaps the most unconvincing as it seeks to suggest how the human race (which the author has characterised as selfish and lazy) finds a meaningful response to the challenges of climate change and nuclear technology. It seems to call for a human capacity to act for the greater good which is not evident in the rest of the book.
B004L3AQFG|5.0|He's been on a roll ever since 2002's [[ASIN:B000VDDWEC 28 Days Later]], and Danny Boyle has done it again. Another excellent movie. But this time you have to give James Franco a lot of the credit, because after all...127 Hours really is a one man show.<br /><br />127 Hours is a true story. As the title of mountain climber Aron Ralston's autobiography suggests, he literally gets himself stuck [[ASIN:074349282X Between a Rock and a Hard Place]]. If you're not already familiar with Ralston's story, don't be mislead by the 127 Hours promotional poster or DVD cover that shows what you're supposed to assume is Ralston stuck without a rope high above the ground with only a small boulder between him and a fall to his death. Oh there is indeed a small boulder involved in Ralston's plight, but it is not helping him in any way, shape or form.<br /><br />If you're looking for more than a story about perseverance, strength and character, you may be in the wrong place. Sure there is some beautiful scenery in 127 Hours, and a small amount of dialogue, but what 127 Hours is really about is one man's will to live and the torturous 5 day episode that will lead to survival or certain death. Sound boring? I kinda thought so. But the reviews suggested otherwise as did the award nominations. Not that award nominations guarantee anything, and there are certain critics that I often disagree with, but the award nominations were justified and the critics are right about 127 Hours. Danny Boyle and James Franco have created a masterpiece here. The movie is well directed and Franco's performance made me feel like I was an ant on a boulder watching Ralston's ordeal as it was actually happening.<br /><br />127 Hours is the best movie I've seen in a long time. Check it out or take a hike; just watch out for the loose boulders if you choose the latter.
0316044938|4.0|I'm wavering between three and four stars.  I had to go with four because I did \\"like it.\\"  Maybe I have a high tolerance for this kind of thing. But I read a few of the very critical reviews and had to agree with many of the points they made.      I think any prospective reader should read a sampling of all of the reviews to determine whether she will like it.  I suspect it will appeal more to women than to men.      There are many things that I could pick at:  the cliches of the \\"naughty but really swell teenagers' who are all smarter than their teachers and smoke and have sex at an early age, although this is supposed to be a suburb in the early 70's so I find the latter activity somewhat unlikely.  We're given very clear indications of who we're supposed to like and who to dislike--not much ambiguity here except for the mother who leaves her family after the daughter's death.  She could have been a much more interesting character if we knew more of what motivated her to leave and what she actually did in her absence.  We see that she \\"wants more than being a mother' and she reads French books!  But is that enough for her to abandon her loving husband and two still young children? I didn't find it convincing. We're given some hints of the problems in her family of origin that might have contributed to her instability but something was lacking for me.    I could pick at some other things.  Most of the sympathetic characters are either racial minorities or social misfits, which srikes me as unrealistic and actually insulting to both groups.  The Indian woman is practically a saint, gorgeous, and makes a mean apple pie.  Why did her husband stray?  Maybe because she secretly snuck in a cigarette out behind the house, something that is supposed to further endear her to us. argh    Actually the more I write here, the less I like the book and I may have to lower my original rating to three stars.  However, there are some lovely scenes and the overall idea of showing the effects of a child's death on a family is admirable.  I had a sister who died at 12 and the effects on our family were unmistakable, not the least of which was the strain on the relationship of our parents.      I listened to the audio book which was read by the author and I found her voice to be drab and uninviting.  I think I would like the movie better mostly for the presence of a young actress who could better portray the heroine, Suzie, than a mature woman.     There is great tenderness in many of the scenes of the relationships between the young people but they do border on sentimentality.  Again I think this book will appeal to people of a certain sensibility and will repell others.

B000QFAJ7S|5.0|I never ever listen to an artist that I cannot relate to personally. For example, britney spears gives me no inspiration because she lip syncs, and doesnt write any of the music she sings, except for a couple songs. But Kelly Clarkson's album My December showed me just what a true artist is all about. No, the album isn't perfect to everyone but it's perfect to people like me who respect what music is all about. This album was raw, and real and something I have never heard before. It doesn't go along with the trends of other artists, but it stands out and it's amazing and such a shame people never gave it the credit it deserved. My favorite song on this album is Maybe. Its a song I can relate to the most saying I'm not perfect, I have flaws but I wouldn't change who I am just because someone else doesn't accept it. This album is beautifully written and I am proud of Kelly for creating what it to me, a masterpiece.

B000UX6THK|5.0|I recently purchased this Gold edition of Twin Peaks. I have watched the entire series many times, but each time I watch it again, it always seems fresh and original. Maybe I'm watching the wrong shows on TV these days, but I simply don't think anything that has been produced before Twin Peaks or after it comes close to its multi-layered effect. I simply can't recall another show that can achieve intense levels of humor, mystery, intrigue, horror, innocence, elements of the supernatural, and an uncanny ability to turn your stomach at certain points. This show was cut short early for a reason - mainstream TV watchers simply can't handle it. It was revolutionary when it aired and still would be today. If you haven't seen it, you just don't know what you're missing.

0446195529|4.0|Lots of action here, good fast paced action...Am going to read the entire series (five books in all, as of \\"Hell's Corner\\")starting today, as in right now!!!    Not having read any of the earlier \\"Camel Club\\" books had no effect whatsoever on my ability to enjoy and get absorbed in this novel..It's good, very good.    Oliver Stone(aka John Carr) is right up there with Vince Flynn's Mitch Rapp in keeping the country safe through cunning, heroic action, and skill.  Baldacci knows how to tell a good story with intriguing twists and turns.  Good stuff. Real good stuff.    Again, don't let the fact that you haven't read any other \\"Camel Club\\" books keep you from trying this one.  Try itand you'll like it.   Good, fast escape reading here, and provocative, too.
B004IFYMWK|3.0|A complex story already which they have tried to make more suspenseful with the introduction of a subplot surrounding nuclear scientists in Iraq. It's interesting to see the effects of this story on the personal lives of the Wilsons but generally this movie doesn't add anything more than is already known ... and actually is hard to follow if you don't know the story.
1846144132|5.0|\\"A History of the World in 100 Objects\\" began with a BBC Radio 4 program that described 100 striking objects housed in the British Museum in London. I encountered the \\"100 Objects\\" while visiting the museum in the summer of 2010, and I was delighted to learn several months later that the original radio scripts were being adapted into a book.<br /><br />The result, as author Neil MacGregor reminds us, is simply \\"a\\" history of the world rather than \\"the\\" history.  Each chapter tells the story of a unique object or set of objects, ranging from a hand axe and chopping tools that are more than a million years old through the modern credit card and a solar-powered lamp and charger.  Some of the objects are famous, some are obscure, but each inspires its own intriguing story.  Chapter by brief chapter, the book carefully and clearly describes each object, places it in its historical context, and explains what it meant (or may have meant) to the people who created, used or admired it.<br /><br />The UK edition of the book is quite elegant--nearly 700 pages of high-quality paper with numerous striking color photographs showing each object from multiple vantage points. It makes a fine gift for friends and family who appreciate art, or history, or both, and it deserves pride of place on any bookshelf.<br /><br />As an aside, for those interested in the original BBC Channel 4 Radio program that inspired the book, you can download each of the 100 original broadcasts on iTunes.  They make a marvelous companion to the book.
0375701427|1.0|Against my better judgment, I began to read it - at the urging of a friend - who wanted me to explain it to her. Previously, I had worked with her on reading Proust and again on reading Faulkner.    I regret the time I spent on the first 80 pages before I threw it away. Roth's Pulitzer Prize winner is wordy, whiny, deadly.
B003Y5H50G|1.0|I regret seeing Limitless! The violence is excessive and disturbing. PG-13 doesn't mean very much anymore! The current movie rating system in the United States is an absolute joke and it should be abolished!  Have a sex/violence activity rating system like they do on Common Sense Media! At least that would be much more honest! When stabbing out a man's eye and making him blind (he was already blind in the other eye) is PG-13, then what's next? Scraping it out with a spoon?

B0033H7VI6|5.0|The SCHF9 really is a \\"bang for the buck\\" knife. Mid price range with high quality. I make custom knives and still bought this if that tells you anything. [...]The blade is 1/4\\" thick high carbon steel, and sharp out of the box. Not to big or small for outdoor jobs. The sheath is great. Does its job well and gives lots of carry options. Handle scales give a good grip and should last a long time with proper use and care. Easy to replace if damaged.
0670022411|3.0|On the plus side, this novel reads like a wonderfully researched history where the characters are full of rich depth and detail. Deborah Harkness creates a warm \\"feel\\" for the places and people (vampires, witches, and daemons) who inhabit her world and at times the warmth of hearth fires and the taste of tea can almost be experienced by the reader. On the negative side, half-way through the novel, I began to realize, 'Oh no, this is going to be another trilogy and not much of the plot is going to get resolved.' My fears were realized. In the last twenty-five pages, I felt that I had been reading a Kathleen McGowan knockoff. Sometimes it almost seemed that an editor someplace had talked her into adding every mystical literary nuance possible to her work: the Knights Templars, mystical illusions about human genetic history, etc.; it just seemed too convoluted. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the book but I kind of feel that Dr. Harkness has missed her genre: with her eye for detail and ability to create a sense of place and time, her real calling seems to me to be vivid biographies and history, maybe even historical fiction. Having written this, though, I am now looking over my shoulder looking out for wichwind to blow down my street.

B003UESJH4|5.0|The King's Speech was a lovely film.  I enjoyed it very much.  I never knew before that King George VI had a speech impediment, so it was interesting to watch this story unfold.  Colin Firth played King George and I thought he did an excellent job portraying a reluctant king.  He also gave wonderful delivery of the stammer.  Geoffrey Rush plays Lionel Logue who is King George's speech therapist.  Logue is described in the film as peculiar, a title he appreciates.  He has unconventional methods to rid his patients of their stammer and he is very successful in his approach.  Some Oscar nominated films this year were over-hyped, but this film lives up to the expectations and hype.
B002ZG9774|2.0|First of all, this movie is the same old story of small town girl down on her luck who moves to the big city and ends up becoming a huge star and saves the business.  Only difference is that Christina Aguilara is wonderful in the movie.  Her singing is great as usual.  Cher was OK.  I would give this movie a 2.5 out of 5.  As far as the blu-ray disc goes...right at the end of the movie (maybe about 1/8th of the movie left to go) the audio did not match up with the video.  It was EXTREMELY distracting to the point that I had to stop the movie.  I am upset with the quality of this disc.  I would have sent it back but didn't want the hassle.  This is unusual for Amazon as most of my purchases through them have been fine.

B004927I50|5.0|After listening to hit after hit by TS on the radio, decided not to wait for release of a greatest hits package, and have no regrets since this third release by TS plays like a hits disk with no filler at all.  This deluxe edition is the best way to go, and includes 6 bonus music tracks, a DVD with multiple videos, and a very nice   information booklet with many interesting details for fans.  Not only a great package but a great value as well.  TS is an amazing and rare creative talent, and hopefully has only just begun what will be a long and musically prolific career.  Top recommendation!

B00002Z88D|3.0|Sure, you've already heard all of these songs, so there isn't too much new (there are 2 new songs, but they're nothing to write home about.)  Overall this is a decent CD (hence the 3 stars), but if you already own the albums that contain these songs, you might be disappointed because these versions don't improve too much on the originals.  The exception to this is One.  This song absolutely blows me away every time I hear it.  The symphony complements the band perfectly.  My advice is don't buy this CD, just go on iTunes and get One.

I hope it stays truthful to this and we see the future volumes on screen.

B0046ECFRM|5.0|Anna is sent to a Parisian boarding school where she doesn't fit in, with her wrong clothes and her inability to speak French. She constantly thinks of Toph, a rocker back in Georgia whom she'll see again when she visits home, but she's also falling for her classmate &Eacute;tienne St. Clair. The friendship and mixed messages between Anna and &Eacute;tienne are to-die-for. The gradual build-up of romance is sweet and suspenseful.<br /><br />I heard so much buzz about this novel. You know how sometimes the buzz falls flat once you finish a book and you wonder what the hype was all about? Well, this didn't happen here. I adored the characters, the voice, the setting, and the yummy romance. I didn't want to let go of this book after I finished it.

There are also quite a few decent songs that you probably haven't heard before: Ronnie, Wasted My Hate, Thorn Within.  The sound is still genuine, unlike the forced crap that they're putting out now.  So even if you aren't a diehard Metallica fan, you'll probably find something on here that you enjoy.
B00457X7XQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this novel.  I found Mark Russinovich put as much great effort into this novel as he does in his Windows tools.  I found the plot kept me engaged without any periods of drag.  He presents realistic scenarios throughout the novel that relate to the plot at that time.  In fact, the scenarios were so realistic, I question if it was fiction or past experience.  As an IT professional, the items discussed were extremely realistic which allowed me to enjoy the plot.  I couldn't put my kindle down while enjoying this novel.  The fast pace kept me telling me myself, \\"Just one more chapter\\".  I am hopeful that the characters in the novel have further adventures in the future.     On a professional level, this novel will leave you thinking about the security of your own company or home network.  This will be my go to recommendations or anyone who questions my security or backup recommendations.  Although this novel may represent a worst case scenario, it is not beyond the realm of possibilities.  I guarantee you will learn one thing by reading this novel.

B003BYYDXW|3.0|\\"The Music Industry is officially dead!\\"<br /><br />Its a proclamation that is made by every generation since the invention of the radio, and it was likely going on even before those entered our homes. And each time there is a truth and a falsity to the statement. The music of that generation very often is dead, or at the very least relegated to a position other then the weekly top 40. Its just the way of the world. What I really don't understand is: why so mad?<br /><br />Bieber (if that's even how its spelled) is more of an archetype then an artist to those of us not in the target market he is aiming to associate with. There is no denying this, nor is there anything actually wrong with the implications of the statement. That's life. That's how it always is and will always be. The young need voices from their own time to retell the old tales: love, betrayal, self-identification, growing up, etc. While those of previous generations may feel that artists within their time did it \\"better\\", the truth is that they are blinded by the very thing that \\"blinds\\" the kids of today. They want and need a speaker from among their peers.<br /><br />And what is this rubbish of mocking and humiliating ones children for liking a pop artist? I don't care how bland, generic, sappy or bubblegum the crap might be -- that is simply cruel. Especially if they were actually trying to share the music with you. Music is such a deeply individual and personal thing that people need to have their own unique and individual opinions regarding it. And yet it is also such a social and societal thing with certain songs and artists, when one looks back, being able to represent a specific stretch of time. Its no better if, for instance, you tried sharing The Beatles with your kids and they went \\"Ew.\\" But they are kids -- grown ups should be able to rise above this, one would hope.<br /><br />Is it likely that Bieber is going to be The Beatles? That he could hope to hold a candle to Josh Groban? That he will have the staying power of Bach? Highly, highly doubtful. Yet in the hearts of those who listen to him now, twenty years in the future the chords of \\"Baby\\" (or any other song he might do that the person likes as a kid) might stir a certain memory, whether that be a sleepover at a friend's house, driving in the car on a rainy day to get ice cream, or having the first dance with the high school sweetheart that they eventually marry. Stranger things have happened. I would hope that as we become grown ups that we actually do grow up. Lets not have another generation of kids who recall, in the addition of my above examples, that their parents passionately hated the songs they loved and ridiculed them for their choices. Music may very well be one of the best places your kids could be trying to express themselves: the worst they have to lose is $10 to $15 on a disc. And hey, this is only $8. In *that* regard? Its a bargain. Grin and bare it.f Bach? Highly, highly doubtful.

B00004Z4WR|2.0|\\"Gone in 60 Seconds\\" is about a race to steal 50 cars in one night. I was hoping for a good plot, but the whole movie is implausible, however,  top notch stars give it a small boost of energy.  Nicholas Cage plays \\"Memphis\\" Range who comes out of retirement to save his misguided brother Kip (Giovanni Ribisi) from being killed by a sociopath black market car dealer.  The movie is full of car chases, cat and mouse cops and robbers meet-ups, and lots of excitement as Memphis has to think quick and move fast to save his brother, Kip, and keep his hard-working waitress mother from losing both her  sons.<br /><br />Angelina Jolie has a small part as a top-notch mechanic.  The great Robert Duvall plays another criminal coming out of a retirement to do one last gig to save a life and keep his friend, Memphis, and family together.  If you want a mindless chase movie to eat popcorn at, this is for you.
B004U8VWLE|5.0|This movie was amazing, it does start off a little disorienting in the beginning but slowly you begin to understand where it is going and the ending is just brilliant!

B004K4IZ3G|3.0|Are the special effects nifty and cool?  Goodness, yes.  But that's where the uniqueness ends.<br /><br />In trying to make sense out of \\"Tron: Legacy\\", it helps to have seen the original \\"Tron\\".  Other scenes you will recognize from other movies anyway.<br /><br />Never mind the fact that the chronology is off and our hero Sam Flynn's age is off by about 7 or 9 years:  The film supposedly takes place in modern day - 2010.  Sam, once in the grid, tells his dad Kevin he is 27 years old.  Kevin disappeared 21 years earlier, back in 1989, making young Sam six years old at the time.  But on the night in 1989 when he disappeared, we see Kevin and Sam talking together and Sam is WAY older than 6.  He's probably closer to 14 years old.  That should make him at least in his early thirties in modern day.  Fail.<br /><br />And there are a great many moments in the film that seem lifted from other films.  I counted at least 2 moments that were blatantly lifted from \\"Batman Begins\\", two from \\"The Dark Knight\\", god knows how many from \\"The Matrix\\", one or two from the original \\"Star Wars\\", and several cliched moments that could have come from any of a dozen generic action films.<br /><br />When Sam, on a quest to locate his missing father, gets pulled into the grid and is forced to engage in gladiator games, no explanation is offered why those games exist or are necessary.  It is explained in \\"Tron\\" but not in this sequel.  A newbie to this universe might be left scratching his head.  And seemingly everyone in this new universe knows martial arts.  That wasn't the case in the original \\"Tron\\", but it seems necessary in \\"Legacy\\" because movies of recent years feature a lot of martial arts fighting and \\"Legacy\\" borrows heavily from recent movies.<br /><br />It is great to have Jeff Bridges back on board, but his character in this film is almost indistinguishable from his \\"Dude\\" character in \\"The Big Lebowski\\".  His Flynn character in \\"Tron\\" wasn't at all like that.<br /><br />The film's score is heavy-handed at times.  Even during an overly-long dinner and plot exposition scene, the score plays too loudly and forcefully.  Very intrusive.<br /><br />What drives the thin plot in \\"Legacy\\" is our hero's attempts to escape from the grid without the chief villain obtaining Kevin Flynn's identity disc.  It is never explicitly clear what the villain really needs it for, either.  There's a lot of talk about the urgency of it but not very specific detail.<br /><br />Sam Flynn manages to escape the grid by employing a move that I doubt he would have known about unless he had seen the first \\"Tron\\" movie.  So I guess in the \\"Tron: Legacy\\" universe, the film \\"Tron\\" had played in theaters or on home video and Sam saw it.  How fortunate.<br /><br />Truth is, aside from the very impressive visuals there is not much in the storytelling of \\"Legacy\\" that is all that original or compelling.  Most everything about it seems borrowed and the sentimentality seems forced.<br /><br />The Blu-ray release is visually stunning on all fronts and has a satisfying amount of bonus content.  But that stuff is expected nowadays and can hardly be used as a selling point anymore.<br /><br />In the end, \\"the play's the thing\\".  You can watch it only so many times before the \\"wow factor\\" of the special effects wears off.  After that, the story has to sustain your interest.

B003XWEQ1G|4.0|The critics deadpanned this addition to the Robin Hood film library, choosing to mostly focus on Crowe's \\"incorrect\\" accent and lament the sacking of the original script that saw the Sheriff as the hero and Robin as the villain. Reviews like that immediately set off alarm bells that perhaps these nitpickings were smoke screens. Afterall, who was alive in the late 12th century to tell us that the persona didn't have an Irish or Welsh flavoured accent? Why should the Robin Hood legend bow to 21st century story-telling conventions that grey villains and make heroes out to be the real misguided folk? (Although ironically the latter isn't far from today's truth.)<br /><br />Having seen and thoroughly enjoyed the version that was actually made (being this one), I understand why H-wood was disappointed. Crowe's 'Robin' isn't championing the redistribution of wealth and stands up for Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness--the very ideals that would lead to the Magna Carta (the patriarch to America's own founding documents).The only other Robin Hood film to do this was 1938's [[ASIN:B0013N3DSE The Adventures of Robin Hood]] with Errol Flynn.<br /><br />Cate Blanchette brings as much gravitas to the Marian role as did Olivia de Havilland in '38. She's no easy mark for Robin and it takes the full length of the film for Robin to turn her eyes in a way that isn't a distrustful glare. I thought the touch at the end may have been a bit of a cow-tow to feminism and unrealistic to the period, but it was tasefully handled and in no way detracted from the story.<br /><br />My biggest gripe with the story was Scott's disappointing representation of the Crusades in film (again) and Richard's wars with the French. It's especially disappointing given the filmmaker's clear love for the long ago. I don't know.. maybe the studio forces such a period film to criticize the Crusades and be apologetic about Europe's role.<br /><br />The opening title card tells us that the film starts after King Richard has returned from his \\"plundering\\" during the Third Crusade and is making war on the French, who decided to take some of his lands while he was gone (under the duplitious watch of King Phillip, an ever present rival of Richard's throughout most of his life). In the case of the latter events--umm, isn't Richard simply being a good king by making war on those who would steal from him?<br /><br />But in the case of the Crusade, Scott lingers a bit longer, making sure that the audience knows that in his opinion, the killing of 2500 Muslims at Acre was \\"godless\\". The interesting thing here is that Scott would have us infer that the majority of those killed were women and children (quite the opposite in reality) and that he simply killed them for no reason (also untrue). In both cases, Scott stands at odds with most historians! But that isn't even the most important of the case.<br /><br />Within the context of the time, it is the concensus of scholars that Richard had little choice but to kill the prisoners. First, because he was leaving Acre and he couldn't have the men (who comprised the majority of the prisoners) joining up with Saladin to fight against him. Second, because Saladin had been stalling for time to regain his strength for an attack, and was playing games with an agreed upon prisoner exchange. Third, the prisoner exchange (which was to include the True Cross captured at Hattin) technically had been agreed to by a lesser-officer without Saladin's kowledge and it wasn't an agreement he particularly liked. And fourth, Richard may have wanted a bit of revenge for the hundreds of Templar and Hospitaller captives that Saladin had had beheaded (by amateur soldiers no less) following Hattin (see Scott's excellent [[ASIN:B000ICLRIE Kingdom of Heaven (Director's Cut)]]).<br /><br />The most interesting of all is that records, written by a known Muslim archivist of Saladin's army, speaks of the Acre incident very matter-of-factly.. as if he understoodthe decision and would have done likewise in a similar position of war. And later on, when Richard and Saladin come to terms at Jaffa, they deal with each other honorably--as if the Acre incident wasn't so much of an issue. This is significant given the long memory of the Muslim warrior.<br /><br />These departures from history must be known in order to appreciate just how good this film could have been had Scott made a film that brought these issues to the viewer.<br /><br />What the film doesn't depart from is a wonderful portrayal of the ideals of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness that would come from England's Magna Carta, and go on to influence the men who would bring democracy to the West centuries later; the film also remains true to the source material in that the story is NOT a commentary on class warfare (rob from rich to give to poor), that has burdened so many Robin Hood adaptations since Flynn's, but on the relationship of citizens and government.<br /><br />The audio and video of the blu-ray edition is fantastic to superb; the extras aren't bad, but there's no commentary from Scott, Crowe, and/or Blanchette?!<br /><br />Although the film bows the head a bit to modern filmmaking conventions (e.g. the Crusades were simply white Christian guys looting the world, killing \\"innocent\\" Muslims along the way, and robbing the Islamic community of its 'rightful lands'), it's refreshing to see a modern filmmaker get the Robin Hood legend closer to historical than any other. It was interesting to see a film that told a bit of a prequel than the story everyone mosly knows. Crowe's Robin Hood fits quite nicely beside my Errol Flynn version.osition of war.

B004IKDUTQ|4.0|This is another great album from the finnish stars Turisas.  The first half of the album simply blew me away.  From the powerful opening track The March of the Varangian Guard to the epic Take The Day into a song that had to grow on me, but is now a favorite, Hunting Pirates, to the mostly instrumental tune with a slovic name, to Stand Up and Fight, it's hard to skip a tune!  They basically took everything that was awesome from the Varangian Way and added to it.    Definitely not as heavy as some of their other works, but I think that's a good thing.  I love the heavy stuff, but it comes later on this album.    The second half of the album is awesome as well, however for some reason I can't bring myself to get there.  I keep playing the first half over and over, though songs like Fear the Fear and End of an Empire are awesome.
030726999X|1.0|I liked the first two books and might give them 3 stars but this third book is a waste of time. The best part of the series is the main character Lisbeth and yet she hardly shows up in the third book at all. Berger and Blomkvist, the characters that take up most the type, are as one dimensional and predictable as they were in the first two books. I forced myself to wade through this book only to realize I could have jumped to the last hundred pages and been done.  Haven't read any of the series yet? Watch the movie and skip the books.

1439107955|5.0|The Emperor of All Maladies is a tremendous achievement.  It is the compelling story of cancer.  It is history, it is memoir, and it is a reminder that medical progress is the result of fits and starts and blind alleys and high hopes.  Overall, this book is an optimistic one.  Great strides have been made in fighting cancer, especially in the last 50-60 years.  Siddhartha Mukherjee documents the stories of the researchers whose single-minded determination has made it possible.    This book deserves the highest possibly praise.  It is even more remarkable because it is a first book.  Mukherjee could benefit from a more declarative prose style.  There is a lot of long winded verbiage at times.  Too many commas.  But the work is compelling because the story is compelling.  Mukherjee's injection of his own personal clinical history with cancer through his patients is worth a book on its own.    Mostly, Emperor of All Maladies is a glimpse into a closed world where death stares you in the face and even if you are a cancer survivor, you never look at life the same way again.  I am thankful that Siddhartha Mukherjee took on this task.  It is an accomplishment.
0756404738|5.0|Wonderful! Well worth the wait. I truly hope that we don't have to wait another 4 years for the next book in the series, though, because I don't think I can bear the suspense that long! I was torn between wanting to read the book as quickly as possible, and wanting to take my time and savor it. I wanted to see how the book would end... but didn't want it to end. Now that I've finished it, all I can say is WOW.<br /><br />I love the Rothfuss takes his time telling the story, letting it wind through unexpected places rather than pushing it ahead in a more typical story arc. It allows for better character development, surprises of plot... and is simply a pleasure to read. Rothfuss has a way with words that few have matched. I can see his admiration for Gaiman -- another author whose works captivate me -- on every page, even while he maintains his own distinct style.
B0041KKYEM|3.0|It has taken me a while to see Darren Aronofsky's acclaimed 2010 psychological thriller probably because the marketing campaign at the time of its December release focused more on the film's sensationalistic, horror-film elements. In the meantime, Natalie Portman collected a truckload of awards for her searing portrayal of Nina Sayers, a talented ballerina whose mental state declines as pressure mounts around her starring performance in a new staging of Tchaikovsky's \\"Swan Lake\\" by a prestigious New York City ballet company. She is quite good, although I am less relatively enamored by the film itself, especially toward the end, which beyond recalling Aronofsky's earlier work, 2000's [[ASIN:B00005Q4CS Requiem for a Dream]], comes across as an intensely kinetic albeit derivative hybrid of [[ASIN:B003ICZW8M The Red Shoes]], [[ASIN:B00005K3NR Carrie]], and [[ASIN:0767802616 Single White Female]].<br /><br />Co-written by Mark Heyman, Andres Heinz, and John J. McLaughlin, the screenplay melds Nina's reality, dreams, and hallucinations into quite a ripe melodrama. Nina has long dreamed about playing the lead in \\"Swan Lake\\", and her fantasy comes true in a moment of pure bliss before her descent into madness. The ballet troupe's manipulative director Thomas Leroy picks Nina to replace aging prima ballerina Beth MacIntyre to play the Swan Queen, which is two roles in one - Odette, the virginal White Swan awaiting a kiss from the Prince, and her heartless twin, Odile, the sexually predatory Black Swan who lures the prince away. Leroy knows Nina is fully capable of playing the former but remains unconvinced she could exude the sensuality needed to play the latter. While she has trained her whole life for this opportunity, she remains an insecure, emotionally bruised woman still living with her overbearing mother Erica, a former ballerina who never reached the rarefied heights her daughter is about to enter.<br /><br />Complicating matters is Lily, a new arrival to the company from San Francisco and as liberated a free spirit as Nina is sexually repressed. Meanwhile, as Nina performs to the demands of the role, she crumbles in hidden ways that have her start imagining herself transforming into a swan. Present in almost every frame of the film, Portman is terrific conveying Nina's tentative nature in a way that makes her dedicated training all the more haunting for the sacrifices she makes to achieve her goal of artistic perfection. Within the confines of his predictable role, Vincent Cassel is malevolent enough as the autocratic Leroy, and Barbara Hershey really excels in her few scenes as Erica, showing why Nina's self-esteem has become practically nil. With her haughty manner and skeletal frame, Winona Ryder has more of an extended cameo as Beth, but she makes her fatalistic sense palpable. As Lily, Mila Kunis is almost effortless as Nina's saucy, distrustful competitor.<br /><br />Compounded by Matthew Labatique's constantly moving camera, Aronofsky's florid direction works on an almost surreal level for about the first three-quarters of the film's 108-minute running time, but his lurid horror-film approach gets excessive toward the end when Nina's confusion between reality and fantasy signals an inability to deal with the life she thought she wanted. The 2011 DVD/BluRay offers an extensive, 49-minute making-of documentary, \\"Black Swan Metamorphosis\\" which includes on-set footage and interviews with cast and crew. In addition, there are short featurettes focusing on the ballet sequences, the production design, the costumes, Portman's preparation for the role and Aronofsky's creative process. There are also interviews of the principals from Fox Movie Channel Presents, as well as the theatrical trailer.sco and as liberated a free spirit as Nina is sexually repressed.

B0000DDAU9|4.0|........that it would seem unfair after regarding their other albums.  Mastodon is an absolute tour de force in the world of metal and rock music.  They have schematically themed every album to date. This record being that of \\"fire.\\"  It is exactly that. It's an explosive, premature ejaculation of an album. Almost every song is fast, furious and demanding of an ear that has a taste for the insane. The few moments within that are slow and melodic seem forced in a primal manner to lure the listener into the onslaught of rage that follows. Mastodon is a band that have taken all of the positive elements of today's metal and refined them into a very different style of music. Their later albums are definitely more polished. Remission is devastatingly heavy beginning to a band that has shown their desire and love for the art of music. As a lover of everything music, this album should never go unheard.
B000I5XOW8|4.0|The movie itself is Excellent! The Blu-Ray... Well its not superior or out of this world by any means. Compared to the DVD, it is a little sharper & cleaner. The dark scenes are easier to watch but I did notice some blacks not as crisp as they should be. The surround sound during the train wreck sequence was spot on! However, that's really the only point in the movie that you get good full use of it. All in all if you like the movie & are looking to change to Blu-Ray, then by all means purchase this disc. If you just want to watch it again, then buy the DVD or rent it!
B004NYQYNQ|5.0|I love this CD. It took me a while to decide who she reminds me of. This CD is great for listening & good for dancing also.  I purchased my CD from Amazon along with other popular CD's that have been winners.
B002TLSSXO|5.0|I really like the Elevate 6-piece kitchen tool set.  The tools feel good in your hand, are not wimpy and do keep messes off the counter. In fact I liked the tools so much, I've gotten an additional regular and slotted spoon.
B001C46P2K|5.0|I loved this movie.  The actors portray the real people amazingly.  What I loved about this movie the most was that after I watched it, it inspired me to learn more about these people.  I was even more pleased to find that unlike most historical movies, the story line was VERY true to fact.  It was nice to see filmakers take real facts, and make it into a movie for all to see. Not like the Other Boleyn Girl, which had extreme factual errors. It was great to see the TRUTH come out of a historical romantic movie. I would highly recommend this movie.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|\\"Inside Job\\"    This is a story everyone should know. Most of us suspected these things, but never really knew. A big history lesson on our leaders both republican and  democrat, who we thought were protecting us really sold us down the river to help their friends and supporters get rich while the rest of us got less, much less.
0670022411|1.0|This book could have been a LOT shorter:  Oopsie, I used my magic to read a book. Too bad my dead parents didn't tell me that I am the most powerful witch the world has ever seen.    Oh, hey look, there's a vampire.  I'm going to go for a run.  But oh, how I love the vampire.  Geez, I'm sleepy.  Really, really, really sleepy.   Man, this vampire's mom HATES witches.  I think I'll bond with her and use her as a substitute mother.    Oh, look, I'm being tortured but I can use my magic I didn't know I had to float out of the cellar. Oh where, oh where is my vampire love? I don't exist without him.    Oopsie, I used my magic to grossly issue water out of every orifice in my body.  Oh, would you look at that, I can create fire too!  Oh, man, would you look at that, I can timewalk!!   Is there anything I can't do? Ummm, oh yeah... magic.    So I must rely on my vampire love to save me and give me orders on what I must do to keep his love. Oh, how I love this creature.   Hey, why is demon spelled daemon?  Hmmmm, I'll mull that over while I- snoooooooore... oopsie, had to take a nap. I'm very weak from learning about all things I can't do yet.    OK, time to timewalk!  And take my vampire with me!  This is so exciting, I'm going to go really, really far back in time so I can learn how to use my magic, so I can then come back, and fight a war. Look at that, my timewalking looks an awful lot like the hokey pokey!   Oopsie, forgot to actually end the book! See you in book 2- this is so exciting, I'll get to do a lot of napping and a lot more nothing in that one, I betcha!! Yay!
0060936223|4.0|I was a great fan of Patti Smith in my younger days but as she has grown older she has become an example of the kind of New Age weirdness and political correctness that make my teeth grind.*<br /><br />So it was with some trepidation that I picked her memoirs of her time with Robert Mapplethorpe, expecting peace and love-type psychobabble.<br /><br />Instead, it was a well-written, disciplined account of her relationship with him and early life and mercifully free from her political opinions.<br /><br />She also resisted the temptation to get over-emotional about some episodes in her life, such as giving away her baby daughter when she was 19, and her description of how she and Mapplethorpe went their separate ways is refreshingly sober.<br /><br />Her obsession with French badboy poet Rimbaud becomes a bit tedious especially as she does not explain why he was so important to her.<br /><br />Nor does she give any good reason why she and Mapplethorpe chose to live in a cramped room in the Chelsea Hotel next to the room where Dylan Thomas died.<br /><br />The quality slips at times and name dropping abounds - Dylan (Bob, not the Welsh one), William Burroughs, Salvador Dali, Janis Joplin, Lou Reed and Alan Ginzburg** - but overall the book is low key, factual and fairly convincing.<br /><br />There are also incisive barbs such as her comment comparing Mapplethorpe with Andy Warhol: \\"I preferred an artist who transformed his time, not mirrored it.\\"<br /><br />It's difficult to believe she was as innocent and naïve as she makes out.<br /><br />Patti Smith obviously regards herself as a \\"writer, performer and visual artist\\". However, as far as I am concerned she is a rock singer and will be judged as such.<br /><br />I`ll never forget the impact her first album had on me when I was a student in Edinburgh in the early/mid 1970s and life was founded on rock and roll and first love.<br /><br />* Check out her site if you don't believe me. ** Who thought she was a boy the first time he met her.
B000N6U0E2|5.0|Excellent movie with stunning performances by Will Smith and his son Jayden Smith. A profoundly inspiring story that will make you smile,and make you cry. After seeing this in the theater we had to purchase it as soon as it was available on DVD. Appropriate for family viewing.
1936041111|3.0|Written as a letter from Dr. Frankenstein to his sister about his creation and experiences with his monster, \\"Frankenstein\\" is an experience every person can identify with.  Throughout the book, Dr. Frankenstein deals with his remorse for creating such a wretched creature, and the monster abhors Dr. Frankenstein for the same reason.<br /><br />Hollywood representations of the monster known as Frankenstein, as well as the relationship between the monster and Dr. Frankenstein are very mistaken.  Frankenstein does not arise from a table to act like a mindless zombie, Dr. Frankenstein does not scream \\"He's alive! He's alive,\\" and their relationship is not one of a mad scientist creating a beast that will do his destructive bidding.<br /><br />In fact, he is a very learned creature, and he received his education from Plutarch's \\"Lives,\\" Goethe's \\"Sorrows of Wurther,\\" and Milton's \\"Paradise Lost.\\"  It is only after much scorn that Frankenstein turns into a destructive monster, perhaps best emulated by the transition in psyche of Thomas Harris's Hannibal Lechter.<br /><br />For those who want an adventurous read about rape and murder, Frankenstein offers no such thing.  This book, which at times seems more like a prequel to common Frankenstein movies, fluctuates about as much as the sea from which Dr. Frankenstein writes it.  At no time does Shelley, who wrote Frankenstein at only 17, offer her readers a cliffhanger; though, with every page she writes with enough maturity to reveal the monsters all humans are either in danger of becoming or creating.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|The gameplay is excellent, there actually is a plot to this Angry Birds game. I've already completed the two worlds that came with this game and I absolutely can't wait for the next one to be released in May. Best Angry Birds game out of the three.
B00407PNWO|5.0|No one, but no one, can beat Errol Flynn when it comes to portraying the classic swashbuckling hero Robin Hood.  In my humble opinion he set the bar and no one has yet reached it.  Oh, there have been many remakes and re-visions of this story which are supposedly closer to what the time was like, i.e., dirtier and grimy.  But for pure escapist fare, adventure, and pure, pure fun, this one can't be topped.  The bad guys are clearly bad and the good guys are definitely good.
B004HWR406|1.0|...can a movie so well done on one side be so boring and useless?<br />Who cares about the story of the less friendly and less nice, hysterical nerd in town?<br />If were possible to give negative stars I would have use it all!
0060936223|3.0|I'm not particularly familiar with Patti Smith's work, tho I know Robert Mapplethorpe's work a bit better.  I had high hopes for this book, as a memoir of a fascinating time in NYC, and of two artists growing together.  I wasn't entirely disappointed, I really enjoyed the memories of the Chelsea Hotel and Max's, and wasn't turned off by the name-dropping that a lot of people have commented on.  I also thought Smith did a good job conveying hers and Mapplethorpe's artistic world and approach to life-- making choices and having ambitions that truly set them apart from the rest of us who have regular jobs and less exciting creative lives than we'd like.  I was ok with the liberties it seems she may have taken at certain points in the story, as someone else wrote, most autobiographies have to be taken with a greain of salt.    My biggest disappointments began with Smith's inability to convey her angry punk persona or voice that she is known for.  She makes occasional reference to Mapplethorpe being concerend about her confrontational personality, and tells a story of Jan Wenner of Rolling Stone telling her he'll hire her even though she 'talks like a truck driver.'  Really?  I'd never know that.  She sounds like a French literature student throughout the book.  I'm a confrontational woman myself, and would've enjoyed seeing some of that on the page.  Along the same lines, I was surprised that she seemed extremely passive towards men, as one or two other reviewers have pointed out.  It's actually intriguing, although her total lack of introspection about her life meant that I had to draw all the contradictions between her supposed androgynous, angry powerful woman persona, and her poor romantic choices and seeming lack of agency in the development of her career.    Finally, this brings me to an undercurent of homophobia in the book that really surprised me.  Smith only refers to Mapplethope as a 'homosexual' never as 'gay' even though by the time she arrived in NYC 'gayliberation' was already a term.  At one point late in the book she refers to his 'sexual persuasion' as if it's a choice, or something that was not inherent to his being-- his art is synonymous with gay identity, and to use these terms shows a real lack of understanding or distancing from this essential aspect of his life.  I'd be interested to learn more about how she felt about Mapplethorpe coming out of the closet, she addresses it very lightly, even though in my mind it seems obvious that she remained in love with him probably until her marriage and move to Detroit.  She was happy to have sex with him long after he'd come out and they'd broken up-- not something most women I know would do if they really felt platonically about their former lover.  I beleive that part of her homophobia is her discomfort with her own sexuality.  As an LGBT woman I found so much of her story to be familiar to women who at some point in their lives have relationships with women.  Whether it is her androgynous physicality, her repeated relationships with gay men or otherwise unavailable men (married, on the road all the time), and her stated 'intellectual' interest in the styles of other women much girlier than herself, and her one line denial of being a  'latent homosexual', I think Smith may have some other issues to work out.  Maybe she has in real life, but it's disappointing she can't do it here, can't be reflective about her sexuality on the page.    Thank you Ms Smith for giving me something to write about-- a sign of a good book.
B00003CXMG|5.0|It had been a long time since I'd seen this movie, and I'd mostly forgotten what happened. Boy I'm happy I decided to watch it again, as I appreciated much more now that I'm older. This is simply one of the best coming of age stories I've ever seen. It features great acting, a funny and entertaining story, and very original characters. It also features the perfect ending, I don't think I would change anything about the movie.

B000005J56|5.0|This album and the dvd/documentary are amazing musicianship. I thank ry cooder and the cubans for providing such a great source of music its beautiful. Also ry cooder has proved to me he can do anything when it comes to music. By buying cooders albums i have learned so much about different genres of music. Ry cooders music makes me think outside the box and not to stick with one genre of music. I think i would be bored of music quick if i just liked one genre thank you cooder for all the great albums you have made. All of your music is good. What ever you touch musically turns to gold.
B004DK5CYM|2.0|While it was interesting to see the background behind Secretariat's story, this movie feels like a made-for-TV feel-good movie.  As a horse person, some of what they showed with the horses was just foolish.  The BluRay looked nice on the new HD TV with the new player.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I'm sorry to admit but this book was a big disappointment for me. The first two books were GREAT but this one lacked luster. I actually skipped ahead alot and even skipped the last couple of chapters and just read the last chapter and didn't really get much from that either. I actually heard this from a co-worker and still decided to read it. I wished I would have just stopped on book two.
B00164GDD2|5.0|I've seen Ghostbusters more times than I can count.  I've seen it at a drive-in, theatrically, and countless times on VHS, DVD, and TV.  But, I was still blown away by this Blu-ray.  The amount of detail you can see is staggering, and the special effects have been ever so-slightly remastered. (only fixing where the streams hit Slimer when they blast him).    For even a casual fan, this is a must buy.  Definitely worth every penny, and more.  The only issue I had with it was the load time.  That could just be my player, though, so I won't take the rating down for that.
B000CCD0HQ|5.0|Wow! I love how orginal zz top is thats what makes them so great then and now. This album is subperb period. I love how the album starts with waiting for the bus then goes right into jesus left chicago without skipping a beat. Buy this with out even thinking twice its that good.
B001NFNFIK|5.0|This was a great movie. TLJ fits so well in this type of film. The film kept you interested and was enloyable to watch.
B00005JLR2|5.0|I loved this one the first time I saw it and my youngest son and I can watch this every day and not grow tired of it!<br /><br />I love the sci-fi twist of tresure island! I recall reading the original book and though this is rather loosely based on it and one can pick up elements here and there, Tresure Island is so nicely sci-fi that it really is it's own tale.<br /><br />Joseph Gordon-Levitt does a teriffic job as young Jim. Emma Thompson and David Hyde Pierce also do so very well as sparring partners and then as more by the end of the film. Very, very good!
B003F3NDWG|5.0|Castle is one of a kind. I have both seasons and can hardly wait to order the third season. I want it to go on forever.
B001TODCII|5.0|Good. They should have stopped at the first one.
B0043EV774|5.0|Reading the reviews here I got the feeling these were more hand picked by Amazon to increase their (no doubt disappointing) sales of 3D TVs than to give all us \\"poor people\\" a review of the movie itself!    Burton has yet again proved he can bring a totally new dimension (Again, I'm NOT talking 3D!)to his brand of reinventing storytelling. The special effects are a WOW with a delightful choice of color schemes. His version of the charactors brings a new perspective to the almost worn out story (at least for us Timothy Leary leftovers, and the casting is just delightful.    I will be honest and say I was a bit off put by the ending on my first viewing, but I must have had something to eat prior to watching (the schrooms? LOL)and on watching again find this one of my rarely given heartfelt 5 star ratings!     I've now enjoyed it over 6 times (on Hi-Def Cable)and am just now ordering the deluxe set before all those special features are gone forever!    A TRUE delight!    John Cheney 88    PS Remember what the doormouse said!
B001GCUNWQ|5.0|I was pleasently suprised that this third film is as good as the first! After the failing story lines in the shrek series I'm glad that Ice Age was able to find a way to keep the same wonderful relationship of the charcs while keeping the story line fresh!

0805092447|3.0|Whoops - read carefully.  Hardcover is not the board book.  I returned because I need the board book.  Overall - great book and you need to get the durable version because you will be reading this one over and over and over....
B00005R23Z|5.0|I really like this one! I like the interplay of Ethan Hawke and Jude Law as well as Uma Thurman and her husband and then ex-husband. They had a wonderful chemistery that totally made the film. The cat and mouse with the cops was another great eliment. Just an over all solid enjoyable, strange sci-fi film.
B003TJR2HS|4.0|It works great.  It just took me a few tries to figure out the orientation.  Was a little surprised the logo doesn't face out when it's docked.  After that, it doesn't matter.  I just leave it on my docking station.
0756404738|5.0|I finished the book today and it was awesome!   Of course there were some things I didn't like, such as how the story really lagged sometimes, especially during the first part of Kvothe's stay at the University. I was really bored and frustrated because there was so little action except for Kvothe making things at the Fishery. So I was glad when he finally left the University. From there the true adventure starts.  Overall, the book was satisfying, though I must admit that I like The Name of the Wind more. But still, I loved the book.    I just hope that the author doesn't make this series a trilogy, or else...or else...the series will just disappoint all readers. I only like The Wise Man's Fear because it is a good 2nd book. If the next book is the last one in the series, then...well, I don't get how the author is going to wrap up everything in one book.   I dearly wish the series will be as long as six to seven books. After all, as I said, there are many loose ends the author has to cover, like why Kvothe ended up as Kote, what Bast is up to, about the \\"war,\\" who is looking for Kote (like the weird mercenary from TNOFW), about Denna, if Kvothe ever returned to the Fae, how Kvothe met Bast, the Amyr, and the Chandarians and if Kvothe found anything about them. I just can't wait for the next book!

B000EQ5SR0|4.0|I greatly enjoyed this movie.  Good acting with an interesting storyline that really kept me intrigued through out the movie.  Lots of action kept it upbeat while being drawn in by the suspense & mystery of the storyline with the added spice of romance.
B002ZG980U|5.0|I saw this film at the theater, the first show, Midnight showing Thursday night.  From that night, I knew I HAD to purchase this film when it came out on DVD.  The people who say they fell asleep watching this film are the same ones who probably rushed out to see 'Prince of Persia' when it came out.  If you're not the kind of person who actually likes to think while they watch a movie, then no, this film isn't for you.  You will have to think.  I think it's extraordinary what Chris Nolan did with this film.  The idea of being able be inside of a dream, going deeper and deeper into the dream--essentially, a dream within a dream--is something I find absolutely fascinating.<br /><br />I love to see films that look like the writer/director put a little thought into what they were doing before they did it.  Many people just like to watch a movie and have the plot and everything else be self-explanatory.  They like to just be \\"entertained.\\"  My idea of entertainment isn't mindless action sequences, drawn-out gunfights and unnecessary sex scenes.  I would much rather watch a film that requires the audience to actually think about what's happening and be completely involved in the film.<br /><br />If you don't like films like that, don't watch 'Inception.'  Also, if you do watch it, don't get up to go to the bathroom or to the kitchen for more popcorn without pausing it because you will DEFINITELY miss something.<br /><br />All in all, I think this was an amazing film and actually the only film that I actually like Leonardo Di Carprio in.
B004G600A4|3.0|Just an average animated movie. I guess i expected to much from this movie and got just an animation.I liked the lantern concept and how it was used into the story.This animation doesnt really pull you in,it wasnt amazing it was just an ok animation.I guess i havent watched to many disney movies.I guess i didnt expect it to be a musical. Even for a musical/animation the song choices were ehh.I mean really, I think there could of been better music/song choices.But I guess am comparing it to much to some really great ones like \\"The Jungle Book\\" or pixar's \\"Up\\".To me it was just another animation to pass the time.\\"Average\\".Not to extravagant and not to cheap.
B001ECQ6YW|5.0|The men in my house (there are four of them and one of me, the girl hehe) LOVE this movie. I think certain parts are amusing (love the turtle blowing out EACH candel one at a time!!), but over all, not a Jack Black fan. Not that it's a BAD movie, but not my style rather.<br /><br />As I said, the boys and my husband (I think even the dog secretly likes it) love it and always have a great time watching it. I did purchase it for my husband, so, that proves my point rather nicely. hehe
1595141979|5.0|As Shadow Kiss is the third book in the Vampire Academy series, I was expecting a lot from this book. And boy did it deliver!<br /><br />Richelle Mead brings you deeper into the society of Morio and Dhampirs, after the attack during winter break in Frostbite. Rose continues to be our heroine, the story being told in the first person. I honestly don't think these books could have been written any other way.<br /><br />While Vampire Academy and Frostbite start out fairly light & airy, Shadow Kiss tends to dip deeper into the societal moors of this vampire species (and its sub-species, the Moroi, Dhampirs and Strigoi). It's definitely a darker novel, something I tend to enjoy in books such as these.<br />Mead tells the most intense story yet with Shadow Kiss; Rose is continuing on her path to graduation, so she can be the best Guardian possible to Lissa, also her BFF, but with a great deal of introspection.<br />She is forced to explore her mental stamina and determine whether or not she really wants to be a Guardian over being with Dimitri, the man she loves. Dimitri, the biggest, baddest-ass Guardian finally lets down his guard and accepts that sometimes life isn't as simple as he'd like it to be. And I think that's one of the messages here: Life throws curve balls at you. It is up to you to decide how you want to swing.<br /><br />In past novels, Mead only touched briefly on the Vampire monarchy and politics. In Shadow Kiss, she dives deep and lets us examine Queen Tatiana and her own desires and motives for Princess Lissa, who, I think, will be a pawn in future political maneuverings. She gives us more of Adrian and his exploration of Spirit, which brings him to the Academy, even though he's a little older. She allows us to grieve with her characters for Mason, a kind-hearted, brave novice Guardian who was tragically murdered in Frostbite.<br /><br />Most of all, she invests us in her characters and makes us want to read more. And that, my friends, makes a good book.
B0006J28BO|1.0|It was ok, but I've seen better from Studio Ghibli.  I had this item in my cart for awhile and I came across it at Blockbuster one night and decided to give it a shot.  Again, glad I rented it first because it was NOT something I would purchase.  I think I would've been really mad if I had bought this online and watched it.  Usually when I watch Studio Ghibli films I walk away remembering something breathtaking or a wonderful feeling I got while watching it.  Not so with this one.  I don't remember anything about this film except for some cats walkin' around on their hind legs talking and crap.  Again, don't waste your money, rent it.  It cost me 2 bucks to rent at Blockbuster.
B004FOA84A|4.0|I liked it.  My only compaint is that it's too short.  Hey, what do you expect for a dollar, though.  Great graphics.  Keep up the good work.
B002VWNID6|3.0|This has always been one of my favorite movies and I was thrilled to finally replace my VHS copy.  I was all settled in watching my movie when half way through it stopped.  I had to flip it over to watch the rest of the movie!  This is not the first cheap DVD I have purchased through Amazon but it is the last. The last few DVD's I have purchased have been poor quality (out of focus, skips, etc.)
B004EBZX6W|5.0|This is a great app. I knew that I had a few neighbors with wireless and didn't realize that pretty much everyone left them at their default chanel. I changed my router to a different channel and now have a much better signal. Oh, and some idiot gave 2 stars because of ads, give me a break. App doesn't work any differently!!
B004SKEHP2|5.0|This album is a great step in Sum 41 direction. It has a great variety of heavy and soft parts. It has more piano than any other of their albums, and is much more technical. In songs like \\"blood in my eyes\\" and \\"Reason to believe\\" the time signature changes give the songs a great feel. There is also a lot more cool guitar work on this album like Chuck. The only thing I would have changed on this album would have been the songs \\"time for you to go\\" and \\"baby you don't wanna know\\", as thy don't really fit the album, even though they are pretty solid songs.
B004FRX0MY|4.0|cloud player is awesome. if u have a good phone it works. only Ishmael u could shuffle through cloud music and hrdrive music and that it had a background or cool album art. 4 stars
031261246X|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo3JKWSMZROCRA2]]Watch my video to see what I think of this amazing book!  The technical detail is just enough to give some insight into the realm of computer jargon, but not enough to bore the average reader.  The story between the main characters captured me from beginning to end.  The beginning was a little racy for my tastes, but it surprised me enough that I continued reading and I was so glad I did!!!  I hope this one makes it to the big screen!
0307474712|5.0|I found this book to be totally engrossing. I was completely unaware of the ending and so was taken quite by surprise, but I was truly touched by the entire novel. Emma and Dexter became my companions during the several busy days it took me to read the book as I often found myself thinking about them while doing other things. I will miss them, especially on July 15.
B00003CXAA|2.0|I ordered this set as \\"new\\".  However, it came unsealed and marred.  I was giving it as a gift and was a bit embarrassed that it didn't seem \\"new\\" as expected.  It hasn't been viewed yet, so I don't know if there is any damage to the disks.  I was very disappointed.
B004NSULHM|3.0|Another experimental effort by the band, some tracks are stronger than others, some a disappointment, and a shorter compilation than we Radiohead fans are used to lately. I love Radiohead, loved In Rainbows, but I agree with a lot of other reviewers that the last half is better than the first half, and can't get past some of the muddiness of it all. Overall it seems a rambling effort with no real focus at times; I too was looking forward to something that would lead us down the brilliant, groundbreaking path that In Rainbows took us, but didn't find it here. A bit sad, but maybe the next album will contain more of that spark and forward motion that In Rainbows had (a perfect mix of abstract and concrete). Some strong tracks: Little by Little, Lotus Flower, and Codex.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I think this is better than the oginal. the control seems more  refined. i have an easier time getting full stars. Plus i like rescueing birds rather than a pig kiling. :-)
068981528X|4.0|If you've ever rooted for the Wile E. Coyote to prevail over the Roadrunner, or longed for Sylvester to triumph over that manipulative Tweety Bird; then this is your book. The classic 19th century fairy tale of the Big Bad Wolf, has been flipped in Trivizas's retelling, and now it's the three little wolves who get the glory.<br /><br />This is a great read aloud for elementary age students to teach a variety of lessons. Concepts such as what makes a reputation, cultural and individual perspectives, villains and heroes, and story prediction. The wonderful illustrations pull the whole story together, and do an admirable job at hiding some of the more awkward word and phrase choices by the author. For at times the rhythm is thrown out of whack by oddly long sentences that seem to want to say too much, with words thesaurus driven. However, despite this drawback, this is a book kids really enjoy. The twist immediately grabs their attention, and they can't wait to see what happens; and in a children's book that's golden.
B0041KKYCY|4.0|I honestly can't recall seeing the original movie so I won't compare the stories between the two.  This remake wasn't toned down at all in theme or footage, probably a good indication why the movie never hit theaters.  The rape sequence(s) was so incredibly disturbing I had to fast forward through it...couldn't watch it.  The rest is revenge fantasy and works well.  The ending cuts out making you wonder how far she would go for revenge and whether or not that would include the sheriff's pregnant wife and kid.  It's a good guess that for politically correct reasons they ended it there; not for a sequel.  Truth is that this was a well made movie and the only truly horrific thing in the movie is the scope of human nature and behavior.  It leaves you feeling that the revenge, despite it's gruesome nature, was justified.
B000BVXC7Q|3.0|It would be a shame if someone coming new to Richard Strauss purchased this hefty 9 disc set and then would summarize this composer's orchestral work based solely on Kempe's recordings here. Since this set is now out of print, it's harder to acquire but I remember that it was promoted heavily on this site and in some critics' circles as the go to Strauss orchestral summary. There are some riches to be found on these CDs but also a lot of it is second rate compared to fiercer Strauss advocates such as Karajan, Reiner and Solti. I'll detail the contents of each disc and share my thoughts about where Kempe succeeds and where a listener might attain more insight from another maestro.     CD 1 - Here we have the two Horn Concertos, the Oboe Concerto and the Duet Concertino. Dennis Brain on EMI made a famous record of the Horn Concertos and that would be the primary competition. But since that is in mono sound, Peter Damm, the horn player for Kempe here, can rest easy. These are vivacious performances. I have never been very found of the Oboe Concerto and the Duet Concertino, so all I can say is good work since I've rarely listened to any other versions.     CD 2 - Some rather bizarre concerto pieces here to fill in the gap. The Burleske has been recorded frequently. Argerich has one on DVD, Gould also has one on CD. Peter Rosel, the pianist for Kempe acquits himself well but I would pick Byron Janis with Reiner as the one to beat. Moving on to the Parergon zur Sinfonia Domestica for piano left hand and orchestra. This is a concerto play on themes from the tone poem Sinfonia Domestica. The Parergon is not a major piece by any means and suffice to say, this is a fine account. Now to the Panathenaenzug for left hand piano and orchestra. Ridiculous title. The form of the piece is Symphonic Etudes in the form of a Passacaglia. I love passacaglia and variation form and this strange work is quite a delight. It is 27 minutes of blissful episodes. After a big opening statement, it descends into lovely, melodic, free-wheeling, almost jazzy variations. A different Strauss for sure. Rosel and Kempe keep the tempo lively and I was very pleased. For sure, 27 minutes is too much for such a piece but it's such a carefree delight, it might win over a number of listeners.     CD 3 - Here we start getting to some of the meatier works. Till Eulenspiegel is a romp that is not raucous enough in Kempe's good natured account. My favorite current version is Haitink but there are plenty of others. Next is Don Juan. Once again Kempe is firmly second rate without the polish, virtuosity or the heroic abandon needed for such a vibrant work. My preference is for Solti first and then Karajan second. Now onto the big show with Ein Heldenleben. Kempe underplays the music throughout. If you never heard any other conductor, you wouldn't know that this is fire breathing music that shook up the musical world upon it's premiere over a century ago. Karajan is the man for the occasion here without exception. He has three studio Heldenlebens and all put Kempe to shame. There is also Reiner, Solti, Rattle, Thielemann and Ormandy just to start with. All are leagues above the Kempe account.     CD 4 - The early Violin Concerto, dating from the years before Strauss became Strauss is good for a listen. But when we get to the grand Sinfonia Domestica, Kempe fails another major test. It's a warm, humane account but one that falls flat in comparison to the great Domesticas. Please go and find Karajan's miraculous Domestica on EMI. It is a stupendous feast of orchestral virtuosity, a tour-de-force performance that pits the Sinfonia Domestica as one of the greatest showpieces of the late romantic era. Furtwangler also has a great performance, so altogether Kempe can't compete with the best.     CD 5 - Zarathustra is up first. Kempe relinquishes all spectacle in favor of simplicity and good spirits. That might be enough for some. But if you want a blockbuster Zarathustra, it's Karajan again. Also try the famous Reiner from 1955, still in great sound. Up next is Death and Transfiguration, Kempe is easily bested by the likes of Karajan, James Levine and the unknown Tolga Kashif, all putting much more energy and intensity into this life and death tone poem. To round out the disc, Kempe made an arrangement of the famous waltzes from Der Rosenkavalier. This is a terrific selection and the Dresdeners play with style and gusto. But almost 18 minutes of waltzes can be too much of a good thing.     CD 6 - The Dance of the Seven Veils is sheer lighting under Solti and Reiner. Kempe cannot compete here. The Suite from Le Bourgeious Gentilhomme is music I avoid since it is a lot of mush over nothing. If one must have it, Reiner has the best account on disc. The excerpt from Schlagobers is Strauss at his creampuff worst. Then the suite from Josephslegende. Kempe is number one in this suite since it is recorded very rarely. The music is very superficial but contains some lush melodies.     CD 7 - The Metamorphosen for strings is Strauss at his most elevated. Too bad Kempe doesn't seize the moment here. For my money, no one has ever equalled Furtwangler and Karajan in this masterpiece. They are leagues above Kempe. The big show on disc 7 is the gigantic Alpine Symphony, this is cinematic music before that became a bad thing. Kempe humanizes the piece and plays it with the utmost dignity. This is one of his major successes in this set even though I still prefer the spectacular Herbert von Karajan version over all others.     CD 8 - The early Aus Italien symphonic fantasy gets a wonderful performance from Kempe and I would rank it among the best ever. Then Macbeth is also a winner, due mainly to the fact that this out of the way tone poem doesn't have much recorded competition.     CD 9 - Don Quixote is one of Strauss's greatest tone poems. Too bad it doesn't sound that way under Kempe, once again underplayed and lacking romantic ecstasy. One can easily turn tothe dream team of Rostropovich/Karajan on EMI to hear what this music is all about. Finally, the dance suite after Couperin is not a piece I've heard in any other capacity, so I just throw my hands in the air and say good enough.     To summarize, if you are looking for the best Strauss has to offer, you should investigate other conductors. Karajan does great things with Death and Transfiguration, Zarathustra, Ein Heldenleben, Don Quixote, the smashing Sinfonia Domestica and the Alpine Symphony. Reiner is great in Zarathustra and the Burleske. Solti awesome in Don Juan. Haitink superb in Till Eulenspiegel. Furtwangler is first choice in Metamorphosen and Karajan second.     Rudolf Kempe's major successes in this box set are these... an outstanding Aus Italien, a well done Macbeth, a ripe and humane Alpine Symphony, a delectable collection of waltzes from Rosenkavalier and the finest recording of the Josephslegende suite. One also can't forget the Panethezunaenzug symphonic etudes, which is just charming music to my ears. The sound quality throughout is good analogue stereo. Overall, this collection is too average in the great works to get a recommendation. Too many critics have steered listeners onto this set for reasons unknown to me. A lot of it is very mediocre. Great Strauss is easy to find, seek out my suggestions.
B004A8ZWSS|3.0|This is a very generic \\"what a twist\\" movie.  It's not particularly bad but it's not good either.  If they gave Depp more to work with the movie would've been better; I'm sorry but a dumb Depp doesn't work, that's like casting Nick Cage in a serious drama.  Looks, sounds, and is acted really well...just doesn't go where you want it to go, in fact, it doesn't go anywhere.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|Loved it! Saw it in the theater for a class on politics and bought it the day it came out--made me want to study finance more to understand the complex machine we created. The distinguished cast of scholars and policymakers interviewed is a testament to their belief in the quality of the film.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love to read and was the one who carried around ALL the books I was currently reading.  Anyone else who reads know that's a real back breaker!  I have this app on all my major reading electronics ( my Cruz Tab, my pc,  my Android phone and Galaxy Tab). Renders well on all except G. Tab. The splash screen is off,  so it doesn't fit screen.  Love having all my books with me at all times, love I can read whatever whenever however whyever... lol.  Syncs flawlessly,  adjustable fonts, different lighting levels... ;)  Only thing it needs are real page numbers and real in book dictionary.  NEVER liked the Kindle ereader cause I believe it you're gonna drop hundreds on electronica it better do more than one ghing... JMO.  Great app! Thanks!
B00005JMXX|1.0|I saw it for speical effect but the story is a 1000 flaws.  Some are do dumb that I stayed to watch the retarded ending with is 'always blame America'. A horric cold spell happens that freeze people and machines in seconds yet wolves fun around like it is 40 degrees.  The classic flaw is when the father (completely forgot his name) actually walks from Washington DC and finds his son in the main library.  And, for politically correntness, there is a homeless black guy that just pumping out ghetto wisdom that saves the day.  The klutz who is clearly Dick Chaney repeats of his ways and thanks Mexico for illegal immigrantion.

0316067938|1.0|I never thought I'd manage it, but I finally achieved the impossible: I trudged through the endlessly infuriating tome that was Breaking Dawn for god only knows what reason and managed to come out alive.<br /><br />I don't really know what to say. I hate the self-serving characters, I hate the pretty ribbon that ties up every single relationship and every single issue perfectly, and I hate the anticlimactic everything that sums up this series. Bella and Edward remain intact, they never learn a damn thing about themselves or each other or anybody else. Bella gets everything she wants and then some, as do Edward and Jacob. Not only that, but the werewolves are magically revealed to not be werewolves after all! They're only shapeshifters, a ha ha. Never mind that they multiply in response to the influx of vampires the way werewolves supposedly do. And don't even get me started on Bella as a vampire. What a nice way for Meyer to eradicate any redeeming qualities whatsoever in a character by making her perfect: perfect beauty, perfect strength, a superpower so ridiculously perfect all I wanted to do was cry because of the vainness of it all.<br /><br />Here is a series that you should read if you've ever wondered: What would life be like if there was no awful? If everybody was perfect and everything turned out exactly like you wanted it to with very little struggle? What would life be like if all people were empty, character-less vessels who never learn anything and who have not even the slightest bit of introspection?<br /><br />This series saddens me primarily because of the mindless emptiness of it all. I can't understand why so many people would flock to a story that is so unchallenging and so impossibly sanctimonious.
B002ZG98Z0|3.0|SATC movies don't quite compare to the HBO series and SATC 2 was a bit painful to watch but as a fan I still enjoyed a few elements of it.<br /><br />SATC 2 picks up 2 years after the first movie. Carrie feels her marriage is coming out of the \\"honeymoon\\" phase, Miranda is unhappy with her job, Charlotte is having a hard time dealing with two kids and thinks her new nanny might be enticing her husband, and Samantha is dealing with menopause. When Samantha get an all expensive paid trip to the Middle East she invites the girls to join her and they all feel they could use an escape from the big city and their current situations.<br /><br />Now here's where it gets crazy: the lavish trip to the Middle East. 4 cars for 4 girls? Really? 4 butlers for 4 girls? An independent suite for each girl on the plane? Are these the only 4 individuals not affected by the economy?<br /><br />-The disrespect shown to the culture. The women cover themselves for a reason; there's no need to be prude about it.<br />-The ridiculous fashion. Who was the costume designer on set? I wanted to cover my eyes each time they did a wardrobe change. I don't think I liked anything the girls wore.<br />-Carrie's eyeshadow on her date with Aidan (first of all, who runs into their ex on another continent?) was a little too much.<br /><br />The best part of this film was that it's another SATC film and a chance to see a piece of the franchise again since I missed it so much from HBO, the lavish gay wedding, and the scenes from their trip. Even though the trip was a bit tasteless, it's still fun to imagine being at a far off destination.<br /><br />Overall, you will enjoy this movie if you're a fan but don't expect too much.

B004L49K2A|5.0|I'm a very big fan of Duran Duran from the beginning I think that there new CD All You Need Is Now is an excellent album by the band if your a true fan like I am you really will want this CD for you collection all the songs are cool they sound great also.this is the only CD version by the band thats in a plastic jewel case form to buy.
B0011UJMK2|3.0|This book started out very good for the first 100 pages then went down hill from there. I had a hard time finishing the book but I did. I wouldn't recommend this book for our book club but if you have some time to kill read the first 100 pages.

1589269071|5.0|I only heard about the 5 Love Languages recently......but it was held to such high esteem, in a group of high esteem.......that I ran out to buy it.  I was not dissappointed.  I am no longer married and it gave me pause to reflect that this knowledge would have made our marriage, or any new relationship happier.  Honestly......I have always known what is important for me in a relationship......well, there was one surprise.......however meerly knowing it and asking for it is not enough.  On this CD, Gary Chapman gives tools to implement happiness and fulfulling love in relationship........I have no doubt it works..........I am pondering his CD for children now......for my grand kids......so that they may feel loved from the start and not go looking for it in another as adults......  One last word.....it was well after I listened to the CD that I noticed the downloadable 'test' (in PDF form) so you can verify what your Love Language(s) are........that was the happiest of all surprises!  Everyone should have this information.

B004R0WKNE|1.0|I felt like there were large parts of this script which seemed to have gotten stuck in the copy machine. I generally like Ms. McAdams, but this was not her role.  In addition, the love story was a completely unbelievable laugher.  Also - i might add that it has perhaps the worst soundtrack I have ever heard.  Unimpressed.
B00000FCBC|3.0|it arrived WAY quicker then i thought maybe a week or 2.  but the CD case was broken... the CDs themselves and the containing artwark are all perfect though!
B001PJRAUS|1.0|When I saw this movie, I had just finished watching Tin Man and I was overjoyed to find something similar. So I watched this mini-series and immediately it was not what I thought it was going to be. The more I watched this movie, the more I wished I hadn't. It was the largest waste of time. There are no words to describe how horrible this was. If I want to read about some random OC hooking up with Darcy than I can read some crappy fanfiction and only wasted five maybe ten minutes of my life. I also hate the absolute assumption that any woman who stand up to Mr. Darcy and speak back is instantly going to win his heart. It's distasteful and a major slap to Jane Austen's work. Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth had a connection and it has been that connection that has inspired and awed millions. It's disrespectful and completely horrible. I wouldn't suggest it to anyone and I would warn them ahead of time before they watched it. It was worse than the third Harry Potter which was a complete disaster. I wouldn't recommend to my worse enemy and I certainly would sue if any lawyer would take my case. It was horrible and I hope no one who completely utterly loves the relationship and romance of Darcy and Elizabeth waste their time on their horrible piece of medium that some one called a movie.
0307272702|1.0|I bought this because I read a few pages on the product page and thought it was interesting how he was talking about the history of how people became obese and as I read, I enjoyed the first chapter but then it just went downhill for me. He started getting too scientifical and his idea that diet and excercise don't work, then why DOES it work for so many people? It makes sense to me. Maybe there are those people out there who are just obese without calories being the culprit, but for several others, it is. I don't like how he comes across that his idea is the right way and he wants doctors to agree with him. I felt uneasy reading this book and I skipped ahead to the diet he suggests. You can't eat hardly anything. I don't like depravation diets. I figured there's no way I'm doing that diet, I can't live that way and why should I read a book that makes me feel uneasy? I decided to get rid of it because it wasn't what I thought it was going to be. I thought it would be informative, but it is just a guy pushing his beliefs onto others.
B001IBIHQ4|4.0|Great series providing what appears to be a very insightful depiction of the time and the mind of everyday hero's.
B0011ZNAIC|1.0|It seems as though they made a list of every bee joke they could think of, and then designed a movie around it.   and then, when that didn't  make a movie that was long enough,  they go into this whole muddled lawsuit thing.  It's funny how kids seem to not like the movie when a grownup doesnt. and when the movie is well done, like cars, they love it.  And no,  they did not like this mess of a movie.
B004NSULHM|2.0|I long for the days when a new radiohead record would be a mindblowing experience (think the bends, ok computer or kid a.) In rainbows was an unqualified masterpiece that required patience. It revealed itself slowly; its subtle brilliance blossoming like a slow coloured sunrise. King of limbs may eventually reward the listener like in rainbows but I doubt it.<br /><br />TKOL's first half has a kid a synth, purcussive feel to it. It sounds stale and boring when compared to the alpha kid. They've been there and done that. The second half morphs into a more flowing and beautiful sound. Codex is brilliant. In rainbows contained a half dozen songs as good.<br /><br />I don't think The king of limbs is a bad record. At this point of their career, Radiohead is incapable of making lousy music. They just haven't made anything innovative and truly exciting in years. Radiohead's 2 stars would be 4 stars for anyone else. That's the problem with the standard they have set: A listener expects to see plenty of stars in the black canvas/sky of radiohead's brilliance.
B004KSQN7C|5.0|I really enjoy listening to britney Spears and her beautiful voice all the songs are awesome I am very happy with it.
B000FC1HBY|3.0|I really am a follower of Dany and Jon. The others provide minor distraction, but I don't really get too much into those story lines. Overall, this is an excellent text.
B004GYY714|5.0|Great app for anyone who like to listen to the radio,internet radio streams and podcasts.The controls are really simple and it has a feature that gives you other stations like the one you are listening do.Uses very little battery power so it is something you can use for many hours at a time.If you pay for XM/Sirius and can live without a couple of so called \\"radio stars\\" you will drop you service as soon as you get this.Hook up a blue tooth to your car or FM tramsmiter though your headphone jack and listen to this in your car.Alot of stations to choose from, quite awesome as everyone says.Some stations do have low bit rate but that is the stations decision not tuneins.
B000059T1G|5.0|The seller sent me the goods in excellent quality. The shipment of goods was completely new. The goods were delivered quickly and was not injured. I am a collector of the end of 60 CD and 70 years old years and the trade I am very satisfied. Thank you very much Otmar
B004GYY714|5.0|It is wonderful to be able to listen to nearly any station you want nationwide for free on your phone. I highly recommend.
B004LWZW24|3.0|I found that this movie was a little too familiar.  It seemed to steal bits and pieces from other horror movies - even way back to a brief scene in Rosemary's Baby (1968).<br /><br />It started kinda slowly and I felt the wife wasn't worried or afraid enough of the weird things that were happening to be believeable - but that may have been a case of bad acting.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT: I also thought it was a little dumb that the husband didn't lock the deadbolt on the front door but DID set the intrusion alarm and engage the little door chain after someone (unseen) knocked on the door. Inevitably, the door was open again moments later and the alarm was going off.  I guess locking it properly wouldn't keep a ghost out anyway... Still, for me, when the characters are acting like real life people would act, I find a scary movie more relatable and more scary (the old Black Christmas is still my favourite, for that reason).  When they do stupid things that no one would ever do in real life, the movie becomes just gratuitous scare tactics with no psychological component.<br /><br />I was pleased to see Barbara Hershey (The Entity) make an appearance here, since there were also similarities to her scary show (70's). I was wondering if she was chosen on purpose because of that.  I was half-waiting for a cameo by Bruce Willis(Sixth Sense) and JoBeth Williams (Poltergeist) since there were copycat shots from those movies, too. Someone younger is less likely to pick up on these similarities but I found them a little disappointing and distracting.<br /><br />Overall, an okay movie.  I probably will buy the DVD when it comes out, just because I like freezing the frame at all the scary monster scenes.  This movie had some very scary-looking characters that flashed across the screen in a burst of loud music and I enjoy seeing their costume and make-up more closely.  I also like watching the \\"making of\\" footage that many DVDs include.<br /><br />If I were to recommend this movie to someone, I'd say, \\"It was good.\\" while shrugging.hile shrugging.
0140067477|5.0|I loved the way in which this book is written, it explains in an easy way the tao philosophy and it also made me laugh.
B0041KKYBA|1.0|I looked forward to this based on reviews from non-Amazon sources.  It turned out to be typical of the predictable and shallow material spewed forth by the mass media.  There was nothing new in it if you have kept up with financial news at all.  It told only part of the story, completely ignoring the role GSE's played in this mess.<br /><br />NOT WORTH IT! (even used it is not worth the cost)
0670022411|1.0|This is a classical example of a bad novel. Zero original ideas, absolutely no plot development, one-dimensional characters and poor skills in story telling. The first one-third of this book is flat-out boring - I felt more emotionally attached to my morning paper. The second third contains enough action to hold a readers interest but mine was lost because of the absurdity of SF story lines intertwined. If you are not an adept in physical sciences, stay out of it - leave it to professionals (e.g. B. N. Strugatsky). Finally, the last third of the book is beyond any criticism! The author should have decided beforehand whether she wanted to write a fairy tale or a book for adults! The prince charming for the main character would be an acceptable choice for a fairy tale. However, in the beginning of the novel we were introduced to a vampire-warrior, which by the end of the book, was replaced by a flawless prince charming incapable to defend himself against a single bad-tempered female vamp!  In my humble opinion, this book has many flaws - I mentioned only few of them. But the main question a reader must answer is \\"will you be able to remember the context of the book in, lets say, a week or so?\\". I will not. The only thing I will remember is my own suffering caused by determination to finish this novel.
B003NHRGSQ|4.0|amazing follow up to the the first book shiver. linger was a book that made me root for the characters, cry for them, and fall in love with them. i recomended this book for all.
B004KPQK2S|2.0|This is a decent movie (definitely a Disney-fied attempt at great movie making), but not a great one. I didn't see the movie in when it was in theaters, and, in truth, I don't think I heard much about it during its run. I decided to watch the movie because of the low $1.99 price and the ratings. After watching it and reading some of the reviews, I wondered if many of the reviewers had watched another movie or have not seen a great sports or horse racing movie to compare it to. That said, if you want to see a great horse raising movie, and I do mean a great one, watch Seabiscut. It has all the elements of a great movie. It causes you to get emotionally involved with the characters, not just the lead actor or the horse, but with pretty much all of the characters. There is no comparison between the two except for the horses.    No with that behind me, here is my critique of the film. John Malkovich is a terrific actor. I've seen him in many films. Having said that, he should not have been in this one. At the very least, he should not have played a French Canadian. And if he did play a French Canadian, he should not have tried to speak French. Having seen him in several movies,it's clear that accents and languages are not his forte (se Rounders). He cannot do them convincingly. Instead, they become annoying and you want him to stop speaking.    Diane Lane was not very believable as this housewife suddenly cast unawares into the world of horse racing. As it turns out, there is good reason. It seems that the real owner was not new to horse racing or even owning winning horses. The movie tries to hit every emotional note, but fails. It almost seems as if there should be instruction telling you to cue the tears, or the laughter, or the nail biting. Let's take a look at this for a moment. Diane Lane plays a fictional character (I have to say fictional because she was nothing like the character she portrayed) who is willing to lose everything and possibly lose her family andmake them \\"beggars\\" simply because she wants to and feels that it is right. She makes decisions for the entire family then gets upset when they don't agree with her. This kind of ego and hubris is fine if you are single and you're the only one who suffers,but it's kind of hard to cheer for a character like that. I had the same problem with Will Smith's character in The Pursuit of Happiness. Yes, things turned out fine in the end, but how many other people with children who may try the same thing won't have the same success. The Diane Lane character, in my opinion, shares the same self focussed determination, not caring who suffers in the process.    Another problem with the movie is the choice of music. I like gospel like a lot of people, but the movie wasn't very stirring and it needed some better music. Again, it just seems like the makers through in every gimmick they could thing of without thinking of continuity or how well the pieces would fit together. Oftentimes, Hollywood (or Disney in this case) is more concerned about quantity, and much less about quality. This is a case where the latter should have been given more attention. It would have made for a better movie.
0385341679|4.0|...but I wouldn't recommend doing so with this series. It was a good deal on the shelf and I found the artwork intriguing, so I'm sucker for a good cover. The book was ultimately a good read, but there were certain references regarding characters and background that I had to piece together on my own. Once I got started and reading further into the novel, I was pretty much hooked. Switching between 'worlds' was off putting but only because once again, I didn't have the full content prior to reading. I truly enjoyed women being on equal footing with males. I wasn't beat over the head with a whole romantic side story. I do encourage you to read this book, but start at the BEGINNING. After reading the last, I don't even want to know the story prior to the fourth installment. I'm hoping there's a fifth in the series as I WILL purchase it in the future.
B001N1DPDE|2.0|First off I am a really sold Kabar fan and I own many of their knives and truly believe they offer great value items.     I have used and abused this knife in several camping trips trying to figure what was my preferred carry survival/bush craft knife. It is very well built and sturdy and is top notch quality as far as the blade is concerned. This being said, here is what I find wrong with this knife and why I will not be carrying this knife.    1)Too thick and heavy for its length. I like batoning and making stakes and other general camping chores. While it is true that a thick blade will break wood quicker, as soon as you hit larger size logs you will have to put a tremendous amount of effort getting the logs  to split enough to get use of the knife just because of blade length. I find that for the weight of the knife I am much better off bringing a bigger knife with a 9ish blade along with a small Mora or rat3 for the smaller tasks. With this knife I would both need a bigger AND a smaller one.     2)Handles:Just crappy and always loosening with vibrations from batoning. Thank god I had brought an Allen key with me in case or I would have been losing pieces quickly. Second there is no grip on the handles and they slip easy and if used in the winter they conduct cold really bad. Handles look cool but that's it. I am not a knife collector, I am a knife user so that does not suit me. So right there you gotta go for micarta handles and spend another 50$ on the knife.    I truly love the looks of the knife and I also have a bk9 and I truly wish they would have made the bk2 with a 3/16 blade and the bk9 with a 1/4 or a 5/16 like a trailmaster...what a beast that would be. Add micarta handles and a kydex sheath and send me the 200$ bill, I won't mind paying for quality all the way. Meanwhile, I'll just hop on ebay and get me an old trailmaster v5.

B004R96SPQ|5.0|If I Stay   From the back cover: In a single moment, everything changes. Seventeen-year-old Mia has no memory of the accident; she can only recall riding along the snow-wet Oregon road with her family. Then, in a blink, she finds herself watching as her own damaged body is taken from the wreck...   A sophisticated, layered, and heartachingly beautiful story about the power of family and friends, the choices we all make--and the ultimate choice Mia commands.  My thoughts...I loved this book. 90% of the time a book cover is what draws me to pick it up and read what it is about, and I loved this cover. This book had it all---I found myself laughing, crying, having my breathe taken away, my heart melting or  hurting, every human emotion I felt while reading this book. When reading the back cover you really don't know what this book is about, but after reading some reviews I went ahead and bought it.  Mia was in an accident that she has no memory of. You are with Mia as she pieces together what happened. She has an \\"out of body\\" experience. She can see and hear everything that is going on but that is it. She doesn't know how to get back in her body and she doesn't know if she wants too. As she is piecing together the present events, you learn about her past. The author flows in and out the present to past with ease. When something in the present triggers how she met someone, how she felt about someone, a characteristics that defines one of the characters or Mia herself you are brought back to the past to find out about that person and what they meant to Mia. You learn why every character in the story is important to Mia; how in one way or another Mia loves them and they are part of her, an extended family. In the end Mia has to decide will she stay alive, will she fight to be with all the people that love her, or will she go be with those of her family that died in the accident....the story keeps you on the edge to the very end, I had no idea which choice Mia would make....
0061726826|5.0|YA novels, whether they be falling under the fantasy genre or dystopian sub-genre, have suffered quite a rush of change lately. Truth be told, when I was younger I don't remember having the option of an \\"in between category\\" as young adult novels...it was either fantasy books for children such as Travers' \\"Mary Poppins\\" or Lynne Reid Banks' \\"The Indian in the Cupboard\\" or, when I grew into my teens, the more adult-like fantasy books with a lot of gore, complex sf/fantasy/horror settings, various society/moral issues being mishandled or whatnot.    So, here we have it, a few years later, a crack in the old pattern being made with Rowlings' Harry Potter and later on with the \\"big bang\\" Twilight, yet we are neither here nor there. True, these \\"(in)famous\\" series have brought to life, in my opinion, the true meaning of the \\"young adult novel\\", yet I am amazed to see that the 13 to 18 audience is grateful for such reads...It might be because I was reading quite the different type of books at that precise age, but somehow I was expecting YA novels to have a certain degree of \\"quality writing\\" and to emphasize some literary talent coming from its creators...    On this note, I would like to (actually) start my review by saying that Oliver is such a writer. The concept of the novel didn't blow me away, partially because we've seen something similar in 2002's \\"Equilibrium\\" movie and yet, Oliver manages to transcend cliché's barrier and masterfully conveys all the \\"delirious\\" feelings that are brought out in Delirium.    I see no point in sketching a summary of her tale, but I feel compelled to repeat the fact that \\"Yes, this woman can write!\\" and thus this YA novel is worth the read even for older individuals. I also feel obliged to ask the fellow reviewers on amazon why in the world are YA novels of such low standard being ranked as high as they are, while exceptional teen reads such as Oliver's Delirium (or Cassandra Clare's series or even Collins' Hunger Games if we areto compare it to Twilight's ratings) only \\"average\\" recommendations???    Miss Oliver, if by an unprecedented chance you happen upon this review, I would simply like to say \\"You deserve to be called a writer and I sincerely hope you will survive in a world were the majority of its readers (both young and old) are overwhelmed by mediocrity and rubbish!\\"

0307593495|1.0|The plot is excellent and true Menkell.  The prose, as usual, is succinct and enriching.  But the constant depressing backdrop of Wallander's musings upon age and encroaching forgetfulness made me increasingly angry as I progressed through the book.  I found myself turning pages without reading them to get back to the plot's unfolding.  The end positively enraged me as Menkell simply forgot how to write and in one bare, ill-written paragraph, consigned his faithful detective to the nether world of Alzheimer's.   I was stupefied.   Our house is full of thousands of books as we are a family of readers and I cannot resist carting books all over the world on business - and lugging them back home with me after I have read them.   I happily left this book in a hotel in Kenya.
B004E2XAHK|5.0|\\"The unforgiving\\" is the brand new, fifth studio album by Dutch female fronted symphonic rock/metal band \\"Within Temptation\\". \\"The unforgiving\\" is a concept album further accompanied by a series of short films and comics. As the nature and specifics of the concept have been extensively explored through various on-line sources, I would like to concentrate on the musical side of the release. The line up features lead singer Sharon Den Adel, the star of \\"Within Temptation\\", guitarists Robert Westerholt and Ruud Jolie, bassist Jeroen van Veen, and key-player Martijn Spierenburg. Drums are performed on a session basis by Jeroen Van Veen while Franck van der Heijden is responsible for choir and orchestral arangments.<br /><br />Style and sound wise, the album is a considerable departure from the gothic aesthetic of the previous studio release into a harder rocking approach. The symphonic element for that matter is consistent and-once again- a big part of the band's sound; stillthe song writing leans more towards melodic hard rock with emphasis on large choruses, big drumming classic sounding guitar riffs and more guitar solos/lead guitar parts than one would expect.Favirote tracks include \\"In the middle of the night\\", \\"Fire and Ice\\", \\"Iron\\", 'Shot in the dark\\" and \\"A demon's fate\\".<br /><br />One could as well claim (without being absolute) that there is an overall 80s orientation/influence on the album, identifiable on the lyrics, album cover, even song titles (\\"Shot in the dark\\", \\"In the middle of the night\\", \\"Fire and ice\\" etc). On a personal level I have to say I am very enthusiastic regarding the artistic direction of \\"The unforgiving\\" due to my delight for melodic hard rock; By retaining the symphonic element and blending it with hard rock one hopes that \\"The unforgiving\\" will be equally appealing to seasoned and new fans of the band alike.

1423101502|5.0|Nico's plan is crazy, but it may be the only plan that will effectively work to save Olympus - and the rest of the world.  So Percy Jackson, son of Poseidon, follows Nico and does the unthinkable - something only two other men have undertaken.  But now Olympus is under attack, and only the demigods are available to fight.  The gods themselves have left their thrones on Olympus to battle Typhon, the most powerful Titan, as he barrels his way across the U.S.  Percy is chosen to lead the demigods and every other stray group he can pull together. This kid has got a lot on his mind:  the prophecy, which has now been revealed to him; the many opposing voices and opinions that surround him; the lies that would be so easy to believe; Annabeth and Rachel; and now this whole army.  It is up to him, and him alone, to make to the choice that will save Olympus -  or bring the whole world tumbling down to Tartarus.<br />_________________________________________<br />My thoughts -<br />My thoughts?  My thoughts?!  My feelings, more like it!  I'm so sad because the series is over...and yet totally happy because the end was so satisfying.  It left me in amazement and awe as I set down the final installation to the insanely good series, Percy Jackson and the Olympians.<br /><br />At the beginning of this series, I would never have thought I'd feel this way.  The first three books are good, and enjoyable and fun and adventurous.  But when book four came around, I realized, \\"Holy moly, I'm attached to these characters and I didn't even realize it - and now the series is almost over!\\"<br /><br />The Last Olympian took me by surprise.  I had no idea, until the moment it happened, what was going to happen.  The prophecy hung over the story.  Percy was going to have to make a decision that would alter the fate of Olympus.  Many people were going to die.  Either Kronos or the gods would rule once Percy had made his decision.<br /><br />It was insane.  Packed to the brim with adventure, magic, and mystery - along with that lovely sarcastic sense of humor that makes Percy who he is - the last Percy Jackson book delivered.  More than delivered.  The end was perfect and exactly what I was hoping for.  It made me clap and laugh and it filled me with excitement.<br /><br />Favorite character (character notes) -<br />I always choose Percy as my favorite character, and this time is no exception.  However, this time I am unable to choose a supporting character that I prefer over the others.  They were all so amazing this time - really, I was surprised.  Nico had a great part in this story, a memorable one.  Annabeth was awesome, Grover, Silena, Chiron, the gods, and all the rest of the demigods...  It was as though they all made their grand finale performance - and all were memorable in some way.<br /><br />One thing I must add is that I LOVED the new characters introduced (whether for only a moment or for a few chapters).  I don't want to say any names because it might give something away...just know it was an amazing last addition to the cast and I was thoroughly impressed!  (I got to meet one of my favorite Greek heroes - it was amazing!)<br /><br />One last note on Percy...  Over time he has changed and grown and become a young man.  But in this book you see him as stronger, more intense - and yet still more tender than ever before.  It's hard not to totally respect and adore him.<br />Favorite aspects/scenes -<br />There is so much to love about this book.  It was, in every way, the grand finale to a grand series!<br />Favorite scenes include the River Styx, Hudson and East, the scenes with Morpheus (oooohh morpheous...), and, of course, the last scene in the second to last chapter, which made me giggle with joy!!!  (It had some of the best one-liners, which I will always remember!)<br /><br />Other aspects about this novel that I love:<br />Rick Riordan is a master at tying up loose ends.  He is a master of delving into the language of a teenager and making Percy a realistic boy in the 21st century.  I love the way he re-introduces the characters and how he sets up the premise of the story so quickly.  I love the atmosphere of The Last Olympian, among all the other books.  It was dark, chaotic, and yet almost dreamy.  Almost moist, like after a giant storm.  But really, the storm had yet to come.  And there is that sense of humor, that sarcasm that always prevails.  There are humorous situations that could be really cheesy - but Rick Riordan manages to make them hilarious, like laugh out loud hilarious!  There are some absolutely incredible heart-pounding edge of your seat battle scenes.  Each satyr, half-blood, and any other kind of creature fighting for the gods had his own part to play and affected the story in his own way.  They all worked together to bring this story to a climactic, unforseen ending that will leave you gaping.<br /><br />I mean, really.  It doesn't get any better.<br /><br />One word to sum up this book (and final thoughts) -<br />'I would describe this book as phenomenal.  Seriously, I was so impressed.  If you haven't read this series yet - you should.  They are rewarding, well-written, quality pieces of literature with a fun twist on Greek mythology.  They definitely deserve a round of applause.

B004S5D3B6|4.0|I am normally not a big fan of Christian Bale but he is the true star of this movie.  His Academy Award for \\"Best Supporting Actor\\" was well-deserved!  Like another reviewer said, it can be argued that the movie is more about Dicky, Micky's older brother, played by Christian Bale.  He is a former fighter whose claim to fame is that he \\"knocked out\\" Sugar Ray Leonard and put \\"Lowell(MA) on the map\\" as a result.  But now, he is a crack addict who is also the trainer for his younger brother, Micky.  Micky also comes from a huge Irish Catholic family with 5 or 6 sisters and a mom who acts as his manager.  The actress that played his mother should have also won an Academy Award.  She is a mother that refuses to \\"see\\" that Dicky is a drug addict and makes it pretty clear that Dicky is her favorite son.  She is also Micky's manager although she often makes poor decisions that hurt his boxing career. Finally,yes, the story is predictable: man is down-and-out, meets a pretty girl, and gets determined to FIGHT and WIN. But hey, it's based on a true story so you can't really argue about the plot line.  The acting is stellar by everyone in the cast including Mark Walhberg and Amy Adams.  If you liked Cinderella Man, you will enjoy this movie.

It really encourages exploring and improving and looking with new eyes.  Wonderful book!
044656740X|3.0|This book is about financial literacy, a topic that is not taught in any formal school curriculum. Rich parents, the authors argue tend to teach those skills to their kids, whereas middle class/poor parents tend to stick to the old mantra of working harder for success. The central idea revolves around analyzing one's personal finances, as corporations do, in terms of an income statement (P&L) and a balance sheet. The key then is to buy assets that will continually strengthen one's income. As the author's best put it: \\"The rich by assets. The poor only have expenses. The middle class buys liabilities they think are assets.\\"<br /><br />Below are some of my favorite excerpts from the book:<br /><br />1) \\"Losers avoid failing. And failure turns losers into winners. Just remember the Alamo.\\"<br /><br />2) \\"Today, I often meet people who are too busy to take care of their wealth. And there are people who are too busy to take care of their health. The cause is the same. They're busy, and they stay busy as a way of avoiding something they do not want to face. Nobody has to tell them. Deep down they know.

Working hard for money is an old formula born in the day of the cave men.\\"<br /><br />4)\\" Many people only manage people they feel smarter than and they have power over, such as subordinates in a work situation. Many middle managers remain middle managers, failing to get promoted because they know how to work with people below them, but not with people above them.

And that is financial intelligence.\\"<br /><br />An easy and insightful read into the area of personal finance.

0375842209|3.0|In some ways The Book Thief is a typical WWII story showing the devastation and human toil of Hitler's policy. Liesel, the daughter of communists is sent to live with foster parents since her father has disappeared and her mother's life is crumbling. Hans and Rosa are loving foster parents with Hans showing affecction and Rosa acting as the disciplinarian. The family eventually takes in and hides a Jew, Liesel develops friendships with various townspeople, and develops a love for books that sends her down a path of stealing them when various opportunities arise. What sets this book apart is the narrative voice of death.<br /><br />This has everything in it that should engender an enthusiastic response on my part: set in WWII, a precocious young girl, a lovable character in Rudy, an incredibly creative point of view, a theme of the importance of words. After reading a multitude of reviews, I was expecting great things. Yet, my response is tepid at best. Why? I'm not sure. While there were promising moments , I never became totalled absorbed by the story. I loved the character of Rudy but the characters, relationships, theme, and storyline never seemed to fully develop to its potential. I will say that Zusak's personification of death was the best part of the book. I loved how tired Zusak made death appear and thought the dark humor was appropriate.<br /><br />It is a good book, but I think there are so many others out there that are better
B004G600A4|1.0|Spoiler Alert--I'd like to address a key point to this movie that I haven't seen anyone mention. It has to do with how Rapunzel escapes a life of unhappiness with the woman who has been pretending to be her mother all her life...the boyfriend makes the choice for her. In one fell swoop he takes away the one thing that makes her unique and powerful, all under the guise of having done it for love. Just one of the many missteps of the movie--the fake mom is abusive; the love interest is a thief; above all else, beauty and youth must be maintained; long golden locks = power and short brown hair = not...etc. And then we wonder why our kids are nuts.
0385341008|5.0|Everytime I read a review on this book I would scratch my head and feel like I couldn't get a grip on what the book was about.  I imagine my review will leave many with a similar feeling.

Juliet, who wrote under a nome de plume during the war is lost, both personally and professionally, and is looking for a subject.  She comes into contact with a resident of Guernsey and learns about the origin of The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Society.  Here she thinks she has found a story.  The Germans have come to occupy the outter islands of the English Channel and Guernsey is one of them.  Under false pretenses, the society is formed and what emerges is a supportive network that pull together and is willing to make sacrifces.<br /><br />There are so many things to love about this book.  Written as an epistolary novel we come to really know these character as they answer questions about life during the occupation but also give us a glimpse into their everyday lives.  The characters are quirky, kind and lovable.  I would normally criticize a book that portrays characters in such laudable terms with virtually no character flaws.  However, since we get to know the characters through the letters of loved ones I think it makes sense.  The story also shows how literature can affect lives in various ways.  One of my favorite quotes: \\"That's what I love about reading:  one tiny thing will interest you in a book, and that tiny thing will lead you onto another book, and another bit there will lead you onto a third book.  It's geometrically progressive-all with no end in sight, and for no other reason than sheer enjoyment.\\"  (12-13)<br /><br />*****Possible Spoiler******<br /><br />But what I really appreciated was the way that we get to know Elizabeth, who only shows up in descriptions through letters wihtout appearing personally.<br /><br />***End of Spoiler****<br /><br />When I posted that I would be reading this there were several recommendations to listen to on audio.  Unfortunatley, I had already bought the book.  I could see how this would be great in audio form.  =*    When I posted that I would be reading this there were several recommendations to listen to on audio.

Her characters had full and interesting stories and backstories. This was a smart read. As a grown-up Harry Potter fan, I found this book satisfying, and like others said, I look forward to next book. I'm a big witch fan and enjoyed her well-developed view of these magical creatures. I'm new to werewolves, and found her development of their long history such a fascinating idea, as well as their families. Give this great read a chance!

That being said, I would not recommend this to a first time Coelho reader.  But if you enjoy his work, this is an interesting read since he admits it is written in a female alter ego and is based on personal experience in a mental instittue.  He also interjects himself in the story in a creative way.  Just beware it is not the lyrical story he typcially weaves.

It is a tough story to summarize without spoiling the plot, but the overview is that two U.S. Marshals arrive at this island, host to a hospital complex for the violently criminally insane, to help track down an escaped \\"patient\\". When that person is reported found (100 pages later) with no fanfare, we began to suspect that something on the island was not on the up and up, and as the book proceeds, we depart further from normality until a very surprising ending we dare say catches most readers totally off guard.<br /><br />We understand most of the author's works are more classic whodunit's - based on this outing, we would probably be willing to give one a try even though this book was not totally to our taste in the mystery/thriller genre. Some complain that it is too much like a screenplay - we hadn't seen the movie and at most will wait for the DVD !
B001QOGYBI|5.0|After I watched the abomination that was \\"Batman and Robin\\" , I decided to swear off any and all movies that had Mr. George Clooney in it.  This movie is based on the book by Roald  Dahl.  I haven't read any of Dahl's books, but I did enjoy this movie about Mr. Fox and friends stealing from three nasty farmers.  All of the characters use the word \\"cuss\\"  in place of a swear word.  This movie is sure to delight children and adults alike.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|For my Mini Euro trip to London, Paris, and Amsterdam, I needed something solid that could carry all my gear(Canon 50mm f/1.8, 18-55mm and 55-250mm kit lens, Rokinon 8mm f/3.5 Fisheye, Canon T2i, couple memory cards, 5 batteries, Alienware M11X, power cords and chargers, cell phone, lens cleaners, sunglasses, iPhone, maps, at least one travel book(Frommer's), two water bottles, and a couple bags just in case of rain. Well let me tell you, this bag held all of these items and help up great over a two week period! I wasn't sure on the size when I first ordered it. I wanted a bag that would fit conveniently under the seat while on my plane rides and something that wouldn't be so big to knock people over while I'm snapping pictures. This thing is the perfect size! It fit perfectly, held everything, held up to being thrown around and loaded to the rim with stuff. I had no issues whatsoever. For the price, you CANNOT go wrong with this bag! It even rained on me a bit, a sprinkling for a couple hours of walking, but water never entered the bag! I still carried plastic bags just in case, but if you're stuck without them, you don't necessary have to worry too much. Padding was sufficient. Plenty of room to add more if needed, which I did not.     Highly recommend this bag. I would rate this as a \\"Best Bang For Your Buck\\" type item. If you're wondering whether it will hold a laptop the answer is yes, up to a certain point. My advice would be to not go over anything larger than a 13 inch Macbook(circa 2006). It fits my Alienware M11X perfectly. There is just barely enough room for the Macbook. Also be careful sitting it down when your laptop is in the front pocket. No protection does leave it a bit vulnerable. This thing exceeded my expectations and couldn't have asked for more. If you're looking for something that isn't flashy and doesn't scream,\\"steal me!\\", this is it.

B000NIVJEU|1.0|After reading the book, I should have made the educated guess that this movie wouldn't be that good. It's hard to believe, but the movie is actually worse than the book. While that is the case for most movies, one would think you couldn't go much worse with this movie. The story has great potential, so I was hoping that the author's youth could be made up for with someone else writing the script. This was not the case. Save yourself some money and time and don't buy, rent, borrow or whatever this movie (or the book). There are plenty of other great fantasy movies out there that will better occupy ones time.

0061914177|4.0|You may agree or disagree with the message or the delivery, but one thing for sure, just as in person, you'll be hard pressed to call the book or any presentation that Gary gives boring. \\"Crush It!\\" is one third a biography, one third a motivational book, and one third a blitz introduction to \\"social media marketing\\". I can't say that Gary introduces us to any radically new concepts, but it is a quick read and a great introduction to how you can leverage the new \\"social media\\" channels to \\"hustle\\" your way to the top. If names such as Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr and YouTube sound familiar, but you're just not quiet sure how to leverage them for your business, then this is the book for you.
B0018AK9RA|4.0|This is one of the best progressive rock /concept albums/rock operas that I have ever heard. While unique to the genre and Judas Priest's impressive catalogue/career, many worthy comparisons to other artists is necessary. Overall, this is Judas Priest; however, one can clearly hear a deeply rooted classical influence and even that of the opera. Lyrically speaking, the music possesses the intelligence found in Queensryche, Dio and Dio era Black Sabbath and Rainbow. It is both smart and poignant. Very ambitious and theatrical in the vein of Hackett/Gabriel Genesis, the scope/breadth of this release is striking. The twin guitar sound we've grown to expect from Downing and Tipton is here and we definitely hear their respective styles; yet much of what they do in Nostradamus cannot help but remind one of Yngwie Malmsteen. There are some great acoustical moments and string arrangements here. When plugged in, the playing is fast (even thrash like at times), sometimes slow (one song is doom metal slow), soft and heavy. Thematically, one notices at once the similarity to Aphrodite's Child (the album 666),not to mention the sensibilities of Dante Alighieri, but that is where the similarity ends. Apocalypse, Exile, and Prophecy are all handled musically like no one else. Halford's voice is still amazing considering how long he's been at the helm. Like Downing and Tipton's guitars, his range is quite versatile. Early on in Act II, Halford sounds like David Byron (Uriah Heep)on one track singing really high/way up there. The production is excellent. This is a must own for any serious Judas Priest or progressive rock/concept album junkie like myself. While Judas Priest started out as a progressive rock band (if you consider about half of Rocka Rolla and much of Sad Wings of Destiny fit this category), this release is a far cry from those early recordings albeit very good ones. Nostradamus is a testament to a band not wanting to rest on its laurels, but one willing to try something new. They succeed at it very well.

0684135051|1.0|Do not acquire  this book nor any of EZ books if you are looking for material to learn about knitting.  Such a sorry disappointment. If you like to read autobiographies, then Zimmerman's books are for you. This woman has written more about her travels thru the beauty of summer vacations than knitting. How this book could possibly be helpful for a knitter at any level is beyond me. When I knitted sweaters for my boys throughout their years, no books. Now I return to knitting and decide I must have been missing very important facts that should have been available 50 years ago. I cannot stress strongly enough how all of Zimmerman's books are meant to be read for entertainment. Today there are many well written books authored by people, whom I believe arrived at this conclusion and voila informative knitting material is available. I will donate EZ books books to the library. A great waste of money. Knitting is an art as well as a necessity. I am more interested in locating information related to knitting skills developed by the Eskimos as that would be more in line with those sweaters I knitted years ago. Who writes these reviews? Book sellers. To date I find information made available by Interweave Press, amoung others who provide information that makes for relaxing knitting. So if you wish to read about how Zimmerman determined to create a few new stitches(and you will need to read a lot of I cord information) then she deserves to be recognized for this contribution. Otherwise go and buy travel books that are up to date along with the wonderful information from bright knitters of today. Sad but true. P.J. Today

B0034G4OY0|4.0|When I rented the movie, I kind of expected a typical story about psychics (very supernatural, mysterious, etc.).  However, this movie is more down to earth than that.

B0043RSJ8G|5.0|I am a huge fan of Ms. Picoult's because she writes about controversial issues with a richness few authors have.  She made the characters in this novel come to life, but more so she caused me to really consider how I feel about the issue of gay rights and marriage.    You truly don't know who to root for when the issue of frozen embryo's comes to light.  On the one hand there is the loving couple of Zoe and Vanessa, on the other there is the religious, right wing, conservative couple that are the brother and sister-in-law of the embryo's father, Max.  Who is to say which  couple would provide a better home for these unborn babies?  Throw a little bit of the church in there and you have the makings for a novel that I couldn't put down.    There is alot of contoversial \\"stuff\\" in this novel.  I only can say, read it with an open mind and heart.

B002ZG98G4|1.0|It was probably the third worst movie I've seen.  It spent the entire movie moving from one dissatisfied person to another.  It was a complete downer until the very end.

B003UESJFG|5.0|I've seen this movie four times in two weeks. The last time I loved a movie enough to watch it that many times was in 1987, at the age of 13.  I'm 37 now, and much more critical about quality in movies than I was then, and I tell you now that Megamind is a brilliant film.    They Got It Right.  This movie incorporates the best elements that we've all seen before, remarkably few flaws, and turns out a hilarious, intelligent movie with a lot of heart. And kid-safe, too, although adults will get a lot more of the in-jokes.     First, the humor.  This movie is just plain fun to watch!  Just the right balance between silly-slapstick and witty irony, lots of hilarious one-liners, references to other sci-fi films and comics, and, rare for an animated film, tiny subtle shifts in body language that betray what a character is thinking without any words necessary.      Next, the characters.  All five of the main characters have a surprising amount of depth, making it easy to empathize with them, in part due to the gorgeous animation and incredibly realistic facial expressions.  Megamind in particular has very expressive eyebrows, and you can literally see wrinkles appear in his forehead when he's upset, or smile lines in his cheeks when he gives that irrepressibly gleeful grin of his...you can't help but love him.        The Story:  Megamind begins the movie as a mischievous, fun-loving, blue-skinned alien super-genius with a crush on pixie-haired reporter Roxanne Ritchi, (whose cameraman, Hal, also has his sights set on her) and a love of playing \\"the game\\" with the other (human-looking) resident alien, Metroman.  Metroman is not the typical Superman clone he appears to be at the beginning, either.        Having been raised in the city prison, Megamind is inexperienced, almost innocent, about many things in the outside world, which is one more reminder for us of his outsider status despite his being culturally of Earth. His only companion is his best friend Minion, a loyal fish sent with him to Earth who wears a robot gorilla suit.        The Twist:  When Megamind unexpectedly wins the \\"game\\", he is at a loss.  A surprise meeting with Roxanne while in disguise as a handsome museum curator abruptly changes the course of his life (and this movie!) Megamind experiences a phenomenal amount of character growth, a coming-of-age that is rife with hilarious zaniness and agonizing drama with a show-stopper finale ends on an incredibly satisfying note.     There are several extras you'll want to check out; all the standard stuff plus a sweet-sad deleted scene, an animated comic book that lets you see some of the past battles between Megamind and Metroman, and a 16-minute short adventure (Button of Doom, either included on the Blu-ray or make sure to get the DVD set that has it!), set after the movie that has Megamind hilariously battling one of his own inventions!        Gorgeous animation: The sheer amount of rich detail in this film make it worth watching many times. I highly recommend the Blu-ray, though, I watched a dvd version and you couldn't make out details like young Megamind's sheepish, sad-yet-hopeful smile in the class picture.  And unlike several other reviewers, I didn't notice any aliasing at all, and I looked for it.    All the characters have such tender attention to detail, including fingerprints, realistic freckles, and eyes that reflect different colors from the sources of light around them.  I'm not a fan of weapon design, but Megamind's De-gun (a ray gun that has multiple functions, including dehydrating animate objects instantly so they shrink into small cubes) has what looks like decorative bronze insets in graceful curves, truly lovely to behold.  The glass catwalks in the museum are beautiful, too.      Who won't care for Megamind?  In middle of the film is light on action and things blowing up, as Megamind learns to care for Roxanne while developing a plan centered around Hal, which could bore some die-hard action fansor young children.        I also appreciate the lessons taught: The choices you make control your destiny, not fate.  Intelligence will win out over brawn.  Prejudice is wrong and unfair.  Forgiveness.  Redemption.  When life gives you lemons, make lemonade...or giant robots!
0439023513|4.0|I have loved reading the Hunger Games Trilogy. I am a middle school teacher, and my students introduced me to these books. When I picked up Hunger Games I couldn't stop reading until I knew what happened in the end. I have to say that while I loved the first two this book, Catching Fire, left something to be desired for me.  I loved the beginning, I thought the strife that Katniss was enduring was completely appropriate for someone battling with PTSD. I enjoyed finding out more about Finnick and getting closer to Prim. I enjoyed Gale and Haymitch and their polarizing roles when it came to Peeta.  I just wish that Suzanne Collins hadn't all but ruined Peeta for me. He was my favorite character, and what happens to him and through him what happens to Katniss, is gut wrenching. But not in an appropriate way that flavors the plot; its so unnecessarily painful when coupled with all of the other tragedy that Katniss faces throughout the story. Peeta should have remained the same. It was almost like introducing a new character.  I was so disappointed at first, and then even more disappointed with the resolution. Peeta goes from one extreme, to almost back to normal with no real progression. If his transformation back into himself was supposed to be dramatic and plot shaping, I found it weak and underdeveloped.  All in all, this book is still wonderful. As a fan of \\"distopian\\" literature, The Road being one of my favorite books, I was hoping for something a little more bright and hopeful from a young adult novel.

I have changed the way I eat according to what I now know about the mechanisms at work in our bodies beginning with the ones that control blood sugars.  My awareness has jumped a hundredfold, and my behavior follows.  Brilliant!

0439023491|3.0|Warning, this review will contain major plot spoilers for both the second and third book.<br /><br />In all honesty, this book started out strong. You had immediate tension. In the first few pages we were finally introduced to the master villain who was only a mere shadow in the first book. And President Snow is as terrifying as he is repulsive, an excellent combination in a nemesis. Katniss is being punished for her impulsive actions of the first book, which have started a spark of rebellion in the other districts. Adding to the stress of a victory tour that she must take, which includes traveling to the districts of children that both Peeta and Katniss killed, Katniss must both pretend to be desperately in love with Peeta and make up for her use of the berries in the first games.<br /><br />The victory tour was intense. I was on an emotional rollercoaster ride while reading it. Collins handles the tension and raw emotional scenes beautifully. I found, more than once, my grip on the book tightening as I was fretting with Katniss over her family's safety and the general wellbeing of the rebelling districts. The victory tour was both hauntingly believable and yet equally and unimaginatively cruel. Just the idea of being paraded in front of the families and friends of fellow lost participants, participants that were in some cases killed by either one or the other of them, is unfathomable. And yet Collins handled herself masterfully. I really must sing her praises now, because I won't have anything to sing about in the next book.<br /><br />The one major grievance I had in the first half of this book was the needless love triangle. When handled well, love triangles can add complication to a story. When handled poorly it serves only as a distraction, a mere blind from the story itself and the things that actual matter. Though I understood Katniss' conflicted feelings for both Gale and Peeta, I did not understand Gale's. Peeta was very direct and honest about his feelings. Gale however only exhibited them when Katniss jumped out of his reach (which was an interesting delve into his character, don't get me wrong). I was actually under the impression that after they kissed and Katniss made no comment, that Gale had given her up. She didn't return the affections and it was a lost cause. Because I tell you what, if you kiss someone and they don't kiss you back, there is no greater turn off in the world- it's heart breaking. It's the \\"I love you\\" with a proceeding awkward silence. I would have expected Gale to start hating Katniss. But instead he pines after her, which is beyond my understanding.<br /><br />It's Jacob with Bella all over again.<br /><br />Finally the victory tour is over and it's one emotional bombshell drop after another. BOOM! She failed to stop the spark of her rebellious actions from catching and now her family is in grave danger. BOOM! Gale is whipped to nearly an inch of his life. BOOM! She has to go back and relive the Hunger Games all over. Wait what?<br /><br />Now I liked this and I will tell you why... It was completely unexpected. You thought that after Katniss finished the first Hunger Games that there was no way that she'd have to go back. It flipped your and her world upside down. It was an ultimate plot sucker punch.<br /><br />However, in the next book review, I will explain how Collins becomes a one trick pony. After you pull this off once, doing it a third time will not create the same effect. And in fact it will cheapen your story. But this isn't a review for the third book, this is the review for the second.<br /><br />Eventually Katniss composes herself and resolves to sacrifice her own life for Peeta's during this year's games. She conspires once again with Haymitch to make this happen. It's a noble cause. And we can see that Peeta has plans that are exactly the opposite. But they're both setting off into this year's games with a definite purpose.<br /><br />It's the games all over again. I won'tbore you with the unnecessary details. You can read the book yourself if you so wish. They meet new former champions. We get a brief look into Haymitch's own Hunger Games which to me... were disappointing. For such a heavy drinker, I was expecting there to be something in his games to drink about. But in all honesty, though his games were rough- I didn't think they merited the excessive drinking that he took to. He seemed a strong guy to begin with. I expected something deep and dark to be at the core of his drinking.<br /><br />For one of those special Quarter Quell games, Haymitch's was just overly disappointing. Just an average hunger games with more people dying. Visually this would have been horrifying to witness. But in written form, its just a bunch of nameless and faceless kids dying off screen.<br /><br />If I were Collins, I would have gone for a Of Mice and Men approach. Haymitch should have killed the girl from his own district. And that should have been what has been eating him up inside all these years. And this is how it should have gone down. The other districts should have had some real tyrants that year. Perhaps they were more bloodthirsty than normal. Maybe they enjoyed torturing the other tributes. Haymitch teamed up with the girl from his own district. When it comes down the line to the remaining tributes, his teammate ends up injured. Haymitch then realizes has to make a choice. Protect the girl at the expense of his own life. Let the girl get killed by the bloodthirsty tributes. Or kill her himself mercifully. Perhaps it even somewhat mirrors Katniss' own decision with the berries. But Haymitch decides to kill the girl before the other tributes can. He succeeds but it tears him up inside. Katniss could have watched this video with Peeta and been appalled by Haymitch's seemingly heinous act. While Peeta, on the other hand, could see why Haymitch did what he did and explain it to Katniss- how mercy comes in many forms.<br /><br />There's another reason why I would have introduced such a theme through Haymitch. Because this would have been a theme I'd carry on in handling either Katniss or Peeta's future fate. But since we aren't at that book yet, I'll continue this thought in the next review.<br /><br />But instead of this, we get some average recounting of a Hunger Games where the most Haymitch did was figure out how to use a force field to his advantage. In fact when Haymitch sees that they are watching his games, he doesn't even seem bothered. He seems almost proud- which annoyed me. And this is what he drinks to forget? Something he practically brags about? Here was a chance for us to really see a deeper side of Haymitch but instead all we get is a scrape along his superficial surface. Annoying. I thought Collins could have really handled that better.<br /><br />I do realize that in the last book it is revealed that the force field stunt got Haymitch's family killed. But I just felt that was a weak excuse of the author to explain his drinking. Why does he drink? Oh his entire family was killed by the bad guys. Never seen that before! Real original. It seemed a convenient excuse and just lazy on the author's part. If we never see Haymitch losing his family or never meet the family he loses, how can we sympathize with him? We are simply told that he lost his family. Well you and everyone else in this book, Haymitch. Suck it up. You're preaching to the choir.<br /><br />The interview was fantastic. Again it was intense bombshell after bombshell. Cinna's fantastic wedding dress design transforming into a mockingjay. And then Peeta's interview where he lied that Katniss was expecting a baby. All of these were fantastic twists of the plot. All of them captivating. And then the tributes standing in a line, united and holding each other's hands in the ensuing chaos. Beautifully done.<br /><br />But it was shortly after all this amazing work that things started slipping. And it all went south the instant Katniss got into the tube to head off into the arena. It is in that scene where Katniss watches helplessly as her friend Cinna is violently brained and then dragged out of the room that the dignity of the series is dragged out with him.<br /><br />Up until that point I was really enjoying the book. Sure it had its faults but what book is perfect? I was willing to forgive the faults for the awesome parts. I did not disagree with this scene per say. But this is the very last scene where I was okay with this book. I understood that Cinna had to die, on an author's standpoint. But I am never a fan of killing characters off screen. Especially main characters. Unless the character is not actually dead, to kill a character off screen is to leave the possibility that they are not actually dead. Because we weren't given a definite death scene, it leaves a character's fate up in the air.<br /><br />Collins is notorious for killing characters off screen and then mentioning in one brief offhand sentence that they are dead. Haymitch's family. The girls (I think one's name was Bonnie?) that were fleeing to the 13th district. Cinna. The red headed mutes that served Katniss and Peeta when they were tributes. Peeta's family. Not to mention most of District 12... Some of these off screen character deaths are forgivable. But several of them irked me. The fleeing girls for one. Why even introduce them if you, as an author, won't care to write out their fate. Even if in real life you never hear again from the cute flirtatious guy who served you coffee in Starbucks, does not mean that in fiction it is forgivable. In fiction, you have certain responsibilities to your reader that you need to fulfill. One of them is following through with characters you introduce. If you name them, you claim them. There's a line that I was told once in explanation to why things in real life do not always work in fiction, \\"An writer's job is always more difficult than God's.\\" What works in real life, has to be explained in fiction. You can't just go striking a person every few weeks by freak lightning and expect your readers to accept it. And you also can't just say offhandedly that main character's died safely out of sight and expect your readers to believe it.<br /><br />The instant Katniss is in the arena, she switches into survivor mode. Without hesitation, she goes back into the cold blooded killer of the first book. She doesn't even take a second to digest what happened to Cinna. She assures herself that now is not the time. Though I agreed with her, I didn't buy her attitude. I expected a few minutes of hesitation, tears, maybe even the beginnings of a break. Her best friend was just brained before her eyes. Even if she was about to be thrown into an arena to fight to the death, can she really just turn off emotions that quickly? By the third book, this doesn't seem the case. As she spends months in a practically catatonic state after her district is destroyed, when the rebels cry for her help. Then would be a good time to switch off her feelings too. But she decides she isn't ready and sulks for a good quarter of the book... But again, this is the second book. I must reign myself back from tearing up the third book just yet.<br /><br />And the former champions don't hesitate either. Even though they were united only hours before, they don't waste a single second in starting the blood fest. Katniss even thinks, `What did I think the handholding would last?' and I think, `Yes. It should have. Just a little bit please.' Now I'm not saying they all needed to throw down their weapons and refuse to fight. That would have been ideal. However if I wrote the story, I would have started with that. Especially with Katniss in her emotional fragility. They all hesitate. They simply refuse to move. Then the Capitol could step in and make things difficult, and have the games forced upon them. Even just a little hesitation would have been nice. Where they try to size up the other tributes and see whether or not they really were as united as they thought they were.<br /><br />But no, instead we jump right into the same scenario as the last book. Which is severely disappointing. That was a missed opportunity right there, Collins. Flew right by you, didn't it?<br /><br />For this part of the book, just go see Hunger Games Book 1. It's much of the same thing all over again. Except this time it's men and women dying not just poor defenseless children. Once again I must beg the question, why are these older men and women not seriously considering throwing down their weapons and refusing to fight? Later you find they had a secret agenda, or at least some of them did, but I have an even bigger problem with that secret agenda and I'll get to that in a moment.<br /><br />We get introduced to the force field again via flamb&eacute;ed Peeta. Pay attentions, kiddies! The force fields are important! Did you get that yet? And then we are treated to pages upon pages of Peeta and Katniss romance. It seems like Katniss has completely given up on Gale simply because he's not present at the moment. Attendance, Gale's Achilles' heel!<br /><br />Not only is this romance seemingly extremely decadent on the part of Katniss, but it gets a little painful in places. Katniss seems to be inflicted with a severe case of the Florence Nightingale effect, where she's only interested in a guy if he's bleeding, battered, or suffering from a near death experience. It's not just Gale that she's behaved this way towards. The only reason Peeta's received more attention is because he just happens to be in more near death situations than Gale has opportunity for.<br /><br />It's really disgusting if you think about it. No wonder she chooses Peeta, at the end of the book- he became clinically insane.<br /><br />The ending of Catching Fire climaxes upon a big reveal. Everyone was playing along so as to get the precious \\"mockingjay\\" to safety. Even the fellow tributes were sacrificing themselves for the better of the cause. They blow up the force field. And then the calvary comes to the rescue... to rescue the wrong people. Why they didn't just leave Katniss and rescue Peeta boggles my mind. For something they had planned so far in advance for, they were remarkably unorganized. Peeta should have been secured immediately as he was the best asset to their cause. And Katniss should have been left to die as a martyr. As cruel as that is, its the smartest course of action that the rebels could have taken. But even though it would have made more sense it would have messed up the direction of Collin's story so she couldn't have that happen. Katniss didn't have to die. She could have been held hostage much like Peeta had been. And we could have had two narrators for the last book... but unfortunately Collins had no foresight. And she dragged her story into the third book where she'd mercilessly shot it to death... WITH BEEEEEEEES! as my brother in law would so eloquently put it.<br /><br />By a writer's standpoint the ending of Catching Fire was rushed. In fact most of the time I was confused at what was happening. In a matter of pages we went from Katniss being attacked, to explosions, to Katniss thinking she had been captured and opting to kill Peeta out of mercy's sake (little late), to Katniss discovering that District 13 exists, to Katniss going psycho bitch on Haymitch's face. It was one huge revelation after another. I could kin it to \\"The Room\\" with the mother randomly announcing her real estate problems, relationship issues and having breast cancer all in one scene. I was severely tempted to throw spoons at this book as well. Though not as much as I wished to stake a spoon through the heart of the last book.<br /><br />When I had finally flipped the book closed at last, I felt disoriented by the wave of revelations made in the final few pages. It was a lot to take in. And Katniss' outburst was like a slap in the face. She obviously understood something in Haymitch's actions that I didn't. Had I been Katniss, I would have simply stood there numbly- trying to take it all in. But Katniss becomes the final explosion as she tries to claw a few more holes in Haymitch's face. For a girl who seemed to understand Haymitch's lies, even adding a few of her own to the batch, so as to pull the wool over Peeta's eyes-- surely overreacted once the tables were turned.<br /><br />In conclusion, I have problems with this book. But this book is clearly the lesser of the evils in the saga. Just wait until I start to dig into Mockingjay.lained in fiction.

B004GYY714|5.0|Great to have world radio all in one simple powerful app. Simple to set up, simple to use, I like simple! Free makes it even better. A must have app.
B003UBTX7C|4.0|True to Baldacci you have no idea what is going on until the end. One thing though...seems to revisit the same area of action in another book.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|Pretty fun, the 3d fruit models are realistic enough. A fat toke plus your own ninja sound effects definitely complete the experience too. Become the fruitiest ninja that ever lived! Hyah!
B002RVZV9U|5.0|My husband and i saw this movie in theaters, and it instantly became a favorite.  I sat around waiting for it to come out on DVD, just in time for Christmas.  I was never a huge U2 fan (like my husband), but i have always loved Led Zeppelin and Jack White (in all of his bands).  Even if i weren't familiar with all of these guitar players, i think i would have loved this film.  The stories these three tell could relate to artists of any form.  (I'm a ballet dancer, and much of what was said in the movie was very inspiring to me as a dancer.)  This movie made for some great conversations over the holidays between me and my other family members from various generations and with diverse musical tastes.  A requirement for any artist, or anyone who loves good music.
B00475AYJQ|4.0|I love the way this author writes, I find myself blissfully sinking into his world with his wonderfully descriptive prose.  Like his first book I couldn't put it down.  Hurry up and write the next one!
0634022296|5.0|I bought this chord songbook for my teenage brother, who loves the Beatles' music, and has been studying the guitar for several years.  After trying to pick out Beatles tunes on his own, he was really pleased with this book.  He said his guitar instructor loves it, too, and has been incorporating the book into lessons.  Even my dad, who hadn't picked up a guitar for many years, was drawn back into playing when i gave my brother the book at Christmas.  It's not usual to be able to please three people with one gift, so i'm very pleased with the choice!  I personally don't know too much about the Beatles, so i wasn't sure if this particular book would be the best choice, but it's so large and has so many songs, that even if it's not 100% comprehensive, it definitely has enough to keep my brother busy for a couple years!
B004RJMUJO|5.0|Great, sharp graphics. Was afraid my Evo 4G couldn't handle it, but was happily proved wrong. Gameplay is repetitive, but is still great fun when you're bored.
B003ZDZ1WG|5.0|Very talented trio.  Kim has a very versatile voice and could sing anything!  So glad she chose to go Country!  I have listened to this cd many times over and it never gets old!  Looking forward to their next compilation!

B000002L73|5.0|My previous room-mates took off with the better of my music collection, so i decided, (while intoxicated) to restock my depleted Ramones selection. The next day, when I received notification of my purchase, i was a bit afraid for the item i may have chosen. Upon, arrival, i was happy to see the familiar back-lit silhouette album cover, and delighted to hear the clear, crisp punk-bop blaring out of my (busted) speakers. This item was in perfect condition, and sounded awesome. One of the better surprises i've given myself.
B004EC5IUW|5.0|Say what you want about these movies but it's hard to deny that they both offer a uniquely beautiful experience. I like to watch it in japanese with subtitles so it can be hard to keep up with the fast paced dialogue, but the concepts in this movie are highly sophisticated and the character development is well done.  Not to mention that this is probably the most powerful visual experience i've ever had.
0316067938|4.0|I read this a few months back but never got around to reviewing it. I absolutely loved it! One of my favorite parts is at the end of Jacob's book. I wasn't expecting what happened at all. It was VERY exciting. I also loved the differences Bella noticed after.... you know. Anyway, I think that's how it will be for us too, after you know... Everything will be MORE and I will read this series again some day. Okay, some parts are uneven but on the whole it's mostly great.
B002LFPAUC|1.0|I'm a big Fawlty Towers fan but this remastered edition begins with a BBC bigmouth telling you how great the BBC and English humor are, and you can't get to the shows you paid for without listening to this boor first.  Every time you turn it on.  Five minutes.  I paid for the damn thing, why do I have to endure this drek?  Drop dead BBC.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|I love watching Castle and couldn't wait to get it on DVD so I could watch it whenever I wanted too.
B0001HAISG|5.0|I loved the kids in this version, very cute and such good actors. The characters are less dark than some versions I've seen, which I think is better for children viewers.  The film made me smile and even laugh out loud, and at times it brought tears to my eyes too.
B0041KKYBA|2.0|I was very disappointed this movie did not go over the whole story, mainly the big role of GSEs (Government Sponsored Entities) Fannie and Freddie had in this disaster.  The fact that they became insolvent and are now on the Feds balance sheet should show they are part of the problem.  The creator is obviously a democrat and I can only dream of a full documentary with a full and unbiased view of the whole situation and let the audience decide who is at fault.  If that was the case, more people would enjoy the movie and everyone in the world would be talking about and debating the movie.  Instead it clearly covers 2 dimensions of the problem in the Fed, and Wall St, and completely misses the 3rd in government taking risk out of the market and putting on the backs of the taxpayers by guaranteeing the loans via GSEs Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.    Just as Obama missed his one chance, his one window, to take the country in the right direction, this movie missed its chance to resinate with the entire world and its biased view will cost it a good portion of its potential audience.  Governemnt played a huge role in the bubble with very favorable tax deductions, removing risk from the market through Gov (taxpayer) guarantees to create more homeowners, and the Fed keeping rates artificially low for a decade all had huge effects in real estate and these points are not mentioned once in this lopsided documentary.    I paid $1 to rent it from RedBox, if it told the entire view I would have already ordered multiple DVDs on Amazon as my #1 gift in 2011 to educate my family and friends.  Instead I watched it once, I will take the points but wouldn't buy it for anyone and would only recommend it to economic savvy people that understand a part of the story is missing from the movie.
B004DK5CW4|5.0|I first rented the movie, and then purchased it. After watching it for the first time, I immediately purchased the movie. The story is very inspirational and the races had me on the edge of my seat until the end. The movie was also humorous, which was an added bonus. The acting is great, and has a strong female lead by Diane Lane. This movie is great for the family and any horse person. I watch this movie over and over, and never get tired of watching it. The movie is easily one of my all-time favorites, and I highly recommend it.
B004NELBPC|5.0|I have been using this app for several month on my M860 and also the Google Chrome Huffington app as well. The content is fair IMO. Tjey have many great journalists as well.

B0021L8V1Q|4.0|The sequel to Iron Man promised to be an entirely different movie because it took the standard trope - playboy superhero trying to lead a double life - and turned it on its ear by having Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) revealing his secret identity to the world. Iron Man is the Batman of the Marvel universe, so you can imagine the implications of a billionaire with an arsenal of firepower at his fingertips.  The government, for one, is extremely nervous about a private enterprise waging wars in foreign countries - a topical concern in today's world of \\"security firms\\" operating in America's wars. Shareholders, for another, fret that the often intoxicated Stark is such a warped genius that he will self-destruct ala Charlie Sheen.<br /><br />Iron Man 2 is further complicated by aggrieved Russian scientist Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) codenamed Whiplash, who teams up with Steve Jobs-like Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell), a second stringer defense contractor.  To make matters worse, Stark's palladium core - the miniature reactor in his chest - is poisoning him.  The world has it out for Mr. Stark.<br /><br />There are several plot points that Iron Man 2 struggles to juggle simultaneously: the leadership of Stark Industries, the government's demands for the Iron Man plans, Stark's romance with his personal assistant Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), his past relationship with his deceased father (a genius in the Walt Disney mold who built his own World's Fair-like Stark Expo), his looming death, his battle with alcoholism, and his rivalry with a competitor (Hammer) and the son of the original developer of a similar suit (Vanko).  And oh yeah, there's a little matter of the Avengers trying Stark out for membership.<br /><br />There's so much going on that inevitably some of these plot points suffer.  Stark's romance with Potts is more implied than acted, his alcoholism is played up for laughs, and both villains are poorly realized in comparison to the other people in Starks' orbit.  Rockwell, in particular, comes off as an incompetent boob incapable of actually leading a company much less rivaling Stark. Vanko, on the other hand, has such a dangerous presence that it's hard to believe he's both a brilliant scientist AND a bird-loving, whip-wielding thug.<br /><br />When Iron Man does bust loose though, it rocks.  War Machine is a welcome sight, and the conflict between Stark and Vanko in the middle of the Circuit de Monaco is thrilling. The fight scenes are exciting, more akin to jet fighters in flight than human-sized tanks.<br /><br />Iron Man 2 doesn't have the emotional heft of its predecessor - it's far too busy to worry about peoples' feelings - but it does pack a solid punch.cular, comes off as an incompetent boob incapable of actually leading a company much less rivaling Stark.

B000000OF6|5.0|my grandson who is 5 loves queen. his daddy grew up listening to queen (plus he is a musician) and he still does so he introduced his son to them.i first bought the videos of queen but had to send it back due to adult material. my grandson puts it in his little cd player, dances and sings along to the songs while he is pretending to be onstage. he just loves it! if you love queen and want a cd with the greatest hits on it..this is the one for you. i am very happy with this purchase.
B003EYVXXW|4.0|AGORA is a strange film one that attempts to explore the history of changing philosophies in Egypt during Roman occupation while attempting to present a biography of the great Egyptian astronomer Hypatia, probably one of the first great women of science.  It succeeds on spectacle but stumbles a bit on chronology and script.  Written by Mateo Gil and Writer/Director Chilean born Alejandro Amen&aacute;bar (honored for 'the Sea Inside' with Javier Bardem, 'The Others', 'Open Your Eyes', etc), and populated with a handsome and smart cast, the film succeed on many levels and frustrates on others.<br /><br />Set in Alexandria, Egypt in the year 391AD, Hypatia (Rachel Weisz) teaches her students in philosophy, mathematics and astronomy: her rapt students include Orestes (Oscar David), Theon (Rupert Evans) and Hypatia's loyal and adoring slave Davus (Max Minghella).  Alexandria is in the throes of upheaval as the ancient culture becomes challenged by Christians who gradually gain influence and power in the city, eventually leading to hostilities with the Jews and with women who are not Christians.  By the end of the film Hypatia has remained a scientist and philosopher, concerned about the movement of the planets and the need for unifying all men in a universal brotherhood and is uninfluenced by the current religions and is condemned to being stoned to death, but an act of real love prevents the agony of the end of Hypatia: her benevolent freeing of her slave, the loving Davus, provides an ending that is bearable.<br /><br />The sets and costumes are dramatically beautiful and the moments when the film concentrates on individual character development instead of focusing on fights and brawls it is quite successful.  The long film simply sinks under its own weight despite the radiant Rachel Weisz' performance as the brilliant and enlightened philosopher and astronomer.  Grady Harp, April 11
B000CSUYKG|5.0|Not only is this Blondie's best album but it is also one of the best ever punk rock albums of all time.  Every single track is excellent and you wouldn't be laughed at if you just re-labeled this \\"Best of\\" or \\"Greatest\\" hits because this album is just that good.  Every track could have been a hit single and for fans and collectors of this mini-lp replica sleeve (mlps) version of this remarkable album you will not be too disappointed.  As far as mlps designs go, this isn't the best I've ever seen but it isn't the worst either and so I'd give it a 3 out of 5 for that measure.  The sound quality of this remastered cd though is very, very good.  Also included is a foldout containing all the lyrics in both English and Japanese.  Even the bonus tracks are great here with an outtake of \\"Heart of Glass\\" and live versions of \\"Bang A Gong\\" the T-Rex cover, \\"I Know But I Don't Know\\" and \\"Hanging On the Telephone.\\"<br /><br />Before drugs, ego and petty jealousies finally afflicted them Blondie was able to churn out this excellent album that deserves a place in any decent sonic library.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B004LROMSO|4.0|Sturdy as the tale of Camelot is and despite both cinematic versions as well as the now famous musical based on the story, television has now taken on the tale and the results as seen by a solitary episode appear to be entertaining as well as a darker and more earthbound version of the dream kingdom of Camelot.  As is usually the case with miniseries the writers vary from episode to episode (Michael Hirst, Thomas Malory, Louise Fox, Steve Lightfoot and Chris Chibnall) as well as the directors (Mikael Salomon, Ciaran Donnelly, Jeremy Podeswa, and Stefan Schwartz), but the cast remains the same and the overall feeling of the series is one that is seductively dark and has a real sense of a mixture of history and legend.<br /><br />So far we have met King Uther as he dies passing on the crown to the King's unknown son Arthur (Jamie Campbell Bower), heretofore known as a commoner.  Arthur's half sister Morgan (a sinister and beautiful Eva Green) is put in place as Arthur's nemesis, Arthur's journey to kingship is nurtured by Merlin (Joseph Fiennes), and weaving in and out of the opening episode are Queen Igraine (Claire Forlani) and the glowing Guinevere (Tamsin Egerton). Thus far the story is focused on a tough battle ahead for the charming young Arthur against the evil vixen Morgan.  It seems to be developing well, but time will reveal whether it will be a worthy successor to the many other versions of the story.  So far it is worth watching: the setting is gorgeous!

B000PWQOAI|4.0|This mini-lp replica sleeve (mlps) version of Ozzy's second solo effort after being kicked out of Black Sabbath for drug-related issues is a real treat for fans and a little less so for collectors.  The mlps design isn't among the best I've seen out there but at least it's not the worst while the remastered sound quality is very good.  Also included is a foldout containing all the lyrics in both English and Japanese.  I don't have the older versions and so I can't tell if this is the infamous overdubbed version and for the record I think it is despicable to try to get out of paying royalties by overdubbing band member parts though I suspect that this is indeed an overdubbed version.  As a guitarist, I'm really only interested in Randy's playing which is still what you get here and so I'm not going to complain too much about the album's content.<br /><br />Randy's playing is inspired and you can clearly hear how much his playing influenced countless others like Malmsteen et al.  The clarity and the speed at which he executes incredible scales and licks is a testament to his brilliant technique and I can only wonder at and dream of ever coming close to imitating what he does on the guitar.  Many guitarists can play fast but very few can play so cleanly, tastefully and correctly at such speeds.<br /><br />For all rock guitarists, this album and \\"Blizzard of Oz\\" are essential listening and both are must-haves in any metalhead's sonic library.
B004KD5TQI|5.0|I haven't heard anything this good since Bjork's Selma Songs and The Twilight saga soundtracks. The Sorority Row soundtrack was close but had some stinkers on it. But this is a masterpiece, I can listen too this all the way through without skipping. The songs are well crafted and extremely unique. I would sum this up to say this is a psychedelic trip hop experience. I hope this sets the blueprint for other soundtracks in the future instead of these generic rock compilations. I get so tired of hearing those, too me they don't set any kind of tone for a film. I saw this film at the theater and just kept focusing on the music. That's when you know you have a great soundtrack. For those that don't know Army of Me is on Bjork's Post album which is a masterpiece in itself. This soundtrack blends together like a landscape a collage of greatness and Art a milestone in the OST's at best !
B004MC8CA2|1.0|this is the first and only app that has ever wanted to know what my accounts are. went to install and it wanted access to retrieve all accounts.  i think not!!!!!!
B0049P1VHS|5.0|When I first heard of this I said to myself, \\"Okay yea another zombie gore fest.\\" But this show is so much more than that. It actually has GOOD acting even though there aren't many actors that you'll recognize. There's drama, romance, a bit of dark comedy and of course plenty of THRILLING horror. This is one of those shows that once you buy the box set you'll say, \\"One more episode.\\" Then realize at 3 in the morning that you can't turn it off. The zombies look amazing and they do an excellent job of portraying a post apocalyptic world. I highly recommend this series. You won't regret it!!!
0670022411|2.0|The book has promise but the plot and writing are very uneven. Reads more like a novice writer's first draft. Not sure whether I will read the sequels...
B000003RCY|5.0|Rammstein......if you're a head banger you must get all of Rammstein's albums. Especially Herzeleid. Der Meister is tha best song ever. Best song to drive to n summer when u on the high way racing someone.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|Very addictive and engaging! Somehow its like throwing a ball and yet completely different . My only complaint is the placement of the ad, which is in your face, unsubtle, and unwelcome. The designers choose to interfere worth game play rather than putting it down in the ground. I normally visit ads that interest me, but not in this game.
B002RHGYOA|5.0|The middle book in this series does not disappoint - the story is as strong as ever and is totally 'unputdownable'!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I really liked the style of the way the book was written. I also became highly invested and interested in the characters, I couldn't wait to find out what happened next!
B002RI9ZQ8|5.0|A great start to the trilogy - has you captivated from the very beginning. A  very clever story with likeable and interesting characters. I especially enjoyed the dual story telling. can't wait for the next one!
1600595871|3.0|I am with A customer I love Alisa Golden's books and have most if not all of them. So I was a bit disappointed to see that there was nothing new in this book. It would have been good to see more examples from other book binders as well as Alisas artwork. This is an excellent book binders resource if you don't have the others.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|This movie was well written about a subject that everyone on this planet can understand: how unscrupulous bankers committed the greatest fraud the world has ever seen, and get away with it. The movie makes the case with great clarity that even a blind man would find fault. What should make people mad is that too much money was spread around to allow these individuals to escape prosecution. I hope this movie makes such a case against the Wall Streeters that eventually public pressure will prevail.
B005BZQVF2|5.0|Paul is an escaped alien from Area 51 or somewhere around there. He is hip, foul mouthed, and rude. Paul is picked up by two English SF nerds who are touring the US following Comic Book conventions and visiting &#34;UFO&#34; sites. Eventually they kidnap a born again woman named Ruth.<br /><br />In order to fully appreciate the humor some basic knowledge of Star Trek, 2001, ET, Starman, X-files, Alien, and Close Encounters is required. My first laugh out loud moment came when they stopped at a gas station. As the two Brits were heading inside, Paul sticks his head out the window of the RV, bangs the side and yells, &#34;Don't forget my Reese's Pieces!&#34;<br /><br />A must see for any Sci-Fi fan.<br /><br />Foul language and sacrilegious. No nudity.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I have loved Angry Birds for a while and this is a perfect addition. Graphics are great and runs smoothly! I would recommend to all!

B00377V6J2|5.0|I had the great fourtune of seeing stevie twice while he was still playing live.In fact i saw his second to last show at alpine valley.He was by far my favorite blues guitar player.This recording is a treasure!I always felt conected with stevie on a soulful level! His passing was so devestating to me it was like losing a family member! When i read the Rolling Stone magazine just after his death i could not stop from crying.Stevie will 4-ever be close to my heart!Hearing this cd is a gift because i always knew that Albert was a big influence 2 stevie but i had no idea how strong this was until i heard this recording and the interaction between them.THE BLUES JUST DOSE NOT GET ANY BETTER THAN THIS!!!!!
B004L49K20|5.0|Great album.  The songs do have a \\"back to their roots\\" as other reviews have mentioned.  I enjoy this CD so much.  Can't stop listening to it.  It's great to have the DVD. The on this DVD the members of Duran Duran explain how they came up with the lyrics and the sound for all of the songs. Plus it has the video for \\"All You Need Is Now.\\"  If you are a Duran Duran fan, this Deluxe Edition is a must have.
B004FN7ZOC|4.0|I have been with this band ever since 'Vs. The World' and i can truly say that Amon Amarth are simply a great band. i wasn't too impressed with 'TOTTG' but they are back and to me this album is a true follow up to the bands 2006 'WOOOS' (lol)<br /><br />The crushing guitars are back and full of melodies and the drums are dangerously thunderous that i find myself 'air drumming' haha. I have tons of respect for Amon Amarth and the music that they display with loads of passion! Johans vocals are as amazing as they have always been.<br /><br />This is a band that is full of energy and it shows on this album. I recommend Amon Amarth for fans of Death Metal and for anyone who is into good metal music!
B003L77GGK|5.0|I am from New Zealand and we are only just watching season 5 on TV at the moment. I brought seasons 1-4 here in New Zealand and got season 5 sent form Amazon, I have pre-ordered season 6 but does anyone know when the release date is for season 6 on dvd is??? I am dying to see it!!!    I love supernatural it is a awesome show the brothers along with Bobby make the show just that much more awesome they are great characters they even add a element of comedy to it :) well done the supernatural team!!!
B000SC245E|5.0|Factory replacement made the printer perform like new. Amazon provided a good price and fast delivery. What more can you ask for?
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I loved True Blood from the first episode, and this DVD set was like a cool breeze on a hot day. It's filled with all sorts of extra features and brilliant commentary. I highly recommend this show and this DVD set to anyone with or without a pulse.
B000UZ4VC8|2.0|This review is 100% about the quality of the vinyl records (2 x 12-in 33.33 rpm 180g., sealed, new). I don't enjoy tics and pops on a new record but after 50 years of it I have abandoned any hope of vinyl perfection. However, I do not expect to pay $25 for one album and find it has a 1950's stereotypical \\"broken record\\" cartoon backtrack: a stuck record literally. As near as I can tell from many (too many)audiophile pressings there is no percentage in buying audiophile pressings: they cost twice as much but have the most serious quality problems at the same or higher frequency. Perfect flatness and reduced inner-groove distortion are nice, but they hardly matter if there are loud pops and tics and a backtrack.     I wish Knopfler had stuck with SACDs but respect his persisting with vinyl. The CD enclosed with the album is OK for a CD. The recording quality of the record is good to very good but not another Love Over Gold by any means. The pressing quality lowers the rating a lot. In between tie tics, pops, and skips, the surfaces are very quiet, except where they aren't.     As with any vinyl record, only buy from a dealer who will exchange it 100% of the time without a fee, and be prepared to return one out of five.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Really works and I can feel myself getting stronger each day that I use it.  I am up to level 2, working towards level three!!
630503723X|4.0|I saw this film in the theater when it was first released and have never forgotten it. Now, with Amazon, I was able to find it and purchase it.    The film is exactly as I remember. Extremely well produced and just beautiful. I recommend watching it in French with English subtitles. The French language just makes it even lovelier.    A couple with an open marriage enjoy different experiences, both together and separately. The camera angles are just right. There is nothing graphic in this film which leaves alot to your imagination. That makes viewing the film even better.
B002ZG976U|5.0|I picked up this movie because I'm a huge Cher fan.  I am now a huge fan of Christina's as well.  This is a great modern day musical that seamlessly blends music into storyline.
B004LRZ2YC|5.0|Wife liked it and I loved it!  I'm not that into vampire movies unless you count Lost Boys and Day Walkers. This bad boy was better than both. Great attention to detail and doesn't leave you hanging...

B0034G4P7G|3.0|I had received the magic red and white envelope in the mail a few days ago.<br /><br />The red and white envelope held a ticket that would allow me to go to places I had never been before. I had indulged for a low monthly rate of unlimited transportation to magical kingdoms; time travel to the Wild West; the opportunity to wine and dine with kings and queens and sleep in alleys and dine on pork and beans. There are some trips that I wish I had never taken and this was one of them.<br /><br />The trip was back to 2004 to Cambridge, Mass., to hang out at Harvard University with Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook. The red and white envelope held the movie, \\"The Social Network,\\" sent to me by Netflix.<br /><br />I had wanted to see the movie for a while and I finally got to this past Saturday. The movie was well-written and the actors did great jobs in their portrayals, particularly if everyone in there were jerks, especially Zuckerberg.<br /><br />In a minor role in the movie, Brenda Song does a great job portraying the girlfriend of Facebook co-founder, Eduardo Saverin, played by Andrew Garfield. In a fit of jealous rage, Song puts a wastebasket on Saverin's bed and sets a scarf that he bought her ablaze.<br /><br />The only likable character in the movie is Saverin. Garfield evokes our sympathy for Saverin and makes us despise Zuckerberg. In one of the movie's scenes, Saverin is suing Zuckerberg when Zuckerberg's lawyer asks Saverin about charges of animal cruelty. It seems that Saverin had been accused of animal cruelty during an initiation into an exclusive club. Saverin had to carry a chicken with him everywhere he went and he is at a dinner party, where chicken is being served, so he gives the chicken tiny bits of chicken to eat. This causes him to be accused of forcing cannibalism on the chicken. The animal rights groups are in an uproar at Saverin.<br /><br />In the late 80s and early 90s, I worked at a hatchery owned by the Cherry family in Lee, Fla. The egg shells, discarded (read \\"dead\\") chicks and yolks would be sent to the feed mill over in Live Oak to be made into chicken feed, so I guess that would be forcing chickens to be cannibals also.<br /><br />The least likeable character in The Social Network is Zuckerberg. Portrayed by Jesse Eisenberg, the Facebook co-founder has no redeeming values.<br /><br />In the end, the whole movie seemed more or less a hatchet job on Zuckerberg. I don't know the true story of what really happened in the formation of Facebook and I probably never will. Internet sources are full of contradicting statements. In the end, I guess that Zuckerberg is laughing all the way to the bank.<br /><br />I will not be taking a return trip to The Social Network via my Netflix ticket. I may have rented the movie, but it's definitely not worth owning.<br /><br />Only because of the fine writing and great acting, I'm giving the movie three of five stars.s and yolks would be sent to the feed mill over in Live Oak to be made into chicken feed, so I guess that would be forcing chickens to be cannibals also.

B004KSQN7C|5.0|Incredible. Femme Fatale is delicious. There is just something about Britney that brings the wild side out of me. This album is off the hook. \\"How I Roll\\" is infectious and \\"Gasoline\\" is strange and intriguing. Congrats Brit, best album of your lovely career.
B00004S6GL|5.0|Elliott Smith exposed every part of himself through his music. He encompassed his life, even its most mangled aspects, in their entirety through song. The result was not the most easily perceived music, or even the most liked. It was beauty that wasn't obvious and thrown in your face; it's not immediately understood but it's deserving of the time it takes to divulge its meaning. The pain in the music is strikingly evident as it's part of his identity. But this is not to be critiqued.  Smith suffered the most horrible varieties of abuses, but channeled them into greatness. Elliott Smith was infinitely able contort even the most hideous hardships into accessible, admirable work. The result was universally relatable, raw emotion that could be interpreted as anyone wished. Because he didn't bitch and moan like James Blunt or make his cause blatantly obvious. He just lived for his music, and you can feel it when you listen to him.    Elliott Smith found idiosyncratic ways to make people feel. Whatever his music might evoke, it takes some self-interpretation to get there, making it more worthwhile. On Figure 8, you can't sit through \\"Wouldn't Mama Be Proud\\" and not be moved by the time he says \\"If I send you postcards from the side of the road/Photographs of moving parts about to implode/If I crawl to keep it together like you say you know I can do/To transmit the moment from me to you\\", if you truly are listening. It's beautiful and original, a rarity in modern music. Even his most simple songs like \\"Can't Make a Sound\\" are so expressive through the instrumentals alone that they resonate. And then there are the really abstract ones like \\"Son of Sam\\" that are catchy and make you think even if you have no idea what Elliott's talking about.      The one that sticks the most is \\"Happiness\\". With its simple lyrics, it's somehow tragically beautiful considering the circumstances. Looking back on it after his suicide, the lyrics \\"What I used to be will pass away and then you'llsee\\" are pretty haunting and saddening, but even extracted from the situation it's just another brilliant song. And it's disheartening to think that someone who could so inspirationally master the guitar, piano, drums, vocals, and even harmonica couldn't save himself from addiction and self-loathing in time. But perhaps it's that deep of a level of feeling that he was at, though disturbing, that it took to formulate such brilliant music. Two stabs to his own chest on October 21, 2003 and Elliott Smith was gone, but his music never will be.
1591843790|5.0|How much do I love this book? I got a review copy and started reading it at the airport waiting for a flight to see a client. Tore through the first 50 pages right away. On the way back home, I left it either in the airport or on the plane. After searching frantically without finding it, I did three things: 1) Resolved to get another copy as quickly as possible, 2) went out to buy an iPad just so I could download Enchantment and 3) Offered up a sincere hope that whoever found the book would get a fraction of what I got out of just the beginning. I'm just finishing reading it now.    If you are looking for a list of tips on how to close that next sale without any kind of \\"life\\" context then there are dozens, maybe hundreds, of books you can buy. Ditto if you are looking for \\"sales techniques.\\" While taking the advice and core message of Enchantment to heart will very definitely help you sell more of whatever it is you make or whatever service you offer it is not a quick fix. Being able to do what Guy is talking about in Enchantment requires a change in the way that many business people--especially sales people--think and look at the world and their place in it.    Being able to enchant is a way of life, a way of thinking, a way of viewing yourself and others. It is about taking a sincere interest in the needs and desires of others. It is about really caring. Faking it to make the sale is not enough.     The changes taking place around the world point to something much bigger than a mere cyclical change in the economy. We are in the midst of a fundamental \\"reboot\\" in everything from politics to science to spiritual thinking to business. Those who can succeed will not be the ones who put on a coat of phony charm to disguise their lack of interest in anyone's welfare and success but their own. Those who really make it will be the ones who know and practice the ideas presented in Enchantment in every facet of their lives.    When you get right down to it, Enchantment isnot really a business book although many will look at it as such. It is a LIFE book. Enchantment is not a craft that can be learned with a few written instructions and some clever improv. It is an ART that has to come from a deeper place than your wallet.    On my bookshelf, Enchantment is not stacked with the \\"how-to\\" business and management books. It sits comfortably among the other life-changing titles that have a place of special honor--The Art of War, The Cluetrain Manifesto and The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success. Not only will I re-read it many times, it is now mandatory reading for anyone working with me. Read Enchantment. Be open to changing the way you look at yourself and the world. Practice--really practice--the ideas within its pages. Do this and i promise that Enchantment will change your life.
B003YFIUW8|1.0|I had pretty high expectations for this book because of all the positive reviews.  I found the first part of the book pretty boring - I understand the author wanted to help the reader understand how days in the room were spent but they seem to go on FOREVER.  This is the first book I wished I had not gotten on my Kindle because I wanted to skip ahead just to find out what happens and stop reading the book.  I was just impatient with the pace of the book.  I then got frustrated with what happens once they get out of the room.  I finally just gave up and stopped reading it.  I would not recommend this book and should have spent more time reading the reviews before purchasing it.
B004FRX0MY|4.0|Great player and the cloud player feature is great. What a great invention, found some great deals on music, highly recommended for those that require portability with their music.
B00338QENI|5.0|I am so glad that I took a chance and purchased this book for my Kindle.  The author brilliantly weaves the story of Henrietta Lacks as a person with the scientific aspects of her cancerous cells.  I appreciated the family's perspective - how no one took the time to adequately explain what part of Henrietta was still alive and what it actually meant to world.  I was also fascinated by the story of Henrietta's eldest daughter - sweet, beautiful Elsie and her unfortunate life at Crownsville Hospital.  This book truly is a labor of love for author and the family who gave of their time and their memories so that the world could get to know the person behind the HeLa cells.  I highly recommend this book.
B004SBS8LA|3.0|Like everyone else I am A Huge Angry Birds fan and love the new version Rio, but after playing it and completing all the levels available the game just stopped loading...so I uninstalled it and will try reinstalling it. Hope it was just a bug and won't happen again cuz it's kinda frustrating!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I was surprised to see so many poor reviews of this final book in the Hunger Games trilogy.  The only thing I didn't like about it was that it signaled the end to the saga.  I would no longer be able to read about Katniss, Peta, Haymitch and the rest from District 12.  I thought the book ended perfectly - not too sappy and with everything addressed.  The fact that a life as traumatic as Kat's would have long-lasting consequences is illustrated throughout this final book.  I really appreciate the final chapter that let us glimpse Kat's life years later.  I try not to say too much about the story in my reviews but I was constantly surprised by Kat's action including a very surprising thing she does after the President is captured.  Those kinds of twists are what make a book memorable and worth reading.  I was very satisfied with Mockingjay and recommend it.
B00428CPUY|5.0|Love this DVD. Great to sit & watch or just have playing in background while doing stuff around the house.
0439023521|5.0|I originally got this book on my Kindle because of the low price and high ratings. I am so happy I did.  After initially getting to know Katniss and the other characters I was literally swept away with this trilogy.  I actually \\"miss\\" them now that I am finished with all three books.  I enjoy the character development involved with initially disliking a character and then later coming to appreciate them...Haymitch is an example in these books.  The books are written in a way that this world and the games are easy to visualize.  I'm a little nervous about these books becoming a movie - I am very glad that I read them first.  I highly recommend this book along with the whole trilogy!
B003XMUFGQ|5.0|Wonderful variety of music by the master, Eric Clapton. He's an awesome, awesome artist. Great mix of blues, soft rock, jazz. I can relate so many of these songs to my own life experiences.
B0015DROBO|4.0|Although it was difficult for me to \\"get into\\" this book, I'm glad a friend told me to stick with it!  My difficulty was based on not being familiar with the country, names and money so I had to pay more attention to the details.  I prefer to read books that become movies in my mind as I read the pages of the book.  This book (and the two sequels) started to become a movie in my mind about midway through...and OH WHAT A MOVIE.  I love the way the book has several \\"endings\\" and wrapped up all the details.  To me - that is part of the genius in a good book.  I am so sorry Stieg Larsson did not live to experience the success of his trilogy or to write more!
B004KSQN7C|5.0|I heard so many Britney fans saying how this replaced Blackout as their favorite Britney album when it leaked, but I waited for it to actually be released to listen to it. I can honestly say that for me it was DEFINITELY worth the wait. It's up there with Circus (the album that made me a fan) for my favorite, although I'm not sure which one I like more yet though. Anyway...<br /><br />Till The World Ends - the 2nd single on the album, written by Ke$ha (TiK ToK on the clock). I usually don't like Ke$ha (except for maybe Blind and Dancing With Tears In My Eyes) but she did a good job with this track. Will make you want to get up and \\"dance 'till the world ends\\".<br /><br />Hold It Against Me - ah, yes, Britney's 4th #1 hit that broke the original record for most spins in a day (later broken by Lady GaGa). It's basically about Britney asking a boy if he would hold his body against her (in both ways).<br /><br />Inside Out - Britney's trying to break up with this guy, but it's hard to do because he \\"knows her inside out\\". References to her earlier hits ...Baby One More Time and (You Drive Me) Crazy.<br /><br />I Wanna Go - The same subject as Touch Of My Hand from In The Zone. Screams summer hit.<br /><br />How I Roll - Britney talks about \\"going downtown where her posse's at\\" because \\"she got 9 lives like a kitty cat\\". Another really danceable track.<br /><br />(DD) Beautiful - Duet with a new rapper named Sabi. Basically just a song about how hot/beautiful this boy is.<br /><br />Seal It With A Kiss - secret love... ooo... Britney and this boy keep their love a secret \\"and seal it with a kiss... oooh\\".<br /><br />Big Fat Bass - The rumored next single in the U.S. Duet with Will.I.Am (who also writes songs for the Black Eyed Peas). It's about... well, what numbers do treble clefs and bass clefs look like? Yeah, that...<br /><br />Trouble For Me - This guy, he's the life of the party, but Britney's the only one smart enough to stay away from him. However, \\"he's got something she likes, but she might regret it.\\"<br /><br />Trip To Your Heart - The \\"Heaven On Earth\\" (Blackout) and \\"That's Where You Take Me\\" (Britney) of the album. Very sweet and romantic. :)<br /><br />Gasoline - Spark! And it's like gasoline! Basically, it's just her comparing her love for someone to gasoline.<br /><br />The next track, Criminal, is the closest this album comes to a ballad. Britney's confessing to her mom she's in love with a criminal. But this love isn't rational, no, like most songs on this album, it's physical love. My favorite non-single on the album, and I could see it as a winter single.<br /><br />Now onto the bonus tracks:<br /><br />Up N' Down - My favorite of the bonus tracks. It's about Britney going \\"up and down, up and down, up and down\\" on a boy. Do with that what you will.<br /><br />He About To Lose Me - The verses are probably the most raw vocals we've heard of Britney in years. Then the chorus comes and it doesn't sound like her anymore. She's singing how this guy's, well, about to lose her.<br /><br />Selfish - Britney's gonna be a little sailfish ;) tonight, picking that guy up in her Mercedes. Haha. Cute.<br /><br />Don't Keep Me Waiting - Britney's tired of waiting... guess what she's waiting for? That's right, his touch.<br /><br />All in all, a very good album. It's hard for me to stop listening to and like Blackout, there are little to no ballads and all the songs are basically about the same subject. I hope you enjoy it as much as I have. If you don't though, that's okay too. Haha. :)Heaven On Earth\\" (Blackout) and \\"That's Where You Take Me\\" (Britney) of the album. Very sweet and romantic. :)    Gasoline - Spark! And it's like gasoline! Basically, it's just her comparing her love for someone to gasoline.    The next track, Criminal, is the closest this album comes to a ballad.

B0046MOVD0|5.0|Overall, a very entertaining experience for fans of the games and movies.  PQ & AQ are very good, and match the intent of the film maker (personal opinion is that this movie looks much better in 2D).  Recommended.
B004EC5IV6|5.0|I was anticipating this ever since I saw Evangelion 1.01. And when I finally got the chance to watch it, I was blown away. The action hits hard and fast right from the beginning with the epic battle between Mari and the skeletal Third Angel. The rest of the movie bears almost no resemblance to the original series, other than the characters themselves. Mr. Anno has taken his already landmark series and turned it into a true masterwork. I normally watch a movie once, gush over it for a few days to a week and then put it on the shelf. Not only do I still need to get through all of the extras, but I am going to watch it again as soon as I get the chance! The voice acting, while not top-notch was still very well-done, and the animation was beautiful. The climactic battle between Unit-01 and the Tenth Angel had me glued to my seat... it was so spectacular that it demanded all of my attention, so huge and epic that it allowed room for nothing else. There is only one gripe that I have, and it is this: now that I have seen something so good, I have to wait on pins and needles for 3.33.

B001ECQ4AS|5.0|Supernatural is a series that takes unexplained phenomena and family to a whole new level. The characters are well developed and draw you into the story. This season follows the lives of Sam and Dean Winchester through their search for their father who is also in search of something. Through their journey they come across many evil things that need be exterminated and these boys are just the ones to do it. In the end they find their father and meet up with an evil they have longed to meet as long as they could remember... their mothers killer.  The only thing about the season that is hard to stomach is the cliff hanger at the end! All in all a great series and a must see.

0061689246|5.0|DISCLAIMER - I borrowed this book from a friend.  Neither of us knows Mr. Gaiman.<br /><br />I hate Fairies.<br /><br />If a book has the word \\"Fairy\\" any where in its description I tend not to be willing to read it.  God forbid its spelled \\"Faerie\\" or \\"Fae.\\"  That just REEKS of pretentia to me and I want nothing to do with it.  Why do I feel this way?  Well there are a number of reasons most of which probably herald back to the days of dating a certain young man who would take me to role-playing events as \\"dates\\" (yes, you know who you are, you read this blog and I blame you entirely :)).  But really it's because of the number of atrocious books out there on this topic.  It seems near impossible to find a book that isn't either insipid or basically Tolkein FanFic.<br /><br />But Stardust was written by Neil Gaiman.  Neil Gaiman wrote Sandman and Death.  Neil Gaiman: who summed up my adolescence in shockingly accurate and fanciful ways.  Oh if only my Sandman and I had knows we were meant to be brother and sister, so many things would have been easier!  Neil Gaiman is a genius.<br /><br />Stardust proved me wrong on every front.  Gaiman has written a fairytale; a true old fashioned fairytale that has high stakes and lofty moral lessons.  This is a fairytale with Faeries, Gnomes, mysterious parentage, witches and curses.  And I loved every single moment of it.<br /><br />There is not a single passage in Stardust that isn't expertly crafted or beautifully phrased.  Never over the top, the language chosen for this story suits the mood and tone perfectly.  Written in the style of cannon classics it took me a few tries to really get into the story.  I felt like it was smarter than me and I was working far too hard.  When I submitted to the simple story being told and allowed the words to flow over me and the tale wound itself around my heart, I was able to enjoy it.  I was able to enjoy not only the story but the experience of reading it.<br /><br />Stardust is an adult fairytale.  As you know I am constantly on the hunt for real adult books that challenge and stimulate my brain.  I like nothing less than a book that ends by pulling a rabbit out of a hat and calling it a surprise twist or a book that skimps over the necessary details just to cut it's raking to YA.  Stardust does none of this.  While there is sex in the book, it is neither racy nor inappropriate, it is essential to the story and Gaiman thankfully doesn't sacrifice the integrity of his story just to keep it PG.<br /><br />A few years back Stardust was made into a movie which while I enjoyed is not nearly as good as the book.  They changed a number of things, although I'm not sure why; the book as it is is plenty exciting and beautiful.  I highly recommend Stardust even if you have seen the movie.  The stories are the same enough that if you enjoyed the movie you will like this, but different enough it doesn't feel like a retelling.<br /><br />Gaiman has once again shocked me out of my expectations and proven that often I am wrong.  Stardust is a wonderful story and a beautiful piece of literature.  If you are interested in stories or writing or fairies or love or... well, honestly if you have a pulse you should give this book a try.fairytale.

0515141429|4.0|I'd read a couple Jack Reacher books and liked them, so wanted to, for once, read the first one early on in exploring a recurring character.   It's a good book, not the best of the series that I've read.  And Jack does have a somewhat limited repetoire - stranger hitchhikes or walks into town, is accused of some terrible crime, and kicks major butt in the course of correcting the situation.   But worth a read.

And Diana experiences a completely bewildering change from a smart, educated, extremely independent doctor of history to a blithering, fainting, helpless \\"witch\\" who cannot figure out the simplest of spells and needs her man to take care of her every whim. Including running her hot baths and making her tea and sandwiches. GAG. At least the author could have thrown some hot sex in here to distiguish it from Twilight, and make it a little more interesting. Not worth the time to read this, sorry folks, I was disappointed too.

B004G5ZXVQ|4.0|To be a current REM fans means treating each new release as a comparison to the greatness -- or the occasional clunker -- of the past.  There is just no getting around it.    \\"Collapse Into Now\\" deserves to be judged on its own, but having been an REM fan since the mid-`80s, comparisons to the past remain inevitable.  Some of this collection recalls songs of the distant past and some of the recent past. The band continues to evolve, yet it stays true to its core sound -- that is, its two core sounds -- the jangling, acoustic-guitar strumming and plucked notes with relatively clear Stipe-ian vocals and the fuzzed-up electric-guitar-driven sound first heard on Monster.    \\"Collapse Into Now\\" contains a bit of both.  Many songs seemed to have flowed from \\"Accelerate,\\" which I thought was an excellent effort.      \\"Discoverer\\" is a great opener, with a bit of the \\"7 Chinese Brothers\\" guitar sound opening the song then shifting to a driving beat.  \\"All the Best\\" continues the theme, a punching beat.    \\"Uberlin\\" represents a switch back to the acoustic sound; it feels like it could have been found on \\"Automatic for the People.\\"  Peter Buck's trademark acoustic chord strumming combined with the plucking of the B and high E strings.  It really defines how he plays acoustically.  Listen to \\"Down by the Water\\" by the Decemberists and you will really hear what I mean.    I have to complain, though, that  \\"Oh My Heart\\" is way too close a sequel to \\"Houston\\" from Accelerate.  Michael almost re-uses the same line, going from \\"If the storm did not kill me, the government will\\" to \\"the storm didn't kill me, the government changed.\\"  I get the reference here, but something about it really bothered me -- to the extent that I am skipping this song.  Michael is a gifted songwriter, so why recycle your old work?  I know they recorded part of this in New Orleans, so this continues the Katrina theme, but it's too much for me.    I love \\"Alligator_Aviator...\\" but I long for Kate Pierson of the B-52s (as on \\"Shiny Happy People\\") on the female vocal party, though Peaches does her best to imitate the style.  \\"That Someone is You\\" is a perfect follow-up here, with Mike Mills adding great high-end harmonizing in addition to his usual stand-out bass lines.    \\"Me, Marlon Brando...\\" recalls Neil Young's Pocahontas (\\"Marlon Brando, Pocahontas and me\\").  I read that Michael said it is about him asking Neil for advice, though how you get that from the lyrics is beyond me.    \\"Blue\\" closes out the release in an unexpected way.  Michael's stream-of-consciousness lyrics lead the way through a trippy song, backed by Patti Smith's droning vocals  -- very reminiscent of \\"E-bow the Letter\\" on \\"New Adventures in Hi-Fi.\\"  It sounds like a therapy session.  I could have done without the flash back to \\"Disoverer\\" at the end, though.    All in all, well done by one of the best bands of the last 30 years.  Still not their best, but not \\"Around the Sun\\" or \\"Up\\" either.
B001OQCV2E|5.0|this is a fantastic movie, the special effects are unbeleveable.   only one dissappointment. it was a wide screen movie insted of a FULL SCREEN movie, but other than that, i would recomend this movie to any one, especually if they want a glimps of what the end of the earth (12/24/12) is supposed to be like. if what the myian callender predicts is correct, THIS movie portrays it perfectly.     ive watched this movie over and over and STILL cant get over the special effects that went into the making of this movie. its truly astounding.
B004L49K20|4.0|Please forgive me while I wax philosophic, but I thought I would give an honest, yet detailed review of the new album which purports itself to be the next \\"Rio\\"(I cringe to  hear the comparison to \\"Rio\\" because I consider it to be the definitive pop album of the '80's if not all time). To compare this album to \\"Rio\\", it is important to look at the construction of the record. \\"Rio\\" was largely dependent on the sound of the technology that was used to create the recording. This is what made it a cohesive and congruent collection of tunes. First and foremost, I'll start with the keyboard sounds which were central to the early \\"Duran\\" sound. Nick Rhodes used the Roland Jupiter 8 synced to a Roland Compurhythm CR-78 to create the textures to almost all of the songs on the album. The Jupiter's random arpeggiator can be found in almost all of the songs. Rhodes also used the Prophet 5 synthesizer for the sound effects including helicopter and wind type sweeps. For leads, He used a Crumar Performer string synth, often run through a Roland SPH-323 Phase Shifter which gave that unique washing sound. He ran an output of the CR-78 to Roger who used it as a click track. Roger also used the technologically distinct sound of Simmons pads and LinnDrum samples. John used a single-pickup Aria Pro II Super Bass run through an Ampeg SVT tube amp, which if drive, gives a very warm sound. He adds chorus for \\"Lonely In Your Nightmare\\". Andy uses a Les Paul run through a (speculation here) Roland Jazz Chorus amp to give his leads a very \\"synthesized\\" sound. Simon constructed the lyrics to the record much differently to the process he now uses. He called them in an interview \\"Fantastical\\", because he lacked the life experience to write any other way. Actually, Simon was right in line with many other artists at the time who wrote similarly. It was a very poetic time.  So...is AYNIN the new \\"Rio\\"? Nick uses Roland synths (VSYNTH) and arpeggiators with CR-78 samples - Especially in \\"The Man..\\".but not to the extent of \\"Rio\\". John no longer plays the bass aggressively, melodically, in the style of the late Bernard Edwards(well kind of on \\"Girl Panic). Roger holds it down, but the drums are overall less electronic. Ironically, a couple of points remind me of \\"modern English\\" and another couple of Gary Numan. Simon's lyrics are not to the level of \\"Rio\\", but his singing is excellent nevertheless.   \\"Rio\\" it is not, but it is the best they have done in years and I would rate it third behind their first two albums (\\"Rio\\" first of course). Ask yourself two questions: Would you want another \\"Rio\\"? How many chances will \\"Duran\\" have to \\"Come Back\\"?(Wedding Album, Astronaut etc...). With the exception of \\"Medazzaland\\", it is the best work they have put out in almost three decades. I just hope that all Duran needs is \\"now\\".

030745455X|5.0|This has become one of my favorite series of all time. In this 2nd installment, Lisbeth and Blomkvist tackle the sex trade industry. While I loved the first one, this one was much better. I felt I got to know both characters better and could better anticipate their actions and reactions. There is one more left and I am in no hurry to get. I'm dragging it out because I know there is only one more!<br /><br />This is one of those series that you hope never ends.<br /><br />My only warning would be for the faint of heart. This is sometimes almost like noir fiction--very dark and sexual. No cozy thriller, here; only dark thoughts, violent murders and sadistic sex crimes. The main character, Lisbeth, is truly one of the baddest I've ever seen! I would put my money with her battling the Terminator, Blade, Rocky---you name it. Even though it is difficult to connect with her, it is through her view of the world that you come to love her so much. The plot is one of those that just has you scratching your head the whole time--pure genius.<br /><br />I loved every word and plan to read them all again, just for the pleasure of reading Larson's work. Read them--you won't be sorry.
B0034G4OXQ|1.0|I expected something a lot different. The trialer for this movie made it look so important and so enjoyable. Now there a lot of people claiming that most others didn't get it, now let me tell you something, those people are just egotisitc snobs, alright? I understood to an extent, what this movie's message sort of was. Personally, I felt like it had to with a little bit a destiny and peace with what we don't understand. And that message isn't terrible, the movie is. Now some interesting things happen, one guy, one girl, and one british kid all experience death in their lives. The girl was pulled into a tsunami and had a near death experinece, the british kid's twin brother was hit by a car, and the guy, or Matt Damon can talk to ghosts from the other side. Now to tell you the truth, I did expect an Action-Triller or some big important adventure to save the world or whatever, but what you get is three seperate storylines who barely overlap.I understand the importance of the british kid and the girl's storylines, but Matt Damon's lengthy backstory (which is about 97% of his part of the film, what he does before he meets the kid and the girl) was completely unnecessary, and should've definetly shortened. In fact half of the movie towards the end should've been altered, in my opinion. It takes them forever to meet! It's agonyizing when you know they'll eventually meet, but it'll take more than an hour to do so. And I feel like they were leading up to something like how important life is or to not be afraid of death, since the girl had a near death experince you'd figure she'd have some question about the afterlife, and Matt Damon will answer them...but you won't hear anything. Seriously? I thought that was suppose to be the big important thing of the movie, in fact if I'd written it, it would've been, and it would've been revealed a lot eariler. But the real climax of this movie is more realistic and super natural but natural enough for us to relate to it. Now I feel that I might want to give this movie just one more star because some people could relate to it in some vast minority, but since I'm not part of that group, this movie really sucks, it's something you watch once, and I'm not even sure the people that liked it will watch it again, I suggest you stay away from it and look for something worth your timeat I might want to give this movie just one more star because some people could relate to it in some vast minority, but since I'm not part of that group, this movie really sucks, it's something you watch once, and I'm not even sure the people that liked it will watch it again, I suggest you stay away from it and look for something worth your time
B004A8ZX28|3.0|Copy cat in the bag catches copy rat in the camera. Bourne has already done all that in Berlin, Moscow, London, Paris, Hong Kong or Shanghai, and a good twenty more touristic destinations. This one is touched by some nostalgia with a special focus on East Berlin. Friedrichstrasse Bahnhof, the entering station of East Berlin, a little bit of Unter den Linden, next door, and then the Brandenburg Tor on the East side essentially, the East German TV tower on Alexandra Platz, the Hohenzollern Palace' rebuilt after the fall of the wall, and an ex-Stasi agent, and some survivors of the Cold War, terrorist style from the West. We just miss the Karl Marx Allee and the Vopos [Volkspolizei for the younger generation who never met them] of course. I guess East Berlin is cheaper for film makers than West Berlin. Then the whole thing is wrapped up in some kind of nice pieces of ideological good will. The Stasi commits suicide on the screen. The brutal Serbs are killed one by one and one after another. The Arab prince is a nice-looking nearly Caucasian young chap and he is supporting western science. The scientists are developing a new type of maize that will grow in the desert and will kill all insects five hundred miles around and the NGOs are even said (or is it told?) to approve it, and it is true the ecological zombies have been made scarce. The only negative point is that the terrorists are plain criminal hit men paid by the agricultural industry to kill the scientist and steal his files. And all that goes down the chute because of a weirdo professional killer who loses his memory and his mind. Superb! Well, people my age can always get some kicks out of the little bits of East Berlin they remember when the Stasi was everywhere. But I guess that will do for this plagiaristic European TV elite.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU

159420229X|5.0|\\"Moonwalking with Einstein\\", by Joshua Foer (a freelance journalist), places the `spotlight' on the question as to how closely one's `memory' is associated to one's `identity' by recounting the author's experience developing his own power of recall (which, by Foer's own admission was average, at best), and ultimately winning the 2006 U. S. Memory Championship. Throughout his `mnemonics journey' Foer explores the related questions as to whether improving his memory would enable him to become smarter/wiser, more persuasive/attentive/self-confident, and a better journalist/friend/boyfriend.     Foer's adventure starts out with him wondering how the `smartest person in the world' would stack up against the `strongest person in the world'. However, after conducting numerous Google searches Foer discovers that it is much more difficult to quantify `brains' than `brawn'. So Foer `settles' for the person who ostensibly has the `best' memory, a `freakish genius' named Ben Pridmore who is the reigning world memory champion. Foer is inspired by Pridmore's earlier statements in a newspaper that anyone is capable of performing his memory feats by learning and applying the proper `technique' and understanding how memory works. As an observer at the 2005 U. S. Memory Championship Foer meets a young grandmaster named Ed Cooke, as well as other `mental athletes'; all of them reinforce Pridmore's assertion that anyone with proper training could perform the memory feats they do. Accordingly, Foer is inspired to embark on an intense training program (lasting one year) with the goal of competing in the U. S. Memory Championship. Ed Cooke, in effect, becomes Foer's personal `yogi and manager'. Ed explains the importance of memory among the ancient civilizations, and laments the reality that memorization is becoming a lost art; i.e., society's `internal memory' continues to erode as we increasingly depend on `external memory' (e.g., computer, cell phones, paper, books, et al).     Foer learns about a 30-year study done (1928-1958) by A. R. Luria of a man called \\"S\\" who remembered everything to which he was exposed, and whose memory never degraded. As it turns out, \\"S\\" is afflicted with Synthesia wherein a stimulus of one sense (e.g., hearing a sound) is perceived as a sensation of another sense (e.g., seeing a color); this malady actually facilitated his extraordinary memory. Foer states, \\"S could memorize complex mathematical formulas without knowing any math, Italian poetry without speaking Italian, and even phrases of gobbledygook.\\" Luria eventually wrote a book about \\"S\\" titled, \\"The Mind of a Mnemonist: A Little Book About a Vast Memory\\".     Foer meets a group of students from the Samuel Gompers Vocational High School (competing in the 2005 U. S. Memory Championship) and their American history teacher, Raemon Matthews who expresses his firm believe that memory training should be an integral part of the formal educational system. Later, while watching a TV program Foer learns about a 26 year-old British `prodigious savant' named Daniel Tammet who displayed genius in numerous different areas, e.g., complex multiplication and division in his head, identifying prime numbers up to ten thousand, speaking more than six languages, inventing his own language, et al. Foer eventually meets Daniel Tammet. (Foer indicates that two disabilities have conspired to produce Tammet's amazing abilities: synesthesia, and Asperger's syndrome.). Foer also meets Kim Peak (aka Rain Man), the prodigious savant featured in the movie titled, \\"Rain Man\\".  As the antithesis of people with extraordinary memories, Foer meets `EP', a man whose memory is limited to events prior to 1950, plus those events to which he has been exposed during the most recent few minutes; EP virtually lives in the present.      This book is not a cookbook on mneumonic techniques, although it does provide an overview of some techniques, e.g.,   (1) Memory Palace - This technique, which was inventedby Simonides of Ceos, is also known as `journey method', or `method of loci'. It can be used for, e.g., memorizing a shopping list, a string of random digits, prose, poetry, et al.   (2) Major System - This technique, which is less powerful than the Memory Palace, is a simple code whereby numbers are converted into phonetic sounds which, in turn, are converted into images to be used as a memory palace. The Major System approach was invented by Johann Winkelmann.  This book provides a distinction between `natural memory' (which Foer calls \\"the hardware you're born with\\") and `artificial memory' (which Foer calls \\"the software that runs on your hardware).      I found this book to be enlightening and thoroughly engaging. It provides deep insight into the history of the `art of memory' and the close association between one's memory and one's identify. Foer provides strong motivation for developing one's memory via mnemonics training.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|It's true! I have purchased thousands of dollars worth of products from Amazon but have never been inspired to write a review. Until now.     I don't know what Adele's vocal background is (I'll look up her bio eventually) but whatever it may be, it is varied in terms of pronunciation of words and creative use of the staccato (a form of musical articulation, signifying an unconnected note, which is separated or detached from its neighbors by a silence).    \\"Chasing Pavements\\" was her first U.S. chart and my introduction to Adele. Although I was not knocked out of my socks by the song it inspired me to look forward to more. But still have not heard another track from the \\"19\\" album.    But \\"21\\"'s \\"Somebody Like You\\" which I first heard on the VH1 Unplugged she did was a haunting, emotional and (if I may say) downright sexy song. Way too good of a tune to discourage me from believing that Adele had other hits waiting for my discovery. And even if she didn't the price of the album would almost be worth it for just that one song.    But all but maybe 2 or 3 of these songs are really good. Her remake of The Cure's \\"Love Song\\" is decent enough to be on the album but is possibility the weakest of the offerings on \\"21\\".
B004EPYZPI|5.0|\\"The Lincoln Lawyer\\" with more twists and turns than a corkscrew reminded me of those classic L.A. crime thrillers like \\"Chinatown,\\" and the hardboiled school of Dashiell Hammett, Raymond Chandler, and James M. Cain. Mickey Haller is a shrewd lawyer who manipulates the law, but can't stand it when he gets set-up and framed. In this one there are multiple set-ups. It is very cleverly woven together. The acting is serviceable and effective, but not superb. It is filmed very neatly with a fast pace that adds to the suspense. It is partly courtroom histrionics, but much of the action takes place outside the courtroom.<br /> Mickey is played by Matthew McConaughey, and he is well-cast for the part as is Ryan Phillippe, his client who is accused of an assault upon a woman. Mickey is a scammer who even scams the stuffy family attorney with a videotaping scheme.<br /> At the beginning everything happens at a breakneck speed, and it is difficult to hear the rapid conversation. It settles down, and we catch our breath. Phillippe plays spoiled and wealthy Louis Roulet who fervently pleads his innocence. Haller has been dealing with the lower echelons of the accused, and he needs a financial break. He's represented a member of a biker gang, a mob that shows up regularly in the movie and comes in handy. Other unsavory clients and cases have been Haller's stock and trade. He gets chauffered around in a Lincoln limo by a man who owes Mickey money for handling his drug case.<br />Get ready for layers of plot intrigue, ploys and mazes within mazes. Never try to scam a scammer, because he's probably going to catch on. I got pulled into this narrative, and the time flew by.<br />Author Michael Connelly has consistently turned out the best American crime novels of anyone out there. His detective Harry Bosch is legendary. Mickey Haller is a good addition to the Connelly cast. I can see a sequel on the horizon because there are several Haller books in my library.
B00005N5S2|5.0|This movie not only depicts the historical points of WW2, in reference to Gen. McArthur, but includes the emotions of the man, making it a very personal human touch. Outstanding screenwriting and actors make this a \\"movie to own.\\"  I definately recommend this movie to all who love history.

B001P9EQH8|5.0|I bought this amp for my ipod nano and Sennheiser HD555 which are 50ohms. I have all my mp3 pre-amped at 90db which gives the best sound quality out of my ipod with the EQ turned on. Unfortunately, because the mp3s are lower than normal, my 50ohm HD555 was asking for more power. These little bad E5 amps solved that problem. Without distorting the sound, it gave full volume and sound to my cans. The loudness switch on the E5 gave that extra umph for those bass lovers. When connected to my laptop, I have never heard my HD555 sound so good. Thanks to the FiiO E5, I get to appreciate music all over again!!!

B003PIUC02|5.0|Great show with a great production and incredible acting.  I have bought this box set for a couple people now as I have been trying to spread the love I have for this show.  I love period pieces and enjoy the violence the sex and in your face subject matter that is often overlooked in \\"nicer\\" more watered down shows.  It shows sexuality, violence political corruption etc. in a time when there were plenty of abuses in all.  Its a shame about Andy Whitfield and wish there were some way that when he is better that he can reprise his role and reclaim his rightful place as Spartacus.  The prequel was good too in working in the story line and the prospect of seeing the character Gannicus become one of Spartacus's generals.  Go and get it now!
B004G600A4|2.0|Despite the wonderful animation and art direction, this is yet another of Disney's failed attempts to capture the magic of their \\"golden age\\" of the 1990s.  The Lost Princess/Rapunzel is just another \\"misunderstood\\" girl who's coming of age means rebellion against her parent.  This is practically a theme for Disney films of late, perhaps done so they'll be marketable to the so-called spoiled \\"tween\\" girls who think the the world revolves around them.  In any event, this film has the obligatory (and forgetable) musical numbers that fall flat and don't advance the story, but rather are just an interruption of it.    Save your money, unless you want to entertain young children with the bright colors and fast-moving action.  The story isn't worth the journey through \\"Tangled.\\"
B003QCNFN8|5.0|This abum is AWESOME and it will grow on you. BUY IT! Who cares if Ozzy has sold out and aged. Ozzy is Ozzy until the day he stops breathing! This album is as exceptional as all his other albums. I'm a TRUE fan, been around since NO MORE TEARS and haven't looked back. I'm here 'till Ozzy goes!
B002ZG99QS|1.0|I made the effort to journey to a theater to see the golly-gee-whiz-honest-to-goodness-3D, only to be disappointed in everything with this movie.  The 3D process was wasted on this mess of a movie that was just a lot of computer effects whizzing onto the screen in an blur, coupled with an incomprehensible plot and an ending that was, at best, tacked on in an attempt to make it meaningful.  Based on the reviews here, I'm in the minority, because I wasn't awe-struck with Tron: Legacy, and I certainly don't feel the need to own it, or even watch it again on DVD either.    The best review of this movie was this sentence by critic Bret Fetzer who wrote: \\"For all the techno-babble and quasi-philosophy the characters spout, this is a movie without an idea in its shiny head.\\"  He praised it in other areas, but I liked that comment.  Ditto for me and it was a bore-fest as well.
B00140PK6O|5.0|I thought this was an excellent Movie with many of my favorite actors in it! I loved the long length of it, it lasted all week, it was great! Love Judi Dench she is fabulous and a great inspriration. All of the actors were top notch above their craft!  Keep going! Denice
B0041KKYEW|4.0|Good horror movie..............Tod Browning used a Swan Lake cue for the theme music for his 1931 Dracula and its expanded use in this film is extremely effective.........in fact the Tchaikovsky music is the outstanding feature of this movie.    I have always been a fan of All About Eve and have thought that this movie could easily be filmed as a horror movie.  The Black Swam does this by combining the major elements of that film with Poe's doppleganger story William Wilson where a man deals with his double with tragic results.    Excellent photography, good acting all around make for a fun viewing experience.  Do NOT expect The Red Shoes or The Turning Point...this is horror genre movie making at its best............and again, the music is magnificent!
B001OQCV6K|1.0|Terrible film.................bad music, all characters were miscast, and too much very poor cgi.  The costumes were ridiculous and the sets were poorly designed and dressed.  Most Holmes films are enjoyable...this one was not.
031603438X|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading Life.  When I purchased the kindle version I had no idea it was almost 600 pages.  My reading time is limited but I made it a priority to read Life.  After the first few chapters of a book I can tell if it's going to hold my interest or not and this book did from the first few pages.  I loved the way he expresses himself.  I really think Keith is a fabulous musician and a very interesting, loyal and fun person.  I totally had the wrong impression of him before.  I truly enjoyed looking at all the various photographs of his life also.

B004SCI9BS|5.0|Some people are upset this album isn't as long as the behemoth that is 'First Impressions of Earth'.  But keep in mind, these guys have lives now, some with wives to keep happy and children to attend to.  With the combination of the solo albums that came out in recent years and now with this new album, I do not hold it against them that it is a shorter album.  Heck, their first album 'This is It' was shorter than this one.      Their songs once again are stellar.  They continue to tweak their sound and come up with new things, while still reaching back to the sounds they developed in the past.      Really, this stuff is a breath of fresh air.  Get it now!  Just listen to the samples online, and you'll want to buy it.
0553582038|5.0|Before I mention my opinion of the novel itself, I need to give an account of my bias. I have come late \\"A Song of Ice and Fire.\\" How late? I started reading \\"A Game of Thrones\\" four weeks ago. Accordingly, I have the unique position of neither waiting five years from \\"A Storm of Swords\\" nor having waited nine from \\"A Game of Thrones.\\"    In terms of pacing, \\"A Feast for Crows\\" is much closer to \\"A Game of Thrones\\" than \\"A Clash of Kings\\" or \\"A Storm of Swords.\\" I think Martin did this deliberately and with good editing. Without going into details the first three books functioned like a trilogy that set-up, enacted, and resolved one phase of the conflict sweeping Westeros. \\"A Feast for Crows\\" sets up for the next phase of that conflict. Does this mean that things happen more slowly? Yes. I still enjoyed every page though. If you are expecting this book to be going at the same pace as the previous two, you might be disappointed by the pacing of the events. I think it hangs together well though.    Regarding characters and plot development, I thought that Martin did a superb job of moving the characters in reasonable but unexpected directions. \\"Reasonable\\" here means that characters matured or spoiled in ways true to what we knew of them. I think any reader of the series thus far know what I mean by Martin being \\"unexpected.\\" In some ways this novel was the most introspective of any so far as we came to know the minds of several characters very well.    I hope that Martin quickens the pace for the novel, \\"A Dance with Dragons,\\" but he might have very well structured the final four novels differently than the first three. I am plot committed at this point, so I also hope that Martin quickens the pace of his releases.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Very addicting. Finished both levels in a few days. I don't like that I have to wait a month for next level but a nice way to waste time.
0143113100|5.0|One of the best books I've read.  Ever ask yourself who, what why am I?  When I say I think, therefore I am, what does that really mean?  When I view things around me what makes me conscious?  This is really a great book for the introspectives amongst us.
1600242405|3.0|I'm a huge Stones fan, and Keith's insights were fascinating, but I was disappointed at the limited role that Johnny Depp played in the audio CD. Only the first quarter of the book is read by him; at that point it shifts in grating fashion to another reader.  I just plopped in disc 17, and Depp is back for the closing. The book is still a must for any Stones fan, but just know what's coming.

B002ZG999U|5.0|In the tradition of [[ASIN:B000X418UO Con Air [Blu-ray]]], [[ASIN:B002ZG98C8 Machete]] and [[ASIN:B000059HBA Reindeer Games (Director's Cut)]], the present flick is a pleasure-filled action/comedy romp that is sure to leave you smiling.  One of the best facets of the film is that it doesn't(!) take itself too seriously.  It brings together sundry action stars from the 80s (Sly, Arnie, Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Dolph Lundgren) as well as some more recent stars as well (Jason Statham, Jet Li).<br /><br />If you need for your action flicks to have some sort of hidden message / underlying theme / didactic moral, then the present DVD is likely not for you.  The plot is absurd but the movie doesn't pretend to be something other than what it is.  Just remember:  shoot-em-up movies are always way more fun when mercenaries are involved!
0670022411|5.0|This is a surprisingly wonderful book.  It is not aimed at the teen crowd, though they would certainly enjoy it.

044654146X|4.0|Senor and Singer do a pretty good job in 200 pages of describing, as in their subtitle, Israel's economic miracle. For popular consumption, their story goes something like this: take a highly-networked people with a tradition of learning and argument, back them against a wall physically (Holocaust and wars of survival) and economically (Arab boycott) a few times, and get a miracle. But the question the authors apparently seek to interest some of their readers with -- (how) could other countries repeat the miracle -- leaves something out. Israel is not just any country, or a country of any people. It is the Jewish State. In just the last thousand years of history, many countries brought in Jews and succeeded, then expelled them and declined. Now, in what is truly a miracle, the Jews have gathered in their historic homeland. Can such a synergy be cloned? Can miracles really be manufactured?
B003Y5H53S|5.0|Rango is a very unique animated film that I honestly don't think I can evaluate by traditional animation standards.  Yes, it is animated (a good first outing for special effect giant Industrial Light And Magic, for whom this is their first fully animated film) and yes, there is lots of slapstick material for the family audience, but the true intended audience of Rango is clearly more seasoned moviegoers.  This is an animated film I think will be most appreciated by those who are familiar with the many films it draws inspiration from. Director Gore Verbinski switches gears from his Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy, which had gotten pretty over-the-top by At World's End to deliver a light, enjoyable animated feature.<br /><br />Johnny Depp is the titular \\"Rango\\" - or, at least, that's who he claims to be.  You see, the chameleon was a family pet with an overactive imagination who dreamed of writing plays and acting out heroic characters, but whose true name the audience is never given (no doubt a nod to the Man with No Name western trilogy starring Clint Eastwood).  When he gets lost due to a freak accident in the Mojave Desert his travels take him to the small animal community of Dirt he quickly forges a false identity under the name \\"Rango\\"- a rough, gun blazing icon who once killed seven men with a single bullet!  By chance he also manages to kill the hawk (which happens to sport a steel tipped beak) which only raises his prestige in the town, resulting in his becoming the new town sheriff.<br /><br />Johnny Depp gives a very enjoyable performance as Rango, but I don't think is as \\"likable\\" as the script seems to want him to be- or I should say: he isn't likable in the way a \\"family movie\\" hero should be likable.  He is often cowardly, self-centered, as well as a compulsive liar whose imagination runs rampant.  One scene in particular stands out for Rango's \\"unlikable\\" factor, when the citizens of Dirt are rioting over the water shortage and Rango (who has been thirsty most of the movie) chooses to drink four cups of water while lecturing the citizens on how they can't all get water or else they'd run out.  Naturally he looks like a perfect ass for this entire segment that can't really be sympathized with by the audience.  This is fun for older audiences who like a more flawed protagonist, but at times the script tries too hard to make him seem like a charming, upstanding role-model, when lots of the time he just comes across as a jerk.<br /><br />Most important to know about before seeing Rango is undoubtedly Sergio Leone's Italian made Westerns (Or \\"Spaghetti Westerns\\" as we lovingly tend to call them), particularly the ones featuring Clint Eastwood in his break out role as The Man with No Name.  The music, the look, the atmosphere, and the classic western stand-offs are all in loving tribute of Leone's heavily stylized portrayal of the west.  Aside from the pure Leone Western clich&eacute;s and archetypes the primary plot of Rango surprisingly is taken from Roman Polanski's detective mystery Chinatown.  In both the plot revolves around a city (the small desert community of \\"Dirt\\" replaces L.A.) that is experiencing a severe draught, yet someone is dumping fresh, usable water into the desert, away from the eyes of citizens for some unknown reason.  If you have seen \\"Chinatown\\", Rango makes no attempt of hiding who the antagonist will turn-out to be, as the villain dresses the same as the villain of Chinatown, and has the EXACT same plan involving water and real-estate, but that isn't really bothersome because Rango puts a lot of heart in its tributes to classic films.  They know that they're using Chinatown's plot and I don't think they try to sell this film's plot as being anything other than an excuse to pay tribute to the classics, so this isn't a problem,<br /><br />The secondary antagonist of the film is the one who's already been revealed via trailers: A leather hat wearing serpent by the name of Rattlesnake Jake.  Coming out with a tough as nails voice and a segmented Gatling gun for a rattle this is honestly perhaps the most awesome villain I've seen in an animated film in years!  He even tells a character that he comes from Hell (oh yeah- this film does take a risk for an animated film of using lots of \\"Damns\\" and \\"Go to Hell!\\" type talk that parents wouldn't want repeated by their children).  With all the other sentient animals in this film (it will always bug me why some animals in here are anthromorphic and sentient while others, like the roadrunners, are not...) it is really impressive to see how the folk from Industrial Light And Magic were able to bring credibility to a snake being capable of doing the same things as all the other critters, even with the lack of hands.<br /><br />Jake is voiced amazingly well by British actor Bill Nighy, who, like Depp, previously worked with director Gore Verbinski in the Pirates of the Caribbean films, portraying tentacle-faced ship captain Davy Jones.  He really must have had fun doing this outlaw of a Diamondback Rattlesnake (who is so villainous he even has a little moustache pattern on the scales above his mouth!). I'm serious, this villain is just pure fun to watch.  He is every-single awesome outlaw stereotype wrapped up in a delicious, slivering package!  He has a foot (tail?) in for being a likely pick if I choose to compile a list of my favorite villains for the 2011 movie season.<br /><br />Gore Verbenski and composer Hans Zimmer made it apparent that they had a mutual love of Sergio Leone and Ennio Morricone's musical scores.  Once more Zimmer reflects on the themes of \\"The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly\\" and \\"Once Upon A Time In The West\\" with extraordinary effectiveness.<br /><br />Rango is not a perfect animated movie, nor do I think young children will appreciate it as much as viewers in their upper teens and older.  It won't traumatize any kids, but it probably is far too intense for them, and the best of the film's humor they'll likely have no hope in understanding due to not being exposed to the countless films referenced- many of which are rated R films from the 1960s-1970s.  There's Chinatown and the Leone Spaghetti Westerns, but other films I saw referenced include: Apocalypse Now, Star Wars, The Wizard of Oz, any given zombie movie, and I'm sure there were many more that have simply slipped my mind.<br /><br />As a standalone film I do think Rango was mighty entertaining for what it was- a loving tribute to the western genre and other classic films.voice and a segmented Gatling gun for a rattle this is honestly perhaps the most awesome villain I've seen in an animated film in years!

0307266303|5.0|The book is written beautifully.  It's part story, part interesting fact sheet, part how to.  I'd like to address the how-to part.  When you start barefoot running or running in minimalist shoes be gentle with yourself. The lightness and freedom encourages you to run forever.  But if your muscles and tendons haven't adjusted, you will suffer.
B004L49K20|5.0|The deluxe edition of this title adds a fifteenth track, \\"Networker Nation\\", but the real reason to get this is the DVD. It features behind the scenes footage and interviews about the making of the album. There's also a track by track commentary on all but three of the cuts (two of them are brief instrumentals anyway). Some highlights include the title track of which the video appears on the DVD, and \\"Leave A Light On\\". Some of the others sound a little reminiscent of their '82 album Rio. I'm not a big fan of the three-sided gatefold packaging but at least you won't have to worry about fragile jewel boxes.    As someone who grew up listening to them in the eighties, I was pleasantly surprised at how great this album sounds as a whole. Anyone who liked their older material, whether they're a long time fan or a new one will find themselves moving to this album. It underscores the fact that there is some great rock music still out there.
1594202842|3.0|Just a few things:<br /><br />1. This is a \\"memoir\\", it is not a \\"parenting guide\\"... it should not be taken as a \\"parenting guide\\"... Amy Chua drives this fact home in her oft confused and contradictory statements.<br /><br />2. There is no ending to this book... even despite the ending being discussed within the book itself... Amy Chua's frustration with finding a proper ending (even with the aid of her daughters) culminates to a dribbling, clumsy finish with no real point or conclusion.<br /><br />3. The book is entertaining, her daughters are refreshing and endearing, and Amy Chua... well, it's pretty impossible to read this book and not have an opinion about Amy Chua...

0316017922|3.0|Gladwell's overall theme in the book is nobody gets there alone.  Hopefully by the end of the book, the readers will change their opinion of success.  Being labeled a genius with a high IQ doesn't guarantee success.  The uncontrollable factors that give individuals the opportunities for success like where or when their are born control the chances they will have to reach success.  The way ancestors behaved can still be seen in generations today, as well as cultural customs that are impairing or improving one's chances of success.  Most importantly the practice it takes to become successful isn't something everyone has the opportunity to do.  If these opportunities are all presented to you, and you make the most of them, success is likely to happen.       This is a book I can relate to personally.  A lot of Gladwell's ideas are ones that aren't commonly pointed out.   Once the ideas are presented, they seem to be seen everywhere.  I now realize I have met many Outliers in my life.  The book was chosen for this course because the instructor felt it showed research alongside opinions.  Gladwell interviews a lot of people, who get referenced in the Notes section.  They even have an index for this book, which is great for finding data.      I thought this was a good book, and would be interested in reading his other works.  The thought provoking nature of the writing kept my attention, and made it an easier read.  He is very detailed, which eliminates confusion from readers.  The subjects he discusses are unique and I'm glad he pointed out what so many overlook.  I was surprised when I saw a picture of him after I read his book; he writes from such an expert point of view I thought he would have been much older.
B001DF68MA|4.0|Last year we enjoyed riding with our 1 yr-old son in a Bell rear-mounted seat.  Now that he's almost 2 and 30 lbs I've noticed that the bike doesn't feel as stable during our rides with the rear-mounted seat so I started looking for alternatives.  I thought I'd give the WeeRide a try and felt the price was reasonable compared to most other bike seats. It wasn't terribly difficult to mount on my bike-I did need some assistance from my husband. The seat is quite small and as with previous reviews the straps are a bit of a pain to adjust. I had to fiddle quite a bit with them to loosen them up enough to get my son strapped in.  The seat is supposed to fit kids up to 4 years or 40 lbs-not sure how that would happen since my son isn't even 2yrs yet and I can't imagine kids much bigger fitting into this seat.  Riding with the seat is a bit different since you do have to splay your knees out a bit.  I'm almost 5'7'' and find that if I shift my weight back further in my own seat this helps.  The inside of my knees do still brush the seat occasionally, but to me it's not a big deal. Riding up hills will be a challenge if you're out of shape since standing up to pedal is quite difficult-I did not have a problem with this. My son really does enjoy being up front and I feel much more stable on the bike with him in front of me now. Overall I am very happy with this purchase and even if my son outgrows the seat after this year it was worth it!
0316098337|5.0|What a fabulous book!  This is a remarkable story about a life none of us could imagine and the characters are so engaging and \\"scave\\"!  You will not be able to put this book down!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|they finally stopped giving us free apps.  oh well it was nice while it lasted.  Anyway.  this version is nice and better graphics, I have loved angry birds but this the best of them all
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Adele cd  was better than I expected everyone and anyone should have this CD in there music collection,the first track is my most favorite,but the rest of the CD is great too.
B002XMGGJM|4.0|I loved the movie until the ending ruined it for me. Why does Hollywood have to have happy or justice (good always beats bad). They treat us like morons. They've ruined so many movies with unrealistic endings. Some of us live in the real world. Justice is not always fair or just. I love how the movie points out the flaws of the justice system. Hell life is full of flaws. I gave it 4 stars but that is being generous. Why? Because endings that don't flow with the rest of the movie are like WTF! I don't even mind endings that let your imagination fill in the blanks. But how do we go from Butler's character being brilliant throughout the whole film to Foxx beating him at the end. So they just magically decided to take a closer look at his finances. What a surprise, how did we miss this, oh yeah the movie needs to have the so-called villian taken down. I'm not saying I would enjoy people die in real life. But unfortunately real life has so many sad but true endings. Worth a rental but not a purchase. IMO.
B0084I9QI2|5.0|Lovely item great price!
B004NSULHM|5.0|Certainly, Radiohead are about an entire century ahead of everyone else, sort of like Herman Melville's Moby Dick being released in 1851 to . . . nothing. The titan of a book wasn't even in circulation when the poor man died.  This music is nothing short of brilliant, another stroke of genius from the band that started as has-beens (Pablo Honey) to emerge as bonafide art rock gods on the strength of one band-altering album (The Bends). They've only gotten smarter, and even their slight slip-ups (Hail to the Thief) are more stunning than anything anyone else is doing.
0316010669|4.0|Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking by Malcolm Gladwell interestingly enough is a book that will make you think about thinking. The idea that most of our decisions are made in the blink of an eye and that we can't even explain the reasoning behind them is intriguing and sometimes a little scary. Readers may find themselves pausing while going about their everyday activities to question a decision they made without realizing they made it. Gladwell describes the concept in a way that leaves the reader wondering why they never thought of the points he makes. His examples give a deeper understanding of the idea of making a decision without knowing why even if the examples are sometimes experiments that make the reader squirm a little as they read. The section where Gladwell discusses a military exercise gives a moment's pause about the inflexibility of military thinking but could also be applied to any situation that pits two groups against one another. Gladwell also spends quite a bit of time talking about the results of testing that examine our preconceived and possibly subconscious thoughts about others. He explains the benefits and the pitfalls of thinking without thinking. Blink is a simple but powerful and fascinating look into the way our brain works often without our knowledge to make split-second decisions.
B004SCI9BS|5.0|Certainly, The Strokes's albums 2 and 3 had their moments, but this fourth is quite fine indeed. OK, 'Gratisfaction' takes some getting used to. It's best to go in knowing the lyrics! Print them out and study them, then get going. There's so much in here, much like Radiohead's latest stunner King of Limbs, another that is far more than the sum of its parts.

0321525655|5.0|Presentation Zen is the Go Rin No Sho (A Book of Five Rings) of books on preparing and making presentations.  Misuse of presentation tools like MS PowerPoint has almost killed the art.  This book revives it, and has transformed the way I think about, prepare for, and give oral presentations.
1594202559|5.0|Mallaby writes an in depth account of many of the most famous hedge fund managers.  The book covers how these famous hedge funds came to be as well as how they were affected or destroyed by certain financial crises.  My only complaint is that interesting information was occasionally found in the notes and citations, so it was frustrating having to flip to the back of the book to see there was anything interesting to be read.

B002VPE1B6|3.0|I waited to see this movie, ignoring my friends who kept hyping it to me.  Finally saw it and, while quite lovely, it was a bit less than I expected.    Beautiful visuals (especially on BR), simplistic plot, nice fight scenes, lovely aliens--don't we all wish we could have such tall, thin, perfect bodies--and a message that you couldn't avoid tripping over.  That didn't bother me too much...save for the in-your-face way that the aliens reminded one of Native Americans, even down to the paint for rituals and warfare, and that the mineral the military-corperations wanted was called (seriously?!?!?) \\"unobtainium.\\"  \    We could have used a teeny bit more backstory about how the Earth had been used up and that was why the corporation was mining Pandora, and the part about Jake's brother seemed missing some detail.  Probably, the director just wanted to jump us right into Pandora.  There was also no explanation of how mountains were floating in the air.  And, maybe, something could have been said about how the name Pandora means \\"all gifts.\\"  The name of the planet-goddess also seemed quite similar to Gaia.  Again, pretty obvious.          Overall, a mixed blessing of a movie.  Rather too simplistic for adults and, maybe, it could have used some time edited out, but okay otherwise.  Honestly, a pretty movie, but no award-winner.
0316017922|4.0|This book was thoroughly entertaining. It explored the requirements of success and how either wits, hard work, or just plain luck can affect your chances of succeeding. The way Gladwell wrote this bookis that he finds many examples of the cases he tries to make and ties them together to form a conclusive idea. One of the most interesting ideas that he formulated was that for a hockey player to have the best chance of becoming great, he/she must be born on January 1st. He showed how many GREAT players in the past had all been born close to this day and proved this by showing that all the cutoffs for the premier teams happened right before January 1st. All players born on January 1st would be put into higher ranking groups because of their age advantage over everyone else in the age range (i.e January 1st-December 31st). This book was interesting to read due to all the facts and threads that tied the book together, but left me hanging at some parts due to the lack of excitement or prodding me to read the next page. I would still recommend this book, though. -Written by a 7th grader
B00000DI06|5.0|I have the Rutter Requiem on vinyl {a format which I prefer} which is coupled with Psalm 121.   Regretably I damaged to LP so needed a new LP, unfortunately I cannot trace one so took this CD as a temporary replacement {I still want the LP - so if anyone has it let me know aitchphoto@btinternet.com}.  This CD is brilliant the requiem is well performed as is the magnificat with a great soundstage which came across well on my speakers it is almost as good as vinyl.   The diction was clear and well focussed as was the Oboe solo which is beautiful, all in all a great CD, glad I bought it.  As normal when I want something I always try Amazon, they have always come up with the anwer.
B002WY65VU|4.0|I finally had a chance to see Zombieland last night, something I had been looking forward to since it came out, but never got marked off my list. I was not disappointed. (So why not 5 stars? Well, there weren't that many zombies....)    Seriously though, I thought the movie was charming on many levels. The awkward relationships blooming into enough trust to tell your deepest secrets; the coping mechanisms for dealing with a post-apocalyptic reality; the rules -- these things were great. And the Bill Murray role was small but brilliant.    A bit of a warning though, to those with weak stomachs -- the first time we tried to watch this (as we inevitably are watching movies with dinner) we had to turn it off, because the gore in the opening credit sequence was a bit much with a meal. However, that was the only really gory section of the film, and once the credits were out of the way, it was easy to sit back and enjoy the mayhem.    The cast was great. Loved Woody Harrelson for the first time in a long time. Jesse Eisenberg was not really someone I had seen much, if anything, of prior to this, but now I might be willing to sit through The Social Network.  Emma Stone is someone else whose name I had seen, but none of her work. Now, I might go looking. And, of course, Abigail Breslin is always dynamite. She is definitely an actress to pay attention to.    All in all, I enjoyed the film immensely, and recommend it highly.
B0041KKYEM|1.0|Horrible movie, not worth the rental fee. After seeing the movie there is no way that Natalie Portman did all of her own dancing or even 95% of the dancing. Weird and disconnected glad I didn't waste the money and see it when it was still in the theater.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|Okay, so I am an avid Disney fan...have seen every princess movie and admittedly was not expecting much from this movie. To date I've seen it 6 times (twice in theater and four times since getting it from amazon-I did the pre-order), I love the characters, and while there are things I'm not over the top about (namely the creepy half naked drunk midget man running around dressed like cupid) it still makes me laugh and enjoy watching it. I haven't been this excited about a Disney princess movie since The Little Mermaid, so if you haven't seen it and you're on the fence about it-watch it. (As I write this I have one of the songs stuck in my head)

Tried it from the strictest point (induction) - broke down at the weekends! I hate eggs and bacon now...lost 5 lbs in two weeks. I'm sure it will work very well for people who are more dedicated, I thought I was. It did identify my craving for carbs of any kind....I shall read on and perhaps have a stab at OWL (ongoing weight loss).
B001IF252M|5.0|Quite a steep price for a small component but gets the job done.  I am a student and use this when making presentations.
0312360258|5.0|Okay so.. I absolutely loved the book! The whole Vampire and Blood sucking action had me glued. The fact that she, or they i should say have a big open imagination made it fun to read. I disagree hands down to the people who said it was boring i mean if you wanted action Freakin find an action novel or better yet write your own damn book make it the way you wanna. This is a great series that is worth reading but if your finicky and pick out every little freaking mistake then this book is so not for you. Happy Reading:)
B0041KKYBA|5.0|Inside Job is a very important and well-produced documentary on the financial collapse. It covers the economics and the personalities which give rise to the collapse.  Everyone in the world should watch this movie.
B004J4RQIM|5.0|I saw portions of this on a PBS telethon, so bought Blue Ray video and CD audio.  We loved the music, the high quality of the Blue Ray and the high sound quality.  A great price through Amazon.  So glad we purchsed.  Plan to buy the first Hit Man.
B000002ADT|2.0|I like the album, but be wary.....whomever did the remastering should be banned from any other duties in the studio.  Distortion, loud hiss, and other unexplained sounds ruin the enjoyment of the album.    I recommend you stay away from the \\"remastered\\" version.
031603438X|5.0|This is a rollicking good read,full of gossip and re-telling of famous incidents that are the stuff of rock and roll legend. But Keith Richards brings much more to the table here: sensitive and affectionate recollections of a Dartford childhood and the family members who inspired and encouraged his early love of music. He comes across as rather wise - someone who hasn't lost his head on the road to fame and riches. Yes, there is epic drug abuse, and he chronicles this with honesty and sometimes wry humour. But throughout the book it is clear that, for Keith Richards, the journey has never been primarily about the money... the women... the hedonism... or the celebrity. It has been about the music. 'Life' is a fast and fascinating read for anyone interested in rock history. I love the ending, and how he brings his story right back to Dartford with the passing of his mother and a delightful memory of her 'first review' of his music. I closed the book thinking, \\"I like this man\\".
B000002ADT|5.0|I'm not a fan of all-out loosely roaming jazz arrangements, and there isn't any of that on this CD. I think this melodic album would be enjoyable for anybody -- and for a long, long time.
B004SBS8LA|3.0|Easily the worst of the Angry Birds franchise. Levels are more frustrating than satisfying, new enemies are ridiculous, and the movie tie-ins are just painful. But it's a new Angry Birds, so you're gonna get it anyway.
B004S5BPAC|5.0|Christian Bail was once again an outstanding performer. Marky Walberg was Mehhhh. Anyways, good movie, good acting, and most important good Story line.
0061726826|4.0|Lauren Oliver knows how to write a story.<br /><br />The action and suspense in Delirium is well written and had me in its grip. I did not feel the love connection between Lena and Alex, it felt more like Lena was more intrigued by Alex's life than Alex himself. But that was still okay because of how well Lauren Oliver writes. Does that make sense?<br /><br />What I don't like is the ending. Same thing I felt with Before I Fall. I did not want the story to end the way it ended. But then, who's to say what appears to happen, really happened? Book 2? If there is a book 2, I'll be reading it if anything to find out.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|I just recently became a Gamer 4 months ago on Xbox 360. My Game of Choice \\"Black OPS\\" In the beginning, I was getting 4-7 kills per game. But I decided to step it up with TB Ear Force X41, and wow what a difference. Yes, I read some of the Poor reviews on here but there only one way to find out if they are true or Not. In my Case, these headphones blew my mind out, Clarity is so clear, 7.1 surround sound is so good you could here bullet shells landing on the floor while still being able to hear enemies coming your way from certain directions. My voice control is also beyond expectation, I could control the volume of voices without changing the volume of the game, awesome. The wireless feature is so cool, no wires dangling any where, I don't have to worry if someone walks in front of me while playing the game, cause there is no wires to trip on. I also like that everything is detachable like the headphone mic and the control to headset voice control, there's just times that I just want to hear the game only and not interact with others, I also hooked up my T.V. to it, so I like listening to my T.V. shows as well with out a mic or control wire. Set up was less then 1 minute it only took seconds. Headphones are comfortable. One thing I really really recommend is to buy some rechargeable batteries, even though batteries last a long time on this headset, it's always good to have a pair of batteries ready to swap. So bottom line, 4-7 kills per game increased to 25-35 kills in just less then one week. If you're ever in a Room with FIRESPARK < GAME TAGGER NAME, Watch out cause I know your every move.
0375842209|5.0|The novel The Book Thief was the first book I had read by Markus Zusak but from the very first page I was captivated. It is narrated by Death, who shares the story of a young girl named Liesel living in Nazi Germany. She is orphaned from a young age and all she has left to remember her family by is a book she stole while at her brother's funeral. It's not until her foster family takes her in and she begins to learn to read that she develops an avid love for reading. She begins to steal books at which point Death gives her the nickname \\"The Book Thief\\". The plot thickens further as Liesel's foster family ends up hiding a Jew in their basement.    The main reason this book is so unique and captivating is the style in which Zusak writes. He describes simple things in beautiful, poetic ways that stretch your imagination and makes you ponder if your perception of things is really the correct view. He crafts sentences with grace and flow that other writing seems bland and lacking. For example, he describes a red sky like \\"soup, boiling and stirring. In some places, it was burned. There were black crumbs, and pepper, streaked across the redness.\\" He also manages to make his narrator, Death, poetic and relatable. \\"A human doesn't have a heart like mine. The human heart is a line, whereas my own is a circle, and I have the endless ability to be in the right place at the right time. The consequence of this is that I'm always finding humans at their best and worst. I see their ugly and their beauty, and I wonder how the same thing can be both.\\" Even though this book is fun of action and drama it still has the power to make you stop and think about the simple phrases Zusak uses to make his point.     This book is a gem, a rare find that come only once in a great while. It's poetic beauty in describing Nazi Germany and the people living there is unique and chilling. It gives you a new look on World War II and the effects it had on the people living in Germany.  It made me laughand cry and truly care about the characters. The Book Thief is one-of-a-kind and you'll want to read it again and again.

In skiing parlance, I keep thinking of Moore paying to get her husband seduced but ending up (by mistake perhaps) with a \\"Family Pass\\" - albeit the season closed early. At least one closure that they can't blame on Global Warming.

B000JBWWQ0|5.0|The film had a very good cast, however a lot was left out from the book and almost made it seem unrealistic. Very suspenseful with not much plot.  Sure the Celestine is up there with the Da Vinci Code and all the lost relic stories, but I feel it was too short to actually make a difference.<br /><br />I love the book and those that followed, but to purchase a sequel....I'm not to sure.
B004PA50JM|4.0|Their best in years may not be saying much but this truly sounds like the R.E.M. that I fell in love with.  Mike Mills backing vocals which have been sorely missed as of late are finally back (excuse the pun) and Peter Buck is playing with a sense of purpose.  Stipe is slowly moving back towards his non-sensical lyrics and that is a good thing.  Even the guest vocalists shine.  Eddie Vedder is a great surprise and Patti Smith is in fine form on \\"Blue\\" which is a distant cousin of Country Feedback, one of the finest songs they've ever recorded.
B004LFO0ME|3.0|Hip Hop's Rookie of the Year, Wiz Khalifa, has been having a buzz in the rap game for a good minute right now. Last year, he caught my attention with his mixtape Kush & OJ full of smoked out songs that anyone can vibe to. Since then I became a fan of his music as well as other mixtapes hes released (most notabily Cabin Fever). One benefit of making mixtapes is that you don't have to worry about your label's hands in what songs you can put out, leaving you in full control of what your fans wanting to hear. So when he releases his debut Rolling Papers you can pretty much can expect its not going to be like those mixtapes hes released in the past, because Atlantic Records is going to try to appeal to a larger crowd focusing on sales. The lead single \\"Black & Yellow\\" was catchy enough to give them what they wanted.<br /><br />With the album itself is not as bad as one would expect. There are a lot of great tracks on here to satisfy fans of Wiz. He works better on dark smoked out beats like \\"On My Level\\" featuring Too $hort. \\"Star of the Show\\" featuring Chevy Woods is another that falls into this category, and is a huge standout from a lyrical standpoint. The songs appealing to larger crowds, like \\"Roll Up\\" (2nd single), \\"Get Your Sh..\\", and \\"Fly Solo\\" makes Wiz sounds forced and out of place. Lyrically Wiz holds his own with his own rap style like on \\"The Race\\", and the aforementioned \\"Star of the Show\\". Production here helps out a lot as well, as all the beats on help matches Wiz' flow. As I mentioned before, I find Wiz to be at his best when he is making songs over darker, more funkdafied beats.<br /><br />The overall product itself is very good. Sure everyone is not going to be happy with his debut after hearing some of his work prior to this release. I will not say I'm fully satisfied with the album myself, as my biggest fear is that he is going to join a long list of rappers who releases mixtapes that are better than their actual albums. When you developed a loyal fanbase through that route, it's hard to please them when you have a powerhouse record label like WEA telling you what songs to make. I'm sure there are a lot of songs that could have been on here that didn't make it (ie \\"Black & Yellow (remix)\\", \\"2 Timez \\"(feat. Gucci Mane) just to name a few). But for right now, I'm glad that Rolling Papers has been released, and will have a moderate amount of rotation for the time being. If you have not tracked down some of Wiz' previous work, I recommend you do so asap.

B004NSULHM|4.0|At first listen, King of Limbs doesn't sound like a band effort but listen closer and you'll hear everyone participating.  \\"I wish there were more guitars\\" is a sentiment often shared by fans of Radiohead over the last few years but shouldn't we be used to the fact that Johnny likes to avoid taking the expected path by now?

B0047WJ12K|5.0|If you haven't seen it you should. I could follow it...Maybe because I heard others couldn't.  Remember the song by pink floyd from \\"the machine\\" where it says, \\"you dreamed of being a big rock star...\\"\\"we told you what to dream!\\"  Just think of how this correlates to what commercials and our popular culture do to us. We are programed from infancy. The people in Gaza have a completely different program...don't they? Inception is a beautiful metaphor; (if that's the right word) I loved it.

0553805371|2.0|I agree the physical book itself is a quality production.  I have become extremely interested in cosmology in recent years as a way to show how all things taught in science are related.  I have read quite a number of texts and each helps with my understanding on one issue or another, so I keep looking for explanations from different perspectives .  I found a few explanations of the quantum world in this book very helpful.  However, the principle thrust did seem to promote the authors views on God and on M theory.  I could find no referencing or suggestions for further reading. To make there case, the authors speak of a number of theories and interpretations of evidence as though they are universally accepted, which I suspect are not.  For instance, they rely heavily on the theory of inflation, for which I did not see, on my reading, credit given to Alan H. Guth. I do not know how generally this theory is accepted, but a look at the April 2011 issue of Scientific American provides some idea.  I did, however, find the authors personal views interesting.  Finally, as another reviewer noted, the size of print used for the authors names raised questions.  I too felt this was better written than other Stephen Hawking books.

B002ZCY7SW|5.0|I'm a die hard 24 fan, but even I have to admit it had lost its way since the excellent Season 5. 6 and 7 were increasingly ridiculous (even by 24's standards), 24 Redemption (to me) seemed a little lame and fairly pointless, and my hopes for this final season weren't high. How wrong I was...     The series this time moves to New York, and the main plot concerns a peace treaty between the US, Russia and a fictional Arab nation. Terrorists are determined to halt the treaty by assassinating the Arab President (a superb performance by Bollywood actor Anil Kapoor) before it is signed. Of course, there are the usual twists and turns (though -- thankfully -- nowhere near as many as in season 7), and inevitably the now-retired Jack is brought reluctantly back into the front line to save the day.     This isn't so much as a new 24, but a return to the old style. The tension builds slowly as the clock ticks; there is much more emphasis (like the old days) on creating tension than all out drama. Sure, (naturally) lots of dramatic things happen, but it just felt much more balanced, and less OTT than it had become -- like it used to be. That said, though, when things do get hot then it is as explosive and intense as ever. No spoilers, but the last 4 episodes in particular are as good as any season. It's up there with 5 for a breathtaking finale!...     The acting, again, is first class (especially the Arabian presidential family, and again Cherry Jones returning as President Taylor). A couple of old \\"friends\\" turn up during the course and really add to the drama. Kim is also in New York (but doesn't need rescuing this time around!) and Chloe is still struggling to sort out the muddles at CTU! Freddie Prinze Jr. is solid as the new lead CTU field agent Cole Cortez (a little similar to Chase in Season 3). There are a couple of goofy side plots (as always), but they don't detract from the strong central stories which develop (and nothing as bad as Kim's babysitting adventure!...)Personally, my only quibble is (and it's more about the series as a whole than season 8) that I think they shouldn't have overused Nina Meyers in seasons 2 and 3. I think it would have been the perfect ending to the series if they had saved her showdown with Jack till the last act, bringing it full circle to a more natural conclusion. Other than that, this is one of my favourite series, and season 8 one of my favourite 24 seasons. I can't really separate it from 1 and 5 -- they are all brilliant in different ways. 3 was next best then 6, 2, 4 and 7. That's only my opinion, though!...     I'm sad that it has finished, but I'm glad it found it's form again before bowing out. Hopefully the film that is planned will be made... (Either that or they'll all miss it so much after a couple of years they'll do another season!)
B004G6009K|5.0|By far the best 3D animation I've seen, and a cute tail with humor and a bit of \\"musical\\" well balanced throughout.
B0034G4P7G|5.0|This was much better than I expected it to be (I expected it -- like Zuckerberg himself -- to be annoying!) It's true, for the first half an hour or so (as you acclimatise to the Harvard setting, and Zuckerberg's petty hostility toward (and inability to interact with) the social side of campus life) it is as annoying as expected, but you do get involved and it does become a great film.     Everything is very well shot: the campus atmosphere captured perfectly and the acting is first rate (especially Andrew Garfield as -- the only character who is really likeable -- Eduardo Saverin). It doesn't really follow a standard plot -- the story of how Facebook was founded (and how quickly it became a global success) is interspersed with two subsequent lawsuits against Zuckerberg -- though it is simple enough to follow. I think the main reason this works (as others have mentioned -- as well as the excellent direction by Fincher) is that Zuckerberg (and most of his peers) are portrayed as being just as irresponsible and foolish as you expect them to be! This isn't the story of how a genius founded a global empire, but of how someone with little social skills managed (through a combination of hard work, other peoples ideas (largely stolen) and sheer luck) managed to revolutionise the Social Networking phenomenon. It portrays him as a dedicated professional and programming genius, but with little charisma or morality. If it had tried to idolise him, then it would probably have lost me early on; as I say, after the first 30 minutes, I was totally riveted.     It's not necessarily something you will watch often, but you will be glad you watched. In a nuthsell: you'll probably enjoy it much more and it will irritate you much less than you thought it would. It won't make you \\"like\\" Facebook or Zuckerberg if you don't already, but you will at least gain satisfaction (in this version of events) that it was set up by annoying pratts!

1400067936|5.0|Simply a very good treatise of randomness and how we are fooled by it. A topical case in point is the April 2011 Southwest Airlines mechanical failure on the Phoenix to Sacramento route. Clearly, a random occurrence, but SW grounded most of their planes for inspection. What were they inspecting before this problem happened? Who knows, but if they were inspecting for this kind of failure, they missed it on this plane. I'm guessing they don't inspect for this kind of thing, but it will be added to their list now. But they can't inspect for ALL failures, because they don't have infinite time.    We act as if random catastrophic events WILL NOT HAPPEN. Reading this book will not prevent these types of events, but your thinking may be altered to include the possibility of this random events when you are making choices.
0545123283|3.0|I'm sorry to say that just like with Shiver I felt Linger was lacking. I was momentarily gripped when Isabelle and Cole met, but as that relationship sort of fizzled out, my interest in the book did too.<br /><br />Mostly my problem with Linger (as well as Shiver) is my inability to connect with the lead romantic couple Sam and Grace.  This is a very subjective thing I know. But given the fact that it doesn't take much for me to swoon over romantic couples (Bella & Edward, Cabel & Janie, Jace & Clary, Valek & Yelena) to name a few, it is quite strange how when I read about Sam tossing and turning in bed because he misses Grace so much, my reaction is: yawn. Why is that?<br /><br />It may be because I'm missing sparks and passion. I don't for a minute doubt that they love each other very much, but it's all so careful, quiet and lovey-dovey. Which, once again, some might like to read about, but I need something with a little more life in it. That's why I loved the new addition of Cole, because he brought some life and sparks to the story, that previously only Isabelle had provided.<br /><br />My other main reason for yawning my way through this book was the non-existent plot. Already in the first couple of pages, we get a hint of what is to happen to Grace. Yet it takes all of the 400 pages to get there. And in between? Not so much, really. Cole's background story is told, and there is the friction between Grace's parents and Sam. But other than that, it felt like I read about all the four of them basically going on about their life, doing mundane things like calling each other, turning a pillow in a bed, driving their cars, looking at the wolves, pondering and questioning and worrying.<br /><br />It helps of course that these mundane events are told in the words of Maggie Stiefvater, who can make a trip to the bathroom sound like poetry. She is extremely good with words, there is no denying that. Unfortunately though, no amount of beautifully phrased prose can save a non-existent plot (in my view).<br /><br />I have to say though that the ending was quite spectacular. I loved how Cole stepped up to the plate when it really mattered (Cole's my man!), and the whole explanation behind the werewolf curse was interesting as well.<br /><br />Did those last 10 pages make up for the rest? Not really. But a good ending always leaves you intrigued, and so I may actually pick up the third installment Forever, to be released next summer.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Grade: 3/5I have to say though that the ending was quite spectacular.

Ok, but if what's above the surface is rendered in such a tedious fashion, I fail to see the brilliance in it.  For me, the words on the page have to have some life beyond just pointing to hidden meaning.  I mean, can a book be considered great if the reading experience is so empty and it's only value is in the interpretation?  I say no, no it cannot.
B004AHNIGM|5.0|This is a very good album from an \\"old lion\\" like Gregg is. The sound is very...old-style I'd say, full and warm, it reminds me of a time when music was not just a piece of plastic with a good song and ten fillers. That's the reason I call it an \\"album\\" not simply a \\"cd\\". There's a fantastic band playin' here, with Doyle Bramhall, Mac Rebennack etc. And \\"Just Another Rider\\", written together with Warren Haynes is simply beautiful, the peak of this \\"Low Country Blues\\", to me.
B003UESJDS|5.0|&quot;Paperback writer (paperback writer)<br />Dear Sir or Madam, will you read my book?<br />It took me years to write, will you take a look?&quot;<br />-- The Beatles<br /><br />Based on a graphic novel this story plays more like a Greek Tragedy.  It does not quit fit into any category. Still you will find yourself intrigued and kibitzing. Oh what a tangled web we weave.<br /><br />Local girl Tamara (Gemma Arterton) gets a new proboscis and body to match. After making good as a journalist she returns to her hometown and plays havoc with the local men folk. And that is not all that is happing in the town. To name a couple, we have a married writer with a wondering uh...err... eye, and a couple of schoolgirls playing out their fantasies.<br /><br />Be prepared for some colorful descriptive words and some suggestive scenes. The only poignant scene that sort of puts a damper on the presentation is when a main character (four-legged) is dispatched while having a little fun, even if it is relevant to the plot.<br /><br />I only watched the Blu-ray version so I cannot compare. However the voice over commentary is worth taking the time to listen to. I also have not read the novel but will have to to be sure I did not miss anything.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000ALM4EE The Girl Most Likely To . . .DVD ~ Stockard Channing]]

0321704452|5.0|If you have to do any presentations - or lectures - or talks of any kind - you owe it to yourself (and your audiences) to read Garr Reynolds' books. He has fundamentally changed how I think about any presentation.     But I thought after Presentation Zen and Presentation Zen Design, he'd said everything he had to say. I was wrong. The Naked Presenter is a great addition. A slim volume, well written, and a good (and fun) read. In it, he goes beyond what he said in Presentation Zen in a most interesting and worthwhile way. I started reading this book one evening and was bemused and amazed to realize how late it was when I finished it that night. Buy this book - along with the others. Your audiences/classes/fellow inmates will appreciate it immensely.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I started reading this book and instantly knew that I would Love it.  The way she explains everything, it is like you can see it, like a movie.  And I love that.  The characters are wonderful and you get to really know them.  This was a very interesting topic she is writing the book about, very different, and I like that.     But I did see Battle Royale, a Japanese movie, and it is this book.  This movie came out in 2001, and it is very, very close to her book.  OR...her book is very close to the movie.      I doesn't matter to me, I read the book first, and I loved it, and I am looking forward to the movie of her book.
0312370849|2.0|This novel is told from brief chapter to brief chapter with the Point of View swapping back and forth between a 3rd person story about Sarah during WWII and its aftermath and a first person story about a journalist named Julia who is researching Sarah's story. About half way through, the book becomes completely first person Julia.  There is the problem.  Sarah's story is interesting, poignant and appealing;  Julia is unsympathetic and silly.  Lots of coincidences not at all believable conspire to have Julia uncover information about Sarah that dovetails into consequences in her own life.  Julia's occupation as a journalist allows her to tell a great deal of the story of the victims of Vel d'Hiv as she is uncovering information from written sources, so it reads at times like a newspaper article, rather than the author having fashioned a novel from her research.  There are many, many better things to read about this subject.

As an adult, I don't get bored either..wondering what hat/clothes/activities I want to do too!
0545123283|5.0|I was VERY reluctant to pick up this book after I finished the first one.  In fact I waited about 2 months before I started reading it after I read Shiver because Shiver was such a perfect book with a perfect ending that I didn't want that perfection to disapper in a 2nd book that might not measure up.  While the ending of Linger had me shedding some serious tears and longing for the perfect ending that the 1st book offered, it was still a perfect compliment to Shiver.  I hate that I have to wait until July now to see how it all ends.<br />I really enjoyed how instead of just telling the story from Grace and Sam's POV they added in Isabel and Cole (one of the new wolves).  I wasn't impressed with Isabel in the first book but I grew to love her in Linger.  Even with her massivly hard outer shell and harder inner shell she really cares deep down in her core.  I had anticipated Cole to be some sort of trouble maker that ruins everything but in his way (the only way) he saves the day.  Grace's parents finally decide to act like parents and **possible spoiler** I'm soooooo glad Grace steps up and rebels against them.<br />When reading this, Maggie has a way of writing that makes me forget that they are just teens.  I've been out of my teens for a while now and I feel myself relating to the characters and really feeling what they're feeling.<br /><br />I'm really kind of at a loss for words on this book other than to say I loved it.........read it!!!!
0385737424|3.0|The author was ambitious, overly ambitious. At first I thought that the story was getting lost in a sea of incidents. By the time I was halfway through I wasn't sure if there was any story at all. By the end of the book, I realized that author spent too much time on gimmicks and preachy messages to develop a rich and engaging story. This kitchen-sink book touches upon a number of social issues and themes. That number proves to be to high and as a result she's not able to say anything meaningful about any of them. It would have been better to develop a few arguments rather than just rambling incoherently about everything. The worst of all gimmicks are the allusions to both \\"A Wrinkle In Time\\" and \\"20,000 Dollar Pyramid\\". You end up with two weak analogous devices where she could have developed on strong one. The book read quickly and the central character is engaging and real, but less is more. She didn't have to put every idea she had into one book.

1439102724|5.0|Masterfully written. The character delvelopment was superb in both its detail and simplicity. A touching story, many parts of which are played-out in the personal lives and courtrooms of America today. If this novel has not been optioned for a screenplay, those who do that sort of thing are missing a tremendous opportunity.
B00364K6YW|5.0|The restored edition of Pride and Prejudice is a treasure. I have seldom seen a work in which all the actors have done such magnificent portrayals; however large or small the part. Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle, the two principals, deserve special applause. I think Jane Austen would be quite pleased with her novel brought to life by Sue Birtwhistle. And I shall be pleased to view it many times.
0756405890|4.0|This book is the story of a humble bartender, actually a legendary hero, narrating his tale to a collector of truths.  What makes it interesting is that we first hear the \\"bard's tale\\" version of the man (Kvothe the Dragon-Slayer, Kvothe the Bloodless, etc.), and then, as the tale unfolds, we learn what _really_ happened--which often has Kvothe succeeding only by luck, trickery and wit.    I liked Rothfuss' concept of exploring the difference between Kvothe the legend and Kvothe the orphaned child/awkward teenager--which is what he is throughout the first book.  Despite being extraordinarily gifted at magic and music, he struggles throughout the novel:  dead parents, homelessness, a perpetual lack of money, and a complete and utter lack of confidence with women.  Some reviewers have described Rothfuss (the author himself, not just the character) as being \\"obsessed\\" with money.  Yes, the issue of money does come up a lot in young Kvothe's life, especially while he is at the University, but this is obviously to show how his poverty was a constant problem that he had to overcome (while many of the other students didn't even have to think about it).      I found Kvothe's character, overall, to be very sympathetic.  He is extremely gifted, but his talents often get him into more trouble than they get him out of.  He can be arrogant at times, but given his circumstances, I found his behavior understandable and not generally off-putting.  I think those reviewers who complained that he was \\"too awesome\\" kind of missed the point of the book, which was that there is often a big difference between the legends and the truth!      In terms of writing style, I thought the prose was very smooth--it's not the first thing that jumped to mind when reviewing the book, but it's WAY better than a lot of fantasy books I've read.  I can't quite understand the reviews that say the prose is horrible.  I'm not exactly sure what these reviewers are looking for.  Sure, you could probably findsome lines in the book, which taken out of context might sound a little awkward, but it seems awfully nit-picky.      For all its good points, I must admit that I wasn't as blown-away by the book as I'd hoped.  It came highly recommended to me and perhaps my expectations were somewhat lofty.  The story does get slow for lengthy sections of the book.  I can understand why some people wouldn't care for the emphasis on Kvothe's money problems--maybe for a fantasy book, this hits too close to home?     Also, I found the secondary characters in the book to be weak.  Kvothe's friends at the University are utterly forgettable.  His love interest, Denna, doesn't quite seem special enough to me to warrant his obsession with her.  There is one memorable scene where she sings a duet with him, which made me think she would do more with her music, but later her talents always seem secondary to his (of course, it's told from his point of view, so that may be why!)  I hope her character is developed more fully in the next installment of the series.     All in all, I would definitely recommend this book to people who like intelligently written, character-driven fantasy.  I'm looking forward to reading the next book.

I'll admit. I was intrigued. I thought I knew what I was getting into. I thought, \\"Creature's going to escape from the lab, wreak havoc, and then there will be a chase to capture and kill it.\\"<br /><br />What I got was totally different. I didn't think the last thirty minutes of the movie would end up like it did...and I wasn't ready to see that sh**. I was really disturbed by what happened and I just knew I would never watch this again. And then the twisted scene at the end with the girl and male Dren? Well that was just as messed up as the first time it happened. I just heard myself through my headphones saying, \\"AGAIN?! ARE YOU SERIOUS?\\"<br /><br />What was the point of this movie? Really?<br /><br />Though I cannot lie. It WAS an interesting film to watch. I never got bored and I always wanted to know what happened next. I just hate that what happened next made absolutely no sense whatsoever.<br /><br />Overall, I won't recommend this movie because it is really weird and off the meter. I didn't hate it, but I definitely didn't love it.<br /><br />So different from Cube, which I liked and actually respected.
B000XUBC5E|2.0|I kept thinking this couldn't possibly get any worse, but it does.  The story is filled with simply ridiculous plot twists that come out of nowhere.  If that isn't bad enough the characters are completely unbelievable - a prostitute and drug addict that joins a sorority, a battered wife who receives help to go overseas from a shelter, a dad who is paid $5000 to allow his son to go to prison for a crime he didn't commit, and a ruthless killer with heart of gold.  Don't waste your time on this one.
1594202842|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book and the feedback generated. I am a strict parent. By that I mean, in my home we focus on academics, goal setting, communication skills, and obedience; and then we play. I only have one child, my six year old son. He has amazed me in all the things he is capable of after being introduced to new concepts or skills. His peers are amazed that he can write in cursive, and yet it is old news to us because he could do that in Pre-school. So could your child. Hand your child a pencil beginning at two and half years of age and you will see they can learn to write. By age 4 there is no reason he or she cannot write in cursive. It is a process and the penmanship will be awful for quite some time, but with practice comes excellence.     I would not implement all of the parenting techniques Amy executed, but that is her home and her children; she has the right to raise them as she sees fit. I demand greatness from my child and I recognize he is a child, so I allow (and even encourage) fun and recognizing mistakes. I like that my friends rave about our children's differences. I like my family acknowledging my son doesn't act or communicate like his cousins. I love it when my son corrects or encourages his peers to make good choices even in play.     One point in Amy's book in particular that I absolutely agree with was the third generation paradigm, in which the third generation may lack drive and expect luxury. I can see this factor in my family: my grandfather and grandmother struggled, thus they pushed their children for educational and career success; my mother's generation was able to afford their children the things they never had, to include a more relaxed home environment and less disciplinary actions; my generation became comfortable with our parents gifts and monetary support. I was the exception in my household. I began thinking of supporting myself and preparing for retirement at age 14. I was appalled at my brothers' carefree attitudes andtheir inability to achieve so much more.     My point is-- I loved this book. It was refreshing, reassuring, and it allowed me to look into another family's world and how it benefitted them. I'm not overlooking Amy's daughters hurt, protest, or exhaustion; but again, every family has the right to raise their children as they see fit. Finally, it is just a book. Not a love letter or instructional guide. For those offended, perhaps you gained more appreciation for the parenting methods in your home.

B004L49K20|3.0|I've been a Duran fan since I was 16 and 'Is There Something I Should Know?' was released on the Planet Earth album.  Having said that, what followed the Big Thing album was disappointing.  For me,  Astronaut and Red Carpet were happy reunions with the sound I've always enjoyed now updated for the current times.  I've moved on and so have they.  So in each album, I tend to look for those gems which showcase Simons vocals, Nick's great complex writing and the band's mastery and vibe...  In All You Need Is Now, there's some of that:  Girl Panic (reminiscent of Girls on Film) and All You Need Is Now are catchy and definitely pop.  But the songs that I find myself hauntingly humming are Leave a Light On and Mediterranea.  They are simple and well constructed - beautiful - and show just what DD is capable of.  Other tunes like Blame the Machines are interesting but like early Duran songs they step over the line with sometimes odd lyrics.  Man Who Stole A Leopard certainly has an over-produced Chauffeur flavor, and the lyrics again are just off.  So I listened to posted MP3's and bought selectively via downloads.

0756404738|5.0|I've been anticipating this book since I read the last page of The Name of the Wind in 2007.  The Wise Man's Fear was supposed to be released in 2008 and after finishing it I don't mind that I had to wait three extra years.  The book was spectacular.  The story of Kvothe is interesting and always a surprise.  Rothfuss never relies on the common tropes of the fantasy genre and this series is truly original.

0670022411|5.0|Awesome book!  I thought it got off to a slow start, but after a while I was totally hooked.  The forbidden romance between a witch and a vampire blends nicely with the initial plot about a \\"lost\\" book, so the story isn't all mushy-mushy romance.  In the end, there was definitely room for a sequel and I hope there will be one.

0061989142|4.0|I'm writing this review because I am probably the last person who anyone in the publishing office thought would ever read it and I still found it pretty useful.  For starters, I'm in my mid-thirties, and a stay at home mom of two young boys.  I clearly am not doing any red carpet events.  But, here's why I liked the book.  Like Conrad, I live in Southern California, so some of her casual, cool California style was relatable.  I thought her outfits were good for inspiration, they weren't items I could never see myself or anyone else wearing.  Not too avant garde, not too much couture, etc.  And lastly, the makeup tips where surprisingly good.  I buy almost every fashion/style book that comes out, and still got a few ideas/learned a few things from this one.

0439023521|3.0|I just got a Kindle for my birthday and started loading up on books that were high on the NY Times Bestseller list as well as the Kindle top-sellers.  I guess some lessons have to be learned the hard way - just because it's a top seller doesn't mean it's good.  The description had me enthralled, but there is very little actual violence.  It is in fact a love story cleverly disguised as an action novel.  Brutal it is not.  I kept waiting for an exciting climax, but one never came.  Just the words \\"END OF BOOK ONE\\".<br /><br />To be fair, Suzanne Collins does have a way with words.  Despite my grumblings on plot I found it nearly impossible to put the book down.  The setting was well drawn out and you really did feel like you were \\"there\\".  From District 12, to the Capitol to the Arena where the games were held I felt like I was a spectator to the Hunger Games myself.<br /><br />I just hope book 2 is better! (which I will be purchasing)
0596805888|5.0|Or a great gift for someone that is passionate about cooking.  I'm totally ADD on reading and I actually can read this book because it's divided into highly potent small chunks.  The interviews with industry people are killer.  This is a must have book since its more about teaching you the essentials of \\"how to fish\\" FOR REAL, vs. recipes.  Read this and two other books called Ratio and the Flavor Bible.  A powerful triad geek or not.  If you or someone wants to get deeper and really understand how things work in the food world, these books are invaluable.
B002WY65VU|5.0|Zombieland was the definitive horror themed comedy of 2009 and not only was it surrounded by a LOT of hype on the release date it was able to live up to all expectations AND surpass them. The first real zombie themed comedy since Shaun of the Dead stole the spotlight on horror comedies and what we see in this one is able to surpass it. Directed by relative new director Ruben Fleischer anyone can tell you this is a director to keep your eyes on. It was written by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick who have both worked in a few movies and television. They came together at one point to be a writing team and actually pitched Zombieland as a television show (which is convenient for us seeing a few follow up movies as they have a plot in place to follow through with a few.) With their success on Zombieland they of course are both signed up for a sequel, the Deadpool movie spinoff from Wolverine, and a sequel to the first G.I. Joe film. They are two writers who are going to be huge if they can keep up the momentum in these next three films!<br /><br />We open the movie with an amazing cinematic showing off what has happened to the world being narrated by Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg) as he explains how the world has come to an end. After that he quickly goes over the `rules' he lives by (which is a comedic part that follows through the entire movie) and why he ends up on the move. Soon after beginning his journey to his parent's house he stumbled across Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson.) Tallahassee is a very resourceful if high strung man and one of his quotes says it all, \\"My moma always told me, someday I'd be good at something. Who'd have guessed that something would be zombie killing?\\" This is a fact he has endless fun proving over and over again.<br /><br />While on the search for supplies (and more importantly for Tallahassee, a Twinkie) they come across two other survivors. A pair of sisters who go by Wichita (Emma Stone) and Little Rock (Abigail Breslin) who quickly prove to be much more devious and resourceful than our two leads as they steal Tallahassee's pickup and gun. As they leave our two Tallahassee stumble across a redneck's H2 full of weapons and are on their way again only to end up coming across the pickup now broken down. Clearly a trap they are once again tricked by the two girls but at this point are able to put together a truce because, let's face it the world is covered in the undead and there are more important things to do than worry about each other.<br /><br />The film can be taken as a horror (great gore), comedy (absolutely hilarious at every turn specifically with Harrelson stealing most of the scenes he's in), a romance (Anyone who doesn't see that Columbus and Wichita are going to get together is blind), an action flick (guns guns and guns), and a post apocalyptic film (seriously everything is destroyed) and even with mixing all of these genres together pulls it off. It's one of the funniest and just plain fun films that were released in 2009 and well worth the watch. While the scare factor and suspense aren't that high you still won't regret putting this one on.e much more devious and resourceful than our two leads as they steal Tallahassee's pickup and gun.

B002QW7ALM|4.0|Pandorum was directed by Christian Alvart (who previously directed Case 39) who also co-wrote the story with Travis Milloy. While both of these names are lightweights when it comes to a large history in the film industry Christian's previously reviewed horror film, Case 39, makes a decent argument on why it is worth watching for that reason alone! It's fitting that the film was produced by Paul W.S. Anderson as it has the complete feel of Event Horizon on humanity's turn to evil while out in space.<br /><br />To be honest science fiction horror is what initially got me into horror. Alien is the first movie that completely sold me on the idea of not only watching a horror movie but completely enjoying it. It's slowly become an addiction consuming my life and it's good to know that it all started back in a movie that was marketed to me exactly how Pandorum was - using science fiction.<br /><br />The movie starts as we see Bower (Ben Foster) awaken from cryosleep and apparently has no idea what is going on. Soon after Payton (Dennis Quaid) awakens from the tube next to his and we soon discover that extended use of being put into a forced sleep and frozen tends to eat away at your memories and takes time for them to be restored. We spend the introduction of the movie with the two trapped in a room and there clearly being an issue with the power aboard the ship. Bower uses a ventilation and cable shaft in the ceiling to get out of the room and we soon discover even more of the ship is not what they are expecting.<br /><br />The ship is covered in both traps an what appears to be an alien race that is hunting any humans that are awakened early as pray, think Predator without the cloaking technology. Back in the room Payton is stuck waiting and another crew member, Eden, comes into the room from the same shaft that Bower had left through. While Bower is running for his life trying to avoid the aliens we are given hints at the back story of the ship which roughly translate into Earth being ruined from overpopulation and the ship we are currently watching is an early colonization ship to attempt to colonize a livable planet for mass transport of populations to. At this same time Eden tell us that he is the last member of the previous crew as his two commanding officers ended up suffering from \\"Pandorum\\" (a space madness that manifests itself in the form of paranoia.)<br /><br />While the plot itself keeps it from being as well done as either of the first two Alien movies or Event Horizon it is a fun film to watch. If you are a fan of science fiction being mixed in with your horror you won't be disappointed in this one. You may not enjoy it as much as the films I had just mentioned but with how few truly come out this one goes up as one of the better ones. I do have to say that Dennis Quaid absolutely has to be in more horror films after seeing this one. I don't know if it's the ability to look tense or the voice but he can pull off the creepy factorfrom overpopulation and the ship we are currently watching is an early colonization ship to attempt to colonize a livable planet for mass transport of populations to.

B002VKE1K2|3.0|Paranormal was a smash hit that was first created and shown at fests throughout 2007 but only got it's theatrical release in 2009. Oren Peli both wrote and directed this film which is nothing short of a breakout success with how much attention and money he has made off of it with such an amazingly low production budget. Love it or hate it you have to give Oren credit for being able to create a film that has outdone almost everything out there on the ratio for the profit margin - it honestly wasn't a bad film either.<br /><br />While it's a movie that suffers from being unable to sit through multiple viewings (at least anywhere near each other), being horribly spoiled by audiences knowing what to expect going into it, and many other things that come from a low budget movie's big screen success - it was still a great film. When I sat down for my first screening of the film it actually wasn't prior to a theatrical release and I'm glad I didn't have to watch it as a screener copy though possibly at a convention would have been cool. As I sat down you could feel a buzz going through the audience as it was a showing for all horror fans (about a month before a wide release was announced.) The entire crowd had heard amazing things about it and this was before the marketing machine had crept in and managed to dull the feeling of the film many have missed out on.<br /><br />The entire film consists of 8 characters even though the majority only focuses on the couple Katie (Katie Featherston) and Micah (Micah Sloat.) I love how the majority of the cast has the characters retain the same name as the actors who play them. It's setup to show the couple as being completely realistic and also sets Katie up as having a chance at being a real scream queen if a few casting agents take notice as she really is able to belt it out. As I was saying the couple's interactions for the most part are completely realistic (though Micah's insistence at about the half way mark of the movie to still figure it all out on his own get's a bit tiresome.) People who don't believe in ghosts aren't going to believe that a person can be haunted and try to poke at it to come up with a rational answer which is exactly what Micah does. Katie who knows she is haunted just wants to leave it be as provoking it always makes it worse.<br /><br />The movie has a very slow build up which can hurt it with audiences who have no patience in their movies though the buildup brings up quite a few mind blowing moments of suspense for those who do like a slow start. They are able to capture exactly what makes our cast so afraid of going to bed at night. It's an amazing achievement to be able to get a crowd react so much to purely suspense and not scares in a film and something that is mainly a lost art in Hollywood. Too many people enjoy instant payoffs so the slow buildup has been overlooked for years - Paranormal Activity shows that this is still a valid art form in the realm of making horror.out on his own get's a bit tiresome.)

B004KA9MQO|3.0|I really love Jennifer Hudsons voice. Who couldn't? She has to be the best female vocalist of her generation.  Her debut album had some great stand out tracks on it. I must have played 'If this isn't love' over and over so many times and still play it a lot.     My anticipation for I Remember Me was the same as when Christina came back with 'Stripped'. I thought it'd be a blow them all out of the water album that made her mark as the truly amazing artist I believe her to be.  The voice is there and her talent is obvious but most of the tracks seem to be like another version of 'Where You At' which although is probably the stand out track here, seems to be a weaker version of 'If this isn't love'.  It's hard to tell where one song ends and the other begins a lot of the time as they are all so similar. Lyrically the songs are pretty repetitive and the choruses blend into the verses.    Don't get me wrong, I will continue to listen to this album as vocally you can't fault any of these songs. I just wanted to be as excited listening to it as I was waiting for it to come out. I wasn't. I would be very surprised if there isn't a re-release of this album with some new songs and/or remixes later in the year.
B002KH4KSY|2.0|The film itself was directed by Donald P. Borchers who also ended up taking Stephen King's original short story to adapt into the screenplay that produced this wreck of a film. Children of the Corn is Borcher's third time behind the director's chair but from his first time having worked with horror as he has worked as both crew and producer on a large amount of horror films in the past including a few movies you may have heard of (and loved or hated) such as Leprechaun 2, Highlander 2, The Fog, and a personal favorite of mine - The Howling. Did I mention he was also one of the producers on the original 1984 release?<br /><br />The 2009 release of the classic Stephen King's Children of the Corn should have taken a few queues of the 1984 release that had come before it. This movie trumps almost every other re-make that had come out in 2009 in teaching the lesson of what not to do while re-making a classic horror film. I'm actually shocked it came out as bad as it did with how easy of a concept the film actually has but it seemed that everything they could do to make it wrong was what they went with for the story. With Borchers past experience in the horror genre I really have to question how this film turned out as it did. Even the actors felt underused as the film went out.<br /><br />We open the film with Burton Stanton (an actor you will easily recognize from a slew of television shows) and his wife Vicki (Kandyse McClure of Battlestar Galactica fame) are driving across country and it's this initial scene that blows the movie as Vicki is really just more cruel than necessary and doesn't seem to play the part right. The problem is after Battlestar you know Kandyse has the acting chops she just doesn't seem to come off as believable hateful as she is supposed to be in this film. When the couple finally hit a child in the car and have to find a town they come across a nearly deserted city and find it full of only children with Issac (Preston Bailey who ends up playing Cody on Dexter and Nicholas in the 2010 remake of The Crazies) in charge.<br /><br />For those that don't know the basis of the plot, the children have taken over the city killing all of the adults and using them as sacrifices to a creature that lives in the cornfield whom they worship as a God. The big bonus of being able to see what is ruling these children's lives never happens as there is no payoff that shows what it is and the ending felt both rushed and unnatural with how Burton falls into having flashbacks that overlay the horror he is experiencing.<br /><br />ScyFy has put together some impressive re-makes in the past. Their production value on the Dune (yes I know not horror) miniseries comes to mind. However I will quickly admit that all I am doing right now is looking forward to the Dimension Films re-make that will be coming out in the near future to wipe this abomination out of my memory. With being involved in the original release of this film I don't quite know how Borchers was able to steer this in such a wrongand Nicholas in the 2010 remake of The Crazies) in charge.

B002QOB796|3.0|To sing the way he did on this album Billy Gibbons swallowed a frog and put a peg on his nose. He then proceeded to boast about all the sex he's paid for out of the corner of his mouth as if it were some great accomplishment.<br /><br />But this whole nasally fake bluesman facade wears thin by the end of the album. However there's enough good rock music (and nasty guitar playing) on here to justify a pass mark. 2 1/2 is about right, but worth rounding up to 3 if need be.
B003EYVXSW|4.0|Splice is a little gem from 2009 that is a great view of horror that is created purely by science. Yes that's right it's a science fiction and horror mash up which, when done well, is my favorite mixture of genre's. It's mainly a fun mix as a lot of what is focused on in science fiction is actually based in reality when it comes to being mixed with horror. While not a house hold name this is actually Vincenzo Natali's second foray into a film that mixes the two genres and as his last 1997 film that mixed the two, Cube, became a cult hit I have the distinct feeling that Splice will follow the same trend.<br /><br />Gene splicing is not a new concept. It's a field that has been worked on for years and one that new breakthroughs are still occurring. Mixing genes to find ways to grow human organs is also not a new concept and the mixing of genes to create a new species has been written about for years. On the face of things, scientifically most of what is found is this film is not new. The creation of 'new' life by two scientists who aren't fully held in check by the company that they work for and who have their own ideas on how science should be done leads to a border line mad science feel mixed with the idea that what they are doing is right. Well that is at least the view that Elsa (Sarah Polley) believes and as her research partner partner, Clive (Adrien Brody,) is also her lover he will pretty much go along with anything she says.<br /><br />What this leads to is not only a new species of life but one that has a mixture of human DNA in it. They of course cannot let the company that they work for know about their creation so have it hidden away in a corner of the lab. However when the creature they have created is fully 'born' they end up taking it out of the laboratory so as to not have it be found. It continues to grow into at first a child at the abandoned house Elsa grew up in and eventually into a young 'woman' that is self aware who they have named Dren (Delphine Chaneac.)<br /><br />Self awareness is great but just like in an artificial intelligence it's a bad thing to have in a new species who not only wants to be able to be free but also starts to fall in love with Clive while beginning to resent Elsa. From science to the Oedipus complex to horror as Dren starts to at first be angry with Elsa to beginning to fight with her as she also falls in love with Clive. While all of this is happening we learn that the first two creatures they had created have gone from being in love to violently murdering each other. Foreshadowing? I think so! If you are a fan of mixing your horror and science I'd suggest at the very least renting this one immediately. I know it's going to be permanently added to my collection.Self awareness is great but just like in an artificial intelligence it's a bad thing to have in a new species who not only wants to be able to be free but also starts to fall in love with Clive while beginning to resent Elsa.

B004EC5IUW|5.0|I have been waiting for this movie forever, and it did not disappoint in the least. I was most eager to hear Tiffany Grant reprise her role as Asuka as I am a big fan, and that alone was worth it. But the movie as a whole was so far beyond what I expected (and I expected a lot, I mean c'mon, its EVANGELION!). The visual effects are excellent, and the story line was brilliant.  Though a little hesitant at first, I quickly warmed up to the new character, Mari, played very well in English by Trina Nishimura (I have yet to watch the Japanese sub). Sorry Trina, you did very well, but Asuka is still my fav ^_^. The character developments were very fresh as well. I was very happy that Shinji manned up in this one. His actions were justified and I actually wanted to root for him. Asuka was Asuka just as I'd hoped, yet she seems slightly more emotional than the original series, which gave her a slightly more ambiguous and somewhat new persona. And lastly, Rei acutally smiles more than once! I know, I cant believe it myself.   All in all, one of the greatest movies, not just animes, Ive ever seen. It jerked every nerve. I laughed, I cried, I was left speechless. The last time that happened was during The End Of Evangelion.   An instant classic, worth watching. Bring on number 3!!!

That is until I took my Daughter to see tangled. Instantly I knew Disney had a hit on their hands and they returned to their roots. My Daughter absolutely loved. She wanted it on DVD the next. We of course got it the day it came out and she watches it 3 times a day. One of the all time greats.

B0041KKYEM|5.0|I've been an Aronofsky fan since I first saw PI, so this review comes from an admittedly biased source.  Still, I think anyone seeing this film can't help but be drawn into its dark story line, strong characters, and exceptional performances.  The special effects, although minimal by Aranofsky standards, were seamless and never over the top.  Portman , as the emotionally stunted, aspiring prima ballerina, displays a remarkably broad emotional pallete. From the insecure, self abusing scratcher, to the fantasizing bisexual temptress, and finally to the near-psycopathic surreal dance queen, Portman never disappoints.  If her dancing wasn't perfect (or not even her own, is irrelevant .. its a movie, not real life!), it was certainly good enough to maintain the illusion.  Vincent Cassel was both creepy and believable as the head of the ballet.  Mila Kunis' hedonistic portrayal as the quintessential black swan and corrupting influence on Nina completely made me forget about her sickly sweet \\"That Seventies Show\\" work.  She was hot, sexy, and believable.  Barbara Hershey turned in a good performance as the doting mother, although it was probably the weakest performance of the principles.  The downward spiral of Nena was nearly as good as Burstyn's in \\"Requiem\\".  Aranofsky seems to have a way of capturing emotional collapse better than anyone.
B000002UVX|5.0|I never knew a live album would be this perfect. Jimi Hendrix, Billy Cox, and Buddy Miles have done wonders with this one. The songs are excellent (my personal favorite being \\"Machine Gun\\"), most of which showcase Hendrix's spectacular guitar playing. And...what else can I say? The lyrics are deep, the music is awe-inspiring, and the sound quality for a live recording is pretty neat. I don't think I have enough words to express how much Band of Gypsys remains at the top. This is genuine music right here, ladies and gentlemen. Vintage Hendrix. Vintage rock and blues.

B00007LTIA|5.0|\\"Tales from Topographic Oceans\\" is a fantastic album, and one which I recommend wholeheartedly. You've probably heard about \\"Tales\\"' epic scope, the way themes both lyrical and musical are used to tie the entire work together, and so on. All this is true, but it is not why I recommend \\"Tales\\". I recommend it because it contains some of the most beautiful moments in the history of recorded music.<br /><br />Most of this album is good. But even if it were almost all irredeemable dreck, it would be worth buying this album just to hear the opening theme of \\"Revealing Science of God\\", the final interlude in \\"The Remembering\\", Steve Howe's guitar in \\"The Ancient\\", or the lengthy vocal section in \\"Ritual\\".<br /><br />\\"Tales\\" is a deep and challenging work. And if you prefer Sufjan Stevens, the Arcade Fire, or Fleet Foxes, I don't blame you. But it would be a shame to fill your music collection with nothing but acoustic verse-chorus-verse numbers or head-banging walls of sound, while passing over one of the most unique albums ever recorded.

B001O7SMRG|5.0|I cannot imagine who would not like this album.    Crosby, Stills, and Nash is that rare creature - a work which combines instant appeal with lasting significance. From the beginning of the album opener \\"Judy Blue Eyes\\", the listener is enthralled by CSN's upbeat melodies and thick vocal harmonies. But this album is much more than just a Beatlesesque romp - most of the songs also feature unusual chords and tunings as well as thoughtful lyrics. \\"Long Time Gone\\" is immediately listenable as a spacey rock song - as a commentary on the RFK assassination, it is an essential piece of Americana. Likewise with \\"Wooden Ships\\", which captures the fear of nuclear war.    If you can, try to get the version with four bonus tracks. All, or almost all, of them are of the same level of quality as the songs released on the original album.
B002ZG98J6|5.0|I picked up this movie simply because I just purchased a new tv and was excited to try out the blue ray.  Well, the film is every bit as entertaining as any of the super hero films.  Of course, this one is based on greek mythology but with a very good modern twist.  My girlfriend and I both thought it was excellent and entertaining.  Definately worth a purchase and looks amazing on blu-ray.  It will even increase your interest in Greek mythology.
B001PO53IO|5.0|This is the first item I have felt compelled to right a review about.<br /><br />Now I am an almost 21 year old, female, college student.  I have always loved Star Wars and it has been a part of my family's life for many years.  I am not hard to please, in that I can watch a lot and be happy, but I do not give credit when credit is not deserved.  I saw with the most sincerity that this show (as of Season 2's release) is amazing and does nothing but continue to impress and astound me.<br /><br />The animation, incredibly rich. The storyline, deeply gripping.  The character development, amazingly composed.  This show gives you a deeper an more personal look at, not just the main characters but the entire Star Wars universe, making the tragedy that was Anakin Skywalkers ascension to the Dark side.  The voice actors do an amazing job of sounding bot unique and similar to the actors in the live movies.  In some ways, you almost like the portrayal of the characters better in the animation then in the live action because of how much further it pushes the Star Wars universe.  At times you forget you are NOT watching the live action, because the animation in this show is just that good.<br /><br />This animated series also leaves us with many new questions, (like that of Ahsoka's death, because we all know she is going to die) that create a new understanding of many of the characters and the entire Star Wars universe.  This show should not be missed, especially if you consider yourself a Star Wars fan. ;)
0757302661|4.0|I thought this was a great book... gave all the background on the concept of Hypno-birthing and details on techniques.  However, each book should contain a CD on the back and this book was missing the CD!!!  BE CAREFUL if you want to get this book.  It should contain an audio CD.
B001EN71DQ|4.0|The only issue I take with this product is the fault of those writing and directing the film (So Lucas then?) the DVDs themselves arrived and worked fine. I will refrain from going into a long tirade on the flawed or missing plots, poorly developed characters, and over-reliance on computer effects in nearly every scene of these movies. If you want to hear all of that (with gratuitous humor thrown in) I would suggest the reviews on RedLetterMedia.com. Its out of the ordinary, but nearly every thing he says about the SW movies is valid.    If you are a person who hasn't seen Star Wars, I would strongly suggest you watch the original trilogy first.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|This is the only reason I got the amazon appstore. So I could get this app. This should always be free, not worth the paid free app a day.
B002ZG981E|5.0|I will make this simple for you. If you think American Idol is good programming, If you give a damn who Snooki is or if you think Stephanie Myers is talented this is NOT for you. In other words, I suggest you have a brain to really enjoy this as well as an open mind and a lean towards Sci-fi couldn't hurt either. Nolan uses great visuals and techniques to tell a multi-layered story set in the world of dream-espionage. As someone who despises Leo I still managed to love the movie despite him. This movie could be difficult to follow if your not used to using your brain while be entertained but people who read for enjoyment or are used to sci-fi worlds should be able to enjoy this without spraining your brain.        While their are some very forgivable flaws it was clearly one of the best movies of the year. Those who say it is not original are really looking for an excuse to attack the movie. In a world where Hollywood has done everything twice and every movie you see is a remake or blatant rip-off of something else this is as close to original as I've seen I've seen in a long while.
B003QNXPUK|2.0|I'll keep this short and simple. It's just something that takes away from the iPhone 4. I have no doubt the material is EXTREMELY strong. I bought one the day I got my iPhone, and AT&T installed it for me. Figured I could handle it, but it was free to let them, so why not? They had to try 4 times, and it never went on right. Always bubbled, and seemed very cloudy. Decided instead of taking it back in and letting them try a 5th time, I'd order one for myself and just do it at home. I had read what a nightmare these things are to install, and if very experienced people had to try 4+ times to get it right (never doing so) it must be a pretty tough beast. But despite reading all about it, I tried anyway. I actually got it on fairly well! but it was again, VERY cloudy. Zagg said it would clear up within a few days time, it just got worse. Until one day, it was almost solid white and couldn't even read my screen.     Took it off, bought a 5 dollar protector that went on (and fit MUCH better) very quickly, no bubbles, no cloudy film, no orange peel texture, glass smooth. Now, this material REALLY is very strong. After I took it off, since they obviously have a hard time cutting them to fit the iPhone 4 properly, can't seem to get even one (out of 5!!!!!!!!!) to be applicable without a cloudy film underneath, I wondered if the material was even as strong as they said. Took some serious effort to stab through it, and where I purposefully scratched it (after removal!!) with my keys, the material quickly filled those scratches. Amazing stuff, just wish it didn't look so bad installed! Maybe they'll nail it after a few more years. (I know I seem like I'm bashing the product. But seriously... 2 different techs, 4 different times, and then myself, myself being the only one that even got it to fit reasonably and without bubbles, and then a few days later it still ****ed up itself... It's just unnecessarily difficult when a 5 dollar one went right on, is much clearer and more smooth. This may stand up to nuts and bolts, pocket knives, and keys, but what the hell good is that when it ruins such a beautiful display? )    Two stars because it is actually extremely tough. But only two since it's such a nightmare, and doesn't really even fit the phone. Even aligned \\"properly\\" there is a great deal of unprotected space along the edges, around the home button, the cameras, and along the sides. And lets not forget the cloudy film it creates between itself and the display of the iPhone.
B0041KKYEW|3.0|The incredible amount of hype about this movie means that most of us will inevitably see it just to see what's going on and that's exactly why I did.        To simplify the movie is very average and even a bit boring. I've heard the view that if you don't like it you don't get it, but I far from agree. It's nearly impossible not to get it and that's the real problem, it's so heavy handed and obvious that your exhausted from being beat over the head with the obvious symbolism, which is one of the two major flaws this movie has along with it's ability to bore you for stretches.         Natalie Portman is very good, and I enjoyed Mila Kunis as well, acting is definitely not the problem here which is why I gave it 3 stars. This is obviously a film aimed more towards woman, VERY obvious and don't let anyone tell you different even the scenes of sexuality seemed to be aimed towards a woman's sensibilities so in the end I suppose it wasn't meant for me.        To bottom line it for you the symbolism of the Swan Queen (Black swan/White swan) and the story that is being told would have benefited from the saying less is more, it was way too obvious what the movie was trying to say and leading to in the end. The movie was very boring for stretches and seemed to be aimed at women to the exclusion of men completely right down to the fact that there is only one male character in the movie and his role is also obvious. Lastly the acting was very good, and I wouldn't expect less from Ms Portman or Mila Kunis. If you plan on seeing it don't go in with high expectations or you will be sorely disappointed.

B001EN71CW|5.0|When people ask about my favorite TV shows this is always my first mention. Firefly succeeds on so may levels that it is hard to define why it's great. I believe much of it has to do with the fact that the entire cast has talked about how much they loved doing this show together and it really shows.        Firefly was a true ensemble piece that was driven by amazing characters and brilliant writing. They were characters, and settings that almost felt familiar but were unique enough to make you pay attention. It was Sci-fi for everyone not just \\"geeks\\" and \\"nerds\\". It was Sci-fi about people trying to survive and stay together, humans with flaws and potential and baggage trying to leave their past and work together to survive in a universe they don't quite fit into. No aliens, no time travel, just people, and still a deal of action.         Most people know the story of how Fox TV screwed with this show in every way possible before finding an excuse to cancel it, and for this and other reasons Fox has vilified itself to a great many people. Despite Fox's shortsightedness Firefly has a fan base that is still growing as new people discover it. In just 14 episodes Firefly managed to do what most shows will never do, grab you and never let go. The true reason to mourn it's loss is potential. You have to wonder if in just 14 episodes it could be this great what could have happened if it had built a mythology and its character's had followed their natural growth.        Their are groups still trying to get it back on the air or even a sequel to it's big screen finale \\"Serenity\\" made but sadly this will probably never happen but if anyone out there in the verse can ask Joss Whedon one thing, just one favor, ask him to at least let the universe be continued in novels, it has great potential to be a hit in the literary world especially since Firefly and Serenity's demographic is definitely one that reads.

B002TVQ4HG|4.0|If you like movies like [[ASIN:B0007N1JC8 Primer]] and the Spanish film [[ASIN:B001FOPOD8 TimeCrimes]], then you will enjoy the time paradoxes in \\"Triangle.\\"<br /><br />Unlike [[ASIN:B001FOPOD8 TimeCrimes]], the protagonist in this film seems to remember each time loop, and is able to change events in each iteration, so you get the idea that, given enough trips through the loop, she will eventually achieve her goal (although at the end, she seems to be making the same mistakes and forgetting everything she has learned).<br /><br />Also compared to the two other time paradox films listed above, this one seems to make the most sense, and the character motivations seem the most straightforward (even without the scientific mumbo-jumbo of [[ASIN:B0007N1JC8 Primer]] and [[ASIN:B001FOPOD8 TimeCrimes]]).
0316098337|4.0|Jack is the 5 year old that the book follows. The author does a GREAT job making you believe that this is written from the perspective of a 5 year old. It takes a little bit to adjust your reading pattern to fit the way that Jack speaks and even thinks, there were times when I had to reread something but once you are in it's like reading any other book. Exploring Jack's expanding world its the books strongest aspect of the book, beautiful even. The draw back for me is the lack of excitement or thrill considering its a story of a woman who was abducted and held captive for 7 years. But even with that said I'm glad I took the time to read Jack's story...

B004G6009K|5.0|I am so glad I bought the extended version. The deleted scenes are great and the extended scenes are funny. My kids love watching them I don't know why they left them out. Kids love this movie so much they just want more. I love that I get 4 disks! My kids will eventually scratch up the one disk I will give them but I will have copies! The movie is just amazing! The animation is unreal, how did they get the hair to look so real. This really was completely worth the money.
B001QOGYBI|4.0|I viewed the film for the first time last Christmas with FOUR generations of family members. I had never been aware of the film  and had to ask my niece,who has two sons, four and eight years old, what the film was, as I came in just after it started. I thought I'd  sit a while and check it out. I checked it out until the end. My niece said it was one of the only films her kids stay put and watch 'til the end.  Nice thing to have around the holidaze! Along with the kids, their parents, the parent's parents and their parents, plus me and few others, all   thoroughly enjoyed this very interesting tale of a fox and the chickens and the farmers and characters who make up this very entertaining film.  Sure, a lot of the music fit right into my generation, which I found to be very fun and seemed to fit right in with the story. It's a film that I  think sits on a fence by itself, clucking at anyone going by to stop and watch. And if you are a fox, maybe stir up some dust and have a quick snack!
B001MYIXAC|1.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />It doesn't astound me at all that the majority of mainstream film critics gave \\"Let the Right One In\\" a free pass! They have been suckered in by so many pretentious 'art' films these days, why can't an ordinary horror film be included in their pantheon? The critics' level of self-deception is so high on this film that there were zero negative reviews, only one mixed and 29 positive reviews on Metacritic (the mixed one was by Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly; unfortunately, it's only a capsule blurb).<br /><br />For the majority of internet posters with dissenting opinions, their main objection was that the film was too slow-paced to be worthwhile. There are plenty of films that are slow-paced but they still hit the mark, so to criticize the film merely on the grounds that it's tedious, misses the point as to why 'The Right One' is so reprehensible.<br /><br />It begins in a Stockholm suburb and it looks like this is going to be another tired serial killer retread. The killer (Hakan) has slit the throat of a young man walking in a park, hangs him upside down, dangling from a tree, and then attempts to collect the blood into a gasoline can as it drips from the victim's neck. Soon, however, we learn that Hakan is actually a vampire (or rather an assistant to a vampire who appears to be 12 years old). The 12 year old 'female', named Eli, actually has been alive since the middle ages (the book that the film is based on includes more graphic details on Eli's origins--that she, rather he, was castrated by a sadistic vampire nobleman).<br /><br />Some critics (such as Roger Ebert) became enamored with the relationship angle between Oskar, the lonely 12 year old protagonist, and his new found vampire friend. Oskar already has a fascination with crime to begin with, cutting out articles from the local newspapers detailing sordid murders occurring in nearby localities. While Oskar seems to have a nose for crime, the local police in 'Let the Right One In\\" seem to be oddly absent during the investigation into the killings initiated by Hakan and his juvenile master, Eli.<br /><br />One wonders why Eli suddenly takes a liking to little Oskar since she has no guilt feelings about draining the blood out of various other upstanding members of the community. Since those community members all seem to depicted as a bunch of louts or buffoons, I guess it's okay that Hakan and Eli can do whatever they want to them with impunity. Eli further displays her 'sensitive side' when she advises Oskar to strike back at the local bullies who have been harassing him.<br /><br />There are very few films that will feature a murderous monster who is depicted as not being so bad after all. Somehow it doesn't bother Oskar that his gal pal goes around dispatching whoever she feels like it. Not only is Oskar's acquiescence condoned, but the film's scenarists have no guilt feelings about promoting the idea that it's good for a 12 year old to take the law into his own hands. Even worse is the idea that it's okay for a boy who's been bullied, to take revenge, acting just as sadistically as his tormentors did toward him (Recall how Oskar takes delight in whipping the school bully across the face with a pole).<br /><br />I suppose the reason why Eli is supposed to get a free pass here is because somehow she can't help herself (after all, she got bitten back in the Middle Ages). The moral of the story is that you can commit all the horrific murders you want but as long as you counsel a 12 year old boy as to the proper etiquette in dealing with a group of stick figure, cardboard cut out bullies, then you can continue traipsing around Scandinavia, committing additional atrocious crimes.<br /><br />As for those of you still looking for true scenes of horror, 'The Right One' offers only slim pickings. In addition to the aforementioned opening scene where Hakan does his blood draining bit, you also get (hold on to yourseats!): Eli (channeling Spiderman) scurrying up the side of a hospital building, Hakan disfiguring himself by pouring hydrochloric acid over his face, in order to escape being identified by the police and Eli returning to rip off the heads and arms of the school bullies who are about to make mince meat of Oskar at the school swimming pool.<br /><br />Nothing really makes sense in 'Let the Right Thing In' including the blood sucking vampires and morally challenged 12 year olds. One can't really blame John Lindqvist, author of the book the film was based on, as well as its screenwriter, for the ultimate successful promotion of this claptrap. That honor goes to the film critics, always seeking their next great 'work of art' along with the teenage audience that went to the movie theaters in droves and (unfortunately) bought all those tickets.hospital building, Hakan disfiguring himself by pouring hydrochloric acid over his face, in order to escape being identified by the police and Eli returning to rip off the heads and arms of the school bullies who are about to make mince meat of Oskar at the school swimming pool.

B004U8VWLE|5.0|Well, I wasn't able to watch this movie in the theatre but knew I wanted to rent it. I knew the movie had won a lot of awards but I had also heard it was a huge lesbian fest, which is ok, but I just wasn't sure what I was going to be watching. This movie was better than I could have imagined and I will definitely be buying the dvd for my collection. I loved how the movie had a bit of an indy feel, like how the camera would follow behind her in scenes, like documentary style....but it still kept a main stream quality that was easy to enjoy. The story line was great from her ballet career, odd relationship with her mother, and intense pressures of her new role as Swan Queen. They called this a psycological thriller and it lived up to the title! Most movies are easy to predict but this one kept me guessing till the end. There are some sexual tones throughout the movie but it made the movie sexy and a little dangerous feeling, it was exhilirating. The final dance at the end....WOW!!! I actually gave a standing ovation in my own living room. lol. Rent it, rent it, rent it....  :)
B001EOQWFI|2.0|Blu ray was in great shape. Very disappointed overall because I wanted the digital copy.  It was missing the code for the digital copy.  You cannot get a new code unless you have the original receipt.  I feel this was wrong to advertise this blu ray as having a digital copy.

B003GEDLW6|5.0|Having been a fan of Hold Your Colour and In Silico, I picked up Immersion with high hopes. Immersion not only exceeded those hopes, it smashed through them like a 2 ton punch to the face.     Having heard them change their style from HYC to InSil, they decided to try and make it as hard as possible for anyone to put them in a single classification of electronic music. Seriously, this album has styles ranging from 8-bit chip tunes, drum and bass, dubstep, house, breaks, industrial, and even a bit of metal thrown in for good measure, all with the instantly recognizable Pendulum flavor. It's as if in the studio someone asked \\"Well, what genre do we want to do for this album?\\" and the response was \\"All of them.\\" This ability to move between so many genres with such tonal success speaks volumes to Pendulum's talent.    This is now in heavy rotation on anything that I own that will play music. I greatly recommend buying this album if you are a pendulum fan or just a music lover in general.

0764169742|5.0|Unfortunately, as with all \\"How to ...!\\" books, this one has a couple pages of instructions and the rest, again as usual, is a \\"Look how good I am!\\" book.  The author does do beautiful work, or I suppose someone else would have written the book?     Perhaps the basics are really so simple all it takes is  hours and hours, plus years and years of practice?  Assuming also that somewhere along the line you showed some aptitude and artistic talent.  After three quarters of a century I have failed in both respects.  Being aware of this, this is not why I chose to attempt drawing; sticking to black and white because there is always a pencil available somewhere and a piece of paper of some sort.  No closet full of dried up paint tubes for me!       This was for the very practical purpose of seeing more of what I was looking at and in that manner actually getting more out of life.  It has worked admirably.  You should try it!  You will be amazed at how much you don't see when you just look.     As the author points our, we as humans are not very adept at spotting colors.  We think we are picking out a matching color for instance and when we get home and compare it, it isn't even close.  Well, I figured I would just give it a try, put a little color in my life - and so I shall.  I'll at least give it a try and not be put off by the fact that my renditions don't come close to the beautiful illustrations in the book.  Perhaps I'll just have a better understanding and appreciation of how she got them that way.  That's enough for this life time.
B0013N3DSE|5.0|What can I say? I ordered the movie for next to nothing and it arrived at my house in a matter of days in a brand new condition. I ask for nothing more or less when I order from the marketplace. Thanks for the movie and keep up the good work.

B004NCZ5QK|5.0|Written by Mrs Allison:    It's not as much an adventure story or novel as it is a wonderful review of marriage and relationships between women, men and women and amongst men and women throughout history, and the world.  The cultures Gilbert's been fortunate enough to experience are wonderfully detailed with interesting, if not controversial, commentary.  For anyone in a relationship, it's worth reading this sociological masterpiece.
B002ZG98Z0|2.0|I'll start off by saying I am a huge fan of the series..if it's on the tv while I'm doing dishes, chores, or need background noise...I'll watch/listen to it.  I did enjoy the first movie, a lot.  But please..if the second movie is any indication of how these characters develop...then please just STOP.      I knew right from the beginning that I was not going to like this movie.  The wedding at the beginning of the movie was so far fetched and ridiculous..and it didn't end there.  Dear Samantha: There is so much more to life than sex.  I would have hoped you could've learned that by now.  The fact that the writers have NO idea how to make Samantha grow as a person is pitiful.  And who in their right mind sits in their office with clear windows with their panties around their ankles to put cream on their bajingo?  It just.  doesn't.  happen.  In fact, \\"That would NEVER happen\\" ran through my mind about a million times throughout this movie.      I am aware it's \\"just a movie\\" but it's not a fantasy, and wasn't billed as one--I love the Harry Potter films, but I KNOW that is fantasy.  How many people can just up and leave for Abu Dhabi and have an all expenses paid trip with a personal butler, a private car, and a fantastical suite..with three of their best friends?  Didn't think so.    This movie missed the mark on so many levels, I was really disappointed.

B00386EZJU|5.0|Have to admit that upon seeing the movie I experienced something similar to what I felt when I heard John Williams soundtrack to the Empire Strikes Back.  Its an, epiphany sort of thing.  Just as John Williams found inspiration from many sources just so has John Powell. By no means is this a negative statement.  John Powell found some wonderful inspiration from Ralph Vaughn Williams.  He finds wonderful inspiration from one of the most sublime pieces I've ever heard.  Ralph Vaugh Williams Lark Ascending.  Check it out, you wont be disappointed.  [...]  He also found some great contrasts from Hector Berlioz, the odd placements made sense, just as Berlioz's did. For an example check out Berlioz's Romeo and Juliette.  [...]  Then the fact he wove so much of it together so well.  Excellent soundtrack.  Its a spiders web, you take the wool your given so you can make something thats yarn, be your tapestry.

B004SGWYW4|4.0|By now we're all well aware of and are probably active participants in the media zombie pandemic.  What began with classic horror films has spawned countless novels, comics, television, comedies, video games, and everything else you can see or hear, infecting pop culture with the undead virus.  But I have been wondering something for quite some time now:  when will anime represent for the walking dead?  Well, that question has been answered, fellow animation fanatics.  Highschool of the Dead is here and delivering the thrills of classic Romero and the coolness of The Walking Dead, while utilizing the full spectrum of the anime genre to make this zombie apocalypse stand out as it's own animal.  And it is so close to perfectly awesome it hurts.<br /><br />Before I whine about the show's failing, let me fill you in on the good.  There's lots of it.  Right from the get-go Highschool of the Dead gets your heart racing with pure horror and some of the coolest action sequences ever animated.  As the sudden invasion quickly spreads through the halls of the high school, we are introduced to the individuals who will become our heroes.  While most students panic and quickly become prey to the ever-increasing host of ghouls, a few individuals pull it together and improvise means to fight back.  The otaku gun nut.  The kendo princess.  The ordinary kid whose best is brought out by extraordinary circumstances.  The haughty intellectual.  The airheaded school nurse. Over the first two episodes, these people will coalesce into a force to be reckoned with.  The show does an admirable job of remaining character-based and developing the relationships between it's survivors well after the extremely hectic initial outbreak, and as far as opening salvos go in survival horror, this show takes the damn cake for sure.  The art and animation are top-notch, the characters are instantly memorable, and also it's zombies!  And anime!  Sugoi, neh?<br /><br />Okay, time for some of that old-time tough love.  This show is one of the most exciting and cool anime series I've come across in a good while, and it ticks almost all of my boxes for a great zombie story, but on one front it really blows it. Rant mode: engaged.  I'm writing this paragraph as an introduction speech to present Highschool of the Dead with the first annual Najica Blitz Tactics Award for Achievement in Moronic Fanservice.  Hold your applause.  This is not a good thing.  God, this show could even teach Najica a thing or two.  It's frankly embarrassing.  I'm a big fan of sexuality in entertainment, but only when it is portrayed in a realistic and adult manner or at least matches the tone of the story.  But in a show where high school students are seeing their teachers and classmates being torn apart only to rise again and attack them in turn, having a character with ridiculously enormous breasts that make boingy noises and fly all over the place independently of each other every time she so much as blinks around is not only distracting, it literally brings the entire show down a notch.  I can deal with the pantyshots in every scene, but the incessant focus on the female characters' boobs makes this show infuriating.  At one point we get a bullet's-eye-view shot as one girl's breasts use a scissor motion to dodge said bullet.  And the bullet was fired from a rifle using another girl's breasts as a bipod (they slosh in slow motion with each shot fired).  Jesus God, WHY?!  Everything else about this show is so good!  The immaturity shown in HotD's use of fanservice is probably the most atrocious thing I've ever seen in terms of bringing down an otherwise amazing production.  Honestly, I'd be tempted to knock off another half star or so from the rating if the first season's second half didn't tone it down so much.  Be warned.<br /><br />[sighs] Glad to get that off my chest.  Okay, the good of HotD far outweighs the idiotic breast and panty fixation in an otherwise great show.  In fact, this would be instantly pushing for a spot on my favorite anime ever list if the childish sexuality had been presented in a more mature manner or omitted altogether.  If you love zombies and anime, this is a must-see.  This is brought to us by the same man who gave us the Death Note and Black Lagoon animes, after all. Each ep has a post-credits sequence that is often important to the story which makes the show feel even more theatrical than it already is and I like that the ending theme changes as well.  A mere 12 episodes is far too short a season for a show like this, and once you see the nod to Romero that is the final shot of the first season, I suspect you will be as excited as I am for the next chapter in the saga.  If they keep the fanservice manageable from here on out, we may just have a classic on our hands.ng for a spot on my favorite anime ever list if the childish sexuality had been presented in a more mature manner or omitted altogether.

A mere 12 episodes is far too short a season for a show like this, and once you see the nod to Romero that is the final shot of the first season, I suspect you will be as excited as I am for the next chapter in the saga.  If they keep the fanservice manageable from here on out, we may just have a classic on our hands.
B0041KKYBA|4.0|Very interesting; very infruriating. A little repetitive at times.  Obviously produced with a point of view in mind which is not countered because so many participants declined to be interviewed.  But, overall, very good.
B000BB14YY|5.0|Words cannot describe the excellent service I received. I was very wary, as this would be my first purchase from Amazon, and I don't tend to order items from strangers. But this gentleman infused confidence. Not only did I receive my order earlier than expected, it was exactly in the condition he advertised (i.e. - like new), with everything functioning normally. I whole-heartedly recommend buying from this gentleman.
0061765236|5.0|Excellent read! I must admit at first I wasn't fond of switching back and forth between two perspectives, but at the end I realized why. It was an amazing story that I can't stop thinking about. This book stays with you and you can't put it down! Similar to another reviewer, I took it everywhere with me for days...it will take over your life! Must read...
159562015X|5.0|We are a small family business with more family members becoming involved, and as such thought it would be prudent to do some team building and learn more about each other so as to avoid unnecessary conflict, promote good work understandings etc.  We have a total of 7 people doing this.<br />For a start we only had one book- so did it a bit differently.<br />We first went through the book and assessed ourselves privately, and then went through as a group and assessed each person.  We then correlated the strongest 5 characteristics (personal and group opinion) of each person and discussed the implications to our key relationships.<br />We have since ordered books for each person, but haven't yet completed the online questionnaire- something we will be very interested in...  This gave us a great structure for our DIY weekend of team building and is a great tool for small companies not wanting to invest huge money into such things, but wanting a comprehensive and worthwhile experience.  Cheers!
B000QUUD60|5.0|This DVD is superb and shows Elvis as he really is, full of energy and without the cliche \\"Thank you very Much\\" Elvis gives it his all in this video as usual.<br />All the Elvis imitators couldn't even begin to keep up with his energy and personality. This is definitely Elvis at his best.
B00127RAJY|5.0|The thing about any exercise program is that a healthy diet MUST be part of it... Diet plays more of a role in weight than exercise, hence the reason it is easier to lose weight by solely dieting than solely exercising.  So sometimes I wonder if the hit or miss reviews have more to do with that  I decided I would cut down by carb intake to 50-70g/day and use this DVD 3-4 times/week.  I am an avid runner and normally have a gym membership (but in an attempt to cut down on gym costs I thought I'd try this).  When I started I was 5'4 and 132lbs.  Normally, I am about 120lbs but gained weight during interview season for residency... I lost ALL of the weigt I gained within 3 weeks and then some!  My fiance is also trying to lose weight for our wedding and just goes to the gym, he wants to try these now that he has seen my results! I have not been this thin since high school, it's incredible!  But again, I think the trick is to be serious about your diet.  These DVDs are challenging, even for someone very fit! Squat and press still makes me want to cry...  Good luck to all the ladies trying this workout routine!
B0042RJWTC|4.0|I bought The Tudors  collection on Amazon as a treat to myself and it was well worth the $100 odd bucks I paid  for it, it's pure entertainment and nothing like what I was taught in School (it's definitely a grownup version).  The cast and the  the costumes are fantastic as are the scenery shots. The executions are pretty grusome as are the battle scenes and thats fine, it was a grusome era.  Two gripes however,  a couple of the discs stuck halfway though and two or three discs had trailers for new movies added on  which I suppose doesn't matter to some people but I hate it.  The collection is beautifuly  boxed and would make a great gift.

B0041KKYDI|2.0|Much of the story never gets told.  The book provides the details that make the story much more real.  The movie also adds some parts to the story line that just didn't happen.  After you read the book you'll realize how poorly the movie captures the essence of Ralston's adventures.
B0035J6TA8|3.0|Many water has flowed under the bridge since I listened \\"Solsbury Hill\\". Peter Gabriel gives us an album covering pop songs, some of them unknown to the prog fans. At the first listening, the album seems too dark, with no drums and guitars. This is is the first part of a project where every artist covered on this album is being asked to cover one of Peter Gabriel's songs in exchange. With excelent strings performance, Gabriel's voice captivates us, even with the lack of drums and guitars. Some songs sound brilliant, but some too loose. Certainly this is not his best album.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|This hsf works awesome!

1401216676|4.0|The Killing Joke was a great graphic novel (use novel lightly because of how short it was, somewhere around 40 some pages) and had truly fantastic artwork in it and the story is just another example showing how the joker is just insane and truly just enjoys the sight of people going insane. HOWEVER if you just got done reading a truly violent book or something mind boggling DO NOT READ THIS RIGHT AWAY. Because it will surely make the book seem disapointing in comparison. Unfortunately I did not realize this and hours after i read Watchmen (also by alan moore) the book was good but like i said there was no comparison. I feel that once i read this again after I get past the \\"somewhat\\" dissapointment the book will be better.  This would be a five star book if i would have known or if more sadistic torture occured. But thats just me.
B001EN71CW|5.0|One of the best SciFi shows of all time.  Cancelled way too early (was on Fox - need I say more).  Another original Gem from the mind of legendary Joss Wheadon (The Avengers, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, The Cabin in the Woods, etc.).  Highly recommend this along with the movie Serenity.
1906694176|4.0|Lisbeth Salander of course resides at the heart of this book like the eye of a huricane around which all sorts of heavy winds blow. Mikael Bomkvist, the journalist, Erika Berger, a colleague and lover, Annika Giannini, Blomkvist's sister and a feminist lawyer, the police, Milton security, Alexander Zalachenko who is a Russian defector and Salander's father, various sections of the Swedish governement, a motorcycle gang and a doctor are examples of some of these winds that create quite a storm of action and suspense and intrigue. The most interesting character, at least to me, is Salander herself, the quasi autistic savant with world class hacker skills and contacts. The book is a about love, sex, justice and injustice, murder, politics gone awry as well as tormented relationships and the pros and cons of the power of the media. The author does a great job of interweaving multiple threads of a story and wrapping things up nicely in the end in a dramatic courtroom scene. The book gets a little tedious in parts where the story gets bogged down in some details that aren't all that interesting but the finish was masterfully done. Also, sometimes the characters sound the same in their thought processes. Overall this book is quite interesting and fun especially if you like pollitical intrigue with some of the darker sides of life thrown in the mix.[[ASIN:1931391912 The Griffon Trilogy (Pt. I)]]
B000Q66JXA|4.0|The first time I saw this movie (years back) in cable I thought it was one pf the best King Arthur movies I've eve saw.  I was surprised to see Patrick Steward and Liam Neeson in it.<br /><br />When I saw this was going to be launched in Blue-Ray it was no brainer.  The movie is as expected... since is an old movie, the production is not very good:  Terrible sound effects, terrible fighting scenes, not very good acting, etc.<br /><br />...But I still think is a good King Arthur movie.<br /><br />I was strucked when I found out Morgana is actually Hellen Mirren!!.  You can see her nowadays in RED with Bruce Willys and Morgan Freeman.  She was H-O-T in her days.<br /><br />What it lacked this edition is some special features.  Maybe interviews with the actors would be nice but nothing of that.
B002ZG99TA|4.0|I'm a railfan and I like watching trains. I therefore am awarding this movie one star more than I think should really be the case. It's a well-made film, with lots of action and just enough character development to make the principle characters (though not what they are portrayed as doing) credible. The star of the movie is the train, and here I must give a tip of the hat to director Tony Scott for using as much real railroad footage as possible, even though I have to say that to someone accustomed to watching trains the speeds claimed by the movie are patently not the speeds at which the trains are running.    Never mind, it's all good, clean, edge-of-the-seat fun and if the ending is rather predictable (and belies the title) I'm old-fashioned enough to be happy with that.    The two documentaries are very good, but I'd caution anyone who decides to switch on Tony Scott's commentary that his style is a stream-of-consciouness ramble which tells you a lot about Tony Scott but not much about what you are watching on the screen. Four stars for railroad buffs- perhaps an 'It's OK' three stars for everyone else.
0061537969|1.0|This author totally missed the point of writing from the perspective of a dear, sweet animal.  He laced his book with so much Hollywood type vile and offensive language that the beauty of the dog's life gets totally lost.  A dog using the F word, the S word, the B words--really??? C'mon.  This book lost me a fourth of the way through because of the stupid and unbelievable language. I would not recommend this book to anyone.  I threw my copy in the trash.

0439023513|4.0|It made me sad. Lots of it made me sad. I definitely liked the book. And LOVED the series. Honestly, I think it's one of the best trilogies that I've read in a LONG time. There were a lot of shocks and surprises (not all the time good) in this one, and a lot of things that just completely broke my heart. But I think it tied up the story nicely. Kind of wish there'd been some way to keep the series going, but I realize that it probably would have made it start to suck if that had happened. I always hate it when I'm done with the last book though. GrRrR.<br /><br />Seriously though, the Hunger Games trilogy was outstanding. I'm almost afraid to watch any movie version because I know I'll do what I always do and completely tear it apart before remembering that the movie is not the book. But if the movie is even half as good as the books were then I know I'll have a new favorite film in no time.<br /><br />I mean wow.<br /><br />If you haven't read them, I strongly suggest it.<br /><br />Or I will find you, tie you to a chair, and read them to you.<br /><br />Yes.<br /><br />I said it.

B004A8ZWT2|4.0|I enjoyed this movie much more than I thought I would. It has a retro feel to it, nice chemistry with Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie and it had just enough twists to keep me engaged. The parts shot in Venice were beautiful. Worth a watch!
0307346617|4.0|I am not a zombie fan.  I have seen a few Romero films and they are not for me.  I picked this book up because it kept getting recommended over and over.  What a gem.  The environment is very well thought out especially the military strategies.  The author put a lot of time and thought into what would happen globally.  This is a good book that you can pick up and put down over a few weeks.  I highly recommend it.
0307454541|5.0|It took me a while to read this book because so many people told me it was great.  That, for some reason almost always leads to me being very disappointed.  Boy, was I wrong.<br /><br />The story hooked me immediately and I couldn't put the book down.  I was reading until well past bedtime and suffered for it the next day, but I couldn't help myself.<br /><br />There are already thousands of reviews out there so mine would only be a rehash of others thoughts, so I will only say that I loved this book and the girl with the dragon tattoo.  I found her to be completely refreshing and an odd heroine, but that is what makes this authors storytelling so good.  My only problem with the book was getting stuck in my own head on how to pronounce some of the Swedish words.  A minor complaint at that - give this a try.  I can't wait to read the next installment - it is sitting right next to me as I type this.
0670022411|1.0|Discovery of Witches got the kind of publicity and artwork most authors of urban fantasy probably dream about, but then return to reality and taper their expectations back down.  Sadly, all of that publicity and the gorgeous artwork are nothing but a sham, a disguise for what is ultimately a poorly plotted paranormal romance that even falls through on delivering the romance.  I think even the lamest of Harlequin romances probably does a better job of showing what a budding romance looks like than Discovery of Witches managed, and Harlequin does it in a matter of 20-30 pages rather than Discovery's 582 pages.    So, here are my biggest complaints about A Discovery of Witches.  Discovery is purportedly about the mysterious magical book called Ashmole 782, and the incredibly powerful witch who inadvertently finds this work, which then causes an uproar in the supernatural community.  The inside cover teaser mentions vampires, daemons, and witches all while implying that the story is primarily about solving the mystery of Ashmole 782 and its appearance in the hands of Diana Bishop, our powerful witchy heroine.  In reality, Discovery is a weak example of paranormal romance between the witch, Diana Bishop, and a 1500 year old vampire scientist, Crusader, and hero who happened to be working nearby when Diana finds Ashmole 782.  Sadly, as an incredibly powerful witch and our heroine, Diana's character is way short of the mark.  In many parts of the book, what we are \\"told\\" in backstory about Diana's powers and her independent personality -- does not match up once the action is going.  Instead, when Harkness \\"shows\\" us Diana as a character in action, she is utterly dependent on Matthew for protection, and is in such complete denial of her awe-inspiring magic powers that she refused to learn even the most basic means of witchy self defense.  Matthew comes to her rescue over and over again, and Diana proves herself to be a helpless, clueless little woman who needs the protection of the big, bad ancient vampire.  A vampire who is so old-fashioned, and so determined to protect her from everything (her enemies, her own idiotic helplessness) that he refuses to consummate their marriage.  Sadly, these two characters are not worth 600 pages.  Neither of them demonstrates the kind of passion, and joie de vivre, that would have made a story only about their romance worthwhile reading.  When you put two mediocre characters into a poorly plotted, wannabe mystery, in the end no one is satisfied.    The saddest thing about A Discovery of Witches is that this story could have been so much more.  The potential and the intriguing premise surrounding the mysterious Ashmole 782 is real.  But in the end, Harkness failed to deliver on that potential, and in trying to make her book be a romance, and a mystery, with historical elements, and supernatural elements; she failed to achieve even one of those.  My biggest disappointment in the book is that with so much publicity, and obviously so much money funneled into making Discovery a success -- the author did not put the time or effort required into making sure her story actually lived up to all the hype.  Either the publisher or editors should have given her more time, or someone should have given her more guidance on how to effectively create a romance within a mystery without ending up with nothing but watered down, ineffective versions of both.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|wow i cant believe some one would write that much about a movie...  i personally loved the movie and im 22.  now i would not recommend it for younger children because they might think its ok to start disobeying Mom and Dad.  but the older ones will understand her dilemma.  i have watched it twice now and could watch it again...
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|Let me start off by saying that I loved the first two books and like the other two book I could not put this one down.  But I absolutely hated this book.  It made me feel like I wasted hours of my life reading and getting attached to these characters.  A protagonist should grow as a person as the story progresses not regress.  After finishing this book I feel that Katniss is less a person then in the first book.  What happened to the selfless girl willing to sacrifice herself for her sister?  She wallows in self despair as the Capitol cuts out her spine.  Despite all her success Snow beats her in the end.  Collins should have just killed her and been done with it.  It would have been less cruel. So if you read the other two books you will finish this one too.  Katniss character development is stunted.  Peeta is brainwashed into hating her but also stunted.  Gale is fleshed out but his motivation is disappointing.  The end was horrible.  The conclusion K draws about District 13 isnt really justified for her actions at the end.  It honestly felt like Collins had great plans for this book and had a creative block somewhere in the middle and ran into her publishing deadline and slopped what she had into the end.  It was a sad dissapointing end to a great series.  If this was the first book I would have never continued.  Because it was the last I suffered through it.  Skip it!  Write or imagine your own ending.  It will be better than this one.
031603438X|5.0|I always loved Keith Richards and was fascinated by him. I read so many books about the Rolling Stones over the years, and thought I knew a lot about his life, but this did not compare to the experience of reading about it from the one who lived it.  The book had so many amazing bits and pieces of Keith's very incredible life, all told with honesty and a sense of humor.  It made me love him even more because he is so genuine.  One of a kind.  I'm so happy he decided to tell his own story because really one never knows what to believe when reading what other people have to say about him.  In this book he clarifies all the rumors, and whoever reads it can feel like now they know the real Keith Richards.  Fantastic book, I read it in just a few days and didn't want to put it down.
B0042816YK|3.0|Was curious about this film since it includes two of my favorite actors, James Franco and Javier Bardem. I didn't read the book prior to seeing the film. Julia Roberts was refreshing; I felt she was at ease in her acting and not trying so hard as I've often seen in her previous films.     If you've ever experienced a failed marriage and have a sense of adventure, in a modern way, you may relate well to this film.     Three men, three countries, one final positive outcome for her. (What a fairytale!)    Julia Roberts plays a soon-to-be-divorced woman fortunate enough to be able to travel long term and to the places she has chosen: Italy, India, and Bali. We see her willingness to explore her inner self, meet new people (mainly the non-threatening kind), and connect the hurt pieces of herself to the world. The best character and acting job goes to Richard Jenkins (Richard from Texas); his sincere portrayal of a man haunted by his actions hit me hard.     We see the guilt for her husband (Billy Crudup), the fling(?) with David (James Franco), and her bond to Philippe (Javier Bardem).     I could relate to all three relationships so I found the film enjoyable.
B00433TO52|5.0|As I had another version of the complete works of Shakespeare in old-fashioned book format, I hesitated a while before buying the same thing for Kindle. What was the point? I knew most of the plays anyway, being a WS fangirl. I was finally tempted by the apocryphal content. A couple I had heard of, but most of them I didn't know.<br /><br />One of the advantages of the Kindle (and forgive me for stating the obvious) is that no matter what size the material you are reading is, your book format remains the same. And this is no small consideration when you're dealing with a writer as prolific as Will. My paper and ink version is an absolute doorstep and therefore I'm hardly going to pick it up on a whim to re-read Hamlet, however much I love the play. Now, however, it's as simple as clicking on the list in the table of contents.<br /><br />The layout is easy to read, the content doesn't need me to review it, and I'm thoroughly enjoying spending time with old friends. Five stars.
1931559317|5.0|I scanned the book when I got the book first time. Actually it is well prepared and the charts were well chosen according to the need of amateurs.The charts are not glaring when illuminated with a flash light and it is very handy to use in the field as well.It is very comprehensive and clear as the charts were not congested with stars and labeling. Previously I used to use computer softwares in the field but it is always distract the attention out of the objects.But keeping this book beside my head I experienced the true star hopping experience. So I recommend this book to any one who wish not to have disappointing in the field of stars.  Also I like to say something about the Amazon.com.They have worked in timely manner. My book was sent with good and very secure packing.They have taken every possible steps to keep the book in safe during the long run to me.  Thank you very much Amazon.com.

1599218011|3.0|Ok, I didn't realize how famous this book was when I first got it.  Apparently it's a brand with a documentary and Oprah and everyone else behind it.  Sorry, I didn't realize that.<br /><br />I picked it up recently because it was on sale and I was looking for some diet/nutrition books that were women-friendly and wife-friendly, and upbeat. I was looking for something inspiring to stick with the program since I have four kids and a busy life, and have tried whole food diets many times without being able to stick to them long term.<br /><br />In that area, Kris Corr delivers. She is upbeat and encourages you to stick to the program. What I didn't realize from the front cover was that it was going to be a book on how to become a vegan. It also includes all the more radical steps like enemas, colonics, kale smoothies, dry brushing, neti (sinus irrigation), etc. I am not sure I would have picked it up if I knew that, since I was looking for more of the moderate whole food approach.  She's also anti-gluten, anti-chemical (i.e. anti coffee, anti-alcohol, anti-prescriptions, anti-Maybelline) and pro-raw.  This may not be doable for everybody. Still, she does make it sound compelling and offers ideas of how to start. And she does give ideas if you're going to compromise a little. She says she still has a bottle of Advil in her cabinet for emergencies and makes a point to talk about enjoying your life, even when that means a glass of wine here or there.  So I appreciated that.<br /><br />I also appreciated her section on alkalinity.  It made a lot of sense and had some great tips on how to begin alkanalizing your body.  She did say radical things like oats and brown rice weren't as healthy for you, which always raises a yellow flag for me.  I always worry that that kind of distinction can lead into the mentality that your diet is never strict enough.  But then she has the health to back up her statements, so I can't pontificate too much about that! I appreciated her points anyway.<br /><br />I did not appreciate, however, what a potty mouth she was.  For someone who got into finding her spiritual side and weeding out stinking thinking, her language sure seems contradictory.  She is trying to be good-natured and encouraging, I know, but there were enough swear words in it that I was hoping my kids wouldn't oversee.  I was also a little unsure about lending it to some of my more reserved mom friends.  I give her full, full credit and respect for kicking inoperable cancer and having a great attitude about it.  But I think the cursing and party-girl slang everywhere made it seem TOO much like a marketing ploy.  Like she's trying to force dieting to be fun and flirty by talking like a college co-ed.  It is refreshing from all the science jargon that many doctorates in nutrition write, but she has all the scientific jargon in there anyway.  Between s*** this and f*** that.  So I found it unnecessary.  She could have been upbeat and countercultural without it.<br /><br />(If you like that stuff, Skinny Bitch actually does a better job anyway.  This book is like Skinny Bitch in novel form!)<br /><br />And I really didn't appreciate how she brought her political affiliation into the book.  I am not sure why Democrats assume that only Democrats care about diet.  Actually many, many conservatives are just as \\"back to nature\\" as anyone else, and saying you're a Democratic, beer-swilling party girl doesn't help the book appeal more widely to people who would otherwise read it.  I am a conservative, I like sexy, and I have the same reservations she does about FDA endorsement, government policies, the corn/soy lobby, and being wasteful.  I am not criticizing her for being what she is, but why bring it into a diet book?  Her points could have been made with the science and good attitude alone.<br /><br />So in the end, I really wrestled with whether to give this book four stars or three stars.  As a diet book with good ideas and helpful descriptions of detox, it is a four.  For the party-girl language and tone, I give it a three.  It is strong enough to get in the way of the reading.  I liked the book enough, but it wasn't what I was expecting.it a three.  It is strong enough to get in the way of the reading.  I liked the book enough, but it wasn't what I was expecting.
B002ZG997C|1.0|Christians, please do not watch this film! I am a Bible believing Christian who believes in the second coming of our Lord Jesus, and a great tribulation after the rapture of his Church, but I cannot recommend the film.  A good ending is no excuse for all the F-bombs and the expletive GD in a movie that appeals to Christian audiences. It is very violent and full of offensive language. There is also much violence against women including rapes and beatings.   I do know that these will be common in the end times, but we have a good imagination and expect these things to be left out of a film that is supposed to appeal to us. I shredded my copy to avoid offending anyone else.    Acting: very good, movie making quality: very good, moral rating: very low. This movie is a very offensive and has few redeeming qualities.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I can't keep any sort of earbuds in my ears and longed for the days of my old Sony Walkman headphones. After reading a lot of favorable reviews of these headphones I figured, why not? Especially given the low price. Well, they're everything the other reviewers said they'd be--great sounding, lightweight, comfortable, and they stay in my ears! They don't block a lot of ambient sound, but for me that's a good thing, as I use them primarily when walking my dog, and I need to be able to hear the traffic around me. Some reviewers complained that they don't last very long. I've only had mine a month or so, so I can't comment about their long-term durability. So far they're still fine. For the low price, I bought three pairs, figuring if they did break soon, I'd have backups. I am so glad I didn't spend big bucks on anything else. These are perfect.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|When I first heard about this book, I was a little hesitant in reading it.

On Lullaby, Lavigne sheds much of her `bratty,' `punkier' side in favor of a more serious, melancholy, `divorced' theme album.  There are worthwhile moments, but overall, Goodbye Lullaby is more of a `bore' than a genuinely enthralling effort.  Even since it has been edited to be approved by Lavigne's label, it still feels that some more appropriate, better conceived songs may have tightened this effort more. With a host of producers including Lavigne's victim of choice, ex-husband Deryck Whibley (Sum 41), the album still fails to achieve the fun of 2007`s [[ASIN:B000NA1OXY The Best Damn Thing]] or better yet, her lauded debut, [[ASIN:B000066NW0 Let Go]].<br /><br />After an off-putting intro like cut, \\"Black Star,\\" Lavigne smartly starts the album off right with the Max Martin & Shellback assisted first single, \\"What The Hell.\\" The album's best cut arguably, \\"What the Hell\\" seeks to capture the \\"Girlfriend\\" (#1 hit off of her last album) demographic.  While \\"Girlfriend\\" is most likely to be sealed in the pop history books as the more memorable cut, \\"What the Hell\\" is fun enough. \\"Push,\\" produced by Deryck Whibley is the about the best showing from Lavigne's ex where he controls the board.  The rhythmic guitars are a nice touch, but the verses, particularly the first, are a bit too wordy.  While the chorus tries to atone for Lavigne's motormouthed antics, it just doesn't quite captivate as much as, well, \\"What the Hell.\\"<br /><br />\\"Wish You Were Here\\" is another victorious moment, in the same vein as \\"What The Hell.\\" Why?  Max Martin and Shellback are behind the boards, the songwriting is `bratty' and `immature' and it highlights the Avril that fans have come to respect (if that's the right word) and love.  The vocal production surrounding Lavigne's vocals are perfect, highlighting her whiny timbre.  \\"Smile,\\" also contributed by Martin and Shellback is enjoyable, even if Lavigne may slightly grow overwrought with multiple expletives within the same line.  Where production is concerned, \\"Smile\\" ranks highly on the `totem pole.'<br /><br />\\"Stop Standing There\\" brings in Butch Walker producing, though Avril holds down the songwriting duties on her own.  It's not bad, but marks the first true shade of inconsistency that rears its ugly head upon this effort.  \\"I Love You\\" brings back the `dream team' of Lavigne, Martin & Shellback working in tandem with one another, but the airy nature of the cut just doesn't quite suit Lavigne.  \\"Everybody Hurts\\" is ok, but by this point, Whibley's rhythmic guitar texture has grown to archetypical to live an air of mysteriousness about his productions.  \\"Not Enough,\\" another Whibley production (written by Lavigne and Evan Taubenfield) is merely average, with the redeeming quality being the layers of vocals that cap off the end.<br /><br />\\"4 Real,\\" which is all Avril - songwriting and production - is a better cut, though again, the light vibe of Avril is just so out-of-place it hurts the cut.  \\"Darlin,\\" another cut by Avril, finds her speeding up the tempo slightly, but still sounds only `second rate' to her best performances and career high watermarks.  \\"Remember When\\" is bland, while \\"Goodbye\\" is pretty, but unmemorable.  The Hidden cut \\"Alice\\" brings Butch Walker back on the boards, but doesn't save the second half of the album from falling into the abyss of the sheer unexceptional.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B004FGMV0W Goodbye Lullaby]] is a nice attempt by Lavigne to make a serious, break-up oriented effort that so many artists go for whether it be Marvin Gaye, Usher, Pink, etc.  The problem is, Lavigne compromises herself as the artists that fans have come to know and love and this more `somber' side is less convincing and vivacious.

B000002KY8|4.0|By the time that Prince released 1999 in 1982, he was already a music-industry veteran with four albums to his name, one of them a straight-up classic. Coming on the heels of the slick and relatively successful Prince (1979), the stripped-down, New Wave-influenced, and lyrically filthy Dirty Mind (1980) had served notice that Prince was more than just another R&B funkmeister and/or balladeer while simultaneously horrifying his record company and momentarily stopping his building commercial momentum cold. Said momentum was restarted handily, however, by 1999. For most in suburban white-bread America, this is where the Prince story really begins, the story of a musician who would dominate pop music for the next decade.    And that's kind of funny, because 1999 is hardly a conventional pop album. It's a double, first of all. And there are just eleven songs spread over its four sides, many of them extended workouts stretching toward the ten-minute mark. When we look a little closer, what we see here is Prince learning to balance his artistic ambitions with commercial considerations, something he became almost uniquely gifted at. And so he delivers the pop on the first side, in the form of the unstoppable (if now dated) party jam \\"1999,\\" the melodic funk of the album's monster hit \\"Little Red Corvette,\\" and the perky and too often forgotten little gem \\"Delirious.\\" With that dispensed with, Prince feels free to get a bit weird over the next three sides.    Whether it's a case of overexposure or something else, for me that's where 1999 really begins. Songs as long as most of these are just crying out for pat rock-critic responses -- \\"could have used some editing,\\" \\"this would have made a terrific single album with a little judicious pruning,\\" etc. -- but I'm not going to indulge. As someone who grew up listening to Yes and Pink Floyd, I rather like long songs, if they're doing something interesting. And these epics are consistently interesting, chock full of sudden change-ups, instrumental breakdowns, and groove, groove, groove. I wouldn't have \\"D.M.S.R.\\" (8.17), \\"Automatic\\" (9.28), or \\"Lady Cab Driver\\" (8.19) one second shorter. Unlike so many dance and electronica acts -- and make no mistake, 80% of the instruments on this album come equipped with a microprocessor -- Prince knows how to construct long songs that actually go someplace, rather than repeating and juxtaposing a handful of fragments again and again.    Lyrically... well, this is a pre-Jehovah's Witness Prince album, so you know what you're in for. I have to say, though, that what seemed excitingly transgressive on Dirty Mind is already growing stale here. It's not so much the \\"suggestive\\" content (where would music be without sex?) as the really direct stuff that irritates me. When Prince says he wants to \\"F the taste out of your mouth\\" in \\"Let's Pretend We're Married,\\" for instance, it doesn't sound exciting or sexy at all. It just sounds like a little boy with a potty mouth; one feels Prince should be outgrowing this sort of thing by now. There's also an element of dominance and submission, even of rape fantasy, to some of these tracks. This is most pronounced on \\"Lady Cab Driver,\\" in which Prince -- sorry, there's no better way to put this -- hate-Fs a woman, while we hear her screams of either ecstasy or pain -- we aren't quite sure which. Call me a prude, but I have to admit that I find this somewhere between embarrassing and genuinely disturbing when I play the album today. I like to think that some of it is played for laughs, and, indeed, a song like \\"International Lover\\" is so over the top that it's impossible to take it seriously as a seduction ballad. In a stirring victory of delusions of grandeur over reality, Prince, 5'2 tall and 115 pounds soaking wet, tells his would-be lover how lucky she is that \\"this body [his] is free tonight,\\" and then proceeds to make increasingly strained metaphors between sex and air travel for the next six minutes or so.    Moreinteresting to a digital historian like me is Prince's obsession with computer technology, not only in his instrumentation but lyrically in tracks like \\"Something in the Water (Does Not Compute).\\" Computers would continue to be a theme not only in Prince's work but in the work of many other musicians from this period: Kraftwerk's Computer World, Laurie Anderson's \\"O, Superman,\\" etc. It's an instructive reminder that, before the Internet revolution of the mid-1990s, there was another computer revolution, as the little machines were suddenly everywhere: in homes, in arcades, and of course in music, and that they were therefore on lots of people's minds.    While mostly performed on synthesizers and drum machines, Prince's one-man band does include occasional guitar. Prince has always ladled out his guitar leads very sparingly, a move that, whether done purposefully or not, has probably done a lot to enhance his reputation as a guitar god. (If he only delivers one or two solos per album, it's hard to see how limited his bag of tricks really is.) This album is no exception to that, with only \\"Automatic\\" and especially \\"All the Critics Love You in New York\\" containing prominent leads, although several others contain tasty examples of Prince's ironically underrated rhythm and bass playing. \\"New York\\" is a particular delight, with Prince carving out shards of noise from his guitar over thumping electronics and half-spoken lyrics that are for once about neither sex nor computers, but rather about the pretentiousness of the New York music scene. It reminds me of the best track Yoko Ono ever cut, \\"Walking on Thin Ice,\\" anchored as that track is by the most interesting guitar parts John Lennon ever played.    \\"New York\\" would have been unimaginable on an earlier Prince album. Indeed, the whole of 1999 shows an already accomplished artist dramatically expanding his range. That's in fact literally true -- after singing on earlier albums virtually exclusively in falsetto, Princesuddenly shifts to his normal register most of the time here, while always keeping that gorgeous falsetto in reserve for the times when he really needs it. One could argue that Prince's refusal to grow emotionally as he grew musically ultimately keep him from joining the pantheon of the greatest of the great. That musical growth is so pronounced on this album, though, that Prince's limitations can be easy to overlook, at least while it's playing.
B0038BBA4I|5.0|Mumford and Sons got it right, at least for me.  I haven't heard a complete CD this good in so many years I couldn't actually figure out how long, I'm guessing 15 years.  Every song is great, there isn't one I don't like.  It is going to be hard to top this when the next CD comes out.  The mixture of banjo with a rock sound is a pretty unique one that I haven't heard anyone else get this well.  If you want to hear something different that makes your toes tap constantly then buy this CD.

096798467X|5.0|I just happened to see this in my local public library when I was looking at the new book shelf.  I wasn't looking for a book like that but it looked fascinating.

0061726826|5.0|I can honestly say that I now know why everyone's been raving on about Lauren Oliver! Delirium is a wonderful begining to a new dystopian trilogy. If you're looking for some great dystopia to fill in the void after the last book in The Hunger Games trilogy then I strongly recommend you to check out Delirium(even if you didn't like THG you should definitely check out this novel).<br /><br />Delirium is the first book in a new dystopian trilogy by Lauren Oliver, the author behind Before I Fall(which I have yet to read but I do own a copy of it). I'm more often than not a bit skeptical to novels that receive much praise, my expectations is sky high and I'm often let down but I'm glad to say that Delirium did not let me down one bit!<br /><br />Oliver has taken inspiration from the past years flu epidemics and created a world(or a state actually) where love is a disease which must be avoided at all costs. It's a scary scenario, can you imagine what it would be like if people couldn't feel love?<br /><br />The main character, Lena, has been told all her life how horrible a disease love is, why should she doubt that information? I mean there's plenty of evidence in the human history that shows us the horrible things love can do to a person. In Delirium the story of Romeo and Juliet is being used in schools to serve as an example of the terrible disease that love is.<br /><br />Lena's family has a bad reputation due to family scandals in the past and Lena longs for her procedure and counts the days until it's her turn. Lena want's so bad to be just like everyone else, she longs for a life where she no longer needs to fear getting amor deliria nervosa. Lena's best friend Hana is almost Lena's opposite when it comes to getting the cure. Before the cure everyone has to be evaluated and when the day has arrived Hana says the following to Lena:<br /><br />'You can't be really happy unless you're unhappy sometimes. You know that, right?'<br /><br />Hana scares Lena. It is strictly forbidden to utter negative opinions about the cure. If you do resist the goverment and the cure you might have to take the procedure before it is safe, you might be thrown into the crypts or worse..<br /><br />I really liked the characters in this novel, they were belivable and cleverly written. My favorite character was Grace, Lena's six year old cousin, who due to a traumatic experience dosen't speak one word. Grace just somehow touched my heart. This story has it all; action, romance, tragedy, angst and more.bout the cure.

B00004ZB9D|3.0|Kravitz is indisputably an excellent musician, and occasionally also an excellent songwriter. This collection covers a period of just over ten years of his career, and one thing that strikes you is the rather large variation in the genre. It ranges from blues and heavy over to pure pop. Common to all is the thoroughly  professional production - but where's the excitement and originality in all this smooth perfection?<br /><br />There are of course some excellent songs, which in no way come out particularly original, and therefore never really hit you..<br /><br />I think he is the best in the melodic ballads like \\"Can not Get You Off My Mind, \\" \\"Stand By My Woman, \\" \\"Believe, \\" \\"Again\\" and \\"Let Love Rule\\".<br /><br />It is not an album that makes me curious to get better acquainted with his original albums.

0618526412|5.0|This is a classic and has been well critiqued by many more versed than myself. It's a very interior book in that it's more about what happens in the minds of the characters. The setting, during the segregated south, is perfect for this sort of torturous outward/inward life these people endured. Yes, it's depressing, but McCullers very convincingly takes you to these strange places in the minds of her characters. This historical aspect, while familiar in a textbook sense, really makes you feel the agony of it all.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|I admit it, I am a cheapo.  Why pay for anything when you can get it for free?   Well, in the case of Angry Birds, this super-addicting game, I recommend you *splurge* and go for the paid version at a whopping 99¢.  I was frustrated with the birds being high in the air and then tapping on them only to accidentally hit one of the ads and have to back out of that.  Argh!  Make the screen smaller on my Thunderbolt so I could avoid the ad and I almost went blind.  After trying for ages on one level, I broke down, downloaded the paid version and went right back to my game (paid version overwrites so you don't lose anything) and conquered the level quickly.  Plus the paid version seems to operate smoother and faster.
0547258305|4.0|To think Graceling was Kristin Cashore's debut novel is just unfathomable to me, it is such a great fantasy adventure story. Somehow I believed there would be some magic in this story but there isn't, and I didn't miss it at all, the novel does very well without.<br /><br />At first I was really hung up on one thing, stupid of me really, and that was the fact that Katsa's name was so much like Suzanne Collins Katniss(in The Hunger Games trilogy).  As I started getting more and more into the story I luckily forgot all about that.<br /><br />Katsa is such a great character, she is strong yet she is very vulnerable. Throughout the novel Katsa slowly changes into a more confident person, it feels very real considering how her life has been like. Cashore has also created a set of wonderful supporting characters for the reader to fall in love with. To name a few we have Katsa's cousin, Prince Raffin, who loves to experiment by making all kinds of medicine, then we have the graceling fighter from the kingdom of Lienid, Prince Po and the intelligent Princess Bitterblue who had to grow up way before her time.<br /><br />The romance in this novel is so sweet and feels true, Katsa doesn't fall in love within five minutes of meeting the guy. The relationship develops over a bit of time and the boy she falls for is kind and gentle. No bad boy, at least not in this first book.

0553381695|2.0|I'm sorry to say that I'm less than satisfied - the story is fine (so far), but the book itself leaves much to be desired (especially for such an expensive paperback). The paper is only a step above newsprint, there were pre-production top-to-bottom creases in many of the pages that disrupted the printing (and now break up the text on both sides), and the size of the type varies from line to line (this may not change the story, but it can be distracting). If/when I purchase the third installment, I'll definitely be looking for a different publisher.

I would definitely recommend to anyone who is young at heart and has ever had a dream.

B0041KKYDI|5.0|I was curious to see how the director/screenwriter Danny Boyle was going to pull this one off.  After all, it is about one man's struggle to survive with no other characters to help the movie along.  He did not disappoint.  James Franco was FANTASTIC as Aron Ralston!  I watched it with my family and none of us were bored.  The movie was short (1.5 hrs only.)  I just wished that the DVD had included interview with Ralston and other special features on how the movie was made.  (The DVD only had deleted scenes and the director's commentary.) At the end of the movie, we did see the REAL Aron Ralston, but it was a very short clip.<br /><br />This is NOT an action pack, fast-paced movie, so if you are looking for that, you won't find it here.  This movie is about human survival and how, when faced with inevitable, what we choose to do.  I'm sure Boyle took some liberty from the actual event, but the movie turned out great - just like Ralston himself, who continues to climb mountains to this day.  Only now, he always makes sure to let people know where he's going!

B004G6009U|5.0|I have 3 little ones in the house the Disney Channel is always on.  When this movie was coming out, there were 100s of previews everyday.  I half expected I had already seen the movie before I got there.  Not the case.  The previews only show a small portion of the amazing comedy, fun adventure and a fantastic story.   I have seen it many times, and each time I notice something new, and the story always flows.     I am a 39 year old Dad, and this movie is on my top 10 list.    I recommend this movie to everyone.  It is a nice escape from the real world.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I saw Wicked last New Years' Day and straightaway fell in love, so I requested the soundtrack for my birthday, coming up four weeks later. It took me a little while to get into the songs I didn't like so much in the musical, but I love most songs:  \\"No One Mourns The Wicked\\"-5/10. It's way too long and pointless if you haven't seen the musical, but worth a listen.  \\"Dear Old Shiz\\"-3/10. Shorter, but not worth any of your time.  \\"The Wizard And I\\"-9/10. Idina Menzel's first solo, as Elphaba dreams of her life when she works with the Wizard. Beautiful.  \\"What Is This Feeling\\"-10/10. A great duet with Kristin Chenoweth as Galinda and Idina Menzel (again) as Elphaba. A bouncy song about how much they hate each other. Brilliant.  \\"Something Bad\\"-5/10. It's good, but nothing special. Idina's solo lines are perfect here, though.  \\"Dancing Through Life\\"-8/10 A little too long, but a good introduction to such characters as Fiyero, Nessarose and Boq. Worth listening to. Also Boq and Nessa's only song on the CD (Although in the musical, both sing part of \\"Wicked Witch Of The East\\")  \\"Popular\\"-10/10. What can I say? It's definitely a bubblegum pop type, yet it's so catchy and fun to sing. The happiest song on the CD.  \\"I'm Not That Girl\\"-10/10. A sweet slow ballad when Elphaba expresses how she feels about Fiyero, but how she believes he doesn't feel the same way. Another perfect performance by Idina, and quite sad. It would have been tricky to sing, so especially commendable.  \\"One Short Day\\"-8/10. Starts off well, and ends well, but before the end and halfway through it gets boring. Still worth a listen.  \\"A Sentimental Man\\"-2/10. Uninteresting. Not worth a listen.  \\"Defying Gravity\\"-10/10. While I didn't enjoy it as much as some did, Idina definitely did a great performance as her character decides to go her own way. A good finale for the first act.  \\"Thank Goodness\\"-7/10. Weak for this musical, but definitely worth a listen. It just grew on me.  \\"Wonderful\\"-6/10. Worth a listen purely for Idina's line \\"It does sound wonderful\\"-her voice is so lovely. It's not really that good, though. The Wizard's songs aren't that good, no matter who sings them.  \\"I'm Not That Girl(Reprise)\\"-7/10. Not bad, and Kristin sings well, but no point in hearing it if you've listened to Idina's better and longer version.  \\"As Long As You're Mine\\"-8/10. I love Fiyero and Elphaba's romance as much as anyone, but this song doesn't stand out to me.  \\"No Good Deed\\"-11/10. Without a doubt, Idina outdid herself. Elphaba's expression of how she hasn't been able to do any good for herself, and she might as well give up.  \\"March Of The Witch Hunters\\"-6/10. Not great, but OK. Worth a listen.  \\"For Good\\"-7/10. It's so beautiful, but for some reason I just don't click with it.  \\"Finale\\"-7/10. A mix of \\"No One Mourns The Wicked\\" and \\"For Good\\". It's lovely, it's beautiful, but nothing special.  (\\"Wicked Witch of The East\\"-10/10. While this wasn't on the disc, I found it on YouTube, and it's worth hearing, especially for Nessa or Boq fans. Nessa's solo at the end is amazing.)  There you have it. Now go get the CD!
B004L3AR0K|3.0|My husband picked this movie out because I requested a romantic comedy and apparently this movie was touted as one. Anyway, midway through, it became pretty clear this was no romantic comedy.  Don't get me wrong, there are some laughs in here, especially at the beginning when Jamie, the character played by Jake Gyllenhaal shows off his consummate sales skills, and the consequences of his womanizing ways. This guy beds them and leaves them without so much as a thought, but things change when Jamie becomes a sales rep for Pfizer, trying to push Zoloft on doctors.<br /><br />Here, Jamie meets Maggie (Anne Hathaway in a gripping performance) - she suffers from early onset Parkinsons despite being only 26 years old, and though they get off to a rocky start, the pair eventually begin seeing each other, mainly on a casual, strictly sex-only relationship. But, life gets more complicated as Jamie begins to develop deeper feelings for Maggie, and the bulk of the movie explores this complicated, multi-faceted relationship. The core of the story boils down to whether Maggie is prepared to allow Jamie into all aspects of her life, and thus leave herself vulnerable to the very real threat that he may walk out when he realizes the complications that come with Maggie's condition.<br /><br />I felt the sexual chemistry between the two leads was credible and the sex scenes were tasteful and well done. Both actors appeared totally comfortable in their own skins, and viewers get to see plenty of Gyllenhaal and Hathaway in the buff - sex is an integral part of this movie, and not just between the two leads. Viewers also get to see a pajama party in full swing, numerous sexual encounters between the various characters, but it is all part of the story, especially given that Jamie eventually proves his sales skills by peddling Viagra and being very successful at it.<br /><br />It is the two lead performances that kept me engaged and I felt it was a decent effort. Though I would not characterize these roles as the actors' career best, the roles seemed more well-defined through their performances. I also loved one of the songs on the soundtrack, i.e. Billy Bragg's Way Over Yonder in the Minor Key, which I had never heard before and am glad to have discovered through this movie.actors' career best, the roles seemed more well-defined through their performances.

1591843790|5.0|I have read most of Guy Kawasaki's books, and use them in college level classes I teach, and consider Enchantment to be among his best.  I am also a film producer whose job includes effectively communicating my message - to audiences, investors, and distributors.  I found Enchantment to be a valuable source of excellent techniques to do so.  I have recommended this outstanding book to many friends and peers, and know that I - and probably they - will use Enchantment as a reference for years.
193413712X|1.0|The book jumps all over the place.  My book club has been together for 12 years, and we are all having a hard time reading this book. It's confusing the way the book is organized with characters, flash backs, fast forwards, and poetic language. This book doesn't rate for the Pulitzer Prize. My copy of the book won't be passed to family and friends. Will Amazon take it back?
B004G6009U|4.0|Since we bought this when it first came out, my kids have watched it probably 6 or 7 times. They are entertained by it, and I have found it mildly entertaining as a parent. One thing that irritated me as a parent, though, were the amount of songs. Yes, it is Disney, and yes, Disney animation is marked by the songs in its' movies; but I thought they could have cut at least one song. But, it won't irritate an adult as much as some other movies out there.
B000ETRCMQ|1.0|Maybe I'm missing something, but I really did not at all enjoy this movie. I was expecting something similar to Kinky Boots- a funny story with a message underneath, but this just made me depressed! The acting was great, but I really did not find this to be funny in any way.  Bree's story was touching, but I found little growth in her son (Toby's)story. I felt dirty by the end of the movie (not by the TG issue- by Toby's life within the sex industry).     Basically, this movie had great acting and the stars deserve praise for this. But this is by no means a comedy in my book. By the end of the movie I felt depressed.

B0041KKYEM|3.0|I write this review as someone who does not have any bias for or against the director or the performers; I vaguely remember Natalie Portman from Star Wars and Mila Kunis' voice rings a bell--Meg on Family Guy. I don't know Aronofski or his work from Adam.    I was excited by the premise, and by an interview with Aronofski saying he had an \\"Aha!\\" moment at the ballet about basing the story of \\"The Double\\" in the ballet world. So much potential!     Natalie Portman's performance as Nina, an obsessive-compulsive dancer who cracks under heavy pressure from getting her first leading role in Swan Lake--was exquisite! I was also impressed with her dancing..not bad for 6 months' training.*Loved* her in this movie.    Barbara Hershey's character (Nina's mother) was slaughtered by the editing, which is a shame; you really want to know what deep effects her mother, a frustrated former ballerina, had on Nina. You get a snippet or two of her, not enough for the story line.    Ditto Mila Kunis' character as Lily; you get a sort of cartoon depiction of a bad girl, but no depth. Where was the sense of competition with Nina, the looming threat to her of another favored dancer, the director playing the two off against one another? Probably on the (figurative)cutting room floor.      Ditto the dance director, played flawlessly by Vincent Cassel, but again--no connection to Nina's madness other than one snarky remark to Nina, comparing her unfavorably to Kunis. Cassel *was* the perfect dance director, you can see it in his characterization--but not enough of him in the story.      Winona Ryder as the aging star ballerina that Nina replaces--wow, so much could have been done with that! Deleted scenes show what was originally there; Nina's   obsession with Ryder before she replaced her, Nina stealing little personal objects from her dressing table and secretly watching her and following her around.    To sum it all up--I very much enjoyed all of the actors' work and wanted to see more ofall of them in this movie, but heavy-handed editing cut out most of the story line and left us with mostly sex scenes and special effects. Yes, fantastic effects, but where's the story? If you aren't familiar with the story of Swan Lake or The Double, you're out of luck.    I'd like to see the director's cut of this movie. I can't give it a really bad review because I'm hoping that somewhere out there exists a copy of this movie as the director and the actors intended it to be, without time restraints or clumsy editing.
0316044938|5.0|The Lovely Bones is a rare and riveting novel uniquely told in the perspective of a dead girl as she and her family must cope with the tragedy of her death. Susie Salmon was an average fourteen year old with your superficially stereotypical family living in the standard suburban neighborhood of the 70's. Within this everyday setting, Alice Sebold unearthed one of the \\"unthinkables\\" in that type of modern society and community. Through Susie's perspective, readers see the insides and outs of those faced in this type of heartbreaking circumstance. Susie is forced to accept the outcome of her murder as she resides in heaven, looking over the people she left on earth. Her parents' relationship is rocked, and each family member and friends are forced to deal with her untimely murder. Susie's life is ripped away from her too soon, and she never gets the chance to fully grow up; from heaven she watches her sister Lindsey grow up and experience a life she never got the chance to live. Susie struggles to reveal her killer and comfort her loved ones. Meanwhile, her father is tenaciously driven to catch his daughter's murderer and avenge her death. Another shocking truth about the suburban neighborhood is revealed, as Mr. Harvey, the strange man next door, turns out to be a serial killer who made Susie his latest victim in an unsuspecting environment. The community does not want to accept that a deranged serial killer was in their midst living close by, although many conclusions are drawn. The events of her death bring about many connections and represented \\"merely bones of a body that would become whole at some unpredictable time in the near future.\\"  This novel is told in a very down-to-earth tone, exposing one of the tragedies in the American heartland. Sebold's writing style is straightforward, emotional, sentimental, reflective, and optimistic. The plot loses momentum towards the end, but all in all, this is a great read that will keep you reading into the dark hours of the night as you read on to find out what will happen next.

B0000026T4|2.0|Well, here you have it... AC's \\"comeback\\" record.  So, whenever a comeback is calculated, which it almost always is, you have song stylings, contributing musicians, and writers that are thought to aid such a climb back to the top.  Really this album could have been recorded by just about any late 80s hair band.  Desmond Child and Diane Warren have similarly wrecked Heart, Kiss and numerous others in the 80s.  Of course, the general public ate it up in droves.  Alice was once unique and his twisted artistic stamp, even if not always successful (Zipper Catches Skin, DaDa), were all over his works.  Here, it's simply blueprints handed to Alice by some Epic bored room executive.  On the positive, the commercial success of this album (his first platinum since Welcome to My Nightmare) paved the way for him to eventually let his creative juices somewhat flow again.  But even on much better release such as Last Temptation, there were too many contributing writers.  The last song's more accurate title: \\"I'm Your Hired Gun.\\"

B000TLYFI8|4.0|This review addresses an audio issue and is not intended to detract from the historical and artistic importance of this classic session.<br /><br />The Toshiba EMI import release of Eric Dolphy's last US studio date [[ASIN:B000TLYFI8 Out to Lunch]] is, inexplicably, folded into mono. It was originally recorded and mixed in stereo: Left - Center - Right (horns left, bass center, drums right). The Amazon.com sound samples misrepresent the Toshiba EMI CD since they are in stereo, ripped from the domestic RVG Series issue.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this import. It suffers from the same excessive compression found on most of the RVG series reissues. I hope that Joe Harley and Alan Toshida at Audio Wave will consider remastering \\"Out to Lunch\\" as part of their exemplary Blue Note XRCD series.

It was such a hit at our house I ordered one for my nephew (turning 9) for his birthday.  My nephew loves it too!  He took it into school to show all his friends.  If you have an avid lego fan - this book is for you.  There are 2 books in the pack.  One features lego creations and the other one features all the little lego people.  It is great to use as a reference as well - you can look up names of characters, different sets, etc.  Would definitely recommend this book!
1400052181|5.0|This non-fiction book raises the question of what is legal vs. what is moral.  The author thoroughly researched the common practice of doctor's keeping tissue from a patient who is unaware that during a biopsy, for instance, extra tissue was extracted and kept for medical research.  Henrietta Lacks was one such patient.  This story of her amazing tissue and the effect of the resulting research upon her family provides fascinating reading. The book, ordered from Amazon.com, offers rich material for Book Club discussions.

B004FRX0MY|3.0|I love the concept of a cloud drive, especially from my preferred vendor of MP3s, however the player/store needs a reworking. There are some performance issues which I'm sure they're working on since this is the initial launch, however my real gripes are with their overall approach to playing music from a their own remote source.    Why must shopping/playing from cloud/playing locally feel like three completely separate tasks in one app? Instead of trying to jam two apps into one, and still giving the user that segregated feeling, give this app some synergy! I know that's pretty lame buzzword, but listen...    The concept is simple at the high level:  The user's list of tracks should be unification of what is online only, and what they have locally... NOT two separate lists. I'd like to see indicators of a track's source, but I should be able to make a playlist (or at least a track selection) that pulls from BOTH sources. This would actually save their bandwidth to pull from local storage whenever possible. Keep the ability to switch to \\"offline\\" mode, but it should not be the default, and it should NOT feel like a separate app/task/list. Much better user experience.     On top of that, Amazon could sell much more music through the player by giving us the ability to sample music similar to our own library, or what we just listened to. They've got their \\"similar customers\\" logic down pretty good, why not put it right in the player? Don't force it on us, but offer it. As much flack as Apple gets for it's \\"Genius\\" lists, that stuff sells a lot of music. I would think this would be easy for Amazon.    My last suggestion may be a pipe dream but for Android 2.2+ users, Amazon really should tie into the Voice Actions events. When I say \\"Listen to Tool\\" (or better yet, music I don't have) to my phone, the only apps on my phone that support that action are Pandora and Last.fm... Why not Amazon? If it's something I have, play it! If not, give me samples with the ability to quickly purchase. I think that could be a HUGE driver of sales.    THINK ABOUT IT DEVELOPERS, THINK ABOUT IT!    Lastly, as many other reviewers have said, app functionality dedicated solely to browsing for mp3's should be separate... or built into one of your other shopping apps, not into the player. I know you think that's gonna help sell music, but now I have to click extra times to get to the market because I normally use this app as a player, so I normally just wait till I'm at a computer, and sometimes I forget what I wanted to look for. Not an optimal experience for the user (or the salesman)!
B00004Y6NM|2.0|One piece of credit I have to give to Phil Collins - he managed to get Clapton to play some of his best guitar work since his guest appearance on Roger Water's Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking LP.  Unfortunately, most of this blistering guitar work is lost under a heavy blanket of overproduction and drum machines.  This might be the worst collaboration since Jeff Beck picked that awful disco remixer to produce his Flash album.  Save your money and just download Forever Man rather than buying the whole album.

Wonderful writing and very engaging characters are set into an interestingly possible future existence.   By the third show my wife and I were no longer satisfied with watching just one episode a night. After a week we were very happy sleep deprived Firefly fans. The blu-ray set I bought here cost the same as the standard set of DVDs I bought for a friend at Target before Christmas. I don't always choose to buy blu-ray, but for this series you will want to. Everything looks just gorgeous.

B004RZGUBM|5.0|This Delphi Classics edition, indeed, has everything!  The contents are grouped as follows:  The Novels, The Christmas Novellas, The Short Stories, The Christmas Short Stories, The Short Story Collections, The Collaborative Works, The Plays, The Poetry, and The Non-Fiction.    I reached the active Table of Contents by going to Cover and then paging forward.  All the titles have links.  \\"Sketches By Boz\\" also has a link to each chapter, showing both a Roman numeral and the chapter's name.  While I have not read everything, the edition appears to be well-formatted for the Kindle.  The font is very nice, much nicer than the one in the edition I bought several months ago (which I just removed from my device).  I love the wonderful, old illustrations in this collection, which are liberally sprinkled throughout; there are also some photos, such as one of Dickens' home, and some pictures of historical material, such as one at the beginning of The Pickwick Papers showing \\"A full original set of the 19 of 20 Parts, now highly prized as collectors' items.\\"  I was delighted to keep coming across such surprises as I looked through the edition.  A photo of Dickens' grave appears at the very end.    For anyone who is a fan of Charles Dickens and wants a fine collection of everything this great author wrote, you can't go wrong with this Delphi Classics edition.  In my opinion, it is the one to buy!

Do still recommend the primary single disk.
B004G6009K|5.0|My intention is to give 4.5 out of 5 rating. For me, in brief, the good of this movie are 3D effects (more than Christmas Carol), nice animation, nice characters (particularly, the chameleon friend), the colors, etc.    The bad of this movie is only the finishing part of the story. The way princess reunite with her parents is not impressive. How do the parents recognize her as their child without any proof?    Overall, I am happy with this purchase. I hope days will come soon when we get 3D Blurays for $10.
B0011UJMK2|5.0|I studied for a minor in Russian in the mid 80's. We knew some of what life was like in the USSR, but this book (thriller part aside), was a deep look into a repressive society.

1579128149|4.0|Theodore Gray loathes incandescent lightbulbs. With a passion.<br /><br />Fortunately for us, he loves elements. The avid element collector and founder of Wolfram Research shares his affinity for the 118+ substances that comprise the periodic table, and in the process gives us a fascinating, popular overview of the subject. If you can ignore some of the less-than-stellar writing and pontificating about subjects unrelated to the elements, such as the incandescent lightbulb screeds, you'll love this book.<br /><br />The first thing that grabs readers of _The Elements_ is the superlative photography and graphic design. This book is total eye candy. Most of the photos are from the author's collection, and the uniformity of the excellence can't be denied. The design is perfect as well. Even-numbered pages introduce each element with a page-filling depiction and the odd contain text and supporting images of items that consist of the element of note.<br /><br />In addition, Gray and his designers have done a masterful job including the more dry numerical facts about each element in a convenient sidebar on odd pages that mixes pure numbers with easy to comprehend graphs and charts of states of matter temperatures, spectrography, crystallography, and electron shell positions. That succinct, visual consistency would draw raves from Edward Tufte.<br /><br />The author's love of collecting the elements themselves is clear from the text. He adores his subject matter and this comes through in each page. Gray shares not only his passion, but also interesting facts about each element.<br /><br />But the text is the Achilles heel of _The Elements_. In reality, there's not much of it. Often what is there reads as if it came from a _USA Today_ article rather than a science book. In some cases, how Gray feels about an element dominates any facts about it, making the book less than authoritative for the scientifically inclined. _The Elements_ is clearly aimed at the casual reader--and sometimes it is too casual even for them. And then there's the incandescent lightbulb rants...<br /><br />One niggling complaint is that the black pages, while they do an excellent job of providing a background for the superb photography, also show fingerprints like mad. Pages end up splotched with shiny black on regular black, which catches one's eye as much as the excellent photos. A shame.<br /><br />If ever there was a perfect coffee table science book, this would be it. Lovely to look at and filled with just enough text to fulfill its coffee table aspirations, it makes a fine addition to anyone's library, scientist or not.And then there's the incandescent lightbulb rants...

B003XME83W|5.0|Bought this memory after searching for compatible memory for my Asus Eee PC.  This machine is very picky with the memory and will not support the ones that has 16 chips on them, it has to be the memory SODIMM with 8 chips max and these chips are really hard to find.    Even though the netbook is said to use 1066 DDR3 modules, this 800MHz one works perfectly. Also, the Kingston Website indicates that the System supports faster speed modules, but Intel Atom processor runs memory Bus at up to 667MHz, so a 800MHz DIMM seems perfect.    The netbook recognized the memory and boots up with no problems at all. Really recommended for the Asus Eee PC 1001PXD

B001W63DY6|5.0|After having back surgery, it was difficult for me to sleep.  One night when I was struggling to rest, I happened upon a re-run on television of this Barbra Streisand concert.  It was so enjoyable that I relaxed and fell asleep in the chair!  Thereafter, I replayed the concert several times when I continued to experience difficulty sleeping.  Hearing Barbra sing on a CD is one thing, watching her sing and seeing her interaction with the audience is another.  You feel like you are there!  I was thrilled to find that this concert had been recorded on a DVD.  Now I can enjoy it whenever I choose ... and not just to help  me sleep!  Barbra's voice is messmerizing.  With the amazing orchestra accompaniment, the music is beautiful.  I have since given this DVD to a friend after her surgery. If you love Barbra's music as I do, you will love this DVD.

0982743726|3.0|I read The Bone Sword by Walter Rhein as a favor to the man and found it to overall be a pleasant experience. The book is a rollicking, fast-paced adventure with pretty interesting characters, a familiar yet intriguing world and some nice fantastical elements.<br /><br />The good elements of this book included a back story that was revealed at a solid pace, action scenes that really get into the battles, speedy pacing and prose that is generally well-crafted and that at times flows with real magic.<br /><br />A few issues I would raise include a heightened melodrama that at times felt forced or silly, but overall was effective due to its consistency. I think the antagonists, the Earl and Oberon, had some prescience that was a little over the top, in that they seemed to make a pretty big leap in expecting Malik to raise an army.<br /><br />Also the dialogue is stilted at times; the kids don't sound like kids very much. This is to be more or less expected, since kids in this type of world are forced to grow up quickly, but they still sound a little too refined.<br /><br />Also, I am still unsure as to why the grown men were so eager to swear allegiance to an untested young woman.<br /><br />Given those issues, the book in interesting, zips along at a quick pace, and entertains quite effectively. Recommended.

0553573403|5.0|I absolutely adore this book. The writing is superb. The characters are extremely well written. I'm nearly finished with the fourth book and through the whole series Martin consistently shows multiple facets of the characters. Reading this book and the sequels, I've been continuously amazed by how Martin can make you passionately hate a character, only to get deeper into their story where you may not forgive them, but you'll understand. I love that no character is truly safe. Yes, it's depressing if a beloved character dies, but because no character is safe, when they're in danger it actually means something. Reading some of the other reviews I've seen complaints about the amount of characterization and time going into a character, only to have them die off. I think it's excellent. How boring would it be if only barely described people died? You could always tell who was doomed. More importantly, knowing the character makes you feel something when they die. And it makes you truly connect to the characters who are left with their grief.

In between silences, we learn more about the state of the world Kvothe currently inhabits, and we follow his continuing education at the University as well as through his travels. We discover more about his power and abilities, he travels to the land of the Adem, he leads a band of bandit hunters, and gets a shot at one of the Chandrian.<br /><br />But I don't think you want me to summarize the details and events of the book. So on to the quality of what Rothfuss has done.<br /><br />Kvothe continues to be an interesting, complex character with motivations that make him sympathetic and a very proactive way about living life. These are the reasons we love him! He doesn't wait on others; he goes and does what needs to be done. He is a creative thinker, he is terribly violent when needed, and his motivations are very often quite noble.<br /><br />Because of his financial situation and the reactions of the inhabitants of the areas surrounding the University, Kvothe ends up taking a significant leave of absence and traveling. This break is very well motivated by the character and world. The other characters that are introduced are fascinating and have important parts to play in Kvothe's development as well.<br /><br />Rothfuss develops his world splendidly. He convincingly creates several foreign cultures, languages and mythologies. While following Kvothe through the trials he faces, the reader is also challenged to consider his/her ideas about the world and society- which is a nice bonus. But more importantly, the story is intriguing and clips along at a solid pace, with revealing details being ... well.. revealed expertly.<br /><br />There are still laugh-out-loud funny parts. The characters really seem like actual people, so the humor is organic and real. Plus, Kvothe's continuing investigation into the Chandrian is deftly handled; you feel his frustration when he keeps hitting walls in his research.<br /><br />All in all, this is an excellent sequel to The Name of the Wind.<br /><br />I do, however, have a bit of an issue. Pretty spectacular things are wrought by this Kvothe. He doesn't stop to think about it much and wonder why it is he always gets into such significant events. Maybe I'm too much of a second-guesser or I like introspection too much, but Kvothe doesn't allow considerations like that to slow him down. He is always full speed ahead.<br /><br />My other issue is that Rothfuss has tantalized readers a lot and has left readers guessing about a lot of mysteries still. Considering how long it might take Pat to finish the third book, this is kind of rude. I honestly think he could have revealed a little more, too. The trunk at the end.. well, yeah.<br /><br />But the characters, excellent prose, stunning world-building, fantastic story, and the relationships are all entrancing and marvelous.<br /><br />Worth a second read.<br /><br />This gets 5 stars.uing investigation into the Chandrian is deftly handled; you feel his frustration when he keeps hitting walls in his research.

B004I2K4DY|5.0|I had no idea what this musical was about until I saw it. When I first saw that it had Nick Jonas in it, I jumped at the chance to watch it. And when I saw it, I was blown away! If Phantom of the Opera didn't exist, then Les Miz would be my favorite musical. Alfie Boe was awesome, Ramin Karimloo was amazing, and Nick Jonas was shocking! If that's not enough to buy it, then you should just watch it!
B0039TD8LW|5.0|What can i say. This is a great collection from the greatest band in rock history.  The songs rock and this makes a great addition to anyones collection.  Finally someone pays respect to these guys.   I bought this for a collectors item and only palyed it once.  Long Live AC/DC
B001IAOEXU|5.0|For the longest time I've felt the only drawback of the PS3 controller is the L2 and R2 buttons.  Maybe it's just the size of my hands, but they've never felt comfortable.  After long periods of gaming I would have cramping in my index and middle fingers, and general soreness in my hands.  So, when I saw these babies on Amazon for $4.99 I thought \\"what the heck\\" and bought them.  Man, am I glad I did!<br /><br />The Dual Triggers look and feel completely natural.  They're the exact same material as the L1 and R1 buttons so aesthetically they look like they belong.  I'm willing to bet if you handed a person with no experience the PS3 controller they wouldn't be able to tell the buttons have been augmented.  They're also a snap to install, pun intended, and feel extremely comfortable in your hands.  I was a little worried the triggers would feel less responsive when pressed but this isn't the case.  IMO, this is exactly the way the PS3 controller should have been made.
0061134007|5.0|During World War II, 300,000 German troops occupied Norway. The royal family fled Norway and remained in exile throughout the war. Many Norwegians supported German rule; there was the infamous collaborationist government of Vidkun Quisling.  An estimated fifteen thousand Norwegians joined or were forced into the German army and fought alongside German troops. Some forty thousand armed Norwegians resisted German occupation.    After the war, the resistors were glorified; those who supported the Germans were vilified, with many prosecuted by the post-war government. This novel by Jo Nesbo largely concerns a Norwegian who served in the German army.  Much of the book is set in 1999-2000 when he's in his seventies and is dying of cancer. He's very bitter about how he and others like him were treated after the war. He experienced brutal combat against the Soviets on the Eastern Front and feels he was fighting to defend Norway from Soviet occupation.     Oslo police detective Harry Hole is involved in the investigation of neo-Nazi activity and a possible assassination plot during the dawn of the new century. His investigation leads him to events half a century earlier in the 1940's.     The shift from the forties to the late nineties is somewhat confusing. There are also some confusing identity changes. But it is all written very well. I found that when I had to put the book down due to various commitments, I remained interested enough to return and soon again became absorbed in the story.     Hole seems similar to other Scandinavian detectives I have encountered in fiction land. Like Henning Mankell's  Kurt Wallender (Sweden) and Arnaldur Indridason's Erlender Sveinnson (Iceland), Hole is viewed  with little respect by society as something like a low/mid level bureaucrat who packs a gun. The pay is low, all three live in dumpy apartments; their cars are falling apart. They share a tenacious commitment to catching the bad guys. They are incorruptible.
0670022411|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book--it was exciting and suspenseful all the way through. I was, however, a little disappointed at the end because I thought the book was going to wrap up all of the questions that have been posed and didn't realize it was meant to be a series. With that said, I can't wait for the next book to come out.
B00466HN68|4.0|An army soldier is placed into the body of another man in order to attempt to stop a terrorist attack. The action alternates between the man trying to understand the mission, and the time he spends on the train. This is a riveting action drama, with a premise that is unlikely, but somehow is believable in the context presented. He develops a relationship with an attractive woman on the train, a friend of the man that he is pretending to be. He has to go back to the train several times, trying to figure out who the bomber is. Even if the bomber is identified, will he save everyone on the train, or have circumstances already predetermined their fate? The film's ending was disappionting, but overall this is solid work.
0756404738|5.0|One of the top five books of this year for me.<br />I read it in two days (a feat, considering English is not my native language) and wanted to reread it immediately after i had finished it, anything to stay longer in that world. What a great book to loose yourself in!<br />Lovely language full of delightful little pearls like \\"he was self-centered as a gyroscope\\", wonderful characters and enchanting, fast-moving story.<br /><br />Robert Jordan's books will have to move on my bookshelf to give room to a new fantasy Master. Hopefully there will be enough books by him to fill many more shelves...
B003K16P3M|5.0|This book is so great. I read this as a high school senior and found it both interesting and creative. I never got bored and I was disappointed when it ended. I read it about 3 times through and loved it every time. I ended up reading Fire by Cashore as well and found it to be just as engaging.
B004E2XAFW|5.0|These guys are getting better on every album.This cd is simply brilliant.I only have one complain.I bought the LTD version with the DVD,to expect this would be the ultimate version.Well ,there is one more with 3 bonus tracks.What is this,really if not unfair practice by the record company.Do as fans have to buy 2 versions of the album to have all the goodies????It is not fair.But the music itself is great .
1400052173|5.0|I don't know what to say other than that it's a fantastic story to read.  It's a sad story and it's hard to realize that it happened but it did.  You feel for her and her family.  I'll never forget her and her story.  Her childhood was no picnic and she had a good life and a hard life and it did not end well.  You've just got to read it.<br />I want to meet her daughter and give her a hug.  You end up rooting for her daughter and the author throughout their search for answers.
B003ITDN86|4.0|I've been listening to Sum 41 for  the past 9 years, and honestly I haven't been into their past two albums so much. It wasn't that they were worsening as musicians, they had actually matured a lot. I just wasn't feeling the connection between their songs and the passion they had for them like it seemed earlier. This album brings that passion back in such an epic way. Deryck has been through so much personally in the last year and I think it really shows in his lyrics. It's especially apparent in the tracks \\"Blood in my Eyes\\" and \\"What am I to Say\\". Overall this is a really solid album.
B0006Z2KYI|5.0|Ernst Lubitsch was one of the most talented and daring filmmakers of his generation. Accustomed to make provocative and fearless scripts, he achieved a honor place with this acidic and laughable comedy against the Nazis; specially when just two years ago Charles Chaplin had throwen his hat top ring with The Great Dictator and perhaps for many everything had been said aboiut this awful issue. Tha's why when Lubitsch assumed the task of directing the 1942 political satire classic To Be or Not to Be, the normal expectations turned around what was going on behind stage and the surprise was majuscule for crictics and audiences; the film  marked the final screen appearance of comedienne Carole Lombard. In Warsaw at the beginning of WWII, Maria Tura (Lombard) and husband Joseph (Jack Benny) perform anti-Nazi plays with their theater troupe until they are forced to switch to Shakespeare's Hamlet. Lt. Stanislav Sobinski (Robert Stack) falls for Maria and meets up with her during Joseph's famous \\"To Be or Not to Be\\" speech as Hamlet. When Stanislav is eventually dispatched for war, he implicates Maria with Professor Siletsky (Stanley Ridges), who has a secret plan to destroy the Warsaw resistance. The Polish theater troupe is then forced to use their theatrical skills to ensure their survival. Eventually, they turn to impersonating Nazi officers -- and even Hitler himself -- in order to outwit the enemy and keep the resistance safe from spies. To Be or Not to Be opened to a controversial release in 1942, when the U.S. was still very much involved in WWII.<br /><br />Watching it one may note why Mel Brooks bet for making The producers in 1968 and finally to undertake a remake in 1983.<br /><br />A timeless movie that has acquired a cult status among the most origianl exponents of its genre.

B000YABIQ6|5.0|This is the first season of the epic Mad Men series. I was hooked from the first episode. The characters are brilliant, the writing is brilliant, the acting is brilliant. Such a departure from the drivel on TV now-a-days. It's smart, it's funny, it's poignant. You'll be hooked from the start, believe me, and you'll be wanting more when the last scene is over with. I definitely suggest watching Seasons 2, 3, and 4. Too bad Season 5 will be delayed until early 2010. I don't know how I will survive!
B004LSJCJM|4.0|Seriously, I got a new sound system a few weeks ago because of this guy. Live at the Royal Albert on DVD is my all time fav. If I could only have one music DVD that would be it.<br /><br />He came to Dallas (where I live) just days before I happened to catch a DVR I made of a Guitar Center show. I was amazed how good he was! Where has this guy been?! I can not believe I missed him in Dallas! I am going to be at the next concert he does anywhere near Dallas.<br /><br />Dust bowl is good. Face it, Joe B. is simply the best out there today. But I like rock in my blues more, just like I like ice in my rum and coke zero.<br /><br />I have to say, The Whale that Swallowed Jonah is so good! Live at the Albert is still my favorite but some of the cuts on Dust Bowl are my style. Check it out and if you like blusey blues this is your cup! :)<br /><br />Keep Rocking, Joe B., we really love you!<br /><br />Ron
B003L77GVK|5.0|What is it with this country's movie industry? The better quality of the show, the more vulnerable it becomes to cancellation. I can't add anything to what the other reviewers have said, Stargate Universe was an excellent program, it will be missed along with the other sci fi shows in recent years that have met the same fate.<br /><br />It's been four years now since I posted this review for Stargate Universe, and I am still hoping against hope that someone will pick this up and revive it. Be that as it may, if you are looking for drama with depth, a sophisticated interaction among complex characters which as I said feeds the imagination and makes you think, then this is cinema for you. Yes, it has some shallow elements to draw those people who thrive on explosions and such, but for the most part, it's superb adult drama. For me, it's the best of the Stargate series, the culmination of Stargate's development. Yes, mistakes were made, but that happens in the development of anything. If you are a mature individual, buy this product, immerse yourself in it, and I promise, you will not be disappointed. Don't be fooled by those who got this great series cancelled because it didn't fulfill their shallow expectations. Get this series (the price is right) and judge for yourself. I am sure you will find, in the words of another reviewer, N. Kemp, &#34;By the time its run came to an end, it was at its peak. Kudos to the writers and the staff for such a fine show. Adult science fiction on TV took a hit with its cancellation&#34;.

B000TGCR38|4.0|I saw Paul Verhoeven's Black Book in the theatre(not to be confused with Little Black Book, a horrendous romantic comedy.) Paul Verhoeven is a director whose American portfolio includes such films as Basic Instinct, Starship Troopers, Robocop, Total Recall, and the truly horrible Showgirls. None of these films are particularly good, and all seem to share a common theme of excessive violence, of excessive sex, or a combination of both.    I was astonished to learn that Verhoeven has directed two movies that are considered the greatest Dutch films of the twentieth century: Soldier of Orange, and Turkish Delight. While the plot synopsis of Turkish Delight does not appeal to me, Soldier of Orange, the story of students involved in the Dutch resistance, does. I hope to see that movie some day.    Black Book was of particular interest to me because it deals with the Dutch Resistance during World War II. Being of Dutch extraction, and being a student of history, I was excited about seeing this movie. My excitement was tempered by a certain anxiousness. What would Verhoeven do? Would there be any resemblance of actual historical events, or would it be an excuse for bloody shoot-outs and mindless sex?  In the end, I was neither satisfied nor disappointed. The movie begins with the words \\"based on actual events\\" which, in the film world, is code for \\"we dressed everybody old-fashioned and then made up a story.\\" The movie does a fine job in recreating the war-time Netherlands (I think), but the fictional characters do not correspond to any Dutch reality. The film is poignant at times, while at other times it is so over the top it borders on ridiculous. There is a lot of violence, which is to be expected in a movie dealing with a clash between the resistance and the Nazis. There is also a lot of nudity, which is, for the most part, completely unnecessary.    Carrice Van Houten plays Rachel Stein, a Jewish woman in hiding. Circumstances force her out of hiding and into the resistance. Further events lead her to befriend the German SD officer, Ludwig Müntze whom she initially uses for information but later falls in love with. I had a difficult time with the idea that a Dutch Jew could have possibly fallen for any Nazi, no matter how sympathetic, during this dark period of history. I myself could not build up any positive feeling towards Müntze, a man who presumably would have served Nazism to the end if it had been successful.  Perhaps this is just due to my own bias, however. The film follows Rachel Stein's trials and tribulations right through to the liberation of the Netherlands.    Despite the problems I had with this movie, I still consider it to be very well-done. While it often seemed forced to me, it packs an emotional punch. The dark underbelly of the resistance is shown in all of its ugly glory. Van Houten's performance is superb, the story is intense, and many of the characters are intriguing. Verhoeven's often heavy hand succeeds in sculpting a work of true merit.
B0041KKYEM|5.0|No art criticism here, I'll only say that Black Swan was my favorite film of 2010.  The point of this review is for a technical problem concerning the DVD version I purchased over this last weekend.  I am convinced there was an extended sequence in the theatrical version, that I saw in December (Arclight Hollywood), that is missing from the DVD!  Right after the mirror shard stabbing of her other \\"self\\", and the first sounds of the \\"Black Swan breathing\\", there was a sequence where Natalie Portman leaves her dressing room and approaches the stage through a series of hallways, eventually walking right up to her stage entrance, all the while, giving any dancers or crew members who might notice, a sinister, sexy smile from her newly developed confidence.  From there, she takes the stage for the first time as the Black Swan from behind the parting glass partitions and THAT is where the DVD version picks back up.  It is the only missing footage!  It is the only difference from the cut I saw in the theater!    Has anyone else noticed this?

B003TSEL7S|5.0|I was both skeptical and interested when I saw that The Lost Hero was an extension of the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series.  I really enjoyed Percy Jackson and I was afraid that this series might jump the shark, so to speak.  But Riordan has done an excellent job of creating new characters while ensuring that they don't usurp the place of the old.  I highly recommend this book!
B0000033OT|5.0|After I purchased this the other night I listened to it on the car ride home. Musically it was such an experience to absorb that I actually had to give it a second listen before I could fully comprehend what I was hearing. Over the years I've heard about what a classic this album was and sort of ignored it because that word is thrown about far too much for it's own good as we all know. So after listening to it that second time I have to say the word classic flat out isn't enough to describe this album. It truely is the work of someone whose musical mind was,isn't and probably isn't to fully be understood. A Howard University graduate Hathaway had been working up to this album since the mid 60's and featuring a band consisting of some of Chi-Towns best musicians in soul and jazz such as Phil Upchurch,Louis Satterfield and sax players King Curtis and future EWF mainstay Don Myrick this album managed to create something incredible and often mind bending.<br /><br />  Years before the term neo soul was ever coined Donny Hathaway was on the forefront of all of it. Having absorbed just about every genre the city had to offer in the day from jazz,R&B,gospel,blues and the newer subgenre of funk Donny decided to explore all of it at the same time in songs that really baught to mind the musical and lyrical themes are emotional release and expression that all these genres shared and how they were connected. So therefore the album could not be more appropriately titled. The music is abound with some intense,revered lines on Donny's trademark Fender Rhodes electric piano and rhythms of all different sides. \\"Voices Inside (Everything Is Everything)\\" and \\"Sugar Lee\\" are both raw,bluesy late 60's style jazz-funk also featuring the musicians talking in the backround. He also provides three cover songs. Ray Charles' \\"I Believe To My Soul\\" really draws out the songs heavy gospel/blues hybrid while Errol Garner's \\"Misty\\" and Nina Simone's \\"To Be Young,Gifted And Black\\" all receive appropriately jazzy treatments.<br /><br />  \\"Je Vous Amie\\" and \\"Thank You Master (For My Soul)\\" are pure Atlantic style gospel soul ballads somewhat in the vein of Aretha. On the latter his distressed mental state does come out to some degree but as a message to the people;while singing of his faith he also adds that \\"the walls of my room are not the walls of my grave\\",a statement that impacted heavily on me in particular in it's statement of independence from the demands of the world around him and how people with a different way of thinking can be ignored and misunderstood. Now \\"Tryin' Times\\" and \\"The Ghetto\\" are a different matter altogether. On the former we have a bluesy R&B stomper more blatantly illustrating the social ills of the time in a more classic blues tradition and on the latin infused funky soul of \\"The Ghetto\\" you basically hear sounds-people taking,babies crying and that's all it really needs to say. The bonus track on this album is...well if the proceeding tracks were incredible this one almost defies description. \\"A Dream\\",an cinamatic,almost operation jazzy soul piece with really no tempo at all it features Hathaway on some incredible scaling vocals and cosmically poetic lyrical imagry. So it's true what everyone said:people both in and outside of the R&B community should've paid more attention to this man's outreaching approch when he was around.

B0028IDXDS|5.0|We got this for our son thinking that it would help him learn how to put his paci in sooner (which it did help) but shortly after purchasing this he gave up his paci and refuses to take it. :( In the short few weeks that we used it, it was great! Plus, it's harder to lose because it's bigger.
B004DSX5B6|4.0|The only other multi-tool I've owned is an [[ASIN:B000MF7N3A SOG Specialty Knives & Tools S61-N EOD PowerLock]].  While I like my PowerLock, I wanted something that was lighter, smaller, and more convenient, and this fits the bill.  It's only about an ounce lighter than the SOG, but it's nearly an inch shorter, which makes it easier to carry around.  More importantly, having all the tools accessible on the outside is much more convenient than the PowerLock.  Both have a locking mechanism, which I consider a necessity, but this is one area where the Gerber comes short.  Unlike the PowerLock's gentle but effective lever and flat spring, the Gerber has a sliding lock with a compression coil spring.  It's stiff and can rub your fingers raw with overuse, and I worry about how well it will hold up with age.  While the Gerber doesn't have the range of tools of the PowerLock, it does have the most important ones.  The flat Phillips head screwdriver doesn't look impressive, but it's worked when I needed it.  I haven't tried the combined can opener/bottle opener yet, which is the other one I think looks iffy.    Others have pointed out that this is identical to the Gerber Suspension Butterfly.  There's at least one difference, in that it has a rubberized grip rather than the open one of the other Gerber tool, which I consider an improvement.  It may also have better weatherization, as other reviewers have noticed that it seems less prone to rusting than other Gerber tools, but that's anecdotal, so I can't be sure of this.  In any case, the price was lower when I bought it, so the cost differential was considerably less. It's a good tool, overall, and I've found it worth the price.

B004SQS9FA|5.0|I am not a typical Radiohead Fan. I don't like some of their most acclaimed albums. Having said that, with the exception of the song Feral, this album is a masterpiece. I've listened to it with for weeks straight now, and can't stop. There are no choruses, verses, or any typical song structures here. In this regard, King of Limbs reminds me of a Post-Rock album. Tom's voice is just another instrument. I'm very happy with the direction Radiohead are taking. If their typical fan-base isn't on board, fine. New listeners, like me, will be.
B003U0AHBO|5.0|This is not a simple remake of the beloved Robin Hood film starring Errol Flynn. This is a gritty, fresh reinterpretation of that classic tale.  While Flynn's movie was a family film told with the innocence of a childhood fable, this version is a realistic portrayal of medieval life and warfare. I loved the scene where even in the house of a rich noble, the country mice scrambled over the leftovers on the table, with one actually dangling over the side of the fruit bowl as Robin and his father sat chatting mere feet away. Genius! The battle scenes were also starkly real. When King Richard laid siege to the castle we see how the foot soldiers struggled in the muck to advance only a few feet in every attack, and just how cheap life was in war. Best of all was the invasion. It was reminiscent of the famous beach landing scenes in Saving Private Ryan. Action movie fans will not be disappointed!   This story is much more adult than any other version, and much more intricate, with a complicated plot full of exciting twists and political intrigue. The characters are also much more deeply developed.  Russell Crowe's performance is under-stated, and yet his character dominates the screen. You can't stop yourself from rooting for him. Cate Blanchett also gives a remarkable performance as the strong-willed Lady Marion. You can read the emotion on her face as her feelings for Robin change from reluctance to acceptance to admiration and to desire.  The only flaw in this entire film was that it fell victim to the thought police, who insist on re-writing the roles of women in history to fit their ideology. Despite the fact that the film portrays Lady Marion as a strong-willed and self-reliant, capable woman, they still felt it was necessary for this audience for her to show up at the battlefield dressed in chain mail and helmet, and attack her father's killer. This of course forced Robin Hood to ride to her rescue to save her...in slow motion. This soap opera scene almost spoileda superb movie, the best of the year!
B003UESJHO|4.0|what interested me in this movie was the development of welter-weight fighter \\"Irish Micky Ward\\" within the tight circle of his family, especially with his older brother Dickey (Christian Bale). This blue collar Lowell Massachusetts family, seemingly under the authoritarian matriarch Alice, is both tight-knit as well as dysfunctional. The older son, Dickey, once had a claim to fame as \\"The Pride of Lowell\\" years ago when he went up against Sugar Ray Leonard, possibly knocking him down (or did he slip?), yet ultimately lost to him. Dickey never seems to be able to move past this moment in his life, constantly referring to it, and he is now so hopelessly mired in a crack addiction that he is of no use to brother or even to himself. Mom doesn't want to see the truth of this, and insists that Dickey and only Dickey should train Micky, and even Micky seems to believe this. (the group of five (!) sisters) form a \\"Greek chorus\\" of supporters; it's weird, everyone seems to live through Micky). Truth is, as much as they love each other, his family is bringing him down.    I think there is an undercurrent of rivalry between the two boys, as Dick who was a competent fighter and taught Micky everything he knew could never let go of the fact that he was \\"almost great\\", and when Micky followed in his footsteps, Dickey taught and encouraged him, yet at the same time seemed focused on himself. I was left to wonder if he truly DID want Micky to win, or if he was subconsciously afraid of being upstaged by his little brother.  Micky, for his part, wants to imitate and surpass his brother's success.     Christian Bale, gaunt and hyper, is quite convincing as the troubled Dick Eklund. Dick has a young son who appears to live with Alice (everyone appears to live with Alice). So he is not much of a father. Also derelict in his work attendance, he turns to crime to support his crack habit. Eventually this lifestyle catches up with him, and he is imprisoned (again), and painfully dries outfrom the drugs while incarcerated.     During this time, Micky has the opportunity to take on a new, more reliable trainer and manager, but they insist that Micky leave his family out of the business. Micky also makes a girlfriend in feisty barmaid Charlene Fleming (Amy Adams), although his fam does not approve. The heart of the movie is how Micky learns to choose for himself what is best for his own life and career, yet, in the end also to honor his family. He manages to move forward and win many fights while Dick is in prison. A big moment of conflict at the end is whether he will follow through with the plans that his trainer taught him in the big fight for World Champion in England, or whether he will follow his brother's advice with a most unusual game plan. This shows how he has finally matured as a fighter and as a person to be able to think and choose for himself.

006112429X|4.0|I'd read that this book was pretty good and as someone with an interest in school shootings - I was present when my alma mater had one - I didn't need to be sold on checking this book out. This review contains spoilers. Seriously. I spoil the ending.    This must be noted immediately, as it is a problem apparent right from the start and never lets up: Shriver's vocabulary is incredibly pretentious. I don't know why her editor allowed so many uselessly huge words to litter the text, but nobody saw fit to change this. Unless the impractically large words were a literary device to illustrate how obnoxious the narrator is, there was no need for this.    I have read reviews that indicate the reader did not like the book specifically because the protagonist, Eva, was unlikeable. I don't think that's fair. Just because you don't like the character, it doesn't automatically mean she was poorly developed or unrealistic. I didn't too much love Eva, but I don't think I needed to. Her underlying motivation is to decide whether or not she is responsible for her son Kevin's murderous rampage and whether you like her or not is irrelevant in my opinion. Eva is a supercilious glutton for punishment who makes poor choices regarding what's best for her family, her marriage, herself, and her children. It's sort of an ironic parody of the typical self-absorbed, self-satisfied wealthy white woman. It is unclear whether Shriver's true goal is to make you hate or sympathize with Eva.     The recurring focus on other school shootings feels like a misstep. It feels contrived for the purposes of the plot (some of the incidents seem fictional while others, like Columbine, obviously are not) and takes away from the climax of Kevin's shooting. She over-saturated the story with them.    Shriver is asking whether nature or nurture is responsible for the monster that is Kevin. My biggest issue with this book is that this entire premise, which the novel hinges itself on, is irrelevant. It doesn't work because right from the start it is plainly apparent that Kevin is a horrible little a-hole and nothing could have fixed that. The problem is that Kevin, and the other child Celia, are presented from birth with unrealistically preordained personalities. There is no room for nurture to have a hand in the way Eva's children turn out because from birth they have such exaggeratedly pronounced personality traits. While theoretically it may be possible that Eva is an unreliable narrator and the truth was that her reactions to Kevin shaped him from birth, the tertiary characters disprove this - even as an infant Kevin was perceived by everyone around him (nannies, baby sitters, neighbors, teachers, classmates) as unpleasant and disturbed. You can't ask whether a child could have turned out differently when you make it clear from the start that the child has always had these traits and nothing anyone did to intervene changed them. Part of this flaw is probably due to the fact that Shriver herself has no children. I don't either, but I have still observed enough to know that children don't have fixed personalities this way, especially at such a young age.    Kevin's evil nature is extremely pronounced and unavoidable. When he unexpectedly begins to speak at age three - in full sentences - I half expected him to laugh maniacally, exposing pointed white teeth and rolling around matching white eyes, and run madly around the room with demonic speed and strength. It just doesn't make sense to base the entire theme around the question of nature or nurture when the character is inescapably depicted as a bad seed. There is no ambiguity.    While some view the character of Celia as a deliberately manipulative means to pull the heartstrings, I enjoyed her function in the plot. It is heart wrenching to think of such a sweet, harmless little girl being hurt. And despite Eva's constant expressions of love for her husband Franklin, he is so stubbornly deluded about Kevin that you almostwant him to suffer his comeuppance. I definitely did not see the \\"twist\\" at the end, and while I do think the previous language describing them IS manipulative in order to conceal this twist, I think it works.      Apart from these criticisms, this reveal is one of the most (if not THE most) redeeming factors about the book because it forces you to question everything before it and allows for many more interpretations about Kevin's evilness. There is little question what a monster Kevin is when you know the full extent of what he did, seemingly just to leave Eva alive to suffer. It also suggests that Kevin's motive for the shooting is simply that he knows his mother doesn't love him (so as extra punishment, he kills the people she DOES love) and he's taken the petulance of \\"acting out\\" too far. This extra step of cruelty vindicates the feelings Eva has had all along and makes the big question of \\"why\\" a lot simpler - Kevin's just a hateful, murderous a-hole. There is no big philosophical reason. Kevin is an angry, privileged little a-hole whose sense of cultural entitlement went so far that it allowed him to take the lives of others because he felt he could, the same as any other school shooter.     It also justifies some of the other problems I had, such as why Shriver chose to keep Kevin odiously, frustratingly alive when most of these kids commit suicide, or why Eva doesn't simply write the kid off to rot instead of seeking his approval/understanding/abuse/whatever. You want him to die because he is so heinous but now you think having to live with himself - who is the person he really hates the most - is the greatest punishment of all. It was simply a clever and well-done twist that successfully achieves greater depth for both Eva and Kevin. Before this I'd almost decided the novel was self indulgent and meaningless, particularly when Shriver directly allows Kevin the opportunity to explain his motives and he not only spouts a bunch of crap but Shriver cuts himoff for no reason in the story because as the writer she was out of stupid excuses and didn't really know what she was trying to say. But I think making Kevin not only a school shooter but a kid who murdered his loving father and sister was a great reveal allowing for more thought on human nature instead of on niche psychos.     While I'd have preferred more punishment for Kevin in the end, there was really no way for this story to have a happy ending, and as such is life. Shriver told a harrowing tale and whether you love it or hate it, it's one that will stick with you.
030746363X|5.0|For ANY exercise enthusiast<br /><br />My good friend had this book on his desk and suggested that I read this. I was skeptical. I am a skeptic in general. I have run 12 marathons and have competed in triathlons having placed in Ironman distance events. I had climbed alpine routes and have trained for years. I have read many academic books on exercise physiology and training guides from established runners - what could this book possibly offer?<br /><br />Think and think again. It is simply awesome. I guess that at the time of this writing a few don't have as high as an approval rating as mine (there are 64 1's) but I think I am able to judge a book on exercise more than many - it has a lot to offer, and if you don't but it, a lot to think about and test in training. I was a skeptic. Did I mention that I am one?<br /><br />Kettle bells? Ahh - bunch of bull hey! Well, I bought a few and swing each day now. Despite having trained for over 20 years regularly I have only recently learned some of my favorite exercises. From this book. Sure - you may need to go out of your comfort zone, you may need to sacrifice the goodies in life (not the real goodies), and you may need to learn how to do some exercises (i.e. the Turkish Get-Up) but after you give it a go - I think you will agree that there is something in this for all.<br /><br />If not, you will have something interesting to discuss. We need not all agree with all aspects of this book - but I think it would be hard pressed for you to find nothing of value. It is a unique spin on what is traditionally exercised. If you are an exercise junkie, but it!!

B003ITDN86|5.0|Sum 41 screaming bloody murder comes at you like a runaway freight train. Its loud, fast, feroucious and punk. Songs are catchy hooks are sweet and stick in your head. Its a great album. If you like Sum 41's previous efforts you wont be disappointed. Its different in a good way. Its in tune to now and all songs kick major ass!

B004RJMUJO|5.0|I have a Droid X as well, and this game is rockin'. My guess is anyone with a Droid X having FC issues or lag doesn't know how to use their phone properly. I have over 100 apps on my phone and this game is still super smooth with great graphics. Learn to use your phones, ya tards. Rooted Droid X.
B004SBS8LA|3.0|Won't load on my Garmin-Nuvi.  Incredibly slow on my Novel 7, and most graphics don't even load.  Certain levels bog down my HTC Expresso (T-mobile my slide 3g).  Still, it's a fun game and some of the levels are challenging enough to make you upset!
B003IKMR0U|5.0|This game is great! After playing it with some people I met in line at PAX, I had to pick it up. It's simple enough for anyone to pick up, and it mainly involves risk/reward.  Even my mom wants a set now (not sure if that's a good or bad thing).
B0041KKYEM|2.0|Black Swan has surreal qualities going for it, the kind of elements found in Bunel and Losey. Very quickly,however, the film dips into the obvious, and, here,a very thin consdieration of good vs evil takes over in an MTV manner.Stock mother vs. daughter scenes,tired out lesbian scenes,and other sexual disorientations, and a finale that is patently obvious and boring.    Portman is alright, but for her to win and Academy Award over Ms. Annette Benning or Ms. Nicole Kidman is outrageous,but not as bad as those no talent people from the really terrible film, The Fighter. Also consider Rese Witherspoon, Halle Berry, Julia Roberts etc etc. nothing new.    Ms. Portman accepted her award with humility, and she needed to. But later on, in her interviews with the press, she described the ending of Black Swan as a development of the ballerina into maturity, leaving the old life behind.    Did she see the film I saw? But here again, Portman herself perhaps(I cannot say) sensed the deep -at -the surface artiface of the \\"project\\", and inadvertantly(again perhaps) exposed it in her inattention to the role she played right up to the conclusion,even to the point where she made her incredible interpretation of the ending public.    See The Kids Are Alright and Rabitt Hole with Ms. Benning and Ms. Kidman respectively. It's art we want, not craft.
B003AWRMCE|5.0|What is there left to say that has not already been said about this wonderful piece of work. Eastwood has always been great but seems to improve as he gets older. Beautiful scenery, great acting, Eastwood and Freeman in the same movie, a delight.
B003EV6DBM|5.0|I really liked both the 9th and 10th Doctors, and really didn't think I was going to like the 11th Doctor- Matt Smith. But after a few episodes, I started to get his style. At least watch until \\"Amy's Choice\\" or \\"Vincent and the Doctor\\" before passing final judgment. Yes, there are a few sub-par episodes, but in my opinion there are some in each season. My only small complaint is that I really don't see that Rory has any purpose. Oh well, I thought that about Micky, and look what happened there.
B001TOD92C|2.0|I love wrestling, both what goes on inside and I love to read about what goes on on the outside. But personally I found this to be very boring and very depressing. Sure there's a great deal of truth to it I'm sure but I guess this just made everything a little too real for my liking. So I just didn't like it, that's all there is to it.
