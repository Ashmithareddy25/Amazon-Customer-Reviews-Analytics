B008Y1YKE4|5.0|My daughter and I loved this DVD. I think this is going to be a classic for her. Enjoyed the message in the movie, the jokes, and the accents. We saw it in theaters last winter and bought it as soon as it was released on DVD. She has watched the DVD almost daily for the last 3 weeks.
B0095R64AO|1.0|I so wanted to love this movie since I love Jason Segal and Emily Blunt but it was horrible.  It wasn't even funny and it's called the Five-Year Engagement but it  should be called What Not to Do in a Relationship.
B008WCP2PG|4.0|I loved the dancing and the muscles, but I thought the story was lacking. I enjoyed finally having a movie where men are dancing instead of women. Channing Tatum's body is amazing.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|I rarely buy DVD's knowing that I usually watch movies once and move on. This series is so entertaining I decided to buy both seasons after enjoying them repeatedly on my DVR. The bonus that I did not consider were the extras such as episode commentary and something called Sherlock Uncovered on this set that I have yet to see. I was never a big fan of the previous incarnations of the sleuth and his trusty Dr. Watson but am totally entertained by this irreverent, aggravating, fascinating reincarnation as embodied by the mesmerizing Benedict Cumberbatch as Holmes and Martin Freeman, the long-suffering yet adorable Dr. Watson. Great fun!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a great game for all ages. My 6 year old daughter and 70 year old grandmother both love playing it. Easy, fun, and addicting!!!
B004132HZS|5.0|My DVR has seasons one and two of this fabulous new look at the Sherlock Holmes phenomenon with all the high tech gadgets and smart putdowns. They are one of the few things I re-watch from time to time. After worrying that my recorder might fill up and knowing that I really would watch these episodes again, I took the plunge and bought both seasons. Feeling slightly guilty I pulled out season one to watch and noticed I could watch it with commentary. Hurrah! Such interesting background information on how this series came to be, shoot locations, casting, etc. Then I discovered the second disc contained the one hour pilot (the episodes are 90 minutes now) with quite a few differences. Even at an hour you could feel the excitement of something working so well, particularly the chemistry between the nearly-insufferable genius, Sherlock, played superbly by Benedict Cumberbatch and the dependable Dr. Watson, played with exactly the right amount of aggravation and tolerance by Martin Freeman.
B0087HT36U|4.0|Except for the 3 that are impossible due to the starting delay in the discovery age, this game is better than angry birds. I hope they come up with the cowboy age games soon (and fix those three).
B006GWO5NE|2.0|You have a cable with nothing on either end.  It would need nice if the USB connection had an outlet/power adapter.
B009VB97EY|4.0|This is a good movie. Channing sure can move, and he is the one who makes the movie a good movie.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I love games that make you think and are not too easy, even my three year old is enjoying it.
B009NPKTN6|4.0|I think this movie is pretty good. They have a lot of songs on it so if you really like to hear older songs you will like this DVD
B008KW43TE|5.0|Great album with a classic feel. There is not a single weak track on this album. Give it a listen and then support Frank Ocean and buy it.
B008R14YBK|5.0|When I first heard the single, Ready Or Not, I didn't really like it. Being familiar with Bridgit from Good Luck Charlie and knowing how she talks, it was weird to hear her sing this sound like a Jamaican or something. However, the song really grew on me. And in the same way, the songs that make up Hello My Name Is...are sure to grow on you too! She really showcases her range as an artist. I recommend this album!
B001CTGQBK|5.0|Awesome!!! Movie!  I would recommend this to everyone! I ordered it for my 14 year old granddaughter. She loves all the songs on it.
B009LK6JS2|4.0|Can't complain about this because I got it for free...wish it had some shooting/fighting action, though. Good tutorials even though landing is more difficult than I would have imagined...I die waaayyyy too much!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I am a really great fan of country and this is my great kind of app. And you can make your own village and shoot other amimals. It is sort of like a thanksgiving day game.
0393088774|5.0|Krugman needs to be hired by President Obama to lead his Economic counsel. His ideas just make sense and are already proven by history!
B009NQKPUW|4.0|The aesthetics and visual effects of this movie were awesome to behold - and we would expect nothing less of Ridley Scott.  Truly stunning to watch.  As a prequel, this movie lacks the character development and general plot quality that would put it in the company of the other films in the 'Alien' series.  Not all that I expected it to be, but entertaining and fun.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|The app is very easy to use and intuitive as to how to operate. My Acer 100 did not have a decent file managing app as part of its preinstalled programs.
B001NHJTKG|5.0|Apart from the three most popular songs here (title track aside), this album is packed with gems that really transport the listener. Blues and jazz influences are present and mix well with the sense of melody and contemplative lyrics.
B0096Y6EUG|5.0|Paul performs enthusiastically like he just released every song.  Sound was great. Wish I could of been there. Loved it!
B008FSCNTK|2.0|I am a huge Krall fan and own most everything she has recorded and have attended her live concerts but this has to be her worst outing ever. Bonnie Raitt might have salvaged a couple of these uninteresting songs as they suit her style much better but this largely obscure material works against Krall's strengths and the basis of her popularity. I loved the jazzy style of When I Look In Your Eyes and the velvet smoothness of Russell Malone's superior guitar contributions to that album. In contrast, Marc Ribot on guitar particularly on electric guitar has a grating quality that had the hair on my arms standing up and not in a good way. If you like the Diana Krall you thought you knew, skip this one. I listened a couple times through, hit the next track button frequently and then gave it away. Its that bad, honest. This is like Tony Bennett backed by The Clash doing a Willie Nelson tribute albumn, very out of character. T-Bone makes Krall into chopped liver here.
B007UWBQEU|5.0|Great price compared to iTunes Store. A terrific collection for true Carrie Underwood fans. She never stops getting better. I love it.
B004ZJZPXO|5.0|There probably isn't much point to writing a review for this movie, because if you like Firefly, then you already know you'll like this movie. Same actors, same characters, same Whedon awesomeness. If you're a Browncoat and you haven't seen/don't own this movie, buy it now.<br /><br />For those of you who have no idea what I'm talking about, this isn't the movie for you - yet. &#34;Serenity&#34; follows the events of the TV show &#34;Firefly,&#34; building on plots and characters introduced there. If you watch this movie without having seen Firefly, you're going to be very confused (I'm speaking from personal experience here). It's still a great movie, but you want to check out the show, first. Still just as awesomely geeky, but not intended for people who already know what's going on.
1451675046|5.0|Dawkins does what he does best, use simple science to explain what is known through scientific inquiry. The line is drawn between knowledge and belief, between myths and reality. This book should be accessible by high school students and non science types. When you are ready to face the fact that the easter bunny and the tooth fairy are not real its time to read this book.
B004EPYZQ2|5.0|This is one of the few movies that successfully combines suspense and comedy. The story is great, the special effects are superb, and the characters are engaging. Great movie!
B002DD67XG|5.0|Great songwriter and decent performer, James Taylor's classic hits should be in all Boomers collections.  I couldn't believe I could get the album for $5!
0525953728|5.0|not a military secrets story or a super-heros tale but an inside sight of a world many times described or pictured from media a lot different......true Pros doing their job at the best with the reward of self pride and sharing it with your comrades.... for serious people and for sunday warriors to learn how real world people act, just as Giulius Caesar's &#34;de Bello Gallico&#34;
B003NGTYPA|5.0|Quality and price were both exceptional! A lovable, timeless classic my family and I always enjoy year after year.  A perfect way to kick off the holiday season!

B000VOC90Y|4.0|I liked this backpack, and it fits my 17.3 inch laptop, but it does get a little snug on the edges of the back when zipping it up. And there are for sure a lot of zippers on this bag. There's two zippers on each pocket of the bag. Other than that, the bag is great, durable, and can hold huge amounts of stuff. Well worth the price!
B007Y6OZE0|1.0|I am terribly disappointed in this purchase.  When I made the selection, this CD was not marked as an explicit version.  When it arrived in the mail, it was labeled as explicit.  I went back on the site to see if I had missed the label previously when I had ordered, and it still was not labeled as explicit.  I did scroll down much further on page and saw that Amazon.com offered a clean version.  This was not clear to me at the time of purchase.  As a result, I have a CD in my drawer that I am not comfortable listening to.  Unfortunately, the CD was seal was broken prior to realizing that the CD was explicit.  However, no on has listened to the CD at any time.<br /><br />I do wish the labeling on the order page had been clearer.  This money for me is now wasted.  I am presently unemployed so my budget is tighter than ever before.
B000HF6XV8|5.0|Every child should see this movie. Remembered loving<br />It as a kid.. Still holds true today. Beautiful imagery!<br />A great family film!
B008G12ERC|5.0|This is my first Muse CD, and I love it.  I had heard the first three songs prior to purchase and enjoyed them.  Now, I like all of the songs on the CD.
B0055PMJMW|4.0|Connelly is one of my favorite authors along with his character, Harry Bosch.  I look forward to his next book.
0756405890|2.0|This book is just good enough to keep you reading (mostly to justify the purchase price), but it never overcomes its two biggest flaws.<br /><br />First, as many have said, the main character is extremely unlikable, and even more frustrating, is seemingly liked and admired by everyone in the book's universe. Apparently no one in the book's world ever gets tired of arrogance or lack of a sense of humor.<br /><br />Second, the author overuses the contrived plot device of the main character narrating his own story. If I had to read another condescending sentence where the author, through the main character, tells me \\"If you have never done ____ (insert whatever), then you can't possibly understand how it feels.\\" Literally dozens of sentences like this exist in the book and it gets very old, very fast. I'm reading a book; I EXPECT you to describe how ____ feels, not for you to conveniently write your way around doing it.<br /><br />Some parts of the book are interesting (the magic system especially has great potential), but I will definitely not subject myself to reading the rest of the series. Had I known that this book basically serves as a very long introduction to the series, I would have skipped it entirely.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I almost stopped reading half way through.  Although it is very poorly written it kept my interest. I would not recommend this book.
B007JVJ3C4|1.0|I hate to waste money and this movie was a waste. If you watched the previews for it then you essentially seen the whole movie including the ending.
B0049VVE7Y|5.0|Got hooked on this show,when I watched it with my son. Very exciting and chilling.Highly recommended series to watch. Great cliffhangers.
B007I1TFK0|5.0|After Jesus Christ SuperStar, this is the only great adaptation of Webber-Rice musicals, even they use some material from the original concept album, and writte a new song for the production.<br />Madonna is perfect for the role, because everybody knows the star, even in a countries where the musicals its not part of their culture, the choose of Madonna makes that every body can enjoy this  great musical. great direction and production!
B005RUV0NY|5.0|This season keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting to see what happens next. Exciting and bone chilling.Some unexpecting activity.
B000V86OKG|5.0|Saving up for all the series to date and will have a Dexter marathon. Ahhh the things of which nightmares are made.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|This show has always been great and continues to be with it's newest season four. Bryan Cranston is great to watch as well.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Catching up with the beginnings of the show in order to seat in my memory things past. Sometimes reliving a good show is justified in itself
B0084IG8TM|5.0|I loved the book series and the movie was great too. I love all the extra features included as well.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Excellent series, hated it to end. I would recommend it to teans and adults as well. Hope you enjoy this book
B002NLY0V4|5.0|Season 5 is one of my favs! I think its one of the best seasons in the series so far, along with 3 and 1
B0000028UK|5.0|No, not really. People on here have done a better job than me, so I'll just toss in my agreement that this is a great album. I really enjoyed \\"Ten\\" and I heard this album was quite a bit different. I was worried I wouldn't like it, so I bought it used for just under three bones shipped. I got it today and I've listened to it three times through. Normally albums don't grab my attention like this one and I don't listen to them all the way through until I've listened to the first half a few times. I listened to this album three times today since I pulled it out of my mailbox. This is a great album, even better considering the price I paid.
B005AERS74|3.0|Not my favorite Maroon 5 album but it was a good Black Friday mp3 deal. There are still a few good songs that'll get stuck in your head.
B007TXN4TK|3.0|Could use a few more instructions on how to play.  Thats why it only got 3 stars. Don't know it I would order it again.
B007IQX1G4|1.0|It's two hours of my life that I'll never get back. Pointless, senseless, mean-spirited; and it's suppose to be a comedy?
B009WO7NQO|4.0|fun game.  Have only played a few days but like the challenge.<br /><br />Would like the original Angry Birds. Would deffinatly order more Angry Bird games.
B003XQM2YU|4.0|This is an interesting pre-quel to the well known Robin Hood saga. It establishes how Robin Hood became an outlaw
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I just read this for the third time.  That alone should tell you something.  I have bought innumerable \\"epic fantasy\\" Kindle books from Amazon, and I have come to find that the rating system is woefully inflated.  \\"4 out of 5 stars\\" means little.  I suspect that the system is skewed by young readers with no taste.<br /><br />Regardless, this one is rated \\"5 stars\\" for a reason - it's a standout in a genre full of mediocrity.  I would guess that 90% of the plots you find in this genre could be described by \\"Prophesied Chosen One Triumphing Against Ultimate Evil With Much Strife and Despair On the Way.\\"  While you might call the main character, Vaelin Al Sarna, something of a \\"Prophesied Chosen One,\\" and there's much \\"Strife and Despair\\" along the way, this book never wallows in it like most do.  The much-beleaguered hero always seems to retain some semblance of dignity, and, more importantly, his wits.<br /><br />In short, this is one of the finest books of its type.  I would rate this as good or better than anything Brian Sanderson, a top author in this field, could pull off.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|A group of English pensioners decide to spend their retirement years in India. From the start, they encounter the unexpected.

B009329ZF2|4.0|the movie is OK. I like Peter Berg as a director. The movie is cornie but fun to watch. It was worth the rental cost. It should have been in 3d.

B008AK8FHM|5.0|The title of this book drew me in due to the subject matter,<br />Near Death Experiences.<br />As we age, I think we all wonder what it might be like<br />in the 'here-after'.<br />The fact that the author is a Neuro Surgeon, with years<br />of experience based upon science made his perspective<br />especially intriguing.<br />I enjoyed his writing style and his detail very much.  I came away<br />with a comforted feeling about what death might be like.
B002HK9IDQ|5.0|Much has been said over the years regarding the turn of events that led to Audrey Hepburn playing cockney flower girl Eliza Doolittle instead of Julie Andrews--who sung the role on stage.  Despite the nearly universal acknowledgement that the role was better suited to Andrews, I still find this movie thoroughly enjoyable!<br /><br />My favorite scene is where the verbally reformed Eliza is first presented to society--at the opening of the races at Ascot.  Here Miss Hepburn is wearing the dress shown on the cover of this DVD.  In this scene she is just incredibly beautiful, as this dress provides just the right accent for her elegant figure!  My wife observed that this dress brought to mind some of the better efforts from Project Runway (for example [[ASIN:B009TJ1Q6K Finale, Part II [HD]]]).  I also enjoyed her character's amusing efforts to blend upper class manners with cockney wit!<br /><br />Another element of this movie that I found interesting is the origin of the story itself.  As the stage musical was inspired by George Bernard Shaw's play Pygmalion, it is interesting to note that Shaw's character Henry Higgins was based, to some degree, upon the Oxford philologist Henry Sweet (1845-1912), whose specialty included the study of Old English (see Sweet's famous book [[ASIN:B003IMKOU8 An Anglo-Saxon Primer with Grammar, Notes, and Glossary (Eighth Edition, Revised - 8th)]], Old Norse, and the use of phonetics in transcribing modern dialects.  Evidently, Henry Sweet was infamously irascible--and to such a degree, that by comparison, Henry Higgins would seem to be steeped in the social graces!
B009IJJB8G|5.0|Great show, hope they don't cancel it. Like they do a lot of good shows. It's full of good intriguing drama instead of the usual Jerry Springer drama you see today.
B000L53D4O|4.0|as new parents, it's hard to know what to buy, separating the necessary from the rest is hard to do sometimes. but when your baby decides he likes push toys, this little puppy does the trick! he loves pushing this thing around, and it's improves his balance and coordination. the only thing I didn't like is that the handle is a bit weak for strong children who bear down all their weight on it. my husband rigged it so he can't push the handle down to the shortest setting anymore but that's our only complaint.

B008RC72G8|5.0|I watched Dark Shadows years ago as a child.  A few years ago my husband learned about it and we purchased all the DVDs to the show.  When this came out, a lot of people, like myself, found it funny because it gave us a laugh at the time period difference between when Barnabus was really around in the 1700s and then the movie brought him out now.  It was so funny, I had to add it to my collection!
B005CKPQHA|5.0|this is the best tv show ever...i watched 4 series in a few weeks..you are better off watching them week by week as not to ruin the winter.....it is a great form of escapism..it does glorify gangsters a bit..gustavo is one of the best villians ever...he does charity work and philantrophy as deception...just like real life villian bill gates..the actors are perfect for the roles..great show
B003O86FMW|5.0|Initially I was not planning to read the Hunger Games series because I thought the movie was just so-so.  I'm so glad that I changed my mind.  The first book pulled me in and by the time I finished Catching Fire I couldn't wait to immediately download the third book to my Kindle.<br /><br />Not only are the characters intriguing and the action compelling; but the overall themes are powerful on many different levels.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Too twisted for me. If there are people like this, I don't want to know or read about them. We are already messed up enough without sensationalizing their perversion.
0938045768|5.0|The title can be a little off-putting, but the book is about how to use your own body weight to build strength and endurance rather than relying on equipment. It is titled what it is because Paul Wade learned this training method in prison where body weight exercises were all he had access to. The book teaches you how to take simple exercises like push ups, pull-ups, etc, start pretty easy to build coordination and condition your tendons and ligaments, and then build on those exercises to make them progressively more difficult. By the end of the program, though it may be a couple of years, you should be doing one-legged squats, one armed hand-stand push-ups, etc.<br /><br />That's what the program is about.<br /><br />I was a little skeptical first, but after reading through the background on the program and the theory behind it, it all sounded logical. I've been doing it for eight or so weeks now, and I love what the program has done for me so far. I can already tell a difference, just from doing wall push-ups. I have a hard time working out usually because of the commitment of driving to a gym several times a week, but I've been doing this in my bedroom. The only drawback is that you will need somewhere to do pull-ups eventually; I'm buying a pull-up bar soon for that purpose, and I've already purchased a weight bench to help with some of the other exercises. But if you decide you're going to stick with it and really do this program, the investment is still much less than a gym membership for the same time period.<br /><br />Overall, 5/5!
B000UBMSB8|3.0|Disappointing, I love the movie, especially the original release; however, the decision to make the second disk a &#34;3 in 1&#34; combination of three versions, seemingly by means of 'playlists' of the relevant scenes, backfired as the DVD player struggles to wend its way thru the script, resulting in jerky, halting playback. I'd have returned the set if only I'd realized in time. Still for under $10 for the set, it's hard to complain too loudly ...
B00A7ZWUJC|5.0|“Shine bright like a diamond.” That hypnotic catch phrase could very well be the catchiest hook of 2012. A more mature and peaceful side of Rihanna emerged as the Bad Gal has finally grown up! Unapologetic – her 7th studio album in 7 years is not only a step up from her previous studio album “That That Talk” but fits the mold as more of a “Loud” meets “Rated R” type of record. Unapologetic is Rihanna’s diary – It is, without question, Rihanna's most personal album to date, not to mention her most complex, both emotionally and sonically. But one would have to ask, is this album truly about Chris Brown? Whether she intended it or not, Rihanna’s on-again/off-again romance with Brown seems to be the biggest inspiration behind Unapologetic. Each of its 14 tracks in some sort of way has been colorfully colored with antidotes to their rocky romance that started on the eve of the Grammys four years ago.<br />To open the album, the rapid-fire lyrics of the opening track “Fresh out the Runway” shows Rihanna channeling her inner rapper. She spits rhymes over an electro whoop of trap music produced and co-produced by Hit-makers David Guetta and Nicky Romero.  Throughout most of the first act, she flirts with urban tinged stylings pulling in the infamous trap rhythms and screwed vocal samples. There’s indeed an influence of tapsters A$AP Rocky and Juicy J on one particular track “Pour It Up.”  The female anthem likens to the instrumental of “Bandz Make Her Dance,” where Rihanna drips with strip-club vernacular: “All I see is signs; all I see is dollars signs.” To follow the pace, a few guests are invited to the party. Eminem dribbles some mean breakneck bars on the down-tempo, freebase “Numb,” while Future croons on “Loveeeeee song.” “I don’t want to give you the wrong impression, I need love and affection,” he pleas. On the second track produced by David Guetta, he laces up with Nicky Romero again on the EDM house trackRight Now” with some warbling Dubstep that is sure to cause one to replace the speakers in their car from the booming bass that’s literally in their face. At one point Rihanna interpolates Genuine’s “Pony” with spectacular results on a song titled “Jump.”  Though self-reflective, RiRi still likes to have fun! She stays true to her roots on songs like “Lost in Paradise” and “No Love Allowed” where she continues her outlet of rock-pop guitar influenced songs and reggae inspired Bob Marley styled rhymes – respectively. However, the track that will have people chattering the most about is Rihanna’s duet with Chris Brown, “Nobody’s Business.” An ode to the late Michael Jackson, finds Chris and Rihanna flirting endlessly over the infectious melody on a two-step –friendly funk track! The two ultimately seem Unapologetic as they understand that their troubled relationship would indeed be brought to the attention of the listeners who will preview or purchase this album. This however is an honest depiction of young love, the kind of relationship that needs no approval from anyone and most definitely doesn’t’ seek any permission.<br />Rihanna’s personal friction with the media hangs lovely drooping all over Unapologetic. She continues to open up on hooks like “Round and around and around we go, now tell me how you know” and “I don’t know where to go, I don’t know how to feel.” “Stay” – beautiful torch ballad that’s a duet with Mikky Ekko, paints a picture of young girl lost and confused, persistent in her own opinions but still unsure how to convey her story to a world who is constantly watching every single move.  On “Mother Mary” she vents, “I’m from the left side of an island, never thought this many people would even know my name.” It doesn’t surprise me that she has to roll a blunt or two to clear head on the euphoric track “Get It Over With,” or come face to face with reality on “Love WithoutTragedy” as she addresses the pain in which she boldly belts, “You took the best years of my live, I took the best years of your life.”<br />At the end of the album, Rihanna begins to shed light on her greatest enemy: Fame. A beautifully written percussive ballad, “Half of Me,” tells a simple story. There’s more than what meets the eye. “I’m the type that don’t give a ****,” she sings, with no remorse. “Saw me on a television hanging out my dirty linen. You’re entitled to your opinion. Sit and shake your head at my decisions/ you saw me on the television, but that’s just the half of it.” For an album that’s titled basically saying “I don’t give two *****,” Rihanna simultaneously shows that she’s vulnerable and strong. It’s the perfect way to introspectively plug an album that lingers between ephemeral youth and accepting responsibility, in matters both public and private.
B0074VTHKM|5.0|This was a book that my grandson wanted to read.  I must admit that I enjoyed reading it as well.
B009X00E18|4.0|I like this cover for two reasons:<br /><br />1. It protects my Kindle Fire<br />2. It is light and doesn't add much additional bulk to the Fire.<br /><br />It is very similar to the [[ASIN:B006ZSTFYI Apple iPad Magnetic Cover]] in that the front of the cover is very thin, but still offers protection to the glass. I have the [[ASIN:B00825BZUY Amazon Kindle Fire Standing Leather Case)]] but prefer this one much more because not only is it much cheaper, but it maintains the thin profile of the Fire.  The back has notches cut out for all of the buttons and has a grill patter covering the speakers.  The front cover folds back and locks into a slot on the back so the Kindle can stand up horizontally. The only negative I found with it is that there is nothing to grab onto the front to open it, and it also uses one of those elastic bands to keep the cover closed, which I'm not a fan of. A magnet would be much better.  But overall, I am very satisfied with it.

0316227706|5.0|I first saw images of these dogs on the internet (AOL pages) and thought they were hilarious....or scary in some cases.  I sent the article to family and friends, then when I found the book on Amazon I couldn't resist, ordered 6 for Christmas gifts.  My nephew inmate got his immediately and loved it, said he would like to have seen more pictures so if another book comes out I will definitely order it!  The other 5 books are going to be sent to other family members and I'm sure they will all be as happy as my nephew when they open their gift.  Thank you so much for this amazing, funny, cute, scary photo book!  Absolutely love it, and yes...I did &#34;preview&#34; one of the remaining 5 that are being sent to others!!  Sure hope another book is in progress and wondering if there is a calendar &#34;out there somewhere&#34; with these fascinating photos??  Thank you, thank you, perfect book, perfect gift!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Simply boring, if it is erotica that you want to read there is much better to be found. This is so simply written and predictable
1579129129|5.0|I did not see or read this book because it was sent directly to family inmate's facility.  He said it is fascinating and in excellent condition.  The book was shipped quickly.  Since the facility opens and inspects all packages prior to giving (or denying) to our inmate, I can't say anything regarding condition of package, but it must have been perfect because our inmate said the book itself was in excellent condition.  He did comment that this book is &#34;Quite interesting and seeing the 'live photo' of each skull image makes it 'all come together visually'&#34;  He is now interested in studying forensic technology.  Thank you so much for sending this book.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Ken Follett announced it would take two years to write the second book in the Trilogy, and after reading his Fall of Giants I looked forward eagerly to Book Two.  It did not disappoint.  His portrayal of characters is so real it is his greatest strength.  He has put faces and personalities to the period 1933 - 1961.  It is a momentous task to depict the highlights of WWII and the beginning of the Cold War, but the intermingling of personalities brings this period alive and furtermore makes sense of this disastrous history.  Recommended for the &#34;old&#34; as a review of a lifetime, and especially for the &#34;young&#34; who do not know how it was and why we must remember.
1400049628|5.0|I purchased this book for nephew, an inmate, but facility 'censors' denied it, so he never got it.  This was frustrating, as they told him it was 'too graphic' in how to get out of a situation of confinement, but the inmates watch &#34;The Walking Dead&#34; series on cable TV, which includes visual 'escapes' that would be more impressive than reading material.  I can not provide a detailed review of this volume since it was not received by nephew.  However, knowing his interest in the current craze of Zombie activity which is prevalent in The Walking Dead, I'm sure this book would meet or exceed his expectations, so am giving it 5 stars based on that.  Thank you
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|this one is a real winner; I am totally loving it. Great graphics and a spooky story line. Well worth the money because it also lasts a long time. What more could you ask for :)
048623231X|5.0|I bought this for my husband.  He is very pleased with content, interesting volume.  This is a nice companion to Dante's Inferno which my husband is also fascinated with.  Recommend both this volume and the Dante's Inferno.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|One of my all time favorites, great cast, awesome from beginning to end. Hope they make a sequel. Just buy it. You won't regret it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Best show EVER!!!<br />If you love a good zombie story that is well told with talented actors and a riveting story line, then you need to watch all three seasons of The Walking Dead!
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Absolutely breath-taking!  I was moved to tears several times.  Utterly amazing story-telling through song.  I would recommend this album for all who loves big, grand music.
B00A6PD8RQ|2.0|Not the kind of story we were hoping for our family.  It ended well but was not worth the time it took to get there.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I use Calculator Plus for all of my basic math skills. Homework has been made easier thanks to Calculator Plus.
B008GXHOFW|4.0|I have a lot of space on my kindle so that problem was out of my way but to me it's kinda like an average Tony Scott movie it could be better. but the day after I got it I downloaded the dark knight rises and honestly I think it's better
B0001ARCFA|5.0|I'm going to start off this review by saying this: if you don't have a big head, you might find these unwieldy.  These suckers are BIG--much bigger than the AKG K-142 HD's they are replacing.<br /><br />The build is light yet sturdy, and they feel wonderful on my admittedly large head.  I'm a huge fan of AKG's self-adjuting headband, I find that it always sits very comfortably on my head--it's a wonderful piece of engineering!<br /><br />I also like the little gold accents on the headphones, however, I wish the gold and resin stickers on the end of each of the earcups was replaced with inlaid metal in the same finish as the gold rings around the earcups--it would look a lot more polished and &#34;grown-up&#34;.  But overall, they're not &#34;flashy&#34; headphones, you won't get any &#34;swag&#34; for wearing them, but they are definitely &#34;elegant&#34;.  I like the idea of refined, classic style, and I think these K240's fit the bill perfectly.  I want my headphones to play music, rather than to play the role of a fashion statement (I'm looking at you, Beats and others!)<br /><br />The sound is very...neutral?  You won't find it blowing you away on house/techno/hip-hop/R&B tracks--until you hit the vocals.<br /><br />These are very clearly intended for use in a studio for monitoring the various inputs for a track.  I personally love the feeling I get from these headphones--it's very realistic for the price.<br /><br />I haven't tried the Grado S80i's yet, but for now, I'm extremely satisfied with the K240's.  I can play music through my phone, computer, and iPad, all at reasonable volume.  But I can also plug them into my receiver with the included jack adapter for even better quality sound.<br /><br />I can say with complete certainty that these headphones were money well spent.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I've played cavecraft and all the other crapy rip offs but this is actually good and its just as addicting as the original minecraft
B00A6PD9I4|2.0|A princess who gets upset with her mother curses her...this is more of a morality tail than an uplifting adventure.<br />It just wasn't what we expected.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I enjoy gardening and flowers and enjoyed learning more about the language of flowers. It was a heart touching story or a young girl and her hardships in life and it was hard to put the book down.
0375851569|5.0|I love these books and I am so glad they come in a bundle. there arent very many book stores left around here so I had to turn to the internet
B005IQZB14|4.0|A great, painful, honest journey inward.  The book caputures the pain of loss and being lost, yet delivers the message of resilience.  Don't miss this book- It will haunt you, but it will also reward you.  Cheryl writes incredibly well.
B006ANJ4BW|1.0|In a word... Horrible. \\"Red Sonja\\" looks like an Oscar winner next to this movie. No amount of freed-female-bosoms could save it. This is a true waste of time.
B0066W1AZK|3.0|it is ok but lacking some basic chess funtion. when no pieces but king the game continues, no rating system.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|I'm gonna rock you each and every day! And I do! Celebration Day is a wonderful new addition to your Led Zeppelin library.<br /><br />This is an incredible work from Led Zeppelin's 2007 O2 concert. A clear difference in delivery from previous Led Zeppelin's live offerings but fresh for today. I actually like the bonus DVD soundtrack better than the live concert because it's cleaner, more focused on the tunes with a better recording of the instrumentation, less on the magic of the roaring crowd...but don't get me wrong, both are excellent. All around, this is another rare passing of the zeppelin overhead. It's as fulfilling as is was back in the day, and most notably, arranged to honor Ahmet and Atlantic Records. Think back...weren't your best albums all from Atlantic Records?<br /><br />Will we ever see Led Zeppelin live again? I hope so. Celebration Day has shown us that Jimmy Page can easily take you away to places unknown on his Les Paul, and John Paul Jones amazes me with how very much \\"kit\\" he can carry. Jason would do his dad proud. Robert puts out the fury and tender moments as well as ever. To say that Led Zeppelin music was from another time is like saying Mozart, or Aretha Franklin, or Glenn Miller, or The Beatles was from another time, or it is just a \\"body of works\\". The sounds from true masters like Led Zeppelin will live on for centuries. Let's hope that we will see the Led Zeppelin airship again, casting it's shadow upon the Earth...nearby my town or yours'.
B008F5YDRI|4.0|Loved the movie and the ending was something I expected, but it was good anyway. I would recommend it to my friends.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|very fun game, my son loves it too. we sit and play together. It's a lot of fun... .. ..
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|it is an ok game but you can't play it for even half an hour without it saying something about having to buy the full version.
0425263916|5.0|This series has been compared to Fifty Shades and I would agree.  This series, however, is much more realistic and is a better written book.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Its a classic Reacher novel and an exciting read from cover to cover. Non stop action at a good pace. I am disappointed to have seen a commercial with Tom Cruise playing Jack Reacher.
B007HGPBRC|3.0|but this book wasn't worth $12.99.  It was short enough for me to read in an hour.  I loved the author's atheist views, but they're not too different from what's already in his other books.  I thought this book would be more about his dying process.  Still, I would recommend it--just not at this price. **UPDATE** I see now (as of Dec 26, 2012) that the price has fallen to $8.89.  I would say that it's a good price now, but keep in mind that it's still a book you can read in an hour.
B000K4WLXA|5.0|Just as the product description says, this lovely collection has postcards, a script, a novel, and it contains Last Order on Disc 2!<br /><br />It's all in a very well made case that looks great anywhere!<br /><br />Looks great between FFVII and FFVIII
B0001CNRBG|5.0|This was a gift for my husband's first wife.  We get together every year for fun & fellowship & we thought this would be the perfect gift.  My &#34;sister wife&#34;  loved it!!!!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love this show.  It's like torture waiting for the next episode. This show is very well done, I can't remember being this excited about a TV show in a long time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so fun!!!!! The only problem I had was that it wouldn't let me into the store, but only once.
B001HBYHFA|5.0|At least it gives the chance to tie up the Firefly aborted television series. Excellently done as was the series.
B008TMA1LY|5.0|This game is great for 5-9 year old children! But I am older than 10 and love this game! It is pretty pointless and not the best game in the world, yet I cant stop playing it! It progressively gets harder as you get better and if I don't advance a level, then I keep playing until I do! Eventually my eyes get tired of straining to see the screen clearly so I have to stop. All in all, &quot;Hello Kitty Cafe &quot; is a decent game.
B00A6PD8RQ|4.0|There is some moral in the story. Its good if shown to children at right age. Under age children might enjoy animation.
034580404X|5.0|I just can't get enough of Ana & Christian...when you get past the &#34;kinky fxxxxxxx..it's a beautiful love story! Hope there are more to come!
B007KTA9PU|5.0|His remarkable bass voice rumbles beautiful poetry. He does it ten times. The chemistry between Cohen and his collaborator, Sharon Robinson, is clearly evident on this album.
B006RXPYXM|5.0|Helen Mirram's portrait of Queen Elizabeth II is amazing. You feel you are watching the Queen herself, instead of this very skilled actress. The depiction of Tony Blair is equally well done. This is an excellent film. Other reviewers have provided insights so well that I have nothing to add. Other than observing and listening to her from the days when she spoke to comfort her people as a teenage girl during the darkest days of the Blitz. (The Royal Family had chosen to remain in London throughout the war.) This is the mettle that forms great leaders. They can make mistakes in judgement, as any person can, but the great ones finally recognize their error and correct themselves. This film is about the crises surrounding the Queen when Princess Diana died in a car accident, and how she finally came to terms with it.
B0084AXZK0|5.0|I love this book.  I revisit it every few years.  I'm so happy to be able to read it with my Kindle app.  Now I might revisit Wilde's dark world more often.
0446580848|3.0|Probably it was my expectations being high, but I was very much .. Let down by this story. Kate in a veil, no resolution to the Bucky part of the story (other than, yes, there will be another one). The story itself was not as tight and driven as previous Corey or Brenner novels.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|THIS IS A MUST SEE MOVIE- GREAT STORYLINE - WONDERFUL BRITISH AND INDIAN ACTORS!!!!!!!!! I WOULD RECOMMEND TO YOUNG  AND OLDER AUDIENCE YOU WILL LOVE IT!!
B00A12VW86|4.0|Overall &#34;sound&#34; of album reminds me of their tunes pre-American Idiot, but I still like it.  A little more mellow.
1609611543|4.0|Wow! What an eye opener to what is causing so much illness in our country! I've recommended this book to many, many people!
B0029NY9YO|3.0|The best scene of the movie was when whoreshack killed that child rapist, also after learning about the screwed up conservative rapist character called the comedians past, I was glad that he got killed in the beginning of the movie, they seemed like a bunch of bland ultra conservative tea party type heros, no way in todays politcal atmosphere that this would fly, music on the movie was somewhat nerve wrecking, the only song that was good was the song by smashing pumpkins and that wasnt on the movie nor the soundtrack, it was just connected to the trailer for the film, but all in all it was a different take on superhero movies, and I did like the guy who was considered the smartest hero and mastermind of the whole plot, I really luv how he beat the shit out of the owl, who to me is a cheesy, geek looking, ultra conservative, silk spectre, who is a whore just like her mother, and whoreshack, who is kinda twisted, some of his ideals I like some I dont. The plots hella long, but if you have patience and like mystery type drama it can grow on you, cause I remember watching it and walking out of the theater in the middle of it, but when I decided to give it a second chance by buying the dvd for 4 bucks it grew on me,oh and by the way could somebody put some clothes on dr. manhattan, who seemed to not care about human life in the movie and who I wish coulda been destroyed in the machine along with that tiger.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|We missed this is the theaters and rented it through Prime. My family really enjoyed the banter between the main characters and appreciated that the movie showed them as having flaws and not perfect. Have to say the alien villians in this one were pretty nasty too. Good family film.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|This is a great movie that I would recommend to a friend. The movie starts off kind of sad, but lightens up as the movie progress. To me the movie seem to be more of a drama than a comedy, but it does have its funny moments.
0062235893|3.0|The Goodnight Moon Cloth Book Box is pretty and pleasant to the touch, but reducing the pages from one for each \\"Goodnight\\" to a mere six loses the effect given by the changing light in the room, as we (hopefully!) get closer to sleep.  I wish this had been made clear in the advertisement. I was very disappointed.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|I love this movie because it is full of action and it can be funny. This movie had me on the edge of my seat, wondering what was going to happen next. I would recommend this movie to a friend.
B0000AYJXR|1.0|I chose this rateing because the item I recieve was not what I order .After back and forth negotiation between the Seller we came to a compromise. But little did I know the item didnt work (was holding to send back). I sent it back anyway and have not hear from the Seller since.  In short don't agree to a compromise no matter how good it sound without testing what you have on  hand.  TITL<br />  Space Jam (Two-Disc Special Edition)
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Amazing book! Well written and impossible to put down! Spiritual, inspiring, adventurous, and moving.  Can't imagine who would not love it.
B009NQKXYK|5.0|In my opinion, if not better than the original, it is just as good! Rarely, does any great movie,(or for that matter),any movie at all have a sequel or prequel that does the original any justice. This one did!!!
B009SQRL4U|5.0|Kids loved this movie! We rented it and will be buying it very soon because they want to watch it again!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Great game that is a lot of fun and at times challenging. i finished the quest am doing it again
0345803493|5.0|really unable to rate this product as it was not for myself but the person it was brought for seems to enjoy it
B000JMLKCG|5.0|So many people have read this classic book that if you are one of the few who haven't then give it a try. Its an excellent novel of English life.
B004V5A7K8|5.0|Yup it is, another one of those addicting point and click games... I am such a sucker!!! Hours and hours of finger eye coordination challenge!
B0063GORYU|4.0|Fun and challenging.  I have only tried the two suit game because I think the three or four suit games would be too hard to win.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This is a good little game to either burn a quick 5 mins or run through an hour, would recommend it to others.
0062127241|4.0|Thank you Mr. Townsend for being suprisingly candid about your personal feelings in your book.<br />I think this memoir is his current thoughts about his life as he remembered them at this late stage in his life.<br /><br />The honesty that was exhibited concerning hardcore topics of drugs,sexuality,etc. was suprisingly candid and fans can once again express gratitude to the visionary who was able to express for all of us our conscious and unconcious feelings and thoughts about the human condition.<br /><br />A couple of what I feel are important issues in your memoir appear to be glossed over.<br /><br />Most Who fans were very cognizant during those times of your mostly publically unexpressed  emotions toward your band mates. You could intrinsically just feel it. Not just  the emotions of hate, envy and anger that all of us similar angry men and women felt toward those closest to us but the feelings of love, happiness, and kinship towards those same fellows.<br /><br />You pretty clearly exposed your emotions and actions regarding those outside of the outer ring of the Who foursome including members of your family and Who management but I personally felt you left out your bandmates for some unknown reason.<br /><br />Maybe I'm wrong, but I felt you left out not just your feelings towards your bandmates during various time points but also what your percieved as their thoughts about you in your shared careers which was suprising and disappointing especially in light of the frankness on topics and people that you did address in book.<br /><br />In addition, there was not much mention of what you did together and the experiences you shared outside of your performances.  I got the impression that as soon as the show was over, Roger went away by himself and Keith and John went out together to party and you were left alone.<br /><br />Maybe that was the case but we all have impressions of the people we work with or the friends we are/were lucky enough to have had in thepast. I would personally think not sharing the stories/activities I collectively partaked in with my friends; my feelings towards them and the conversations we had together would leave readers feeling somewhat cheated which in a way is how I felt.<br /><br />I had some crazy times with my good friends, and many times with the Who music fueling the fire, and I would feel a percieved true bond with your group and  that  all of us shared similar passion for stoner type conversations, girls,partying, et. all. And after reading your book made me feel that I was potentially taken for a commercial ride.. (I am sure this is not true, but that is how I felt).<br /><br />Also surprising was no real commentary or self analysis regarding your views of your very own lyrics which are some of the greatest ever written.<br /><br />Too too many to list, but no real commentary about the inner thoughts that produced some of the most insightful relevations left me again feel kind of cheated.<br />To a certain extent while reading your book, you made me feel ,&#34;hope I die before I get old&#34;, &#34;met the new boss, same as the old boss&#34; were just words to fill out a song, not issues meriting further discussion. And  that Tommy was just some dude who was blind who was looking for spiritual enlightenment.. whatever that is.<br /><br />At my stage in life, I believe I can finally discuss what quadrophenia is since I certainly did and still do live with this disease moreso than what was provided in the book and that leaves me a little sad especially since so many of us so oftened once turned to the great psychcologist of rock for answers.<br /><br />I know I am probably misguided and wrong regarding my thoughts and feelings towards the book.. but they are what they are. Grateful for what was shared and disappointed in what was not.
B007M45PMU|5.0|stumbled across their video on youtube (ho hey) before it was a hit. this whole album has been on repeat since the day i downloaded it. great music and with songs that paint a picture of where they are coming from. its in the vein of mumford & sons so if you like them give this band a try. they wont let you down.
B008CPZNL6|3.0|If I could download it to my tablet, I would appreciate it more<br /><br />Thank you for the phone version. It is excellent
B0092MKFIY|4.0|this album has some awesome music on it. from the feel good, on top of the world, to some deeper feelings like, demons which i love. get it and enjoy.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|This show is amazing, if you start watching it you will be hooked. I can't wait for the next season!
B00632HWOG|5.0|Couldn't do my day with out this, it works so much better than the native email program of the kindle. Since I do my Yahoo all over the place, it works with my 'yahoo account' and I don't have to keep syncing it up at a desk computer.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I loved this book, very suspenseful, but the language was X rated.  I think without the adult language it would have been a 5 star book for sure.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I like the ability to mix and match different sounds to make an 'almost' song. Just enough music to give it that 'steady' noise with some variations so that you don't just block it out and then need something else to block out other noises. This will pretty much set you up with something that will garble and mix with other sounds so that nothing comes out to sharp or loud or annoying, and you can go to sleep on it real easy. Like the ability to turn it off with the timer.
B008QTV3X0|4.0|Intelligent script for the storyline. Will have to wait and see how intelligent is the take away message about the link between the theme of Homeland and the faith of a billion plus peoples
B006YC74E8|5.0|Works fine, does what I need; this is nice little package for working with any of the pictures, but it is a little clunky if you try to do more than one at time.
B0016BP0PW|4.0|Excellent interpretation of Beatles songs. Highly recommended for music lovers. Especially Beatles fans will not be disappointed on this excellent Blue-Ray disc.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|and the walk through mentioned elsewhere is must sometimes, but this is angry little birdies and they want their piggies. If you don't have the Bad Piggies, you need to have it, if for no other reason than it's ROVIO and it plays.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is a pretty fun addictive game. I'ge already beat all the puzzles so reinstalled the game to start over. Only downside to the game is that you can never earn enough dozer dollars with the puzzles to upgrade all the prize levels. Needs more puzzles to earn more doser dollars!
B003Y5H5HY|3.0|This isn't in any way bad, its just not as good as i thought it'd be. Being a fan of the first 2 of the Swedish films (havent yet seen the 3rd) and a fan of Fincher's films and Daniel Crag as an actor i expected much more from this. Craig is of course great in the film, but Rooney Mara as Lisbeth doesn't seem like she was that Into the role at times. I found myself thinking certain scenes weren't up to par or as powerful as in the Swedish film, for instance: when Lisbeth is mugged near the beginning there is no sense of Danger at all involved, its just a Simple bag snatching scene with Her yelling distortedly at the single mugger. And another example would be at the end where the Car explodes. It really isn't as powerful or deep compaired to the Swedish version. And the same goes for the flashbacks. As i stated, the film isn't bad at all - i just feel Fincher could've done much more with the story. Hopefully the next one is better. Somewhat a disappointment in said areas. 3 stars.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|Great movie for kids of all ages.  A couple of scenes with the &#34;bad guys&#34; could scare &#60;5 year olds, but overall very kid friendly movie.
B007REV4T8|5.0|Wow. From the first 10 minutes you know you're in for one hell of a time. Craig is magificent in his 3rd Performance as 007, putting Quantom of Solace far behind him, he exudes with Danger and Style in this. Javier Bardem's performance in my eyes is, Oscar-worthy. Yes i said it. He is by far one of the top Bond villians ever. A certain scene featuring him just made me exclaim WOW. It was very unexpected. This really is just an excellent piece and is destined to become a Bond classic. From the excellent and entertaining action sequences, to the classic witty remarks, this is just a masterful entry into the Bond franchise. Can't wait for the next one!
055358202X|3.0|2.5/5<br />First off, I am NOT a fantasy reader... however, I was captivated by the TV show \\"Game of Thrones\\" and in turn loved the first three books. (I gave each of the first three books 5-Star reviews.) However, \\"A Feast for Crows\\" just is not Martin's best. My biggest issue with the book is that there is hardly any action; the main characters of the book just sit there and plan and plot the entire book. Also frustrating was the introduction of several new characters whom I couldn't care less about. I'm sure they will serve a purpose later in the series, but Martin did absolutely nothing to make them interesting or endearing to the reader.<br />\\"Feast\\" is definitely the weakest in the series so far. I hope the series gets its spark back in \\"A Dance with Dragons\\"!
B008QE9XD2|5.0|Great movie with great music!! I love Johnny Depp and he did great once again! Helena Bonham Carter is awesome as well!
B009KHCT94|2.0|The storyline was so confusing, it was hard to watch. On the other hand, some of the plot was quite amusing.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|This game is a lot of fun.  Some levels are hard but it's supposed to be that way.  My 10 yr old son loves playing the game to.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Joss Whedon is a genius! He pulled all of the various story lines together and made a compelling movie, even for those of us who aren't comic book fans. I also believe the casting of Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk was inspired. He was amazing.
B00263HWM8|2.0|Saw MI-1 and somewhat believable but this was all about action stunts which were pretty good but way over the top bordering stupid. Too many super close ups of Tom Cruise and not enough of his hottie co-star.<br />I would have given three stars but Amazon streaming and picture quality not very good. I purchased HD version and several times movie stopped citing bandwidth but never have this issue using Apple TV, Hulu, or others.
B006TJXZ30|4.0|Microsoft's Hotmail app is better than the mail service that comes with Amazon's Kindle Fire HD. With the Hotmail app, I have the empty folder option. Not so with the mail thing on Kindle Fire.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|This is an awesome movie! I actually saw this at the theaters and paid to watch it again. Highly recommend!!
B004GYY714|4.0|Most radio apps will limit you to stations in the US. Tunein radio gives you more choices. It gives you the World.
B007T99ENE|5.0|I love it! I read it in portuguese version, and now I am reading it in english!<br />One of best of Ian Mc Ewan's
B004DLPXAO|1.0|,, but, after searching the amazon.com jungle for answers ,, I found it.  one has to own a kindle device, not the kinlde app, in order to read free books from the amazon prime membership lending library ,, boo!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this app.  If you like puzzle games then you should download this app.  There are in app purchases but you still get a lot for it being free!
B0090OPBTC|4.0|I have the Explisit version also (which I love a ton), but I feel a better job could have been done on the clean version. I long for a day when rappers do a whole separate rap for those of us who have kids and want to enjoy the music too.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|this is a great movie again by pixar! good mix of comedy, drama, and action. The plot is great not many weaknesses I would suggest this movie.
B001E45XT4|4.0|One challenge I have when buying headsets is trying to find cups that actually fit around my ears, rather than sit on top of my ears.  I don't have as much time as I used to for gaming, but when I do carve out a block it tends to be a 5-6 hour session.  On-the-ear headsets just aren't comfortable for me to wear for long periods of time, no matter how tightly or loosely they clamp around my head.  The cups on this headset fully enclose my ears, putting the (relatively light) pressure against my jaw and head rather than right on top of my ears.  They're also well cushioned and have a fabric lining inside the ear cup itself, just right to prevent sore ears.  If a headset doesn't fit completely around my ears I won't even bother looking for anything else that might be good about it.  Granted, this usually means all my headsets make me look like a movie set extra for a documentary on flight deck officers, but I don't wear them out of the house so any potential for fashion disaster is usually averted.<br /><br />One particular feature I like is the extra-cushiony fabric covered padding that around the top.  I shave my head, so having hard plastic or worse, vinyl padding, at the top is a deal breaker for me.<br /><br />Sound quality is good for a mid-level headset, but the volume control is a bit awkward.  It's a plastic spin wheel (kind of like an old style electric blanket), which is fine except it's black plastic with no painted or highlighted markings.  This means in low light you can't really see the wheel and have to feel for it.  Not a serious ding against the product, just evidence of cost savings, I guess.  It just seems odd to have a product with color splashed around at various points (red transparent plastic moldings, red molded cord terminations, white letters on the USB adapter, etc.) yet the one area I'm likely to need to see and adjust, the volume control, is plain black.<br /><br />As for durability, I've had them about 8 months now and they're still working, so thumbs up overall!<br /><br />Update:<br /><br />A year and a half later (now mid-June 2014), these are still working great and just as comfortable as when new.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Such a sweet move. Great for mothers and daughters. I would watch again and again! Plan on buying in the future for my grandaughter.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|It's not many books that can make me cry. A fantastic read. Anyone over 13 I believe would benefit from it.
B00A6PD8RQ|3.0|3 STARS IS MY OPINION OF MOVIE.<br />IT WAS SLIGHTLY DISAPPOINTING DUT TO THE ACCENT.<br />SCOTTISH ACCENT WAS VERY HARD TO UNDERSTAND AT TIMES.
0345803485|5.0|This book took me by surprise..<br />I'd be at the gym working out, and trying to read at the same time lol<br />I finished it in only a couple days.<br />Now I have something to keep myself completely occupied when my hubby<br />Plays halo 4 :3
0525958002|5.0|I think the book was a great insight to what John have been through in his life. I cried and laughed all the same. I could relate to him on the death of his parents and my heart when out to him. I am glad that he was able to talk about his time in rehab. I have heard others say that they felt his book wasn't detailed enough, but I think that it was perfect really.
B005SDMDRW|5.0|Another great read by Michael Connelly. He always has the X-Factor when ever he rights. I hope he keeps Harry Bosch alive for a long time to come.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|We love this show! We haven't laughed this hard in a movie for a long time. Everyone must see it
B009GIPDQS|5.0|The best novel by John Grisham to date. What a great read. It was great to see the GOOD GUY being the BAD GUY and getting away with it. Then the real bad guy getting his fair share of justice.
B009157BWU|3.0|why i was happy to finish watching this film, I was disappointed with the middle to last part of the film, it fell apart and lost its focus.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I wanted a simple calculator and this one foots the bill. it's really easy to use and the screen is huge!
B009VB97EY|4.0|Ok so i wanted to see this movie for all those naked men, but it turns out it had a real story behind it.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I have deliberately changed tablets specifically to run this game. Absolutely addicting. I can't wait for the sequel. Thanks for hours of Zombies.
B009VB7QQA|4.0|Its worth watching, just for entertainment purposes, the cinematography was excellent, the acting was ok, but overall i would purchase this film in bluray for under15$
B007THA4FI|2.0|If you're feeling too good- buy this book. The characters are universally unhappy and many are down right mean. Oh, for some prozac for this cast.
B003SI9WYG|5.0|Love the soundtrack, love the movie. Rented it just to get my fix, and I reccomend this movie to any family.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I cared about every one of these characters and was anxious to find out how their lives progressed.  Ken Follett always delivers a great story and this was no exception.
B0077ZNCE2|1.0|I would like to review the movie, yet after checking in my library multiple times, it never arrived, so I have nothing to review except bring ripped off by Amazon. Sure, it was only $1, but it's more about the point.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|book is well written, entertaining.  i could read this in one sitting if I had the time.  not for young teens  very provocative, much cursing.  yes would recommend to open minded adults.  donna w.
B00702NWW4|5.0|Just discovered this artist on youtube and after watching some of her videos decided to buy her CD. I love summertime sadness, blue jeans, and national anthem. If your considering buying it but are unsure watch her videos.
B00A77II0U|5.0|This is a great game. It has a very good story line. The puzzles are fun and the graphics are very clear. on my Kindle Fire. It takes a while to download so be patient. The hidden objects are not hard to find and so far I have only had to go back to the same hidden object site twice and all the others are new. Playing the &quot;expert&quot; is the way to go if you have played several hidden object games before. I hope they make a sequel to this one soon!!!!!
B009FZFONO|5.0|It's a great series. It doesn't disappoint. I liked that I was up on amazon fairly quickly so that I could watch it within 24 hours of airing.
B00A6PD9I4|1.0|Kids questioned plot as did we. And they are little. Just didn't enjoy or find it worth our family time
B009VSW15Y|1.0|Apparently &#34;Kindle Tablet Edition&#34; means the new Kindle Fire HD not just any Kindle Fire.  I don't own the equipment to make it work.  Apparently I am not a savvy purchaser.
B008VBYN80|5.0|This game is just the kind of game I like to play. If you like interactive games that have quests to complete this game is for you.
B007THA4FI|3.0|I think her characterizations are very good, but the plot is lacking. I could get a good take on the characters, but she didn't make me care about them.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|perfect app for kindle EVER! yay! love it love it love it love it! my bff and I can play into to wee hours of the morning!
1451695195|1.0|This book was a disappointment.  There was very little scientific explanation for his experience.  The main weakness for me, a nonbeliever, is that the doctor requires the reader to simply \\"believe\\" that meningitis rendered his neocortex inoperable and incapable of creating the visions the doctor had.  Isn't it just possible that we simply do not understand the brain sufficiently to be able to explain how it was possible? He just never convinced me that his visions of heaven were anything other than hallucinations.  He actually  had so little to say that much of the book was repetitive and poorly-edited.<br /><br />Edited to add from an article in the New York Times on Nov. 27, 2012:  Dr. Martin Samuels, chairman of the neurology department at Brigham and Women's Hospital, a Harvard teaching affiliate, remembered Dr. Alexander as a competent neurosurgeon. But he said: \\"There is no way to know, in fact, that his neocortex was shut down. It sounds scientific, but it is an interpretation made after the fact.\\"
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|I thought it was gorgeous, funny and different from the usual &#34;princess&#34; movies. It surprised me and I loved all the characters.
B006CEKZ4Y|3.0|The film reportedly has some semblance to the life of William Randolph Hearst, and that is the only aspect of it that creates interest - otherwise it would be totally boring. Unfortunately, viewers have no idea what parts might be modeled after Hearst - other than the fact that Kane is a newspaper magnate and lives in a fabulously opulent Xanadu (Hearst Castle).
B0071BGOJC|4.0|While not as good as the first in the trilogy, this instalment was very easy to read and really enjoyable
1449410243|4.0|The book contains numerous short chapters, the first being '6 Ways to Tell if Your Cat Thinks It's A Mountain Lion' - eg. constantly trying to take down animals much larger than itself, eating dog food. Then it's depictions of a cat sitting atop a computer keyboard wanting to be petted, how to pet a kitty, etc. The book points out that excessive shoveling of kitty litter by a cat is actually practice for burying bodies (possibly yours), provides 'Dilbert-like' conversations at work with cats in the office, ways to deal with cat litter, how to tell if your cat is homosexual, etc.
B007TK77QE|3.0|I found this book bland, slow and not very interesting. While JK is brilliant at describing different characters, the plot around them was just disappointing. Expected more :(
B005HSL626|5.0|It is very good for eye hand coordination. Very competitive to try and beat your own score. Would recommend anytime.
0978545095|5.0|I am very much enjoying this book, so much so that I am purposely going through it slowly so that I can make it last.  As a hobbyist photographer, I find Vivian Maier's photography very inspiring.  She seems to have had an incredible knack for capturing so much feeling in her shots that it pulls you into the page.  Amazing.
B00005JNQS|5.0|When I received the product the packaging was excellent, great condition, and was described perfectly.  I knew what I wanted and I got it.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|The movie was very true to the book and I loved it! The acting was excellent, as were the special effects.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|What can I say, everyone needs Wall-E.  If you haven't seen it, you must.  The delivery time was very good, but the packaging on this one was below the standards that I am used too receiving.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|While I enjoyed the second installment, in the first 60% of the novel there was so little dialogue and so much sexual content I found that I had become desensitized. I also found the constant description of Gideon's physical appearance to be irritating, I get it... Eva thinks he is Gods gift to women. However, I find the way the couple handle their issues such as insecurity, jealousy, and trust that come in relationships to be somewhat  realistic. I find I cannot help but root for these two people to work it out. I find Eva in particular to be a kindred spirit, and at times I find myself saying, \\" I would do that too.\\"
B0009UC7H0|5.0|I already had a copy of my own, but like it so much that it was always being lent out to friends.  DVD quality and delivery time was excellent.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|A WONDERFUL ADDITION TO MY GROWING 3D COLLECTION. AT AMAZON'S TERRIFIC PRICE I COULDN'T PASS IT UP. TOP FLIGHT STORY, WELL CAST, SUPERB PRODUCTION VALUES WITH TOTALLY STATE OF THE ART SPECIAL EFFECTS. THINK \\"AVATAR\\" QUALITY.<br />IF YOU ENJOYED THE \\" ALIEN\\" MOVIES YOU HAVE TO EXPERIENCE  P R O M E T H E U S !!!
B0035LJZ1Q|5.0|Love the crisp clarity. Such a colorful movie. I forgot how awesome Mr. Walken  and Depp are. I've watched it 5xs now in two days.
B009K0OL06|5.0|I recently saw season 1 and I was hooked. I love all the characters especially Gabriel Mann. His witty one liners have me coming back each week.
B0090P0O70|3.0|The story of Frankenstein is a classic of literature of the romantic period, and the story of the monster is very touching and identifiable.  Who hasn't felt like an outcast, or been rejected by someone they loved?  He seems to be more human than any natural human in the story.<br /><br />However, his creator, Dr. Victor Frankenstein, is an incredibly irritating character and completely ruined what could have been an incredible story.  He seems to have the attention span of an intoxicated gnat, and his feelings swing from pole to pole in an instant.  His character development is unbelievable, moving from excited scientist to world-weary hunter and back again in the span of mere pages.<br /><br />Maybe the 1831 version is better, and I have certainly heard that at least its writing style is more mature.  Unless you for some reason need this one in particular, I would go with that edition.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|This movie like all of Wes Anderson's films was exceptional and really a great watch. It's simple and very cute story of two young teenagers in love and along with it a lot of quirky and hilarious cast.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Best show on Television, hands down! Great writing and plot development drive this character based drama. The zombie killing is just icing on an already delicious cake.
1451696191|5.0|This story is about the main character, Charlie, the narrator who wrote the letters to unknown person about the life of him being a freshman in the local highschool in Pennsylvania(I only got the hints in the book). His favourite aunt, Helen, who was killed when he was young and also even his lifelong friend, Michael had recently killed himself so this mean Charlie will be left alone by the time he started highschool but it is shortlived when he met the step-siblings, Sam and Patrick who are the seniors. They are changing his life in the rest of the plot. I cant tell you because it might spoilt your excitment. It is very emotional, even though since I always thought that I am the only one who is wallflower and I wished that it is true story for me because I loved the new kind of character Charlie is by the end of the year so I would like to be like him. This book is an excellent book for self-esteem.<br />This book is appropriate to at least fifteen years old because it is containing sexual materials, languages, etc. Overall, I highly recommended this book. I totally love it.
B002M87W9K|5.0|I like some musicals, such as Grease, Little Shop of Horros, and others. And this is one of the musicals I can enjoy watching<br />again and again. When you watch it, you think to youself; &#34; hey, they were doing the first rap music :). &#34;
B00A6N8F4Y|2.0|Movie depended on the draw of gratuitous sex to make the story sizzle.  For those looking for porn, they would have gotten a kick out of it.  There was a typical storyline about drug deals gone bad.  The savage acts weren't so surprising or menacing as they may have intended them to be.  Salma Hayek over-acted in some parts.  The end message was that small time drug dealers could get away with this kind of thing.  Very disappointing movie with unnecessary sex scenes.
B009Y6UCMM|5.0|Recommend this new album to all Areosmith lovers! Easy download and your ready to listen. Great price! Amazon mades buying music so easy!
B009SQRC9E|5.0|Wasn't happy with the downloading issues but Loved the movie and yes it will be an add to the Christmas  collection
B00992CF6W|5.0|i love this game! its fun and i can play it all day long. i say it should be free though so more people will buy it and have as much fun as i do it love this game you should get it!
B003Y5H54W|4.0|The people of Daggerhorn have been at a truce with a Werewolf for many years. One day the Werewolf changes his mind and kills the sister of our heroine, Valerie. Promised to marry one man, but in love with another, the Werewolf hurts Valerie once again. An exorcist tells the people that the Werewolf takes a human form during the day, and kills at night,the villagers trust no one. Valerie's fate is inexorably tied to the Werewolf in a way she never could have guessed. This makes her a suspect and the bait to trap the monster.<br /><br />This is a pretty good gothic fairytale. The setting, costumes and atmosphere are excellent. It is more of a mystery movie than you would think by just hearing the title and reading a synopsis. At times it moves kinda slow, but delivers at the end. I do like that the ending isn't predictable. As I said before, this film moves a little slow. I think if it were faster paced, and a little scarier it would have been much better. It reminds me a little bit of Sleepy Hollow, just not as good. This isn't a movie that I think is worth owning, but I recommend renting it. It's definitely worth seeing once.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|i think it will be fun because ihave played it before and i loved it .it was so cool iplayed it all day and all night
B000MRA5NS|5.0|Bond has just gained 00 status. M sends him to Montenegro to capture a ruthless poker player named Le Chiffre. Le Chiffre is planning to use winnings to fund a terrorist group. Bond's partner, Vesper Lynd is skeptical about Bond's abilities and reliability. Le Chiffre's cruelty and cunning may be more than Bond and Lynd can handle.<br /><br />This is a great Bond movie. It clocks in at almost 2 and 1/2 hours, and Daniel Craig is the best bond yet. This movie opens and closes with intense action. It's one of my favorite Bond movies yet. You don't want to miss it.
B002JVWQSW|4.0|I bought the first season used for a present. I love this show, I got it faster than expected and haven't watched them yet but they were all there and it looked brand new.
B009A87Z6U|4.0|Bond meets a girl named Camille. Camille has ties with Dominic Greene, a major player in the Quantum organization. Bond then discovers a conspiracy to take control of a valuable natural resource. Bond must wade through an ocean of treachery, deception, and murder to foil Quantum's evil plot that will cost many lives.<br /><br />This is a very good Bond movie. Daniel Craig is the best Bond yet. The downfall of this movie is the girl that plays Camille, Olga Kurylenko. She's a terrible actress. She's got a pretty nice body, and that's how she gets acting jobs I guess. There is also a lame bad guy in this film too. Despite these things, Daniel Craig shines on the screen, and delivers a pretty good Bond movie.
B00AAS6FPG|1.0|First, the show itself continues to be well-written and acted in the second season, so for the content of the show, 5 Stars!<br />ZERO stars for FOX's policy of putting advertising on the episodes.<br /><br />Unfortunately, FOX has chosen to stick obnoxiously loud commercials at the beginning and end of each episode! A primary reason I purchase the shows like this is not to be bombarded with ads. I cannot imagine why FOX feels it necessary to put an ad at the head of each episode with a commercial for the show I ALREADY BOUGHT. Then at the end of each episode FOX insidiously inserts commercials for their other programming. I know I can skip through them, but I can do that with DVR from cable WITHOUT paying $1.99 an episode; I do not expect to have to avoid ads on episodes I purchase.<br /><br />Finally, since this IS commercial-supported (and with two ads, it definitely is), the price should be lower than for other shows which are sold with no commercials, and the product description should include that there are advertisements included on your purchased episodes.<br /><br />So BOO HISS to the FOX Network! Respect the customers who are already buying your shows. All you're accomplishing is making me reconsider my pass for New Girl. If FOX keeps this up, I'd rather just wait for the DVD set.
0767817710|5.0|A quick draw tournament is being held in the town of Redemption. The town is run by a corrupt mayor named Herod. Herod is a thug that charges 50% tax to all the citizens. A young woman named Ellen has come to take revenge on him for her father's death. Many others also come to the tournament with different motivations including greed, blood lust, fame, revenge, and justice. Only 1 person can win though, and the rest will bite it.<br /><br />This is one of my favorite westerns. It has tons of great actors. Gene Hackman, Sharon Stone, Leonardo DiCaprio, Russel Crowe, and Lance Henriksen all make this movie excellent. The suspense and drama are off the scale. This is a must see for all western fans.
B008D28HYS|4.0|I liked the black and whiteversion of this game a lot. It took a while to warm up to the color. Now that I'm used to it,I like the extra challenge. If you like logic problems and puzzles, give it a try.
B009VSW15Y|1.0|I purchase the app for the camera for my daugther to take pics and videos - it never worked right  have a tech support that will not answer to your emails and I'm stuck and lose what I pay for it .<br />Trying to get in touch with Amazon so I can get a refund the worse 1.99 I ever lose
B004GJDQT8|5.0|I use this app all the time. I check prices at the big box stores, and I use the shopping cart as a shopping list. Works great on my HTC android phone.
0762445262|3.0|The other reviews said this little guy was small, but I had no idea how small. It is mabe 2.2.5 inches tall and long, with maybe an inch wide.<br /><br />Also, the reason I bought this was, because it said it was USB powered. Sadly it is not. Its watch battery powered. Also, the light is not very strong. Even in a fully dark room, you have to be about 6 inches away from the wall to get a decent signal to appear.
B002BVXYQS|5.0|One of the best records them boys have crafted! Yall should buy this album or visits the pirates of the web.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This version of Angry Birds allows for the use of light sabers, force fields and more.  Lots of fun, may the force be with you.
B002RT2BXQ|3.0|I assume it will be fine. It is a Christmas gift for our Philosopy major daughter so nobody has seen this yet but since the original film was great, we expect to enjoy this too.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|Well it was awesome and let you do a lot of stuff and it does save oh it also lets you pick item but when you load you have to click on gallery!!!
B001L63JC8|4.0|like an old pair of jeans, Lamb Lies Down is just right. Saw Genesis do it at the Spectrum in Philly and hadnt listened to it for 25 years. It's Peter Gabriel at his peak and it's a great album. The pieces (23 separate songs) fit together like the puzzle that it is. After all these years I still don't understand it. But its a masterpiece.
B007C7UZIG|2.0|App really wasn't for me, runs in the background.  I wanted a fast way to access my own info but just going to the website is better.
B008QE9VJI|3.0|I enjoyed this film and there were funny scenes in it but at times some things were disjointed which was disappointing.  I love other Burton films (Nightmare Before Christmas, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Sweeney Todd, Edward Scissorhands etc.) but this film was only ok.
0446585041|3.0|This book reaches its best in the chapter \\"In My Head.\\" Ellen rambles through the book much as she thinks aloud on her show.  She is a spontaneously hilarious person. I marvel at the way she finds humor in pretty much everything. I was hoping for more LOL moments in her book.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|If you are a super fan of all things related to zombies, you have to watch this show! Great show!
B004GJDQT8|1.0|9 Steps to install the Amazon app on Andriod? Are you kidding me?<br />The most cumbersome install I have ever done  Why not make it in DOS code for an even greater challenge?<br />I'll use the internet and save my time
B009VB7P6G|5.0|I think this was an amazing movie. For me it was not boring at all it was really entertaining and had a good lesson. I really enjoyed watching secret of the wings because It was touching and at some parts it made me cry. But it all turns out amazing at the end. Wonderful movie and story.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|The reviewers didnt like this movie but who cares? I loved it and have seen it several times. each viewing reveals new details and plot twists. The extras disc is essential as some of the deleted material is critical to the story. I hate it when they chop up a movie to make it fit in a commercially acceptable length. This movie should have been longer and not had some key details removed. The videography is fantastic. This blu ray is a star.
B008EQIEWS|4.0|I liked the movie but I miss is having the ability to activate the captions . Other than that the movie was good
B009HV2JT8|4.0|Sounds like a teen movie or something nonsensical. However, it was well produced and quite entertaining. I actually enjoyed this movie quite a bit and was expecting almost nothing. You never know sometimes the title throws you off.
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|its ok and but it needs more time.........other than that its fun i enjoyed pouring lava on stuff ;heres a tip,  MAKE A TREEHOUSE
034580404X|5.0|These books are amazing. You have never experienced such a joy . I guarantee. I read all 3 books in 2 weeks.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is so much fun! Who would of thought a game that was so much fun when I was a kid playing at festivals is still so much fun as a grown adult!! Thanks
B002SSUQFG|4.0|I love automatic watch movements, and for the price and brand name, this was the perfect choice. I have somewhat large wrists and the band fits with 3 holes to spare.
B002A3NVKG|5.0|awesome awesome awesome so good i love patrick watson he is one of my favorite artists, go see him live.
B0091XRL86|5.0|I'm a sucker for animation - and comedies where there's an &#34;adult undertone&#34; - and this fit both bills!  It's funny, witty, and full of &#34;humor between the lines&#34; - you gotta love the little &#34;extras&#34; they throw in, the goofy sayings, the entertaining characters.  Seriously (okay, NOT seriously), it's good fun - and great animation!  Good laughs, a bit over-the-top for those younger than 9-10 or so...
B004EBZX6W|5.0|Occasionally I have to make adjustments to a wireless network at work with directional antennas.  This is a great item for measuring the strength of the signals and helping to aim the antenna.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Just outstanding app for eBay, own a android phone now and this app picked up where my iPhone app left off.
B000002VRZ|5.0|I have always loved The Outlaws and this is their best CD ever.  I recommend it to everyone who grew up listening to good music from the 60's and 70's.  Super band!  Delivery was prompt with no problems whatsoever.
B0063IH60K|4.0|does everything a compute does one ad each time u open the app etc etc etc etc etc etc etc
B000URDE2Y|5.0|If I only had a black light and a lava lamp! This really takes me back. I've always been a big fan.
B008XDSUNU|5.0|Great album by Wild Nothing.  There is not one song on the album that stands above the other, but in the era of 'the single', I highly recommend an album that is top to finish absolutely brilliant.
1603427244|4.0|THis is an impressive compendium of techniques for casting on and binding off your knitting.  Not only are the instructions clear and the photos excellent, there's also information on what situations are best handled by each technique.
B00A0HQ7H8|5.0|I was only mildly a fan of Lana Del Rey until she released the single for 'Ride'.  I enjoyed her lyrics, her repeating themes in tracks, her composition, and her delivery...  But in the end I love it when you think she is going to match lines or rhyme lyrics and she simply doesn't.  It is the biggest curve-ball, and it allows her to truly express what she is feeling, providing you with a much more intelligent, much more refined, and a highly emotional album.
B0073PPNE8|5.0|It appeals to the romantics, the historians, the Civil War historians and lovers of great movies.  Also Nicole Kidman is just beautiful
B003QSOFFO|5.0|Excellent movie!!!  A great children's story. Disney is always great. Taught my granddaughter about the adventure of finding new land.
B000SVZIGC|5.0|One one of my favorite childhood movies. I actually brought this home to watch with my parents and they enjoyed it just as much. My mom actually ended up crying because it brought back so many good childhood memories
B005NJU8PA|3.0|I am a bit disappointed by this book - I started reading and for the first 1/3 of the book everything was old information I had already read on Tim's blog/seen in his videos. Then came a surprisingly large section of recipes, which I am not interested in. As another reviewer said, the book completely lacks depth and is random. I also wouldn't recommend it to someone who is already a Tim Ferriss fan, as he/she would learn nothing new in it. All of this is quite disappointing, as the 4HWW is probably my favorite book - have read it at least 30 times.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I really wish that the full season was available in the US right now.........maybe a trip to the UK is in order.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|My daughter and I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  This movie was great for a mother and daughter to watch together.
B007EE4XKI|5.0|David Mack strikes again with another top notch Star Trek adventure! The first in a three book trilogy. Cannot wait for book two.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Creepy good. Not so scarey that I freak out later.  Great plot, acting, and keeps me wanting to see the next.
B005LAIHYU|5.0|I like most scifi movies, but there are some terrible ones out there.I had seen this at the movies and knew Iloved it and had to have it when available on dvd.Great movie
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I could not put this book down.  Pi's story is absolutely compelling and written in a rich, easy style that made it an absolute pleasure to read.
B008OOYALE|5.0|very good game,great graphics,cool dragons, addictive,ect. one problem is that you have to spend gold to get stuff done fast and get some dragons. you can breed most of your own dragons. personal opinion: I think that you should interact with the dragon more. I think that you should be able to actually play with the dragons, see the dragons eat, and things you would do with a pet. Don't spend much money, and you will love this game. people who say this game is junk need to find a life.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Absolutely amazing...you have to see this episode before watching the rest of the season!  Worth your time for sure!!  5 stars all the way...Jessica Lange is amazing!
B009GEAWOU|5.0|I can never get enough of this group! Will be sad when this show ends! =( Neil Patrick Harris is the funniest character of them all....amazing how well he plays a straight man. Love him! xoxoxo
B008MEM24S|5.0|Fun game with many levels.  Some of the levels are kind of tricky until you figure out the secret to it.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|JanN. I love this app. I get a little upset when I have all but one number left and it doesn't get called and time runs out but that's the name of the game.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|It really fascinated me to see a story through the eyes that had already lived a life and was lucky enough to take a shot at trying it again.  I enjoyed this book immensely.
B009YU62H2|5.0|Love this album. Happy to own it. Very pleased.<br /><br />It's new Soundgarden, but at the same time, it perfectly compliments their older stuff.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Couldn't put it down. A little predictable. Cannot wait for the next book . What is happening to Sansa  and Ric on?
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I loved Angery Birds for facebook and I love Angery Birds Free as well. Gives me hours of fun and a great way to whind down after a rough day at work.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really love this game! its allot of different games at once that I find really I.teresting. I like to unlock games all the time!
B002ZTIIXK|5.0|hadn't even heard of her till my niece sent me her song Halalulaya, loved it and then ordered her recollection album. very great singer.
B002BI6SMI|3.0|good movie but i wish the controls were easier and that the movie didn t skip, i don t think i could activate subtitles either
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book this really good the author should be thanked for telling the story the public love's and support's our troops and he is very careful not to say any more than we all know anyway
B0018QQQK8|4.0|Good Story line, and easy to get attached to the characters.  I would definitely recommend for any NIcholas Sparks fan.
B007YJS7G4|5.0|I loved this film because it portrayed yet another division of the Tuskogee Airmen and this countries miscalculation due to racism on how good these flyers actually were. It could be empowering to young men and women to do their best and even if they are not recognized for a job well done to begin with; their time will come--they could be the very best and have high ranking persons name request them to do a job that will make everyone proud including the naysayers.
B00448SE4S|5.0|Excellent cinematography at such a low price. Sure to please the niche audience that is displeased with current day hyper-media.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|A must read for those whose beliefs still waver with regard to God's existence and the purpose of life itself.  To have a man of science, and in particular one whose life's work is devoted to the brain, be the one to have this experience and then be able to report on it, is a blessing to be shared with all of mankind.
8866131059|3.0|BEWARE - This is the TINY 3x4 format; NOT the 6x8 size that the product picture shows. I love moleskin products and have been using the &#34;Moleskine &#60;year&#62; 12 Month Daily Planner Black Soft Cover Large (Moleskine Legendary Notebooks (Calendars)) [Calendar]&#34; for years. I should have read the description more carefully, but when I clicked on the previous year's order, I expected it to be the same product, but for 2013 (as I have done this in prior years many times).
B0085MNZ66|4.0|It is a straight forward game where you need to trace a path from one color block to a matching color block. When different color paths intersect it changes colors. Consequently, the order and path you choose make all the difference.<br /><br />This game is great for a quick brain teaser. I have heard people complain about difficulty and they have a point; this game doesn't pull any punches. If you don't like difficult puzzles then you won't like this game. I, on the other hand, think that it is awesome fun. Yes, awesome fun.<br /><br />Give it a try if you like challenging puzzle games.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love it.  Keeps me entertained. Makes me laugh.  Quick down load process.  I play every chance I get.  Enjoy
B009JNXK88|3.0|This game is very similar to Super Meat Boy. You have lots of short stages that you want to navigate as quickly as possible. Stages contain spikes, pits, platforms, and guys with guns.<br /><br />I really enjoyed it for a good 30 minutes. After that I stopped playing and haven't picked it up since. To be completely fair, though, I am not a huge fan of this type of platforming game.<br /><br />If you like platform games that are based on speed runs then you will like this game. Otherwise, you will probably want to pass.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I stay with the KJV. Nevertheless, the YouVersion has an excellent audio, enabling me to listen to God's precious Word with eyes closed and mind open!
B004ECDNJU|4.0|A fun traffic control game.  You have to adjust the intersection switches to send the right color orb to the correct receiver.
B003LJRTXS|5.0|and I loved it. This book was such a good read. Strong female characters. Interesting plot line. It's official I'm now a Morton fan.
0738727326|5.0|I'm in love with my Shadowscapes deck!<br />The art is just breathtaking; you can sit and look at each card and find some new intricate detail with each passing moment.<br />The spreads are alright, but i prefer to use a multitude of different spreads. The readings right true for all of them, which is the main point of any tarot deck.<br />The only thing i wished for is that the card descriptions were longer (i know there is a details book sold separately, but it would be nice if it was all in a bundle).
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great for it's intended purpose and for when i need some mindless activity to relax. I highly recommend this. Has many options I have yet to explore.
B000YHG72E|5.0|I can watch will Farrell in rights or running thru the street naked. He's a funny man and this movie was made for him
0547884591|5.0|Before I say anything else, the book I received was slightly damaged on the back. Where the paper is glued to the back panel is ripped a the seam. The binding still seems intact with the cover enough that it should be fine as long as I don't throw it against a wall.  This will not be reflected in my rating, as I'm sure Amazon would accept a return.<br /><br />I have not used the oven or stove in my apartment for weeks, and that was just to heat up some water to put in a Mountain House meal that was laying around. Otherwise, my range of cousins span poptarts and hot pockets.  After just a few days of reading, I am confidently experimenting with herbs and spices with an arrangement of foods without the fear that I will make something so awful that more of it will land in the garbage than my stomach.<br /><br />The entire premise of this book is about how to meta-learn with a focus on the culinary arts. However, this meta-learning can be applied to most anything you desire.<br /><br />On a final note, this is a very visual book. I have seen a friends copy on his e-reader,r  which we were sharing in our learnings.  However my hard copy just arrived today, and the visuals are worth the extra $$$ and lbs., which do not seem to be reflected as well in the digital copy.
B0064J6OMO|3.0|I think I need a twelve step program because this movie really was not good. I'm not I buy RR as a womanizer
B008966SIU|4.0|Took awhile to get used to, but very unique and complex. Definitely worth buying. Can't wait to check out some of their other albums.
B006ZBRMOU|1.0|If I had to listen to her dialog with her inner goddess one more time I was going to use my kindle for kindling. And I have a masters in finance, my literary bar is not that high.
B007SSEBCU|5.0|Streep is wonderful as usual!  Learned things that I never knew about Thatcher.  Truly a wonderful movie.  Buy it or at least rent it!
B000HZHPSS|5.0|could be the best in the series great score Data has the best lines. watch it over and over again
B004GBIE3Y|4.0|This is a touching story of a confused adolescent who gets himself checked into a hospital psych ward. Rather than going for stereotypes in the hospital the patients are portrayed as real people who are just somewhat different, not nut jobs.  Well done
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Grissom just seems to get better,this one is hard to put down<br />highly recommended lots of depth and an easy read
B007ZLKKZM|5.0|A must for Beatles fans!  Reveals the inner workings of the Fab Four and the role that George played in their success
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Carl is gonna be one hard little dude, if he lives through all this. Actually, So is Hershel.<br />This is the best group character development since lost.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Best of the series. The only one I have gone back and played to get all 3 stars on all levels! Just in case some don't know, you don't have to pay for the Pat of the Jedi if you get 3 stars on Tatooine and the Death Star. Good luck!
B001FB55H6|4.0|Okay so there were flaws. The movie was too long , the story was boring , and the unnecessary nudity. However I've seen it twice and I liked it better the second time. Zack Snyder's weakest effort though.
B009NQKXYK|4.0|if you liked the Alien films,you will like this. See where the alien creature was before the first alien movie...I guess. altho there are a few inaccuracies between this film and the other Alien film. still great visuals,good story,and a few ironic scenes compared to other alien movies.
0760335540|5.0|Great book it is almost all there for DIY home mechanic just need basic tools a garage and some confidedens
B0013KTGAG|5.0|I can't believe I hadn't heard of this movie before I saw it. It's well written, fantastically directed, beautifully shot, and really intense. Can't ask for more. Definitely one to own.
B009LK6JS2|3.0|You can fly around and take off and land, but some shooting would be fun!  I realize it's an app for smartphones, and what it does provide is a fun distraction, done well by the devs.  I hope the developers can add some fun combat!
B000G03RJA|5.0|Have wanted this for a long time and your reviews helped me get the best.  Super listening pleasure. I love it!!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|One of the best TV shows in a long time. Great story lines and great actors one of the best shows of the year.
B00A0A6F7C|5.0|When I saw that Susan was covering The Winner Takes It All, I was thinking no one could do this song justice after ABBA, but Susan's version has to be the most beautiful cover of this song. While this album is not as strong as her other 3 it is still fantastic and I have listened to it about a 100 ties since purchasing it and it does not get old.
B009WJ14FA|4.0|It is a total surprise to hear such an &#34;old&#34; sound  coming from such a &#34;new&#34; group. A Terrific recording!
B009VB97EY|1.0|Thought it would be beter. Although I was expecting it to be trashy, this was way more than that. If anything made it worth watching - it was Tautam's cuteness.<br /><br />I would have liked a little bit more of substance in the movie.
B002KYGLVQ|5.0|This is one if the best movies of all time with a great message to citizens of the world. Remember, people have the power
B008XG1X18|5.0|This was exactly what I expected it to be.  I am very satisfied.  I would not hesisitate to do this again
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Great detail on remaining battery life based on activity. Really lets you know how much you can do with a cool look. The only thing, and a minor one, is that when you initially look at the battery, it is not what the battery status actually is.
B002R27J1W|5.0|If you are 45-50+ you probably remember this movie. I just love it. Each and everytime, the end of the movie makes me scream and then laugh, to think that I still scream after as many times as I have seen this movie.:)
B007HACDLK|5.0|Good book I highly recommend this series to anyone who likes spy novels<br /><br />His best book is still Extreme Measures.
B008RV5K4U|5.0|This is a great story of Batman's mortality and his struggles with morality. A must see.  Looking forward to Part 2.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|It was great all the way through. When the cops raid the place--see what DeAngelo DOES--you,ll bust out laughing.  I felt sorry for the hard time Chevy had. Randy was a case and the old man with the stoogie--great movie.
B009LUBA7M|5.0|The reason I came to like Mika is that his music always sound very delightful to me. Even though the sound in this new album is a bit different from his usual materials, I still find it very enjoyable.
B004TI5N38|4.0|Excellent book with great character development. Great storyline and ending. The book wouldn't let me walk away without hurrying back.
B0068THAGY|5.0|I LOVED this movie! First of all, I am not a sci-fi fan, never have been. I read the synopsis of the movie and didn't realize when I first started it that it was science fiction. By the time I realized it was I was so into it that I had to finish it. The characters are real, and you find yourself really caring what happens to them. The actors are increible, especially the children!!! I can't emphasize that  enough! I highly recommend this movie. My 14 year old son liked it almost as much as I did! I don't want to give anything away, but the end had me almost in tears. Also, great music that I'm (almost) too old to remember! Keep watching after the movie is finished and you will get to see the \\"movie\\" that the kids made.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|Used to enjoy Facebook so that you can keep up with friends and family.  Don't like the new set up now.  Also, to many people are using facebook for the wrong reasons.  I barely use it now.  I don't think this has become the network that people first thought that it would be.  Very disappointed in it.
B008CP93S0|3.0|It wasnt the best movie that i have seen and it wasnt the worst movie ive seen.  Overall it was ok, but i probably wouldnt see it again.
B00A6PD8RQ|3.0|Its an okay movie but has to much Disney influence in the production.  The story is just so-so and the character  development wasn't great. If it was made just by Disney it would have been fine.  But this being a Pixar production they really drop the ball.
B0006HBZXS|5.0|Had a terrible time trying to find this DVD, so was thrilled when we finally located it. It came as promised and works great!
B0046B3QTG|4.0|Was a very enjoyable and had a hit of old style cartoon comedy.  If you haven't see it and want a movie you don't need to think about that try Despicable me.
B000ID37T0|5.0|One of my favorite all time movies. Love the Tango scene. Great ending with Pacino in the school giving his speech.
B009LK6JS2|4.0|Good displays - needs more scenarios to complete the experience.  Realistic response.  Flies pretty much like a real fighter.<br />F-16 Pilot
B0098VYKSA|2.0|This movie just didn't captivate me. Very predictable storyline. This movie also confirmed that I'm not a fan of Kristen Stewart.
B002IE2JF0|5.0|great flick...good storyline. Would recommend seeing this if you like sci-fi movies with<br />with a twist. Acting is A+ and the monster is awesome.
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|This was a really great movie and the effects were amazing.  My granddaughter, 3, had seen this and INSISTED on seeing it again.  Her parents hadn't see it either (her aunt and uncle took her to the theater), so...we all watched it.  I think it was a little intense for her, but the adults loved it.  Just like most of the Disney movies, if they made them with an eye towards the young children, you wouldn't feel like you should skip through the intense scenes.
B007BGQFTQ|5.0|After buying the first in hard copy and reading it in less than two days, I immediately went back and got the series for my Kindle. I really enjoyed this series. It is clever, with twists and turns, but you don't get lost in the mystery. The books are marked as fantasy horror for the genre, but it's no worst than the battle scenes in the Lord of the Rings or the creation of Frankenstein monster. Alexia has a practical yet amusing view of the society around her, with annoying relatives and interesting friends that most people can relate to, well in a non-supernatural way of course.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Love to play bingo. This is a twist on the game but interesting still the same.  I've only played this a couple of times because my daughter is always got my kindle.
B005LAII0I|5.0|I love movies that I can sit and watch with my mother, my daughters and my granddaughters and be thoroughly entertained the whole time.  This movie fits the bill for that.  Julia Roberts was, of course, fantastic as always.  Nathan Lane brought his cute zaniness to the story and the rest of the actors were just fun to watch.  The story was light, funny, exciting, and mildly educational.  We all loved it.  Not to be missed if you have more than one generation in the house.  The ending was a special treat too!
1434427986|1.0|What is this, the 1940's?<br />Since it's publication there has been major additions made to the book which were not included in this publication.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|The movie ever for Christmas !  My family watch it every year and it still makes us laugh.  We've bought many of them as Christmas gifts.
B00138KGS4|5.0|The Stooges have always been top on my list.  When I saw that Iggy had remixed the album I had to have it.  Raw Power is a great album!
B0087GZ8YW|5.0|One of the appealing things about Ian Rankin's writing is the sense of realism that comes through strongly. Unlike some comparable series where there is almost a sense of a character almost in a largelyageless sense of limbo, John Rebus has aged and changed over time.<br /><br />It was interesting to see Rebus in conflict with another standalone Rankin character, Malcolm Fox, with Fox being the antagonist. And in a time of greater accountability and similar expectations of police around the world, there is little, if any, room for a rule-bending maverick like John Rebus with Fox seemingly intent on ensuring Rebus is never readmitted to the force. This becomes a curious yet understandable conflict between these two quite different types of character.<br /><br />Not surprisingly we see Rebus in conflict with the newer style of management and full of contempt for those more interested in playing career games than actually doing the job.  In short, we see all the things we expect to see in a John Rebus novel but with the sense of Rebus now truly being an outsider, wanting his way back in. Or does he? It is the same challenge faced by many people whose career and personal life were so closely linked only to have the career aspect taken with and any sense of balance thereby lost.<br /><br />There is enough here for both fans and those new to Ian Rankin and John Rebus.
B009GEDP26|5.0|So far another great season for this show, it's an accomplishment that they've managed to keep the same feel for the series through the fifth season.
B007SGM084|5.0|I wouldn't recommend this to everyone, but I loved it!  CG is ultra hot and Anna is amazing!  Can't wait for a movie starring Mr. Cavill as CG.
1455527475|5.0|Helped to understand the mentality of some investment bankers i.e. money over people.  Short term profets verses guiding clients to better understand their investments.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great book with a great continuation of the story! I can't wait to finish the 3rd book in the series!
B009HV2JT8|5.0|Well written. As usual these days, overblown special effects and unbelieveable action scenes. But overall, well worth watching. After all, Abraham Lincoln as a vampire hunter swinging an axe? Yep :)
0345803485|5.0|I wasn't sure I would like this book hearing some of the things that are in it but I am so glad I gave it a chance. I just LOVE the story and love the 'adult' parts of the story as well. Lets just say I'm trying for a baby and this def helps! I am currently reading book 3. I cannot put them down, such a great series!!!!
B000VK99Z6|5.0|As always, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are a great team for a comedy. Highly recommend. Watch now. 2 more words as required.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a fun little game! It's pretty addicting. I haven't found the game to be too challenging yet but I just started.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|I really enjoyed watching this movie with my little kids. They were scared at first but now they want to watch it everyday. Highly recommended it.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Awesome account of a true American and what it takes to overcome adversity. Thank you Marcus for sharing you and your brothers story. I don't have the words that can even explain the gratitude and respect I have for our troops. God Bless America! Hooayh!
B001AUEMFS|5.0|This is a great song - I'm a latecomer when it comes to appreciating Coldplay's music but now that I've discovered them I can't get enough of them.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|Not the best book. The book was fine not good not good not good not good not good not good
B00A12VW86|5.0|Great songs, Green Day never fails to amaze.  Another brilliant feat of music. Songs are fun, and have that Green Day energy. They get better with each album. Get it!<br /><br />However, Amazon's download system did not work well. They need to make it easier to add to iTunes.
B003WUYRGI|3.0|This book was good and had words that I didn't even know was know was a real word like appley. The book was long ,but also had facts and examples on the word(s).the reason why the book got that rating was because it was also boarding all at the same time. But if u read it you'll learn new things. So kids give reading a try and maybe you will like it,maybe you won't but u won't know if u don't try.
B009P5S11G|5.0|I'll always love Rihanna. I have not yet reviewed the cd but I know it's cause I'm in job corps and they hold our mail for two weeks before giving it to us. I bought it on iTunes though and it's amazing.
B005LW5J9O|5.0|loved savoring the endless negative and guilt ridden world of the middle ages perpetrated by the Church....we needed to meet this missing link.
B0042RUMEQ|5.0|This cd made my 2011 winter. Good job nickiminaj<br /><br />I don't remember buying it though lol<br /><br />Got her new cd though. I love it
B003O86FMW|5.0|Keeps you interested throughout and leaves you wanting more.<br />Loved the story, and cannot wait to read the final book of the series.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I downloaded this  episode because I had missed it.  The download was easy and worked perfectly on my computer.  It was also cheap enough that I was glad to pay for one missed episode.
B004WGGQPQ|4.0|Colored pencil tips are too wide same width as crayons. While subtle changes in colors are shown on crayons, markers and pencils the additional colors FL not exist... Bummer!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|i have 5 kids and a i pad and there are many games on the i pad and the kids like this game it help them to figure out patters and line and shapes
B001AQO3QA|4.0|I purchased this collection because the price was right. I coudn't have purchased a single blue ray edition of even one of these movies for what i paid for the  entire collection.<br />  I really like the extra's in movies,especially the making of featurettes and this had plenty of minutes for all 4 movies.<br />  Rating the movies would have to be Aliens,Alien,Alien Resurrection and then Alien 3. I watched \\"Alien\\" and \\"Aliens\\" on DVD and it was great but in this case i noticed a definate quality change in the picture and especially the sound and usually it's not worth it because i don't pick up on alot of those changes.<br />  I don't know if they will ever offer this set for the low price i paid ($19.95) again but i think it was definately worth it. You might be able to buy it used for that price but i'm not sure.<br />  A little bit of a spoiler, if you do decide to purchase this set watch the extra's for \\"Alien Resurrection\\" -the basketball scene has a shocker of a surprise in it!
B007IXWKUK|3.0|It  is a soap opera! Good story but some of the parts are very repetative. Interesting ideas about sex and sex toys some are more wishful thinking than real, but you can never learn too much about this subject.
B009Y6UCMM|5.0|If you are a true diehard Aerosmith fan, You will love this album.  You can hear the creativity, the collaboration, the true Aerosmith essence.  Listen to one of their early albums, then this one - you can hear how much they have evolved and grown, yet kept true to their rock roots.  I mean seriously, do you really expect a band to stay where they were, sound like they did almost 40 years ago??  The ones who did, are no longer.  The ones who evolved, are still around.  This is a GREAT album..... every album will have a miss (Kerry Underwood, but who wouldn't want to have a duet with Stephen??).  Bottom line - it's Aerosmith, ballads and all.  A true Aerosmith fan is going to love it.  I personally love all of them, and I've seen many negative comments about Nine Lives and Just Push Play, among others, but they all have their place in the Aerosmith world, and their fans world.  If you don't like them, please make like Thumper, and keep your comments to yourself.  It just means you are not a true fan.  C-Ya.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|The best show on television, bar none.  Marvelous acting.  Complex characters.  Beautiful production.  You'll be thinking of it long after viewing.  You can't go wrong.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|This is a great chess app for beginners or experts.  havent tried the Two-player mode but the single player against the computer works well.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|Arrived quickly and was just what I expected, I already saw the movie and it was so good I just wanted on disc,
B009SIE6AA|4.0|Buy it but I was hoping for a better selection of songs. James Taylor has a great voice. I have always loved his voice.
B009LL4LMM|4.0|I really enjoy this game. It's perfect for wasting time. It subtlety teaches physics in an entertaining way. Great buy.
1452101248|5.0|I am not a vegetarian but this cookbook is a great. The recipes are surprisingly easy to do for food that is so yummy and pretty. I have not had any trouble finding ingredients for the recipes I have made. I have even made several of the recipes multiple times and am giving this cookbook as a gift to a vegetarian family member this Christmas. My favorite recipe so far is the Garlic Tart and while it is time consuming it is one of the best things I have ever eaten and I made it!<br />Also this cookbook is very well made, it uses high quality paper and the text is very easy to read.
B005LAIHR2|3.0|It was an okay movie for viewing once or twice, but I'm sorry I spent the money to purchase it. I should have just rented.
0802473156|5.0|This book explains why - despite somebody's best effort to express his/her love - their partner feels unloved: They speak different \\"love languages\\"! As I read Dr. Chapman's explanation of the five different ways to express and receive love, and that people only \\"get\\" the expression of love, if it is communicated in the language they understand, I began to see why, after an initial phase of being in love, my relationships ended because we lost our connection. We each did express our love with the gestures and words that meant love to us, but they did not meet the emotional needs of the other person. Wow! And this is such an easy fix, once you know what's going on! And I bet it works in every day life, at work, with friends etc as well.<br /><br />Another amazing relationship book I read recently is [[ASIN:1888043024 How to Have A Match Made in Heaven: A Transformational Approach to Dating, Relating, and Marriage]] by Ariel and Shya Kane. They cover every stage of relationships through conversations with singles and couples - and you can watch the conversations via a link on-line as well! Their advice is fresh, down to earth, sometimes surprising, sometimes humorous, and always compassionate. And since they work as a couple, both genders' perspectives are reflected, which gives extra depth to their suggestions.<br /><br />Both books are well-written and easy and fun to read. Even though they are organized such that you can easily just read one chapter and continue with the next one whenever you have time again, I just found it difficult to put them down.<br /><br />I highly recommend both books for anyone who wants to find new, effective ways to create your next relationship or transform your existing relationship into the relationship of your dreams.
B009KHDT0C|1.0|My mom knew Jonathan Frid, the original Barnabas, and he must be spinning in his grave at this travesty. I know it was a send-up, but the jokes are corny, and even Johnny Depp could not save this movie.
B000S1M9LY|5.0|This book loosely follows the story of an up and coming tennis pro's life at the E.T.A. academy. The book constantly changes pace and follows different threads often making it difficult to keep up in the beginning of the book. One you get into the meat of the story it is well worth the wait.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I never wanted to believe there was a hell.  Now we have evidence that it does not exists.  No reason ever to fear death any more.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Love Rod Stewrt's girie voice and have some of his Great American songbook cd's so needed  one for Xmas music
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Cant wait till next book! The book was really good! If you liked the first one you'll love this one!
B00785P2QC|5.0|amazing game.I love the fact that you can put anything anywhere.my favorite game on the kindle.love it so much! &lt;3
B0086700CM|5.0|it is fun and cool to play.  I like the avatars. and the textures too.  the monkeys are funny also.
B0094OLFUW|4.0|Good album but I like the first one a little better. This album has a little bit more of a sad feel to it.
B008NEMPTO|5.0|This movie was very imaginative. If you have a 3D TV you'll love the format of this film. You have to relax reality while watching this movie, but after awhile, things start to make sense. With the way our government and historians love to cover-up, how do we know it really didn't happen this way???<br />I recommend it highly!!!
B0034G4P1W|4.0|I bought this for my great-grandchildren, it held their attention while they were here. That's the first three I have only seven more to go. The reason that I gave it a four star is because it was not for me it was for them and they seem to enjoy it immensely. The only one that didn't enjoy it is only 18 months old and the noisy parts kept her attention also she would watch the noisy parts then leave to do something else.
0307463745|4.0|I make light of those years when \\"our bodies are changing\\" because the same period happens in a startup business.<br /><br />How many companies have we been introduced to where the conversation is awkward?  It's like being introduced to an acne-ridden tween that is too shy to speak.  Companies are stumbling through the world trying to find their own identity and often fail when they can't.<br /><br />Rework is like a great high school health book, but with more bite.  It catapults you through that `puberty' phase and makes you self-aware and self-assured.  It is quick in its language because the message is simple.  Rework is not there to make building your company take longer by reading through pages of flowery language.  It's there to help you get it DONE.  It is stimulating and catapulting.  It's that pat on the butt from your coach.  After you read it, the journey seems intensely clear and you are excited to launch forward.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book for anyone that feels in a state of business puberty, to anyone that questions what they are doing, and to anyone that can't locate where they are coming from and how they are getting there.  I also highly recommend this book to anyone that dreads the slimy, nauseating writing that often comes with `books about business'.  Rework is clean, crisp, and has grit to it.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|It was slow and boring<br />While I like the actors and actresses in the movie and the work they did<br />It was a lousy vehicle
0345803493|5.0|Well written, still on the first book, can't wait to start this second one.  Great writing.  Wonderful Author, never read anything from E.L. James before.
B000Y1H7VA|4.0|Classic pumpkins. I have always loved this band, This album is no exception. most others will appreciate as well. as well
0345803485|5.0|I've enjoyed what I've read so far.  I didn't know what to expect, having never read anything from this author before, but love the writing.
B00006WKY9|5.0|Great CD. I have seen them in concert and really have always loved their sound. this album is not exception.
B004SKQAJI|5.0|I have watched this dvd more than any other one I have.  A dvd won't wear out like a vhs tape would, so I have a long time to enjoy it more. Michael Flatley returns as Lord of the D ance bought from Amazon.com is a must see.
B000002L9M|4.0|This one is a classic as well. I really dont need to leave a review because I think most people who buy their older stuff know what they are in for..
B004UID2LC|5.0|An awesome app for any one who wants to download youtube videos on their android devices. Best part is that it's free.
B000002G7E|3.0|There is really only a couple of good songs on this one but it was worth a listen..not many complaints, just have to be a follower of VU to get it..
B001F12J48|2.0|Poor 3D effect - Not satisfied. Bad 3D video. Picture is blurry and not clear to view through 3D anaglyphic glasses, causing eye-strain and headache, and had to terminate viewing.
B000002KN8|5.0|You cant go wrong with this classic. I beleive most people know what they are in for when they are buying a classic like this..
B009KHCT94|3.0|Dark humor and at times campy, Iron Sky is a good poke at the USA's political scene and of course, who can resist Nazis from the Dark Side of the Moon?  There is a twist on the Downfall scene that will make meme-lovers laugh.  It certainly evokes the B movie genre with some excellent effects and dark humor.
B000AJJNPY|3.0|Again, You really have to speak Icelandic to appreciate this fully. Other than that one just can appreciate some good tunes..
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Love the Star Wars themed birds - especially the Wooky and the ones with the light sabers!  The levels are &#34;doable&#34; but you're going to have to work at it to get the three star score!
B000006NPY|4.0|This is great music and classic. it goes from soft to heavy, I have always been SP fan for a long time.
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|This is a bit of a challenge.  My 12 year old grandson had too much trouble playing it that he pretty much gave up on it.
B001ACY8D2|3.0|Very long songs. Nice tunes and I dont understand Icelandic like im sure most people dont who buy this album.
B004Z2TUGE|2.0|Not even Dianna Agron or Timothy Olyphant could save this.  I'm not saying it was a complete waste of time, but I'm not not saying that.  Let's see teenage guy that isn't quite human comes into the life of a very attractive young teenage girl.  There is the secrets, the hiding, her finding out and not caring and then some individuals from his circles come into the picture and want to kill them.  Big fight at the end, save the girl, etc...  Plot sound familiar?  If the aliens were vampires and Dianna Agron was a klutzy brunette we'd have Twilight...maybe with better acting though.
B009YU62H2|5.0|Great album, Sounds a lot like their older stuff. I was really impressed. Look forward to their next album hopefully soon.
B003TNQEF0|2.0|The video was not great in terms of quality and I think the script was plodding. Too predictable although the ending was different
B0061TQBRK|5.0|This album was a real suprise, very heavy I really dig their sound. I hope they put out more stuff soon.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|I downloaded this app to my old Tablet running Android 3.0. Everything downloaded and installed fine but it crashes every time I try to download a book. It may be because of my tablet or the version of OS. But repreated attempts with different books got the same result. I get the thumbnails ok and my archives but not the book download.
B004SRPXWQ|4.0|Fun little game for the kids. Wanted something simple and free to occupy them offline. Only problem will be getting them to stop using it on my conversations.
B009D5VNLS|5.0|The animation is outstanding. I would recommend this film to everyone of all ages. It was fun and the character voices were spot on.
B000ID1J0E|5.0|Each time I see this movie, I notice something I'd not seen before. You almost need to be high to &#34;get&#34; the whole movie!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I must admit I was skeptical when I bought this book. Were all those great reviews posted because the book is cheap, and were the reviewers giving it a great quality/price ratio, or is it truly a great story ?<br />Well, I very quickly found out that it is indeed an excellent science fiction novel. The author has created rich and complex characters, and set them in a strange underground world that is so well described, you can almost feel it around you. The story keeps you guessing, and leaves you just enough clues so that you can make intelligent assumptions, but not too many that you can predict the next turn of events. Although the science part of the story is certainly entertaining, the real strength of this story is in the the social relationships between the people living in this strange world.<br />A great read, and best of all there's plenty of room for sequels, can't wait for them to come out !
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|The accents, the fables, the story, the bears....what's not to love. Oh and one can not forget the humor dipped here and there through out.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Yay!  there is finally an app for this! I am a fan of MLP FIM and I finally get to meet pinkie pie! xp
0061537969|5.0|I read this book aloud to my husband on our vacation trip north this summer and continued reading it all the way home.  The reading of it made the miles go faster, but the messages in this story will make an impact on your heart and your mind with the life lessons it showcases. AND you will never look at a dog the same way ever again!  I have bought several more copies to share with family and friends, and I urge readers to put it at the top of their reading list.
B002LF2T4C|2.0|I tired quickly of stumbling intoxicated drugged stupidity. I had hoped see more of the gifted writer and his<br />creativity rather than his drug induced stupor. Alas it was all stupor.
B009VB9VKY|2.0|This movie should never have made it to the theaters!  Acting was awful and amateur....<br />Guys were decent to look at...
0345803493|5.0|This book was a great follow up to book one and left you wanting to read book three. You can't help but root for Christian and Anastasia.
B00000FC5H|5.0|Earth Wind and Fire was a top group in the 70's that lasted for a very long time.  The shows they use to perform were ahead of its time.  Memory lane and great mood setting.
B009SQOGZ2|3.0|Good movie but could done without the gay reference toward the end of the movie. While it may not bother some I just don't feel I need to have a sexual preferences discussion with my 10 yr old after a movie aimed toward kids.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|I really enjoyed this book because it made me aware of an occurrence in history that I was unaware of. I want to thank Tatiana de Rosnay for this. It was a work of art.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Easy to use. Big keyboard and large display. I always have my Kindle Fire close by, so I don't have to search for my calculator.
B007C7UZIG|1.0|It keeps asking me to prove I'm human by typing in a string of characters.  I did so, 6 times, and was very careful to do it right.  It doesn't let me get past this.  Uninstalled because it is a waste of space.
B00A3DZ61W|4.0|Simple, fun and addicting. Like all the Angry Birds games. And for free, its hard to beat. Play this game.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I haven't been able to play this one because my 7 year old son is always playing it!  But he loves it!
B008ZOHCKE|4.0|I like the idea of small notebooks for my writing. I can fill the notebooks quickly and easily. Very easy to use!
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|This game is a little more challenging for me than angry birds, but that's a good thing in my mind.
B009R9WAZ8|4.0|Despite only being the ripe young age of 23, 2012 finds Robyn 'Rihanna' Fenty releasing her seventh studio effort, [[ASIN:B009R9WAZ8 Unapologetic]].  Rihanna's albums have generally garnered favorable ratings with [[ASIN:B00428ZRFE Loud]] being generally considered her weakest (and it was nominated for Album of the Year at the Grammys). Unapologetic doesn't disappoint, finding Rihanna aiming at the naughtiness most exhibited by her transitional 2009 effort [[ASIN:B002UXRH10 Rated R]] while also experimenting more than some previous work. As consistent as 2011's [[ASIN:B005TZFZJC Talk That Talk]], Unapologetic seeks to give Rihanna her first no. 1 album.<br /><br />\\"Phresh Out The Runway\\" shocks as it initiates Unapologetic with slick production from David Guetta, Giorgio Tuinfort and Terius Nash (The-Dream). The chorus is more like a rap hook, repeating \\"phresh out the runway...\\" over and over.  Rihanna trash talks to the max on the gimmicky head-nodder, slicing through profanity after profanity.  She omits the f-bombs on the bridge: \\"I bet you wanna what my crew about/You really wanna know how we get down/Walk up in this b_ like we own this...\\" Attention-getter for sure.<br /><br />\\"Diamonds\\" plays antithesis to \\"Phresh,\\" absent of profanity and generally more refined than the former cut. Rihanna opts for a big number to show off her distinct voice in all its glory.  \\"Shine bright like a diamond,\\" she proclaims on both the intro and outro. A cut that seems extremely subdued for Rihanna upon initial listen, \\"Diamonds\\" grows better with successive listens, unquestionable yielding the no. 1 hit that it is. \\"So shine bright tonight, you and I,\\" she sings on the momentous chorus \\"...we're beautiful like diamonds in the sky/eye to eye, so alive/we're beautiful like diamonds in the sky...\\"<br /><br />\\"Numb\\" finds Rihanna sampling Kanye West (\\"Can't Tell Me Nothing\\") and keeping the tempo slow but lazy much like a southern rap song.  The production can be characterized as hardcore in sound, confirming Rihanna's notion of being, well, unapologetic. \\"Ecstasy in the air I don't care!\\" She states on the first verse. Eminem guests, playing equally into the gimmickry of the cut. Even so, Eminem still gets his twisted rhymes in.<br /><br />\\"Pour It Up\\" finds Rihanna pairing with growing popular hip-hop producer Mike-Will-Made-It (the cut is co-produced by J-Bo).  \\"Throw it up throw it up/watch it fall out/pour it up pour it/that's how we ball out...,\\" Rihanna sings, very much in rebellious, unapologetic fashion. The fingerprints of Rated R's naughty sensibility continues to rear its head throughout the course of Unapologetic.<br /><br />\\"Loveeeee Song\\" is produced and features rapper Future.  Future is in his normal auto-tune infused form, but it works effectively, particularly for this song. \\"I don't wanna give you the wrong impression/I need love and affection/and I hope I'm not sounding too desperate/I need love and affection...,\\" Future contributes on the hook.  Rihanna sings the first two verses while Future receives his own verse (\\"Can you love me for poor/I'm searching for my soul...\\"). On the final iteration of the hook, but Rihanna and Future perform together.  Overall, the cut ends up being catchy and enjoyable, without say beating \\"Diamonds.\\"<br /><br />\\"Jump\\" is production collaboration between Stargate (Ne-Yo, Beyonc&eacute;), Mikey Mike, and Chase & Status. Sampling Ginuwine's \\"Pony,\\" the production continuously grows in crescendoing fashion. Risqu&eacute; as anything else, particularly the hook, Rihanna continues to sell naughty well.  And in case listeners didn't recall the title, the lyric \\"jump\\" is repeated numerous times during the hook section.<br /><br />\\"Right Now,\\" produced by David Guetta, Stargate, Nicky Romero, and Giorgio Tuinfort is even better, sporting electro-centric production work intact with dubstep synths. The vocal production on\\"Right Now\\" is particularly well executed. As for the hook, well Rihanna manages to keep things cleaner than they have been: \\"Tomorrow way too far away/and we can't get back yesterday/but we young right now, we got right now/so get up right now cause all we got is right now...\\"<br /><br />\\"What Now\\" features a lighter, gentler sound during the verses, while taking on a more gargantuan sound on the chorus.  Completely different from previous Rihanna songs, \\"What Now\\" showcases a different side and sound for the singer who is less worried about being a `bad girl' on this cut. The songwriting is very nice here.<br /><br />\\"Stay\\" featuring Mikky Ekko sports a nice sound, but sort of sits where it is ultimately.  Proceeding cut \\"Nobody's Business\\" is a must hear, if for no other reason than it features Rihanna's ex Chris Brown. \\"Nobody's Business\\" is produced by The-Dream and Carlos McKinney and contains smart interpolations of Michael Jackson's \\"The Way You Make Me Feel.\\" A pleasant and groove pop-soul cut, \\"Nobody's Business\\" is all around solid.<br /><br />\\"Love Without Tragedy/Mother Mary\\" like \\"What Now\\" gives Rihanna a different sound the listener hasn't necessarily heard. Epic at 7 minutes, the double cut is well written, produced, and performed (Terius Nash and Carlos McKinney). \\"Mother Mary, I swear I wanna change/Mr. Jesus, I'd love to be queen/but I'm from the left side of an island...\\" are among the most affecting lyrics.<br /><br />The final three cuts of Unapologetic seem to cede some steam but aren't throwaways. \\"Get It Over With\\" sports the same mysterious vibe that many cuts on Unapologetic possesses. \\"No Love Allowed\\" is a modern flashback to Rihanna's more tropical-pop days, produced by standout veteran producer NO ID.  Closing cut \\"Lost in Paradise\\" features an all-star songwriting team to pleasantly close the effort.<br /><br />Overall, [[ASIN:B009R9WAZ8 Unapologetic]] is another solid Rihanna album. Consistent along the lines of Talk That Talk, Rihanna continues to allure with her brand of urban-pop that allows her to also take risks or scale back with both means being successful.  A scattered tone-poem it may be, Rihanna gets her point across easily on the fine Unapologetic.hings cleaner than they have been: \\"Tomorrow way too far away/and we can't get back yesterday/but we young right now, we got right now/so get up right now cause all we got is right now...\\"<br /><br />\\"What Now\\" features a lighter, gentler sound during the verses, while taking on a more gargantuan sound on the chorus.

B007IXWL2C|2.0|I'm so glad to be done with this trilogy. This book was just as boring as the other two. I skipped through half of the book. I only enjoyed the part of the book that was in Christian's words. So not sure what the hype was with any of these books.

B006G3MZRQ|5.0|This movie had me at hello. The pain and love between the brothers and their dysfunctional relationship with their dad was oozing off the screen. I felt the pain. My heart ached for them right to the end. A must-see tearjerker with a down and dirty swag. I loved it!!!!!!!!

B0050DIWFC|5.0|What would you do?  The question keeps arising as you live through the eyes of this family and the tragedy they are experiencing.  The twists and turns keep you engrossed from beginning to end.
B00003CXAT|5.0|Love love LOVE this movie!  I watched the VHS so much I wore it out!  Now with the new and improved DVD version, it is totally awesome!  Just like watching it in the theatres!  This is by far the best of the series.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Just not much plot and doesn't really hold your interest.  Wish they had more of a plot instead of just sex.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|I really wanted to review this when I finished it but it's been a busy couple of months so I'm a little late...<br /><br />I've always loved time travel stories (who doesn't?) and I've always been fascinated by the JFK assassination. I've read several non-fiction books about the event--some focused on the conspiracy theories, others on the details of what was known about Oswald, Ruby, Tippit, et al. I've seen many films and TV shows about the event (Quantum Leap did an amazing 3-episode arc where Sam kept leaping in and out of Lee's body; The X-Files blamed the whole thing on CSM; I even vaguely recall a [possibly] made for TV movie about a man who wanted to go back & save Kennedy because his brother was killed in Vietnam and he thought saving JFK would save his brother [or something]). Obviously, when I heard what Stephen King's latest novel was about, how could I resist?!<br /><br />Simple answer: 849 pages<br /><br />But, thanks to this and Under the Dome, I bought myself a Kindle and after a year, I finally bought the ebook copy of 11/22/63 and devoured the book in three weeks. It's so much more than a time travel story about saving JFK. King creates a series of characters (not nearly as many as there were in Under the Dome, but still pretty many) that you grow to love (and sometimes hate).<br /><br />The setup is simple-Jake Epping, a divorced English teacher, is given the mission of preventing JFK's assassination using a time portal that connects present day to September 9, 1958. This means living in the past for over 5 years, but it's not as simple as you would think. You see, \\"the past is obdurate;\\" it doesn't want to be changed. The novel becomes a sort of video game where Jake has to try his hand at changing smaller events before building up to the \\"big boss\\" of Lee Harvey Oswald. There is even a game over/reset option of coming back to the present and going back to September 9, 1958 again to try again.<br /><br />The events Jake has to change, the peoplehe meets, the woman he falls in love with and the eventual fateful day are all so real, I sometimes had to remind myself this was just a novel and not really possible. King does amazing work with the details he put into the historical portions (thanks to years of research; King actually had this idea all the way back in 1971 before he published his first novel, Carrie), and when you think the story's over, it's actually just starting to get interesting.<br /><br />I've found King sometimes has a great idea that fizzles out into a disappointing ending, but this is definitely one of his best. Even two months later, I remember a feeling of \\"Well, of course that's how it had to end. Just perfect\\" while not predicting the ending at all. If you have any interest in JFK, this book is for you. If you like pondering the hows and whys of time travel, this book is for you. If you like swing dancing, sports betting, historical dramas, love stories, teachers or references to It, this book is for you.<br /><br />Go. Read. It. (\\"It\\" referring to 11/22/63. I've yet to read Stephen King's It)
B009MCRHH6|5.0|This game is both fun and challenging. I played this game on someone else's tablet but couldn't get it on mine at the time.  I was excited to see it was now available.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone serious about improving their health or suffering from a malady for an unknown reason. I think the author is on to something here.
1563894696|5.0|This story stands up well on its own, forget that the Dark Knight movie used many references from it; its a great read from beginning to end.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|Seem to be excellent although I have not checked the longevity.<br />Will buy again if needed.<br />Sent rapidly and arrived fine.
B00684J49U|4.0|If you want to collect Grey's sets, I guess then you will love it.  Although you can probably see most episodes online now.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|I have not been intrigued by any ongoing series on tv in many years until Homeland. The series Homeland is definitely intriguing & so well written. The actors are outstanding, and the production each week is phenomenal. Each segment keeps me hanging on for more!
1401223176|5.0|Hush is a great story and read for the Batman fan, and the artwork is cleanly done and very memorable.

B009OYSFDM|5.0|This is a really fun show for the whole family.  We love it!  Not too violent, not many swear words and easy for the kids to watch.
B00407PNY2|4.0|Great chase - no CGI, nifty old cars and city settings. McQueen is the King of Cool.  Can't miss if this is your thing.
B008HTQ28K|2.0|This has to be one of the most useless purchases that I have made. The only reason I finished it is co I never leave a book unfinished.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|Outstanding movie, special effects and acting  are first class. I only wish I had known it was available in 3D, as I would have bought that version.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|held my interest from the beginning.  John Cory continues to add humor and spice to the novel.  The twisted plot makes for a very good read.  Not disappointed at all.  The basic theme of the story could not have been more timely, considering the terrorist attack in Libya.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|The special effects are great, good plot and lots of action. The home theater just gets better and better with the audio / video quality that this movie is full of.
B009YU62H2|4.0|What a great step backwards, I wasn't quite sure how I would like the new release, but it didn't disappoint.
B006CBSE86|5.0|This album is haunting, powerful, beautiful and emotive. Technically excellent and precise. Well recorded. Amazing singing. I freakin love it.

B0079XNWQA|5.0|Jason Mraz is a great song writer and musician. i enjoy his music very much.  all these words make this process impossible
B0047WJ12K|3.0|This movie was really deep, hard to follow and to understand fully., but the special affects was excellent. i think some people would enjoy it.

B00926J3K6|5.0|This is a review of the Fifteen (15) Disc 40th Anniversary Box.<br /><br />First, a few notes about the album proper (if you are familiar with the album, by all means, skip ahead).  Larks' Tongues In Aspic, King Crimson's fifth studio album (released nearly forty years ago, in 1973), is the first of three studio albums featuring what many -- including this reviewer -- consider to be Crimson's finest line-up of musicians, the mid-1970s trio of founding member Robert Fripp (guitars and mellotron), John Wetton (vocals [Crimson's best vocalist other than Greg Lake] and bass) and Bill Bruford (drums [fresh off recording Yes' Fragile and Close To The Edge]).  Joining them as Crimson members on this album are David Cross (violin and flute [Cross also appeared as a guest on Red]) and Jamie Muir (percussion and \\"all sorts\\" [of sounds]).  This quintet only performed together for one tour and this one album.  Other than possibly Crimson's incredible debut album, and arguably Red and Discipline, Larks' Tongues may well be Crimson's best effort, and is one of the most outstanding, and certainly one of the most unique, of the so-called \\"progressive rock\\" albums of the 1970s.  If I could listen to only one Crimson album - this would be it.  This is not, however, music for the faint of heart.  It is an amalgam of hard rock, folk, classical and more than all of the foregoing, free form jazz.  In fact, listening to the improvisations featured on this set reminded me of the Mahavishnu Orchestra (although as virtuosic as the playing is here, it is a notch below the Mahavishnu band).<br /><br />The album is bookended by the two parts of \\"Larks' Tongues In Aspic\\" (really two different songs), instrumental exercises which contain some terrific playing, and, with Part I, move from quiet passages to a musical assault that makes Black Sabbath seem tame.  (Warning to those playing the album for the first time or who, as I did, simply turn the volume up too high; do not play the quiet intro on \\"Larks' Tongues In Aspic Pt. I\\" too loud - the drums and guitar assault that follows will hit your speakers and you like a freight train, like that old Maxell cassette tape ad).  In between the two title tracks lie two beautiful ballads, \\"Book of Saturday\\" and \\"Exiles\\" (one of Crimson best songs), each of which features John Wetton's smooth vocals and Robert Fripp's creative guitar leads (using tape loops).  \\"Exiles\\" also features Bill Bruford's signature drum tone and David Cross' beautiful violin parts.  \\"Easy Money,\\" which contains some terrific vocals, follows, and features a ferocious Fripp guitar workout, and \\"The Talking Drum,\\" an instrumental which starts quietly and slowly increases in volume, concludes with some terrific guitar tone from Fripp (foreshadowing the tone of his lead on \\"Providence,\\" on Red), never seems to really takes off, but does lead, rather dramatically, to \\"Larks Tongues In Aspic Pt. II,\\" one of Crimson's signature songs, which in itself closes out the album in dramatic fashion.<br /><br />Now, on to this supposedly limited [to 7,000 copies; we'll see if that actually holds true] edition, fifteen disc (13 CDs, 1 DVD-A and 1 Blu-ray DVD) 40th anniversary issue of the album, which purportedly contains every single \\"known\\" recorded note of the LTIA quintet.<br /><br />This lavish package is housed in a very attractive sort of laminated hard box, slightly larger than an LP, featuring the striking original UK album cover (the US release did not have the red border, and is depicted as the cover of the booklet contained in this package).  Inside are five tri-fold CD packages, each housing three CDs.  For this kind of money, digipak holders would have been preferable to make handling of the CDs easier.  The package also contains non-essential but nice memorabilia, including the aforesaid large booklet containing an interview with Robert Fripp and other prose and pictures, an album sized print of the UK album cover, postcard sized pictures of the band members, a facsimile ticket stub and copies of promotional material.  (The materials permit one to download some additional live material that is purportedly of very poor sound quality - given the sound quality of some of the live material included here I have not bothered).<br /><br />What about the musical and video content?<br /><br />The discs are organized chronologically, so that if you listen to them in sequence, you can appreciate the development of the material.  The first nine CDs contain recordings taken from Crimson's fall 1972 tour of Germany and the UK, at which the Larks' Tongues material was premiered, prior to the recording of the album in early 1973, performed in the same sequence as the songs on the album (much like the Dead perfected the material on Live Dead).  The live performances include some pretty intense jams in between each of the songs.  Seven of these nine CDs are remastered audience bootlegs, and the sound quality ranges from nearly unlistenable to just plain poor.  The other two CDs are soundboard cassette recordings which have somewhat better, but certainly not audiophile, sound quality.  Much of the material on these discs has already been released, either as CDs or as downloads, through Crimson's website.  In spite of the extremely limited sonics, amongst the noise on these CDs are some terrific musical performances that showcase the virtuosity of this group of musicians (including some truly terrific guitar playing from Fripp, lovely violin playing from Cross, powerful bass from Wetton and drumming from Bruford and \\"all sorts\\" of sounds from Mr. Muir).  Fans of Crimson and of this particular album will appreciate hearing these performances and having them collected together in a set.  Whether the seven CDs of poorly recorded audience bootlegs will be listened to more than just once, well that will depend on the listener.  The two soundboard cassette recordings are more likely candidates for repeated listening.<br /><br />The sound quality dramatically improves once we get to disc 10, called \\"Keep That One, Nick,\\" which contains one 70 plus minute track of the band laying down the album tracks in the studio, and includes some terrific material in excellent sound.<br /><br />Disc 11 contains the 30th anniversary re-master of the original album mix, which, after listening through all of the bootlegs, sounds pretty damn good.  Most Crimson fans likely already own this re-master which was released in 2004.  This disc does add some bonus material, however, a U.S. radio advert for the album, and the content of a U.S. promotional EP, containing edits of \\"Easy Money,\\" \\"Exiles,\\" and the complete \\"Larks Tongues In Aspic Pt II.\\"  The bonus material will likely be listened to just once.<br /><br />Disc 12 is the DVD that will also come in the standard CD + DVD 40th Anniversary release (which as of this writing, has not yet been officially released in the U.S.).  This disc features Steven Wilson's 2012 5.1 surround sound re-mix of the album (the 5.1 re-mix has been the feature of each of Crimson's 40th Anniversary releases).  This reviewer, however, does not own a 5.1 surround system or a DVD-A player (required for the audio tracks), so I will focus on the video content only (in mono sound).  The video, which is not up to today's standards of quality, is taken from a studio performance in a Bremen, Germany, and appears to be created for television broadcast (the last track is in fact a television broadcast).  Some of the video is edited so that the screen presents montages of different performers.  A great deal of video focuses is on Jamie Muir, whose contribution consists mostly of adding sounds, but who is very animated.  As unusual as Muir is, it is nice to see the performances of rest of the band, most of whom must have been in their twenties at the time.  The material included is a lengthy improv, a shortened version of \\"Exiles\\" and two shortened performances of \\"Larks' Tongues In Aspic Part I.\\"  For a set like this, I would have liked a better quality video containing more material.  This, apparently, was all that was available.<br /><br />Disc 13 contains alternative versions and/or re-mixes (mostly by Steven Wilson) of the album's songs, sequenced in the same order as the album.  This disc, in excellent sound quality, is a really nice addition to the set, and although certainly not essential, it does contain some excellent tracks.  The alternative take of \\"Book of Saturday\\" features just Wetton's vocals and Fripp's backing guitar; the excellent remix of \\"Exiles\\" presents an instrumental featuring a heavy emphasis on mellotron and acoustic guitar (until the lead guitar comes in, this sounds like it could have been an outtake from one of the first two Crimson albums) and there are two versions of \\"Easy Money,\\" one of which is just Jamie Muir making sounds and the other a most worthwhile alternate take featuring, as does the original, a Fripp guitar workout.<br /><br />Disc 14 contains Steven Wilson's 2012 stereo re-mix/re-master of the original album.  It is phenomenal.  The album just sings.  The re-mix maintains, and even enhances, all of the terrific dynamics that made this album so special, contrary to all of the re-mastered CDs that are simply just louder.  The detailing, the imaging, the clarity are all fantastic.  You will hear music that was either buried in the mix or not included before.  In short, this is one of the best re-mixes/re-masters of a classic album that you are likely to hear.  For anyone who loves this album, this one disk -- in whatever set you obtain it in -- is a must buy.  Like Disc 12, this disc (perhaps with some other bonus material from this set) will also be included in the standard CD + DVD release.<br /><br />Disc 15 is a blu-ray DVD, which contains a boatload of material: the video content featured on the DVD-A, in slightly better quality; numerous versions of the album [the featured 2012 5.1 surround sound remix, the awesome 2012 stereo re-mix (also on CD 14), and the 30th Anniversary re-master (also on CD 11) (each of which also appear on the DVD-A), as well as the original UK vinyl transfer and the original US vinyl transfer]; the session reels from CD 10, and the alternate takes and re-mixes from CD 13.  Additionally, on the blu-ray, as on the DVD-A, one can also listen to some or all of the audio material in several different audio formats.  Although I do own a blu-ray player -- which because of its HD video capabilities is a more popular format than DVD-A --I have not yet listened to much of the audio on the blu-ray disc, as the CD re-mastering -- of the studio material -- is quite fine.  The blu-ray disc is only available in this box set, and for those with a 5.1 surround sound system and a blu-ray player -- but not a DVD-A player -- this is a significant bonus to purchasing the box set, as the 5.1 mix can be enjoyed without purchasing another piece of hardware (Steven Wilson's 5.1 mixes have received rave reviews).<br /><br />So, is the box set worth it?  If you are a serious fan of Crimson's music, and of this album in particular, and you have the dough, perhaps, as this is undoubtedly a really nice collection.  If you have a 5.1 system, a blu-ray player, but not the capability to play DVD-A discs, the blu-ray disc adds value to this set.  This is a collector's box, however, and most of these discs (many of which are bootlegs of poor sound quality) will not get much playing time.  For anyone else, the soon to be released CD + DVD set will serve just fine, and will present one of \\"progressive\\" rock's best and most unique albums that - even without a 5.1 system -- can be enjoyed in absolutely stellar sound.  For now at least, the 2012 re-mix/re-master is the \\"definitive edition.\\"<br /><br />© 2012 D.A.

B00917IQFY|2.0|To wit: SNAKE OIL CAPITAL OF THE WORLD is a hit....sounds a bit like Sam the Sham and the Pharoahs but with more bottom; LAST BOOKSTORE IN TOWN would make a nice Elvis Costello B-side, if they still existed; OLD SOUL has that Dylan effect; COATHANGERS (good at about 3:00, bad at 5:10; but I hope it's not about the latest talk about overturning Roe v. Wade) also has that Dylan effect (\\"the vandals took the handles\\"), but is only fair.<br /><br />I'm not a fan or an historian of Parker and the Rumour...yet I appreciate an \\"organic\\" sound amidst all the electro-mechanical extavagance today - and all the \\"comeback\\" junk from the megastars. As Casey Stengel would say, You could look it up.<br /><br />Still, something as engaging as the midtempo LONG EMOTIONAL RIDE sounds, depressingly, too much like a combo of HELLO SUNSHINE by Aretha Franklin and HURT SO GOOD by John Melloncamp, to be really taken seriously. Not that these numbers are poor (presumptive) reference discs. The album \\"Howlin' Wind\\", going way back in GP's career, also had alot of that\\"borrowed\\" feel....I don't dig it. The man simply does not have a distinctive voice and I find alot of his material to be very derivative. I would not mention his name in the same paragraph as Declan McManus'. (Sorry, fans).<br /><br />Yet, in the end, Parker and his group do make New Wave sound \\"new\\" on this deal and that's pretty cool. But, fellas, \\"mall attire\\"? (look at that cover shot). Where's the latte and shades and sandals? Left 'em in the Jag'?<br /><br />[this review mostly based upon Amazon samples]

After current problems will give it a 1.

1451620829|3.0|Sure it is captivating to read- like in a watching a train wreck happen sort of way, but the lesson here is that a man with so many opportunities wasted them on instant gratification in drugs, sex and material things. Peter Criss comes off as a dullard who never understands that the person responsible for one's happiness in life is yourself.<br />  To think I admired these guys back in the day. I still like the early music, but after reading what Ace and Peter told their scribes to write, I could not give either of them the time of day. (Criss is certainly illiterate)<br />  The stories of touring with the band are interesting and one can only conclude that Stanley and Simmons kept the gig going long enough to make millions. Criss comes off like a spoiled brat who cannot make any good decisions, personally or professionally because he is too busy snorting coke, trusting equally flawed women, and just feeling sorry for himself. Hey Peter here are some new words for you to learn: hedonism and narcissism.<br />  When you finish a book like this, you realize just how empty the lives of these rockers can be.<br />I felt  dirty just from reading it.

B007X4ECLY|3.0|\\"Lockout\\" is executive-produced and co-written by Luc Besson. Perhaps this alone tells you everything you need to know about the film, of which basic idea looks like a curious mixture of \\"The African Queen\\" and \\"The Rock.\\" \\"Lockout\\" is just another derivative action film from Besson's film company EuropaCorp, but thanks to the enjoyable performances from always reliable Guy Pearce, \\"Lockout\\" is mindless entertainment that is barely watchable.<br /><br />In the year 2079, a CIA agent Snow is wrongly accused of murdering his friend and fellow agent. To clear his name, Snow agrees to rescue U.S. President's daughter Emilie Warnock (Maggie Grace) trapped inside MS1, a maximum security space prison taken over by 500 inmates.<br /><br />Please don't ask me how come a state-of-the-art maximum security prison (made with the latest technologies) can be easily taken over by the prisoners. There are so many plot holes and head-scratchingly stupid decisions. Please don't say \\"Star Wars\\" if you watch the silly climactic combat scenes (apparently there would be no guided missiles in the future).<br /><br />Action sequences by directors James Mather and Stephen St. Leger Watch are at best passable, but the film is still memorable for the lively performances of Guy Pearce as one-man army Snow. He is fun to watch throughout.

At this point I would not know the titles of the songs when the music plays, but I'm willing to learn by listening more & at high volume.<br />In fact today I'm hopping in my car head to the DIY store & blast it as high as I can with the windows closed until my sunglasses shatter or I have some hearing loss or whichever comes first.
030758836X|3.0|This book is fairly well-written with a good story behind it that grips you from the very first few chapters. But as I kept going the story became way too predictable. I felt the author was attempting to put in twists, but after one or two they all slowly dropped into the same scheme and were easily guessed early on. The ending left me a bit disappointed. I wanted more. I could have liked the ending if other information was offered. It's almost as if some of the characters got off too easy, if that makes sense. I'm all for both happy and unhappy endings, but only if the author gives good reason for them, not leaving anything in question.
B008PCVGKI|5.0|This is an outstanding, methodical review of the deceptive practices of pharmaceutical companies, researchers, doctors, journal publishers and regulatory agencies - many of whom grossly inflate and distort the research evidence for the benefits of medications.<br /><br />Ben Goldacre carefully explains research procedures and how they are intended to guide caregivers and careseekers to the best possible treatments for their problems. He then methodically demonstrates how all of those who are assumed to be advising the public and protecting us from harm fail miserably<br />in practice.<br />* Drug companies, researchers and journals publish research studies with positive results but have a strong history of withholding from publication studies with negative results.<br />* Many doctors, researchers, hospitals, medical schools, journals and media receive substantial financial support from pharmaceutical companies - which is clearly a conflict of interest when it comes to protecting the public from information that is unfavorable to the drug companies.<br />* Withholding negative results of research may lead to serious harm when drugs are given that not only are ineffective but that may also have harmful of lethal effects.<br />* Drugs are allowed to be prescribed for clinical uses which have not been approved by regulatory authorities, much less examined in research.<br /><br />Goldacre suggests many fixes for these problems. Most prominent among these is to set stricter research reporting guidelines and to enforce them. Sadly, drug companies, regulatory agencies and doctors have claimed that such guidelines are in place and are working well. Goldacre amply demonstrates that this is untrue. Transparency and public auditing are essential to fixing these dangerous problems. This is difficult to achieve because of the vast financial resources of the drug companies (along with the complicit medical establishment and regulatory agencies) that are systematically working to continue the current dangerous practices.<br /><br />Sadly, in his discussions of how people come to believe things that are not true, Goldacre uses the example of precognition. He disparages any belief in the ability to foretell the future, citing a single positive study of Daryl Bem with several replications that showed no positive findings. From this he concludes that there is no evidence to support claims of foreknowledge. In this instance, Goldacre himself demonstrates that which he decries: a selective presentation of evidence to support one's claims.

Sadly, in his discussions of how people come to believe things that are not true, Goldacre uses the example of precognition. He disparages any belief in the ability to foretell the future, citing a single positive study of Daryl Bem with several replications that showed no positive findings. From this he concludes that there is no evidence to support claims of foreknowledge. In this instance, Goldacre himself demonstrates that which he decries: a selective presentation of evidence to support one's claims. There is a substantial and robust body of parapsychology literature, including a meta-analysis with very robust results (p < 10 x 10-24 = odds against chance of 10 million billion billion to 1), confirming that people are able to predict the future accurately (Honorton & Ferrari, 1989).

B008AK8FHM|3.0|I just lost my father and thought this was good book for those wondering if there is something after this life on earth.  I especially liked that a medical doctor gave his scientific view of what happened and linked it to his personal life.  I thought the ending was abrupt.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|This is by far the greatest radio app for use on iPad, Kindle Fire, or Google Nexus 7...I use it practically 24 hours a day. At night, I find a music station to play at low column all night while I sleep.<br />Currently, I am using a station that plays all Bach music.<br />I have a favorite sports talk show that is not on local radio in my area; so, I tune in TUNEIN to a station in Virginia to listen at 8 AM or catch the same show later at 1 PM on a station in Oregon.<br />News? What a great app this is for that! I was listening to a NYC station during the Hurricane Sandy disaster...I live in the South on the Gulf Coast.<br />There is a station in Paris, France that I listen to that mixes Jazz and Classical music together 24/7...excellent unique listening.<br />Great app...even the free one is just fine.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|Love the retro music.  Would give it to my children who are in their 30's and 40's.  Saw a show on '60 Minutes' on Rodriguez and absolutely had to have the music.  Will get all of his albums.
B007SSEBCU|2.0|I admire Mrs Thatcher, very much.  I found this to be very sad and a bit depressing.  It's the way the writer and/or director chose us to view Mrs. Thatchers thoughts, ways and life style. I haven't read any memoires or other books about her, yet, but I would rather see her strong.
B00AAZSH0U|5.0|It is a very nice book. I would recommend this strongly. Nice pictures and sounds. Excellent for pre school kids.
B005LJK3AC|5.0|I haven't laughed this hard since bridesmaids. If you are looking for a raunchy comedy that will have you in stitches, this is a good one to watch.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this is a awesome game u should get 1 its free 2 its beastly 3go to the appetite and get it nnnnnnoooooowwww
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Very cute! Great for the whole family, and of all ages! Also a very wonderful message for agents and kids!
B009NQKPUW|5.0|my 13 yr old son has been anxious to see this movie since his grandpa told him all about it! must see!
B0063GORYU|5.0|interesting game makes you think and pay attention to detail, organize your moves,  developing  your own strategy and game plan. just like real live.
B001K3K5MO|5.0|This is one of those movies I can watch over and over. It has comedy, action, drama and some great music.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|A friend of mine told me to read this book. He told me it was his favorite book, and coming from someone who's read hundreds of books, I was impressed. I haven't read nearly as many books but it was still an amazing book and a fascinating story.
B004LWZW9C|4.0|Very nice, easy, enjoyable film filled with celebrities from start to finish, some only for a second or so.  If you like Valentines day, you won't be disappointed.
B009NQKXYK|3.0|This is an ok movie if you are a science fiction fan. Not a classic by any means. Character development is almost non-existant, but that seems to be par for the course in action movies these days.
B00A3YTC6Q|5.0|I loved the dancing and the story was really not bad at all. Also, the acting was better than the previous 2 movies. It was almost on par with the first movie. I have watched it a few times already!
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|My family and I love this movie.  While I love the fairy tale  stories, what I love most about Brave is that Merida does not need a prince to save her.  She saves her family herself.
B004JN1CW4|4.0|Slightly let down about how it ended but overall I was very impressed with how, unlike the hunger games, the 3rd book was just exciting as the 1st
B008JGSM6G|5.0|at my school they have flow on the ipods and EVERYONE wants to play it. thank you for your time.
0451418441|5.0|World Without End is yet another wonderful story from Ken Follett in which the author has woven another unforgettable tale from ancient England with fascinating characters. The book is a sequel to the immensely popular \\"Pillars of the Earth.\\" Most of the critics of this book complain that the story if different than \\"Pillars\\" and that all of the characters seem to have some flaws. It seems to me that it is senseless to compare the two books. After all, they are different books. This sequel stands on its own as an excellent book. It has become one of my favorites, along with Pillars.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|My son wanted this on his Kindle, so he could have the Bible with him all the time. He loves having access anywhere he goes.
0131103628|5.0|This is a great book for those looking for a strong foundation in the basics.  I bought this book to replace one I lent a friend
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Awesome! My son loves this game! He is any Angry Bird follower. He begged me to buy this for him before Christmas.
B0054SMID0|5.0|Love it. Great plot. Mathew is an awesome actor. Kept me on the edge of my couch  the whole movie.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Creepiest tv show ever!.  Keeps you guessing and lives up to the hype.  Can't wait for the next episode!  Epic!
B0091XRL86|2.0|My husband and I enjoy Wallace and Gromit, so we were a bit disappointed with this movie. They put a lot of work into the great visuals, but the story wasn't the best. The movie wasn't holding our attention, and it seemed to drag. We didn't turn it off, but we did decide to do some chores while watching the last half of it. We also thought that the horrible depiction of Queen Victoria (which was meant to be funny), just came across as stupidly offensive. Maybe this movie would be more entertaining for a very young audience.
B003NS2T9G|5.0|Leave it to the BBC to create this series!  The idea behind Torchwood is original and the characters are fun!!!  Watch the premiere and you'll be hooked!!!
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Upgraded from the regular small intel 1366 heat sink and dropped my cpu temp by about 30 C.  Was running at 70 C before now staying around 40.  Great buy.
1476712042|5.0|I am speechless, I cannot tell you how much I love this book. It has such dramatic twist you'll be at the edge of your seat at all times... I am utterly in love with Travis... If you're in emotional roller coaster reads, you'll love this Beautiful Disaster!!!!
034580404X|1.0|Mad and really upset I paid for these books! I was so disappointed, who doesn't like to read about sex if well written and part of a good plot? But this was ridiculous! 99.9 percent of these books are them having sex to the point of being nauseating. I found myself skipping over the sex parts from being so bored by it. (And I am not prude) How in the world did these books get on the best selling list? I love to read and read a variety of books but I would really like to know of those people who read, not just &#34;sex&#34; books, how many really enjoyed these??<br />Sorry I paid the money...
0425263908|5.0|I am now utterly obsessed with the crossfire novels, you'll learn to love Guideon and learn to understand Eva... Great read, if you lived Fifty you'll definitely live this one!!!
B003SI9WYG|5.0|This film was probably one of my favorites of all time. the animation was fantastic for it's time and the writing and humor blew me away. the renting rate was good, as it allowed me to watch this film form home.
1567184855|5.0|This book will change your life. You will discover how much of what you will learn is in line with concepts and ideas you have already been taught or know of. What you will find here is a universal truth or universal translation of MANY ideologies. My hope would be that everyone would read this book.
B00009V7P8|5.0|The wonderful cd from my most favorite singer- Damien Rice. A very happy shopping experience.<br />thanks very much! Best wishes!
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|very impressed with the writing and animation. the triplets deserve their own animated short! highly recommend for any age to see!
B0007IPBD6|5.0|The wonderful cd from my most favorite singer- Damien Rice. A very happy shopping experience.<br />thanks very much! Best wishes!
B009B4ZEKM|5.0|I bought \\"Lotus\\" as a gift for my Girlfriend, i placed the order and it arrived quickly to Mexico (Obviously where i live). I'm no fan of Christina Aguilera but she loves her with all her might. As soon as it arrived we played it on my car and i wasn't expecting to be good. Can't say i love it, but the music is nice to hear. She loved it, so much that she plays it every time at her house. The product has a nice detail on the CD and the booklet. The disk arrived perfectly, well enveloped and not a single scratch was present. If you're a Christina Aguilera fan, it's a must. As a Non-Fan, give it a try.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book is the best of the wimpy kid series ,I finished it in 1 day!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It was fandango (a word I made up, it means fantastic!)
B005AKFXZW|5.0|Loved it! I felt like I was in this book from start to finish. The characters come to life from the very beginning. I've since bought a hard copy I loved it so much. Beautiful and colorful writing. I'd love for a sequel - hint hint!
B000I0QL82|5.0|This is my all-time favorite holiday movie.  I had worn out my VHS copy and will happily enjoy the movie for years to come on DVD.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I found this to be a funny and surprisingly moving and thought-provoking film starring some of my favorite actors.  Money well spent.
B0001I561E|5.0|We are replacing our favorite Disney VHS recordings as they come out.  Robin Williams is a stitch and my young adult daughters still enjoy this great classic.
B009WO7NQO|2.0|This is the first Gaming app I put on my Kindle Fire, so I'm relatively new to the Angry Birds Franchise.  While the levels and sounds are super fun, by the time you finish what's available you're left wanting more.  Perhaps that's a good marketing strategy, but you DO have to wait for an update (and hopefully Hoth won't be the only world to appear).  Then you'd have to purchase their Return of the Jedi expansion too (for $1.99).<br /><br />It also uses up a lot of the battery, much more than I'M used to, anyway.  I would wait for a price drop on this app, so pay close attention to those Amazon eMails!
B0088WFZQG|5.0|The movie deserves a 5-star review all on its own, but this review is just to mention that the HD quality looked great.  I would definitely recommend spending a little extra to watch a great film like this in HD.
B0041KKYDI|5.0|it was a good product. The quality was good. the dust cover was not scratched nor the disc. very impressed.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|this is great and you can use it hands free when you choose to. It works great.  I 'm glad I got it too.
B000FL7CAK|4.0|it was a good product. The quality was good. none of the disc were scratched but im kinda unimpressed that i wasnt informed that there was no dust cover.
B008JAGZDE|5.0|We loved it!!  If you loved American Pie, than you are going to love this one as well.  Much better than the dissappointing 2nd movie.
B001PPGAIA|5.0|it was a good product. The quality was good. the dust cover was not scratched nor the disc. very impressed.

B009E3EY38|5.0|It's Been A Long Time Since I Rock N' Rolled! And how i love to watch these guy's stroll. Ok I have had since the show was done a bootleg DVD of the show, The CD's of the show & The CD's of the dress rehearsal. So i already knew this was going to great set. They really did a great job on the DVD. But to hear this mixed and mastered after hearing the bootlegs for all these years is just the icing on the cake. It sounds better then i even imagined. This is the greatest rock band to ever live! And now for all of the younger generation to feel and see some of the magic & see guy's in there 60's blow everyone away & have not really played much together since around 1988 is amazing. You can see them smiling and everyone look's like there having a great time. But when you are sounding that good how can you not be having a great time. I am so proud of Jason Bonham for the job he did on the drums. His father has got to be so proud of him & what a tribute to his fathers legacy. And just remember that Jimmy Page broke his finger & had to push the show 1 month later then it was planed for. Jimmy is playing his gut's out and broke his pinky finger about 2 months before the show. If you like anything by Led Zeppelin This is a must have & when it comes out i will be adding the Vinyl to my collection of this show. Why not i have everything else.-Mike
B000NA2BEU|5.0|it was a good product. The quality was good. the dust cover was not scratched nor the disc. very impressed.
B009AZZEU2|4.0|Since i have bought this CD i can not stop playing it.Too bad this bad stopped when they did. I mean really they sound like they picked up right where they left off on there last album. This is proof that if they had kept going they could of ruled the rock world. It's hard to get tired of Chris's voice. After all the stuff he has done solo & with Audioslave He has Been Away To Long & now he is back home where he belongs.Let's just hope this is not a one time fling & that they get back in the studio and do more. This is a great album but after some touring & being together playing everyday they my work more like the well oiled machine they once were & really blow everyone's mind.
B002BIULQ2|5.0|it was a good product. The quality was good. the dust cover was not scratched nor the disc. very impressed.

B009EELBIS|5.0|A timeless classic:) I never tire of seeing this true life movie classic. I guess that is why they can still charge for it after all these years!
B001EC2ISA|5.0|Tim Burton's Beetlejuice is a classic. The DVD is great. It has a wonderful picture and the movie was a much fun as ever.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Touching, heart-warming journey of likeable characters on the adventure of a lifetime. Share your memories with this group of strangers as they become new friends.
B008O9V4C2|5.0|With each listen this album grows and grows on me. It's no 'Nightfly' but it is an outstanding effort by one of the best of his generation. The formula is intact and not too many chances are taken that veer from the that said formula, but that in the end in not a problem, and for most Dan and Fagen fans, that would be a plus.<br /><br />This is an album to put on, sit back with your favorite adult beverage, and be transported to a more storied place and time.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|The greatest game I'ge ever played!  Getting to find the evidence and the criminal in the game really got me interested into the game series.  It's almost like you're actually in the game!  :D
B008F1NICI|4.0|I've enjoyed many PT releases, some more than others. That said, I feel they've produced stronger material in previous outings. Overall, good, but not great.
B006OAB3ME|5.0|I saw the PBS special about the recording sessions and the concert performance afterwards.  There are so many things to love about this album.  The first is hearing McCartney outside his normal neighborhood.  He seems relaxed, but musically and rhythmically he is absolutely on, a bit like Fred Astaire in that regard.  I was surprised that McCartney's knowledge of songs from an older era.  There aren't that many classics on the program:  Berlin and Arlen are the only two A-listers represented.  But the bench of wonderful American songwriters goes deep.  The song I seem to have taken with me (and driven my wife crazy with) is &#34;I'm Going to Sit Right Down and Write Myself a Letter,&#34; which during the Fifties used to send me up the wall as a relentless &#34;hard-sell,&#34; faux-swinging song in cover after cover.  McCartney delivers the best rendering of that song I've heard -- gently and genuinely swinging.  Diana Krall, her musicians, and guests create a blue-velvet setting around the diamonds of McCartney's vocals.  I realize that the production has an air of self-indulgence about it, but if you can't indulge McCartney, who, other than Tony Bennett and Bonnie Raitt, is worthy?
B009439HP8|3.0|Man, was I disappointed with the quality of this pressing. I was so excited to get it, only to play it and think there must be something wrong with my needle. Muffled, washed out, dull, lacking any crispness at all. I listed to the mp3 download that came with it for comparison and was shocked at how much better is sounded, and that wasn't even the CD but a compressed version of the album! I think The Sword must've ran into some production issues with this pressing and quite possibly the orange swirl composition is not ideal for good recordings.<br />Now side two did sound better than side one, another indication of quality control problems and lack of oversight with regards to the finished product.<br />Frankly I believe the company that issued this recording should send everyone a replacement copy. Now of course it is possible I got a lemon, but I highly doubt that scenario.<br />It's a real shame since the album ROCKS and the Sword are one of the best stoner rock outfits out there right now. I give the packaging and the music itself 5 stars though, but at the end of the day it's all about the actual recorded content, so I wanted this review to serve as a warning to those thinking of buying the actual vinyl.
B009FRG8IW|5.0|Awesome album which makes you feel good just by listening!!! The remixes of older songs with new music is a success!
B002GTZSZU|5.0|This is a story about Mozart's life..he was amazing..It was a bit dark..very well done..I love the music too..and would and have watched it over and over..
B00A7OFVVM|3.0|Every time I watch an episode of season 2 it doesn't make sense.  The two returning characters Kit and sister Jude are mother and son. I'm wondering how the connection between them doesn't exist in season 2.<br /><br />Please provide explanations, thoughts....
0525953728|5.0|Avery good well written account of this one man's life.<br />The title is a little deceiving, as it takes most of the book to get to the mission that kiloed osama ben laden.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Not Jacks best novel and it seems to be taking him a long time to get to Virginia.  I found I was quite confused about the plot as I neared the end of the book but still a good read.
1451696205|5.0|This item arrived very quickly and my daughter was very happy.  I have not read the book but my daughter is the one who wanted it.
B009GEBBNQ|3.0|I love the movie but the sound was terrible. The voices were super low but the music super loud. Seemed like a bad illegal copy.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|Prometheus is a great movie but if you jugde it as a standalone movie it will leave you confused and wanting. In order to understand it you really need to see the Alien movies.It had been several years since I had watched them so I had to play catch up from time to time. I actually didn't fully understand the movie until I watched the special features. Once you understand the movie and the direction the director wanted to take you I promise that you will enjoy it. After this the only real fault with the movie how massive it is. There are so many stories in it that at times I think director Ridley Scott tried doing to much in one movie. If there is another movie or a tv series to compliment Prometheus I think it will turn into a must watch for everyone. The story line is the crew of the Prometheus goes out in space in search of a race called the Engineers. For you Alien buffs out there remember the pilot on the alien ship in the first movie? I won't spoil the story for you just if you liked the Alien movies you really need to watch this. If you can get the 3D version.
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|This is the best performance of Batman. It depicts a darker more reclusive Batman. Heath Ledge as the Joker was stunning. If you liked &#34;Batman Begins&#34; you'll love this. All of the performances were over the top. This review is short because if I wrote everything I liked about this movie I'd be writing a review as large as &#34;War and Peace&#34; Buy this you won't regret it.
B008B3GP2A|5.0|I'm not surprised. I've loved Maroon 5 for years. Fun to listen and sing to in the car! I think if you liked Songs about Jane...you'll also enjoy Overexposed
B00A9Q70Y4|5.0|Woke up in the middle of the night after killing 4 walkers -  and then one got me. Pretty amazed that at my age (43) this show can get me startled and wide awake from a deep sleep after having not seen an episode for days. Great actors, great production staff, such an awesome movie.
B004Z2TUGE|1.0|I love Sci-Fi films, and I'm usually willing to forgive quite a bit in order to get the the kernels of what makes the premise of a film interesting or entertaining, but this is not one of those times.<br /><br />Starring Dianna Agron, of 'Glee' fame (you may know her as Glee's Quinn Fabray), and Alex Pettyfer, of the film 'Beastly' (a teen drama VERY loosely based on the premise of 'Beauty and the Beast'), and his most recent role in 'Magic Mike', 'I AM FOUR' takes liberties with the Science Fiction genre to create what I can only think of as an incredibly weak hybrid of 'E.T. the Extraterrestrial' meets 'Starman' meets 'Twilight', with a heavy dose of forlorn teen love drama at its center.<br /><br />While there are scattered scenes throughout the film that might be mistaken as suspenseful, the overall effect left me feeling like I just swallowed a sugary dose of a made-for-the-Disney Channel 'I Was A Teenaged Space Man' afternoon special.  It was just plain bad.  No... it was REALLY bad.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT:<br />Sadly, the opening sequence really grabbed my attention, and I made the mistake of thinking that maybe... just MAYBE any other scene in the film might replicate that same heightened tension.  Unfortunately, nothing else compared.<br /><br />The beginning of the film starts out with a high-tension suspense sequence in a ramshackle hut in some remote tropical jungle setting ALA 'Predator'.  The hut's occupants are being stalked by something, filmed supposedly through the eyes of the antagonist of the scene.  The young, scrub-faced teen occupant of the hut is warned of the approaching menace via some alleged 'alien artifact' he's wearing on his person (similar to E.T.'s 'heart-light').  Whatever is stalking this boy and his supposed 'guardian' quickly dispatches them both, with an accompaniment of gutteral growls and snarls implying that whatever this creature is-- it's large, dangerous, and lethal.<br /><br />My interest was piqued.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the film quickly transforms into a rebellious-teen-alien-goes-rogue-as-he-falls-for-the-small-town-girl-he's-forbidden-to-see scenario.  If you slapped some pasty white make-up on his face and made him sparkle in the sun, he could be another Edward Cullen all over again.  Oh, wait.  He's got an 'alien artifact' too, and it DOES sparkle and glow at inopportune times.  Gosh, that's original.<br /><br />Throw in some high school rivalry, the 'bad guy' jock character that used to date the small town girl and ruined her reputation, and the cute-but-geeky 'loner' sidekick, and you've got the makings of another formulaic piece of teen drama crap that is better left for the bargain bin.<br /><br />Better yet, just save yourself the trouble and avoid this dungheap altogether-- you'll just be asking for your time, and your money, back.
B005PZ85SO|5.0|I enjoyed watching season 7.  Season 8 is slow to start and not as exciting.  (Not sure about the replacement for Prentiss)  She doesn't fit.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|great for killing time and the movement button is great and they just updated the potions and daily chest. a game you can get into and create your own character with what they give you.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This historical drama deftly pulls the reader in from the first page and catapults her through countless emotional up and downs. Count on a few too-late nights unable to put the book down!
B0088RQ4X4|2.0|Right up there with Snow White and the Huntsman as worst movie I've seen this year.  Clearly, no one at Disney was paying attention as this debacle was being filmed
B0090O07RS|2.0|The doors are one of my favorite groups. I was disappointed I never got to go to this concert. Not disappointed anymore, the doors in concert are boring. Also disappointed in the quality of Blu-ray on the older concerts.
B00AA7O6QC|4.0|Statham, Stallone, Arnold, Bruce Willis et al in the same movie for the 2nd time!  It's action hero heaven.  No, the plot is older than the stars of the movie, there are a whole lot of contrivances BUT, it's a good time.  Great one liners from the star's old movies and some excellent action.<br /><br />I gave it 4 stars for being true to what it is and having the guts to put all these stars in the same movie
B00A3AUGEW|1.0|I used to buy lots of music but now I cant seem to download it without a long pjome call.  really way too much trouble
B008M34INW|4.0|Gibson has a 2nd decent turn after his 'breakdown'.  Good story and Gibson brings back some of that old charm.  More in the Action genre
043902353X|5.0|After reading the first page, I couldn't put this book down.  It's an easy read, but it is equally entertaining.
B009KKLQKO|3.0|Having seen the Beach Boys live on their 50th Anniversary tour, I was excited when I saw there was a DVD documenting it.  However, one of the things that made the tour so special was that the group played two full sets each night, sometimes playing over 50 songs in one show.  This DVD only has 21 of the songs played on the tour and that doesn't even add up to half of the tour's setlist.  If you didn't see the tour live and you buy this DVD, you miss out on some of the highlights.<br /><br />1. You won't see the touching tributes to the late Carl and Dennis Wilson in which the band backs up video footage of each deceased member singing \\"God Only Knows\\" and \\"Forever\\" respectively.<br />2. You won't see a performance of \\"Add Some Music to Your Day\\" in which all five core members of the group sing around Brian's piano.<br />3. You won't see David Marks play the title track from \\"Pet Sounds\\" solo.<br />4. You won't see Brian Wilson sing \\"I Just Wasn't Made for These Times\\" and \\"Please Let Me Wonder.\\"<br />5. You won't hear some of the classic ballads like \\"Surfer Girl\\" or \\"In My Room.\\"<br /><br />These are the most glaring omissions in my opinion but those aren't the only performances missing from this video.  That's not to say this video still isn't enjoyable.  There's enough here to love including great performances of \\"Heroes and Villains,\\" \\"Sloop John B,\\" \\"Sail On, Sailor\\" and \\"Wouldn't It Be Nice\\" among other hits plus two songs from the somewhat obscure 1972 Carl and the Passions album which are surprising but welcome inclusions.  The band is shown in good form and the video itself is well-shot.<br /><br />There are no bonus features and the DVD lacks a chapter menu so if you want to hear a specific song, you have to press \\"Play All\\" and use the skip button on your remote.  This might bug some people.<br /><br />Overall, this is a fine sampler but should not be seen as the definitive document.  The band deserves better and the fans deserve better.  Hopefully in thefuture, we will see another release from the tour that gives these songs the presentation they deserve and a full concert would be nice.
1407109375|5.0|This book is an easy read, but it is equally entertaining.  I soaked up each word as quickly as possible.
B009YU62H2|5.0|Like previous Soundgarden albums, almost every single song is good, and there are some that are just awesome. Bones of Birds and Black Saturday are my favorites and will be permanent stays on my playlists.
B005COO1X6|4.0|The story is a little like Christine..  a demonic car.  I enjoyed it while it lasted.  There was no real &#34;meat&#34; here though.  I am a huge fan of King but I most enjoy his longer works that are filled with so many details that my mind gets lost to me for days.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Love it! Super fun to play and my kids love it too! It keeps them happy! Thanks for sucha great game.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was quickly lured into reading this entire trilogy within a span of one week.  I love flawed men.  I like a challenge.  I like happy endings.  This book is the begining of what some people would call a warped love affair.  Some of the writing could use a good editing for repetitive purposes but you will not mind that so much when the story starts to unfold.  Christian Grey is your seriously flawed man.  Ana seems weak at first but accepts the challenge of wrangling him.. or is it her who is being wrangled?  As for the happy ending...  you will have to read it and see.  You will love/hate Christian by the end.  There are very descriptive sex scenes.  If you arent into that, you will NOT like these books.  There is a much deeper story that I enjoyed alot but if you are sex shy.. it may not be worth it to you.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|the whole family enjoys angry birds and star wars. love the combo. a deefinate recommend for anyone who loves  angry birds
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I chose four stars because I dont remember being pulled back to the book on a daily basis.  I did, however, really enjoy the story.  I would have liked for the antagonists to have been explored just a little more.  I only met them near the end.  I would have liked more time and reasons to dislike them as a group.  Side note:  Many find my reviews lacking..  I refuse to give away the entire book.  The synopsis should do that for you.
B0047VSW30|4.0|Good story of pagans, Christians and Hypatia; a character of great dimension. Such a tragedy of the loss of the worlds treasures
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Read the other two books?  You have to read this one.  Didnt read the other two?  Dont read this one first.  This one tells Salander's entire story.  She has been captured and is awaiting trial as the story unfolds.  I enjoyed finally knowing the whole story and was mostly satisfied with the ending.  I will not give any details away.  I will say it was worth the time and money to find out how it all ends.  It saddens me that Mr Larsson did not get a chance to expand upon these characters more.  I loved how flawed yet strong they were.  The movie version of these books do not do the details justice.
B004EBZX6W|4.0|Pretty cool. Shows how strong the wi-fi is in a given area  even at home and it is easy to see.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Billy Connolly voices Fergus, her father and Emma Thompson is Elinor, her mother, the queen. These fine actors, great animation and an interesting story, you really can't miss with Brave.
B009AJD5E0|4.0|The movies starts slow, really slow... but it picks up nicely.  Have patience and sit back and enjoy.  It threw me a curve at the end, I always like being left to wonder.<br /><br />Nice movie for Sci-Fi watchers.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|This is easily the best book I've read in 2012. I'm not a chef - or a cook - and I was completely and totally entranced. The meta of the book is superb, and the meta of Tim discovering and then teaching how to be a chef, is unreal in its excellence. Simply - wow!
B008XNZMOU|5.0|I love tayor and she does not disappoint!!! This is the go-to cd in my car... Love love love!!! Go Red!!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|YouVersion's App offers an overwhelming amount of resources. From reading plans to audio Bible to multiple translations, it's one of my go-to mobile Bibles.
B009RI4ZKC|4.0|Almost surreal...children talking like perfect adults, adults accepting children's reality...funky little story with good actors.  Not as weird as Tim Burton, but almost!
B009NCM248|4.0|Production is amazing.  The songs are well crafted and executed.  The fact that Rachel Bolan from Skid Row played bass on it should be reason enough to buy it...
B0098460O4|5.0|This item is one of the best I have heard regarding opera and pop. The songs are beautiful.<br />I have recommended this item to my co-workers and friends and I know  they will love it .
B009HV2JT8|5.0|They obviuously did good research and blended the story flawlessly to historic events to make a very entertaining product. Well done.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I give this one 5 stars as it is so much fun. Very addictive in a good way. I would recommend this one to kids from 6-99 years of age.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Really fun and usually really fast to play.  A quick diversion during commercials or while riding in the car.  A few of the puzzles are really challenging and very satisfying to solve.
B005P39GOI|5.0|Ben Howard rocks I am in love with this album<br />If you love indie music you will love this<br />Also check out his new ep Burgh Island
B0085RQLXK|5.0|Love it!!! This is one of their best!  Well worth waiting for! The songs are amazing and the lyrics catchy as well!  Having Carrie Underwood on this CD is an added bonus.  She and Steven Tyler sound amazing together.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Great game.. hours and hours of fun and best of all its free!!! Really enjoy it and would definitely recommend it.
B007T99ENE|4.0|Not his best, but nonetheless  excellent writing.  A clever story, well constructed and intriguing enough to keep one going through to the end.<br /><br />For Ian McEwan fans.
B0019T9FL6|4.0|Jennifer Hudson has a powerful voice and the words just seem so real, if you truly know what I mean.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|This is an amazing series. I would never have guessed that a series about zombies would be so successful, but you must see this show.
B0028K3192|5.0|Pretty Wings is soo beautiful! It makes you say aaahhh! It puts me in a very tranquil mood, sexy too!
B004XKMZVK|5.0|Their second but best album for me.<br /><br />Six great songs on this one; fewest dudes.  Buy first and Heartbreak station next.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Best show ever!! I would watch it over and over. I'm hooked every second. Will buy the whole season. Perfect.
B0055PGUYU|4.0|Provides insight into understanding our habits (bad and good) with supporting examples.  You will find yourself scrutinizing your own behavior.
B001KRVLCI|1.0|Thankfully I only paid 1.99 for this DVD. It would not play the movie only the commentary from director & writers. Very frustrating!
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Very good movie for adults and kids. Lots of action and drama, the queen was great. Good with pizza and coke
B0094BB4TW|1.0|this is a terrible app. doesnt load more as scrolling down. needs much improvement.if there was a diff app i wwould get that one
0547848412|5.0|I am a member of three book clubs and so I read roughly 900 pages a month, and \\"Life of Pi\\" is one of the BEST books I've read in quite some time!  I was hooked just by reading the \\"Author's Note\\" and couldn't wait to delve into the book.  Once I started reading it,  I didn't want the story to end!  I can't wait to see the movie tomorrow with my book club and to discuss them both afterwards!  I highly recommend this story and I can't wait to make someone's day by giving them my copy to enjoy.
B008TMA1LY|2.0|I used to buy points once in a while...had no problems, bought some last week, they never showed on the game. I've not been able to make it work, so after 5 refunds....I give up. uninstall.
B009NPKTN6|4.0|story was lame but the music was a great blast from the past and cruise was great in his role
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Great book starting the next one today. Love the mixture of fantasy and royalty with some mid evil mixed in.
B008FC4WA4|3.0|I love Nick Hornby but this short story of his is just... Harmless. It didn't do me any good or any harm to read it, it just felt bland. Nothing like everything else that he writes, that usually cracks me up. It's ery short too (obviously, being a short story), so it's not like it was time wasted away or anything.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Seriously I can't put it down, on the computer on my phone all of the time. I had to literally pull myself away from it. The App or website loses connection to the server often which is annoying because it doesn't put you back where you were.
B001AQO3QA|4.0|The movies arent a scary as I remember when I first saw them but the picture quality on blu-ray is excellent. Havent watched the extras yet...
B009NTNHJU|5.0|I love this woman! She is so talented. She can do pop, rap, and r&b. Her vocals are good too! If you see the DVD, she shows off her vocals & they sound beautiful! I love this album! It's everything I asked for (:
B007XNAQLA|5.0|this is some of the best live recorded music i've ever heard (and i don't like live music either!)  i just can't get enough of listening to this 2 cd set.  the music is fantastic.  get a nice bottle of wine, pour a big glass, put these disc's on and sit back and enjoy!
B005LAIHPE|5.0|I don't care what the critics say. This movie is good! I would recommend this movie to anyone to see.
B001GJ9G90|4.0|This movie has historical interest, as it was the stated vehicle for the real-life union of Pitt and Jolie.  the characters themselves are simple one-dimensional characters, yet they are highly skilled assassins, which makes for a good shoot-em-up movie.<br /><br />Additionally, the Smiths find a love for each other that they depend on to enter a test of skill that is a bonnie and clyde stand-off with a group of shadowy killers.  The ambush scene is touching in a way, but never stops being violent.  the violence in the movie is a metaphor for the threat of domestic violence that shadows all normal marriages. And, as in life, working out problems and tensions that could lead to unhappy and unsafe marriages, the proof of the hard work that makes a good marriage is the unbreakable resultant genuine marital fidelity of each partner, here symbolized by *Mr. and Mrs. Smith* as survival against all odds.
B005P68PSI|5.0|Okay, I fell in love with this series at the begining of Summer 2012 and dedicated many hours to catching up before the next season began.  I love the story, the gory bits, the funny bits, the sexy bits! All of it.
B008PNBU30|5.0|Three Days Grace is one of the most amazing bands ever. I've been a fan since their debut, and every three years, I've been ever-so-eager for their album and never have I been let down. Transit of Venus offers a slightly different sound than what is previously heard from TDG (then again, every album has some new sound they offer). Everything that TDG promises about this album, they meet up every expectation. I wrote a heartfelt review about their song, Chalk Outline, before I was able to purchase the album. Everything I said there applies to the whole album because now that I've heard all their songs on Transit of Venus, I can't listen to this album without hitting the repeat button first. If you love Three Days Grace and love their music, GET THE ALBUM!! ;)<br /><br />(referenced : [[ASIN:B008UURKTG Chalk Outline]] )
B000VMFDW2|4.0|Makes you understand why they consider them the best generation. Impossible conditions, lousy food and an inplacable enemy yet they still perservered.
B008JH5CVS|3.0|Probably good for a stay at home on a cold winter night movie, acting was good, plot could have used a little bit more work as well as some of the characters. Lots of action, usual guy rescues gal from evil convicts stuff. All and all just a fun to watch sci-fi.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|Great cd. It includes some great tracks you can added to your workout mix or for those long car rides
B0047SF41G|4.0|I have been hooked into the Predator movies and the Alien ones from the beginning, the books too. There was only one that I didn't think was worth my watching, this was not it. It had good acting, I admit they picked a similar jungle scenaro to the first Predator movie just moved it to a different planet, but it had the same action, good creatures effects. It held my attention throughout the whole movie and I will be adding it to my Predator & Alien movie collection.
B0092SPYQG|5.0|Definitely one of their greatest albums. One of the only bands that has not yet disappointed me. Will always eat their music
B006LSZECO|3.0|I am only partially through this book.  I don't get the long time on the best seller list.  I think if you are getting ready to leave your husband or murder your wife it might be for you.  Who knows.  I may, if I continue reading.
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|Very sweet story with a heart-warming message.  I highly recommend it! Great for both adults and kids. Picture quality was good via amazon streaming.
B007SGM084|5.0|Not my usual style of books but, everyone around me was talking about it. So, I had to find out what all the fuss was about. Storyline was great and a little heart wrenching.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|Had this movie and someone borrowed it and did not return it.  Had to have it for this Christmas to watch with my grandson.
B00A0HQ7H8|4.0|I LOVE Lana Del Rey. That being said, Paradise is not a stand-alone album. It deals with a lot of the same subject matter, rhythms, melodies, and even lyrics from Born to Die.<br />I was expecting something totally new from Lana but it seems like an extension of the motifs heard in Born to Die.<br />All the same, I recommend the album for certain songs like Ride, Cola, the cover of Blue Velvet, and Gods & Monsters.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Imagine spending several hours with two unlikable people with very few if any redeeming qualities--it's in this book. Add to this every stereotype you have ever heard about New Yorkers versus those bumpkins that live in the Mid West--it's in this book.  Toss in a whole lot of misogynistic ramblings with every female pretty much being a psycho, controlling bitch and the men helpless momma's boy patsies--it's in this book. Play out every cliche about bumbling incompetent cops and the brilliant, non mistake making criminal--it's in this book. And have it all culminate in one of the worse most unsatisfying endings--it's in this book.  If that's your idea of a good time, then maybe you'd love this book.  While this is not the worse thing I've read, it certainly felt like a complete waste of time by the time I got to the end.
B007THA4FI|4.0|Put aside any thoughts on Harry Potter. she still has the attention to detail on characters. very good book but takes awhile to build all the characters and then it is over.
B007EECSFA|4.0|Enjoyed the book!  I liked how the chapters moved between the two main characters and the respective time zones. Recommend
B00335EQ0E|5.0|My grandchildren never tire of this one. I think it is the best version of Alice in Wonderland. A timeless classic!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Oh I am obsessed with this tv series and I was extremely excited to find out I can watch episodes on amazon. I love that there is no commercials, and it is affordable. Thanks so much, and I get to watch it over again.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I loved this game so much that even when I get to a certain level and it would freeze and not let me into the store I would just delete it and re download starting all over again. I did this like 5 times and now its gone. very upset. Id buy it if it worked. please bring this game back!
B000GT7XXW|4.0|Love the movie, I don't care if it is four hours long. Plus it's a bonus having it on my amazon account, I can watch it any where.
B009ERK1T0|5.0|Believe the hype! Brilliant from beginning to end! Deftones are masters of mixing volatile agression with dreamlike, spacey ambience. It's deliciously addicting! If you're a fan buy it. It will blow your mind!
B009NQKPUW|5.0|Prometheus was such a beautiful film so much work was put into this and it shows. Very little CG all location shots, prosthetics and make up was amazing all the monsters and creatures were old school robotics and puppet work very well done. The sets were all built. It's a very refreshing sci fi film, and the characters in the movie are awesome top notch acting the musical scores were beautiful. Should I go on? Lol I highly recommend this movie. I have to say I really loved the Avengers a lot but Prometheus wins the best movie of the year in my book.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|This is by far the best sound of the Beatles,compared with vinyl lp box and stereo cds. All disc in this box contain the original art and are made in Japan.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|I just love to watch a fun movie just to be entertained. It is good to see the aging actors having fun
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Ahhh, I can't wait for the next book! These characters are so complicated and semi-toxic for each other, but I love the drama, lol. The next book needs to come out sooner!
B009GEFXLC|5.0|It is great to be able to stream on amazon prime. The show is so cute and sometimes it makes you think real hard
B000ME5B30|5.0|A superb movie with much to absorb...stimulating and alarming at the same time...more meaningful now having<br />lived through Hurricane Sandy.
159420411X|5.0|The book gave a very logical and detailed description of how Nate Silver developed and optimized his methodology for making mathematical predictions.  He did this in several venues: baseball, weather basketball and politics.
B008O9V4C2|5.0|Mr. Fagen does it again, this is yet another proof of his genius, it is really hard for me to express the overwhelmingly joy I felt when I heard these new tracks, I had been a fan since \\"Do it again\\" came on the radio, and never look back, I actually had every single LP that came out at the time and  left them behind once I came to America, now I have all his collection + Steely Dan's collection on CD format.<br />This new album just enhance that collection, I hope Mr. Fagen just keeps on going, his music feels just like a fine wine, getting even better with time.<br />I really love, respect and appreciate his music.<br /><br />Armando Romero<br />Fresno CA
B004Z8ZFAI|5.0|I ordered the movie for my grandson, because he likes movies with music. He stood up & danced everytime music played during the entire movie, I think we hav a new favorite :-)
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Hilarious for kids and adults, full of gags and action. Our whole family sat and watched, we play it a few times a year, very recommended...buy it!
0547995660|5.0|I have read this book in a hard copy. It is good both for adults and children, for it has got some implied and hidden messages that sound quite real today as well. The imaginary community there appears very convincing with its symptomatic developments of technology and human nature. Although this book touches on some serious social issues, it delivers its storyline in an intriguing and lighthearted, even amusing way. The style is quite \\"reader-friendly\\", enjoyable and immersive. I also recommend it to language students.
0679411585|5.0|The greatest book I've ever bought. Very poetic in more than one way it gives the men and women who have, do and will serve ever lasting life to their sacrifices.
030758836X|5.0|Now I know what they mean by a real page turner. Could not wait to find out how it ends.
B00AA7O6QC|1.0|I feel sad for all the hungry people in the world that could have been fed with the money they wasted on creating this disaster of a movie. Its pathetic and lame. The cheesiness is limburger gone very, very bad. Even more sad, is that I wasted my own money renting it.
0694003611|5.0|Great book.  I remember my parents reading this book to me and now I love reading it to my child.  It has a great natural rhythm that makes my son sleepy.  Definately recommend.
B003V5CFV8|5.0|Great movie, incredible music. I've watched this movie a number of times, and thoroughly enjoyed it every time. Not quite appropriate for all ages; there's some violence and a pretty suggestive scene.
0062082353|1.0|This product arrived severely damaged. The pages were unevenly cut and very jagged. I decided to return it for a full refund and after my husband read the reviews (it was a gift) he was happy that I did.
B0020M99LC|5.0|To paraphrase Lee Ermey, Bond is born again hard in Daniel Craig with a healthy dose of gritty modern day angst grafted onto the original Sean Connery prototype. Once in a great while they get it right and this is that time.
1603427244|5.0|I have already used this book a couple of times.  It is well illustrated--written for knitters by a knitter.  Recommend it highly.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I'm a fan of facebook for about 4 years. i enjoy keeping in touch with family, friends and new friends!
B001706I5I|5.0|Great movie to kick of the Christmas season. My son is almost 4 and was enthralled to watch and learn all about the Grinch. We will be watching it every year..maybe more than once!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|What is the weather like where I live? how is the fishing for the day? what's brewing in the Atlantic? The weather channel, of course!
B004XJRQUQ|2.0|Book 1 awesome and that's where it should have stopped. 2 and 3 I felt the author was just grasping.
1476712042|5.0|When my friend suggested this book I thought what the heck I need something to read during my holiday break, So I downloaded it on my kindle I read the whole thing in less than 2 days and was subjected to every emotion humanly possible.I truly could not put it down until I was finished reading then immeadiately looked to see when the 2nd part of the story was going to be released having to wait until April for walking disaster is going seem like forever .
B0070Y46UY|2.0|This was a really a pedantic book...too much philosophy and really tedious...with all its make believe detail...ugh<br />I would not recommend this book<br />it was written as non-fiction, but was bad fiction on and on and on
B001V58BUY|4.0|Great movie and story for sharing with children. We were fondly surprised as we were looking for the cartoon version.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|It seems that people either like Angry Birds or they hate it with a passion. Well I like Angry Birds and this one is no exception. They took the normal Angry Birds formula, knock down structures and kill potties, but added some space levels and gave the birds different abilities. It follows the Star Wars story and as you meet different characters you get to use them. Obi Wan can force push blocks, Han has a blaster and Luke can swing his lightsaber while flying through the air. These additions make the game really fun to play. I can't wait for the next episode to be released.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|My son, my husband and I all enjoy this movie. The graphics are well done, it's very colorful and just fun.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. As a Disney/Pixar, it was very well put together. Brave is a tale of magic and parenting, understanding and change.
B009YU6FJM|5.0|The Deftones latest has once again proved them to be re inventors of their genre. It finds away to be melodic and beautiful without losing too much of their edge from the mid 90's. While it isn't as hard as their earliest efforts it rocks and elicits an emotional response every time I listen. I am fairly certain Chino is in love. Get this album.
B00AA7O6QC|4.0|While no academy awards will be given, it is full of action, humor, and camaraderie.  I hope they do more of them.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Very fun and addictive. Becomes more complex with each level. Use your logic to connect the dots but don't over think it.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|I loved it! I loved the sweet Scotland brogue. I loved the contemporary theme: that things never change . . wise and well-meaning parents still loving and wanting the best for their kids, young people still wanting independence, and at the same time, still wanting to be a 'kid' in their hearts––both with things to yet learn.  And a happy ending!! Perfect!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Very exciting season!  We love all of the action so far and can't wait to see what will happen next!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I have read a lot of psychological thrillers but this one takes the cake.  Amy Dunne takes it to a new level! I had never read a book by Gillian Flynn, and  I am looking forward to reading some of her other books.
B009LK6JS2|2.0|Could not figure out t<br />he nuances of this game, oh well. Graphics are. e good but without directions I don't have a clue about it
B00979CS50|5.0|I am an avid fan of Neil Young. This CD with Crazy Horse takes me back to my younger days (the BEST for music and good times) in the late 60s, early 70s. Every song is a pleasure to listen to. Long overdue but worth the wait. Great thanks to these musicians for sharing their talents with us. I will never tire of listening to and thoroughly enjoying  every minute of every song.
B001H1UQRI|5.0|One of my all time favorites. Really awesome that I can watch it whenever I want now. First rule is....
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|I really enjoyed this episode. I missed it on it's original FX TV air date so was happy to be able to get it through Amazon.
B002V0GZ9M|5.0|This movie is has a mystical side which is intriguing. The story  line moves quickly and covers many aspects of relationships in a very short period of time. This is a feel good chick flick.
B006OAB3ME|3.0|WHAT A GREAT Man this guy is a 70 he still working on new music that well always be around. . IN THE EARLY 60s I<br />WAS IN A SCHOOL LIKE YOU READ ABOUT IN&#34; CATCHER IN THE RYE&#34; .THE OLD PREP PROGRAM AN WHEN THE<br />FOUR BOYS CAME HEAR FROM ENGLAND THEY CHANGE ROCK FOREVER AN EVERYONE COULD ENJOY THER<br />WELL WRITTEN SONGS . A RATING FOR A,FOR  AAA  RATED PERSON  THAT I ENJOY 65YRS LATER.
B008FRFN7A|3.0|Haven't been able to figure out setup just yet.  I bought another product and it pretty much set itself and worked instantly so this one is sitting on the tablet unused.
B004AQR29C|3.0|No story here, don't look for one or expect it. But lots of things blow up, and lots of big stars are the source of those explosions. Based on my mood at the time, it made it enjoyable.
0307279189|5.0|This book is fascinating. Fast paced and soooo interesting. You don't have to be a runner to enjoy it. I wish I was young enough to start running.
B005GFPZYK|3.0|Found it to be a little sloppy and the timeline wasn't very consistent.I'm sure ghost writers would have been used so it should have been a lot better.It's an interesting story just not very well executed.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Although I did not know what this book was all about and hearing that it was a good read from some of my friends, I ordered it for my Kindle.  Boy was I surprised at what arrived.  I have read books that contained sex before (quite a few) but they at least had a story within them.  I found this book to be nothing but sex and kinky sex with a very weak story line, if you want to call it that.  I was not impressed.  I will not be buying the second or third installment.
B007V65R54|5.0|I expected this to be a book about predicting political elections and polling, an interesting enough topic in itself.  I was pleasantly surprised to find a wide range of examples of the art and science of prediction ranging from politics, earthquakes, economics, global warming, and terrorism.<br /><br />While the math is very accessible to anyone with a high school education, there are enough specifics to allow you to apply Bayesian logic to solving prediction problems in your own life.
B0058W74UY|2.0|Haven't been able to use yet.. It has never fully loaded... Just sits there 3/4 loaded. What am I supposed to do with it?
B004P4S4NM|5.0|My girls all talked about her, you hear her on the radio but I didn't really know much about her music until the latest Bond movie.  So I checked out Amazon and was quite amazed but her voice, her music and the stories in the music.  For such a young star she has a bright, bright future and I am looking forward to her next CD already.
B007MC8YLQ|4.0|Great game  for my Kindle as I have been addicted to Freecell on my PC for years now. Real handy to take along.
B009YU62H2|5.0|As a long time SG fan, this album delivers complex songs that really grow on you over time.  Welcome back guys.  Can’t wait to see the band live again in Oakland in Feb 2013.
B008BQ8YHQ|4.0|I was able to watch the series on my Kindle Fire during my flight.  Great video.  Great story line. Believable?
B009FB3XTA|4.0|I've got all of the Twilight movie music collected and believe this one to be a pretty good offering. The songs aren't as &#34;loud&#34; as some have been in the past and generally have a pleasant listening factor to them. I didn't, however, like as many selections as I have in the past, my greatest preference being for #1 &#34; Where I come from&#34; by Passion Pit and #8 &#34;Heart of Stone&#34; by someone called Iko.<br />Nikki Reed and her husband Paul McDonald sing a duet on # 11 &#34;All I've ever needed&#34;, I've seen the video on the movie website and got the impression that I'd rather hear her (cant hear her well here).<br />I liked Christina Perri's  &#34;A Thousand Years&#34; on the part 1 soundtrack, her new version here is over elaborate, not as good.<br />Carter Burwell has a selection too,  # 14  &#34;Plus Que Ma Propre Vie&#34;, lots of familiar bits in that one- a lot of his tunes are that way. I hope his score for this movie isn't all &#34;sound alike&#34;.<br /><br />Worth getting if you like the movie.
B005DOJ68K|5.0|If you grew up with the sounds of Creedence Clearwater, you'll savor this album of greatest hits. Well worth its $5 price tag.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Really? No Share option??? Disappointing app for Kindle with very basic functionality. I expected something better than this, but no such luck.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Enjoyable and fun game.  So far, after 50 or so puzzles, I have found it pretty easy.  Hope it gets harder.
0525953590|5.0|Particle at the End of the Universe: How the Hunt for the Higgs Boson Leads Us To The Edge of a New World  by Sean Carroll is an excellent book about the nature of newly found particles like the Higgs Boson particle which is responsible for mass.<br /><br />Carroll describes the Higgs Boson particle as a vibration around a steady value everywhere throughout the universe rather than a vibration around zero. The Higgs Boson particle has the potential to release energy like a ball rolling down a hill. Once fields are pushed from the preferred state, they are given potential energy.<br /><br />Left on their own, Higgs Boson particles vibrate and dissipate energy by transferring it to other fields according to the author. The strength of weak interactions is 246 GeV; whereas, the Higgs Boson field sits at the lowest energy state on the bottom of a pendulum arc.<br /><br />The author suggests creating Higgs Boson particles by detecting particles they decay into from a steady state. The objective of modern science is to prove where the Higgs Boson particles originate. Without Higgs Boson, scientists could not fathom how elementary particles have mass at all.<br /><br />To date, scientists have found combinations of quarks and gluons that smash together to form the Higgs Boson particle. Once Higgs Bosson is created, the particle gives mass to other particles which created it. The author explains that the Higgs Boson particles are created at high energies. Space and time are known to change at high velocities according to the theory of relativity. Time slows down and lengths contract along the direction of motion.<br /><br />Carroll shows how Dr. Richard Feynman described bosons geometrically. Forces carrying bosons are depicted with wavy lines. Fermions are depicted with solid lines and the Higgs Boson particle is shown with a dash. The Feynman geometry<br />of bosons looks a bit like the characters in Morse Code.<br /><br />Dr. Feynman showed diagrammatically how multiple gluons feed into a quark with a Higgs Boson as an output. Higgs Boson particles travel less than a billionth of an inch between their origination and decay. The process of proving how they exist and disintegrate is a continuing challenge for scientists which is limited by the fact that matter can neither be created nor destroyed.<br /><br />Particle at the End of the Universe is an important scientific work which explains current research findings on the Higgs Boson particle, as well as the scientific challenges inherent in proving the existence of the particle and the decay mechanism.<br /><br />Credits: First Published by Blogcriticsgluons feed into a quark with a Higgs Boson as an output.

B009NOVCTM|4.0|I gave this as a gift. I heard some of it. I would have thought there was more songs I didn't know. Not the case. But good anyway.
B008NR90HQ|5.0|This is a must have show for any Gary Moore fan . He does a superb job on some HOT Hendrix tunes . The real deal comes when Mitch Mitchell and Billy Cox come out for 3 songs .W O W you won't be dissapointed .:-)
B009RI4FRU|1.0|I would not recommend this movie to anyone,did not like the movie and consider very bad enterainment,if I could give it 0in stars I would
B006OOHYIC|5.0|more fun than a barrel of very thoughtful monkeys. keeps you sucked in and trying.  i hope more levels are coming!
B0085Z8F4A|1.0|Ok i like aliens and sci fi movies but this didn't make any sense.  I was like huh what. This is just crap. Story was confusing and just left me confused.  On the positive side the sound and effects were awesome and I got this on black friday for 10 bucks. Ok where is the sequel to District 9. Now that is a good sci-fi alien movie.
B009IKPOUO|5.0|Another reason to love Barbra! This compelation of music is exciting to listen to. Come on...its Barbra....its gotta be good! Add this to your collection..you wont be dissappointed!
B0060D2QR6|3.0|The book was quite a bit better than the movie.  The movie left out parts that made this book my favorite Nicholas Sparks book so far.  I probably would have enjoyed the movie more if I did not know how much was missing.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|Great series. Bought this season because it wasn't yet available to stream from Netflix. It did not disappoint. Cannot wait for season 6.  This is one of the better series on television.  None of the characters are necessarily &#34;good&#34; people, but their story is entertaining.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|my kiddos love this game!  even my 3 y/o loves to play this game.  would definately recommend this game to all
B004GJDQT8|4.0|I have not used this app a lot, but is has made it easier to use my phone for Amazon purchases than going through the web.
B0072X2O66|3.0|Given the presence of both Portnoy and Allen, I was expecting a less mainstream and a more polished sound. The music is all fine, but I'm used to Russell Allen putting more effort into his vocal performances. Mike Orlando brings a great energy to the guitar and John Moyer does not dissappoint on bass duties. In some songs, Portnoy seems comfortable, but on some I can only imagine he's bored as this sound doesn't compare to what he's best known for. Once I get past that it's not a bad album, but I think it leaves something to be desired when compared with many other entries in mainstream rock. Not a bad album but it didn't become a fixture in my CD player.
B006ZS7ZLS|5.0|I love this album from start to finish! I was surprised because I typically do not like this genre of music, but she pulls it off well.
1402712367|5.0|This is a wonderful story. I got this for a Christmad gift fir my Great Granddaughter.  I'm hoping she'll love it as much as I did.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|Classic Science Fiction themed story of discovery and mystery that should have been a little more forthcoming with it's intentions as these mysteries were unveiled. I know Damon Lindelof is the go-to guy for unanswered questions in a story, but just too much was left hanging in the wind.  Even with these flaws the film is dazzling in it's presentation and it's scares.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|This is the first headset I've ever owned and I have to say that... I just adore it. The sounds are great, the mic is wonderful when I talk to other team players or friends on TeamSpeak. It's just wonderful. Recommended for first timers too!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|While most of the good authors remain pretty much in the same genre and at the same literary level over time, Ken Follett is a rare one.  He continues to expand his scope and to mature as an author.  In Winter of the World, he crosses the line from entertainment to literature.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Lee Child never fails to cook up a delicious feast for me. I'm pacing the floor until the next Reacher novel.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this is a really great app. it's challenging, fun, and completely addictive.  it makes me think and it is really interesting!
B000JMKTLO|1.0|Yikes, I have to say the story made my teeth hurt...the pain inflicted upon my upper and lower molars forced me to shout obscenities at my Kindle. Thank goodness Ms. Flynn learned to write by the time she got to Girl Gone or Gone Girl. I cannot believe the two books were written by the same author.
B0090EKRKU|5.0|My 11 year old grandson and I watched this movie together. He is adamant lately about not watching &#34;baby&#34; movies but he agreed to watch it with me and we BOTH enjoyed it soo much!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I played for about two weeks and slowly got bored because I was just dropping coins all over the place and it got super easy after getting x amount of coins. Fun.... for two weeks
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|It's going to be a classic...heart warming and true.<br />I definitely recommend this movie for the whole family<br />A definite buy
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game is super fun and almost impossible to stop playing... so in case you don't want to be addicted, don't play this.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|This is an all time favorite movie of the super heros<br />I will see parts 2, 3, 4 however many!!!
B009HV2JT8|5.0|If you like action & vampires, you should watch it! It's action packed & funny. It even acquires facts about Abraham Lincoln
B0043ZDFEQ|5.0|Hooked on Bruno Mars, every song on this album is excellent listening! Can't wait for the next album, buy it now
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|An excellent show of humor, intelligence, and brute strength blended seamlessly for a display of superhuman teamwork. Well done! A+A+A+!!!
B004NOH9LC|5.0|Wanted something to watch that was lighthearted, interesting and fast paced.  This movie had just the right ingredients to meet everyone of the the 3 requirements.  I liked that the leading role was a driven woman.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It is a really great calculator! it can be used anywhere and anytime ( saying if u had battery ) and is actually sumwhat better than regulat calculators...
B000SEGUDE|1.0|I have read a few really bad books in my day and this one is one of the worst. The author writes like Herman Melville with a very bad case of ADD.  I knew about the multiple stories and the time periods covered prior to starting the book and I expected it to be a difficult just because of this ambitious goal. What I did not expect was the multiple thoughts and vectors the author would take in the same paragraph throughout the book. It was extremely difficult to follow mainly because the book is written so poorly. It wasn't a bad story and it seems that the author had great intentions with the story line, but the writing style is so bad that it completely detracts from the story and makes the book impossible to enjoy.  There is a lot of detail and a great deal of description, but in far too many paragraphs throughout the book, the author goes from one thought to another, one time period to another, one character to another and these numerous vectors within the same paragraph are extremely hard to follow. Especially when the author makes no attempt to tie his thoughts together in the ensuing paragraphs.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|Thus is a game my son plays,allot. He  likes it very much. He told me he would tell a friend to get it.
B009SQR28A|5.0|This is such a great movie! Our entire family loves it. The characters are funny and charming. A definate must see!
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|My son likes it. He plays it and he likes it. He says he would tell a friend to get it.
B004MC8CA2|1.0|This was not what I had expected. For me this app  was hard to follow at times I did not care for that
B002ZBN13A|5.0|Great Music. It seems like every time I purchase the actual physical CD it gets destroyed. Now I have it in digital form!
B005LAIH4A|1.0|My kids might give this 2 stars, but as an adult that relished the older TV version, this simply stinks.  We purchased it because we thought we read somewhere it was made by the same people who did Despicable Me (which we love).  Unfortunately it is nothing like the old TV version or similar in style to Despicable Me.<br /><br />If you must try it rent it first and save your money.
B004F5GLJ0|1.0|Weak unbelievable acting by the entire cast, especially Stewart.  It was difficult to sit in same room with this playing.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|fun and addicting game once you get it downloaded. could certainly do without  the ads tho. hours and hours of fun.
B00A12VW86|1.0|All songs sound the same boring<br />And old idk what happened 2 greenday they lost what they had<br />greenday is dead
B00144VBBS|5.0|I don't know which of the 2 CDs in this set is my favorite.  Both are excellent.  Arrived in perfect condition in record time (pun intended).  Keep in the car and sing along wherever I travel.
B005QPMB2Y|4.0|I downloaded the full version of IP Cam Viewer to have portable access to cameras we have at different locations. I give it 4 stars because it is a great app for its tasks. The features are on key for viewing ip cameras and it works great viewing non-ip cameras which are connected to a dvr having networking capabilities. The 5th star will be given when there is an inclusion to control a dvr remotely as well allowing playback of previously recorded video on my android device.<br />I would recommend ip cam viewer to anyone who wants to view cameras on their phone or tablet.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Great fun, enjoy the music and videos. I dont have 13 more words to type so I will waste storage space.
0439023491|5.0|I already reviewed this, why is it popping up for reviw again? It was a good book, but doesn't need more reviews from me.
B009YU62H2|3.0|As a teenager i was a number 1 level sound garden fan,  absolutely loved them and played their CDs non-stop, the rhythm, base, Cornell's voice, everything was a great stress relief for me as a youth. When hey broke up in 1997 I was distraught, but was still thankful for all the awesome music.<br /><br />Fast forward to now since 2010 I have been waiting for this album with high expectations and have to say that this is not the sound garden of old, the lost the grunge hard rock feel, the musical tone is there but the music lacks, the depth and soul of their previous efforts. I find that Chris Cornell and his voice do not sound as strong at lower volume with so many layers of looping vocals to make sound as powerful as he once was.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong I still love this band but their days of real kick ass hard rock are over.  Lets hope they remember who they are for the next album.
B005K17RU0|3.0|My wife uses it on her kindle, but not very often.  She prefers the same product on her Windows 7.5 phone as she always has her phone with her, but does not always have the Kindle with her.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|It is very useful. Only problem it can randomly pop up and make you quit your game or whatever youaredoing.
B00632HWOG|5.0|It works.  I use it on my computer, my Windows 7.5 phone and my wife's Windows 7.5 phone and her Kindle.
0340827246|4.0|This cookbook is hard to put down.You get immersed in the recipes and the stories.It's hard to pick which recipe to try first.
0439023513|4.0|It is a good book and as the associated movie is not yet released, I cannot state that it matches the movie, but my guess is that it will.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I didn't think that I would like watching tv shows and movies on my computer, but Amazon makes it easy.  The clarity of picture and the speed of download are both incredible.  I truly enjoy this tv series and I cannot get enough of it.  Jonny Lee Miller and Lucy Liu are fantastic and the stories keep you intrigued.  I throughly recommend this show.
0316228532|5.0|This is a good drama story set in a provincial burg in the UK.  It's probably a four star book but I gave it five to offset the critics that didn't read it and rated it low or commented that it wasn't HP/Fantasy/Children's book or were expecting something else and were therefore disappointed.  Love JK's style and the Kindle version was well edited.  JK enjoys writing with a large cast of characters and it was nice to have the Kindle version to so I could keep up with the characters.  I bought this for my Christmas Book Club book exchange.
B005K4H7NE|5.0|Queen kept getting better and better as the years went on.  They were never shy to try new approaches to music or different styles.  This is cd with Bicylce race and Fat Bottomed Girls on it.  I love this cd from the first song to it's last and this has five additional tracks on it including acoustic and instrumental versions.
B009X011UQ|4.0|The purple on the site is a very nice, rich purple, and in person the case is a paler, lighter purple.  It has a bit more silver in it and frankly, looks metallic rather than plastic. The back is a hard shell-like plastic with a slot in the middle and the front is a flat black flap with the Marware name and logo.  The Kindle snaps into the shell which is a hair taller than the device.  When the flap is closed, the case is only the slightest bit bigger than the actual Kindle.  The plastic is has a brushed feel and feels sturdy without the I'm-gonna-drop-it feeling that some plastic cases give you.<br /><br />Unlike on the Vibe, the strap on the MicroShell is wide and seems to belong--its not as jarring, probalby because the flap is black.  The strap is also wider and because of the thinnest of the cover the elastic strap is needed to hold the case closed.<br /><br />To use as a stand, the flap is folded back and lodges in a slot on the back of the case. It sounds flimsy, looks like it may be flimsy, but I stopped trying to break it because it was obvious that I would break it trying to prove any flimsyness.  You won't have to worry about it falling over unless you don't get the back of the flap into the slot. I'm not sure if this will get irritating or not since I keep doing it with the back of the device facing away from me before remembering to turn it around.  The back of the case has speaker 'grills' directly over the Kindle speakers, but I didn't test the sound with this case. (I'm at work)<br /><br />The shell is snug enough that your device won't fall out by accident, IMO, they should have covered more of the sides of the device, leaving the cutouts only for the volume/power buttons.  To be fair, this is clearly shown in the images on the Amazon site if you know what you're looking at.  Like the Vibe, only the outside corners of the Kindle are covered, leaving the entire bezel free to show off your favorite skin.<br /><br />The Microshell case is well made and light enough for easy portability.  I am probably biased towards low profile cases, but I totally see why it is $10 more than the Vibe case.  I'll definitely be keeping this one and only see replacing it if I find a low profile leather case.<br /><br />Grade: Blight enough for easy portability.  I am probably biased towards low profile cases, but I totally see why it is $10 more than the Vibe case.  I'll definitely be keeping this one and only see replacing it if I find a low profile leather case.<br /><br />Grade: B
B002RXVOX0|5.0|really good yhrill as well as a love story<br />finally a dracula movie that is scarry and enticing<br />Dracula with longella
B005P59ANS|4.0|easy to use and i love the slim fit. the speakers are covered so your sounds dont come out as loud and some conversations sound a littled muffled.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love the show very interesting can't wait to see the rest of the season great purchase thank you. Lenny Whyles
B00A6N7BS0|4.0|The film was all I expected and more, However, it stopped twice  for a few minutes to download during watching.
B008458O3S|4.0|After I solve one puzzle, I am curious about the next one and have to play it. It is very addictive.
B009HQ9UHC|1.0|You can barely play this before you have to sign up or pay for a download! I think it stinks.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|Completely different from Angry Birds still challenging and fun.<br />Lots of options and combination of elements to achieve the goals on each level.  Challenges grow in complexity with game levels.<br />Another great game from Rovio.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This is a rare book that stands in the very rarefied top stratum of my&#34; best books ever&#34;. It's one of the few books that makes the tears flow and causes you to laugh out loud all on the same page and not necessarily because the subject matter is emotional, but because of King's intuitive connection on a deep level with the subject matter. My last sitting was over 14 hours and i was completely unaware of the passage of time<br /><br />This is one for the ages.<br /><br />BTW:I read this on my Kindle which I suspect was easier than holding up a 1000 page hardcover for hours at a time
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This is on my daughters table.  She uses it all of the time.  It is one she uses every day
B00519YPUQ|1.0|Of course the movie is AWESOME but Amazon HD kept crashing.  Eventually I gave up and re-rented it in non-HD which worked better.
B0058VW36U|5.0|my kids love this game.  It keeps them entertained while on car trips and other times as well. it is a great choice
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Admittedly, I downloaded this game to get the points from glu, for another game. You have to okay the game you download to get your points.....well played Glu!  I thought it would be nothing I wanted,  and boy was I wrong!  I love this game, and will play for hours if geiven the chance.(not that it happens...lol) Really entertaining and fun.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Totally enjoy this game! It's challenging but super fun at the same time. You will not be sorry, its a great mind exerciser.
1577311523|5.0|I've bought several copies of this book for friends and family members, just because I loved it so much! It will change how you see life!
B009E3EY4M|5.0|This special event of the Reunion of one of the most popular rock band in the world is finally release after been released in a bootleg version. This time, it's a professionally video with a nice picture and sound quality. It's a great pleasure to see the unique guitar playing style of Jimmy Page who is the member that made the Led Zeppelin sound what it is, with of course the recognizable voice of Robert Plant. Only missing the drummer John Bonham who is replace by his son Jason, who played a very tight performance on this show with a solid and precise style of drumming.<br /><br />The editing of camera shots are nice, but i was annoyed by the mix of professionally shots with some audience camera shots. Maybe it gives another perspective on the guys, but a poor quality picture on a Blu-Ray looks rather ugly. The first part of the show present for the first time live the song \\"For Your Life\\", from the album Presence. And it's with this song that the crew starts to create special effects on the screen behind the stage. The band played the beautiful \\"Trampled Under Foot\\" with the \\"Ray Manzarek\\" keyboards passage that i have always enjoyed. Then the band played the very atmospheric \\"No Quarter\\" with again plenty of keyboards by John Paul Jones. And then the second part, the big classic songs are played ; \\"Kashmir\\", Stairway to Heaven\\", \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" etc.<br /><br />All in all the performance of the songs seems to be close to the originals, it's a pleasure to see the band with the latest technology. The visuals are secondary to the music with Led Zeppelin but the way they use the light show was symbolic to me because it feels like a sunny day or the presence of the fire throughout the set.<br /><br />A classic performance by the best classic rock band, i could not give another rating then a 5!
B002M87V0A|5.0|The Music Man was a great and classic movie and the viewing quality was great. I would definitely recommend it.
B002PMPTIO|5.0|Loved it, great action, great effects, and fresh take on the Star Trek story.  Chris Pine was great, and it was a great deal.
B0087HT36U|5.0|awesome game creative and challenging at the same time. hope more updates  come. pretty hard to get all the crowns....but in a good way
0345803485|5.0|It's a book that caught my interest. It's great. I'm not one for following trends, but like the Harry Potter series, so far this is a good book.
0439023483|4.0|SO glad I read this before the movie came out! It's so much better, and SUPER intense. I would rate this 5 stars, but I guess the characters just weren't relatable enough. STILL, you should totally buy this book, especially if you're into books that you just can't put down!
B0013KTGAG|5.0|This is one of my favorite “going to space to save the planet&#34; movies. The actors make this incredible mission  almost believable and the action is non-stop. Highly recommended.
1401224792|2.0|I'm a big enough fan to own all the Fables graphic novels so I just automatically preordered this one. Well, it was a Bigby the wolf solo story according to the cover and the blurb and that was enough for me to feel it was worth the money. Whoops, big mistake on my part. The first problem is the artwork, the series regular cover and interior artists are missing and it makes everything seem off. None of the characters carry the weight they generally do so all the story beats you would recognize from the other books are missing visually and the art is a bit weak.<br /><br />The blame can't land on the artist alone though. The story is very weak, there's really not anything else to find out other than what you see on the cover. Bigby runs into a bunch of other wolves that seem similar to him and he has to fight them.... and there is a blonde to protect. It sounds throwaway and derivative because it is, there's no sense of reason or consequence to anything and I could not find anything to care about. For a series fan, this should be as much of a slamdunk as finding a 4th Eastwood / Leone western, but it's just stale rote.<br /><br />In short, the story forms a thin grasping link between Bigby's WW2 adventure that acts as the precursor to a town full of werewolves that are related to him. They've been doing their thing in the heart of America for a few decades without any clear plan or purpose other than to be waiting around for Bigby to wander by so he can kill most of them and lament the poorer choices others with some of his abilities and none of his strengths have made before wandering off again. The whole thing is like an unfinished sentence, a half formed idea or partially remembered dream.... ie, terribly unsatisfying and a bit embarrassing once you try to share it with someone else and realize how little there was to the thing other than your personal feelings about it.<br /><br />I wouldn't expect that it will relate in any meaningful way to future Fable storiesbeyond a one sentence reference to 'that town with the werewolves I ran into last year' in a grasping attempt to make series fans like myself run out and buy a book they don't need. So if you are wondering if you need to pick this up because it ties into something else that might be important to the ongoing story.... I seriously doubt you need to worry, save your money and buy the Fables Covers by James Jean instead, its fantastic, this isn't.
B003H6KRIE|5.0|Wow !!!!!!!!!!!! What great movies these are. Each individual movie can stand alone. This is the best trilogy of movies I think I ever saw.  All are in 2:35:1 or 2:40:1 aspect ratio, which means you get to see all or most of the movie that the director wanted you to see. The Blu-Ray on all {3} movies is really nice. I have these in regular Dvd & the Blu-Ray blows them away. I can only say that the audio sounds really nice to me, although I listen with external speakers hooked up to my stereo, nothing fancy. All {3} movies have lots of special features that I think you will enjoy too. These movies have it all, Drama, Suspense & Action. The car chase scenes throughout the trilogy are probably the best I have ever seen. They were really well done. One of the best scenes was in the last movie where that guy was chasing the beautiful {I think} Nicki. The suspense & action was first rate. I really enjoyed these movies & I think you will too.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This season just keeps getting better and better. Action packed into every episode, you never know what's coming next. There are so many times during the show that have caused me to cry, panic, and scream at my computer while watching the newest episodes. I definetly can't wait for more to come out and I can't stop praising this show.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This one is very challenging for me!<br />Recommend it for any age group from youngster to adult.<br />Love the background music too!
B009SQRL4U|5.0|Whimsical,sweet,wonderful for the entire family.<br />A great message for appreciating our unique personalities and allowing us each to discover what we do best.
B009IKPOUO|5.0|No one sounds like Streisand. There is no mistaking the uniqueness of her voice, inflection and phrasing. If you're a fan and follower, that's enough reason to add this to your collection.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is similar to temple run, but designed for younger kids in mind. My kids enjoy playing this game than their other games on the itouch
0920668364|5.0|I read this at her celebration of life service. I used to read this book to my daughters when they were little and knew when the day came, I had to share this book.
B008I34ZFW|4.0|nice ,really nice. for such a low budget movie is really a surprise  for being so funny and  for the quality of the special effects.
0140714855|4.0|Another wonderful play by Shakespeare, this one introduces a wide array of characters that all come together to make an enjoyable play with many admirable details.
B002RVCD6O|4.0|I personally prefer Lord of the Rings.  Harry potter for the younger crowed. But after this film, a little more interesting.
1401225756|5.0|I originally bought this for a school class requirement, however after reading it I immediately bought the second volume. If you like comics and you don't mind a touch of darkness in your stories, this is a fantastic graphic novel to look into.<br />The storyline is original and done with classic but very well done artwork. Similarly, volume 2 continues the quality and thrill of reading as the first.
B009YU62H2|5.0|For any soundgarden fans: rest assured that this new studio album from the band is a complete return to form. What that means is this album feels as if the band never missed a beat and haven't been on hiatus all these years. This stems from the fact that some of these songs are older written but never put on any of their previous albums and that the band didn't attempt to stray from their more grungier roots for this outing.<br /><br />For rock fans: this is a solid album for fans of the genre due to the powerful vocals  and sonic guitar performances.
B00773YOB4|5.0|Slipstream is the best of both sides of Bonnie Raitt.  The classic blues sounds are in there, but for those who prefer her more pop side from albums like Nick of Time, there are tunes like her terrific remake of Gerry Rafferty's Right Down the Line and the terrific new song, Take My Love With You.
B0090EJR1K|1.0|When Sacha Cohen first came out with Borat, I thought his work to be hysterical.  Since Borat however, his movies have been steadily regressing downhill.  When I saw advertisements for The Dictator, I thought to myself, &#34;Maybe this will be his turnaround.&#34;  Since there are many angles one can use to make fun of tin-pot dictators, I earnestly looked forward to watching this movie.<br /><br />After the first 20 minutes, I gritted my teeth to get through the rest of the movie.  The humor was extremely dark, offensive, politically incorrect, and representative of the humor that would amuse a middle school or high school kid.  Despite employing all of the above in trying to elicit laughs, the movie was not funny at all!  I wanted to laugh and tried to find the jokes to be funny, but I couldn't even pretend or find any value in the humor whatsoever.  Complete waste of money... do not waste 120 min of your life.  You won't be able to get them or your $3.99 back.
B008LY5VHE|5.0|One of the first movies I remember watching in the late 70s. Scared me silly then, and still does. Looked good on dvd, great on blu-ray.
B006WQLH7G|4.0|Only thing I can recommend as an improvement is to make it automatic, however it is a good product as it is.
B003YHSE7W|2.0|I can handle the villians, but Black Widow seems out of place since shes only there for the Avengers setup. A so so sequel that should have at least passed on the whole &#34;War Machine&#34; subplot.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Easy read. Interesting insights and information. I did not see what all the legal puffing is about. I saw nothing that anyone who's served has not experianced. No secrets revieled.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|I had my fill of Marvel superhero movies since they were only being made to lauch the Avengers franchise. This is actually one of the best superhero movies every made. Thor actually evolves into a hero instead of just becoming one. Great SPX. Acting is top notch, and the storyline never goes over the top.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|I love watching this movie all year long. I have it on VHS but VCR broke and had to get a DVD.
B0064TVQ5E|1.0|Like I said I liked playing it but I didn't want to ruin my tablet for it. I wouldn't down load this game.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I purchased this multi-purpose sharpener to keep in my tool box, tackle box, and/or pocket.<br /><br />Obviously, this tool is not going to produce the results one could achieve with a series of ceramic grit stones, but it doesn't cost hundreds of dollars and can repair or restore a blade in less than a minute, so for the value and results, I judge it as excellent.<br /><br />This sharpener is superior to other pocket sharpeners I've used in that it has both a carbide sharpener for cleaning a jagged, damaged edge; a ceramic sharpener for refining a blade edge that is already reasonably sharp; and a conical, diamond-coated sharpener for serrated blades, fish hooks, and other irregular shapes.  Additionally, the design of this sharpener provides a larger space to securely hold the sharpener, which contributes to its ease of use and helps ensure the blade is drawn cleanly and straightly through the sharpener.  However, because this sharpener is designed primarily for sharpening knife blades, its design makes sharpening things like scissors, snips, saw teeth, and tools impracticable.  For such items, a small-diameter round file, or single blade carbide sharpener remains superior.<br /><br />Finally, the preset angle of the carbide and ceramic sharpeners take any guesswork out of sharpening a knife.  I grew up using wet stones and hand sharpening blades.  By contrast to the learning curve and time involved in using a wet stone, this device requires no skill.  Simply draw the blade across the sharpener with a slight downward tilt to the tip of the blade and apply enough pressure that you can still draw the blade continuously and smoothly across the sharpener.  If the blade stops, jams, or otherwise does not pull smoothly, reduce the downward pressure.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|Read the books too and you get ever more from this movie! I cannot wait until the others are released! Cant get enough of it
B005LAIHY0|4.0|Loved it. Filled in a lot of open spots for me.  And, the movie was good on it's own too.  Well done.
B000I9W08I|5.0|It was great. I love this musical. The definition was clear and precise and the sound track was awesome. Great buy!
B009VB7P6G|4.0|Good, its a good dis and plays well. I would watch it again and again with my kids. Joy to watch
B009VB7QQA|4.0|Of course the book was much better, but the movie was interesting and held my attention! for through the whole thing.
1596434252|5.0|Got this book for my graphic design student daughter that loved it! Raved on and on and thinks it is the coolest book
B009LROCJI|4.0|A refreshing take on a comfortable old shoe. It's fun to listen for familiar bits and wonder at the expansions.
B00007GZQZ|5.0|Since this movie was a classic in my house growing up, when I found it on DVD instead of the VHS I knew I had to buy it!
B00A12Z264|5.0|Love this album. &#34;Just A Fool&#34; and &#34;Blank Page&#34; are my favorite songs. &#34;Army of Me&#34; is a revamped Stronger. &#34;Cease Fire&#34; is a great song given the war we are in.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This season stands on its own, or is a treat to watch in conjunction with the first two seasons. Would recommend season 3 to fans of the show.
B008D1LVRY|5.0|It's time to build a bigger god! The sound quality isn't that great. Buy the CD instead. Or get both and show your support for the music you love.
0470913029|4.0|Most interesting read and theory. I have been following similar diet and it was great to compare. Reccommend to anyone who wants to stay healthy but of course talk to your doctor first.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Wes Anderson's best.  By far.  The out-of-nowhere stars are amazing, and the film is stylized just enough that the kitschiness doesn't overwhelm the story.
B007DVF5CC|5.0|This was a surprise to me when we found it. I Iike the actors and the story and filiming were excellent. It was a fun film, set in a mysterious time and the sets were wonderful.  A good entertaining plot, sexy women and dashing gentlemen.  I watched and then viewed it again with my wife.
B0083Z614S|5.0|Burnett's classic gets an update in a new format.  There is something pleasantly ironic reading a hundred year old book on cutting edge technology.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|There are not enough rating stars! The BEST show ever. However if they kill Darryl I will have to quit watching!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I read this when it first came out and gave the book to a friend. I bought this kindle version because I wanted to read it again before I saw the movie version. I liked it even more this time because I read it more slowly and enjoyed the beautiful writing. I think it is a classic. Who can ever forget Richard Parker?
B00005AXKF|1.0|I could not use it and had to ship it back at my own expense.  I live in American and this is a European formated dvd.  Make sure you are buying American made stuff.  Asian and European electronics do not play well with American electronics.
B00005JL0I|5.0|A fun spoof on James Bond. A fun addition to any James Bond collection. Product came as promised. No problems what so ever.
B00846REIS|3.0|The characters were not the type of people I could relate to, a little too short-tempered.  They didn't seem to have as deep a love for each other as some characters in other books.
1851775722|5.0|I have enjoyed this book very much. I love fashion and history. The book arrived quickly and is exactly as I expected. I would  recommend this to anyone that shares the same interests.
B004GVUPFE|4.0|I waisted a whole day playing this game. Perfect for my new Kindle fire. Sound get annoying, but you can turn it off.
B00004WEJZ|5.0|Always been a Sean Connery fan in any film. 007 is a fun series, have watched since I can remember. No problems in receiving the product. Everything was as promised.
B008BSPQ3E|4.0|This would have been perfect had they included all of the special extended versions and remixes of the songs. As an example I have a 12&#34; single of Sledgehammer and none of the tracks that are on that single are in this set. If you are gonna charge $100 for a box set of a single album MAKE IT COMPLETE!!! I do like the DNA disc although I would have liked to hear complete demos. The sound quality seems pretty good although not a giant improvement over previous versions. The high resolution audio files included as a download were a great addition, probably the biggest reason for me to decide to buy this box. I would say if you are not a big fan of Peter Gabriel or this album and you have a version of this album already don't buy this. There isn't enough in here to justify the cost unless you like live albums and high resolution audio files.
B004AGI2L4|5.0|Interesting take away on the story.  Great acting by the cast, direction great, crew & editing great.  Bought the dvd.
B0087240Z4|5.0|IMHO, some of Corgan's best work. If you are a Pumpkins fan, definitely pick up this album. Solid continuation of the band's work.
0345803493|5.0|I bought the 1st some place else  and was HOOKED on it so got the last 2  thru Amazon.  I wanted to wait for a nice snowing evening to start reading  but once I picked up the 1st book  , I couldnt put it down.  So  I dd read them all with in days of the m. Altho contentis very  adult, the story line was great.  I will probablt read them again in the next few months  Great read for ladies.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|Some of the scenes from this movie have become traditional laughs for my family.  Love the Yuppie couple next door that are too &#34;sophisticated&#34; for Christmas, and I love the overall theme of the movie that Christmas is for going all-out for your family.  There are all the favorite characters from the &#34;Vacation&#34; movie - cousin Eddie and his family; the sexy blond model; plus some new characters - the inlaws.  If you haven't seen the movie be warned that there's a cat that gets electrocuted by chewing on Christmas lights, but it's done in a funny way, but some cat-lovers may not like it.  Anyway, I'm a cat lover and it doesn't really bother me because the whole movie is done in a positive way, looking at all the craziness and disasters that can happen at Christmas, including having to put up with visiting in-laws, and there's going to be something in this movie that makes you say - &#34;that happened to us one year!&#34;  For us, it was the overcooked turkey - we had one almost as bad as the Griswold's turkey!  The Griswold kids are actually very loving and supportive of their parents while still being typical kids, bored one minute and excited the next, and Ellen is great as usual.  The last scenes about the &#34;kidnapping&#34; of Clark's boss are absolutely hysterical and the best part, in my opinion.  Good movie.
0345803507|5.0|Couldnt  this one down either  REad them all  within days of getting them  WAnted to save for a snowy day  but read 1st pages  and it didnt last bt a few days.  GREat Reading  ladies..........adult content but great story line
B0087ITC9C|4.0|PROS:<br /><br />- Performances. Everyone gave great performances. John Goodman is barely in this movie (probably under 15 minutes?), but man, what a scene stealer! He alone makes this movie worth seeing.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />- Length. They could've easily cut out at least 20 minutes from this movie. By itself it's 2:18 hours, but before that (assuming you're going to see this in the theater) you have to sit through 22 minutes of trailers.<br /><br />- Plot went a little off-track. I thought they spent too much time on the character of the woman Whip gets involved with, and spent all the time on her addiction issues.
B009LK6JS2|1.0|I could not steer the plane at all.  I attempted to get help with the game instructions but could not access those in game either.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|Definitely Oscar-worthy! I think what I most appreciated was the character development. You really get to know what makes the characters tick, allowing the viewer to really care about them. The performances are superb. I highly recommend this one!
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|I bought this because I missed this episode. It was a great recording. Thanks for the access to missed episodes,
B00002ZMNV|5.0|This is a high risk for both parties and it pays off big time. Mixing Metal with a classical orchestra turns out to be an excellent idea. What is kind of funny is seeing all the old people in the orchestra that are like &#34;I just wanna get paid and get out.&#34; But what is really amazing is the last song &#34;Battery&#34;. Adding an orchestra to a Thrash Speed Metal song is amazing and calls on very strong concentration on the orchestra. This is something you need to watch.
B0060FXDCG|1.0|I bought the box set and was unable to watch any of them.  The discs were totally messed up, one disc froze every two seconds, the other jumped around and the third didn't even play.  What were they referbs?
B000ID37T0|5.0|No cell phones or computers.  but that's okay, because the ideas are timeless. The last scene is a contrivance.  the next to last scene is a heart-stopper.  Beautiful and profound.
0316228532|4.0|Coming from Rowling's Harry Potter series to her first book for adults, I had not anticipated how much it would remind me of the novels of Jane Austen.  Austen famously worked with a small canvas, focusing on the foibles and concerns of residents of small and insular communities. Rowling does the same. If one imagines Austen transplanted to the present, freed from any pressure to adhere to romantic conventions, and urged to give reign to all her darker and more cynical impulses, we might have something like this novel.<br /><br />To be sure, the Harry Potter series does showcase Rowling's impressive ability to paint compelling and unflattering portraits. But in those books, characters like Cornelius Fudge and the wonderfully detestable Dolores Umbridge act as antagonists or foils for likeable and admirable characters.  In A Casual Vacancy, they comprise most, if not all, of the human landscape. One's response to almost every character is essentially: \\"My God, I hope I'm not like that.\\"<br /><br />Some reviews have stated that the only likable or admirable character in this book is the man who dies at its beginning, and whose death occasions the entire plot. I would qualify this statement in two ways. First, there are a couple of other characters who do worthwhile jobs as best they can, against discouraging odds. However, even these characters are sufficiently flawed and foolish in various aspects of their personal lives as to prevent the reader from wishing to identify with them. Second, this limitation extends to some extent to the soon-departed Barry Fairbrother. While there are reasons (starting with the character's unsubtle name) to believe that we are intended to side with him in the dispute over Pagford's responsibility for the Fields housing project, his view of that project and of certain of its residents could be fairly characterized as somewhat one-sided and optimistic. It is even clearer that his tireless advocacy leads him to neglect aspects of his family life.<br /><br /> At one point, Rowling has a character recall the W.B. Yeats line, \\"A pity beyond all telling/ is hid at the heart of love.\\" For much of the book, one might question whether Rowling feels that pity. In the end, I was more or less persuaded that she does. She ultimately succeeds in making the reader care, to a varying extent, about the fates of these deeply flawed characters. The book is thus eventually moving, rather than merely disheartening.y life.<br /><br /> At one point, Rowling has a character recall the W.B.

This book is an excellent read for those interested in exploring the mysteries of the the spiritual world through the world of neuro-science. However, for those wanting a practical approach and just every day contentment try 'The Psychology of Happiness and Well-being'.

0812984412|5.0|Cloud Atlas is an enjoyable read. The structure of the novel makes it interesting--but also creates difficulties. Only the sixth story can be read straight through, and the reader must keep the other five first halves of stories in mind while absorbing the impact of five emotional endings.<br /><br />While views on reincarnation often involve a soul making progress toward an ideal through a series of lives, that isn't true in Cloud Atlas. The \\"recurring\\" character is altruistic in the first story, for instance, and then an unrepentant self-centered self-promoter in the second. I never was able to make sense of the progression.<br /><br />The book was always clever, however, and engrossing and imaginative. It was also a bit depressing to see a few humane people constantly trying to hold back an endless, ageless sea of cruelty and depravity.

B001NLKXK2|5.0|This book help me understand a little about the confusion she goes through.  It is written well.<br />I really recomment it for any caregiver
B009FZFONO|5.0|Best show ever.  Great suspense, excellent real-life characters, unsuspecting drama.  I was skeptical at first do to no-name actors, but most of the ones currently on the show have done a great job in bringing the audience a captivating story.
B000SEGUDE|3.0|This book has an interesting premise of reincarnation moving over centuries of time.  The author went to outlandish levels to create various unique words and dialectial forms but kept throwing in normal words to the point of creating a silly confusing read. I went to the movie just to insure that I correctly understood what I was reading. I would recommend this book to readers who enjoy unusual stories and are willing to work at understanding \\"created\\" words.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|A good game that was well worth the $1 I spent on it. It was a little short however and I still have a few questions that it didn't answer.
B009YU62H2|1.0|It was lame, I mean worse than Chris's solo album. No good grungy songs, and almost all of them had the same tone.
B009HV2JT8|1.0|I didn't hate it because I didn't see it, but one star was the least of the choices.  For some reason it never showed up in my video library.  It was only a rental and I am only out $1.99.  Don't know what happened????
B007HPO3CC|5.0|I love this series. I started watching it and couldn't stop til the last episode. Its great if you love action, romance, betrayal and the game.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|More exciting than the first series. I've only seen 7 episodes so far. When the episode concludes, it leaves you craving for more!!!
B0001I561E|5.0|Love the fact that I can get all the classic Disney movies for my niece. It was a great addition to her Disney Collection.
B0027MJU00|5.0|This is an excellent book. I couldn't put it down. It flowed nicely and kept me interested the entire time. I typically pride myself on being able to figure out &#34;whodunit&#34; fairly early in the book. I had tons of suspects but do not have it figured out until the end. This was a great read and I can not wait to see what Gillian Flynn comes up with next.
0788859544|5.0|Love that I can watch one of my favorite childhood movies with my niece now. A great addition to our Disney Collection.
B00A6N8F4Y|4.0|Thought it wouldn't be good seeing how it wasn't in the theaters, but it was well put together! Definitely worth watching!
B000E1ZBGS|2.0|I love this movie; one of my favorites.  The quality of the dvd is poor.  It hesitates throughout the whole movie.  I have yet to return it (life has been very busy) but I intend to.  Because I haven't returned it yet, I cannot comment on customer service.
B007EECSFA|4.0|This is a well-written novel that keeps the reader guessing right up to the end.  I particularly liked the way the author managed to tell the story through three different perspectives and yet kept the action moving without needless repetition.  A daughter is only able to escape her own demons when she pursues those that have afflicted her mother.  Her answers eventually satisfy her, and the reader is able to receive the full story which is even more satisfying.  Every one  of us keeps many secrets and most of them will never by told.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I love this show so out there and awesome!! If you want something different this is the show for you.
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|This album is traditional Christmas songs done with a Pentatonix Twist.  The songs bring the memories of years past with a contemporary essence that ensures the songs will not grow old by the end of the Christmas Season.<br />The group is respectful and true to the songs.<br />It is a great gift for anyone; appropriate for children thru octogenarians!
B008I3QZKU|5.0|I wasn't sure what to make of this album at first. Upon first listen, \\"Flesh and Bone\\" drew me right in, but I couldn't decide about the rest of it. I listened to the CD over and over for the next few weeks, and I grew to love it more each time I heard it. Usually it's the albums that take a little time to grow on me that eventually become my favorites, and Battle Born is no exception. After a little time, I started to appreciate elements that I didn't notice at first. If you have only listened to it a few times and don't love it, give it another chance.<br /><br />I would summarize this album as having an American `80s retro sound. However, it's delivered with genuineness and affection, not an ironic hipster wink. There is often a Springsteen-esque sound, such as in \\"Runaways\\" and \\"A Matter of Time.\\" But there are Brit pop elements to be found, too, especially in \\"Deadlines and Commitments\\" which sounds exactly like something you could've seen on VH1 in 1987 (which, to me, is a good thing). In other places, the music is driving and powerful such as in \\"Flesh & Bone\\" and \\"Battle Born.\\" The ballads \\"The Way It Was\\" and \\"Here With Me\\" round the album off nicely. There are a few semi-duds in the last half of the album, but even those tracks are worth a listen now and then. Brandon's voice is in top form on this album, better than I've ever heard him before. That alone is reason enough to give it a chance. I'm giving the album five stars, despite the few tracks I don't love, because the album as a whole is better than 99% of the other music out there right now. I couldn't bear to take it out of the CD player in my car for weeks on end after getting it, which says a lot.<br /><br />I feel that this was a risky album for The Killers to make, and I appreciate that about it. They made the music they wanted to make, knowing they'd probably get a lot of criticism for it. So much of today's music is formulaic and uninteresting, so I respect bands that take risks and make greatmusic at the expense of getting top radio hits and a lot of airplay.

B00A3AYI50|5.0|THE MUSIC AND THE VOCALS ARE AMAZING. SUCH TALENT. Me ,my husband ,and my 17 years old son love it.
B00A4GXJD0|3.0|I loved rock and roll jesus.  I don't see myself listening to this cd to many times.  Come on lets ride!!
B000U0F7RG|5.0|I bought this because my 19 year old daughter and I got hooked on the first two seasons late this summer.  We have Gilmore Girls marathons when she comes home for college breaks-where we watch at least eight episodes at a time.  I haven't laughed at one liners ever, as much as I laugh at the ones on GG.  The characters are well developed, the interactions are so heartwarming, and often hilarious!  I think the bond between Rory and her mom is one my daughter and I share also-which makes the watching of it a bonding experience!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Good quick read book. I was surprised that I enjoyed the story. Didn't want to read it because I didn't think the movie looked that great. A friend told me that she enjoyed it so I thought I would try it. Glad I did.
B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|Another hit by Linkin Park. It's new territory for them and it works. When compared to their early stuff, it's different, but it's still classic Linkin Park.
B00008G7UJ|4.0|This version of Shakespeare's classic tragedy is loud, colorful, and exciting. It is not for the faint of heart, but fans of Shakespeare's work will see the beauty in this adaptation.
1612680011|5.0|I would highly recommend this book to any one no matter how educated or uneducated they are about finances and cash flow. If you have no education or background in finances and how cash flow works, then this is a great book that helps you understand the basics and fundamentals of its teachings. Everything is in simple terminology and easy to understand examples!!!
B009A3NGF4|5.0|Mumford and Sons is one of the best groups to gain popularity in the past few years and this album does not disappoint. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B009KS4XRO|1.0|Then after you get hooked. You have to pay. Very unhappy. I loved the game but it cost a lot and I had to pay to download it.
B0045EA1P6|5.0|Fun's first album is quirky and upbeat. It's unique, interesting, and great to listen to. If you are a fan of Fun, this album will be perfect for you!
0066620996|5.0|If you like management this is the book to read. This book teaches you all the good practices to have a great company.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|It's obvious that the bulk of the work i done for iOS and the non-Amazon branded Android OS.  The app only loads one part of my timeline nd then stops.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|my first app at every launch.  perfect..... it provides all the specs I need to start using my kindle fire.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|Fantastic.  Loved it so much I bought the ad free version (has extras too)  Do not mind contributing to such a well done app
B009E3EY38|2.0|This concert video has it's stare of problems from the get-go, but what idiot decided to unrelentingly keep cutting directly to that ugly and annoying video screen in the back ground? That screen is annoying throughout the concert when it's just there in the live shots of the performers, so why focus on it directly?
B000FA675C|5.0|Dan Brown launched a whole new genra of mysteries with this book. Even if you just want to read about great art and the world it lives in you won't be dissappointed by The Da Vinci Code.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|very addictive and fun. give it try! but let me be honest it is not as easy as it looks.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|I love DMB and I hate American Idol, but Phillip Phillips has been playing all week.  This album is well written and produced.  Commercial, yes, but definitely has that independent spirit to it that makes me love it!
B005XI4WFS|5.0|is Jessica Lange, always?  I love her in this.  This series is really unbelievably unique, too.  I wasn't sure about it, but I decided to give it a shot and I'm hooked!  It is very suspenseful - I can't wait to find out what will happen next.  So creepy... Also, Connie Britton is my new fav - love her in \\"Nashville\\" as well.  In general, all of the acting is superb in AHS.
B009YG2ND8|5.0|well worth the money  this is a very expansive game and very customizable.  a must have for any rpg lover
B00A77II0U|5.0|This was a great game. Kindle needs more games like this. This game was definitely worth the price of 2.99.
B004SBQGHS|4.0|I have three grandchildren, ages 5, 9, and 11.  They are able to take turns with the game as they advance through the levels.  They also enjoy playing it alone.  I think it is a great game for kids and even adults, as I had trouble getting the angle correct at times.  Well worth the price.
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|The songs are all really great!  I especially love &#34;Carol of the bells&#34; and &#34;O Holy night&#34;.  A superb addition to my Christmas song collection!
B004NOCCEG|4.0|my husband and i watched this and we really enjoyed the information presented. makes you think twice about the retirement account!
B006LSZECO|4.0|This mystery is one that's hard to put down. It was selected by our book club for discussion. Told by the two main characters in alternating chapters, it pulls you in one direction then another. Wouldn't be surprised if this one becomes a movie.
B007N5YIUS|4.0|It was pretty ingenious how it brought science into fun and makes the imagination wonder! Loved the old Atari come back mini games in the golden egg stages! Kinda like future meets retro theme! Great for kids to play...and the kid-at-heart!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Why piling up your precious DSLR accessories in a crowded bag, instead of using this backpack?<br />Highly recommended, very practical and comfortable.
B00A3DZ61W|4.0|Since the Space version, this has truly upgraded the graphics and skills each bird has and makes getting the piggies even funner!<br />Just one thing is the stars, if you have to get the plants to get all three stars sometimes that part is annoying.<br />But still totally recommend it!
B0083P1QUM|3.0|It was very slow starting and basically boring, but once you get into the book, then it starts rolling.  From about 1/3 mark till end of the book is very good.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|pretty interesting game, would buy it if i had a debit card... a little disappointed i cant continue the game... it said &quot;free version&quot; not &quot;demo version&quot;. but it was a pretty cool game..
B009LK6JS2|1.0|My son is 11 years old.  He was not impressed with the game & after only playing it a few times, it crashed his Kindle so he deleted the game.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|This is an excellent meaning with a great new meaning for brave.  This will encourage all to embrace their fearless nature!
B006LSZECO|3.0|I was disappointed with this book.  It did not meet my expectations.  There was so much hype about t, I thought it did not meet the hype.
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|The importance of family and relationship is highlighted in this and the dangers of being impetuous. It was a fun family friendly movie that promoted good family relationships.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Loved it.  Suspensfull to the last page!  I have read many of Baldacci's book.  They ar all wonderful.  I would definately rcommend all his books .
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|Haven't read the book, but the film is a preposterous future fantasy death game for young adults. Lots of emotional issues and such to grapple with. Sort of a combination of Lord of the Flies and The Running Man. Young adults would probably like it.
B009YU62H2|5.0|I've listened to Chris Cornell's on his own efforts, a man with an incredible voice, and it is good to here him back with his old mates.  If it didn't ROCK, I wouldn't have bought it.
B009CGLO3K|4.0|Good movie interesting story and the visuals were great. My wife kids and I all really enjoyed the movie will deffinately watch it again.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|This movie is great, and worth watching many a time. The opening sequence could practically be a short film on its own. You don't need to be a star trek fan to enjoy it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I Love this show! I was skeptical at first because I'm not to big into zombies and don't really like horror but this show is fantastic. Makes you think, &#34;what if?&#34; I highly suggest watching it from the beginning of season one
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|it is awesome do not listen to bad comments get it.  if u do not spnd prizes it makes the game even better.  GET IT
1451695195|5.0|Being a physician myself, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. If you think he has anything to profit by discussing this issue in front of the medical community you are mistaken. There are many physicians who will ridicule him for his experience. I do believe in its veracity. Having seen the devastation caused by E. coli meningitis, it is a miracle that he can put 2 sentences together. Bravo Dr. Alexander for your courage!<br />Marian May, M.D.
B005AERS74|5.0|Maroon 5 has been my favorite band for years. I love the music and Adam Levine, the lead singer, is pretty hot. I could never give them a bad review, no matter way because i love them so much.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Nothing more to say. Better than the theater with my setup. Great clarity and audio. Could've used more extras, but no knocks for it.
145162607X|4.0|an interesting novel. looked forward to reading it as i love Philippa's writing.am always pleased to learn historical facts,and ancient words
B00271SFB6|5.0|Better video editing than quantum of solace and definitely the first Daniel Craig bond film you should watch. Buy before you watch skyfall
B008MG1E4A|2.0|The author seemed to be more interested in building himself up than really telling the details of the the story.  More in this book about training rather than the actual mission.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|Every bit as good as the first. Guy Ritchie has created gritty yet gorgeous scenes and a tight story line. Jared Harris was the perfect choice for Moriarty.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|One of hhis best.  That is a tough call because all of his books are so good.  Couldn't put the old kindle down until the end.
B00000IQW5|5.0|I'm not big on chick flicks or romances but this movie is more than that. It's about learning to let go and unselfishness. The main character played by Dreyfuss learns taht real love is when you want what's bst for the one you love instead of what you want.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|This is a quick and easy way to check your ebay purchases and bids without having to go to a bunch of extra trouble.  Very convenient for someone without a lot of time, but wants to stay on top of their bids!
B001NAT07A|4.0|I wanted to show my daughter this movie.  It isn't as I remember it.  The video quality was exceptional.  I don't think she liked the movie itself.
B0090YHSFC|5.0|It was great - easy to use and one of the best free game apps I've received! I'd recommend it to others.
B008YZXYY2|5.0|Best cf of the year by far. Best Stone Sour disc. Once you listen to it you will be hooked
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love playing this on my kindle fire! One of the better apps to download! I play it all the time!
B008KE3960|5.0|lots of game play, if you like tower defence games. get this game its plenty of hours of replay value.  the air planes are really fun and its a new twist to the genere
0446585025|2.0|This book was alright. I thought it was entertaining and made me laugh a few times but I also felt as though it had no point to it. She talks to the reader a lot which isn't very entertaining and in one chapter she goes on and on about how she has something important to tell you but tells you one sentence that was dumb. I almost had to skip that chapter because it irritated me so much. I might try her other books though because she can be funny and it's an easy read.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I love these books, even though they are less advanced reading material than I am used to.  The story is great, and reading it on my kindle is even better!  I'm glad I no longer have to cart around actual books all the time, and if I finish one and want to start the next one I have it right there at my fingertips.
B006VREHRS|4.0|A gratuitus series but well written and very well scored. 4 out of 5. Looking forward to watching season 3
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|I was surprised at how clever this movie is. Very imaginative and lots of fun. The triplets are a scream--little devils.<br /><br />Don't let the \\"animated\\" descriptive put you off. This movie is more entertaining than most films.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|My wife accidentally deleted an episode from our dvr recordings and we had to purchase this show from Amazon. Video and audio were excellent. Price was reasonable.
B00AA7O22U|4.0|If you don't expect too much this is the ultimate action movie. A stellar cast of Hollywood action actors makes this film a truly escapist classic.
0525953728|5.0|Great book that I couldn't put down for a minute. Was well written and easy to follow. It makes us older vets very<br />proud of the ones who took our place.
B00A135YUW|5.0|The Gangsta Nancy Sinatra...  The Female Johnny Cash!  Lana Del Ray has created a fresh sound that is both contemporary & classic at the same time!
1452110581|5.0|This book is absolutely hysterically funny.  Every person who is owned by a cat should have this little book!  Great gift idea too.
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|The Gangsta Nancy Sinatra...  The Female Johnny Cash!  Lana Del Ray has created a fresh sound that is both contemporary & classic at the same time!
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|This is a great addition to the Marvel series of films. All of the actors pull off their characters brilliantly.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Certainly an amazing movie that goes deeper into Bond. Can't wait till it comes out on DVD and BLU-Ray. Always a Bond fan!
B005O30Y5Y|5.0|This is a great series. The finale may be the best of all of them. The main stars have grown up in these roles and are wonderous.
B00A6N7BS0|4.0|My husband and I liked this movie.The movie was very well done, good story, great cast, great acting but a little too violent.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Amazing story line with history of WWII.  Ken Follett brings the characters to life while keeping the integrity of history.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|My husband and kids love Angry Birds. They were excited to see this new one and just love it! Its different and fun. I would recommend on buying this game. Keeps everyone entertained.
B0078X2LKY|5.0|I am going to be reading this to my children! A classic from my childhood that will never grow old.
B00338QENI|5.0|Wonderful to know she lives in Heaven and on earth.  She will continue to help science assist people who are very ill.
B009E9QOEO|3.0|I'll stick with the CDs. As much as I would like to see the band, I won't buy the Blu-Ray, because of the horrible editing. Why didn't they use a single wide-angle camera that captures the entire stage? This way the viewer at home would feel as though he is sitting at the actual show. Shame on everyone involved into production of this shambolic video. So disappointing!!! I don't understand how Led Zeppelin could agree to such obviously ignominious output.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Was disappointed with that last section of this work. For some reason it left me feeling it wasn't completed. Sorry.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|I love this game! If you love Uno like I love Uno you will enjoy this game. It's like playing in a game with people without the cards. I highly recommend this.
B004JUTHVK|5.0|I enjoy all of their music, this one included.  I wish they were still turing the USA for their shows.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Starting out you might think oh, this game is too easy but it gets harder and harder.  It is a great way to pass the time.
B007WOA3L8|3.0|So it was great to be able to download this one while in Armenia. It's serviceable, but I found it hard to locate sights and areas I wanted to see. That could have been due to the electronic format or I was just used to the other book.
B009ZAY8MM|3.0|My wife was really excited about this, but was disappointed by an average-sounding Christmas album. The songs are very mellow for a group that usually displays so much fun and energy.
B009G78EE2|5.0|Buy it now.  Only wish they had the uncensored CD version available on amazon.  It's so refreshing to listen to a rapper that doesn't rap about hoes, drugs and violence.
B009VB7P6G|5.0|my daughter loves  TinkerBell this was a great movie for her. it's really nice to see that even though it's the 4th tinkerbell movie out now it's just as good as the 1st.
B004GFN11A|4.0|Great program. Does everything I want it to except it will not allow me to clock on the monthly graph bars to see totals for a month. When it does, I'll give it 5 stars.
B004LWZW4M|5.0|This is a great movie; I just love Ceasar and Franco!!!  Ceasar would make a great friend!!  I love the way Franco has such good emotions in this movie.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Lovable believable characters, that you really felt for. I felt the ending was rushed, but otherwise a very entertaining read.
B000LTAY1U|1.0|Don't like the strap at all. It's shiny and cheap looking. Also they say it will stay charged for days and always shortly after I take it off or definitely by the morning it's stopped running and I have to reset it again. Maybe I don't move my arms enough or something....
B005LAJ16I|5.0|I wanted to watch them ending because each episode ended with a question you wanted answered immediately.I can't wait until I can get the second season!
B008JGSM6G|1.0|I didnt have a fun flow free experience.  It was free but I still spent too much on it.  PASS on paying.
B009NQKPUW|1.0|A mess of distorted voices and cartoon-grade monsters.  Everyone in this film had some sort of bizarre accent; I just used the subtitles.  Designed to represent diversity, no doubt; apparently the homogenization of language evident in our own age will reverse itself in the future when the Scotsmen from Monty Python conquer the Universe.  Casting Rapace is, as always, just being odd for its own sake; she's just as out of place here as in every other role she gets.  Why are so many film makers forgetting the audience needs to like at least ONE of the characters? Otherwise the reaction is just &#34;finally!&#34; when each kicks the bucket.  The plot was dull, the denouement was comical.  Surely a savvy business executive as played by Theron could figure out when confronted with the giant rolling spaceship-donut (science fiction or an episode of the Simpsons?), to turn left and walk twenty feet, or, as the pre-teen in the room said, &#34;run sideways!&#34;  The Prometheus sacrifices itself for no compelling reason, though the bizarre facial expression Elba makes just before the end comes from below the waist.  No rhyme or reason other than to go back in time and blame humanity for the alien rage.  Fassbender is good playing the role of the chorus, but otherwise a waste of time.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Awesome book, This was my first book I read on Heaven, I seen the author on Fox news and decided to read this book. I down loaded it to my Kindle Fire. Enjoyed reading this book.
B000ZHCQ5U|5.0|A classic; especially for Boomers who had to live thru the cold war. Viewers might want to Google character names 'cause some of them, aside from the obvious Spanish-derived names, were not randomly chosen.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|The series was shockingly good. I didn't expect much as I'd never heard of it before, but it was a great deal as an ebook so I got it.My only gripe would be that I wish it was longer.
B009FBX5M0|4.0|Skyfall CD from Amazon:  I ordered the CD Skyfall for gifts and one for myself.  The CD is described as the \\"original motion picture soundtrack\\".  I was expecting Adele to be included as part of the sound track.  After hearing no Adele, I found in very small print on the back of the CD - \\"This album does not include a recording by the artist Adele\\".  We were all disappointed.  This information should be noted on the description of the CD.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|Excellent book with some very high level concepts. I felt both that I was enjoying the book as i was reading it while also getting the feeling that I was learning a little something about humanity.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This book made me laugh out loud at times & at other times brought tears to my eyes. Wonderfully written. I found myself thinking about the characters long after I finished the book. Don't let the low price of this book steer you away, it's a steal and would be worth double or even triple the price!
B0026IWNZ4|5.0|Brings a smile to my face just thinking abot it. British humour, clever animation, heart-warming story. Loved it. I suppose small kids might find the nasty cat scary but otherwise it's fun for all.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I feel this show is a great example of how humanity would deal with world ending situations and gives many people something to think about how quickly life as we know it could be taken away from us.
B009ANAQ4S|5.0|Must have for the Van Morrison fan. Sexy, mature, intimate best describes this collection of songs. Pour  a glass of wine and and get ready to groove. Love this man's voice.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|I order DVD's for my grandchildren to watch on Thanksgiving day.  This year I sent The Muppet Christmas Carol DVD as a surprise to one of the families.  This is so Mom can do some cooking and Dad can watch his football games.  This makes less stress on everyone.
B00AA7O22U|3.0|I gave this movie three stars! And I mean it! Nothing short of three stars!! This has some of the worst best, best worst acting I've ever seen. And the diamond drill bit drilling machine!! Who else but Sly can afford to throw one of those in to his movies? And those sexy boy black outfits. Oh, so sensual. What a bunch of great guys. Killing, maiming, looting, exploding and snapping off snarky one liners... All in the name of Justice! American Style! Two points if you can can guess, Who'll Be Back! Well He is!! And the poor king cobra, who suffered through five days of agonizing torture, after he made the Ultimate Mistake of biting the One Person in the movie who, well, if you can't figure out who I'm talking about, you're not going to have much fun here. Really, after fifteen minutes, the real amazement I felt came while watching Sly ticker tape lines off his mouth like he was getting paid a million bucks a second- didn't matter just how dumb the dialogue was, he just had to stand and deliver. Get the damn scene over with and the way you do that, is you say this here line of dialogue and then, We get to move on to the Next Scene, and that's how you make the fkkn movie. Move along now. Simply amazing. I mean it. Sly stands there and, for an actor, he's in some bizarro zen space where what his dialogue partner says almost doesn't even seem to matter. It's like, you can see the crawl just below his face, (I'm waitin' for you to finish your dialogue so we can get to the next scene) It's almost like he occupies the dialogue himself, because everything is so prescribed. Amazing.
B000P0J09W|5.0|Every year I order DVD's for my grandchildren to watch on Thanksgiving day.  This year I sent THE GOONIES DVD as a surprise this is so Mom can do some cooking and Dad can watch his football games.  This makes less stress on everyone.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|i got this on my kindle and its a great game and all but its not up to date. I have this on my ipod and the counterfeit machene was payable by coins. the grafics are great.
B00783NWB6|5.0|I have both of these movies in it's 2D format. I love them both; especially the 'Underworld' series. Awakening is probably the best of the series..and 3D makes it all that more appealing. This is a 'must buy' if you like the 'Underworld' series
B00A77II0U|5.0|This game is incredible. You couldn't ask for anything more out of a game. The storyline was so fantastic. Graphics were great. The hidden objects were done very nice not so difficult to find items and no to easy. The puzzles are good. I would highly recommend this game, well worth the money.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|I love movies about the possibility of 'Aliens'. This is one of the best movies I've seen about the subject.
1878424319|1.0|Moronic, sophomoric.<br />When someone writes a book like this, they can either<br />1) Use common words for their concepts, explaining how THEY're going to redefine this word, or<br />2) Use 'foreign' words (in this case, Toltec) to define their concepts, or<br />3) Make up new words, like &#34;grok&#34;, or &#34;supercalifragilisticexpialidocious&#34;.<br /><br />-None- is satisfactory, and he uses all three !<br /><br />The book can't be followed.  And it - at the outset - requires false premises, like &#34;You didn't decide on your religion; it was handed down to you by your parents&#34; to be accepted.<br /><br />I only read in maybe a dozen pages, then realized what a waste of time it would be, for me, to continue.<br /><br />Gah.
B003O86FMW|4.0|The book started off slow but by the end of the second chapter I was hooked. The ending was great didn't see that coming.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Look forward to this every week. Season three sure had a lot of drama and sparse action. My favorite show on tv though.
B008OGJXJ6|5.0|Have always loved anything Bob Dylan does, but the 1st song very nice to dance to & extremely cheerful sound..beautiful & the 2nd is very romantic & touches the heart...all so wonderful & as usually new interesting sounds & lyrics with this wonderful artist.
