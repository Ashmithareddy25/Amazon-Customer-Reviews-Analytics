B000301YY8|5.0|I LOVED \\"You are Beautiful\\" the first fifty times I heard it on the radio in France.  By the end of the summer, I switched radio stations every time it came on.  Then I went back to the States and forgot about it a while until I found out that I really missed that song.  So I bought this CD.    \\"You are Beautiful\\" is definitely the greatest love song of the millenium, and I really liked \\"No Bravery\\" and \\"Good-bye My Love\\".  Most of his songs are sad and bittersweet, and his voice is great! All the other songs are so great.  I think JB has the most beautiful male voice on earth (wel, maybe not as good as J.B.Maunier, but still)    I recommend this for anyone who enjoyed \\"Beautiful\\" because many of the songs are in the same theme.  It's a bit pricy, so don't buy it unless you've already had a dose of Blunt.  I'm officially hooked!
0780622553|5.0|Way back in the dawn of middle school, I used to play a role-palying game called UnderWorld. As I was looking through the player's guide, I came across a list of movies I could watch that helped inspire the game. Since this movie was on it and I'd heard it mentioned before in connection with one of my favorite authors, I decided to give it a try, following the instructions the UnderWorld guide gave me to skip over the opening introduction. <br /> <br />Almost two hours later, I was in love. <br /> <br />The plot is very meticulous, so I'll only reveal a part of it: John Murdoch wakes up in a bathtub with no memory of who he is or where he's been. Seeing an oddly-shaped syringe nearby, he immediately flees the scene, stopping to save a goldfish dying on the floor. As he goes through his pockets, he finds a postcard for Shell Beach, which triggers a bit of memory (accompanied by the movie's theme music...only played backward)... <br /> <br />Meanwhile, a detective on the police force who has taken over a serial killer case discovers a dead body in the very hotel room where Murdoch was staying. he takes it upon himself to track down Murdoch and find out what happened. <br /> <br />Lastly, a creepy doctor named William Schreiber is trying to find Murdoch to either manipulate him, or explain what's going on with him... <br /> <br />And throughout the movie, people change identities, a race called The Strangers menaces Murdoch and various characters, and it all leads to an ending, that, although a bit cheesy, you don't see coming, and one of the coolest fight scenes I've ever seen. The acting is great, Rufus Sewell especially, and the effects and set design evoke both creepy and beautiful images. <br /> <br />If you haven't yet seen this movie, you must be absolutely crazy. <br /> <br />Just remember: SKIP TO THE OPENING CREDITS.
B00005YUAC|4.0|I totally bought this album by word-of-mouth after reading about some dude in a guitar mag that liked it. He stated that it was progressive sounding and i like exploratory styles of music such as some of the yes albums and pink floyd and stuff so i bought it. What a great record! It totally reminds me of something that the dudes on that 70s show would be listening to in some dark basement sitting around an old elecrical spool! Really mellow, instrumentally driven album. It has some really wacky guitar licks in it and rhythm changes that remind me of the early yes albums such as \\"Close to the Edge\\" or \\"The Yes Album\\". I really dig \\"Mystic Queen\\", and \\"Slow Yourself Down\\" erupts out of nowhere into a pretty good rocker. Instrumental tracks like \\"Arubaluba\\" and \\"Six Ate\\" are almost hypnotic. A definite must have \\"chill out\\" record. I looked into other albums by Camel.. Moonmadness and Snow Goose seem pretty popular, but i've only listened to Moonmadness and found it a little to \\"experimental\\" for my taste. If this is your first taste of Camel, make this your #1 buy. It will blow you away.

0689865384|4.0|In Tally's world, you're born ugly. But that's all right, because when you turn sixteen you get a complete makeover, and you become pretty. And being pretty equals happiness. That's what Tally always thought, especially since her best friend Peris turned sixteen and left her for New Pretty Town.<br /><br />So Tally has three months to wait until she herself can join him. In the meantime she meets Shay, a rebel that has the same birthday as her. But Shay's not excited about getting the operation at the same time as Tally. She doesn't want it at all.<br /><br />Shay proves it when she runs away to the Smoke, a place where people can live how they want, without the pretty operation. Tally lets her go- but then she is blackmailed into bringing her back, and she learns that there's a dark side to her town, called Special Circumstances. And there's also a dark side to becoming pretty.<br /><br />Uglies is amaginzly imaginative science fiction, and Scott Westerfeld plays mercilessly on how much we judge by looks. He keeps his book reasonably well-paced, though there are points where he needed to go into description. Special Circumstances was \\"bad\\", that was nailed down. But why? What was up with those people?<br /><br />He also falls into a young adult literature trap- Tally's romance. Though Shay's reaction was classic, believable, and good, Tally's \\"love\\" is not typical teen, especially not for one that's willing to turn in her friend to become pretty. He seems to forget at some points that he's writing teenagers, not old married couples.<br /><br />I have yet to read \\"Pretties\\" and \\"Specials\\", the two sequels, so some of my criticism might be off. But I really did enjoy \\"Uglies\\". It's a good slap in the face to wake us up at how there are so much more important things than looks. There's something real about the world Westerfeld had created- at times you can even wonder if someday we'll actually be living in it.
B00007KMOX|5.0|Here is the return of one of classical music's most revered recordings in sound that makes it competitive with everything recorded today. I don't subscribe to the audiophile warning given elsewhere on this page, for this recording sounds every bit as good as 2005 first editions recorded with DSD technology.<br /><br />The current reissue is, for SACD, reproduced in five-channel SurroundSound with three distinct front channels and two rear surround channels. The sonic picture is at least 100 percent improved from the 30-year-old original with the greatest improvement in the mid ranges affecting timpani, bassoon and other lower instruments. The mid range improvement also helps the Vienna Philharmonic horns sound even more glorious than they were on the stereo edition.<br /><br />Musically, this CD has been hailed as one of the greatest Beethoven recordings in history from the day it arrived in 1976. It is still one of the great recordings available of these two titanic symphonies and the sound improvement makes it a clear first choice for the Symphony No. 5. Many people were always put off by Kleinber's perhaps too direct approach to the Symphony No. 7 and nothing here will mute that criticism.<br /><br />If you want an upgrade in this music or just want to sample the marvel known as SACD, this recording fits the bill. The upgrade from the three decade old original is wonderful and all the original intensity of attack is maintained. Even if you are more interested in technology than musical content, there is no reason to hesitate.
0307277674|1.0|Disclaimer -- I haven't read the DiVinci Code. I have, however, read quite a bit about the claims it makes. The reason for the one star is that Mr. Brown CLAIMS the assertion on the first page of the book merely means that the mentioned documents exist. Except, of course, on those days when Mr. Brown CLAIMS the documents prove the outrageous assertions outlined in the book.<br /><br />I was reading the Bible last night and came across 2 Peter Chapter 2. It states that people are susceptible to people like Mr. Brown, someone with no credentials in theology and someone who has clearly amassed a forture through his false teaching, because they are \\"unstable\\". In Biblical lingo, this means they don't know the Word of God, they haven't spent time in the Word. What a shame for them, and for America. I pray for revival almost every night. To those truly looking for answers, turn to God not to the Book of the Month (or even Year) Club.<br /><br />God Bless You!
0393317552|5.0|I needn't write a great deal about the finer points covered in this book - that has been done already, and a television series has produced a short (but accurate) sketch of the work's primary themes. But if anyone wants to understand the story of how power came to be dispersed in this world, why some nations and peoples have and others do not, read this book.
B0002S64OG|5.0|My 15 month old loves this video.  When he first started watching around 6 months ago, I played the \\"basic\\" version for him all the time -- and he never got tired of it.  Now that he's a bit older, he really likes the \\"advanced\\" version with the animations and additional educational songs/nursery rhymes.  Definitely recommend this video for longer term viewing.
B000E33VWW|5.0|In the first years of the past Century the figures of Mallarme, Verlaine and Baudelaire represented in France one step ahead in many fronts. They represented the anguish, the febrile despair and expressed with absolute conviction their sarcastic and dark opinions about the future to come. Those diviner voices have always resulted unpleasant for a the most of people, because they are considered something like the uninvited guest, the unblessed angels, the lucidity of the conscious in its most cruel nakedness.<br /><br />Truman Capote was one of these voices. His naturalness at the moment to express awful truths deserved to him the expected results. But he was not the only on. You should add this list names of the height of Sinclair Lewis, Faulkner, Steinbeck, Hemingway, Steinbeck, Alan Ginsberg and Kerouac.<br /><br />This film portraits with admirable crudeness, those years in which the phantoms that still nestled in the mind of many people and permeated behaviors and attitudes of intransigence and repression as natural response to the recent wounds of the WW2.<br /><br />You should notice a similar phenomena happened in Germany; two names are enough to prove it: Gunther Grass and Peter Handke.<br /><br />It would be worthy to remark the fact the 2006 Academy Awards turned around the past (Brokeback mountain, Good night and good luck, Capote and Munich) indicate a visible process of cathartic depuration and an obvious need to analyze the traces of a recent past to realize many hidden aspects of the collective unconscious.<br /><br />Philip Seymour Hoffman has given securely the role of his lifetime. Regarding he is a young and talented actor, something inside me tells me he reached that genius trait, this sublime peak achieved for others actors. For instance George C. Scott with Patton, Anthony Hopkins with The silence of the lambs, Clift Robertson with Charly, Ben Kingsley with Gandhi, Broderick Crawford with All the king's men, Peter O'Toole with Lawrence of Arabia, or Jack Nicholson with One flew over the cuckoo' s nest. That performance level in which you may state he achieved the state of art and more than an actor he became a model.<br /><br />An absolute modern classic.r the cuckoo' s nest.

B000002JOH|5.0|Sometimes I have tough days at work. There are days when my boss is all over me for not staying on top of the fries during lunch rush or I don't pick up everything in the parking lot or I'm sleeping with his girlfriend. After a stressful day like those nothing is more soothing than drawing a bath, grabbing the latest issue of Cat Fancy and throwing on Vulgar Display of Power by Pantera. I'm wired pretty hot by nature, so I'm pretty much always on edge. That is life as the nook, you're always looking over your shoulder. I've dated tons of hot women and their ex-boyfriends don't seem to get the Nook vibe and want to beat me senseless. It doesn't do them much good as I've got Daniel Larusso martial arts skills to repel any would be attacker. Even though I layeth the smack down, it's still a little stressful. Nothing takes me to a happier place than a nice pantera album. The vocals are smooth, much like I would picture John Tesh sounding if he were hammered on Jager and someone kicked him in the twins. I'll usually sip a Pepperjack martini and read all about what is going on in the world of cats. Most Pantera fans are cat lovers, I don't know why that is, but it is pretty much a given. <br /> <br />What's my favorite song? Thanks for asking. I would have to go with Live in a Hole. It takes me back to when I was 15 and I dug a hole under our mobile home that I lived in for two weeks. I would bring dates down there and we would cook mac and cheese over the fire. It was truly a wonderful time. I felt like a warrior in the army of the republic. So if you want to just kick the shoes off after a long day of whatever you do get some pantera and relax.
B000084T18|1.0|\\"Get rich or die trying\\"  Wow, I mean what a powerful message to our youth.  I never thought it could be articulated so well.  That if you cant be rich, you are worthless and you might as well steal, murder, and rape to become rich.  If you get put in jail or killed, who cares right!?!?! You tried baby!  But hey, 50 Cent grabs his crotch excessively...he must be cool. 0 stars.
B000BKDOB6|5.0|I've already reviewed the earlier version of Horses so no cheap recap. I was at BAM in NYC November 2005 to celebrate the 30th year. Was struck by the generational cross section & diversity -parents with teen children (maybe 'Boomers with grandkids, certainly Gen X & offspring,) twentysomethings, lesbians who cherish the message in \\"Gloria,\\" curiosity seekers, the tragically hip who missed it on the first (or several)go-rounds. That we're even writing about an album thirty years old speaks to its importance. Can I quibble about the new version of \\"Land\\"? Sure. Do I care? No. When I first heard some of these songs 30+ years ago they had completely different lyrics entirely (like \\"Birdland\\" - which started with Patti's poem \\"bar stools were made for women like this...\\") Patti was, and is, not one to take the safe road. Other than having to put on reading glasses to read her poetry (I sympathize - sucks doesn't it?) she is still a most vital force. If you don't own \\"Horses,\\" what are you waiting for? If you do, buy this version for the 2005 version live. Long may she Wave.
B000000H5K|3.0|Lets start with that at least this beats the hell out of Soulfly and the Derek Green c rap But it's not as good as old Sepultura. A lot of bands who have a long career somewhere there they sell out (i.e. In Flames, Children of Bodom, Judas Priest, Megadeth and *cough* Metallica *cough*). Although this is still decent.    Putting on guest musicians was completely pointless (especially Jonathan Davis). It could be better if the guitars were in proper tuning. Max' vocals sometimes sound over-tired here and it's kinda annoying. Other than that it is quite good. The guitars are decent and so are the solos (Andreas Kisser was never that amazing, I expected him to be better according to some reviews). 'Roots Bloody Roots' is a fierce opener and probably the best on the album. 'Dictatorsh*t' is a gfood closer. 'Attitude' and 'Endangered Species' are also good. The rest rail between fair to [bad] ('Ambush' is one of the worst Sep songs I've ever heard).    In short, it has some excellent moments, but when it's bad, then it's bad. Old-school thrash/death metal fans would may be turned off by this one. So if you're new go get Beneath the Remains, Arise or Chaos AD.
0553573403|5.0|Martin is a stud.  I like both him and Jordan immensly, but right now Jordan is bogged down in an unending plot where nothing is happening (also hope he is doing well with his treatment at Mayo).  I can't say much that hasn't been said but Martin is unpredictable and vivid.  His writing will suck any reader in.  He might be too brutal for some and may wack too many main characters for others but to me it makes the story more realistic.  Minimal magic, which I like better, and only used for important plot points.  Great book and awesome series.
B000AMWIVM|5.0|Saw with Cary Elwes and co-writer Leigh Whannell is so good, so creative, and so brilliant. I thought this movie was gonna be stupid but to my surprise it's probably the most strongest horror film I have seen since Scream. The camera tricks are cool and modern, the film has this great dark green color to it, as it does in the sequel Saw II (just as good as the orginial). Yes this film is gory and bloody but it works to the point where the film is not unbearable to view. Make sure you watch for all the clues, Saw is the perfect horror flick, highly recommend it!
B000F3AAUW|5.0|Danger Mouse is turning everything he touches into gold. He helped MF Doom make the jump from underground enigma to mainstream untouchable; now he's doing the same much-needed justice to Cee-Lo Green. While most MC/producer collaborations of late have come off as mere celebrity tag-teams matches, this album is genuine innovation. Hip hop heads can feel the Grey Album-style beats, complete with Mouse's trademark chopped-up kicks and snares and obscure Lalo Shifrin soul loops, while Cee Lo lays down some beautiful vocals reminiscent of both his better solo work and his classic contribution to Outkast's classic 'Aquemini'.<br /><br />Much in similar spirit to Mouse's collab with MF Doom you have an array of bizarre samples complimented by even more bizarre lyrics. The oddity of this album is, however, by no means alienating to the listener. In fact there is something for everyone on this album, as it is writhe with musical fusion from start to finish. Tracks like 'Go-Go Gadget Gospel' and 'Transformer' pays tribute to Cee Lo's dirty south roots with high-energy horn samples and fast-paced MPC drum loops. 'Crazy' (the single) and 'Smiley Faces' are modern adaptations of that early soul sound; Cee Lo wails like the love child of Al Green and Otis Redding and Danger Mouse samples catchy bass riffs, strings and gospel harmonies. 'St. Elsewhere', 'Feng Shui', 'Who Cares?' and 'Online' channel Portishead and Massive Attack with loungey vocals, soulful breaks and deep basslines - very much similar grooves to that on the Doom/Mouse album. Danger Mouse is at his most recognizable on 'Just A Thought' and 'Storm Coming', with the kind of chopped-up sampling off The Grey Album.<br /><br />'Gone Daddy Gone' is probably the weakest link on the album but it's still better than half the garbage of there that's blowing up. I like the bassline but the lyrics are grating and the beat is just a little too popcorn for my taste. That, and 'Necromancer' is just straight weird. Other than that this entire album is a great listen; it's a rare luxury to be able to listen to a complete album without having to keep the skip button close by. I think it's safe to say that Danger Mouse can finally shake the flack he's been getting for blowing up off of someone else's work (ie Jigga), and it's great to see Cee Lo getting out there and proving that Goodie Mobb are indeed a lesser group without him. Let's hope this album gets the appreciation it deserves.n that this entire album is a great listen; it's a rare luxury to be able to listen to a complete album without having to keep the skip button close by.

B000E8QVWY|5.0|A breakthrough of history and music down the hard and dirty journey of the original Johnny Cash. It enlightens you of how he got his start, what famous people he hung around with, what torments he had to suffer, and what he had to offer the world . . .a new sound.<br /><br />Jaquin Phoenix does a remarkable job in filling the big shoes of the rock legend. He's so convincing that, at times, I had to remember that he was an actor and not the real Johnny Cash. But, I would say that Jaquin Phoenix deserves an award for completely giving you the natural performance of Johnny Cash's life and memoirs. This movie made me fall in love with Bio-pics all over again.<br /><br />Reese witherspoon, in a depature from her regular movies, plays a convincing June Carter who is slightly interested in the mysterious, yet humble, sometimes crazy confident Johnny Cash.<br /><br />This movie is definetley for those who want to relive what it was like in the 1950's - 1960's when the dawn of a new sound in music emerged and said, \\"Hello, I'm Johnny Cash.\\"<br /><br />It's a really great movie. A definite \\"must have.\\"<br /><br />This movie makes the legend of Johnny Cash come alive!!!

0380788624|5.0|I'm a huge Stephenson fan going back to Snowcrash and The Diamond Age, Stephenson enters a whole new genre with Cyptonomicon but does not disappoint.  This is a great story that crosses multiple generations, Stephenson does a great job of painting a broad complex story while still taking time to delve into small details.  The best thing I can say about this book is that I've just purchased my 5th copy many of which have been given away to friends.
B000005IRG|5.0|I went to CBGBs in the mid-70s and saw a lot of the bands who became famous. The drinking age was 18 and the place was a dive on skid row, but it was cheap and had live music. As a then BTO and Deep Purple fan, I wasn't cool enough to appreciate Television, the Ramones or the Talking Heads who I especially hated. Blondie got a pass for being so hot. Still, I bought the first Ramones album and Marquee Moon around late '76 or early '77. Wanted to love the Television album, but I kinda' hated it. They mighta' had a punk aura, but the sound was nothing like the distortion driven guitars of the Ramones, Sex Pistols or modern punk sound bands like Nirvana or Green Day. <br /> <br />I rediscovered Television in the late 80s and now it's one of my all-time favorites. You gotta' listen to it a lot of times, let it grow on you. You can't just play it in the background either. You have to actually pay attention. It's artistic, melancholic, yes even angst-ridden. There's real beauty in the soaring guitar solos (guitar solos are so not punk) that intertwine to create a dynamic and unique fabric of music. I unfortunately could get past the sharp, twangy, almost country-ish Telecaster sound. I don't want to sound like a know-it-all saying you have to develop a taste for this album, but it did take me a long time to develop my own taste enough to appreciate this music. This album deserves another chance, for those who disliked it. Based on my own experience, it may even require several more chances. <br /> <br />BTW, I don't agree that \\"The Who\\" were godfathers of punk, as someone suggested. They had been street punks, but so was Rod Stewart, whose punk credentials don't need to be reviewed. For real precursors, try Bowie's Ziggy Stardust, B side. Of course there's the Dolls, the MC5s, Iggy the Stooges and the rest. Don't forget the Dictators! <br /> <br />One last thing: For those who question their musicality or technical chops, Television, believe it or not, was probably a collection of the best musicians in that genre, back then. Most of the other bands barely knew how to hold their instruments, let alone how to play them. Gigs at CBGBs were often glorified garage band rehearsals where the members were learning how to play their instruments. They played wrong chords, wrong songs and even argued about on stage during shows. You had to look at it as performance art, `cuz music it wasn't. Of course, they were great performers.

015670160X|5.0|Orlando is a gender-bending-twisting-conflating biography in which the eponymous hero begins as an Elizabethan nobleman and ends, over 300 years later, as a liberated woman.<br /><br />There are many reasons to read a classic work of fiction, but to be totally honest, doing so is not always a purely enjoyable experience. Sometimes it is more like work, worth the effort, but not easy or even totally pleasurable.<br /><br />This book is simply a gas: a high speed, surrealistic excursion through four centuries of the role of women and men in English society, and Woolf's writing is in turn caustic, brilliant, lyrical, funny, transcendent and astonishing.<br /><br />If you are going to read one great work of 20th century literature, this should be on your short list.
0553212540|5.0|This is the version I read while first discovering the many talents of Oscar Wilde. Dorian Gray is captivating, though the actual storyline is not intricate. The descriptions are extraordinary and left me wondering why he hadn't written more novels? Very short, very effective. It is inconcievable to think that Wilde was denounced for this book being immoral as it is really quite moral, considering the consequences of Dorian's behaviour. (He once commented that there never was an immoral or moral book, simply badly written or well-written) For insight into Oscar Wilde's very colourful life, pick up a copy of Richard Elmann's biography; it is not a happy read but very readable nonetheless.
0688156819|5.0|A short review for a short book seems in order: here, Master of the Odd, Tim Burton, has created a small volume of poems in the style of childhood rhymes, depicting the bizarre and often tragic lives of various horribly or abnormally formed children.  You have a living voodoo doll, a robotic bastard child, a child born instead as a mummy, a half-oyster boy, and so on, all struggling through what could only be described as grotesque mockeries of human existence.  You sympathize with these individuals because the world so clearly does not, and feel badly for their seemingly inescapable suffering. <br /> <br />But the nasty, evil part of you enjoys it all the same. <br /> <br />Utterly unique and definitely worth a read.

1572814349|4.0|I have collected well over 100 tarot and oracular decks over the past 15 years and am an artist myself. I can first-hand appreciate the amount of work that goes into creating a tarot deck.  Ms. Black has succeeded in creating one of the most beautiful collage-based tarot decks out in the market today.  For fans of medieval tarot decks, the Golden Tarot is a must-have deck.<br /><br />In days of old before the advent of computers and graphics programs, collage was done by hand with the images being painstakingly cut out with scissors, then glued to a larger piece of paper in order to create a coherent whole.  Ms. Black states in her Introduction that as a child she amused herself for many hours creating collages the old-fashioned way, but that the Golden Tarot was created with the use of digital collage with each image consisting of at least 20 layers.  However, you would never know by examining this deck that it is a digital production.  Even the tiniest element of each image is sharp and clear.  Although personally I am not a fan of digitally created decks as the source method is usually quite obvious, I had no clue this deck was digital in origin until I took the time to read the Introduction, which was several weeks after constantly using the deck for my own readings.<br /><br />As for readings, this deck did not require any \\"seasoning\\" on my part prior to its initial use.  Normally, for those of you unfamiliar with the process, upon buying a tarot deck, it must first be cleansed of any energies it may have picked up during the production and shipping periods, and also cleared of energies it may have collected while sitting on a shelf in the store.  Once this is accomplished, then you season the deck by placing your own unique energies into it (done in a wide variety of ways) so the deck will work for you.  I was so enthralled with the images of the deck that I did a quick cleanse and began using it immediately.  Right out of the box the Golden Tarot gave accurate and insightful readings.<br /><br />Speaking of the box, this is one of those cool all-in-one all-inclusive packaging sets that I have grown to love as it makes storage of the cards and accompanying book hassle-free.  The Golden Tarot comes in a box only slightly larger than the cards themselves.  The box is heavy-duty reinforced cardboard with the exterior illustrated with three images from within the deck.  The box is meant to be stored upright with the lid lifting directly off the top end of the box exposing the gold-gilded cards and accompanying book within.<br /><br />The book is quite extensive and highly impressive.  Once again, Ms. Black has put forth a tremendous amount of effort in producing all aspects of her wonderful deck.  The book has 198 pages and is 4\\" X 2 \\" inches.  The book includes Ms. Black's Introduction, a 10-page section on tarot spreads, and then a thorough discussion of the Major and Minor Arcanum.  Each card is illustrated with a small black and white image.  The book concludes with a two extensive appendices noting the sources of every image element of every card.  That alone was a massive undertaking as Ms. Black first created the deck as a computer-image only deck and only much later did she have to go back in order to source all of her collage elements.  A bibliography is also included that focuses on further reading.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this deck highly enough. It is well suited to both beginner and advanced Readers alike.  Years from now I firmly believe the Golden Tarot will be viewed as one of the all-time classic tarot decks.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor.  Buy this deck.ccurate and insightful readings.  <br /> <br />Speaking of the box, this is one of those cool all-in-one all-inclusive packaging sets that I have grown to love as it makes storage of the cards and accompanying book hassle-free.

B000BW7QWW|5.0|I watched Serenity in the cinema without having seen Firefly. Very simply, Serenity is an outstanding Sci Fi film with a great storyline and laced throughout with wry and gritty humour. Characterisation is very good, indeed, and melds superbly with the aforementioned storyline and humour. Basically the characterisation depicts real people and this makes the difference.<br /><br />Serenity is also an example of the Sci Fi genre making relevant social comment but sadly this probably contributed to the cancellation of the tv series from which it is derived.<br /><br />Joss Whedon (the series creator) has made a space saga set 500 hundred years in the future. With undertones of the Old West, Mankind has been colonising other planets and moons. A bitter civil war between Separatists and the Alliance Government has recently finished, resulting in the victory of the Alliance. This government tends to interfere in every day life, is ultra politically correct, and seems to be in hock to mega corporations..... (Hmmm I wonder what the parody there could be?!!).<br /><br />Eking out an existence among the many worlds, is a survivor of the Separatist forces - Captain Mal Reynolds (played well by a wry Nathan Fillion). His command is an old spaceship called Serenity. Mal Reynolds and his crew smuggle and deal in contraband etc. They also take on passengers on a 'no questions asked' basis.<br /><br />Recent additions to the crew of the Serenity include a young doctor - Simon and his telepathic sister - River. Both are fleeing from the Alliance, and River was a test subject for drug research on psychics. This testing was carried out by the Alliance and the mega Corporations, and both want her returned swiftly. Hunting River and Simon, is an Alliance elite officer/assassin known as an operative. Superbly played by Chiwetel Ejiofor, he is a glacially calm, reflective, and totally ruthless individual, determined to catch River and Simon by any means possible.<br /><br />Apart from the Alliance, the crew of the Serenity have to face other dangers including the Reavers who are horrifically deformed space cannibals who hunt the cosmos, looking for victims to be eaten alive, dead not being to their taste (so to speak).<br /><br />Serenity is a brilliant film from start to finish and will keep the viewer wholly engrossed. I was surprised and delighted with how good it actually was, and went back for a repeat viewing at the cinema. I also bought the dvd when it came out, and again it makes for terrific viewing on the home cinema system. Sound and picture are both superb on an HDMI picture and multi channel sound.<br /><br />I also bought the dvd of the tv series Firefly and really enjoyed this too. In fact I am glad that I saw the film first because if I had seen the tv series first, then I might have had some unrealistic expectations for the film version. Like many other reviewers on here, I am amazed that the tv series was cancelled but there do appear to be a number of reasons for this, and I intend to look at these in more detail when I write my review of Firefly the tv series. The film, however, ties up many of the loose ends from the tv series.<br /><br />Good news for fans is that Whedon and Universal apparently have another two films of Serenity in the pipeline, and I for one cannot wait to see them.ew of the Serenity have to face other dangers including the Reavers who are horrifically deformed space cannibals who hunt the cosmos, looking for victims to be eaten alive, dead not being to their taste (so to speak). <br /> <br />Serenity is a brilliant film from start to finish and will keep the viewer wholly engrossed.

1400079179|2.0|I began reading The Da Vinci Code with the idea that it was a superb book, due to the comments of several co-workers.  The book, it seemed at first, was very good.  It was riveting and exciting, with so many questions to answer that I couldn't put it down.  Even the religious theories were very compelling.  However, it soon came to a sudden stop.  Dan Brown, in an attempt to keep things interesting while exerting as little effort as possible, starts to flail around blindly in his attempts to further unfold his theories.  If this were not enough, he causes his characters to take a disappointing dive into the depths of stupidity, having them stumped by amateur riddles and kindergarten clues in an attempt to drag out his nonsense.  The book is then wrapped up in a \\"ha ha! tricked you\\" manner that did not appease my anger at having wasted my time.  The book, on the whole, reminded me of the stories that I used to write in middle school...which is very sad.
B000002H97|1.0|I was just listening to this CD, and thought how dangerous this album is. I mean that singer, he just can't sing, this is just dirty, dangerous, loud, angry metal. I mean I like the drummer <br />Lars but the rest of the CD is just noisy. The only good song is <br />Enter Sandman. I like Nirvana Nevermind better because Kurt Cobain is much better singer even though he screams some. I think <br />there were more songs I liked on that album such as Smells Like Teen Spirit, Come As You Are, and In Bloom. This is just stupid lousy album. Go get Nirvana Nevermind and any album from Dire Straits, Guns N' Roses, or Green Day insted.  <br /> <br />PS. This music is gonna make you cry.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|The best rock album in the last 20 years. Hands down. The best Chili Peppers album yet. If you dont like the band, dont review this album. People dont listen to the negative reviews on this website. Across the country this thing is already everyones shoo-in for album of the year at the Grammys. please. do yourself a favor...get this album.  <br /> <br />Highlights <br /> <br />Dani California - everyone has heard this by now. classic rock anthem <br /> <br />Snow (Hey oh) - super mellow and actually very beautiful. one of the best tracks in all. <br /> <br />Hump De Bump - classic Chili Peppers funk. awesome track <br /> <br />Slow Cheetah - very underrated. awesome acoustics and puts you in an incredibly somber funk. <br /> <br />Torture Me - loud, blasting, four snare beat with even a hint of a trumpet at the end. Johns solo kicks ass <br /> <br />C'mon Girl - starts out like a ballad but blasts off during the chorus. another great John solo.  <br /> <br />Hey - jazzy brilliance. one of the top tracks in my opinion. johns solo is so slow and methodic that its amazing.  <br /> <br />Desecration Smile - another track like Slow Cheetah. you'll get the chills when the piano comes in <br /> <br />Tell Me Baby - once again another classic Chili Peppers sound. they switch from funk to rock better than anyone ever has. great rapping lyrics <br /> <br />Hard to Concentrate - quiet and passionate. just an all around really cool track <br /> <br />Readymade - the part of the song where Anthony tells John to \\"clean it up\\" will sell you on this track. friggen kick ass.  <br /> <br />Make You Feel Better - probably will be a single. great drum beats. reminds me of the 60s brit rock.  <br /> <br />Storm In A Teacup - awesome guitar lick in the intro to the verses. hearing a muffled anthony scream \\"somebody get down here now!\\" in the begginning is awesome. rocked out track.  <br /> <br />We Believe - i dont know why i love this track so much but i just do. i didnt at first but its really grown on me. the childrens chorus brings back an \\"under the bridge\\" feel. cool and jazzy like Hey.  <br /> <br />Turn It Again - could be the best track on the entire album. absolutely amazing solo, chorus, lyrics. everything about it is incredible. <br /> <br />Death of a Martian - haunting closing track to a superb album. the spoken prose at the end is modern day poetry.  <br /> <br />All in all, this album is genius. dont listen to the crappy reviews that say people will forget about this because they are wrong. This album will be considered rock royalty for years to come.
B000BM6AVA|5.0|I say this to justify my perspective on this band. <br /> <br />I grew up on \\"hard rock\\" (before metal), went through prog, punk, new wave, alternative, and everything in between.  I always dreamed of a band that had the crunch of metal, the lyrical smarts of punk, and the musical ambitions of progressive music.  System of a Down is the culmination of those dreams.   <br /> <br />\\"Toxicity\\" is my favorite hard rock album ever.  And System of a Down is easily one of the five or ten greatest live bands that I've ever seen--and I've seen a lot of great bands.  They're the most important band making music today--better than Radiohead, U2, or any other pretender, if you ask me.  They are Hall of Fame material, if by then there is any justice regarding selection. <br /> <br />Anyway, \\"Hypnotize\\" isn't quite as good as \\"Toxicity\\", but it's better than \\"Mesmerize\\", with greater lyrical depth, fabulous songs, impressive musicianship, and terrific vocal harmonies.  I'm not going to dispute the fact that Serj's vocals are better than Daron's, but their tandem vocals complement each other well, adding a musical wrinkle they didn't have on \\"Toxicity\\".  A couple of songs near the end tend to flag, but the album ends with a bang, and the first two-thirds of the album is flat out awesome if you ask me.  I would say it's SOAD's second best album, which only makes it one of the best damn CDs ever made.   <br /> <br />Did I mention I'm 51 #&@$ing years old?
0553801503|1.0|I loved the first three books in this series.  I could not wait for Feast of Crows to come out.  After the first 50 pages, and nodding off several times I knew something was wrong.  Simple put, it was boring.  The author seems to have lost his voice and intensity.  The characters lacked action, interest and engagement.  They were flat and the plot wandered around aimlessly.  I forced myself to finish when I realized there was another book coming out.  Also, I was hoping that it would pick up.<br /><br /> Save yourself some cash borrow it from the library or just skip it and go with Dance of the Dragons.<br /><br />Oh, I don't buy blaming the publisher.  The author needs to control how his material is released and this book stands on its own merit not what it could have been or how it is related to the next book.
0312335164|1.0|If I had read this before the DaVinci Code I wouldn't have read that good thriller.  A formula rag.
B000BM6AVA|2.0|I really like this band; their first record blew me away back in 1998, and Toxicity is one of the best rock records of the '00s. \\"Steal this Record\\" may be outtakes, but contains some of their finest material. Mezmerize is a strong record, with heavy grooves and memorable hooks.  One thing I noticed between Toxicity and Steal this Record is Daron Malakian's vocals began to take a more prominent role.  On Mezmerize, he is in essencethe co-lead singer.  I think this is a hinderance to their music.  His voice is simply grating to my ears.  Compare Mezmerize to Toxicity, and Serj is really pushed to the sidelines on the new records.  This is a shame.  However, the material itself on Mezmerize, as I've said, is strong and holds up despite Malakian's annoying whine.   <br /> <br />Hypnotize, however, is a mess.  I've tried listening to it twice, to no avail.  No memorable hooks, the vocal lines dominated by Daron's excruciating yelp.  Their weirdness has now become histrionic.  And finally, the mastering.  I'm sure the mix by Andy Wallace is top notch, as is always the case with him.  But, this thing is mastered so LOUDly that it's rendered mush.  I've never heard a record so loud, and I mean that in a bad way.  The peak limit is shoved all the way to the top, all dynamic range is crushed, all peaks are clipped, resulting in a very, very harsh sound.  This is a not a good CD.  This is the model for how NOT to master a CD.  This is the latest in the loudness wars, the race to release the \\"hottest\\" CD.   <br /> <br />I'm sorry to say that I don't like this record.
B000000P17|4.0|The Spaghetti Incident was to be the final release of the now classic lineup of Guns and Roses.  Instead of going out with a bang, the band went out with a whimper caused by fighting and egos within the band. <br /> <br />That said, this album isn't entirely bad.  The band picked some of their favorite punk (and one or two non-punk) classics and put their spin on them.  The video for \\"Since You've Been Gone\\" got a fair amount of airplay and video time back when it came out.   <br /> <br />If you're a fan of GNR and are curious where their roots come from, then by all means pick this up.  If you're a casual fan looking for the hits, then move on.  There's nothing to see here.
B000003TA4|2.0|NIRVANA are amongst one of the most overrated groups of all time after Green Day.They only made one decent song in Smells like teen spirit.Their other albums and songs are pure drivel and junk.DONT BUY THIS TERRIBLE ALBUM.Get TEN from PEARL JAM instead.
B00000IFP6|5.0|I love this set.<br /><br />Brisk tempi, good detailed sound, fine orchestral playing, lean and transparent, but powerful etc.<br /><br />However: I must confess that the performances lack something:<br /><br />If you listen to the 3rd symphony, without ever heard the rest of Zinman's performances, you'll pretty much get an idea of what the 5th or 7th is gonna sound like...it's a matter of how you look at things: you could say Zinman is consistent in his interpretations or you could say his performances lack character, a personal touch, everything is handled the same way.<br /><br />For me his choice of tempi are spot on, I agree with them and the orchestral playing is refined without being too polished...although sometimes I wished it to be a bit rougher, like Savall in Beethovens 3rd for instance.<br /><br />The 3rd is given an excellent performance, but in comparison with Savall without an edge and maybe \\"heart\\".<br /><br />In Savalls 3rd you'll hear an involvement with the music, kinda as if Savall never heard Beethovens 3rd in his life before and is now obsessed with the music, there's so much tension, spirit and involvement in his reading.<br /><br />Zinman plays it how it should be played, but nothing more...<br /><br />The 7th is excellent, but there's a lack of lower strings and bass.<br /><br />etc etc.<br /><br />Overall this set is really very very good, for me these recordings are my (personal) reference performances..but not necessarily my favorite performances of each individual symphony.
0440419514|4.0|In trying to figure out why these three volumes were such a letdown for me, I noted the following: the books are well-plotted, with continuous action and excitement, and a large cast of colorful characters, and yet... to continue with the theatrical language... some major roles are completely mis-cast.<br /><br />I can't buy the characterizations of Lyra and her mother at all.  They alone, of all the individuals we see throughout the three books, never come to any kind of convincing life.  Tolkien knew he couldn't do a convincing female character, so in his LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy, there are no important female characters.  The hollowness of Lyra and Mrs. Coulter results in a corresponding nearly-fatal hollowness in much of the book's action, particulary in the final half of AMBER SPYGLASS.<br /><br />The other problem is, of course, the main villain Metatron. Here's an all-powerful character who ruthlessly rules many universes, and effortlessly outthinks humans, yet he is unable to do anything effective to thwart the plans of Lord Asriel, and he is decoyed to his death by a preposterously transparent  ploy that wouldn't fool a tiny child.  With Metatron so easily disposed of, the completely emotionally unconvincing love story that infests the last half of AMBER SPYGLASS is something the reader must simply endure to get to the last page.<br /><br />Among the trilogy's many positive points are a delightful use of the mythologies of Milton and William Blake, a terrifying depiction of the afterlife, some sexy and charismatic witches, a Clint Eastwood/Man With No Name clone who pilots balloons for a living, and the Panzer Bears.<br /><br />Those looking for Tolkien-style giant battles will be disappointed.  If you are a lover of epic fantasy, this is well worth your time, but it is far from being consistently well-done.
0761944524|5.0|It is very clear. <br />You can make sure what you are doing. <br />Its coverage is great. <br />Thanks Andy
0634060384|4.0|This \\"Real Book 6th\\" edition is going to be the new standard. \\"The Real Book 5th edition\\" is difficult to find and it costs more than the legal version. Even though the song selection is very similar, it is different. The purpose of this is to replace all the 5th edition real books; it is not here to replicate it. The reason I give this four stars is because gigging musicians who need to replace a worn out 5th edition cannot go to this book as a replacement. (Even though most gigging musicians should know someone who sells the 5th edition)
1400079179|3.0|Brown managed at the perfect time to publish the perfect best-seller.<br /><br />Of course, it's not fact; make no mistake on that (and go ahead and watch a few of the many documentaries this book has sparked for some interesting history).  What it is, however, is a clever adventure and mystery story that pulls in select snippets of conspiracy theory worthy of late-night radio, biblical lore, history, and the art and somewhat fictionalised personal history of Leonardo DaVinci.<br /><br />Brown has managed to pull these things together in a way that is not only palatable, but enjoyable, and something that is almost believable by mass audiences.  This is not to say that Dan Brown is trying to pull the wool over anyone's eyes.  He tried, and succeeded, in writing a book that has made him rich beyond what any author can reasonably expect to gain on a work of fiction.  That is genius, even if the history, codes, and theories hold water for about as long as a tissue-paper bowl... just long enough to get through the story.<br /><br />The story itself is well plotted and put together.  At times it does venture into almost preachy as it is explaining histories and theories involved with the Holy Grail, and those sections I found to be a bit slow as compared to the pace of the book overall.  I also found in this section that my suspension of disbelief was interrupted, as religious history is a subject I enjoy learning about, even if it is on a very amateur level, and I found the leaps of logic a bit too far here... but for those who haven't made a study of religious history, this shouldn't interfere with the enjoyment of the book.<br /><br />Some I know have expressed disappointment in The DaVinci Code, and I can understand that.  With all the hype and controversy, one could easily expect the next great work of literature when they pick it up off the shelf.  However, Dan Brown is not Tolstoy, and The DaVinci Code is not great literature.  Not that it's bad as a thriller mystery novel; it is certainly catchy, and I read it with fervor.  Each location was described with just the right balance, the characters were just deep enough to move the fast plot forward, the tension was mostly very good, and the entire book is one which I think will translate well onto the silver screen.<br /><br />So, if you've not yet read the DaVinci code, go ahead and check your disbelief at the front cover and sit down for an engaging read... just don't forget to pick your disbelief back up at the finish.  And once you're finished, the puzzles and codes within the book as well as on the web are a challenging exercise.riller mystery novel; it is certainly catchy, and I read it with fervor.

076790592X|3.0|the book was easy to read.  the book was about a man who lived, got a disease, and died.  i know i may sound cold hearted but the book did not touch my heart as it did alot of others who read it.
0757302661|5.0|I loved the new edition of the book.  After giving birth to my son in 2003 using HypnoBirthing I was thrilled that the new edition was out just in time for the birth of my daughter in August 2005. After a second successful HypnoBirth I'm hooked! <br /> <br />I now give this book/CD to all of my newly pregnant friends.  With or without the class, this is an important read for every woman preparing for childbirth.  I like that it comes with the CD. <br /> <br />This book provides useful tools that can be adapted to your own labor and delivery.  The methods helped me throughout the birthing process.
0689859368|4.0|Book:<br /><br />This is the first book of the Spiderwick Chronicles, so that generally means it's a introduction book to those that will follow it.<br /><br />It begins with you learning about the Grace family and why they have moved, it seems that Jared, is a problem child.<br /><br />Living in the new house they are soon attacked by a series of weird events that, of course, are blamed on Jared. Determined he isn't the one behind it he and his siblings get mixed up in a journey to discover what is around them.<br /><br />----<br /><br />My opinion:<br /><br />This book was fairly good, not much really happens in it but, you still need to read it to understand the rest of the series.<br /><br />As you read on you long to know what kind of creatures could be walking about your feet...and so I definately recomend you read this book.
B00005B58Y|5.0|I love this album.  The first Miles Davis I ever heard was Kind of Blue.  But I actually heard \\"Milestones\\" on a Buddy Rich tribute CD that had been organized by Neil Peart of Rush.  Billy Cobham (of John McLaughlin's Mahavishnu Orchestra) played drums with Buddy Rich's band and they'd done a fantastic cover of this song.  This inspired me to seek out the album, and am I ever glad I did. <br /> <br />As one other reviewer said here, as brilliant as Kind of Blue is, it can meander somewhat.  I think Milestones is more succinct and to the point.  While all the songs are great (understatement of the year), and musicianship on the entire album is second to none, I do have some favourites.  Obviously, \\"Milestones\\" is at the top.  As much as I liked Miles' work with a Harmon mute, I loved the tone he got from his straight trumpet.  The soloing is great, but the rhythm section is really the glue that holds this song together.   <br /> <br />And speaking of the rhythm section, \\"Billy Boy\\" has to be my other favourite.  Philly Joe's transition from brushes to sticks is smooth as glass, and I love that Paul Chambers plays his bass solo with a bow.  Unique.  You can definitely see how the foundation was laid for later rhythm sections such as the fantastic Herbie Hancock/Ron Carter/Tony Williams team. <br /> <br />Do yourself a favour and grab this album.
B00006JKOL|4.0|I had to give this one 4 stars simply because a band with over 20 recordings can't have all 5 stars. This one slips just outside of the top 5 recordings.  <br /> <br />I agree with comments that the original was better and the bonus tracks on all the Tull remasters should be scrapped. There just was no need for them, as that is why they released Nightcap. If you couldn't make this album crank in its original format, you need a better stereo. I will agree the remastering did clean it up a bit but I prefer the original for its ambient quality. I've always considered that Tull albums were perfectly balanced as is, extra tracks ruin the feel of the album. I would suggest trying to find an original for prefrence. <br /> <br />The title track is still one of my favorite Tull tracks and would be worth it for this alone. Other highlights are Baker St Muse and One White Duck. Martin Barre (guitar) does some of his finest work on this album. <br /> <br />Like all Tull albums I admit I find it hard to fault any one of them. They are the type of group if you have one you should have them all and I do. The trap for young players is that Tull change direction every 2 or 3 albums as is they're want. If you're looking for Aqualung, Songs from, or Thick as, you won't get it here. Take each Tull album as a stand alone masterpiece and don't make the mistake of many \\"fans\\" of comparing one to another.
B000001FI7|3.0|... remember that dreaded videotape in the horror movie \\"THE RING\\"? this creepy recording would have to be the closest thing I've ever heard to being its audio counterpart - like background music from a David Lynch horror show... that's not to say that it doesn't possess a certain dark beauty about it - I'd just be very wary of anyone who listens to it a little too often, especially emotionally unstable melancholic types... Beth Gibbons' torturous vocal stylings are disturbingly effective at evoking a haunting, ghostly atmosphere of gloom and deep despair... should come with a disclaimer that this CD is not suitable listening for those teetering on the verge of a nervous breakdown.
B00005JMJG|5.0|One night i decided to watch this on hbo and i really loved it.
B000E6UK5K|5.0|Pink Floyd's guitarist and vocalist David Gilmour's new solo album On an Island is thus far the best album released this year so far.<br /><br />This is Gilmour's first new recordings since the 1994 Pink Floyd studio effort The Division Bell and his first solo album since 1984's About Face.<br /><br />The album was co-produced by Gilmour, Roxy Music guitarist Phil Manzanera and Chris Thomas and this album's musical styles run from Floydish sounding tunes to jazzy to blues, it has it all.<br /><br />Castellorizon is an awesome instrumental and what a way to start the album. I kind of subtitle it Let's Get Metaphysical Part 2 with DG's Strat duetting superbly with an orchestra about almost 2 minutes into the instrumental. We then segue into the title cut to On an Island. It is an awesome song and is already a masterpiece which would not have sounded out of place on a Pink Floyd record with Gilmour harmonizing with 66% of Crosby Stills and Nash being David Crosby and Graham Nash's superb harmonizing. Also, the guitar solos on this track of course are amazing. The Blue follows and is amazing with DG and fellow Floyd member keyboardist Rick Wright harmonizing on vocals very well. Gilmour's whammy pedal solos at the end of the track are amazing and cry shades of Marooned. Take a Breath follows and musically reminds me of Coming Back to Life and is a great song though some will scoff at it and has Gilmour pulling out the stops on both lap steel and Stratocaster. Red Sky at Night is an awesome instrumental and David kicks ass on sax showing he can play any instrument and he also does guitar effects here.<br /><br />This Heaven follows and is a great jazzy shuffle and shows David can play any genre of music(as he had proven on his David Gilmour in Concert DVD when he sang an excerpt of a French Opera in French and also a version of the lullaby Hushabye Mountain). Then I Close My Eyes is a great instrumental in a different sort of tone, kind of reminds me of Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast's second section but with some cumbus, glass harmonica and bass harmonica and Robert Wyatt's cornet added. Smile, I always liked this song, always have since Gilmour first performed it in 2001 and now sounds complete with David playing some great dobro on this track. A Pocketful of Stones is a nice ballad which is hard to put into words, arguably the best solo ballad Gilmour has recorded. Where We Start is a great way to end the album in a nice relaxing tone and cries shades of A Pillow of Winds from Meddle.<br /><br />On the versions that are initially sold at Best Buy, there is a bonus track of an almost 7 minute blues instrumental jam called Island Jam which is a great number.<br /><br />If you go into this album with expectations ala David Gilmour's 1978 album or a Pink Floyd album then you will be slightly disappointed but if you are an unbiased fan and appreciate music, take a listen!<br /><br />Highly recommended!cond section but with some cumbus, glass harmonica and bass harmonica and Robert Wyatt's cornet added.

0385504209|2.0|I am not a religious person, so the religious content of this book did not offend me in the least. I am more appalled at the poor writing. The prose is clunky. The characters are bland. The situations they find themselves in are corny. And even I figured out the first anagram in 30 seconds...and anagrams are certainly not my strong suit.<br /><br />While I can certainly see the appeal in this breezy read, I can't understand the excitement. A whole week of specials devoted to it on National Geographic? Please.<br /><br />Do yourself a favour, borrow this from a library if you must, but don't waste your money on something you'll finish in a day and forget about in a week. Try doing some research on your own, you'll find it much more enjoyable.
B00070DK14|5.0|This album is superb. My favorite Tull album and I have them all. The mistake most reviwers make is that they COMPARE. Tull are one of my favorite band because they change track so often you never know what you're going to get. NO this is not Aqualung or Thick as or Songs from etc etc. It is Broadsword and The Beast and that's what it's meant to be, all by itself. <br /> <br />Once again if you thought the original was muddy you need to get a better stereo. As with ALL Tull remasters they've added the dreaded extra tracks (WHY WHY WHY????!!!!) that destroy the feel of the originals.  <br /> <br />Get the album buy hook or crook but try for the original first.
B0002YCVXI|5.0|Ennio Morricone is a master of many styles.  Yo-Yo Ma is a master of Ennio on the Cello.  The combination is outstanding.  Fire up L'Estasi Dell'Oro (Track 12) and it will transport you there.  How does he do that?  I don't have any idea but it surely moves me.    Thanks, Steve Willie, Olympia, WA
B000EULJLU|3.0|I'm not a diehard tool fan; however, after listening to the album all this album all the way through, I found that only songs 1, 2, and 5 are memorable listens.   <br /> <br />Vicarious - Great song, no doubt about it.  The best part of the song has got to be when the rythmic chugging comes along with Maynard's whipsering vocals circa the 3-4 min mark.  Followed by more rhytmic/head-bangin' type chuggin.  A solid track, and there is no doubt in my mind that it was a good idea to make this the single. <br /> <br />Jambi - the first time I heard this song, I was fascinated with the intricate riff in the beginning.  This is arguably the bets song on the album.  Again, the rhymic chugging comes into play.  I'm a vocalist myself, and I definitely appreciate when Maynard ends one of his vocal lines with a natural (in music terms) note that adds a twist and a pleasing overall effect to the listener.  Great song...one of the few moments on the album that lets Maynard's higher range shine. <br /> <br />Track #5 - It is both interesting and confusing as first how Maynard begins this song with a rather Maroon 5 vocal style, almost feminine aspect to his voice.  But once the bass rythym comes in, it makes more sense and is rather a cool listen.   <br /> <br />The reviewer below me seems to frown upon melody in songs.  Last time I checked, melody is what makes a song.  Otherwise, it's just noise.  Don't get me wrong, I'm definitely a fan of older Pantera, but only because Phil used vocals that were simultaneously aggresive but also carried a pitch instead of being monotone.   <br /> <br />I agree with the reviewer below me though that the rest of the album does appear (at first listen) to be filler material.  But that's Tool for you...it takes a while usually to swallow and get familiarized with some of their songs. <br /> <br />Hence, I rated this album a 3/5 since I believe they could have done a better job, granted the fact they had 5 years between their last album.  But again, songs 1, 2, and 5 are solid tracks.  I'd download those songs...but I don't know if I'd buy this album.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|Well technically it is, if you include the best of Jupiter and just take out a few on Mars (Mars is awesome), I think you've got something that tops Blood Sugar Sex Majick and One Hot Minute. I'm not a semi fan so I have all the CDS. This is truly a wonderful double disc and top 10 for the 00's. <br />'hard to concentrate' made me cry, probably cause I'm in love.
B00005JOVN|5.0|OK, so this movie is not great with plot of character, and it doesn't need to be.  For pure summer popcorn escapism, this movie will be hard to beat.
B00006JKOM|4.0|Once again this one just doesn't rate in Tull's top 5 albums, but having said that, it is remarkable for its stand alone quality (think Broadsword) in Tulls catalogue.  <br /> <br />This is the closest Tull ever came to mainstream R n R, and not really that close at that. It really is hard to fault this album at all and it will remain one of my favorites just for being what it is. Once again I will state NEVER COMPARE Tull albums and don't listen to those that do, you'll only be dissapointed and might miss a classic for your ears. <br /> <br />No doubt the remastering of this one was warranted, but once again the added tracks nearly destroy this masterpiece, it finishes forever with \\"The Chequered Flag\\" and that is how it should be. Find the original if you can.
0131103628|4.0|Authored by the guy who invented the C language and the first edition of the book being the known standard for C for over a decade, this book is one of those unique books that is a must read if you want to learn how to program. Early on in the book the authors say that this book is not for a beginner programmer, so if you are a newbie in programming please pick up a different book before diving into this one. This book is also refereed to as the K&R C and is the bible for the C programming language. The text has a simple structure as well as style from the beginning it follows the same ideas of Unix as well as the C language (they invented Unix as well as C). The author defiantly knows the language although I did notice that some of the ideas were not clearly presented on some occasions. All the programs in the book compile perfectly and there are questions asked pertaining to the chapter and section. One of the downsides with all the books I read on C so far is that they do not give you the complete answers to the questions. This one is no different as there is no answers to the questions asked in the book ( you could buy the The C Answer Book: Solutions to the Exercises in the C Programming Language to actually find the answers). One issue was that the book assumes too much as is not a tutorial style book as other books. The book is also not up to date with the standards (after all the 2nd edition was published in 1988 well before the C99) so a new edition must come sooner or latter. I have read the book 2 times and I am still sketchy on some of the ideas presented with this book. The book is 185 pages although so it is straight to the point, but maybe the authors traded the number of pages with the ability to explain things more clearly.
0385504209|5.0|I am not an avid reader and ususally do not read on a regular basis.  However, after picking up this book, it kept me glued to the pages until I finished.  One turn after the next, creating more suspense throughout the book.  I enjoyed this book and it has started my search to find other books like this to enjoy!
0345345061|4.0|Like said before, this book is for already established fans of J.R.R. Tolkien.  This book includes an essay about fairy stories and Tolkien's thoughts about what a fairy story is and is not.  It was a slow read, but interesting to see into his mind and to discover his influences.  The highlight of the book for me was the Farmer Giles of Ham.  It was a well told story.  The adventures of Tom Bombadil were good because it gives you some backstory of Tom.  I'm not really a fan of Tom Bombadil, but you can appreciate the thought that Tolkien put into Bombadils poetry/stories.  I really believe Bombadil was one of Tolkiens favorite characters.
B00005J6SZ|5.0|At this time, she still could not sing, but the production duties of Nile Rodgers proved otherwise.  She came out with a grunge look that captured every stupid girl looking like this child.  Madonna came back now as the Material Girl due to the first track.  The songs are good and catchy.  The only one I did not like however was the Miles Davis song \\"Love Don't Live Here Anymore\\".  Her attempt at jazz is abyssmal.  No range, emotion or class for that matter.  Every other song is slamming. <br />Get This!  Niles is the star here and unfortunately, that's sad. <br />Grade for album: A+++  Grade for singing: F!
1400032717|4.0|I think it was a good book that taught me ,someone with no experience or knowledge about autism, alot of things. It had a good charater ,Christopher, that you could sympathize with. Yet somethings ,such as the explicit language, that made the reading experience less enjoyable. I think that considering all things there are more pros than cons which in my opinion makes this good book to read.
0811828697|4.0|If you are a true Star Wars Fan,.. this book will blow your mind!!!!! It is a must buy!!!!  The information in this book about the creatures of the Star Wars Galaxy is amazning!!  This book is creative, inciteful, informative and entertaining!!!! I love it!!! The only downside is that this book doesn't include the creatures from Episode II and III.  I would've love to see what planets the Aklay, Reek and Nexu come from.  Either way,.. I strongly recommend purchasing this book!!!
B00000099Y|5.0|I was about 8 when Aenima came out.  I have it on tape.  At 8 years old, I was more into grunge.  But going through my old tapes, I found a couple albums by Tool that I just love.  Aenima is amazing.  A great follow-up to Undertow.  I only wish I could've seen them live.  Stinkfist is a great song that seems to be about an addictive sexual relationship.  That's my interpretation, anyway.  It's funny 'cause Maynard James Keenan has claimed that he's never had problems with vices/ addictions, but then how can he write so well about addictions?  Eulogy is excellent.  H. is excellent.  Even the interludes are great.  Aenema is definitely my favorite song off the album.  The intensity and the rage in MJK's voice will give you goosebumps.  Tool doesn't make the kind of music that you listen to.  Tool makes the kind of music you listen to, you can visualize, and you can feel in your blood.  They're in a genre all their own, and I will forever be a fan of theirs.

B00005J6T1|5.0|Maddona's first album is the total rage and being the rage is because she employed Reggie Lucas (Stephanie Mills fame), Jellybean Benitez and Mark Kamins to create a danceable album.  Every song is hot.  She came in 83 as a cutting dance artists from the group Breakfast Club.  Her voice back then was well under developed and she had not type of range.  Noticing that her singing was less to be desired, they focused more on her writing abilities and let her uninspired singing do it's thing.  If I ever told my fiance's girlfriend that her idol can't sing, she'll have an caniption and I pretty much don't care.  The songs are first rate: due to the fact that she wrote majority of the album, while Reggie wrote two which by the way made her a bonafide star: Physical Attraction and Borderline. <br />Borderline sounds almost like Stephanie's \\"Never Knew Love Like This Before\\".  Nevertheless, it's smoking.  What makes this album palpable is the fact that the background singers (which are black by the way) sound better than her.  Even though personally, she's more of a background singer than anything.  Employing the vocalese of late Gwen Guthrie (Ain't Nothing Goin' On But The Rent writer and singer), Norma Jean Wright (Chic lead singer), herself, Brenda White King (Stephanie Mills backing singer), Chrissy Faith, And Tina B to create sounds that would prove heavenly.  Sad to say that her singing isn't.  My faves are Physical Attraction, Holiday, Borderline, Lucky Star and Burnin' Up.  The entire album is good.  Cop Dis! Grade for album: A+, Singing: F
B000006TRV|5.0|The wall is my favourite albums after Who\\" next from The Who.It features my favorite song Comfortably numb which I could listen to a million times without being tired.If you like good music,I suggest you to buy this beauty rightaway.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Wow.  That's the word that came to mind when I first went through the album cover.  The artwork is amazing.  Supposedly, there is a puzzle to be figured out in the photos.  (This was said on Tool's official website.)  I have yet to figure the puzzle out.  If anyone gets it, let me know!  Now, onto the actual reviewing:  10,000 Days is a great album, but I expected more.  Call me crazy, but I figured this CD would out-do all its processors and it really didn't.  There were some early sounding Tool songs like Vicarious and Jambi (the first two tracks) which were really great.  My favorite songs were Wings For Marie, Pt. 1 and 10,000 Days (Wings, Pt. 2).  The rest of the album, however, doesn't really stand out.  Not that it's bad music, it's just different in that not each song is really memorable.  But, hey, it's Tool!  Anything by Tool is great and that's why I give it five stars.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Tool is in my opinion the best band of all time. Not just MY personal favorite, but based on their extraordinary musical talents: instrumental, lyrical, and musical. Tool's music has meaning. Significant meaning. But it takes some effort to analyze and thats the best part! MJK is a lyrical genius... the whole band is filled with musical geniuses. Tool rocks, thats what it all comes down to, and this album is par for the course. Personally I think Tool reached a musical plateau of sorts, where AEnima was right on the edge, Lateralus was as good as it (only a fraction better than AEnima, if at all), and 10,000 Days is comparable. Personally I think 10,000 Days is a little less powerful as a whole than Lateralus, in terms of lyrics and song meanings (as far as I can gather so far), but musically it is definitely on par for Tool (which is to say it is the best).  <br /> <br />Tool definitely evolves from album to album, with each having its own theme and character and style, while all maintaining the unique sound of Tool and their same power. Expect this album to be different from previous ones because it is. It is still the same Tool, only it is different just like say Lateralus is different than AEnima.  <br /> <br />Track by track: <br /> <br />1. Vicarious. 9/10  <br />2. Jambi. 10/10 <br />3. Wings pt1. 7/10 <br />4. 10,000 Days. 11/10 Long song but possibly Tool's best ever <br />5. The Pot. 10/10 awesome bass line <br />6. Lipan Conjuring (filler track)  <br />7. Lost Keys (filler) but cool  <br />8. Rosetta Stoned 9/10  <br />9. Intension 9/10 <br />10. Right in Two 10/10 <br /> <br />Overall Score: 10/10 <br />[compared to all other music, this album is for sure a perfect 10] <br /> <br />However, on the Tool scale, I will give it a 9.5/10 (I'd give Lateralus a 10/10 and AEnima a 9.5/10 and Undertow 8.9/10 for comparison)
B00005JOFO|4.0|I freely admit that I over analyze things, but I found the film to be more about Ennis Delmar's inability to connect with his feelings him than anything else. No matter what the gender, he detaches himself from those he loves. It isn't until the tragic lesson of the end of the film that Ennis realizes that he is emotionally destroying everyone around him.   <br /> <br />Ennis could be any man fearful of losing himself in the love of another: gay or straight.  He absorbs the love of others like an emotional vampire and then wrings the people who love him dry.  It is an amazingly artful depiction of a man completely divorced from--not devoid of--his emotions.   <br /> <br />Even his words are doled out drop by drop. Sparingly and rationed. He won't even raise his voice beyond a monotone so protective is he of their power. You get only so much and dare not ask for more.  It explodes the myth that the \\"strong silent type\\" is a desirable life partner.   <br /> <br />The film is a chronicle of the fallout from loving the emotional recluse that is Ennis Delmar.
B000E6UK5K|5.0|I love David Gilmour and all his three albums.I was always one of the biggest Pink Floyd fan but I looked their albums with Gilmour better than the one with Syd Barret.This album though a bit softer and melancholy,is still very good and makes for a great purchase.RECOMMENDED.
B000EULJLU|5.0|I have not stopped playing this cd, it is without dought the greatest cd of our time, a masterpiece.
B00006JMQG|5.0|Watching The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari is a surreal experience, one that you will not regret!!! A classic in every sense of the word. Furthermore, this DVD version is flawless, with 2 soundtrack options, and a host of special features. You can't go wrong.
0783228457|4.0|Very moody, somewhat psychadelic film concerning mind control via cable TV. A rougue cable station spell-binds its viewers who then do things they would not normally do. People have things in thier stomachs that you can't imagine. It has a dystopian flavor to it, and, as phantasamagorical as it is, it  commands your silent attention. It leaves an after-taste remeniscent of The Eyes of Laura Mars, and Blue Velvet. Only for people like me.
B00005JOEA|5.0|I dont really have a review, but i think the movie ROCKED MY SOCKS OFF. It was THE BEST movie i have seen in a long time I give it 2 thumbs up, 5 stars, 10 out of 10, perfect MUST see movie.
B000EMGAOY|4.0|Bye The Way was an interesting mix of tunes to say the least. The first track was by far the best as far as classic Peppers goes as it was funky and Rhythmic. The rest of the cd was basically straight ahead rock tunes. The cd was good, but not what I expected from these guys.<br /><br />Stadium Arcadium is a again a growing process for this band. It seems to be a little more funkier than Bye The Way, but it is not Mothers Milk or Blood Sugar Sex Magik. I guess the best way to describe is think Californication meets Bye The Way with a little bit of One Hot Minute tossed in but played a lot less aggressively. Let's face it, these guys have grown up and so has their music. Stadium Arcadium is a solid rock cd with lots of very good songs with some old style Peppers funk thrown in for good measure. Some people will hate the fact that these guys have calmed down somewhat and others will have grown with the band and enjoy what they hear. Most bands can't continue to simply churn out the same stuff year after year. Some bands have had success with that formula. AC/DC and Pantera come to mind, but for the most part, people and their out look on life change and so will their music eventually. Is it a good or bad thing?, well that depends on how you react to it. I think this release is one of their best in a few years and I'm happy to say that the Peppers are still strong and thriving after all these years.<br /><br />Stadium Arcadium is a very solid cd and well worth the price of admission.
B000F48CD8|4.0|This album maybe isn't as great as the White Stripes, but it sure is good.  There is only one song on the entire CD that isn't good (Call It A Day, which sounds more like a Benson than a White).  Steady As She Goes is an absolutely great rock song, and it is an impressive opener to the CD.<br /><br />The CD may not be quite as great as it was excepted to be, but it still is great.  It is my prediction that as these guys continue to work together, each CD will get better and better.  Broken Boy Soldiers is a great start for an excellent band.  Some of the best songs are Hands, Level, Blue Veins and Steady as She Goes (duh).  Intimate Secretary is quirky and fun, and Yellow Sun is just happy and a good song.<br /><br />You should buy this CD.  Mixing White and Benson and adding a couple of the Greenhornes is like putting peanut butter and jelly togther on a great piece of wheat bread.
0060930349|5.0|I had to read this for a US History class I took in college and when I received it, groaned at the size of the book.  But when I started reading it, I found that I really enjoyed it.  It gives more information than your average history textbook but enough to inspire you to do further research on topics contained within the book.  Its a big one - but very interesting so you won't mind that at all.  Like one of the other reviewers mentioned, I wish that I didn't have to stop and highlight and take notes as I was reading because this could be purely a \\"\\"leisurely\\" read if you are into history.
0375703861|2.0|While \\"White Teeth\\" is at times a funny and interesting novel, it is symptomatic of many such books and films about British ethnic minorities, for example \\"Bend it like Beckham\\".  While the hardships of serving up curry or running a corner shop might raise a few laughs first time round, to turn the observation of cliches regarding South Asians and Jamaicans in Britain into a fictional genre is a step too far. And this is what \\"White Teeth\\" is - not more than a catalogue of cliches regarding Bangladeshis and Jamaicans.  The characters are likeable but rather one-dimensional - why buy \\"White Teeth\\" when you could chat to a Jamaican or a Bangladeshi about their historical experiences ?
0689505698|2.0|This story definitely did not seem age appropriate.  This book is recommended for children ages 3-8.  Two of the pigs are eaten in the story, which can be disturbing to younger children.  The size of the text is enlarged during the times when the wolf is being `bad' or danger is being introduced.  That is a good way to allow the reader to raise his or her voice at these times while reading, but again, that can be scary for a child to hear.  The colors in the illustrations are a bit dull to set the mood of the sad, scary story in my opinion.  The plot is alright and somewhat easy to understand and follow.  But I highly do not recommend reading this to young children.  They would not predict that the pigs would be eaten and that the wolf would be eaten at the end.  A way to use this book in the classroom would be to read a few other versions of the three little pigs to the class and compare and contrast them.  Have the students work in groups to formulate similarities and differences of the characters, plot, setting and more.
1400079179|1.0|What a haphazard piece of junk.  I was expecting a good novel, not something so poorly written that I now think of the Area 51 series as amazing literature.  This book is nothing more than a jumble of \\"facts\\" strewn throughout the length, with no character development whatsoever.  I recommend simply reading Holy Blood, Holy Grail.  At least then the facts would actually be right.<br />As to the Christians bashing the book just because of its subject matter, why in the hell would you read this in the first place if not to have something to whine about?
B000FIMG68|1.0|All the reviewers are correct this show sucks!
6305212112|5.0|I used to rent this movie from the library when I was a child and watch it with my sister, mother and grandmother.  As I think about it now, that is quite representational of the movie's ability to span the genrational gap.   <br /> <br />With classic actresses Jessica Tandy and Kathy Bates to the more modern Mary Stuart Masterson, this storyline was bound to snap to life, but I don't know if has been as widely recognized as it deserves to be.  I am ashamed to say that I was unaware that it was previously a novel, but I am now very eager to read it. <br /> <br />
B000002MJC|5.0|While this is The Album that pushed DM (and Alan Wilder) over the emotional edge, the tension certainly wasn't put to waste.  I truly hated this album upon first hearing.  After riding the sweet aural waves of \\"Black Celebration\\", \\"Music For The Masses\\" and \\"Violator\\", nothing could be farther from that bliss than \\"SOFAD\\".  I did find, however, that as I matured, so did my taste for the subject matter on this album.  The lyrics are from the heart.  The production and sounds are rich & layered.  Gahan's vocals have true grit, hardship & pain.  You simply cannot fake this.  Put your headphones on and listen to this album in it's entirety.  You'll likely hear something different every time you do.  13 years later and I'm still discovering the intricacies of this great album.
B000F48CD8|5.0|The Raconteurs just released \\"THE\\" indispensable groundbreaking cd for the summer of 2006. BROKEN BOY SOLDIER is amazing bouncy pop that will rock you with a potent edge. The CD bursts with melodies strongly influenced by the legends of rock past. True,  \\"STEADY AS SHE GOES\\" is the first catchy release from the Raconteurs to hit the airwaves yet it's surprisingly far from being the strongest & most memorable track on the collection. The second track \\"HANDS\\" instantly conjures up the harmonious spirit of the Beatles circa their Rubber Soul era. The track \\"BROKEN BOY SOLDIER\\" is fueled by the essence of Robert Plant ~ Led Zepplin & classic 70s rock. \\"INTIMATE\\" retains a great lead vocal performance comparable to the amazing John Lennon performances on several of his solo efforts. The musical effects on \\"BLUE VEINS\\" recall the Beatles' \\"White Album\\". The song \\"Level\\" owns a sturdy musical hook that evokes 1970's BABE RUTH song \\"The Mexican\\" combined with a solid ROBERT PLANT vocal delivery. All in all the entire CD is strong enough, from start to finish, to be an immediate must own. If you have but only one CD to purchase this year in 2006, make it this one. This is great musical hear candy. You are going to want to have the glory of making all your friends hear the Raconteurs prior to them becoming insanely popular! 5 STARS  X  5 !
076790592X|4.0|I had read this book a couple of times in high school, but it really didn't mean much to me then.  When I saw that this was part of the assignment in my sociology class, I more than procrastinated in picking it up again because I thought it was the same old thing, but I was pleasantly surprised.  The book read faster than I had remembered, and I actually got  interested in the topics that Mitch and Morrie discussed.  Their practical life lessons, I thougth, were valuable things for just about everyone to know.  I really enjoyed this book, and it has made me look at life, living, and eventually dying, a little bit differently.
B000002LCI|4.0|A good record for it's time, I must admit it has lost some of it's polish over the years.  While Alan Wilder's top notch production and Martin Gore's melancholy lyrics still hold enough to muster the interest of passers by, this is really an album for those who were there & lived it.  A good re-visit to the late 80's...but those who are just discovering DM may have a harder time accessing it's sound.
0553582461|4.0|As a praise to Hobb I can't lay down this last book out of an epic fantasy series without feeling the need to say a word of praise to Hobb.  <br /> <br />As an adult male I still can't believe the emotional attachment I have to Fitz and this from the hand of a female writer. Somewhere in the lines of the story you become Fitz and all that becomes you, you will feel it. All the desperation, the hate and joy will flood through you. Absolutely perfect. <br /> <br />I do have to state though that some of the decisions made in the 2nd Farseer trilogy(seeing the Lifeship series as a background story) does leave me disagreeing and as someone stated here seemed for the good of the plot, not being rational. <br /> <br />This leaves the ending, which should have been a 100+ pages longer. Too many loose ends are being tied together too quickly in the otherwise very deep and analysing style of writing. There is nothing left to wonder about as a reader and that is a 101 in writing endings. <br /> <br />Best emotional attachment to a character ever. Ending should have been more in line with the 'feel' of the book.
1400032717|4.0|the book is interesting and fun. it's amusing to read about what the \\"special- main charcter\\" is thinking. there are doubts in the book of what will happen, but the conclusion is better than what you expect. it's a great book it's nice and readable.
B000B2YQX4|2.0|Once again, DM runs with a producer who's sound lends dullness rather than excitement.  More pointless \\"bleeps\\" & \\"squelches\\" that do not further the meoldy and actually prevent the song from becoming a true DM classic.  \\"Precious\\" being the only stand-out track and a true return to what DM is, dark & deep lyrical content, strong vocals, and a good beat to match.  \\"Suffer Well\\" coming in a strong second and really should have been a strong contender, it simply cannot overcome shoddy production.  Skip this album & buy anything from \\"Ultra\\" and earlier.
B00025ETIW|2.0|Heather B. Jones, idiot. <br />Before you start casting stones at REAL punk bands like the Pistols <br />you'd better start minding the facts and not believe the myths. <br />NOBODY told the Pistols to act \\"Punk\\". They disdained that label, as it was used by the media and as such, the fans picked up on it. <br />The Pistols wrote all their own music and lyrics and Johnny Rotten was dressing so called punk before their big break even happened. <br /> Like em' or not the Pistols were and still are more original than your precious My Chemical Imbalance. Who are a bunch of inept, musically impotent mall-gawths and wouldn't know a good riff if it smacked them upside their heads. I applaud your open mindedness to music, but you've got to learn your music history little girl. I give this 2 stars for it's amusing factor. Only a <br />band of idiots would actually think they're wittily clever to come up with the title \\" You Know What They Do To Guy's Like Us, In Prison! Who are they kidding? Don't bother answering that. I already know!
1400079179|4.0|Readers ought to allow this book to nudge them to learn more about all the (otherwise unrelated) threads that Dan Brown used to weave this interesting tapestry.  This is fiction (meaning that it isn't true) so you can enjoy it (or not) without accepting a single word of it as truth.  Possibly because of my own deep religious convictions and because I have always tried to found those convictions on evidence and careful investigation, this fiction held my attention from the beginning.  I do not understand those who would ban it.  It does not contain dangerous and scary ideas to be outlawed.  In fact, it would seem that those who want to believe the truth (that which accords with reality) would want to explore alternative explanations and all logical possibilities before settling on any particular belief.  The mentality that one should just believe what he or she has been raised to believe and close ones eyes to all other possibilities is much more dangerous than The Da Vinci Code, an interesting work of fiction.  Truth bears up under close scrutiny.  The \\"fictional facts\\" that this book weaves together so creatively do not bear up and one would not demand that of them in this work of fiction any more than one would demand that the creator of Harry Potter must show Hogwarts on a map and prove, scientifically, that certain boys and girls can fly on brooms.<br />This book will have a very positive effect if it puts in motion a spirit of genuine inquiry from which the truth can never suffer.
B00005JLZN|5.0|This movie was very well done.Kevin Spacey is a great actor , as well as Kate Winslet (of the Titanic) and this film does NOT dissapoint.<br /><br />The whole movie revolves around a death row advocacy group who David Gale (Spacey) belongs to, called \\"Death Watch\\" His \\"victim\\" for whose murder he is incarcerated FOR , also heads this group .<br /><br />With only a few days to go before his execution,Winslet is sent to the prison to interview him,and the more his story unfolds ,the more horrified she becomes that he is innocent and about to die. In a race to prove this,  we are kept on the edge of our seats.<br /><br />The plot unravels one layer at a time,and builds to a shocking conclusion.I won't spoil it, just see it, if you like well written,well acted,highly entertaining movies,you'll like this one.<br />It is so well put together, and I don't understand why this movie was so overlooked. It should have been an award winner!
0451191153|5.0|For starters: ignore the morons who call the characters too idealistic, too one sided, etc. That's the whole point. This novel is a clear cut expression of philosophy. Dont expect to find well balanced characters. The characters are purposely polar and exaggerated. <br /> <br />Now... <br /> <br />Despite the philosophical themes, I enjoyed this novel greatly. It has humor if you know where to look (for instance the check exchange between Keating and Roark). I cant stop reading it. The story is fast paced and contains very few boring bumps, unlike most novels. The story is almost entirely allegorical. I love finding a meaning behind almost every dialogue and description. <br /> <br />5/5 Read this book!
B00028HBKC|5.0|This movie was very hard to watch because His death WAS very ugly, yet I personally believe it to be accurate with what the Bible says.Although I don't know all the beliefs in all the Religions,I have read the Gospels in the Bible, and it seemed the movie played out just as the Bible read.<br /><br />The movie only focuses on the last 12 hours of Christ's earth life.And although it is hard to watch, It's a great reminder of the Gift that was given to us all.<br /><br />The performances are nothing less than spectacular, and I found this movie to be deeply touching.
B000F1IQMS|2.0|Sword of Gideon came out on VHS in 1987 and it was better than Munich.  Obviously the story was the same but SoG did a better job with action and keeping your interest.  I was very disappointed since it's been 19 years since the same flick came out under a different title.
B000002H33|5.0|\\"battery\\" is one of the most intense album openers ever,starting off with spanish sounding guitars and slowly building up the tension until it finally explodes into a riff heavy enough to cause an earthquake..and then proceeding to beat you sensless for 5 mins (apt song title then) it really is an unforgettable moment.Great thing is though,its only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to this classic...this is their most conceptual and bleak album,the punk influences of \\"kill em all\\" and \\"ride the lightning\\" have been completely erased and in its place is a much heavier beast...whereas as \\"ride the lightnings\\" guitars thrashed \\"master of puppets\\" are like a pneumatic drill,pounding away at your brain and creating an allmost unbearable feeling of claustraphobia.The lyrics add to the unease,especially on the harrowing \\"sanitarium (welcome home)\\" which vividly describes life in a mental institute.Then theres the truly punishing \\"leper messiah\\" which has an unbelievably heavy riff (even by the rest of the albums standards) and the classic title track..this is considered by many to be Metallica's defining album...im not sure but as far as im concerned everything up to and including \\"metallica\\" is essential..but rest assured you cant go wrong with this masterpiece!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|It's a great, rip-roaring science-fiction movie, but it also has very positive individualist themes - how evil Utopianism and the suppression of human nature is, how belief in false values is evil and how one must take a stance for good values, and the value of benevolence. <br /> <br />Also, I really liked the language that they used in the movie. I can figure out the movie is very Western in orientation. Typically Westerns are very individualistic, so I thought that fit very well in the movie.
B000002H97|5.0|This album is endlessly critisised by snobby purists for the heinious crime of being accessible...and in fact I was one of those people who listened to it once or twice and dismissed it beacause the songs werent 10 mins long...then one fateful day I felt drawn to it again.I pulled it out of the cd rack and put it on,full blast,start to finish and WOW!..this is an absolute classic,the production is exemplary,meaning every cruching, pounding riff hits its intended target..and the songs are their sharpest,most direct and most anthemic ever...\\"enter sandman\\" is unforgettable,\\"wherever I may roam\\" is an absolute juggernaut,\\"the unforgiven\\" is truly sublime and theres is absolutely no way you will not head bang yourself to the emergency ward when you hear \\"sad but true\\" which has a dense,punishing,sledgehammer riff and hard hitting lyrics.. <br />Its the perfect starting point for anyone wanting to get into Metallica before you move on to the more inaccessible territories of \\"and justice for all\\" and \\"master of puppets\\" because ok,its more mainstream than said albums but its still EXTREMELY heavy and makes 99% of todays pretenders like trivium sound as lame as they are!
076792603X|1.0|I am so amazed that such a poorly written book has garnered so much attention and praise.  This goes to show what American marketing can do for what's really a worthless peice of [choose your pleasure].<br /><br />The writing is dull and lifeless.  It couldn't even pull me in.  I was amazed at how utterly boring the book was.<br /><br />The pictures are the ONLY redeemable factor to this edition.  THe book itself is a merciless waste of trees.
B000002H2H|5.0|I think the track listing speaks for itself....this is one of the greatest heavy metal albums of all time..significantly more technically complex and progressive than their debut yet still possesing some of its predecessors punk spirit.The classic's just keep on coming,\\"fade to black\\" is one of the bands finest moments..\\"creeping death\\" never fails to send shivers down your spine as James hetfield belligerently sings \\"die by my hand,I creep across the land,killing first born man\\" then theres \\"for whom the bell tolls\\" which is a metallica staplemate and of course the Dave Mustaine penned title track with the lyrics \\"death's in the air/strapped into the electric chair\\" this album is a like a lesson in how heavy metal should be done..period!
0140288503|5.0|Even if you've seen the movie, the book is definately worth reading. I have read many accounts of military combat, and this is one of the best such books out there.  Intense action throughout. <br /> <br />The author goes to great lengths to get his facts straight.  For example, the book is based largely on interviews with people who were actually there. At first, when reading the book, I was skeptical when the author would tell the reader what someone in the story was thinking--I wondered how he could know that. But he actually found out what those people were thinking by interviewing them.  Everything in quotations represents the actual words somebody said (often taken from radio recordings made by the military). The author also went to Somolia to interview soldiers who fought against the Americans to get their side of the story. He was the only American journalist to visit the scene of the battle for years afterwards.
B00006EXL5|5.0|Despite what people say that write reviews based on trashing music they don't listen to, I like this kind of music and I think the CD is great. I listen to this CD more than the new one. Of course the quality is not as good, but it's nice to hear them raw and before they were discovered. If you like this kind of music, buy it. If you don't, please don't waste your time and other people's time by just being dumb and ignorant.
0451163516|5.0|I bought this book when it was first published oh so many years ago. It's one of Follett's best and I must have re-read it 20 times. It's that good.  <br /> <br />This isn't one of those exciting page turning books that keep you up til 2am. To use the words of one of the reviwers below, it's a character driven book. And the characters are fully fleshed, right from the first time you meet them. That's why you can re-read these books. With most thrillers, you can only read them once because once you know how it ends the excitement is gone. But with books like this (which it seems authors don't know how to write any more) you can keep reading them again and again because the characters are old friends that you revisit each time you re-read the book.  <br /> <br />I must admit the plot is a little simplistic compared to best sellers of today, but it doesn't really detract from the enjoyment of this book. If you are a true book lover who loves character driven drama you must buy this book. <br /> <br />This is one of Follett's early books and he hasn't written like this ever again.
0307277674|3.0|OK, the plot was compelling. The writing, however, was common and predictable. This novel is NOT literature and no one can say that this is a beautifully-written book.
0451147960|5.0|Why all the negative reviews??? <br /> <br />A delightful little mystery, written when he was still an unknown, and I think originally published under some other name? Of course you cannot compare this little book (a short one) with the best of the best sellers today, but you must remember it was written many years ago. Put yourself in 1986 or whenever this was written when you read it.  <br /> <br />Fans of Ken Follett must get this book. I think it's even better than some of the books written right after he got famous, which I thought were too pretentious (the books, not him). You should be grateful this book has been reprinted.
0689865384|5.0|At first glance you might take this book to be one of those run of the mill teen stories, you know the kind, the one in which a girl tries to gain status in a teen queen society, but The Uglies is anything BUT that.    <br />The Uglies digs deeper into the realms of what it takes to be \\"pretty\\" and puts a high-tech spin on it.  The way Westerfeld approaches the society that Tally and Shay live in is new and well awaited.  The best part about this book is how Westerfeld sets up situations and adventures for Tally and Shay. The struggles are not like anything that teens can relate to DIRECTLY but there are moments where I felt empathy for the characters and their situations.  This is one of the best books that I have EVER read. <br />The way Westerfeld tries to put a spin on how teens live their lives is amazing.  His creativity and tendency towards the dramatic leaves the reader wanting MORE!!! I cannot WAIT to read the sequels to this and see what happens to Tally and Shay in their High-Tech world!!! <br />
0765315246|5.0|21 Years ago I read Starship Troopers for the first time and all I could think and feel was:  <br /> <br />Wow. Blown Away. <br /> <br />I've read a ton of SF since then, some great, some awful, most in-between. I've read all the 'masters' and 'must reads'. My several bookcases sag under the weight of the volumes I have stuffed in them.  <br /> <br />After finishing the final page of Old Mans War, the only thing I could think and feel was: <br /> <br />Wow. Blown Away. <br /> <br />I haven't felt that way about a work of SF in 21 years. Close perhaps, but not quite there. <br /> <br />Thank you Mr. Scalzi for bringing that back. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000B0QJM2|1.0|Very deceiving....please do not buy this you will be greatly upset !!!!
0385512058|5.0|This book is a great reminder that connectivity is valuable.  Interaction with others brings diverse value to one's own life, and there are still unwritten rules that people will judge you by.  Being saavy to these rules is extremely helpful in business or personal life. I found Ferrazzi's ideas refreshing in an age where applying effort in relationships went out with high button shoes.
0767802470|5.0|Das Boot is the first movie that comes to mind,when thinking of movies that \\"are as close to the real thing as possible.\\" The claustrophobic and terrifying conditions that submariners deal with are clearly shown as to why,for example of the forty thousand men German U-Boat men during WWII,only ten thousand survived-and it's hard to believe that any of the survivors survived in one piece-mentally.Director Wolfgang Petersen was a little off in his comments about this film not being about French or German or \\"whoever\\" submariners,but about people.Actually,this is the only film I've seen about the WWII era,in which I was hoping to see the German U-boaters(aside from the card-carrying Nazi's on board)to survive.And as far as survival goes,the ending leaves me depressed whenever I see it.
B00005JKG7|5.0|For John Carpenter, following up the success of Halloween had to be a stressful affair. In creating \\"The Fog,\\" Carpenter did many things right. He brought back the screechingly charming Jamie Lee Curtis and added her mother to the cast, to boot. Then he enticed the bodacious Adrian Barbeau to the project and the talent roster was complete.<br /><br />But the real major player in \\"The Fog\\" is the fog itself. Always menacing, creeping like a shadow, and hiding whatever horrors have come upon this small hamlet.<br /><br />Carpenter is a genius with using things like darkness, shadows and fog to sustain the horror. He chooses to keep the terrors from view and instead, lets them lurk along the corners of your eyes. \\"The Fog,\\" like \\"Halloween\\" before it, largely lets your imagination do all the heavy lifting and the result is a crawling sense of uneasiness that will leave you tense even after the credits have rolled.<br /><br />\\"The Fog\\" is basic horror. It slipped in before the slasher films really took off, relying on atmosphere and a compelling story to deliver the chills rather than million dollar effects and gallons of Hollywood blood.<br /><br />A hundred years ago, the founding fathers of this coastal community tricked a group of lepers into crashing their ship and spilling their gold into the sea. Since that fateful treachery was undertaken, the fog returns to the hamlet to seek out descendants of those betrayers. Within the fog is horror that you cannot always see. Which, of course, is the beauty and danger of fog.<br /><br />Each time I watch this movie, I am struck at how effectively Carpenter casts his spell. Five minutes in, you'll smell the salty scent of fog and feel its chill upon your skin. After that, it's 90 minutes of Carpenter magic, accompanied by the nails-on-a-blackboard scream of Jamie Lee, and the encroaching unpleasantness of the fog.
B00003CXB4|5.0|The perfect movie. Or rather, the perfect animated musical. Few endeavors in any of the creative fields actually deserve such a classification, yet The Lion King is definitely one of them. In size, style, scope and grandeur, this film `nails it' in every single category. The story is simple and moving, built on the most basic archetypes cast in the mold of the best Campbellian ideas and concepts. Like the very first Star Wars movie, The Lion King takes the age-old ideas of birth, death, self-identity and fulfillment, and reconciliation, and folds those them into a story so compelling and gut-wrenching, that these old themes seem new, and totally original.<br /><br />These ideas are almost clich&eacute; for the same reasons that make them powerful - in essence, they are the moral and spiritual counterparts of the limbs of our physical bodies - ephemeral parts of us that, though intangible, grow and evolve nonetheless. It is no surprise then, that stories that successfully draw on these archetypal themes work as well as they do, and have such universal appeal. It is those ideas that make The Lion King such a fully realized and complete film, but, they are not the only reasons for its success.<br /><br />Underneath the tale of The Lion King is a hidden controversy that gives compelling evidence to suggest that Disney may have \\"borrowed heavily\\" from an existing Japanese tale of a little white lion cub named Kimba, and how he, too, was orphaned, and overcame incredible odds to rise to the throne of king in his own inspirational tale. Again, the similarities between the two stories are a bit too much to dismiss out of hand, and the controversy exists to this day. But, whatever the source Disney may have used for the story of The Lion King, the result is still nothing short of perfect, powerful, and majestic.<br /><br />This perfection is no accident or mistake, but rather, the result of the blending of many talents and efforts, hundreds of artisans from the tops in their respective fields of animation, music, voice casting and characterization, and dialog. Along the way, there are startlingly good performances in each of these areas, from Jeremy Irons as Scar, to Nathan Lane as Timon the meerkat. There are notable highlights resulting from this convergence of great talent - Timon's genuinely humorous shtick, Scar's seething rendition of the deliciously Broadway-style declamatory song, Be Prepared, and even the African sunrise at the very beginning of the film. Underpinning it all, the mystical and compelling musical score by Hans Zimmer.<br /><br />The overall tone of the film is telegraphed like a knockout punch at the very beginning with stirring African vocals by Lebo M., behind a hauntingly beautiful African sunrise, and leading into the central thematic song, Circle of Life, performed by Carmen Twillie (Elton John, who wrote the song with Tim Rice, performs it on the CD soundtrack). Once this mood is set, the movie never looks back, and progresses assuredly and non-stop, to its logical, fulfilling, and enjoyable end.<br /><br />As other reviewers have noted, The Lion King may be a bit much for children under a certain age, who may find it at times brutal, or just plain incomprehensible in some of its more adult themes. But it is definitely a five-star effort - one with that rare quality of `re-view-ability': a movie that even adults can view again and again and again.ic, voice casting and characterization, and dialog.

B00000811N|5.0|If you are one who believes that music ought to be made with guitar, bass, drums and maybe some keyboards only. DO NOT BUY THIS CD!!! However, if you are open to music which is made utilizing natural sounds and processes these sounds to express musical ideas then this cd may be for you.  Much of the cd is expressed utilizing ideas and techniques commonly found in avante garde, musique concrete and electoacoustic soundscapes.  Sometimes beautiful, sometimes abstract and dark this often overlooked cd takes you on a journey to places previously unknown and some more familiar places.   Individual breakdowns of songs would be pointless since this work is meant to be taken as a whole.  The acoustic moments where Roger accompanies himself are great and are juxtaposed against the more abstract pieces brilliantly.  To sum it up... If you are a fan of Floyd's leaning towards the abstract (ie found in sections of Atom Heart Mother, Ummagumma) then you will probably be pleased with this cd.  If your favorite Pink Floyd song is Money or Comfortably Numb, and listen to predominantly 70's classic rock, you probably will want to stay away from this one
0307277674|2.0|I read \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" (DVC) about 2 years ago, and I can't figure out what all the hype is about.  I'm a big mystery fan, and this book is not a stellar example of the mystery/thriller genre.  It's jumpy, truncated style seems more suited to a movie than to a book (I'm curious to see what Ron Howard has done with it).<br /><br />I'm also not sure why everyone is getting excited about the fictional code, in which Jesus marries Mary Magdalene and has a child.  Is there any evidence for this in scholarly works? I know that this is suggested by the recent \\"Gospel of Judas\\" (despite the fact that the Bible has Judas dying or committing suicide after his betrayal, so how could he write a Gospel??), but there are a lot of spurious gospels floating around out there.  I don't want to get into religious theory (especially since I am no theologian), but I can't see any evidence for the theories suggested by DVC or by \\"Holy Blood, Holy Grail\\".  Maybe da Vinci himself did believe in Christ's marriage, etc., but that does not make it true!<br /><br />A much better take on the Priory of Sion and Christ's putative marriage is in \\"The Serpent Garden\\", by Judith Merkle Riley.  Her character Susanna has the best answer to the controversy that I've ever read: Jesus' death and resurrection prove his divinity.  If he escaped death and ran off to France (why France? In the 1st century AD, it was just an obscure backwater), then he was just an ordinary guy, and therefore had no special significance or powers, thus negating the entire premise of DVC.<br /><br />Seriously, read \\"The Serpent Garden\\" instead of, or in addition to, DVC.  It's a better story and much better written.
0684824906|5.0|This superb narrative provides a revealing look inside the Lincoln White House while also providing stellar character studies of both the President and his major associates.  Author/Historian Doris Kearns Goodwin begins with a lengthy examination of the political rises of the four contenders for the 1860 Presidential Nomination; Lincoln, William Seward, Salmon Chase, and Edward Bates.  After winning the Presidency, Lincoln named each of these defeated rivals to his cabinet, knowing that despite their bitter envy, he needed their stellar talents in the dark days that lay ahead.  <br /> <br />The author shows how Lincoln's remarkable empathy and deep understanding of human nature helped him soothe egos and mold his cabinet into a vitally effective team.  That plus his vision and political skills made him a superb leader in troubled times.  We also see how the talents of his cabinet members (other than Simon Cameron) proved vital to the nation and the war effort.  Goodwin also devotes attention to the key roles of family members like Marie Todd Lincoln, Kate Chase, and Francis Seward - some of this attention was vital, but some seemed superfluous.  I felt the author went too easy on Lincoln's choice of inept generals and acceding to unfair draft laws, but this remains a powerful narrative though all 754 pages.   <br /> <br />This superb narrative is well worth your effort - although it is not really civil war history nor biography.  Readers might also enjoy NO ORDINARY TIME, the author's equally good (and Pulitzer-Prize winning) narrative about the Roosevelt White House during World War II.    <br />
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I just finished watching the last episode on the last DVD of the now-cancelled TV series \\"Firefly.\\" This was a show that deserved to last a while. Instead we got 14 episodes and a good movie, \\"Serenity.   <br /> <br />\\"Firefly\\" is a space Western set 500 years in the future. Captain Malcolm Reynolds and the eight persons in his crew -- each of them individualistic and finely crafted -- are petty crooks and gunmen, including a mechanic, a pilot, a beautiful \\"companion\\", a preacher, a doctor, and a mysterious weird child. They skulk around the inhabited planets in their decrepit spaceship \\"Serenity\\" looking for work and plunder. Behind this simple outline are deep and dark stories.  <br /> <br />The Serenity crew is a diverse, close-knit, mutually-supportive group we'd all like to belong too. They have their warts and they fight and argue -- but the come together when it matters. The set is wonderful; the interior of a space ship that looks like it works, not a tin foil mock up. The soundtrack music is appropriately creepy; the camera work is oddly-angled; the lighting goes from the brightest of bright to dark and menacing. The script is clever and amusing. Homey scenes alternate with quick violence, brutality, and a fair amount of sex.  <br /> <br />\\"Firefly\\" reminds me of the old TV Western \\"Maverick\\" with James Garner. \\"Maverick\\" was a Western like you had never seen before with everything just a bit off-kilter. \\"Firefly\\" is like this.

B000EULJLU|4.0|I used to be transfixed by these guys's videos and I never turn the metal station when they play Tool, but somehow I just never got the fever enough to buy an album.  Somehow, Maynard James Keenan's lyrics always seemed a little bit TOO nihilistic; the band had an impressive array of time signatures to mess around with, but it was all the same heavy metal crunch that Deep Purple started perfecting almost forty years ago.<br /><br />Well, I picked this up when I was in a metal mood the other day and am so far favorably impressed.  It isn't all about the dripping dark lyrics and insane drums, though of course these are on prominent display here.  They do really intriguing things with atmosphere here.  I, for one, rather enjoy ambient pieces like \\"Viginti Tres.\\"  As far as I am concerned, not every song needs to be a raging riff-fest; it's interesting to hear intriguing sounds after more traditional Tool fare like \\"The Pot.\\"  People griped about this sort of thing on Mars Volta's _Frances the Mute_, but I liked it when they went away from traditional \\"songs\\" and almost crossed over into the space between music and language, music and film, however you might put it.  Come on, people, give a band some creative license.  How many different ways can Tool play \\"Prison Sex\\"?  They are artists, people, they need to try new things to progress into the future.  Instrumental pieces like \\"Lipan Conjuring\\" aren't filler like other people have said, they are evocative experiments.  I especially like the soundtrack to this one, which in combination with the music evokes mental illness in as spooky a manner as anything this side of _Dark Side of the Moon_.  I like the other songs that develop this slowly, too, like the title track.<br /><br />That being said, I still have some of the same qualms with Tool as I always did.  A Perfect Circle intrigued me because Keenan was using more of a harmonic set-up to back him up, but really, are things as bleak as he paints them?  Certainly, sometimes, but I think Keenan and Tool would grow even more if everything wasn't such a freakin' downer 24-7.  Their prog prototypes like King Crimson know how to have a little fun here and there without being trite.  \\"Cat Food\\" is one among many examples.  Tool and Perfect Circle could stand to lighten up some.<br /><br />And the riffage does get a little monotonous by the ten-minute mark on some of these.  Every tone doesn't have to be distorted.  Keenan and A Perfect Circle display this, but I guess Tool have a market niche to fulfill.  Believe me, I love extreme distortion and dark lyrics as the next bloke, but all this all the time wears a little thin.<br /><br />This album certainly redeems their formula on many levels, though.  I especially like \\"Right in Two,\\" an almost dadaistic song about \\"monkey killin'.\\"  Yes, certainly, more of the satanic from Keenan, but the development of this song builds both lyrically and musically (tabla!) to a well-nigh unforgettable (soft?) maelstrom by the end.  I think it might be my favorite from them, even though I don't exactly know all of their songs.  Hardcore Tool fans might not take a lot from my review, and in any case, they already have the album.  From my humble perspective, I think they have managed to keep and work with classic elements of their style while considerably adding intriguing and hypnotic elements to their music that I have not heard thus far.sometimes, but I think Keenan and Tool would grow even more if everything wasn't such a freakin' downer 24-7.

B000EJ9MTW|3.0|Well, there's obviously something very enduring about the sources Wolfmother ape here.  If not, they wouldn't be getting the sort of attention they are.  Take 5 parts Sabbath, 2 parts Deep Purple, 1 part Zeppelin, 1 part Tull, and one part yourself=et voila!  The next indie-rock revival!  Might be able to give Franz Ferdinand a run for their money and their own short-lived Gang of Four/early XTC revival.  And proceed to sink into oblivion, if they don't up the originality quotient.<br /><br />I must assume responsibility for buying this, on the other hand.  I bought this knowing full well what I was getting into.  With the cheap price, I couldn't resist, though (Note to consumer: When a new full-length CD is this cheap, it is almost always a sign that the record company knows it's not worth the full price and they're gonna get it off their hands.  What new CLASSIC have you ever bought off of the cheap racks at Target or Best Buy?  I don't think I have bought any.)  From the '70s-sounding name of the band and its songs, to the Dio-style artwork on the cover, it was quite clear I was supporting the revival of all the heavy aesthetics that fueled my early adolescence.  Truth be told, Wolfmother makes me nostalgic for these times.  But do they take me past this?  Barely.<br /><br />So okay, Andrew Stockdale's vocals switch off between perfect approximations of early Ozzy, Jack White, and even Rik Emmett of Triumph, all of these men masters of straddling the line between their natural voices and a falsetto.  And, yeah, the organ kicks in sometimes, that kick-ass distorted Hammond a la Deep Purple coming in when it really counts.  Silly mystical lyrics about women that are gonna set you free and fake cosmic revelations . . . yeah, yeah, yeah.  This stuff is awesome.  What makes it good this time around, though?<br /><br />Here's my crackpot theory.  The early Sabbath school of metal is so potent that it needs to resurge every fifteen years or so (from the appearance of things).  The raw production, sludgy guitars, man-at-the-edge-of-mania lyrics--f**k yeah.  A whole slew of bands mined this vein to varying success in the early '90's, approximately fifteen years after Sabbath stopped being very good (when Dio came in).  Cosmic Psychos (another bunch of Aussies!): Okay, a novelty, kinda fun, certainly, but more or less of a toss-off.  Thee Hypnotics?  A little more hypnotic apropos their namesake, kind of a spectacle.  A little bit better.  I'd put them back on my CD player now for the sake of nostalgia.  That's about it.  Soundgarden?  Now there's a Sabbath-inspired band that made the music their own and _Louder Than Love_ and _Ultramega OK_ still rock like you can't take it.<br /><br />From what I can hear here, Wolfmother is around the level of Thee Hypnotics (approximately fifteen years after them).  I don't think they'll be rising to the level of Soundgarden . . . ever.  See, when Soundgarden started, you could say \\"hmmm, sounds like Sabbath and Zeppelin, but there's definitely something truly different here . . . Kim Thayil's raga guitar, maybe, Chris Cornell's own demoniacal soul, these guys are really gonna be something.\\"  You can't say that about Wolfmother: you can't give them a new genre distinction like \\"grunge\\" to differentiate them from what came before.  That's because they are pretty much exactly what came before.  This is '70s rock.  Period.  The organ goes off onto a few more prolonged dissonant runs than Deep Purple ever did (Chris Ross in certainly no Jon Lord when it comes down to it).  But that doesn't make them more than what came before.<br /><br />Poststructural philosophers talk about this phenomenon.  There are three kinds of eternal returns.  We can't help the past returning, but the past can return in different manners.  Wolfmother would be the second return.  It's good, you realize it's occurring, as opposed to the first return, which comes to you unawares, but there's not necessarily any critical spiritthat accompanies the second return.  The third return, well, that's when you take the return of the same and make things different with it.  It takes a mighty spirit to do things in the spirit of the third return: A Led Zeppelin, a Soundgarden, a Jack White . . . you can expand the list, but you certainly can't put every Johnny-come-lately like Wolfmother on it.  The second return?  You can party to it, have good times, experience nostalgia, but don't expect it to revolutionize your life or anyone else's.  Can this cycle of the return of early Sabbath have a big payoff in 2006?  Well, certainly, if a new band steps up and makes the return a third return.  But they can't do it by aping Sabbath or the band of the third return in 1991, Soundgarden.  They can use elements of these giants, but they truly have to make it their own.  Wolfmother don't do this on their self-titled album and I don't think they will do this in the future.  Expect fun out of this one and a crash-course on '70s rock if you are not educated.  Beyond that, wait for the real thing to come along or make it happen yourself, because Wolfmother isn't it.al spirit that accompanies the second return.

0739313126|2.0|Disclaimer:  I am a Roman Catholic with a Masters in Theology so that no doubt colors my review of this book.  My wife bought it for me, not because I was interested in reading it but because she thought I needed to be ready to answer the invariable questions I would get from friends because of it.  Having little time for fiction, she got me the audio book to listen to in the car to and from work.  While the abridged version leaves out some of the worst diatribes about Christianity and the Catholic Church, I still believe I got the flavor of the book.  Vanilla.<br /><br />All in all, a pretty bland novel.  Ludlum or Le Carre (among many, many others) write a much better thriller.  I have to hand it to Dan Brown, he knows how to weave in just enough truth in with all the blatant errors to make people go \\"Aha!  I figured it out!  Why did I not see that before?\\"  It moves along fairly breathlessly but the plot holes are so large as to be laughable.  Why, for instance, if Jesus was just a man and not divine do we really care who his decendants are and why are they any more special that anyone else?  Are we really supposed to believe that Jesus was a proto-feminist pagan who happened to grow up in a Jewish culture?  Or perhaps Judaism also was subject to a vast conspiracy by the Emperor Constantine that turned it from Yaweh as Goddess to unapologetically patriarchal.  Speaking of Constantine, how can anyone with a modicum of knowledge of Church History believe that the Roman Emperor could simply decree a fundamental and radical shift in the very fundamental tenets of Christianity and all the Christians around the world went from believing Jesus was human to saying, \\"Oh!  We've been dying for our faith up to now but since this new Emperor says that faith isn't what we thought it was let's all go with his interpretation.  Silly us.\\"  For that matter, if Jesus was only a man and Mary Magdeleine was only a woman, why did Langdon feel the need to pray at her tomb?  (sorry for the spoiler, but I doubt I am giving anything away).<br /><br />I understand Brown's defense of \\"It's only fiction\\" but he wants to have it both ways.  He dismisses the critics by saying its only fiction but then insists that this is carefully researched history.  Intellectual dishonesty at it's most blatant.<br /><br />But back to the novel itself.  The plot is almost non-existant.  The \\"puzzles\\" are less difficult than a Mensa quiz.  The characters are two-dimensional and almost laughably stereotypical.  The villain an albino monk?  Makes sense: let's pick a villain that won't stand out in a crowd.  George Smiley would cringe.  Hard to believe that this bunch has managed to keep the world's greatest global conspiracy going for 2,000 years.<br /><br />The only thing that kept me from simply turning it off and throwing it out was curiosity at how Brown would wrap it all up at the end.  How would he keep the Big Secret from getting out without and still have Langdon win in the end?  The answer was a tremendous letdown.  I agree with the review I read of \\"The Da Vinci Mole\\" by Dr. Ian Browne which said that parody \\"pulls off a brilliant \\"emperor-has-no-clothes dismissal of the original.\\"  I agree.  The emperor has no clothes.<br /><br />Given some of the other wonderful books I have read recently, I am at a loss to figure out why this novel has been so successful.  Perhaps, in the end, Mencken was right, \\"No one ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the American People.\\"or the spoiler, but I doubt I am giving anything away). <br /> <br />I understand Brown's defense of \\"It's only fiction\\" but he wants to have it both ways.

B000E5N62U|3.0|By now, the formula is firmly established: funky, pile-driving bass, tasty guitar licks and kick-ass kick-drums. On top of that, Fagen's distinctive wry vocalizing. I like this album (although some songs just go on too long, What I Do being Exhibit A), but I'm wondering if this represents artistic progress for Fagen. Too formulaic, similar tempos and unvarying harmonic palette (although that palette does shine nicely here).<br /><br />The funk-band side of Steely Dan first appeared on Aja and took full root with Gaucho. Pretzel Logic and Gaucho represent two wholly dissimilar approaches to the rhythm section and I know which one I prefer. My question is: now that Fagen probably has all the money he needs why does he persist with these cookie-cutter tunes? Has he abdicated bebop? And even rock and roll, for that matter?
B000AMJG4Y|4.0|I went into the whole fiasco of Advent Children with the expectation that, while the animation was sure to be a stunner, it wouldn't exactly corner the market on characterization, scripting, or storyline, and it seems that I was right. With that in mind even before I saw the movie, I have to say that I enjoyed Advent Children. A LOT. <br /> <br />I love the maturization and the realistic feel of the characters-a far cry from the more animelike depictions in FFVII, the game, but the designs were still in keeping with the feel of the original. That was cool-I don't think I would have enjoyed a CG 'cartoon' nearly as much. The attention to detail, even with a few bits being slightly stiff, awkward or contrived, was gorgeous and a joy to behold; the calibur of detail and fluidity is just excellent. <br /> <br />The music? If you're familiar with Nobuo Uematsu's work, you'll notice that the flavor of this soundtrack has his feel all over it. It's nicely done, with throwbacks in the form of remixes to several of the game's original tracks-and they're nicely done. Many of the original pieces to the movie are hot too-check out Divinity 1 and 2 (even if they DO sound a bit Star Wars-y). <br /> <br />The acting in both the original and the English versions are good, nothing stellar, but they do the job; which is disappointing. With some big name Hollywood actors attatched to the English version project, I expected better-but the viewer still has to understand the painstaking work that goes into dubbing a pice like this. It's hard. So the work done wasn't all bad. <br /> <br />The story-sigh. It was pretty uninspired compared to the game, but still-what 1 and 1/2 hour movie can pack in what a 50 hour videogame could? It was still entertaining and it tied up some loose ends, while at the same time introducing some interesting new folks into the fray. The characterizations for some of the more minor characters were pretty accurate, even if their turns in the movie were all too short.  <br /> <br />The action sequences...while over the top,portrayed many of the abilities of the characters in the game, which in turn makes the unrealistic nature of combat in the movie actually realistic in the context of the series. It was all fast and furious; even non-fans can appreciate the work that went into coreographing and animating scenes like this, and it all turned out very pretty. <br /> <br />All in all, a solid sequel, but not a great stand alone movie. As I stated about myself in the beginning-don't go into watching it with unreal expectations, and you'll enjoy this film. I, like others, look forward to future works from Square-Enix-if the leap from The Spirits Within to FFVII AC is any indication, their next movie shoud be FANTASTIC. <br /> <br /> <br />P.S. To Squenix- I, like many others I gather, would have rather had an actual game for a direct sequel ;p But I'll just enjoy the pre/sequels you DO have coming. <br />
B000001FN3|5.0|This 1976 debut is simply excellent and is unquestionably the finest recording to come out of the 1970s British symphonic pop scene.  In fact, I would place it on equal stature with the follow-up album and fan favorite I Robot (1977) even though I find Tales of Mystery and Imagination to be a more musically rich and satisfying recording.  As an added bonus, the album sets a few stories of tortured soul Edgar Allen Poe to music.<br /><br />The musicians on this album include the \\"Project\\" core of Alan Parsons (organ, projectron, EMI Vocoder, and additional vocals); David Paton (bass guitar); Stuart Tosh (drums); Ian Bairnson (electric and acoustic guitars); and Eric Woolfson (keyboards and additional vocals).  Various luminaries from the prog rock scene are present too including crazed vocalist Arthur Brown (he really belts out on The Tell Tale Heart), and keyboardist Francis Monkman (formerly with Curved Air).  Other notables from the rock realm include the band Ambrosia.  The vocalists (and there are several) are all pretty good and their voices work well with the particular track they were selected for.  Last but not least is Darryl Runswick on acoustic bass (Pavane - Part IV of The Fall of the House of Usher) - his playing is restrained, jazzy, and very well done.<br /><br />I should note that this album is not the same album that was released in 1976.  For starters, the cover is different (the stripe is new).  Furthermore, short segments of spoken word passages were contributed by Orson Welles and Alan overdubbed various keyboard parts along with remixing the entire album in 1987.  Although I never listened to the original album, I have to say that the changes Alan made are both tasteful and very organic sounding in a 1970s way (no 80's tone colors whatsoever).  Specifically, a new guitar solo was added to The Raven; Projectron and new analog sounding synths were added to The Tell Tale Heart; additional synth parts were added to the Cask of Amontillado; pipe organ parts were added to Doctor Tarr and Professor Feather; and new synth parts were added to the excellent Pavane (Part IV of the The Fall of Usher suite).<br /><br />My favorite tracks on the album include the opening instrumental Dream within a Dream; The Cask of Amontillado (the combination of the sweet melodies with Poe's macabre subject matter was a very clever idea); the lengthy instrumental suite The Fall of the House of Usher (which features a 7 minute overture played by the English Chorale Orchestra); and the dreamy pop song To One in Paradise.<br /><br />This version of the CD comes with all lyrics and a synopsis of the life of Edgar Allen Poe.<br /><br />All in all, this is an excellent debut by the Alan Parsons Project and is highly recommended to those looking to explore the British symphonic pop genre - which is an offshoot of progressive rock.

B000AMJG4Y|1.0|Sure it was visually stunning and more movies should be made like this, but the story went pretty much nowhere.  I am not a fan of the FF franchise, but one of my best friends is and loved FF7 the game, and even he agrees that this movie made absolutely no F'ing sense.
B000B8IA2G|4.0|Wish I could give a rating of 4.5 for this set of dvds. The episodes themselves are great to re-watch in one fell swoop, but it's the commentary by the various actors and directors and creators that make the set such a fun viewing experience.  Almost everyone involved in the show seems to have gotten involved in the act, and they are funny, witty, intelligent people who care about what they are doing and offer plenty of insights, and much naughtiness, in the commentary.       The show has improved greatly and really found its' footing, not to mention increasing the role of one of my favorites, Dr. Carson Beckett, decreasing others' parts and adding a wonderful new character, Ronan Dex, to the mix in season two, and I will definitely be buying that set when it is released.     This season one set is a highly recommended selection.  It strongly demonstrates the high potential this spinoff promised and has now begun to deliver.     Stargate Atlantis is a fun and interesting television series with very appealing actors, intriguing storylines, great villains, and high production values.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|Incredible. Yet again the chilis have taken a new direction, now combining the funk of BSSM, the psychedellia/alternative of Californication, and the pop-rock of By the Way into one massive album. Even elements of One Hot Minute are evident in \\"Readymade.\\" <br /> <br />Ranking this up to the others is too tough to tell right now. I'd probably still put BSSM and Californication above this effort, but then again those are classic top 500 albums. Maybe when the dust clears I'll get a better grip on where this lands, but for now, a great album a step below the previous mentioned.
0670034711|5.0|I just adored this audio book. Over the week I listened I had the greatest time. I had to write the author! To me Eat Pray Love is a perfect mix of serious life questions & humor. I love the way the author articulates the many things I've felt & didn't have words for. She organizes feelings & yearnings so clearly. She's so honest & vulnerable & courageous to take the trip let alone spend the time to tell us about it. What a personal risk. And gracefully she succeeds on all levels. I told her, Eat Pray Love is a masterpiece. You nailed it, the human experience, the intricacies of life, the inner workings of the heart, the tangled ramblings of the mind. Wow! Wow! Wow! Your book is a gift. It's a guide for people to save themselves from their own minds.\\" I've grown from Elizabeth Gilbert's experiences. Thank you, thank you Liz.
B00000D9TK|5.0|I'm french, and I'm enjoy you like this album, because many people thinks that you don't listen all song in french. And Jean Jacques Goldman is a big star in France, and he composes many beautyful song as \\"He doesn't see me\\" sing Sarah Brightman. If you search a beatyfull album of Jean Jacques, there is \\"Entre gris clair et Gris fonc\\", \\"En passant\\", \\" Chansons pour les peids\\", \\"Singulier\\" and \\"Pluriel\\" . And if you love very stong voice, ther's \\"Gang\\" with the song \\"L'envie\\" sing by Johny Hallyday.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Maybe every generation needs to re-invent Jane Austen for themselves. This  film interpretation of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" stresses the youthfulness of the characters. Elizabeth and Darcy look younger here than they were in the most recent dramatization that featured Colin Firth. I loved the rough and tumble look of the Bennett's home. It's a non-prissy look at life in the early 19th century. The film's expansive outdoor scenes were like a series of Bruegel paintings--the characters' romances became part of larger ongoing drama of rural life. McFayden's Darcy is refreshingly nerdy. He's a nice change from the usual drop-dead handsome Darcys (like Laurence Olivier and Firth). Knightly is equally refreshing as a tomboyish Elizabeth.<br /><br />This is the story of two intelligent young people cursed with embarrassing relatives. Elizabeth has an emotionally disengaged father, a vulgar mother who continuously puts her foot in her mouth and three out-of-control sisters. Darcy's aunt, Lady Catherine, is an ill-behaved snob whose rude behavior is worse than the whole Bennett family put together.<br /><br />This film really conveys the precariousness of the Bennett's financial and social situation more than other dramatizations. We can see why Mrs. Bennett's desperation to get her daughters married off isn't so crazy after all. As in all of Austen, there's a dark undertone to the story--the vulnerability of women who have no money or powerful social connections. Lydia's elopement with Wickham shows how swiftly a young woman can fall from respectability and the double-standard that lets the men involved go scot-free. Elizabeth's assertiveness and integrity stand out all the more given the limited choices she has in her life.
B0006399FS|5.0|For any U2 fan who believed that the Joshua Tree was probably the greatest album of the last 1/4 of the 20th century, this album is probably what you've been waiting more than 15 years for.  After a decade of almost unlistenable albums of pretensious overblown self-indulgence, U2 came back with a strong effort in 2000 with All That You Can't Leave Behind.  But this one surpasses all other U2 albums with the exception of the Joshua Tree.  'Vertigo' explodes off the CD and grabs you imediately.  But then 'Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own' contains a vulnerability Bono has never displayed before.  The Edge ramps up the intensity again to thrilling levels on 'All Because of You', while 'Original of the Species' has a unique sensibility without trying so hard to be 'orginal'.  Finally, 'Yahweh' closes this wonderfully balanced album, mixing Edge's lush guitars, Larry and Adam's inviting rhythms and Bono's haunting words and vocals into one of the most uplifting songs I've ever heard.  This is surely a welcome return for the most important band in the world since the early 80s.
B000F48CD8|3.0|As a big fan of Jack White and Brendan Benson, I've been looking forward to this album since they announced that they had been writing songs together.  I was a bit disappointed after the first spin.  It has grown on me a bit since.  An album that is only 10 songs can't afford any clunkers and here there are some.  If the album had maybe two more songs, it would have more going for it.  It has a rushed feel and with Jack White being involved that is not hard to imagine. <br /> <br />\\"Steady as She Goes\\" and \\"Hands\\" are both 5 star rockers.  \\"Broken Boy Soldiers\\" is all Jack and would not be out of place on the first White Stripes album.  He even uses some of the echo/distortion on his voice that is all over that album.  \\"Intimate Secretary\\" is pretty disappointing.  The lyrics are dumb and there is no real hook.  \\"Together\\" is a nice ballad.  The kind that Benson can churn out in his sleep.   <br /> <br />\\"Level\\" is good, but it's very minimal.  Just the same verse sung a few times with different combinations of White and Benson.  \\"Store Bought Bones\\" was the b-side to \\"Steady\\" and it sounds like it.  I was surprised it made the album since there is just not much to it.  Again, if the album had more tracks, it would have room for pit stops like these.  But at 10 tracks, you need a solid, well-crafted effort.  \\"Yellow Sun\\" is a winner all around.  One of my favorites.  \\"Call It a Day\\" has yet to do something for me.  No chorus or hook to make it memorable.  \\"Blue Veins\\" is a good bluesy Jack number.  One you wished was just a bit longer. <br /> <br />At 33 minutes, the album flies by, and when there are songs that don't quite grab you, the album goes by even quicker.  However it is a very enjoyable offering and one I will surely spin all summer long.  My hopes may have been too high for this one, but Jack and Brenden singing together is a joy you can find nowhere else.
B00005JOIH|5.0|As a tale of Israel's retribution agains the PLO following the Munich Olympic Massacre, 'Munich' is a top notch action/adventure movie.  However, the film doesn't stop with solid entertainment, there is more to it than that.  This is an empathetic story that details some of the risks involved with targeted assassination as a means of policy: both for the State, and for the Individual.  Eric Bana performs very well as the agent who falls deeper and deeper into a web of intrigue and death as he pursues his 11 names.  How will this affect his family, his wife and newborn daughter?  'Munich' explores all of these angles, and does so in an interesting and artfull manner.  Spielberg also asks The question: are the killings only to replace the terrorist leadership with more effective and ruthless men?  And even better, Spielberg never forces an answer on the audience, he leaves it up to you to think and discuss with your friends/family.<br /><br />All in all, a solid film well worth watching.  It will make you think, and keep you on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />The Special Edition comes with an extra disk that includes the usual documentaries, all of which are interesting, but I think I would have been just as satisfied with the Widescreen Edition that is about 10 dollars less expensive.
B00004RFFS|5.0|This movie is as good as they come. You got Tom Cruise in his best performance ever (it rivals his performance in Magnolia, but I think he's slightly better in Interview), and then you have Brad Pitt being just as good as Tom. Kirsten Dunst, however, is the most impressive talent in this movie. At such a young age, and lacking the experience of both Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt, regardless, she's in league with them throughout the entire movie (and perhaps outperforms them?). Antonio Banderas is also impressive. He may not look like Armand did in the novel (Armand looks like a boy, with auburn hair), but I think it's fair to say that this is the best acting performance I've seen from Antonio Banderas so far. Indra Ove gives us all one very memorable performance as a New Orleans prostitue (she's an underrated actress, and deserves more success because of her talent; I think she should be featured in more professional movies like this one).    The soundtrack composed by Elliot Goldenthal, is in perfect harmony with the settings, the characters, the events, and the entire timeline of this movie. Church choir in Latin is absolutely beautiful. I especially liked the \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\" cover at the end (Guns N' Roses, what a band).    This is one of my favourite movies of all time, and much of that is thanks to Anne Rice. She wrote the novel which this movie is based upon, and she also wrote the screenplay. I think she has a very unique beauty with words, and the English language in itself. I think she's the best author we have today, because she puts her heart and soul into her books. And that's something many authors fail to do (at least not as good as Anne Rice). I also love her \\"writer's voice.\\" It sounds very professional when you read her books.    Everyone in this movie deserves an Oscar--especially Anne for best screenplay.    I've read the novel, and I think it's fair to say that this is one of the few movies out there, which is actually better than the book (not that there's anything wrong with the novel).    Bottom line: this is how you make a vampire movie.
B000F48CD8|4.0|The Raconteurs are a \\"Super group\\" consisting of Jack White and members of the Greenhorns. They bring us a Jack White suddenly backed up by bas and keyboards. This doesn't mean we get an all new Jack White. Any fan of the White Stripes will enjoy this project. Jack White's distinct guitar work is still there, as is his elective songwriting.  Only Maggie is missing. So for the very first time Jack is working with a drummer that actually knows how to keep time. <br /> <br />The album is a nice throwback to the music of the late sixties and the start of the seventies. Super groups were a common occurrence back then. The Raconteurs is clearly inspired by bands of this era. Through out the record we get pieces of the Beatles, Led Zeppelin and the Cream. As such this is a welcome record. Jack White sounds loose and inspired and is clearly having fun. For this record Jack White dropped some of his White Stripes stylistics allowing him to sound more relaxed. Although the record is short, clocking in under 35 minutes, it doesn't really feature any weak moments. Broken Boy Soldiers is a really nice spring record. <br /> <br />Yet it isn't really special either. Somehow Broken Boy Soldiers doesn't live up to its expectations. Maggie may not be the world's tightest drummer; she does give the White Stripes some of its charm. The Raconteurs are somewhat lacking in this department, often sounding a bit common, predictable. Although Steady as She Goes is one of those irresistible summer hits it misses the eccentricity the songs of the White Stripes have. We'll probably be hearing it al summer but I'm not sure it will be around for the summer of 2007. There is no reason to pass this album by if you're a Stripes fan or if you're a sucker for good guitar bands, but Broken Boy Soldiers isn't the essential I hoped it would be.
B00005JLKN|4.0|This is a good thriller.  Anthony Hopkins is one of the top actors in the world because he is able to play very good characters and very evil characters with flare and a lot of believability.   That, in a nutshell, is what makes him such an excellent and compelling actor.  I would agree with this reviewer: <br />\\"The cast is top-notch, as one would expect from actors the caliber of Harvey Keitel, Emily Watson, Mary-Louise Parker, Philip Seymour Hoffman (Especially good as the loathsome Freddie Lounds..), etc. Edward Norton, Ralph Fiennes, and Anthony Hopkins are all spellbinding in their respective roles as Fed, Serial Killer, and Imprisoned Cannibal, and the actual depiction of the capture of Lector, as well as his infamous dinner party is a real treat.\\" <br /> <br />Fiennes was very chilling and his immense self absorption and egotism seemed very real on the screen.  These are not \\"lightweight\\" actors.
B000EQ4G5K|5.0|Rihanna has officially gave us a solid album..  Starting off with her #1 hit \\"SOS\\" which samples Soft Cell's hit \\"Tainted Love\\" Then \\"Kisses Don't Lie\\" a rock raggea track which is deffintely shows her interest in music.  \\"Unfaithful\\" undoubtly the best ballad, slow jam on the album truley amazing.

0385336691|5.0|Five HUGE Stars! A riveting read that kept me up until daybreak!! This thrilling Jack Reacher novel is loaded with suspense and action. Lee Child is one very gifted novelist, and my first Jack Reacher tale reveals the ex-Army CID agent as a believable, remorseless hero who has his human failings. The nice touch is that you never know if Jack is on the right track or will fail within a subplot of the story-line and that fact keeps us guessing all the time. And Child uses a great writing technique to highlight certain story elements, shifting gears, as it were.    The plot centers around the fact that there has been a kidnapping with an unusual twist, one that ramps up the concern of the despondent husband. Jack is hired to do what the police would normally do: to find some unusually adept kidnappers who are truly greedy, ruthless and very cunning. But Reacher is equally cold and calculating as the plot unravels. Who is behind this kidnapping? And is it tied to past events? Is Jack himself involved in some way? Who is the mysterious lady? Lee Child creates a wild, sometimes humorous, ride of a suspense novel that will mesmerize you. And then, the quirky ending with Jack using all of his physical and mental powers. In the extended ending, Reacher receives the ultimate compliment. Overall, Jack Reacher is one 'rugged hombre'! This is a tough, thought-provoking novel that has it's gory moments. I look forward to reading many more past and future Reacher novels. And Lee Child fans take note, Jack Reacher is coming to film. Highly Recommended. Five Suspenseful Stars!!

B000EGCITG|5.0|With her first single \\"Stupid Girls\\" peaking at #13 on the Hot 100..  Is the weakest song on the album..  \\"Who Knew\\" a great emotional ground breaking rock track that other artists inspire to record.. Same with \\"Long Way To Happy\\"  \\"Nobody Knows\\" a beautiful ballad same with \\"Dear Mr. President\\" ft the Indigo Girls.. with her bashing the president's wacky ideas.. Pink defintely went back to some great RnB/Dance tracks such as \\"Cuz I Can\\" \\"I'm Not Dead\\" \\"U & Ur Hand\\" and \\"Leave Me Alone(I'm Lonely). <br /> <br />Then my favorite tracks \\"Runaway\\" which put goosebumps down my back.. P!nk is back!  Then \\"Conversations With My 13 Year Old Self\\" is defintely the best track on the album.  <br /> <br />
B000301YY8|5.0|This album is really remarkable. Its one of the few albums where every song is great. I love being able to play track 1 and not having to worry about skipping songs because they are all really enjoyable to listen to.  <br /> <br />Its kind of hard to explain his style. He does emotional without being whiney, and he does catchy without selling out. It has pop-elements but its more than that.  <br /> <br />I am usually hesitant to try new artists because most music albums disappoint me - they'll have 2 or 3 good songs (the singles usually) and the rest are crap. I am a fan of industrial music/heavy metal, and I am not ashamed to admit that James Blunt has blown me away. <br /> <br />James Blunt is a very talented singer/songwriter with a lot of experiences to share. If you like Damien Rice, I think you will really like him.
B00005KHJM|2.0|*POTENTIAL SPOILER*  *POTENTIAL SPOILER*  *POTENTIAL SPOILER*  *POTENTIAL SPOILER*  <br /> <br /> <br />\\"The Wicker Man\\" is one of those somewhat obscure movies from many years back that has won over a devoted, some might even say rabid, cult following that most people usually feel a bit underwelmed by when they finally see it. <br /> <br />The plot, already outlined here, involves a police officer from Scotland who travels to a remote island to investigate the reported disappearance of a young girl.  While there the policeman, a devote Christian discovers that the inhabitants of this island still practice the pre-Christian religion on their ancient Celtic ancestors. <br /> <br />It is unquestionably an intriguing premise and one that could have really stirred thought and discussion over the notion of rigid theology and intolerance of religious fundamentalism (fundamentalism of ANY type as both the policeman and the islanders follow a rigid fundamentalist mindset) towards those of differing belief systems.  I sense that this is what the movie is striving to do, but unfortunately its execution is woefully uneven.  The acting, with an exception or two, isn't very credible, the effects are laughable (there is a scene in which a group of young women are supposed to be dancing naked around a bonfire and it is painfully obvious that they are all wearing leotards) and the film's title gives away the ending to anyone familiar with the alleged practices of the ancient Celts.  Much is often made by fans of the film of the movie's songs and they can add a certain flavor, but most of the time they come across as flaky folk wannabes that Donovon would have scoffed at.  The is much more compelling music that could have been used. <br /> <br />Still, having said all of that, I have to cut the movie just a little bit of slack for its originality and for making an effort at giving us something unique and different.  I was going to give it 3 stars, but I decided to dock it one star to counter act the reviewer from November of 2005 who does not actually review the film but rants against the forthcoming remake.  Having not seen the remake, he is hardly in any position to criticize it and by doing so he simply reminds of the degree to which this movies obsessive following have overrated it.
1573225517|5.0|Even if you're 110 years old if, while in your 20's, you had a relationship with a woman you will be able to identify with the protagonist in this book.<br /><br />Hornby nails the roller coaster ride of emotions that men experience when thoughts of long-term careers and relationships replace the seat of the pants, wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am thinking that got us this far.  To guide the reader through the change, Hornby provides fun, loveable and genuine male and female protagonists.  They are a couple that you know, or have known.  They wrestle with the same issues that you and your girlfriend did/do.<br /><br />But the difference between you and the characters in the book is that they are fascinating people and fall-down funny.  Couple them with a handful of other colorful characters, a universally appealing story line (boy meets girl, boy loses girl...kind of thing), and interesting settings and you've got the recipe for a book that will appeal to both men and women.<br /><br />A well-written, funny and engaging book with interesting characters and an appealing story line?  What more can one ask of a book?  If cleverly written fiction, warm characters and charming fiction is your gig, then this is your book.

B000F7OPCC|3.0|I suppose it's Harrison Ford's movie, but I would have liked to have seen more of River Phoenix in it. He was a serious cutie in his day, and I instantly thought this would be a great film to watch. But also, with all the hype surrounding The Da Vinci Code at the book, this movie features the Holy Grail, and I pretty much have NO idea what it is, so decided I might actually learn something for once from a film.<br /><br />I've always promised myself I'll never watch a Bond film. But in my head, Indiana has always been more macho than Bond and there was even a joke once that Bond was allegedly supposed to be Indiana's dad. Hence the reason why they bring in a former Bond (Sean Connery) to play his dad. \\"Junior!\\" (There's also a former Bond girl, Alison Doody.)<br /><br />To me, this is the best of the Indiana films so far. It's got a catchy storyline, pays more attention to characterisation, it's got some fantastic special effects, it's funny, and the rats gave me the creeps. Therefore, memorable. There's also one particularly memorable scene towards the end where the guy ages spectacularly fast, and was also the first all-digital composite. It's actually really creepy, and since I was scared of Christopher Lloyd's character in Who Framed Roger Rabbit, I had a major flashback to this. I'm easily scared!<br /><br />I'm starting to like Harrison Ford more now, than in the previous movies too. There's just something different than in the previous films, but it could have been the brilliant chemistry he had with his 'father' Sean Connery. How funny are these guys together? \\"Junior!\\" And then the revelation about his true name being Henry Jones, Jr. In the previous two films he has only been referred to as \\"Indiana Jones\\" and the variations. But it's only in the last minutes of this that it's revealed.<br /><br />If there's anyone old enough :) that remembers the TV show, The Young Ones, this also stars Alexi Sayle, who was a former star on that. And no I'm not old enough to remember it! But have had the 'pleasure' of watching it.<br /><br />Definitely the best of the Indy films, and worth watching.ld enough to remember it! But have had the 'pleasure' of watching it. <br /> <br />Definitely the best of the Indy films, and worth watching.
B00005JOVN|2.0|What is it with Wolfgang Peterson and water?<br /><br />Ladies and gentlemen, may I present the newest entry in the Greed Won Over Better Judgement Awards... And the winner is \\"Poseidon\\".<br /><br />Directed by Wolfgang Peterson, \\"Poseidon\\" is a completely unnecessary film. And it isn't a very good unnecessary film. Made because they have no original ideas and better special effects to display those ideas, Warner Bros. clearly wanted (needed?) a popcorn film to fill the multiplexes over the weekend. Someone suggested the 1972 film \\"The Poseidon Adventure\\" deserved to be remade (stop laughing, it happened.) and they called on Wolfgang Peterson to hammer out a special effects and action extravaganza. Apparently, Peterson has been typecast as the `Water' director; after \\"Das Boot\\", \\"The Perfect Storm\\" and now \\"Poseidon\\", he is clearly the guy to go to if your story involves water and your actors will get wet.<br /><br />But why was \\"Poseidon\\" remade? The 1972 film is remembered for two reasons; the ship overturns and Shelly Winters in an evening dress crawling through small passageways. Last year, a television movie was made; this time, a terrorist's bomb causes the boat to capsize and one of the survivors is a Homeland Security agent. How timely. So why is this version hitting the multiplexes? Money and more money. Studios feel like they have to release two or three big budget \\"tent poles\\" every summer. These films cost a lot of money and will (hopefully) bring in a lot of money and ticket buyers. Sometimes, they hit it big (\\"Spiderman\\"), other times; they lose (\\"Poseidon\\"). Before these big films begin playing, the studio will get to show one or two previews for some of their other big summer offerings, trying to win potential ticket buyers. Before \\"Mission Impossible III\\", Paramount included a preview for \\"Nacho Libre\\", a film I suspect cost about a third of Tom Cruise's salary alone. Before \\"Poseidon\\", we saw trailers for \\"The Lake House\\", a new weepy romance starring Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock (probably cost about a third of \\"Poseidon\\") and \\"Superman Returns\\" (which probably cost more, a lot more.) So, long story long, it's all about economics. The studios would rather spend $120 million on a special effects filled offering rather than finance a dozen Wes Anderson or Woody Allen films.<br /><br />For those of you that don't know... The Poseidon, a luxury cruise ship, is traveling across the Atlantic on New Year's Eve. Just as the guests reach one in the countdown, a `rogue wave', as the Captain (Andre Braugher, in probably the most thankless role of the film) later explains, catches the ship broadside, causing it to flip upside down. Many people die, but the survivors include Dylan (Josh Lucas), a gambler and former Navy man who was never happier than when he was broke, Robert Ramsey (Kurt Russell), a former fireman and the Mayor of New York and Richard Nelson (Richard Dreyfuss), a [...] architect who is trying to get over a bad breakup. The group also includes a single mom (Jacinda Barrett) and her `adorable' little boy, Jennifer Ramsey (Emmy Rossum, the musical \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\"), Richard's daughter and Christian (Mike Vogel), her boyfriend and new fianc&eacute;e. As soon as the ship capsizes, Dylan figures he can find a way out and this ragtag group of people follows him through various obstacles. Some of them will make it, some won't.<br /><br />Josh Lucas and Kurt Russell are both good actors and the only reason I can think of for their involvement is money. Why would they agree to make a film in water tanks, soaked to the bones during the entire day, when their characters have little, if any, character? This is the type of film where character development is done in quick, broad strokes. Anything we learn about them is learned through quick, off hand comments. \\"I was never as happy as when I was broke\\". \\"May dad was Mayor of New York when I was young\\". \\"That must've been great.\\" \\"It wasn't\\". Basically, the only way a film like this will help their careers is if it is a huge hit. The film doesn't require them to act particularly well, so it all comes down to money. And because the film cost so much, the likelihood of a huge hit diminishes.<br /><br />There are many reasons for newcomers like Jacinda Barret, Emmy Rossum, Mike Vogel and Freddy Rodriquez to appear in the film. Exposure, exposure and more exposure. They are at the point in their careers where any film will help, no matter how bad. Appearing in a multi-million dollar film of this sort can only help their careers. Who knows? It might even help them stay away from the slasher/ horror films so many actors of their age populate.<br /><br />Richard Dreyfuss? Just behind John Travolta for most career revivals, Dreyfuss' career could use a shot in the arm. Here he plays a [...] architect. You see, he's an architect so he can say things like \\"This ship isn't designed to survive underwater.\\" Presumably, an architect knows about these things. But then again, wouldn't anyone? He seems to be a `[...]' architect to be merely pathetic. At one point, he calls his ex-lover and leaves a voice mail. \\"I'm begging, aren't I?\\" At another point, he calls Freddy Rodriguez's character gorgeous. This happens as they are trying to traverse an upside down elevator shaft. I guess this is why his character has an ex-lover.<br /><br />For a moment, I thought Kevin Dillon's character Lucky Lou had been transported intact from the 1972 original. His character is so laughably over the top you will also cheer when he dies.<br /><br />As the story progresses, the already spotty dialogue degenerates further as we get statements like \\"There is no other way!\\" or \\"I can't do it.\\" \\"Yes, you can.\\" \\"The water is rising.\\" Yes, all serviceable, but because we know so little about the characters this dialogue only serves to make each person all the more two-dimensional.<br /><br />Yes, the special effects are impressive, when the ship is turning over, but after this point, the film looks like it was filmed in water tanks. The cast encounter a series of obstacles, all of which take place in closed, confined spaces. But because we know so little about the characters, it is difficult to care if they ever make it through the obstacle course alive.<br /><br />As in any disaster film, some of the recognizable faces will make it out alive, some won't. Some of the newer faces will make it out, some won't. But all will go on to appear in new movies and projects. Hopefully, much better new movies and projects.<br /><br />If \\"Mission Impossible III\\" represents the best a summer can offer, \\"Poseidon\\" represents the worst; a film made to showcase special effects with little attention to character or story. Thankfully, this remake seems shorter than the original. Everything seems to move a lot faster without Shelly Winters holding them back.eers is if it is a huge hit.

B000002MP2|5.0|i really dont care what people have to say about green day. one thing we all know is they are undeniable and this album is proof. i was 12 when this album was put out, and i still give it a listen every now and then. this is music that is simple, catchy, and fun. it covers every emotion and suits almost every background. if you are just startin to get in to green day buy this and kerplunk.
B000EULJLU|5.0|This album is incredibly rewarding, but the listener must be willing to invest a lot of time into it. There have been some initial negative reviews, and that is because on the first few listens, this album is not overly impressive.  <br /> <br />To a dedicated tool fan, on first listen it almost sounds like they've done nothing new. Unlike Lateralus, which on first listen mystifies, but intrigues, this album sounds somewhat trite. The production quality stands out, but the songs seem derivative, the riffs sound familiar, and there is little to grasp. <br /> <br />But then it hits you: I was wrong...This changes everything. <br /> <br />This album is nothing short of stunning. Consider the glasses and pictures the album comes with. If you can't figure out how to properly use the glasses, the pictures seem blurry and annoying. But once it comes together, you realize the artwork is incredible. That is a good metaphor for this album. Once it hits you, you realize how amazing these songs are. The six tracks that make up the core of this record are masterpieces. They are some of the most textured, nuanced, yet powerful songs you will ever hear. The supporting tracks are equally important; they are insturmental in their ability to carry the album, guiding it through its peaks and valleys, providing moments of more subdued beauty. <br /> <br />All in all, this album is more than worth the effort it requires. Take the time, and you will certainly be rewarded...
B000F48CD8|4.0|The Raconteurs may not be as eclectic as the White Stripes but with Jack White's fingerprints all over this supergroup consisting of White, singer/songwriter Brendon Benson and  two Greenhornes (Patrick Keeler and Jack Lawrence)comparisons are sure to abound. Benson and White have gone on the record to say that this is Detroit's answer to Nirvana's \\"Nevermind\\"; it's at least a couple of solid songs short of that lofty standard but for a debut album it certainly holds it's own. <br /> <br />Allready the group has had a name change forced upon them as there is a jazz band with the same name in Australia so they will be known as the Saboteur's downunder. That aside it has been smooth sailing for the foursome all whom have been doing exactly as they please in their musical ventures and yet managed to mesh together to the extent that you can sense everyone had their say in the way Broken Boy Soldiers sounds. <br /> <br />While all members of The Raconteurs may have been born equal, turns out that some are more equal than others. Because it's the songs that sound most like Jack that really soar: the piano/bass/cymbal heavy Blue Veins, or the astounding Broken Boy Soldiers far outshine the Benson penned jangle of Together or Call it a day. <br /> <br />Steady as she goes will garner a lot of airplay and is reminicent of sixties pop, it's also as catchy as the Bird-flu. This was the song that got the project of the ground when White and Benson got togther to write in Bensons attic. <br /> <br />If you heard Loretta Lynn's \\"Van Lear Rose\\" album then you will be familar with the Greenhorne's who Jack hired to work on that album, they also had/have the gig opening for the White Stripes. <br />Patrick Keeler plays like he want's to murder his snare and is a stark contrast to the drum-how-you-feel loseness of Meg that Jack is accustomed too. <br /> <br />In fact Jack sound's (and in publicity snippets he looks) as if he's having a ball and is a lot looser himself than the Jack White of late who broods onstage with the Stripe's. Maybe it's that he has freed himself from the self imposed white and red constraints of the Stripes, maybe it's because he like's hanging out with the boys for a change. He certainly seems to be invigorated and this can only bode well for future albums wether they be Stripes, Raconteurs or Saboteurs.
B000FIMG68|5.0|I don't understand how people can talk about a slimp. I guess some of you are so spoilt that they don't even know anymore when something this good is made. LOST has to be one of the most original, best written, well acted, suspensful,funny, scary series around...or that has ever hit TV. I agree that ABC basically messed up the pacing for the audience but don't blame the messenger, dude. I know this is goin to be part of my collection 100% eventhough I never buy DVD sets let alone of TV series...apart from the Sopranos...but thats's another story!!So don't listen to the loonies be your own judge!!Cheers!
B0000028UK|5.0|Much like contemporary Nirvana and their follow-up-to-a-masterpiece In Utero, Pearl Jam surprised many nonbelievers with Ten's follow up, 1993's Vs.

Vs. contains some of Peal Jam's most underrated tracks, with the mouthwatering 'Animal' and the band's version of `Eleanor Rigby,' `Elderly Woman behind the Counter in a Small Town,' leading the pack.  Many listeners make mistakenly state that Ten is the better album because it simply has more great songs than Vs.; they say that `Even Flow, Alive, Black,' and `Jeremy' simply out weigh `Daughter, Dissident' and `Rearviewmirror.'  To these uneducated listeners I simply say, \\"Listen to the rest of the album, you fools!!\\"  Where Ten has issues with the inconsistency bug and several filler tracks tacked on at the end of the album, Vs. shows a remarkable musical fortitude exemplified by developed, creative music throughout.  Really, compare the head-banging `Leash' and the drum monster `W.M.A.' to the likes of `Why Go' and `Oceans,' both overrated tracks padded by the awesome singles-trademark of a young band (at the time).  Vs. has mature, flowing songs that ultimately become better than the sum of their parts.  It's no wonder why it was the fastest selling album ever back in '93.  A must for any music-lover.  As much as I adore Vs., however, it does not receive my vote for the best album of '93 (Siamese Dream takes the crown, but Vs. would have gotten it in most years).

0307277674|4.0|Look, I am not going to knock the book too heavily, and i won't be the millionth guy to review it...I just have a question.<br /><br />Is this book style and substance over...substance?  It is a good book, it is a very good book.  It is not great. It is not the best book ever written, and no one EVER should say that it is, but it is very good.  The question is the story of Jesus and Mary so compelling that it actually shrowds the fact that this is not that great of a book.<br /><br />I think the subject matter is fascinating, the locations are amazing (I have been to a few), and the educational lessons are insightful...but the book...the actual writing...is it that good?  My answer is yes and no.<br /><br />To weave the story, to add the educational asides, to discuss those topics were tough to do, and even tougher to make interesting...this book could have easily been horrible.<br /><br />That being said...the dialogue is not that good. The story lapses into the ridiculous more than several times.  The hidden character was easily figured out.  The ending, the last 20 pages, are flat out horrible...but need to be read...force the reader to keep reading.  The substance is just too interesting...the writing is not.<br /><br />The substance of the story, the style of the story are great...the writing is just average at best.<br /><br />Still...I liked it...and I don't like myself for liking it.
B000000OSG|5.0|First of all, thanks to Doug for the preceding review, which is more eloquent than I will try to be here. The only thing I can add to his comments is: I like \\"My World\\"! I don't understand why everybody hates it, except that the hard-rock and hip-hop worlds were too separated in the 1990s. Now that that's out of the way, let me just say that I think \\"Use Your Illusion I & II\\" are essential statements of nineties rock, and of G N' R's contribution in particular. Trying to choose between \\"Appetite\\" and \\"Illusion\\" is like choosing between \\"Beggars Banquet\\" and \\"Exile on Main St.\\" -- that is, why are we choosing in the first place?? Enjoy both! The flaws of the \\"Illusion\\" set are well enough known ... they're overproduced, and there's a handful of crap songs (\\"Get in the Ring\\" prime among them). But, holy cow, when you're talking about CDs that include \\"Coma,\\" \\"Estranged,\\" \\"Civil War,\\" \\"Bad Apples\\" (one of the least-appreciated G N' R songs), \\"Locomotive\\" (the first minute-and-a-half of which deserves a place in the rock pantheon), not even mentioning \\"Bad Obsession,\\" \\"14 Years,\\" \\"So Fine\\" ... well, what has music done for you lately, anyway?
B000E8QVWY|5.0|Everyone pulled his weight in this production and the finished product shows it.  Cinematography, costumes, direction, casting, script, and, of course, the music...This is the kind of film everyone ever involved in motion pictures aspires to create. <br /> <br />Joaquin Phoenix can actually sing quite well.  I understand he doesn't sound EXACTLY like the late Johnny Cash.  Does anyone?  Joaquin's look and careful gestures brought a very genuine interpretation of the celebrity into the film.  Reese Witherspoon is no less compelling as his partner and love interest June Carter.   <br /> <br />This biopic provides us with the bittersweet details of Cash's personal life, and it's a tale worth telling with a touch of drama here and there.  Cash's search for identity and self-fulfillment is a journey anyone could understand and the mistakes and bad judgements he makes along the way prove his own humanity.   <br /> <br />Cash and Carter are examples of what real Christianity and faith are about.  Rather than make pretenses of superiority, they made their mistakes and still kept trying to be better people.  When Cash brings his life together you want to clap for him like the hero he is. <br /> <br />Watch this film, even if you think Cash's music is the worst you've ever heard.  This is the tale of a truly human hero.   <br /> <br />
B00005PJ8O|5.0|This excellent film is memorable for Patton's speeches as much as his actions. Who could forget them? He said: \\"All the world loves a winner, and will not tolerate the loser...When you were young, who did you admire the most?...the fastest runner, the toughest boxer\\". Patton's grasp of the Russians' imperial intentions was legendary, and one wishes that he had been President instead of Roosevelt. The newspapers could not see this, and merely attacked Patton for \\"Insulting our Russian allies.\\" Had Patton ruled, perhaps Poland and the other eastern European nations would not have been betrayed to the Soviet Union. Who could forget the scene where he looks with disdain upon the Russians dancing on the table, and who calls one of his Russian counterparts an SOB?
B000E8NQUE|5.0|The 5.1 mix is great...the music is great...HOWEVER, my Pioneer player only plays the SACD part and then stops.  The cd part has to be played from the menu.  They could have made the whole cd an SACD...weird how some companies do this sort of thing.  Don't let that inconvenience stop you from buying this.  The packaging is fabulous and the songs are unbeatable.  Buy it!!!
B000002C1W|5.0|If you go through some of the other reviews for this album, you can point out those who side with Roger Waters and those who side with David Gilmour. Setting aside Waters exit from the band and Gilmours song writing abilities, I have come to thoroughly enjoy this album.     As said by a reviewer above, this album is underrated and underappreciated. I suggest to all Pink Floydians that they give this a try without comparing it too much to Floyds past.    Gilmour and crew deserve a chance. AMLOR manages to capture the essence of Pink Floyd nicely without Waters involvement.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Ok, I think the problem is you people are too used to a regular cd.. You pop in the cd, listen to it from track one to the final track and then rate it on each individual track... wrong answer.. <br />Did you pay attention to the packaging? The stereoscopic images are a clue.. here's a hint. Look at the track names for the \\"ambient sounding\\" tracks. Wings for Marie (PT 1) 10,000 days (Wings PT 2) And Viginti Tres - which is Latin for 23, 23 is the universal number for synchronosity (23 male chromosomes, 23 female chromosomes) = 46 = a fetus.. Play all three tracks at the same time. T H E Y  M E S H <br /> <br />Its like listening to an 8 piece band playing beautifully, preferably on a surround sound system since it will unlock the true 3D feeling of the music. <br /> <br />In short, stop just listening to music and pay attention, open your minds to something new, dont just settle for mainstream anything, allow yourselves the treat of freeing your mind to explore the possibilities.. thats all this music is about.
B00005JOVN|4.0|This is a wonderful and dramatic remake of the 1972 film with Gene Hackman. I saw The Poseidon Adventure for the FIRST time in my life last summer.<br /><br />I found this new remake to be more gorey and action-packed than the first one.<br /><br />Question: What WOULD happen if a full size luxury cruise liner capsizes? I suggest you hold on tight!<br /><br />Thank you.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|F*cking unreal album.  Amazing lyrics on top of everything else.  Incredible depth that you begin to see once you really get to know the album track for track.      Anyone taking the reviewer below who gave this one star even remotely serious should probably click on the \\"see all my reviews\\" tab next to his name.  This guy is a joke. The Eagles and Dwight Yoakam???  Get real.  I'll respect someones negative review of this album when a) they have good taste in music and b) they dont mention disliking this album for reasons other than the music (band member's not being on dope, getting older, etc...)    Notice how nearly every negative reviewer on here complains about the band \\"growing up\\" and \\"being sober\\", amongst other things completely irrelevant to the music.  And I stress this because I truly believe that every negative review I've read on here is not liking this album because of other things that theyve gotten into their heads.  LISTEN TO THE MUSIC.  Don't pay attention to whats happening in the lives of the band members.  Why do you even care???  If anything, it jades your perspective of the music.  I've always been surprised how people can get so involved in the personal lives of musicians.       I challenge you to ask yourselves this question:    What would you think of this album if you were to play it having never heard a Chili Peppers song before in your life?
B000EMGAOY|5.0|First of all, I have to admit I bought this album expecting it would sound again like Mother's Milk and BSSM. According to the previews and the first single 'Dani California' that would have been the case. Like most of you already know however, this is not the case. <br />BUT BUT BUT : if you play this album 2 or 3 times in the order it was conceived you'll be rewarded with something very beautiful. And that beautiful thing is not only the music but also the knowledge that rising above your own prejudices will give you a lot in return ! <br />If it's good to your earhole, let it salvage your soul !  <br />And don't bother about who is the artist and what that artist is supposed to be playing.  <br />The Red Hot Chili Peppers used to be the Masters of the Funk, and now they are the Masters of great Melodies, and there's nothing wrong with that.  <br />And although their music isn't the same, they themselves remain the same, and that you can hear in the greatness, the subtlety and integrity of every song on this classic double album ! <br />
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I'm a huge P&P fan, and this movie absolutely did it justice! Be sure to read the book first - they skip over a bit and it's a little hard to follow if you haven't read the book. If you have read the book, this highlights all of the best parts! I've even seen the old A&E Colin Firth movie and fully approve of the shortened version. P&P fans, definitely check this out!
B00005JOWR|2.0|Let me preface this by saying that I didn't like \\"Sideways\\". I hated \\"Sideways\\". I wanted my money back. I wanted Sandra Oh to suffer for making me suffer throught that film. However, a lot of people liked \\"Sideways\\". A lot of people also like \\"Prarie Home Companion\\" and think that \\"Dilbert\\" is among the great mines of caustic wit. These are the people who will enjoy \\"Thank You for Smoking\\". For everyone else, I've written several good reasons for you to avoid this movie.  <br /> <br />1) The film doesn't work as satire because it's too unfocused and tries to make everyone happy. Why not a scating rebuke of the tobacco industry and leave it at that? Why make everyone and everything (and I do mean everything) a target? Don't believe me? Allow me to whip out my \\"Easy Target\\" checklist - TYFS has evil corporations, silly feel-good anti-freedom liberals, politicians, Hollywood kiss-up Assistants, out of touch Left-coast new age \\"industry types\\", smarmy lobbyists, whiny intellectuals, and finally THE MEDIA!!! Those unethical journalists who only pretent to love you until they get the story. Like that guy who *said* that he worked for the Penny Saver and told me that he loved me until. . .nevermind. <br /> <br />2) The tobacco industry, its influence, and how it's evil? Really? Why not a satirical piece about how we stole land from the indians? Or maybe a satire about the Kennedy Administration? Or the Iran-Contra affair? Probably because they aren't timely and people wouldn't care - and good satire (espescially when it isn't cleverly couched in a more metaphorical context) needs to be timely, even in the case of a film that deals with events past - the subject matter itself needs to be timely (i.e. Three Kings, Barbarians at the Gates). Which is why The Daily Show works so well now, but old episodes (say from 7 or 8 years ago) are as funny as trip and fall down a long, unfunny staircase. This movie just felt stale and its satirical choppers, therefore, had no bite. Whatremained was: <br /> <br />3) Postmodernism - postmodernism, or the grating self-awareness of watching and, in the case of Mr. Eckhart, being in a movie coupled with overdose levels of irony and the big pat on the back to the audience that \\"you guys all get it. If you laugh at the movie, you get it. You know that corporations are bad and evil and, unlike every character in this film, you are a young, hip, aware, educated moviegoer who is savvy enough to figure it out\\". Postmodernism makes you feel good for wasting your life in front of a television or knowing anything at all about our culture. Specifically, this film (if you think about it) was fairly devoid of plot - I mean, when you think about it, its all right there in the trailer. In other words, completely by the numbers (but by the numbers of other films that share the same basic structure - i.e. company man who realizes that there are things more important than his evil,evil career helping save \\"The Man\\") to the point that it lazily doesn't even bother playing out the protagonist's redemption. Rather, you get the following: freeze frame on A.E. at that critical moment followed by dialogue: \\"I bet you think I took the job and the money, I didn't. Some things are more important\\". Cut to shot of his son (A.K.A. creepy child from that Nicole Kidman movie where he claims to be her dead husband) riding in car. In fact, there's no enlightenment in this age of Truth commercials and anti-corporate flag waving. We get it, corporations are bad. They want our money and don't care about us. But a movie about a tobacco lobbyist who's all smarm and teeth. Sweet baby jeebus, it's one Leslie Neilsen away from a spoof. <br /> <br />The reason the film worked is because you've seen it before in its other incarnations. Which isn't a crime - a lot of movies do that. But I have a tendency to not call out the ones that do it well. This had a few well placed jokes, but it didn't have any teeth. I didn't leave feeling enlightened, and didn't feel that A.E. was some kind of power lobbyist. For example, that he won over a Senate hearing with the line \\"High cholesterol kills more people than smoking, shouldn't we have that label on cheese\\" would, if presented as argument in a real senate committee, draw raised eyebrows and the simple counter \\"cheese isn't directly related to the deaths of its customer base and, if you check the facts, smoking is a large factor in cases of high cholesterol\\". But in the film, which has been written, we take for granted that A.E. is a wunderkind Svengali snake-oil salesman who can convince ANYONE of ANYTHING, despite the fact that he only debates people whose couldn't form a counter-argument to genocide. It's like trying to sell me on someone being the greatest boxer in the world, but they only fight old women and four year-olds. Don't just tell me the guy's the world's greatest arguer - show me. Have him convince me of something other than the laziness of the screenwriter. <br /> <br />4) If Katie Holmes was set on fire she couldn't convincinly play a person on fire.  <br /> <br /> <br />
0062502182|1.0|Really , Really juvenile stuff . i`ve heard of a fairytale similar to this one when i was young , in india . at least that was over in 6 lines & never pretended to unfold deep truths .low grade crafting & rehashed theme . it inspired me .. to tear up the book .
B000EULJLU|5.0|Well, here it is.  It has finally come.  This album is Tool in a nutshell.  They are one of the very few bands left who is uncorrupted by mainstream media, and the public eye.  This album isn't for us, we didn't write this album.  This album is for the members of Tool.  They want people to listen to this only if they want to hear it.  They don't want people coming on here, and bashing it.  That isn't right.   <br />In reference to this album, this is an amazing album.  It could possibly be the best of the year.  And maybe so far this decade.  It's music at it's finest.  \\"Vicarious\\" is a 7 minute revision to Lateralus.  If you liked that album, this fits right in.  \\"Jambi\\" has a catchy riff and the lyrics are just insane.  If you actually listen to what Maynard is saying, you'll be impressed.  The next two tracks are what make this album great.  Wings part 1 and 2 are 17 minutes of what makes Tool the band Tool.  These 17 minutes are why they are a band.  They don't want you to look at this as a collection of songs, but 77 minutes of song, straight up.  That's why the songs mesh together.  The rest of the album is extremely well done, with \\"Right in two\\" being the possible single.  Altogether, you're supposed to listen to this album in 77 minute fragment, think of it as just one big long song.  And it's Tool, so it doesn't disappoint.  You have to forget about the present, and listen to this and let your mind wander, because the guys from Tool wouldn't have it any other way.  They want this album to be something that encourages you, makes you cry, makes you laugh, they want this to be something you never forget.  And, to tell you the truth, I don't plan on writing this album off anytime soon.....
B000EMGAOY|5.0|So the much hyped and anticipated new Chillis album is here. After months of teasing everyone with how good this double album is gonna be the verdict is in. Anthony and the boys have delivered their ultimate masterpiece.  In fact, i've never heard Anthony, Flea, John and Chad in better form.  Stadium Arcadium features a lot of sounds from their past two albums (By the Way, Californication) and a lot of funk grooves that can be found in their earlier albums (Blood Sugar Sex Magic, Mothers' Milk).    \\"Dani California\\" is a fitting opener for the album, followed by the sing-a-long Snow (Hey Oh), the funky \\"Charlie\\" and the slow pop of \\"Stadium Arcadium\\". \\"Hump De Bump\\", \\"She's Only 18\\" & \\"Slow Cheetah\\" keep up a slow-mid tempo until the thumping \\"Torture Me\\", the smooth pop of \\"Strip My Mind\\", \\"Especially in Michigan\\" and \\"Cmon Girl\\" take you back to the Californication days. \\"Warlocks\\" is a fine funk song and \\"Wet Sand\\" and \\"Hey\\" are great examples of the maturity of that Anthony and the boys have grown to become. The latter in particular because it has a bit of a jazz taste to it.    The second disc, entitled \\"Mars\\" is probably the heavier of the two. Like \\"Jupiter\\" the CD starts off strongly with the pop/rock of \\"Desecration Smile\\". John Frusciantes' backup vocals are particulary special in this one. \\"Tell Me Baby\\" is another mid tempo song before the much publicised \\"Hard to Concentrate\\" which is of course, a song Anthony wrote for his mate and RHCP's bassist Flea right before he got married. The hand clapping Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh's of \\"21st Century\\" make this track the standout for mine, a pure stadium tune. \\"She Looks to Me\\" & \\"Readymade\\" are another 2 very good mid tempo songs before the very Pink Floyd-esque ballad \\"If\\". \\"Animal Bar\\" \\"So Much I\\" & \\"Storm in a Teacup\\" are sounds directly from the 'ol days of funk/rock/rap/reggae before we get to the very experimental 'We Believe\\". \\"Turn It Again\\" is definitley the flagship rock song of the opus, and with good cause, it's great. And Frusciante's guitar playing is spine tingling. The last track \\"Death of a Martian\\" has Keidis try a little Henry Rollins spoken word to it. Although most of it is jibberish you do realise it's the chillis after all.    In summary this is the best album this year so far, and it's going to take an extroadinary effort to relinquish Stadium Arcadium off that title for mine. I have owned this for dead on 2 weeks and it's still in my CD player, in my car, on my PC and more importantly, in my head. Don't believe the detractors that this is overblown and most are fillers. This album would NOT have been better as a one disc. If that was the case a lot of the gems may not have seen the light of day.    And we would have been poorer for it.    Good on you boys, you delivered.
B000002897|5.0|<br />If you don't like grunge, don't worry. (But what is grunge, really? Guess it depends on who you ask). Labeled a grunge band because of the whole Seattle deal, this band was very, very interesting.  They were obviously the least known and least successful of the slew of Seattle bands that emerged from 91 - 94.  But, in my opinion, they were one of the absolute best. While they didn't really have a grunge-ish sound, they looked every bit the part with flannel shirts, matty, mangy hair, and the undesirable, \\"badly over-due for a bath\\" look.  <br /> <br />This album was released in 1992 with very little fan fare.  And, if it hadn't been for the mother of all soundtracks (Singles), the world beyond Seattle might not have ever known who these guys were.  What a shame that would be. This album is hands down one of the top 15 best, most complete albums I've heard. The lyrics are strong. The music is stronger. And Mark Lanegan's vocals are absolutely amazing (I simple refer to his vocals as, \\"Whiskey Smooth\\").  <br /> <br />While the entire disc is extremely solid, I highly recommend, \\"Dollar Bill\\", \\"Shadow of the Season\\", \\"Troubled Times\\", \\"Winter Song\\", and \\"No One Knows\\". In fact, \\"No One Knows\\" is one of the best songs you'll ever hear by any band. <br /> <br />If you don't have this disc, buy it. You'll be glad you did.
B000002JS6|5.0|Released in 1980 at the time when disco was dead and punk was in, this is, by far, AC/DC's best recording.  Who would have thought that \\"You Shook Me All Night Long\\" would be one of the most popular tunes played at dance clubs?  Yes, I can freely admit that I felt up some of my best female ass while shakin' it to that one! <br /> <br />By the way, in case you never noticed before, you can always tell the name of an AC/DC song because nine time out of ten, it's the LAST line that it closes with.  Think about it.  You know I'm right.
0060934700|3.0|I feel like now that I am a veteran reader of Gaiman books that I enjoyed this much more than I would have if I was a newcomer to such works.  Some stories I could have done without, but some I really enjoyed.  In fact, I enjoyed these few stories so much that it made the entire book worth reading. <br />Goldfish Pool and other Tales <br />Babycakes <br />and the last story about the angels, etc. <br />Strangely, what I loved most about this book really isn't the stories at all.  It is the beginning where he lists each book and gives a paragraph, a page, or sometimes more about how the story came about.  I found this deeply fascinating and it really gets you into the stories.  I read each of these notes before and after each tale.  You will enjoy this if you are a Neil Gaiman fan for sure, but if you are new to Gaiman I recommend that you read American Gods, Neverwhere, or Stardust before attempting this compilation of short stories.
B000B7HZXM|1.0|I think Rod Stewart is causing Billie Holiday to turn in her grave...Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughn or how about Mark Murphy...all great vocal stylists. If you start here you may get the wrong idea that this what these songs are supposed to sound like...NO!!! <br />Go buy Billie Holiday with Lester Young...
B000E8NQU4|3.0|I was under the impression that this disc, like Days of Future Passed, was going to be multi-channel. As mentioned elsewhere, this is a stereo-only SACD. The disc menu on the player shows only a 2-channel area, no multi-channel. The Days album is multi-channel. If you look in the included booklet on page 13, it even says \\"5.1 Surround Sound mix manipulated from the original Quadraphonic Masters..\\" so I'm very bummed about it. I thought maybe I got a different disc, but after reading other comments here, I guess we just got robbed on this one. <br /> <br />I want to get the rest, but now I'm hesitant about the other 3 albums. I was really looking forward to these. Five stars for the music, but lose two for stereo only.
B000002UBB|5.0|This album provides an outstanding variety of music styles by a multi-talented artist, and is likely one high point of his career.  Many of the items on this selection are recognized as being among his greatest hits. <br /> <br />An organ instrumental \\"Space Intro\\" serves as a connecting lead into the second track \\"Fly Like An Eagle\\", perhaps the best-known composition in all of Steve Miller's career.  This album-oriented song is marked by organ accompaniment to his mellow plea for fulfillment of people's basic needs for food, clothing, and shelter.  Throughout the song, the organ seems to increase its volume and in the end, climbs the scales repeatedly, then tails off and connects into the following track, \\"Wild Mountain Honey\\".  In this song, organ frills and light drum tapping serve as a backdrop to Steve's vocals.  These first three tracks are sort of a trilogy beginning of this album. <br /> <br />The subsequent songs reveal the diversity in styles of this singer.  Folk guitar can be heard in the rapid strumming of \\"Serenade\\" and in \\"Take The Money And Run\\", a story of a man and woman trying to rob some cash.  Another folk song is the remake of the late Sam Cooke's love ballad \\"You Send Me\\".  One rock 'n' roll number is \\"Rock N Me\\", a memorable piece with a hint of southern blues similar to Roy Orbison or Creedence Clearwater Revival.  Then, there is the country-sounding \\"Dance Dance Dance\\", a good choice for down-to-earth, backyard parties. <br /> <br />The most prominent of this artist's talents is his hand for blues.  The second of two instrumentals, \\"Blue Oddessy\\", with smooth organ that is soon joined by a harmonica and staccato guitar, leads into a blues ballad \\"Sweet Maree\\".  Although limited in lyrics, the harmonica and guitar provide the focal point here.  The other blues number is the well-known \\"Mercury Blues\\", a poetic wish about a special car.  This song was so popular, it was later remade by another artist using a different style. <br /> <br />Therecord ends with the gentle track \\"The Window\\", the third song that contains fancy organ accompaniment, a style seemingly unique to this artist.  This song serves as a finale to this album, with a winding down of volume and tempo.
B00005B4GU|3.0|its Radiohead, so it cant be that bad.  However, if you compare this album to other works, this one is much weaker.  There are a few good songs of course, but a lot of it is filler.  They worked so hard to redefine thier sound on Kid A and they did a wonderful job and created a stunning album.  Some may find this album more accessible than Kid A but i dont think it is nearly as progressive and lacks the vision that is so evident in Kid A.  Some called Kid A too 'artsy'... all i have to say is get over it.  I dont understand why people get so uncomfortable when they hear something different.  They shouldnt put out a similar album every time.  Listen to Top 40 if you want more of the same.
B000065AQU|5.0|There hasn't been a band that rocks this hard since old Metallica. I love their style. They have a unique sound which combines Armenian influences in their guitar riffs and great vocal variety. Their is also a humor to all of their songs which I find very refreshing. If you like metal and music that rocks give this a try. S.O.A.D. Rules!
B000E1YVZU|5.0|Right from the opening number you are pulled in.  Toally exciting.   I enjoyed it more than the live show!
B00008GKEG|5.0|The Beatles were/are the greatest band in rock/pop music history.  Their catalog stands alone at the top in the history of the genre.  This set of DVDs tells their story from the beginning to the end.  How they met, how they developed their style, who influenced them, who they influenced, what happened to end their partnership, and where they went from there.  If you love this band, as most of us in the 50+ age group do.  If you're younger but have been exposed to them through your parents or grandparents.  Or if you're just interested in how it all happened.  You need to get this set and relive the story of the one and only Beatles.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|I love Buble's sound.  First time I heard this album was in a movie theater before the previews and had to have more.  A smooth ride.
B000EULJLU|5.0|I cant believe this is getting bad reviews! This is music that will stand the test of time. Have you heard the new Chili Pepper and Pearl Jam? Sure, they're pretty good, but they cannot compare to Tool. This is incredible music, I believe it is one of the best hard rock albums ever released.
B000AP04OM|5.0|The sound of music should be a classic in every home collection. This will be entertaining to children for all time.

B0006399FS|2.0|Why is this band even relovent anymore? I mean if you reach an age where you want to mail it in fine, but don't expect us to buy it.
B00005JOYA|4.0|\\"Silent Hill\\" may not be for everyone. Certainly if you're a fan of the video games you should check out it out. But if you demand 100% cohesive Point A-to-Point B-to-Point C storytelling and plotting, this may not be for you. <br /> <br />I like it not because it's totally original or different, but it does draw from different sources than other movies, particularly \\"Jacob's Ladder.\\" Some people have gone so far as to call it a rip-off. I disagree. \\"Jacob's Ladder\\" is a fine movie and more movies should be finding innovative ways to borrow from it. <br /> <br />Some of the acting is indeed wooden, which is why I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5. But that doesn't kill the movie. It's beautifully rendered and a nasty treat for the eyes and ears. My advice is to approach it not expecting the conventional narrative forms we find in many horror movies but as a \\"Hellraiser\\"-ish assault on the senses with some neat imagery that wouldn't be out of place in the Nine Inch Nails video \\"Closer.\\"
B000EHSVQE|1.0|of double (and more) dipping.  What's next, ND-The Director's Cut??
B000EMGJM2|5.0|I L-O-V-E T-H-I-S A-L-B-U-M!!! It is so funky, so lyrical...so SEXY. In the African American vernacular I'd like to say that--\\"Van Hunt is starting to smell hisshelf\\". *-) I LOVE the concept of the whole album even better than the first. It's as if you're seated front row & center watching a cinematic version of a casual one-night stand that evolved into an intense love affair between lovers only to run its futile course. How can you not fall in love with such funky bass licks that O-ooze in a song like \\"Priest or Police\\"? Or how can you not help but smile when you hear the playful \\"cat-and-mouse\\" lyric in \\"Suspicion (She Knows Me Too Well)\\". Without that central theme of the rise and fall of a romance, I can see why people would not appreciate this album because musically it's everywhere --more so than the last album. You have 70's soul & funk, 80's punk rock & pop, all rolled into sixteen(tight)tracks. Wasn't nobody expecting THAT in his sophmore release. But one should have at least expected something slightly different--just revist the first album. Undoubtedbly he will be compared to Prince but to be honest I think this brother is funkier--sorry your Highness. It is a real treat to hear all the musical influences of an artist who isn't ashamed to pull up the roots of the musical tree that houses artists like Curtis Mayfield, the Funk Brothers, David Bowie, Ohio Players, Brothers Johnson, Sly & the Family Stone,The Time, just to name a few. My man, Mr. Van Hunt is having fun and I am thrilled to be a part of the ride. And if he's ever in your town performing, you don't want to miss him. He gives an awesome show--enough to want you to pull your red boa out of the closet!
B0007OASII|5.0|All I can say is that it is far ahead of anything they've ever done before; and Fourth Legacy was great in its own right.  Each album since Khan took over vocals has gotten better and better!  This was my best album purchase last year, hands down.  I can not wait for the next album.
0451526384|5.0|My sister had been raving about Persuasion, but after reading a few of Austen's books, I was very relunctant to read it.   When I had to read something for English class, I chose Persuasion--hoping I wouldn't be bored out of my mind.  Shortly, I was drawn into the world of the heroine: Anne Elliot, and could hardly put the book down!  Although Persuasion is predictable, it is, in my opinion, one of the best books ever!
B00005JO9J|5.0|This is a heart felt wonderful show everyone should get a chance to watch. The actors are supurb and the first episode you watch you are hooked. cOMEDY IS ALSO NOT RARE. I loved this and everyone should watch it.
B000FIMG68|5.0|I avoided watching \\"Lost\\" weekly, in part because of the pan and scan, in part the commercials, and in part because it did not run week to week for large parts of the year. More than any other television drama I have ever seen, it is meant to be seen in marathon chunks as a very long film. So this issue is very welcome. <br /> <br />In a drama with such a large arc, the second act (in this case taking a year) is the toughest to get right. It can't be as surprising as the first without violating the story, and we know enough now to catch any mistakes. They have pulled it off. The acting, cinematography, writing are all as good as the story unfolds. I expected more of a dropoff.  <br /> <br />Two questions I continue to ask: where is the monster? And why is there no gay character or couple in a cast that is nearly a hundred? It is not an odd observation, it is as odd as if there were no black, Asian or Hispanic character, or no one over the age of 35. Perhaps it is a plot point to be revealed in the future, though that seems unlikely. In a work as brilliant as \\"Lost\\" it is a strange omission. <br /> <br />As with season one, the most brilliant sequences are the flashbacks.  <br /> <br />It would be wonderful of the casting in \\"Lost\\" - of talents not names - became hugely influental, but I've been punching that particular number into the culture every hour or so for years with no effect.
B000ENWKN8|2.0|I am very reluctant to listen to the radio because there is really nothing good on it. So needless to say I had not heard the single \\"Foxy Foxy\\". I figured it's Rob Zombie, it's gonna rock. All I can say is that Rob fell flat off his educated horse on this one. The songs for the most part are not heavy. His vocals, while sounding more old school Zombie, still come across as weak to me. Not to mention he has John Lowery from Marilyn Manson fame on guitar, but even John's solo album \\"Vertigo\\" is overflowing with hard driving guitar / solo shredding on some of the tracks. So I will let the blame fall on Rob since the band is more than capable of rocking out. It is just and uneventful weak release that he should've just made another movie instead of recording. The lack of a Parental Advisory Sticker should've sent up a red flag to me but oh well. If you must have some Rob Zombie music, buy any other release and avoid this one.
B000002JPA|5.0|Images and Words is Dream Theater's second album and the first with vocalist James LaBrie, who is a HUGE upgrade over original vocalist Charlie Dominici (whom they only did one album with, their first).  Images and Words shows Dream Theater showing their chops with great songwriting and production.  Pull Me Under, Take the Time, Learning to Live, and the fantastic Metropolis Pt. 1: The Miracle and the Sleeper, are great examples of this.  Great written songs with instrumental muscle to back it all up.  Surrounded and Live Another Day are kinda cheesy in an early-1990s metal sort of way but both work really well.  This is *the* DT album to start with if you want to get into them.  Just great stuff.
B000002JKA|5.0|Awake, DT's 3rd album, is very dark and brutal...the heaviest album they made until the back to back metalfests of 2002's Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence and 2003's Train of Thought (two EXCELLENT ALBUMS!).  Awaks is devoid of the long songs of Images and Words...rather than three or four 12 minute songs, we get a bunch of 6-7 minute songs here.  The opener, 6:00, is heavy and has James LaBrie singing in a snarly style we hadn't heard from him up to that point.  It's followed by Caught in a Web, which is once again heavy and dark.  The best songs on this album are those two, the Mind Beside Itself trilogy (Erotomania, Voices, The Silent Man), The Mirror, Lie, Scarred, and the song I saved for last, the creepiest song on the album, Space-Dye Vest.  This song was written by original keyboard player Kevin Moore, who left the band after this album.  It's a really dark, heavy (atmosphere-wise), atmospheric piece with strange sound effects, samples, and vocal processing.  The lyrics are rather haunting and dark, too.  A great closer to the album, and a song the band refuses to play live.  All in all, this is an excellent album, and with Images and Words, would make a great starting point to those wanting to get into the majesty that is the music of Dream Theater.
B000021XS0|5.0|Metropolis Pt 2: Scenes From a Memory is a \\"sequel\\" to the excellent song \\"Metropolis Pt. 1: The Miracle and the Sleeper\\" from DT's second album, Images and Words.  This album, however, fleshes out the concept of the original song into an album-as-murder-mystery concept album.  If you're a fan of good prog, like I am (Rush is one of my all-time favorite bands) you will love this album from the opening, which starts off with some dialogue and merges into a pretty acoustic song before seguing into an AWESOME overture, Overture 1928.      One of DT's strengths, like Rush, is their powerful, emotive lyrics that can speak to you on a level few bands (notably the Beatles) can.  This is true of this album, which combines moments of hard rock and metal virtuosity (Overture 1928, the Dance of Eternity) and pastoral beauty (Through Her Eyes, The Spirit Carries On) seamlessly, sometimes in the same song (one of my favorites, the excellent Beyond This Life).  The story itself is pretty cool...I won't give it away, but basically it's about a guy who has nightmares about an unsolved murder/suicide from 1928 who is hypnotized to \\"go back\\" and see if he can solve the mystery.  Very cool.  And the ending of the album is creepy enough to leave you breathless.  This has been lauded as DT's masterpiece, and I can see why.  DT is the rare band, like Rush, that can combine instrumental virtuosity with great songwriting to really shine.  John Petrucci is a guitar wizard, James LaBrie shows off the whole scope of his voice, John Myung is a criminally underrated bass virtuoso, Jordan Rudess is a keyboard god, and Mike Portnoy is Neil Peart to the nth degree...simply jaw-dropping band, and a great, great album!
B000ETQRCM|5.0|Pearl Jam (2006.) Pearl Jam's eighth studio album.<br /><br />After nonstop touring and recording, Grunge juggernauts Pearl Jam unleash their first album in 4 years to the public in 2006, simply titled 'Pearl Jam'. With plenty of hype surrounding it, how does it measure up to the previous albums? YOU find out.<br /><br />Wow... where to begin? They've done it again. Believe the hype, people! At first I didn't care for it AS much as their first 3, or even 'Yield'. But maybe my ears weren't working all that right. While I really liked those albums as well, I truly think this is a lot better than 'No Code', 'Binaural', and 'Riot Act'. Obviously less experimental and more straightforward rawk this time around. This just barely tops 'Vs.' or 'Ten' (hell I might like it better than Ten), and tops 'Vitalogy' and 'Yield' bit by bit. Now, onto the songs. The pumping opener, \\"Life Wasted\\", is a magnificentlely powerful rocker about death. With Vedder's amazing vocal melodies throughout the verses and amazing riffing from Gossard & McCready, plus a very catchy chorus, this is a certified classic from the band. Next up is the first single and big hit from the album (so far), \\"World Wide Suicide\\". Sweet rocker, yet I'm a bit sick of it and one of my least favorites for now. A really good opening that feels like a rollercoaster ride still makes the song worthwile though. It's not bad at all, don't get me wrong, just pales in comparison to other masterpieces on here. \\"Comatose\\", originally a live bootleg song released last year named \\"Crapshoot\\", is a short n sweet kickass punky rocker thatt'll keep your blood pumpin'. It's very reminicent of \\"Spin the Black Circle\\" from 'Vitalogy'. Next up is the nice funk rocker \\"Severed Hand\\". Took me a bit to get into this one, but it is really good. Nice story lyrics. One of my personal favorites is next, \\"Marker in the Sand\\". A very catchy slightly poppy rock song with nice riffs, great lyrics, and excellent trademark Vedder vocals. I could listen to this 10 times on repeat, like most of the songs on here. \\"Parachutes\\" is a beautifully catchy acoustic number that just makes you smile after you get a kick out of it, despite the pretty sad lyrics. Now it's \\"Unemployable\\", the B side of \\"World Wide Suicide\\". I happen to like this irresistable pop rocker tons more than WWS for some reason. Maybe because of it's smooth groove and great riffs. I hope it becomes an A side eventually/ASAP! \\"Big Wave\\" is probably the most rockin' song on the album, as well as being one of the catchiest and most fun. Pearl Jam sure have gone back to the basics quite much! Next is my favorite, the haunting ballad reminicent of \\"Alive\\" or \\"Garden\\", \\"Gone\\"! Almost made me cry, but when I really heard it, I got plenty of chills of course. Most definitely in my top 5 PJ songs ever. \\"Wasted Reprise\\" is a depressing true ending to \\"Life Wasted\\" that also gives me chills. Despite being 50 seconds, this is a beautiful, short n sweet organ ballad that's hard not to feel a little sad to (not quite a bad thing in this case!). \\"Army Reserve\\" is another awesome rocker that reminds me of \\"Red Mosquito\\" on 'No Code', only a bit more uptempo. Yet some more depressing lyrics yet an upbeat tune. Next we have one of the most liked songs by fans on here, another beautiful ballad, \\"Come Back\\". Relaxing, slow, and just gives you more chills and sad thoughts. Great breakup song I would say! Heh, I know that came off silly. I know it's a great show, but the album finally comes to a conclusion with the absolutely EPIC \\"Inside Job\\". This is arguably the overall best thing on here with thought provoking lyrics, acoustic & electric playing, and Vedder singing (or weeping if you call it) his heart out. Another one of my top 5/6 songs by them! Just an amazing ballad that molds into one of the most epic rockers out there this decade. If you skip past this one, you're musically challenged. :P Anyhow, that ends the track reviewing story!<br /><br />Overall: Surely their finest since 'Vitalogy', and barely tops 'Vs.'. Anyone who gave up on them/were disappointed after 'No Code' and on forward should definitely give this a try! This is vintage Pearl Jam right here.<br /><br />HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO FANS OF PEARL JAM, MODERN ROCK, CLASSIC ROCK, GRUNGE, AND ROCK IN GENERAL!

B000069HKH|4.0|I'd like to add to the thoughtful reflections of some of my fellow Bruce fans with some observations on his harmonic progressions. On his first two records, we hear a reckless and youthful creativity, musically and lyrically, which gives way to the more targeted Anthem Rock style of \\"Born to Run.\\" With \\"Nebraska\\", Bruce seemed to put on another hat altogether -- inspired by Woody Guthrie -- that of the folk-troubador. This hat, which he dons again for \\"Ghost of Tom Joad\\" and \\"Devils,\\" is characterized by a simplification of both melody and harmony. While I can see the utility of paring down this way from time to time -- similar to fasting -- to issue it as an end-product can be pretentious. As Woody wrote no songs like \\"Born to Run\\", his three-chord songs were utterly genuine; he didn't know how to do anything else. The \\"Devils\\" CD consists almost entirely of Woody's same I-IV-V chords from someone who knows better. The resulting melodies are frequently as uncrafted as clip art; he might as well be speaking. But perhaps this is the point, and we should hear this as poetry recited over music and let go of our musical expectations. I must confess to being moved by that song on \\"Tom Joad\\", about the Texan who decides in the end not to murder the Vietnamese fisherman. Even though it is an example of the bland musical delivery of which I speak, it may be the lack of harmonic-melodic distraction helps pull us into the story. Then there is the early 90s song, \\"I'll Wait for You\\" which also uses only three chords [though I-IV-vi this time] with admirable Zen-like craft. \\"The Rising\\" reminds us of Bruce's objective musical mastery, while \\"Devils\\" seems principally his subjective musings. The latter still worth getting for the video performance, where his persistent use of falsetto voice contributes to the subjective, dream-state quality.

B000EULJLU|5.0|Tool fans.  Give this album a chance please.  You need to listen to it a few times through before trashing it.  The lyrics are AMAZING as always.  If you don't actually listen or know what this album is all about you are missing the point.  For instance Marie & 10,000 days WHY?        Judith Marie was Maynard James Keenan's mother's name. She was a very religious person. One day she had a stroke that left her in a wheelchair partially paralyzed. This stroke only strengthened her belief in God - something that Maynard found to be pretty ironic. She was paralyzed for 27 years before dying in June 03, which is approximately 10,000 days. She was very religious, (Maynard wrote the APC song \\"Judith\\" at least partially about her - The lyrics in JUDITH reflect how he felt about the whole situation - \\"It's not like you killed someone, It's not like you drove a spiteful spear into his side, You praise the one who left you broken down and paralyzed.\\" He's saying that his mother was a good person who believed in God and yet this is how she was \\"thanked.\\"), 10,000 days is about her finding her savior now that she has passed away.  The song is saying that she should be in heaven, and god should not hold any thing that Maynard did against her. She kept her faith even when Maynard went down a different path. even after spending 27 years paralyzed and basically a miserable life all for her christ and lord. He's saying that she'd better get her wings, she's damn near the posterchild for keeping faith.      If you don't believe me listen to the lyrics.    10000 days in the fire is long enough.   You're going home...     You're the only one who can hold your head up high,   Shake your fist at the gates saying,   \\"I have come home now!\\"     Fetch me the spirit, the son and the father,   Tell them their pillar of faith has ascended.     \\"It's time now!   My time now!   Give me my   Give me my wings!\\"...     Powerful and amazing stuff if you ask me!!!  This is just one example of the manyconcepts within the Album.  I think True Tool fans realize that the lyrics are often just as powerful as the music so when you hear something that some reviews are calling useless filler (which I can't understand because they are great songs) give it a chance and find the true meaning behind it.  It gives it context which helps you realize why the song might not blow your head off like Aenima or The Grudge (which of course we love!!)
0684853523|4.0|I admit the title above is dependent on whether you like Stephen King's work and would like to learn a little about his early life. This book is intended to be part memoir in addition to a writing advice guide, and this is actually a good thing. By learning some of King's childhood and how he began to write, you will discover the foundation to be a competent writer.  <br /> <br />As the book progresses, you gain more tips and less biography, and summaries of King's novels are used to explain writing topics. If you have read many of King's works, the examples will be crystal clear. If you haven't, they are still completlely understandable, but you won't have the entire book experience to draw from, just the summary examples. You may get the feeling that you \\"have to take his word for it\\" instead of having the first hand knowledge of the novel and your own opinion to draw from. <br /> <br />Overall, this is a great book. If you want to be a better writer, this book provides some help in that regard, at least as much as any book I have read. There is no \\"magic bullet\\" that will get you published. In fact your time is usually spent better actually writing that reading about how to write. This book is an enjoyable read and you will learn enough to make your writing and manuscript readable enough to get a fair look by a slush pile reader.
0440241588|2.0|Thoroughly disappointing.  The Grisham novels that I previously read are filled with intrigue and plot twists that keep one turning the pages.  The Broker was completely the opposite.  Very little intrigue, Instead it was mostly a lesson in speaking Italian.  Characters were not developed, and many were left dangling.  400 pages of drivel.  I gave it two stars because 1 star means I hated it.  I paid full price for it and it's just hard for me to admit that I forked over that kind of money for garbage....so I gave it 2 stars to make myself feel better.  I guess I'm too shallow.  But rest assured, Grisham has moved to the bottom of my list and I've got a lot of books to read before I'll pick up another one of his.
B000F48CD8|1.0|Jack White wrote a song for an upcoming Coca-Cola commercial. <br /> <br />Do you want to know why? In the words of Jack White <br /> <br />\\"It was a beautiful commercial & inspired me\\" <br /> <br />Yeah.. Funny how \\"beautiful\\" those Coca-Cola commercials can be when there's a huge check involved. <br /> <br />Jack White sold his soul & has no credibility... I can't believe anything he writes about or says & his music is forever cursed to feel phony because of his greed. He deserves no support.
B00005JMEW|5.0|What a great film, don't know what took so long for me to review it! Tarantino brings everything that Asian cinema has to offer in this film. The classics such as gallons of blood and just flat out martial arts action. You get the best of it all in this film. Nothing like a revenge story to really get the story going. What was so interesting about this film was the many ways the story is told. One minute being live-action and at one point being Anime.<br /><br />The actors and actresses for this film were the perfect choices for who they played. I'm a David Caradine fan from the Kung Fu days and he is still a very impressive actor. To Sonny Chiba in this film was also the right decision to make. In my opinion, probably the best martial-arts movie star besides Bruce Lee, a true legend in my eyes.<br /><br />The storyline is fun, although unrealistic in this day and age. You know she would be in jail for killing all of those people, not to mention she leaves good evidence that she is the one who did all the killings. But who cares? That's what the story is all about, she is wanting everyone to know who is responible. It's her revenge! If you love martial arts movies, especially those classics from the 70's, you have found heaven in this movie!
B000E97Y6K|5.0|As pretentious as it sounds, King Kong is film's answer to \\"the Odyssey\\", in some way.  There is so much going on here, love, action, fantasy, horror, discovery, the things that plumb our depths where things truly matter with absolutely no cheap, shallow \\"social statements\\".  Spiritually faithful to the original, Jackson has done an absolutely amazing job here, contrary to what is said by those who just have to contrary.  I just wish he hadn't somewhat cheapend the effect with typical hollywood pc elements (the black guy is way-cool, guns are evil, capitalists are evil, etc.) only to blow his own politics out of the water moments later (in true B-movie fashion, the black guy bites the big one once again; moments after using a machinegun to save his life, the young crew member throws it away in disgust only to be rescued by the big macho movie star swinging on a vine and blasting everything in sight) although to be fair, that last capitalist bit did lend itself to some good moments.  This aspect of the film will probably give it a rather cheap, dated look someday.  However, they can't detract from the overall experience of the movie.  Though we have become accustomed to CGI SFX, the finale on the empire state building is absolutely incredible, and must be seen to be believed.  2 thumbs up.
B0001XAS2G|5.0|TIME PASSAGES is one of Al Stewart's best albums ever. His music from this period has come under fire from the reviewers at MUSICHOUND, but it's their loss. Stewart had found a sympathetic producer in Alan Parsons, who added much-needed muscle to Stewart's music, and Stewart's folkie leanings also prevented Parsons from overdoing things. The second verse of the title track makes the point that living in the past can make it hard to focus on the present, a theme which I've expressed in putting my dream of looking good for any number of pretty actresses as a higher priority than going to Thanksgiving dinner and Graduation luncheon at my old school. \\"Song On The Radio\\" is also great, and if nothing else quite matches these two peaks, the rest of the album is nevertheless quite consistent. Stewart would put out two more great albums, 24 CARROTS and LIVE- INDIAN SUMMER, and then hit a dry patch musically before coming back in the last eighteen years with a series of excellent releases, including RHYMES IN ROOMS and FAMOUS LAST WORDS. The fact that some of Stewart's work has dated poorly takes nothing away from the lyrical power of this album and its direct predecessor, YEAR OF THE CAT.
B0007XT87G|4.0|So genius composer/guitarist Steve Wilson who just about started Porcupine Tree as a Joke (you must check out the history) takes one big toe into the mainstream.  Yea, it might be a little more radio ready, and who knows who had their hand in making toward that direction (ususally we that love this type of music know that tolls the death bell for our beloved bands and the music).  But !!.... its still really really good stuff and seems like a natural progression for this band.  There are so many sweet passages and nuances in this music that make it special and uncommercial, just as you would expect from Steve Wilson and Porcupine Tree.  Be interesting to see what is next.  I like it.  Hope they stay in there for a long, long time.  Need to here more live (though I have seen them twice, Baltimore in a small club in 2002 (great !) and Amsterdam in a larger venue (OK, a bit dull)).
B000002UJQ|4.0|This album scared the hell outta me! It seems to have some concept to it. Unforgettable classics such as 'Karma Police' and 'No surprises' really make this worth buying. But the real eye opener has to be 'Paranoid Android'! The way the song flows gracefully from start to finish, gives you pure goosebumps! <br /> <br />.Airbag- A cool, crisp opening with some passionate vocals from Thom. It seems to last forever though! 7/10 <br />.Paranoid Android- The best song on the whole album! It explodes into chunky riffs and solos, then slowly fades into dark preacher-like vocals. Then more solos! Johnny's an amazing guitarist! 10/10 <br />.Subterranean Homesick Alien- Lots of cool little sounds going on here! Slightly repetitive, but has a great chorus! 6/10 <br />.Exit music (for a film)- a pure acoustic track with some groaning vocals from Thom, once again! I have to admit, it was atmospheric, but quite tedious. 5/10 <br />.Let down- It seems to have quite an upbeat feel, but not as the lyrics so suggest! Some nice drumming in this one, and some cool synths! 7/10 <br />.Karma Police- One of the best songs on the album! Thom delivers some clever catchy vocals in this! The track seems to burn away at the end! This was impressive. 9/10 <br />.Fitter, Happier- Very creepy computer like vocals. Take note of the lyrics towards the end. This'll have you shivering! 7/10 <br />.Electioneering- A very political rocky track! This is amazing from start to finish! <br /> <br />I can't be bothered to review the other songs, but this is a decent album! Very alternative and electric! A must-have for Radiohead fans! <br /> <br />
B000002542|5.0|If you are looking to step back into a time that you could harmonize with good ole radio friendly, mamby-pamby Journey, forget it.  Go back to the future.  This is real music, before Journey became a mega-commercial hit machine.  I'm not busting the Steve Perry era (well not busting that much, I did kind of like the first two efforts with Perry with 'Infinity' and 'Evolution' to some degree). Anyway, this is the hidden Journey.  The spacey-drifty somewhat psych/prog outfit that nearly everyone has forgotten.  If you are reading this you may have lost your way... turn back now.  Or if you are a fan of inventive, noncommercial, psychedelic stuff - Well then you have found a gem.  Also check out the other 2 albums before Perry came along.  Its not even close to the Journey you remember on the Radio, its better.
0393316041|5.0|Yes, it's true that Feynman was a great scientist. Fortunately, for those not well-versed in physics, it's not necessary to know anything about it to enjoy this book. His escapades are funny, and, if some thought them cruel, I don't think that was his intention. He learned from everything around him, from how people act, to cracking safes (which he did to point out security flaws), to learning about the fascinating world of ants. His sense of humor shines through in all his stories, so that makes this book great fun to read as well as a great resource into the mind of an intelligent and thoughtful man. I cannot recommend this book enough.
B000BNI90O|4.0|I love the music for this film. Of the three soundtracks it seems the most coherent and successful to me even if some of the most striking and memorable themes (such as that for Rohan) come later. In part this is because the first film unfolds along a more unified storyline. The second and third films -- like the books they portray -- tell two inextricably twined stories at once. As a result, the music moves back and forth without the same coherence and, as a result, power of the first soundtrack.<br /><br />The Complete Fellowship contains many gems -- Ian McKellan's hum-singing of the Road Goes Ever On, for example. For the student of soundtrack music and the real fan of the film (as in fanatic -- and I am something of one), it is full of delights. Listening to it is like, well . . . watching the movie without the pictures and dialogue.<br /><br />And that, in a nutshell, is the problem. It isn't a stand-alone composition. The inclusion of every bit of music turns Shore's most coherent soundtrack/composition into a much more episodic entity. It isn't something to put on for a quick (say hour-long) musico-emotional ride through the Middle Earth, the first portion of Tolkien's tale and of Jackson's films. It is a scene-by-scene accompaniment. Which, again, is great if that's what you want.<br /><br />What I'd like to see is the opposite of this project. What I'm hoping for is a complete reworking of the three soundtracks into a single, coherent composition much more along the lines of Wagner's Ring (and Wagner music is already all over Shore's soundtrack). Rather than three boxed sets containing every note of music I'd like a single, integrated composition in which Shore introduces and develops all of his themes MUSICALLY -- as a stand-alone musical composition (however indebted to and evocative of the films) and not as musical accompaniment to the films.<br /><br />That's a tall order. Perhaps beyond the skills of the composer. But it -- and not this more-is-bettersort of archiving -- is the next step.<br /><br />4 stars because I love the music and the inclusion of musical extras. But not 5 because the set is less musically satisfying than the original soundtrack release.
B000FIMG68|5.0|LOST by far is the best action/drama on television, and while the unexpectedness and novelty of the first season has lessened some, the acting, writing, directing, and overall storylines are stellar and there is NO second season slump.  No other show that I can think of has sparked as much interest, debate and excitement, and with the perfect blend of action, mystery, suspense, romance, and yes even comedy at times, LOST has something for everyone. <br />And really, does writing \\"this show sucks\\" qualify as a review?  Ignore stuff like this and once you've seen the first season, definitely check out Season 2, it's WELL worth it!
B000EJ9MTW|5.0|If this is your first time hearing about this band, then you need to go buy this CD right now. I'm a pretty selective music lover, and I can honestly say this band blew my mind. I was amazed to hear a band with a quality reminiscent to Sabbath and Led Zepplin (+ White Stripes), completely solid all the way around. I am so pumped to find there is a band out there that still knows how to rock hard, without any of this pop sytnh 80's, emo BS. Thank God rock still lives on. Amen
B00004RFFI|4.0|A lot of disaster movies tend to be sold around one thing: who's going to bite it and how grisly is it going to be? You don't go see Independence Day or Dante's Peak for compelling storylines and interesting characters, you go for carnage and mayhem and big action pieces. It's rough to say but it's kind of true, so it's odd that Twister doesn't have many onscreen deaths. It does have a lot of destruction and that's probably the main reason to see it. There is a lot of more development than most films but still, it's cool to watch.    Tornado warning systems aren't very effective, especially since tornadoes can hit with little warning time so we have stormchasers who try to take more accurate scientific measurements and hopefully design a more advanced warning system. Only we are dealing with a tornado, an incredibly destructive weather phenomena. And it doesn't help when you have your ex-wife, your soon-to-be wife plus your archrival is around.    It's always funny when you look back on effect shots and notice how much advancements have been made. Yes the effects are most impressive but also at times it looked a bit too CGI-y such as a huge tornado near the end or the debris that they pick up, such as trailers, tractors and barn roofs. But granted this is 10 years ago and it's certainly impressive to watch in action. It's also good that we don't get a whole lot of tornado stuff since it would become very boring and too same-y.    The casting is quite spot-on and I never saw a weak link in the cast, although some people might have a couple. There's a bit of plotholes now and then(or else there's a whole bunch that I never caught since I'm not a science geek). The film does need a bigger special edition than we have since there's so much that documentaries can explain yet we get commentaries and a making-of, nothing too big. It's understandable since Twister is actually the first movie ever released on DVD but it has been 10 years.    It's not dumb fun like Armageddonbut it's at least likable and quite entertaining. Plus it's got flying cows and come on: how can you resist \\"I gotta go, we got cows!\\".
B0000542DJ|1.0|As someone who was born over twenty years after the assassination of John F. Kennedy, my link to this event is more historical than emotional. This is important, for I think it helps me avoid the biases and passionate assumptions that plague so many of my predecessors in the Baby Boomer generation. Everyone alive at that time remembers where they were on the day Kennedy was killed, and since the man represented so many hopes, it is of little wonder that so much emotion and conspiratorial thinking cloud this issue. Some of it is unintended; Oliver Stone's film seems to intentionally mislead.<br /><br />The fact is that everyone from Norman Mailer to Myth Busters has weighed in on the possibility that Oswald did not act alone, or did not shoot the president, or a patsy in the wrong place at the wrong time. Evidence and common sense have forced sources as disparate as these to one conclusion: Oswald had the motive, had the ability, had the opportunity, and was essentially found at the scene of the crime. To test the conspiracy theories, the Discovery Channel recreated the assassination. They gave a rifleman the same gun that Oswald used to shoot a watermelon in a car from the same distance and angle. The rifleman succeeded, and unless you think the CIA 'got' to the Discovery Channel, there is no reason not that Oswald could not have done the same. Oliver Stone should really watch that episode of Myth Busters. It takes apart the popular beliefs that Oswald could not have shot JFK. Mock the source all you want; you cannot mock their findings. Watch for yourself.<br /><br />In my mind, there is a far simpler explanation for all these conspiracy theories that surround JFK and Lee Oswald. People - and leftists like Oliver Stone - simply cannot believe that a man of the left (JFK) was killed by another man of the left (communist-sympathizer Oswald). It is so much prettier to hang the crime on the cliched villains of the liberal drama: the evil right-wing military, 'sell-outs' like LBJ, and 'you-can't-handle-the-truth' g-men. When you also realize that Oliver Stone is an avowed communist and visits Fidel Castro on widely-publicized trips, the situation becomes even clearer. Stone can not afford to believe in the truth of JFK because to do so would besmirch his pet social theory. Then again, that is often the Baby Boomer way. Oliver Stone has really slowed down human progress here by his willful distortions of a complicated subject. Don't reward that.'you-can't-handle-the-truth' g-men.

B0006GVJEE|5.0|Having seen the film at least twelve times, I am looking forward to viewing the film again - still.   Natalie Portman's first film at age twelve, but her emotive range is that of a mature adult.  Jean Reno is simply captivating.  Danny Aiello's role is ambiguous enough to wonder if...

0195067142|5.0|THANK YOU, MR. SLEDGE, FOR WRITING THIS BRILLIANT MEMOIR OF PACIFIC COMBAT IN WW II...I'M A MARINE CORPS INFANTRYMAN MYSELF (IN IRAQ FOR THE THIRD TIME NOW), AND THIS BOOK, ALONG WITH JAMES WEBB'S FIELDS OF FIRE, ARE THE TWO MOST DEAD-ON ACCURATE DEPICTIONS OF THE DAILY LIFE OF THE MARINE CORPS GRUNT IN COMBAT.  MR. SLEDGE DESCRIBES THE HELLISH ENVIRONMENT SO ACCURATELY THAT YOU FEEL LIKE YOU ARE WALKING THE PATROL RIGHT BESIDE HIM.  MORE IMPORTANTLY, HE DESCRIBES HOW THE INFANTRYMAN HOLDS ONTO THE TINIEST, MOST OBSCURE IMAGES OF PEACE AND HUMANITY DURING COMBAT.  I, ALONG WITH THOUSANDS OF OTHER GRUNTS, KNOW WHAT HE MEANS WHEN HE SPEAKS OF THE BEAUTY OF THE LAND AND THE SCENERY DURING THE LULLS IN THE BATTLE.  THAT'S WHAT GETS YOU THROUGH....THAT AND THE UNBELIEVABLE BROTHERHOOD BETWEEN MARINES ON THE GROUND.  MR. SLEDGE'S MEMOIR IS TIMELESS, AND IS THE WORK OF SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN THERE.  IT WAS AN HONOR FOR ME TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO READ HIS WORDS.
B000060P79|3.0|I didn't care for this album because I'm a huge MxPx fan, and If you are like me, then you would know that Simple Plan is trying waaaay to hard to sound like MxPx. I don't like The lead singers voice. I don't reccomend this album, and \\"Still Not Getting Any...\\" is even worse. These guys aren't nothing but a sissy boy band with instuments!
078322687X|4.0|Breakfast Club is one of those films that has worked it's way from 80's teen flick to total cult classic.  While firmly rooted in the 80's it's story is one that that still resonates and remains timeless for people in that age group.  At turns very funny and very sad, it really works to involve its audience and carry them along for the ride as these kids sit through a Saturday detention.  The cast is great, the script has some wicked one-liners and and some great visual gags.  A real 80's classic.
B000669GAI|5.0|WOW! As a somewhat \\"new\\" PJ fan, I have to tell you, this collection is AMAZING! Every single song on it is truly incredible. Give it a listen - it's very, very, worth it!!
B000002HH9|1.0|No matter how often and how many times I've tried to listen to this album I cannot get more than half way without getting so bored with it that I'm compelled to change discs. The Cure has been my all-time favourite band since 1985, and still is to this day (2006), but this album is simply unlistenable drivel. It's not that objectively speaking, the album is the worst thing since Celine Dion, but, standing against the background of such groundbreaking classic Cure favourites as Faith, Pornography and Disintegration; Wild Mood Swings falls right out of the swing and hits itself badly on the head, concussing and haemmorrhaging to death on the hard earth of reality.<br />Some tracks are catchy enough, especially the openers Want, Club America and The 13th, but nonetheless come over as sounding so similar to tracks already done wonderfully before (respectively Open, Harold & Joe and The Lovecats) that they're less like original variations than pale caricatures of them. From there it's all down-swing as the album does a bland, unfocussed and uninspired take on jangly Brit-style pop and ballads. Songs like Mint Car sound so obviously like Smith is trying so incredibly hard to be happy and poppy and fluffy (when he's probably just really drunk) that you can't help cringing when you listen to them. Smith himself has said this is his least liked album The Cure has done of them all.<br />If you're interested in The Cure but new to them - avoid this one, and stick to one of the certified greats, such as the above mentioned titles.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|It unfolds like a great book...song after song like pages in a non-stop thrill ride. What you have just listened to is Stadium Arcadium by the Red Hot Chili Peppers, and what you have just witnessed is music history in the making. True, the Chili Peppers have never been THAT band. They've never been the envy of the music industry. They've never been the band that would set the mark for the pinnacle of musical genius. At the start of their excursion through a world of fusion between rock and funk, so underrated in today's musical culture, they were drowned out by bands starting their own revolution known today as grunge. In a world where Cobain was king, and grunge his kingdom, not many people noticed other bands that were making their own startling contributions to rock music. Bands like the Red Hot Chili Peppers who in 1991 created Blood Sugar Sex Magik, a modern day masterpiece by itself. As BSSM got the Chili Peppers a recognizable voice in the world of rock music, it will be the same with Stadium Arcadium re-establishing that voice as a tour de force in it as well. Instead of going against grunge, today the Chilis are going against something far more overbearing: The Death of Rock and Roll. Things change quickly in today's society. Who would have thought back in the 1970's that thirty years later the biggest act on the map would be a \\"hip hop\\" artist named Kanye West. Who would have thought that bands who were powerhouses: ACDC, Pink Floyd, The Rolling Stones, would be virtually non-existant today. It may be karma, but it seems as if the Chilis have put their foot down. Like the Beatles and Nirvana before them, they are saying \\"F*ck this, lets make some music!\\"  <br /> <br />And they DID make music. Music that will bring to life the spirits of acts that have long since passed. Music that may harness a little bit of Floydian psychedelia and ACDC attitude. The opening beats of Dani California suggest just that. From song to song the Chilis seem to be taking theirsweet-ass time telling the world that rock still lives. And they do a pretty damn good job. Gone are the days of Chili Pepper, tube socked, rave party, drug enhanced stupor that made them such an \\"entertaining\\" act back in the 80s and 90s. In their place? Do words describe what is in their place? Simply listen to the opening guitar of Snow (Hey Oh) and you tell me whats in their place now. Mature, grown up, music artists fill the speakers with a tasteful rock that even the stingiest of rock collectors will take as a promising step forward. Did you ever think that people would be calling Flea a mature, grown up, musical artist?! That day has come and it is all the more deserving. Flea shines bright on this two disc plethora, as does his bandmates. John Frusciante, who digs into his guitar and pours out his soul deeper on this record than ever has in the Chili's previous endeavors. Chad Smith, whos quick, up-tempo, ringing drumming provides the backbone for the entire album. And of course there's Anthony Kiedis who proves himself as one of the most versatile, and lyrical frontmen and songwriters in the history of rock n' roll. You dont need to take my word on this one to realize how, not only incredible this album is, but also how important it is for rock music. Listen to just one song. You tell me if its not better than anything out there today. People dont realize how big the Chili Peppers have struck on this one. Perhaps the band itself doesnt even know. The bottom line is that the world is a big place and very difficult to conquer. The Red Hot Chili Peppers are taking it one monstrous album at a time.
0812550706|3.0|The effect this book had on me, would have been much greater if I had read it during childhood.  In this book, Orson Scott Card succeeds in two very difficult tasks: writing from the perspective of pre-pubescent children; and bringing new life to the Super-Man sci fi genre. <br /> <br />Ender is a character that many intelligent and mature children will emphasize with.  His talent ensures that he is always working and competing with older children.  He's by himself, resented by the older children because of his superior ability, resented by his older brother Peter who thinks he should be the prodigy, resented by schoolmates because he's a third child (there's a stigma attached to this in the future), and resented by his parents for the same reason. <br /> <br />How does Ender respond to these pressures?  In the only way that he can.  When Stilson mocks him and threatens him with violence, Ender lashes out viciously.  When his opponent is already helpless, Ender kicks him again and again to ensure that no witness will ever bully him again.  Stilson dies as a result of the fight, and Ender's correct choice of action wins him a ticket to the Battle School.   <br /> <br />Upon reaching the school, Ender is forced to overcome fatigue, hostility, severe numerical and informational disadvantages, and inexperience.  Ender eventually wins the respect of his teammates in the only way he can....through sheer preeminence. <br /> <br />One reason I give only 3 stars is that too many plot elements failed the straight face test.  Ender's siblings Valentine and Peter take over political control of earth through manipulative E-mails......the various Field commanders of the International Fleet (through the medium of computer simulators) are all children.......and I could go on.  Some reviewers are unhappy with Card's pedestrian prose (and hilariously bad impression of latin machismo), but I wont fault him for this because the book is geared toward precocious children and complementstheir reading level admirably.   <br /> <br />The dispositive reason for 3 stars as opposed to 4, is that the biggest draw of this book (Ender's baptism by fire) has concluded, and there's nothing left to interest me in continuing with the other 7 books in the series.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|This film never ceases to take my breath away every time I watch it; it's witty, action-packed, and you get to hear our favourite characters speak for the first time! And as promised, the animation is always beautiful and completely flawless. <br /> <br />Yes, it would be extremely hard to appreciate this film if you hadn't played the game beforehand. By playing the game you got to know and love all the characters, and when I saw all the characters together and helping each other out in the film, it was actually quite touching. This would go right over the heads of the people who had never played the game (who are missing out on TONNES of fun by the way :] ) <br />However, even without playing the game, it is fast and fun. My little brother sat and watched it in amazement the whole way through without saying a word (as you can see that's very uncommon with him). <br /> <br />All the characters are just as they were in the game, just as they should be. Reno and Rude are absolutely HILARIOUS. No joke, they make me laugh so much, they're probably some of my favourite characters in the film even though they weren't my favourite in the game. Yuffie is the cute and mischievous girl she was in the prequel. Barrett, loud mouthed and cheeky. <br /> <br />I must say, this film is probably one of my favourite films EVER, and that's saying something (I have A LOT of favourite films). Square Enix, you have done a fantastic job. Bravo for another terrific acheivement!
B000EMGAOY|1.0|This album was a huge disappointment.  The Chili Peppers had become more pop a little less funk in Californication and then when by the way came out it was very popish but this cd, Stadium Arcadium is like they were trying to do some good pop and trying to do some good funk to be a mixture of One Hot Minute and By the Way and what came out was bad lyrics, horrible (if any) rhythm and just an album I only bought because I am a fan and I THOUGHT it would be worth it.  It isnt.  Save your money.  This is the only RHCP album I have ever disliked and it is a pity.  You will gain nothing by listening to this album and it was supposed to \\"knock my socks off.\\"  As anticipated as this album was, the Chili Peppers certaintly messed up.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|The film had a profound effect on me personally as it did many other people, straight and gay alike. This film wonderfully combines score, cinematography, script and acting while being expertly directed by a master, Ang Lee. Ang Lee was awarded the Oscar , Golden Globe and the Director's Guild award for his direction of Brokeback Mountain. The story is one of a never fully realized love that suffers from what society deems love \\"should\\" be. The acting by the entire cast is first rate. Never over the top but, showing just the right amount of restraint to make the characters seem as if they are real people. Brokeback Mountain is a ground breaking film that i will still consider years from now as one of my all time favorites!
0920668372|5.0|This is a lovely book and one that I read to my kids over and over. I think some readers are missing the point here, which is that this book is a parable of how a mother's love is given to her children all of their lives, even into adulthood and in doing so, this love is not only returned to her, but passed on to future generations.  If a child is frightened by the mother reaching the end of her life in the book perhaps he's not well enough prepared for this reality.
B000BJS4SU|4.0|I really enjoy this CD.  The musicianship is top notch and the songs have a bluesy, rock sound.  One thing that could have been improved is the quality of the recording (although this gives it an attractive grittiness).  Favorite tracks include \\"Another Kind of Green\\"  and \\"Good Love is On the Way\\".   <br /> <br />Mayer proves he is not just another pretty boy by proving he can keep up with both Steve Jordan on drums and Pino Palladino on bass.  He is a very good guitar player who can sing as well. <br /> <br />If I had to again, I would buy this CD.
B000046PVN|4.0|I have lusted after this edition of the Superman: The Movie soundtrack ever since it originally came out back in 2000. I was heartbroken when I found that it very quickly went out of print and became a rather hard-to-find item in the market, commanding $75-$100 price tags from third-party sellers. <br /> <br />I was ecstatic when it just very recently became available again (no doubt to take advantage of the new Superman Returns movie coming out next month) and just got my hands on it today. I'm listening to it right now as I write this and it is an absolute joy to experience. You'd certainly be hard-pressed to find a grander, more memorable set of music for a comic-book character (or any character, really!) Just aces. <br /> <br />However, I'm more than a little disappointed at how this recent pressing seems to lack the rather extensive liner notes that originally came with this edition in 2000(all it has is a single paper slip with the cover on the front and a B&W photo of Jor-El and Lara on the reverse). I'm a little baffled by this and would like to know if anyone has any info regarding this situation. Are all copies lacking the notes, or is it just that I had the bad luck of getting an incomplete copy and should return it for a replacement? Any help would be appreciated... <br /> <br />Liner notes (or lack thereof) notwithstanding, the music on this CD is quite simply brilliant, both technically and creatively. Plus the chronological listing of tracks and bonus material are an added treat for completists. So, the music gets 5+ stars, but the packaging (with the missing booklet) brings it down a notch. Still, a great buy, especially if you have a soft spot for the Big Guy, like me.
B0000029GA|5.0|Just adding another five star tally to the Bible of Rap: Illmatic. I find it impossible to give it less. <br /> <br />This is Nas' best effort and the album that made him famous. While most people slept on It Was Written nobody slept on Illmatic. It was, and still is to this day, my favorite album out there (even against classics like Tupacs' Me Against The World and Snoop Dogg's Doggystyle) because of the lyrical genius and raw underground beats. Nas' flow and ability to delivery quality lyrics is pretty much unmatched (Tupac withstanding) on this album compare to what was out there even in the glorious years of rap, and it boggles my mind why rappers today haven't figured out that fewer tracks and higher quality is much more important then dishing out multiple tracks (however even Nas fell victum to this unfortunate event a few years ago). <br /> <br />Enough about what happended after Illmatic. Illmatic by itself is truly the \\"Bible of Rap\\". Let's face it, this album is a work of art. From the introduction, to the end, this album doesn't fail to deliver classics. If you don't own Illmatic do yourself a favor and pick it up and hear the experiece of a lifetime.
076792603X|4.0|A great read that keeps your attention but this version is very heavy and hard to get comfortable with when reading it.
B0001I55OC|5.0|When I first saw the preview for this film, I thought that it looked like a really exciting story.  I had no idea that it was based off a book and now that I have seen the movie, I am interested in reading the book as comparison.<br /><br />Basically, to give a general view of the plot outline, is that a group of archaeologists which include Gerard Butler, Paul Walker, and Frances O' Connor, have to go back in time to save Walker's father who, having gotten suspicious of a technology institute, got transported back to 1357, Castlegard, France, right smack in the middle of the 100 Years War.<br /><br />Once back there, the heroes learn the secrets of the markers that they wear around their necks.  The biggest thing to remember is that they only have six hours within which they have to get the professor back to the current millenia.  The stars have exciting run-ins with the English and the French.  Also, there are two love stories weaved into the film including Walker's and O' Connor's, as well as Butler's with a French woman, (Anna Friel).  There are a few very cute scenes between these two which I absolutely loved.<br /><br />This film ultimately ends in a very exciting way with realistic battle and a surprising, but happy conclusion.<br /><br />To sum it all up, this movie has everything to offer- action, adventure, romance, and that basically keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this film to anyone interested in a good film to watch.<br /><br />I loved Timeline.

B0007P3582|1.0|Just read the title. Ok when he first came out with \\"Get Rich or Die Trying\\" I admit I kinda liked a few of the songs. Not that they had any real meaning. The lyrics weren't anything we haven't heard before, but it was catchy. You know kinda like a jingle from a commercial. Now it's going way too far! Every freakin song I hear on the radio is 50 cent. All the beats sound the same with all the same lame hooks. Normally I will forgive a song poor beats as long as it has good lyrical content, but there is absolutely NOTHING salvageable about this album or his cookie cutter G~Unot lackys. Sorry to say but 50 and guys like him are what is wrong with rap today.
B000ASATWQ|5.0|NOW EVERY SINGLE TRACK ISN'T GOING TO BE A HIT, AS THAT GOES WITH EVERY ALBUM, EVEN BOB MARLEY HAD ALBUMS WITH OK SONGS, BUT THATS REALLY NOT THE POINT.

B00004T9UF|5.0|I bought this album way back in the day. I think when I was 16 or 17. All I really remember is that when I heard it I LOST MY FREKIN MIND!!!! It was like nothing I had ever heard. Eminem is a wordsmith . Through every song you can live out his point of view clearly, regardless if you agree with it or not.This was always in the car and always in the stereo at home. I could still listen to the whole thing straight through. His best work to date
2266144340|4.0|As a murder mystery with a complex plot, I read the book from cover to cover between shifts and even on shift at work. I always wanted to know what happened next.<br /><br />The various clues given to Sophie and Langdon were only an iota more complex than a Hardy Boys mystery. I found myself shouting at the book for at least two of the clues (even without having to visit Westminster Abbey and see Newton's tomb). After having figured out the ancient word for wisdom and using Atbash with the Hebrew language, how can anyone miss the Newton clue?<br /><br />The interesting takes on the Last Supper are not news to me, altough I had forgotten about the hand with the knife. Having never connected the legendary chalice with the painting, that was no surprise, either. LDV wasn't around when the supper happened, and it is his rendition of the scene. The theory of Mary M. being the wife of Jesus is hardly the Holy Grail. At least one very large group of people on earth already have the belief that Jesus married and had children. I am one of those. So when the Grail was revealed, it was a ho-hum revelation to me.<br /><br />I have only read the book once, and I have to go back to read it again (or the parts that I must have overlooked). I think there is at least one very loose end. At one point Fache was ready to wax Langdon as the killer and relentlessly tracks the fugitives. He has a connection with the Opus Dei, and we start to suspect he has alterior motives. When he finally comes face to face with the fugitives, he is overly nice to them and all is forgiven.<br /><br />It's a good light read, and I had put off reading it because I heard it made the catholic church upset. I am not catholic, but I don't agree with sect bashing. In the end, the book is entirely fiction and any offense taken by any sect is unfounded. The theories of the \\"cover up\\" were laughable in my mind and added no great suspense or value to the murder mystery.<br /><br />Yes, read it, just because of the interesting historical facts laced with theories.se of the interesting historical facts laced with theories.
B000F48CD8|4.0|The Raconteurs' sound is a sort of blues-psychedelia that's too fully inhabited to feel affected - about 97% of the time, anyway.  There's an occasional chord change that's a little too studied, but it's fine. <br /> <br />There are ten songs on this very short album (it clocks in at just under thirty-five minutes), and while that means every song needs to count, it also means that even the most tossed-off sounding tune is over with before it can really drag the proceedings down.   <br /> <br />\\"Steady As She Goes\\" is the lead song and single, and it's infectiously hooky.  A great summer single, and one of the better tracks on the disc.  The real standout is \\"Broken Boy Soldier,\\" a Zep-alike that sounds like a galloping herd of young adult angst - a fitting sound for a song that addresses aging from boy to man.  (In that sense, it's a sort of companion piece to \\"Steady,\\" which seems ambivalent about the step of marriage: is it maturity and adventure or compromise and surrender?) <br /> <br />There are a handful of other particularly good songs - \\"Intimate Secretary,\\" \\"Level,\\" \\"Store Bought Bones,\\" \\"Call It a Day,\\" and \\"Blue Veins.\\"  Fine stuff. <br /> <br />This is a good, solid album that, like the Traveling Wilbury's first outing, suffers or excels precisely because it's kind of inconsequential.  There's not a lot of pretension; just musicians with a certain amount of luxury, trying things out.  By and large, it works, but if the listener is burdened too much with expectations (it's not a groundbreaking masterpiece) or complaints (yeah, they do sound like Led Zeppelin on a couple of tunes [and that's bad?]), a little generosity of spirit might need to be summoned so one can enjoy what's really a nice little gem.  The gem just happens to be, say, sapphire rather than diamond.
B000EMGAOY|4.0|Well it seems that the Peppers have disappointed and enlightened with this currest release (Stadium Arcadium). This release seems to pick up possibly where \\"Blood, Sugar Magic\\" leaves off. But then again, this album does sound like a mixture of \\"Californication,\\" and \\"B,S M.\\" I am not one bit disappointed and believe the band has taken another step to becoming the best funkin'punk-rock band of my time with quality and melodic, stylic music.  <br /> <br />With that in mind, John seems to be really regaining back his talent (as I knew he would) and is making an obvious come-back. On Californication, he did show how he can play a mean riff but seemed a tad tainted. With the release of Stadium Arcadium, he seemed to step up to the plate and hit a home run. He really seems to have been the missing piece the Peppers lost in the late 90's and he has found his way back to completion with this latest release.  <br /> <br />All and all, this is a compilation I recommend. The music does tell a story and keeps you interested through the last song.  <br /> <br />The telling of the story is there if you look past your judgements... <br /> <br />G-man <br /> <br />
0307277674|3.0|This was very predictable. Over hyped. It was a good quick read.  Nothing to get excited about.  Might make a better movie. Written like it was meant to be one.  Not great not bad. enjoy.

B000EMGJM2|5.0|Reviewers have cited some of popular music's most esteemed innovators when pressed to describe Van Hunt's sound. Of course, it could mean that the music (or the man) is unoriginal or derivative.  Thankfully for Mr. Hunt the comparisons are apt and the accolades deserved. VH is original and undeniably talented; a skilled musician and songwriter and a charismatic live performer. VH's sophomore effort is a bold step forward that makes good use of the groundwork laid by his excellent self-titled 2004 debut. At the same time it is a largely successful attempt to make his music more accessible.   <br /> <br />\\"On The Jungle Floor\\" is an homage to some pioneering funkateers by a fully-formed artist who is much more than the sum of his influences. On HOT STAGE LIGHTS, a punk-funk explosion, Hunt fends off one of those femme fatales that Rick James knew so well. Several tracks have a distinctly purple glow; IF I TAKE YOU HOME would fit comfortably on \\"1999\\" while THRILL OF THIS LOVE harkens way back to the \\"Dirty Mind\\" era. AT THE END OF A SLOW DANCE is primo 80's synth-rock reminiscent of the Psychedelic Furs. The \\"retro\\" vibe of OTJF is completely welcome, like a visit from an old friend with a brand new hat. Other standouts are SUSPICION, BEING A GIRL, NIGHT IS YOUNG and CHARACTER.  Despite the varied musical references, OTJF is cohesive and consistently great; held together by inspiration, solid musicianship, clever songs and VH's roguish charm.  <br /> <br />OTJF is a musically adventurous set that should help Van Hunt shed the unwarranted \\"neo-soul\\" tag; his sound, a compelling fusion of rock, funk, modern-pop and soul, is too robust to be categorized alongside the treacly whine of the latest \\"neo-soul\\" lothario. In a perfect world, VH would be all over radio in almost every format. Unfortunately, corporate radio recoils from anyone who doesn't fit neatly into some marketing guy's idea of a music genre, particularly urban radio. On the upside, just like Prince, Me'shell and Ben Harper, VH has the goods to blaze his own trail.  <br />
B00004W50T|3.0|I know there are a lot of fans of The Band that disagree with me on this one.  But, I really think the hype for this record has far exceeded the quality. I am a fan, but I really don't believe this release comes close to the quality of their follow-up self-titled release.  There is no doubt that a number of the songs on this CD are outstanding and the playing overall is excellent. My major problem with it is the performances never seem to catch fire.  It's almost too relaxed sounding.  In other words, it gives new meaning to the term laid back. This is surprising when considering their history as a touring band. <br /> <br />I think most of the well known songs on the CD have been recorded more effectively either by other artists or The Band itself in live settings. This would be especially true of \\"This Wheels on Fire\\" and \\"I Shall Be Released\\". For example, both the Byrds and the Hollies released much better versions of \\"This Wheels on Fire\\" around the same time. A positive for this new remastered version of this CD is the overall excellent sound quality and bonus tracks. I'm sure Band fanatics will want to have this, but what about the casual fan or the newly initiated?  <br /> <br />For new fans that want to economically experience The Band, I have 2 suggestions. One would be to purchase the remastered, extended release of their 2nd release simply called \\"The Band\\". It would be going too far to say this is all The Band you really need. But rather than picking up some of their other releases which have great moments mixed in with mediocrity, I would suggest the excellent 2 CD compilation, \\"To Kingdom Come\\" from about 15 years ago. It is a tremendous collection that truly negates the need to buy any other releases. Here you will get great songs such as \\"Life Is a Carnival\\" without having to listen to the filler surrounding it on the Cahoots CD. You will also get the best stuff from \\"Big Pink\\" such as \\"Chest Fever\\" and \\"The Weight\\", too! That's my honest take on this. I certainly don't dislike \\"Big Pink\\", but I do tend to view it as a warm-up for what was yet to come. <br />

0099267195|5.0|A friend picked this up for me because the song of the same name has been my favourite for many years.  The song, Charlotte Sometimes, by The Cure was written based on the book. <br /> <br />This sweet story was so well written and an enjoyable read.  Its YA fiction, so its short (only about 150 pp) and easy to read, but very hard to put down. <br /> <br />It very much reminded me of Coraline, by Neil Gaiman.
B000BBOUCW|5.0|Okay, I do not have a PSP but whnever I try to review the same thing it won't let me. I had reviewed AC on DVD so here I am to rate the english version. I had seen the Japanese version.<br /><br />STEVE BURTON AS CLOUD: Good choice for him. Although he kinda sounded like a valley-girl, he still fit Cloud.<br /><br />QUINTON FLYNN AS RENO: Not bad either. He had some of the worst quotes, though. (Mother schmother it's jenova's friggin head)<br /><br />RACHEL LEIGH COOK AS TIFA: Terrible! I mean \\"dilly dally shilly shally!\\"? Plus she kinda sounded \\"waspy\\".<br /><br />MENA SUVARI AS AERITH: WAY BETTER than her craptastic job at Aerith in Kingdom Hearts 2.<br /><br />BENJAMIN BRYAN AS DENZEL: Pretty good except when he yelled Son of a b**ch at Bahamut.<br /><br />DAVID WITTENBERG AS KADAJ: Hilarious!<br /><br />STEPHEN BLUM AS VINCENT: sweet. cool voice! I wish my voice was as low as his... well mines kind of.<br /><br />SO not bad english dub. Still prefer the Japanese version.
0307277674|1.0|Poorly written with preposterous allegations and trails.  Dan Brown is not a great story teller. Only for new and unsophisticated readers. Did not finish book but will probably see movie as two hours and a few dollars may be worth the entertainment as oppossed to a 12 hour read!
B000F48CD8|5.0|**WARNING: This review engages in shameless Jack White lovefest, as this reviewer is a shaleless Jack White fanatic. Those of you who aren't fans of the man or his band(s), or those of you tools who call him a sellout, turn around now, because this review is just going to tick you off.**  <br /> <br />The title says it all...John Anthony Gillis, better known as Jack White, is not only the president, CEO, AND vice president of the new movement of rock and roll that, while remaining a relatively underground movement to the left of that Atlantic, has swept our brethren over in the great country of England; he is the greatest musician of our generation. I'd even venture to say he's the most genius musician since Frank Black Francis Charcoal Franky Dark Franklin, or whatever moniker combining variations of the name Frank and the color black the former Pixies frontman is going by these days. Ever since this man exploded onto the scene as the frontman/guitarist of the White Stripes, he has been lauded by many as a prodigy, something of a savior of rock and roll (unfortunately, looking back, that hasn't been the case, at least in the American mainstream). Along with his simplistic drummer sister/wife Meg White, he created three very, very good albums (self-titled, \\"Elephant\\", \\"Get Behind Me Satan\\"), and two downright flawless albums (\\"De Stijl\\", \\"White Blood Cells\\"). This legend-in-the-making, apparently getting bored with shouldering the load of the biggest, best rock band in the world, has ventured from the White Stripes, produced an acclaimed comeback album for country legend Loretta Lynn, and now teamed with a fellow Detroiter, acclaimed singer-songwriter Brendan Benson and the rhythym section from relatively unknown Cincinatti band The Greenhornes to form a new band with a completely new sound. And this man can just not fail with any music he contributes to. Here, on his new band The Raconteurs' debut album, he decides to work with Benson and recalling 60's pop (the good kind), and succeeds at nearly every turn. One wouldn't be too far off to think this was an old Kinks record. The infectious leadoff single, \\"Steady As She Goes\\" is merely an appetizer to a hard-hitting, well-written, quick, and remarkable power-pop album. The band approaches the pop song from a new angle on nearly every song on here, and even go prog-rock for \\"Store Bought Bones\\", but it is clear throughout that they are trying to recreate 60's and early 70's pop, when pop was still good and not Top 40 bubblegum muck, and succeed masterfully. \\"Hands\\" will be stuck in your head for days. \\"Broken Boy Soldier\\" and \\"Intimate Secretary\\" showcases how full Jack White's vocal/guitar attack can be when backed by a bassist and \\"real\\" drummer (don't get me wrong, I *do* like Meg White and what she brings to the Stripes, but her rhythyms *are* very simple), with Jack White summoning a Robert Plant howl on the latter. Together is clearly a Benson-driven track, but is catchy throughout nonetheless. \\"Level\\" is the closest Jack comes on the record to wailing away on his guitar and flat-out rocking. \\"Store Bought Bones\\", \\"Yellow Sun\\", and \\"Call It A Day\\" are all solid, but forgettable tracks, but then the album closes brilliantly with possibly the best track on the album, the pseudo-masterpiece \\"Blue Veins\\". All in all, I have my money on this album being the best of the summer, and possibly the year (it's between The Strokes' \\"First Impressions of Earth\\", Arctic Monkeys' \\"Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not, and likely the Kings of Leon's \\"Because Of The Times\\", due out fall of this year). And, I have my money on Jack White being viewed as a musical genius, and a legend years from now, a true revolutionary, the face of Generation X rock and roll.
B000EULJLU|5.0|The previous poster made a comment stating that the song '10,000 days' was possibly a filler track.   <br /> <br />The title track of the album, part 2 of a two-part song, is a tribute (you could say) to his mother.  His mother's name was Judith Marie Garrison (made note of during the climax of the song where he sings her name). <br /> <br />Many years ago his mother suffered a stroke, and the period of time between her stroke and when she passed was 10,000 days.  Listen to the song again and read the lyrics, and think about it in terms of a loved one passing, and ascending.  He talks about 'no one could hold a candle to you', and 'give me my wings'. <br /> <br />I view it as a very personal song, and considering that last song considered personal was \\"Jimmy\\", which contained incredibly guarded lyrics, it's quite a change for his writing style.
B000EMGAOY|3.0|Stadium Arcadium is a solid cd,with a good blend of old school Peppers and new school Peppers.The biggest problem with it is the same problem that occurs on most 2cd sets and that is there are too many songs that just arent that good.If the Peppers had made this a single disc,it very well could have been their best since Blood Sugar.There are enough solid songs to make one pretty good disc.I love the fact that they brought back some of their old style to go along with their current sound.It makes for a all around listen which is nice.Highlights include \\"Dani California\\",\\"Charlie\\",\\"Shes Only 18\\",\\"Hard To Concentrate\\",and \\"If\\".Songs such as \\"We Believe\\" and \\"Especially In Michigan\\" I could live without.All together though I put together an 18 track disc that is pretty solid,so that leaves about ten tracks on here that really dont need to be here.That is unless of course for some silly reason the artist feels the need to release a double disc.
0440237688|5.0|The novel shows the dramatic events that take place when a young boy is forced to accept what he does not beleive in. The boy then with the help of his mentor escapes the world in which he had lived for all his life to a life he has never experienced before. The novel grasps the imagination of the reader through the detailed imagery of the \\"ideal\\" society portrayed in the novel. The relationship between the characters especially the boy, Jonas and the Giver also make the story captivating and interesting. <br /> <br />The author Lowry does an amazing job in describing the community in which Jonas lives. It is important for the reader to Understand the type of society in which Jonas lives because it is completely different from the normal society of today. The description of the society helps to explain Jonas' disagreement with the society and hence his decision to escape. <br /> <br />The author does a good job in showing the relationships between the characters. The author shows a weaker relationship between Jonas and his family members because of the way the society is maintained while there is a strong bond between Jonas and his mentor. The relationships between the characters help the reader to understand how the society works even better. The relationship between the characters thickens the plot of the story especially when the giver reveals the secrets of the society to Jonas and the way Jonas reacts towards the new found truth.
0312330537|5.0|This book took me down the streets of Bombay, where I was born. Even though I spent twenty two plus years in Bombay, the book, took me places where I could never have gone myself. <br /> <br />This book is a piece of literature that makes the world a smaller place urging any one who reads it to take a trip to Bombay and see it as it is. <br /> <br />Don't let the size of the book put you off, it is an absolute page turner. Fantastic! A must own book.
B00000I8UF|5.0|Moanin' and Miles Davis' \\"Kind of Blue\\" are my two favorite jazz albums. When people ask me for an introduction to jazz I recommend those two, cuz if they don't like 'em they just ain't ever gonna like jazz! <br /> <br />Lee Morgan blows me away on this album. His sassy solo on the title track and his light touch on \\"Betty\\" are to die for. Bobby Timmons is the epitome of soul and style on every track and his compositions are always first rate. <br /> <br />BUY THIS CD!!!!!!!
B000002AGE|5.0|This album was very recently my first full exposure to Jazz/Rock fusion.  It's very different from some of the prog rock I have been listening to, but it's pretty dang good stuff.  I can recommend BirdLand, Teen Town, Remark You Made, and Havona as the highlights of this disc.  Furthermore, this disc and the band Weather Report has introduced me to the bass master Jaco...not too many cd's can offer as much in one compilation as this.
B000FL7CAK|5.0|I couldn't be more excited about the Veronica Mars Season 2 DVDs, especially now that the third season on The CW is officially a go.<br /><br />After solving the murder of her best friend last year, all Veronica (the divine Kristen Bell) wants is a fresh start. \\"Normal,\\" she says. \\"That's the watchword.\\"<br /><br />But things will never be normal for Veronica Mars, as she discovers before the end of the first episode of the season. The world she inhabits is a dark one -- it may be set in Southern California, but the reality doesn't match the sunny setting.  There are secrets. Secrets to be kept and protected at all costs. Secrets that could cost someone their life.<br /><br />And Veronica will find them out.<br /><br />As an assistant to her private investigator father (Enrico Colantoni), Veronica has methods of obtaining information that the average high school senior couldn't even imagine. Combined with a keen intellect and razor-sharp wit, Veronica could give Jack Bauer or Dr. House a run for their money.<br /><br />The entire cast is stellar, from Percy Daggs III as Veronica's best friend Wallace, to Francis Capra as motorcycle gang leader Weevil, to Tina Majorino (Napoleon Dynamite) as computer whiz Mac, to Jason Dohring as the sinister, sexy, snarky bad boy (and former flame of Veronica) Logan Echolls.<br /><br />Season 2 also features Charisma Carpenter and Steve Guttenberg, with notable guest appearances by Alyson Hannigan, Harry Hamlin, Kevin Smith, Joss Whedon, and Michael Cera and Alia Skawkat of 'Arrested Development' fame.<br /><br />I'd imagine that there have been other TV shows as good as Veronica Mars, but I've never found them. Don't miss out on the best show you probably aren't watching!
B00004UEDQ|5.0|28 Days starring Sandra Bullock, she was courageous to take such a challenging role like this. She plays an alcoholic who is placed in a rehab center for, well you guessed it 28 days. I think Bullock is at her best when she does drama, I love her comdies as well but she expands her talent and growth as an actress in dramatic roles. This film does have funny moments from time to time but it is mainly a hard-hitting drama. The scene where Bullock is in the withdrawal period of her addiction is real and heartbreaking. She is and probably will never be recognized as a gifted performer, she should have been nominated for an award, like the golden globes or something. 28 Days is quirky, spunky, and cute just like Sandy!
068817776X|4.0|This book is a completely different look at how a woman survived the Holocaust. It is about a woman who survived not even knowing what was actually happening to her fellow Jews. It was interesting to read about how she went on day to day through this terrible time, and even how Arians lived during this period also.
0060930187|5.0|The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath is an American literary masterpeice. I read this book last fall and I could not wait to read a chapter every night before I went to sleep. Plath was a genius, first I read all her poems and then immediatley purchased The Bell Jar and I was fascinated with the story of Esther. This book is semi-autobiographical. Esther's world is turned upside down when her depression sinks deeper into thoughts of suicide. She resents her mother, wishes her father was still alive, and is rejected for her writings. The passage that frightened me the most is when Esther loses her virginity to a much older man, the way Plath describes this scene gave me chills and even the chapter where she tries to kill herself by slicing open her wrists made me a bit nauseous. But The Bell Jar is a quick, eloquent read, a must have for Plath fans everywhere!
0743454529|5.0|This was the first book I have ever read by Jodi Picoult and because of it I have continued to read more and more of her wonderful work. This story truely touched my heart and I begged my younger sister to read it as when I was done and it really gave us more of a appreciation for one another. I finished this book in about 3 days...I just couldn't put it down. Anyone with a sibling will love it.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|Britney Spears, In the Zone is probably her best and most interesting album to date. Well I don't love all the tracks, I like seven out of twelve and those songs include: Me against the music (with Madonna), Everytime, Brave New Girl, Shadow, Toxic, Touch of my Hand, and Breathe on Me. unfortanely, her voice has not improved, it's still thin, flat, and monotone but that's not why I somewhat like her, she has this great and natural ability to make crummy songs into catchy and fun songs. The rest of the tracks are so dumb and senseless. Spears is obviously obsessed with singing songs that talk frankly about sex. We get the idea, you like to get down and dirty, now move on! But still she shows growth and promise with In the Zone, maybe one day she will make a record with depth. Good luck with that Mrs. Federline.
B0006L16N8|2.0|\\"Speed of Sound\\" is a very good song, and \\"Fix You\\" is sublime.  Other than that, this album doesn't have much going for it.  (Get \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\" instead---that was a great album.)
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Have you seen the part in finding nemo where the seagulls are saying \\"MINE! MINE! MINE!\\" I did this when a friend let me borrow his series. I'm a HUGE Star Trek fan and believe me when I say, this series tears the off the head, reaches down and rips out the soul of DS9, Voyager, Enterprise, and last 2 Trek movies. This series is like a great song that is timeless as I can never get sick of it. I love the peppered humor, great acting from the entire cast, writing, and the freshness that TV once had. People are real, there is no Techno-babble, and the troubles are the same as they are today. if you are looking for something fresh, different, and want to laugh & cry, immerse yourself in these characters. This show will make you feel great! Hope this review helps you! <br />\\"Mercy is the mark of a great man, *stick* -guess I'm just a good man, *stick* -well I'm alright.\\"
B000069CWE|4.0|i rarely review albums unless i read something so stupid it bears responding to. this MPD 360 cat or whatever the hell his/her/its name is is a flaming retard. why? let me break it down really quick: <br /> <br />a.) he cites Linkin Parks' monotony...and then suggests Underoath as an alternative...Underoath is one of the most monotonous emo-rock bands ever...and every single member of the band looks like a clone of one guy who cuts himself, wears sweaters and doesn't like to be able to see through his dirty blonde hair. <br /> <br />b.) he complains that the songs don't sound like the originals...what retard buys a remix album to hear the original versions? <br /> <br />c.) he somehow manages to miss the fact that Linkin Park is heavily influenced by hip hop...and complains about there being MCs on this project...maybe he never heard the rapping on the original version, noticed the band has a DJ, or heard of them doing collaborations with Jay-Z on the Collision Course EP, and Dan The Automator on the Handsome Boy Modeling School albums...maybe he just doesn't know. SOMEBODY ought to tell him, then. <br /> <br />d.)he says Linkin Park uses simplistic chord structures and melodies and layers...whether they're top 40 or not, Linkin Park has one of the most multilayered and densely mixed sounds I've ever heard in my life...and I get paid to review albums. <br /> <br />The verdict? this guy is a retard.I think I'm a bit biased, I assumed as much as soon as I heard him pimping Underoath...how someone insults a band for lacking creativity then lists Underoath as a favorite, I have no idea. But that's beside the point. Screw this kid, he has no idea what he's talking about...probably because his sweater is too tight and the blood loss from the last time he cut himself is starting to make him dizzy. As for the record itself, it's very well done. I think the mixing done for Collision Course was a little bit better, but that was done by one or two people, this is an entire rogue's gallery of hip hop quotables and well known alternative musicians and singers. Personally, I could have done without Jonathan Davis on one of my favorite Linkin Park songs, though. I will say that, while I love how far the remixes deviate from the originals, you lose a lot of the feeling put into the originals and the emotion gets muddled by the mixing and cutting and pasting...but it's a good album as far as remixes go. If you like this...check out the Jay-Z/Linkin Park Collision Course album, or the Handsome Boy Modeling School album \\"White People\\" there's a song on there that features both Mike and Chester, as well as DJ Shadow and someone else, I forget who the other MC is at the moment. But check that out if you love good collaborations. And anyone else who has a thought process similar to this MPD 360 cat or whatever the eff his name is...some things are best left kept to yourself.
6305972591|4.0|There's just something about a movie that has children killing adults and running the show that freaks everyone out. I guess it plays on the same kind of fears that movies that have bee's taking over the world do. We treat children like they're a nusance, so they rise up against their aggressors, adults, and most likely succeed because adults discredit kids. Huh......<br /><br />Well that's at least what I got from this movie.<br /><br />When I watch a horror movie I look for three basic things. First, is the acting up to par and is the movie well made? Second, how are the special effects and the death sequences? Finally, does the end of the movie deliever and wrap things up?<br /><br />In the first category this movie does really well. You can tell from the beginning that the movie was probably made on a very small budget, but the camera work, and everything else was done extremely well. The acting is also pretty good for such a low budget movie. Terminator girl does a terrific job, as well as all of the kids, especially the leader. Malaki, or the red-headed bully stumbles over his lines, but he does a half decent job. So yeah, the movie delievers here.<br /><br />* Oh, something to watch for. When the main character is running away from the children who are chasing him, and calling him lap lander, or excuse me OUT-lander, he runs into the barn. It is dark in the barn and he \\"hits\\" his head on a beam. It's incredibly hilarious because you can sooooo tell, he fakes it.<br /><br />Secondly, does the movie have decent special effects and death sequences? Yes and no. Yes because some of the special effects are pretty good, but there isn't that many of them, nor killing sequences. The kids go on a rampage in the beginning and then, that's pretty much it. There is a lot of suspense in the movie, which does creep you out, but no real need for crazy special effects. The special effects are okay. At the end they look pretty cheesy, but hey low-budget movie so what are you going to do?<br /><br />Finally does the ending wrap the movie up? This movie certainly does. It takes all the elements of the story and wraps them up into a neat pacakage at the end. Like I said, the special effects are a little cheesy but alright. It's nothing you can't see coming, but it has some little twists which keep you watching.<br /><br />So all in all, this is a pretty good movie. It's gotten a bad wrap for some reason, but there will always be a book versus movie battle for every book they turn into a movie. I never have read the book, so I can't throw my two cents in here. Anyway, it would be worth the buy at Walmart for 6.50, rather than renting it.you going to do?  <br /> <br />Finally does the ending wrap the movie up? This movie certainly does.

B000002HPT|5.0|I was hesitant at first to write a review for an album that's been out so long, but I figure since I just bought it, there's probably someone else that hasn't heard it yet.  Anyway, I have listened long and hard to this CD, and I can honestly say that there are a few songs on here that are MUST have tracks if you are a Dream Theater fan, and even if you're not.  I saw alot of reviews saying this was too mellow an album, but don't buy it.  The album kicks off with one of the band's greatest achievements, New Millenium, and doesn't stop.   <br />The album content varies and is hard to describe.  My personal favorite, \\"Trial of Tears\\" is a smooth, yet powerful 3-part track which really grasps what Dream Theater is all about.  If you like Dream Theater's heavy side, you can't go wrong with \\"Burning my Soul,\\" or the absolute shredfest, \\"Peruvian Skies.\\"  The only real forgettable tracks on here are \\"you not me,\\" and \\"lines in the sand.\\"  All in all, this is a great DT album, and definitely worth picking up even if you aren't a hardcore fan.
0440238609|5.0|These books absolutely changed my life.  They're like Harry Potter, but much better.  I saw them in the downtown Honolulu Borders store  a bunch of times, and finally decided to take the plunge and read an unrecommended, random fantasy-type book (usually a recipe for disaster!). <br /> <br />Instead, it turned out to be a life-changing experience.  I don't even like the author much, I don't believe in Humanism much, and I don't believe in his ideas of God, but I love these books. <br /> <br />If you love: <br />Narnia <br />Harry Potter <br />Star Wars <br />MMORPGs <br />good stories <br />great characters <br />etc. etc. <br /> <br />you should buy these books.
0452283760|5.0|I liked the characters so much I named a compay after the main character.  It is a great story with a great message.
0375507256|5.0|It took me a while to get into this book. I started off reading a few pages before bed and just couldn't get into it. After months of just sitting there, I brought it on a vacation and could not put it down --- I was at the third story by this time. I had to go back and reread the first two stories as I continued. Not the easiest book...definitely not for everyone. If you are a hard core reader and like a bit of a challenge get this book. You will not be disappointed.
B000CNFC76|5.0|First I will say that this film is a must-see; it is a great one.  For some reason, only five copies were made available at my local video store; as a result, this film was unavailable for a good month after it came out because it was constantly rented out.  It appeals to a wide audience on a variety of levels and is just an extremely well-done film. <br /> <br />The film is wonderfully cast.  I was already quite familiar with Shia Lebeouf from the Disney show \\"Even Stevens\\" and from the (also great) movie \\"Holes\\".  But this movie greatly heightened my appreciation for young Mr. Lebeouf; the movie is quite dramatic and intense and this young actor played the part as if he were Francis Ouimet himself.  The part of Ouimet's caddy, Eddie Lowery, was played by young Josh Flitter.  Flitter's acting shows the same integrity and maturity that his character, Lowery, seems to have had back in 1913 at that US open.  Both performances were A+. <br /> <br />Bill Paxton directed this piece and does an extraordinary job with the cinematography.  We see Harry Vardon mentally shutting all the people around him out as he concentrates on his swing; the people on camera slowly disappear as into a cloud.  We see shots made by Ted Ray take off like rockets.  We see close-ups of shots made in dense rain digging up the mud; of shots made from water spraying the water onto the air as the ball flies securely toward the hole; of shots made from the sand pits sending sand flying as well as the golf ball.  The game is at least half the movie, and it is very well filmed.  Even if you know nothing of golf, you will appreciate the filming of this piece and the sense of excitement it brings to your heart. <br /> <br />This movie actually made me want to take up golf (I have never played)...it was that good.  I give it an A+A+A+A+A+...that's five A+'s for five stars!
055357342X|4.0|About 400 pages into this book, I was already planning on writing a less than positive review. The problems I simply couldn't get over were: 1) The story is probably longer than it needs to be. 2) Lots of obviously contrived bad things happen over and over and 3) I was kind of disgusted with the sexual descriptions (for example: I don't really need to know what Tyrion's manhood looks like (Martin has to make it as grotesque as possible). By the way, have readers noticed that all the lasting & ongoing relationships in this series are of a perverted nature (brother/sister, beauty/beast, and huge age difference) while the \\"normal\\" relationships tend toward tragic results? Does this reflect Martin's real world view?<br /><br />And then at page 583, I was ready to just close the book and give up.I'm glad I didn't.<br /><br />Despite the problems, there is a good story going on here. Martin's writing is smooth and very good (despite the delving into the brutal and the perverse). He has created a rich world with rich characters. He eventually ties much of the complexity together. The plot continues to surprise me. Overall, A Storm of Swords is a very good book. I am looking forward to the rest of the series.<br /><br />Lastly, Martin has warned us at least two times that I can think of that the heroes aren't always the beautiful ones. But man, does he take this to the extreme!
0711225176|5.0|This book has it all lots of pictures as well as interesting information on Mucha and his work.  I feel that it shows how he and his work became an icon of Art Nouveau.  It is not just posters and panels that are covered it goes into every aspect of Mucha's work.  There is information and pictures on \\"The Slav Epic\\", jewellery, lead light pastels, drawings and more.  I would recommend this book to anyone that loves Mucha or Art Nouveau.
0385513755|3.0|I was impressed with the maps and illustrations in the special illustrated edition, and I would recommend it if the price is not an obstacle.<br /><br />The book itself is a pretty standard thriller (handsome professor and foxy police cryptographer join forces to discover the secret of the holy grail), but one I enjoyed reading.<br /><br />It is also, of course, a controversial book.  Author Dan Brown presents the following \\"facts\\" at the outset of the novel:<br /><br />\\"The Priory of Sion - a European secret society founded in 1099 - is a real organization.  In 1975 Paris's Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale discovered parchments known as the Les Dossiers Secrets, identifying numerous members of the Priory of Sion, including Sir Isaac Newton, Botticelli, Victor Hugo, and Leonardo da Vinci.\\"<br /><br />\\"The Vatican prelature known as Opus Dei is a deeply devout Catholic sect that has been the topic of recent controversy due to reports of brainwashing, coercion, and a dangerous practice known as `corporal mortification.'  Opus Dei has just completed construction of a $47 million National Headquarters at 243 Lexington Avenue in New York City.\\"<br /><br />\\"All descriptions of artwork, architecture, documents, and secret rituals in this novel are accurate.\\"<br /><br />The suggestion that the Priory of Sion is an authentic organization is highly disputable.  Nevertheless, at least partly on the basis of this assertion, some readers have concluded that some even more surprising speculations about the life of Jesus presented in the novel are true, or that a conservative Catholic conspiracy that figures prominently in the plot is real.  Such conclusions are poorly supported, and Brown probably could have been more careful to separate fact from fiction.  But it would be taking rather a hard line to blame Brown for trying to make his plot devices plausible.

B000EJ9MTW|5.0|These guys are the real thing.  <br /> <br />People comment on their adhearence to 70s classic rock. I agree they get that big \\"important\\" sound that has made the music of Deep Purple/ LZ / Yes so deeply meaningful for people who had the opportunity to experience it when it was first released. But there is an significant difference with WOLFMOTHERS music <br /> <br />I love these guys and this isn't meant as a criticism but they do NOT have the technical skill that was required to compete in the 70s progressive/hard rock scene. Their songs are actually quite simple and straightforward...not that difficult to imitate...and I predict that a LOT of local bands around the country will be playing WMs tunes at backyard parties this summer.. <br /> <br />,,,and thats what makes them special. <br /> <br />WOLFMOTHER has managed to create that big meaningful important sound without requiring techninical skill to \\"verify\\" it...these are great songs that are simple enough for moderately skilled musicians to pull off This is a good thing because music that CAN be played by others WILL be played by others, and hence have a big influence  (anyone wanna try to learn ELPs \\"Tarkus\\" or King Crimson's \\"Schizoid Man\\"?) <br /> <br />So the WOLFIES have somehow managed to distill all that was great about the music that those technically skilled muscians of the 70s yet combined it with  the simple do-it-yourself attitude of punk..and thats a great combination. <br /> <br />I hope that WM can avoid the temptation of trying to prove to us how great they are with many showy guitar/keyboard solos and keeps thinking in terms of 3-5 minute songs. That was a real problem with 70s music in that there was a sense that musicians had to prove how good they were instead of just playing music they liked. <br /> <br />And in regard to their \\"retro sound.\\"  I wasn't old enough in 1968 to complain that LZs first LP was basically a rehash of Willie Dixon and Chester Burnett combined with some Yardbirds out-takes, but I'm sure some knowledgeable Blues/Folk fans did complain. <br /> <br />However, just  because I know some of WMs sources I won't complain... because I think they truly have a valid artistic vision... <br /> <br />Those of us that are aware of their sources are equivilent to the people who knew in '68 that \\"Dazed and Confused\\" was a cover of a Jake Holmes song...but that doen't make the LZ version any less awesome. <br /> <br />I hope that there are  a bunch of WM rippoff bands so I can listen to more NEW music like this. And for the haters its even good because the more disagreement there is among music fans/musicians the better the output ends up being...Christ I remember I thought \\"Presence\\" sucked when it came out and I was a wise 16 year- old at the time.
B000E33VWW|4.0|Philip Seymour Hoffman is simply an outstanding actor. He portrays such a unique and quirky character - and he does it unbelievably well. Capote is quite an interesting character, himself. Eccentric, humorous and ultimately revolutionary in his craft.  <br /> <br />The story is engaging, as are the characters involved. The screenplay is exceptionally well-written, creating some very emotionally intensive scenes. Some scenes are humorous, some shocking, some uncomfortable and some utterly heart-wrenching.  This was a very entertaining movie, with stellar performances.
B00007LTIB|5.0|Growing up in the 70's allowed me to purchase so many incredible albums when they were first released.  For some reason, I didn't like this album when I first heard it.  But, in time, I have come to realize that those are the albums I eventually love the most.  Because they are so intense that one listen doesn't do them justice.  This album isn't radio-friendly (a term I detest, but is unfortunately accurate).  So it took quite a few listens to become familiar with all the complexities, and intermingled melodies.  But I finally came to understand that this is the best work the band ever did.  Forgive my naievete, but what does a 14 year old kid know of greatness??
B000E1YVZU|5.0|Being one of the few people that you have met that have actually seen the original early 90's broadway show \\"RENT\\" I can tell you honestly that in compare that this film is very different not really in a bad way but all around - different. I dont know if any of you knew this but the director of the \\"Harry Potter\\" movie also created this movie, though that does seem somewhat different he does an all around pretty d*mn good job of making this movie as good as possible.  <br /> <br />Going into the film dont expect much of anything other than over two hours of singing that supports an all around great plot. Though at some times during the film you do wish they would slow down the music a little and try to have a little bit more normal dialouge ... the music is still really wonderful and throughout the film you are more than a bit entertained. <br /> <br />I'm also sure that some of you may have heard that some of the people from the original cast played their parts in the new movie, this was overall pretty good just because all of the original performers are absolutly brilliant!, the only thing that bothers me is that in the film all of the people are supposed to be in their early twenties .... I'm sure you would agree that some of them look like they are only the verge of turning 40 or so (or at least 35...), one really suprizing thing was that they got Rosario Dawson to play a part, though I was skeptical of this choice I was overall pretty pleased with her performance not only in the acting portion but the singing as well, she is the real deal as an actress. <br /> <br />I thought that at a few parts of \\"RENT\\" that things got just a nidge jumbed mostly because the very little amount of actual dialouge (besides the singing!) .... but the singing alone makes this a great film that I would recommend to most people, except for maybe conservetive people or people that dont like musicals, do keep in mind it in some parts is a little bit riscay but it's not like ... \\"RockyHorror Picture Show\\" or anything... <br /> <br />Suprizing film! <br /> <br />Grade: A-
B0002STNQ2|4.0|Yet again, Crichton proves to be the master of suspense. !@#$ Stephen King. Michael Crichton's novel Prey is as astounding and captivating as his  <br />other books. The premise is a bit different, but it still engulfs you and sends chills down your spine. Like noted earlier, the fears in this book aren't aliens or dinosaurs, but small particles of nanotechnology. The book still packs a great amount of suspense and it is quite hard to put down. The first few chapters mainly consist of talk about his life and his family. While this is an ordinarily boring subject, Crichton does an amazing job of even making this section pulse-pounding and a true page turner. The vocabulary in the book is not too difficult. Once in a while, Crichton might try and boggle the reader with a slew of mechanical and scientific terms, but it is not anything too bad. I'm not too infatuated with science, so at first I thought this was not the right book for me. But I thought back to his other books which had scientific themes, like Jurassic Park and the Andromeda Strain, and decided to give it a chance. The book is definitely the most science based of the three, which is not necessarily a bad thing. Crichton makes it interesting to read, and you never feel bored or lost. It is an easier read than his other books, as well. In the end, Prey is a great book. It may not be up to the caliber of The Andromeda Strain or Jurassic Park in terms of overall finish and suspense, but it is a solid concept and an easy read. The mix of great characters, a solid plot, and the page turning factor make it a must. If you are looking for a great book to read on the weekend, look no further. Wiley pwns.
B00004TRD8|5.0|It's been some time since I've watched T2, but I still keep it handy near my dvd player together with other movies I watch regularly. So why haven't I watched it after all this time, well let's look at the pros and cons of T2:    Pros:    1- A successful sequel of a blockbuster T1 (check the votes).  2- A successful first use of computer animation technology (1991).    Cons:    1- More than 2 hours.  2- Noticeable difference between animatronics and animation.    I always fancied unstoppable killing machines that are believable and innovative. The T1000 liquid metal tops the list with its amazing ability to change shape and solidify at will. I even thought about the scientific feasibility of such a machine, but that only leads to contradiction with some scenes in the movie, like when Arnold shoots the T1000 to many pieces when it was frozen, you don't see a central module that supplies the energy to drive it, or an intelligence module (CPU) that contols it. And if it doesn't have a central module, then it would not need to see from its \\"eyes\\" or hear from its \\"ears\\", its entire body can be used to sense the world around it. Other than that, great movie with great special effects.
B000EPR7NE|5.0|As a Hans Zimmer fan, I eagerly count the days till the release of a Zimmer score, or any Media Ventures score for that matter. Zimmer's work on The Da Vinci Code reunites him for the second time with director Ron Howard. It strikes me odd that Ron Howard didn't develop a continuing collaboration with Zimmer after Backdraft considering the success of that film. Hans Zimmer is known for establishing great working relationships with directors such as Ridley Scott, John Woo, Antoine Fuqua, Gore Verbinski, and Penny Marshall.<br /><br />The score is unique and borrows elements from his previous scores to Hannibal, The Ring, and Batman Begins. It's not the bombastic action score we've come to expect from Zimmer, then again this is not a bombastic action movie. Zimmer creates tension with most of the tracks, and he adds a Latin choir to some tracks to set the religious tone of the film. In fact, the British Film censors said that the filmmakers had to tone down Zimmer's score in the film if they wanted to get a 12A rating versus a 15. I've never heard of a film's score affecting the rating of a film. Track 7, \\"Salvete Virgines\\", is a perfect example of the choir even though it is not used in the film. Another highlight of the album is track 10, \\"The Citrine Cross\\", where we get a little glimpse of trademark Zimmer in probably the most \\"action\\" oriented track. The second to last track, \\"Chevaliers De Sangreal\\", is my favorite cue on the album. Any Zimmer fan could pick that track out of a lineup and say 'that's Hans Zimmer'. It reminded me of \\"Journey To The Line\\" from his score to The Thin Red Line, not in tone but in structure. It builds slowly and continues to build into a full blown beautiful mixture of orchestration and digital synthesization. When I first listened to that track it sent chills down my spine, it did the same thing to me in the film.<br /><br />Hans Zimmer is my favorite composer of all time, he is truly a gifted artist who continues to be the leader in modern film music composition. Zimmer's first score for 2006 is a beautiful subtle piece of music, and it will please Zimmer fans till we get his score release for Pirates Of The Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest in July.ic composition.

076790592X|4.0|This book is a collaberation between a college professor and his former student - Morrie and Mitch. They taped their visits everytime Mitch was there. They talked about big questions of life (what is love, living, death, marriage, a relationship) to the small ones (what's for lunch, how's your wife, how's your son, and the war in Bosnia).  <br /> <br />Mitch, the former student, rediscovered the relationship that had never been broken. Morrie, the professor, rediscovered his old friend. And it was this time when Mitch found out what he loved to do most, that is to teach. <br /> <br />I loved the last line of the book. It is indeed a perfect epitaph -  a teacher until the end. <br /> <br />Tuesdays with Morrie is, without a doubt one of the good books that was ever written. It makes you cry and kind of feel depressed because it deals with death but then again, not so much because it tells you a lot of things that cover up death.  <br /> <br />It is a short read and worth it.
0446693804|5.0|I don't think I have ever really cried while reading a book, but with this story I had to pull out the box of tissues.  This is such a powerful story about not only the strange places we find love, but how it can't truly change our lives.  I received this book as a gag gift from a friend and had just thrown it to the side.  After I had read \\"The Notebook,\\" which is also by Sparks, I thought I should give this one a try too and maybe I would love it just as much.  Well, I started and couldn't stop.  For the two days that it took me to read it I was completely entwined in the story of Jamie and Landon, the two high school sweethearts who found each other in the least likely of circumstances.  I think they found what so many are looking for.  I recommend this book to anyone who, like me, sometimes need to be reminded what true love looks and feels like.  Just don't forget your box of tissues.  <br />

1400049628|5.0|Perhaps the greatest quality of this book is its ability to never slip out of its sober mask.  At no point does Max Brooks entertain the notion that this is fiction.  He treats his subject matter with the kind of practical seriousness one might expect from a military manual.  This makes it very charming and, ironically, hysterical. <br /> <br />The guide is filled with accurate information on basic survival and preparation.  MB obviously spent a lot of time studying pre-Y2K survival manuals.  It covers everything from which weapons are best suited to zombie defense, to what must be done to ensure survival in a home/school/government building/apartment.  There're articles on vehicle choices, armor options, methods of defense and attack, crisis management in light of a zombie outbreak, and the \\"true\\" cause of zombies.  Max Brooks even goes so far as to dispel all the misinformation provided to us by pop culture, Hollywood, and legends.  There are also great bits on firearms, types of arms and armor available, and practical advice on how to start life anew. <br /> <br />What really seals the deal, though, is the collection of incident reports at the back of the book.  Fictional, of course, but if you didn't know better, you'd think MB was dead serious.  This compilation of supposed \\"zombie encounters\\" are as Van Dam as the rest of the book. <br /> <br />Plus, it comes in a nice Quality Paperback form with a rustic para-military cover design and great faded fonts. <br /> <br />Sober, lakonic, and vastly entertaining, this one is worth buying new and reading several times.  Purchase it, read it twice, then stick it in your hiking pack, 'cause you never know when zombies will shamble up to your door.  You might have to make a break for it, and when you do you'll want this guide on-hand to provide you with all the necessities to stem the tide of the living dead.
0312983867|3.0|I had been told about Janet Evanovich over a year ago and was encouraged to read her Stephanie Plum series.  Life got in the way and when I did have time to read, I was playing catch up with my favorite authors - I had no time to start a book by a new author.  I continued to collect the series whenever I'd find one of the books at a library sale or yard sale. Recently, I decided they were taking up too much space on my overcrowded bookshelf, so I plunged into the series with ONE FOR THE MONEY.  That was about 3 weeks ago, and I've loved the books so much, I've read them back to back.  I finished HARD EIGHT last night and have to say this is the first one that was a disappointment.<br /><br />In HARD EIGHT, Stephanie Plum, bumbling Bounty Hunter with more luck than skill, is on the hunt for a couple of FTA's (people who Failed to Appear for their court appearance and are now in violation of their bond).  The cases in HARD EIGHT are not memorable and soon forgotten.  Usually there is a FTA that gives Stephanie a hard time and is very fun to read about - not so with this book.  The main story focuses around Stephanie agreeing to look for her parent's neighbor's daughter and granddaughter (Evelyn and Annie) who may be in danger from the ex-husband (Paul).  Stephanie realizes it's not just a case of child custody when she comes up against Eddie Abruzzi, their landlord and an all around nasty guy who seems more like a mobster than a businessman.  Eddie decides to torment Stephanie and begins his crusade to get her to cave in and leave the case.  The bag of snakes left at her door and the large tarantulas left in her car don't do the trick, so he has a guy dressed in a bunny suit harassing her.  Hmmm... maybe Stephanie shouldn't have told him she liked bunnies.<br /><br />We've seen in this series that Stephanie has an on-again, off-again romance with Joe Morelli, a local bad boy turned good cop.  The reader can almost feel the electrical current flowing between these two.  Tossed into the mix is Ranger, a bounty hunter who has taken Stephanie under his wing.  Ranger has more mystery than the plot lines.  No one knows where he lives, how he gets the expensive cars he drives, or really much about him.  In HARD EIGHT, since Stephanie and Morelli are off again and not talking, Ranger seems to be more in the forefront of the romantic race to gain Stephanie's affections.  But even this interlude is lacking... I found Ranger to be out of character in this book where Stephanie is concerned.<br /><br />Character development is one of the things Evanovich does well.  The characters of Stephanie, Joe Morelli, and Ranger are so well developed they feel like part of the family.  The cast of support characters are also well done and make each of the books feel like you're invited right into the plot.  Lula, the large black friend of Stephanie is a riot - she's an ex \\"ho\\" who tells it like it is, but she's more bark than bite.  Vinnie, the owner of Vincent Plum Bail Bonds and uncle to Stephanie, is a sleazy guy but one can't help but smile at his antics.  Stephanie's mother and father are interesting, but the best family member has to be Grandma Mazur.  Someday I want to be a grandma like that!  She's out to have a good time no matter what people think and she always says what's on her mind.  She's great!  Connie, the office manager at the bail bond office, is the only support character who hasn't been well developed.<br /><br />Even though this series is light on the mystery portions, it is filled with fun and hilarious scenes.  You cannot read one of these books without laughing through at least one part.<br /><br />Out of the first eight books, this one I liked the least.  It's short on plot development and seems to focus more on character interaction.  Overall it's forgettable with the exception of Ranger and Morelli still vying for Stephanie's attentions... and even that was a bit lacking in this book!<br /><br />And what does the title of these books have to do with the stories?  I have yet to figure that one out!the title of these books have to do with the stories?  I have yet to figure that one out! <br /> <br />
6304698690|2.0|This version of The Secret Garden should be titled \\"Ms. Burnett goes to Hollywood\\".  It's overwrought and clichd.   If one has been raised on a steady diet of Saturday morning cartoons, this film will appeal.  Otherwise, get the BBC version.  While it was obviously made with a much lower budget, the BBC version is FAR more faithful to the original story, the actors have the correct regional accents, and it captures the magic much better.

He knew my reputation.\\" <br /> <br /> <br />Nathaniel, a young 11 year-old magician's apprentice is living in a different London where magicians rule the country. He summons a djinni (a spirit) by the name of Bartimaeus. He summons him because he wants Bartimaeus to steal something of Simon Lovelace, a higher magician that embarrassed Nathaniel in a cruel way. Bartimaeus ends up stealing the Amulet of Samarkand. However Nathaniel and Bartimaeus end up in a winding plot that gets them deeper into the story behind the amulet and Simon, winding them between murders, espionage, and making adversaries in the British government.  Having his master getting killed and losing the amulet to Simon, he wants to find out what the vile magician is planning on using it for. He then realizes that Simon has a plot to do something horrible to the government and must do something before it is too late. <br /> <br />The book Amulet of Samarkand is an excellent book. It is fast paced and has you pouring into each page with awe and suspense to see what happens next. Another reason why it is a good book is that it is written from Bartimaeus and Nathaniel's perspectives throughout the book, leaving each one of their accounts off with a suspenseful end.  The genre of this book is Fantasy, set in modern times. This book is well written and is the first book in the Bartimaeus trilogy. However, I would recommend that you read these books in order, first starting out with this and then moving onto The Golem's Eye finishing up the trilogy with Ptolemy's Gate. My opinion of this book is that it is slightly hard to get into but then picks up. It is different than most teen fantasy books that I have read. The plot has a lot of conspiracies embedded in it. The book gave different emotions from seeing it from the two main character's perspectives. All in all, this book is a great book and I recommend it to any one who likes to read fantasies with a twist.     <br />
1400079179|5.0|As an active Mormon (Latter-Day Saint), I could not put down this book, because for me the basis of the story is NOT FICTIONAL. Mormons who know thier history know that Brigham Young and other Mormon apostles revealed that Jesus Christ was married to Mary Magdaline and other women had had children. (See refernces below). I could not wonder if it was a coincidence that Brown came up with the basic idea for his plot from reserching old Mormon documents. Regardless, it make the book even more special and brings our doctrine to to life even though the rest of his story is obviously fiction. This book gave me goosebumps! I highly recccomend this book to other LDS members and if you are not LDS, when you read this imagine that it is really based on fact. It will make it even more exciting. I give it the highest rating!<br /><br />Statements by LDS (Mormon) General Authorities that Jesus was married during his lifetime and ministry on earth:<br /><br />The First Presidency and Apostles and other leading authorities of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints solemnly proclaim that Jesus Christ was married to Mary magdaline in mortality, had children, and was a polygamist.<br /><br />LDS Apostle Orson Hyde stated in a LDS conference address: \\"I discover that some of the Eastern papers represent me as a great blasphemer, because I said, in my lecture on Marriage, at our last Conference, that Jesus Christ was married at Cana of Galilee, that Mary, Martha, and others were his wives, and that he begat children.<br /><br />All that I have to say in reply to that charge is this  they worship a Savior that is too pure and holy to fulfill the commands of his Father. I worship one that is just pure and holy enough \\"to fulfill all righteousness;\\" not only the righteous law of baptism, but the still more righteous and important law \\"to multiply and replenish the earth\\" (Journal of Discourses vol. 2, p.210).<br /><br />\\"Sermon by President Orson Hyde, The Judgments of God on the United States-The Saints and the World\\" A Sermon by President Orson Hyde, Delivered in the Tabernacle, Great Salt Lake City, March 18, 1855.

Grant, second counselor to LDS Church President Brigham Young, made these comments in the Salt Lake Tabernacle on Temple Square: \\"Celsus was a heathen philosopher; and what does he say upon the subject of Christ and his Apostles.... He says, \\"The grand reason why the Gentiles and philosophers of his school persecuted Jesus Christ, was, because he had so many wives; there were Elizabeth, and Mary, and a host of others that followed him.\\" ...<br /><br />The grand reason of the burst of public sentiment in anathemas upon Christ and his disciples, causing his crucifixion, was evidently based on polygamy.... A belief in the doctrine of a plurality of wives caused the persecution of Jesus, and his followers. We might almost think they were \\"Mormons\\".

If he was never married, his intimacy with Mary and Martha, and the other Mary also whom Jesus loved, must have been highly unbecoming and improper to say the least of it. I will venture to say that if Jesus Christ were now to pass through the most pious countries in Christendom with a train of women, such as used to follow him, ... he would be mobbed, tarred, and feathered, and rode not on an ass, but on a rail....At this doctrine the long faced hypocrite and the sanctimonious bigot will probably cry, blasphemy! ...

B000B9EY2U|5.0|I have been listening to DM for many years and this time something possessed me to buy one of their albums.(my sis has many) Now, if someone wanted to by it from me I wouldn't sell it for the world!  I think all the album is worth listening to. buy this one you wont be sorry!!
1400079179|3.0|It's not a bad thriller, albeit slow-paced and structurally inferior to some of Brown's earlier writing. What is ultimately lacks, on all levels, is authenticity: It is less convincing as a political conspiracy novel than, say, \\"The Day of the Jackal\\"; much less readable as literature than \\"Harry Potter\\"; less reliable as history than the average period bodice-ripper. So why has it sold millions? Pure quantum mechanics - no more predictable than a lottery win. Read it if you must - there are far worse pot-boilers on the station bookshelf - but don't let it change your worldview. If you want a philosophical yarn that means something, try \\"Sophie's World\\" or (for post-hippy masochists) \\"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\\".

Once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down.  Then the movie came out. The movie is still a good movie, but, the book is much much better. The book is set back in earlier times, where as the movie is present day.  Still a good movie, but the book is 10000 times Better!!!
0060589280|5.0|\\"Eleven Minutes\\" is a moving tale about a young Brazilian woman who, at the behest of a complete stranger, travels to Europe to become a \\"famous\\" Samba dancer. Woven into the story are her personal journals, which serve to tie the novel together while seducing the reader into a suspension of disbelief over her sometimes incredible actions and decisions. They are what we pay most attention to, and they are the threading that binds \\"Eleven Minutes.\\" The reader will personalize this dialog because it speaks a universal language that all of us face' particularly during times of vulnerability, when we feel overwhelmed, or when cynicism jades our process of growth. While the set-up may be simple, the emotional and intellectual roller-coaster is anything BUT. All of us can tell you about a trip to, say, the dry cleaners, but rarely do you hear about the oftentimes complex inner dialog along the way, i.e., Is my marriage salvageable? Have I sold out on my ideals? Why can't I have an orgasm with my husband? Do I have an affair?...etc. This is not a lighthearted read. But it is intensely passionate, sensual, blatantly erotic, and intellectually rewarding. For example, there are a series of scenes that explore the nature of Sado-Masochism and its corruptive use of guilt to exploit pleasure. The scenes are as titillating and seductive as they are revealing of the influences behind such behavior. Fundamentally, it lavishes upon the reader volumes about the nature of both love and sex and, most importantly, sex in the context of love [Sacred Sex], and what it means to live life without fear in order to achieve it. There were moments when I was shaken by the writer's extraordinary insights and impassioned dialog, and came away from the experience feeling the need to revisit [yet again] my own inner dialog on Sacred Sex. I rated the book 5 stars because of its depth - in spite of the fact that I was often distracted by the writer's voice. Whether Eleven Minutes is a personal dissertation on the nature of sex and love using a story as a vehicle, or just a coming of age love story about the foibles of youth told, ultimately, through a series of intimate journals, you'll have to decide. Regardless, it is a must read for anyone who embraces self-discovery.tation on the nature of sex and love using a story as a vehicle, or just a coming of age love story about the foibles of youth told, ultimately, through a series of intimate journals, you'll have to decide.

B000FFJ82Q|5.0|This is a sensational, sci-fi, alien invasion, action film with a terrific cast and superlative special effects. Alien invaders suddenly darken the skyline across the world, as city sized flying saucers hover ominously over major cities world wide. A computer geek, David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum), figures out how the alien ships are communicating with each other and realizes the import of what he has discovered. He manages to have an audience with President Whitmore (Bill Pullam), as his ex-wife is one of the president's top aides, and tells the president of his findings. Wonder at the alien saucer spectacle turns to terror, as the meaning of the ships in the sky becomes clear.<br /><br />The White House evacuates just in time, as the aliens launch a world wide attack in complete synchronization, an awesome spectacle that enthralls the viewer. A counter attack is launched, led by fighter pilot Captain Steve Hiller (Will Smith), which ends in disaster for the fighter pilots, as only Hiller survives to fight another day. He manages, however, to bring in a captive. Notwithstanding the gravity of the premise of the film, there are moments of comic relief interspersed throughout.<br /><br />Meanwhile, our computer geek, realizing why the counter attack failed, comes up with a solution, one that requires nerves of steel and a desire to walk on the wild side. A second counter attack is launched world wide, which leads to some terrific action scenes and heroics by a most unlikely candidate. Naturally, mankind is victorious. It is not the victory itself, however, but what leads up to the victory that makes the film so entertaining.<br /><br />This is a fast paced film with a myriad of subplots and coincidental pairings that may stretch the viewer's credence but do not take away from the enjoyment of the film. The special effects are dazzling. The cast is excellent. Will Smith is charming and funny throughout. Bill Pullam is appropriately presidential, and Jeff Goldblum is a most convincing computer geek. Look for fine performances from the stellar supporting cast: Mary McConnell, Robert Loggia, Margaret Colin, Randy Quaid, Judd Hirsch, James Rebhorn, Harry Connick, Jr., and Harvey Fierstein. All in all, this is a terrific alien invasion film and well worth having in one's collection.<br /><br />Be prepared for an unintended poignant moment in the film, when the camera pans to the New York skyline and the viewer sees the World Trade Center twin towers standing proud and tall on the horizon. It is a moment that gives the viewer pause in remembrance of what was. It is, indeed, a moment to remember.ost convincing computer geek.

B000B8QG0O|5.0|Toy Story 2 is just as good as (or even better than) Toy Story 1.  Great animation, very funny and teaches valuable lessons without the sadness.  Some of the animated movies have scenes that are hard to watch, for example the opening scene in Finding Nemo or the beginning of Tarzan.  My son watches those scenes in horror (and so do I).  Toy Story 2 and Toy Story 1 have such an original storyline that is so endearing, and it is such a well rounded movie that it is an excellent pick for all.  I also like the fact that the toys don't sing and dance as in most animated movies, and yet the music is excellent.  I particularly love the song (composer: Randy Newman) when Buzz realizes he is just a toy and can't fly and tries to fly out the window.  Me and my son play along to that part!
B0002OERI0|4.0|This kinda music generally isn't my thing, but what can I say I like this album.  It's fun and catchy, not much more than that, but that's enough.  The hype surrounding this album is quite hilarious, however.  A mainstream band displays a sliver of ambition and the mainstream press sh*ts itself.  WOW! Some of these songs are like 3 Green Day songs one right after another.  They used a pianny!  Amazing!!!  The most ambitious, sophisticated album of the year!!  Seriously, the appeal of this album is very simple:  Most of the songs here have a part, usually the chorus, which you remember after the song is over, and it is not an unpleasant memory.  Ta-da!  That said, it's not 100% consistent with a couple fairly uninspired tracks wedged in the middle i.e. 'Are we the Waiting', 'St. Jimmy', 'She's A Rebel' and 'Extraordinary Girl'.  But it's pretty solid other than those tracks.  The two epics are pretty effective if, again, not 1/10th as revolutionary or innovative as you may have been told.  'Holiday' is probably the best song here.  Again, just a catchy chorus and some relatively effective verses.  (It's substantially hurt by the cringe-inducing political lyrics of the middle section, but the rest of the song is good enough to make me ignore that crap.  Make no mistake, I'm no Bush fan, but I don't like retard pinko punks either, so we'll call it a draw.  Fortunately, most of the album isn't overtly political, again despite what you may have heard.)  Classically styled pop-punk track 'Letterbomb' is one of the better, more forgotten tracks, and the numerous ballads generally prove fairly good in spite of Billy's vocal limitations.<br /><br />Yeah, that's it.  This album is pleasant to listen to, but nothin' to get too excited about.

All these years later it holds up perfectly. If this was released now no doubt Cole would probably be a superstar...well hopefully not a modern superstar but you know what I mean. One of the most under listened to albums of the 1980's. Honestly I cannot think of a decade like the 80's without Rattlesnakes. Thanks Lloyd.

B000AMJG4Y|5.0|As my title says: the Animation is Superb! and its mesmerizing. It is a highly fast paced movie so you will have to pay close attention to not miss any of the details of the action which there is a lot of. The story itself is a bit confusing especially if you've never played the video game before, so be aware of that. There are a few odd characters... but all in all the voice choices for the English cast are very nice and do a decent job of lip synching to what was originally done in Japanese. I find it very difficult to decide wether Final Fantasy the Spirits Within or Final Fantasy Advent Children is the better movie. One has an easier to follow story but the animation in the later has surpased the first, especially in the cloth generation. As a student of 3D animation and a big fan of Anime I have to say that I LOVE this movie and it's a must have for gamers/anime lovers/animation freaks/action seekers, and so forth! I thank Amazon.com for providing a great price on it too. Its at the top of my collection now!<br /><br />I recommend this movie for the ages of 16 and up, there is not much blood or to awful of language, but it simply is to hard to grasp for any younger, unless you want a flood of questions afterward. Enjoy!
B00006CXXU|5.0|I love Christina's voice and while I liked her first release album, it was only because of her voice and not so much because of the music.  There were only a few songs on the first CD I loved.  So when I purchased this one, again I thought, well I will like it because of her voice.  I was certainly in for a surprise!  Christina has effectively evolved from a teen queen to a full-fledged superstar vocalist and writer.  The songs are deep and filled with meaning.  They inspire yet capture your attention. The music is launching and compelling and you really get a look deep inside of Christina.  This is a first rate and way above the cut CD that everyone must have for their collection.  My favorites are:  CAN'T HOLD US DOWN; FIGHTER; INFATUATION; and SOAR although every single cut on this CD sparkles and is worth listening too not just because you love her voice but because of the depth of the meaning behind the words and the soulful way she sells it to you.  I listen to this CD over and over again and have put it on my iPod and never get tired of it.

Every episode is exciting and will keep you at the edge of yopur seat. This is a must buy I am definatly buying it. Make a good choice and you should too.
6305718954|5.0|I'm sorry to say, the critics bashed this movie to the ground. In fact, they did it so blatently hard that Stigmata did horrible in the box office.  Many people go by what the critics say and Stigmata is living proof that you shouldn't, this is a very entertaining film so don't listen to everyone. And as you can see, the Amazon readers \\"for the most part\\" seem to enjoy the movie more than the big guys do. I've heard comments that \\"people enjoyed the movie when it came to DVD moreso than they did when they watched it on the big screen. Why is this? I'm not really sure. Maybe it seems more like a made for \\"TV Movie\\" but I don't feel that is the case. It doesn't seem to be a \\"cheaply\\" made movie by any means and the actors are known. Nonetheless... <br /> <br />It's no Exoricst or Gone with The Wind, but Stigmata is fun and anyone that enjoys a tale about religion/horror movie in general, should give it a chance. Gabriel Burne (Father Andrew Kiernan) plays the role of the slash scientist/priest quite well. I always thought he was a wonderful actor. He also played Satan in End of Days and played a big role in \\"Point of No Return\\" with Bridgette Fonda. His wonderful acting skills are very well done. This great popcorn movie puts a stab into religion in general and some might be offended, but remember, it's just a movie!!! Once again, the Catholics are attacked, but it's all believeable and fun at the same time. Patrica Arquette does a substantial job as her role as a self admitting atheist who gets inflicted with the Stygmata. A simple hairdresser brought into the madness.  <br /> <br />She kind of looks bored through some her scenes and she needs to show a little more emotion and spunk in my opinion, but \\"Gabriel\\" saves most of the scenes when they are both together. The movie takes a lot of it's general ideas from the Exorcist, same idea, just a different time and infliction only now with a twist.  I felt the movie is very suspenseful, clever, dramatic and the acting is very well done. This movie won't bring you any closer to God, that's not what it's trying to do, it's just trying to do something different and fun, and I think Stigmata succeeds! Buy it now if you haven't seen it. Good stuff.
B000F48CD8|4.0|This very well may be what you're craving. Since I had heard of the collaboration between White and Benson, I have anxiously been awaiting the smallest snippet of a song. \\"Steady, As She Goes\\" and its B-side \\"Store Bought Bones\\" completely lived up to and exceeded my expectations. And don't get me wrong - the other eight songs on this album are all amazing in their own right. However, I will agree with other reviewers that, at less than 34 minutes running time and 10 total tracks, this album fell a bit shy of my expectations. I think that two or three additional tracks, assuming that they were two or three of the album's stronger songs, would have easily made this album a 5 star classic. I just figured that a collaboration between these two songsmiths, along with the exceptional talents of Lawrence and Wheeler, would have birthed four albums worth of material, leaving them to cherry pick the best of the best (i.e. much more than 34 minutes worth of music). Regardless, it's still an amazing album - I just had to listen to it 3 more times after the first listen left me only wanting more. I guess that's why I normally refrain from having expectations in the first place...
B000E1ZBH2|5.0|This movie is the movie that I have been looking for my entire life! <br /> <br />I typically get obsessed over CDs, not DVDs. But I have watched this movie for three straight weeks, every day. I cannot stop. My husband thinks I am a freak.  <br /> <br />First, I have never seen the BBC movie. Also, I have never read the book. Therefore, I have nothing to judge it against.  <br /> <br />The choice of actors is superb. Every actor for every character is just perfect. I love Keira Knightley as Miss Elizabeth. She is beautiful in the movie, especially her eyes. She talks so brilliantly. The way she accents certain letters at the end of some words, greatness. She definitely deserved the academy award nomination. Matthew Macfadyen as Mr. Darcy is wonderful. His looks grow on you. I now think of him as one of the most handsome actors today. When I look at his blue eyes, I go into a trance. Also, his manner of saying \\"Miss Elizabeth\\" makes me want to melt. Knightley's and Macfadyen's chemistry stands out in this movie and it makes you want to long for them to get together. <br /> <br />The rain scene is extremely powerful. Their choice of words makes your heart scream. But the ending is even better... <br /> <br />
B000E97Y6K|4.0|A fun fantasy flick with truly good animal special effects albeit cartoonish landscape ones.  The dinosaurs, bugs and especially KK seem genuinely alive moreso than even \\"Jurassic Park,\\" and that's saying something.  As the movie unfolds the relationship between the delectable Ms. Watts and the hulking King draws you in and, at the end, you're sympathetic for the big guy. <br /> <br />That said, some of the other acting and especially the character of the director are cartoonish and unpersuasive.  And it's a wonder Ms. Watts' clothes stay on as much as they do given all the Perils of Pauline she goes through.  Much less why her arms aren't torn out their sockets as Kong tosses her around.  1930's-era New York City is especially well and entertainingly depicted, in light and detail as opposed to the dark Gothams of the \\"Batman\\" franchise. <br /> <br />Hey, this movie succeeds as well-done, over the top entertainment, and that is what it's supposed to do, isn't it?
B000E41MS6|5.0|I have been watching Dr Who since 1980. I have every episode and movie \\"lost\\" or otherwise that is available. Of course I could not wait for the US release, and got mine out of country. The show is different than the originals, and as much as I love the original I think this season is the best. The stories are wonderful (yes some are better than others) Captian Jack is great. The final scene with Rose in episode 13 is one of the finest moments in 27 seasons. The tardis packaging and the widescreen format are an added plus. I think the price for the season is a real bargain for fans.
B000E1155E|2.0|All hype and no bark. That's Arctic Monkeys. Riding a wave of unprecendented hype given to them at home by the U.K. press, these lads stormed the U.S. intent with setting off a bang and raising nary a whimper. These guys are doing nothing that hasn't been done before. And in better fashion.  The lyrical content of the album received many kudos from U.K. reviewers for their 'perceptive' look at the lives of British youth.  Meh. Pulp, Blur, the great punk bands of the 1970s and Ray Davies have done this already. And, like I said, they've done it in a far more eloquent fashion than these vacuous excuses for songs.  As for the music. It's your typical mid-2000s British garage scene sound. In other words, boring.  After you've read the countless reviews and articles in the U.K. press on these guys, you expect to hear a groundbreaking rock album. Nothing could be further from the truth. Yet another case of the Emperor's New Clothes and further proof of the sad, sad decline of the once great British rock scene.  <br /> <br />Move along folks, there's nothing to see here.
B000F48CD8|5.0|Just picked this one up yesterday, great album, great musicians. A fun album to listen to on a nice summer day.  Jack White does it (yet) again, showing his range and musical talent.
B000FL7CAK|5.0|This in my opinion is the best show on television- I am a faithful viewer and every week I cannot wait for the new episodes.   <br />The actors bring such depth to the characters they play I true enjoy the show week after week.  The relationships that have been formed over the two seasons are wonderful.  The love and friendships these teens share is remarkable. <br />Rob Thomas draws you in with a mystery and then follows up the mystery with interpersonal communication.  The love hate between Veronica and Logan is my personal favorite (I enjoy the love more then the hate)!!
B000002IST|3.0|I like Genesis very much, both Gabriel's and Collins' era. Of course we all must admit that the first era with PG was much more exuberant and richer musically (no Collins' era album deserves 5 stars - except the two with Hackett, of course - but a fair amount of songs actually do), the simplification of their sound was natural, specially after Steve Hackett left the band. I disagree with all reviews that bash Collins' era albums with the only argument that is comparing The Musical Box, or Cinema Show with Invisible Touch. Come on be real, it was the 80s! Do you imagine Genesis composing The Lamb Dies Down in that plastic decade? Such an album would have been out of place, no matter musical quality, only adored by most hardcore fans, I'm sure of that (80s band, Marillion, a 70s-Genesis-like very good group reached a little more attention than cult band status). And besides, Genesis already had more than proven themeselves to the world. The times changed and the band evolved, for better or worse, no one can deny their constant success until this work and its tour.     Now about this album, there are two great songs that are Fading Lights and Driving the Last Spike (5 stars for these). These two songs are just as good as any classic Genesis, I can almost hear P Gabriel in Driving The Last Spike in the verse 'We've worked, how we worked like the devil for our pay'! The instrumental middle section of Fading Lights showed the band was still at the top of its game. There are other very good songs like No Son of Mine and Jesus He Knows Me (which lyrics I strongly agree to) and standard good quality modern soft rock tunes and ballads from which Dreaming While You Sleep and Hold On My Heart are highlights. But, there is also considerable amount of filler: Never a Time, Tell Me Why, Since I Lost You and finally Way of the World, this last is not that bad, but could have been much better. Remove these songs from the playlist and you have a very good record (their best since Abacab), not very progressive, except Fading Lights and some passages here and there.  CD technology ruined a lot of albums, because bands can put all the filler in; when albums were made for LPs, maximum 51 minutes, all music was selected carefully, only the best tracks of the recording sessions made it. This is one of the albums that suffered from the opposite, too long and filled up with the unessential.  All this said, this album and all Collins' era albums contain some great music from one of the best bands that the world knowed, no matter if there were 5, 4 or three guys.
1400079179|1.0|You know a book is bad when you can put it down with only 10 pages left.<br /><br />Never again will I read a book just to see what all the fuss is about.<br /><br />The popularity of this book shows the devastating impact reality TV has had on the intellect of the masses.<br /><br />Most people will watch anything and read so little that books like this become best sellers.<br /><br />Seriously, that was terrible.<br /><br />Don't do it.
0316776963|2.0|I picked this book up at the airport, seeing as my only other alternatives were One Minute Millionare and the Da Vinci Code. 10 minutes into the book, I wished I had opted for one of the other two, as they may have brought me *some* satisfaction, however brief. Sedaris' book is neither: a) funny; b) irreverent or penetrating, as the heavy marketing of both his books implies; nor c) well-written. Its rather disconcerting that the book is full of such rave reviews from established publications. The guy at the Wall Street Journal who said it was the funniest thing he ever read seriously needs to get out (and read) more.
B00070DK1E|5.0|I like my rock heavy and since this won best metal album of the year oh some 20 years ago now (if I remember correctly), it had to be good right?<br /><br />Well it is good, exceptional good that is and what a surprise, it's is not metal, go figure?! What we have here is a heaping mound of Tull that is a slight change from what we're used to. Simply put, this entire cd from start to finish is excellent. All the tunes are great with Budapest and She Said She Was Dancer being simply fantastic. Yes it's a different Tull sound in some ways as it's perhaps a little heavier sounding in spots, however the darn thing rocks big time. I really can't say enough about this release, it's just that good. If I had to keep just one Tull cd, this would be the one but that's probably because I like prog bands with some edge to their sound and this cd has that.<br /><br />This remastered edition is very cool with added notes and pics as well as a bonus track that fits in with the rest with ease.<br /><br />If you like prog rock Tull style, you'll love this cd.
B000002HMH|3.0|Y'all need to stop hatin' on a band because they have evolved as musicians and as people. Start judging the music by the music and not the band creating it. I'll admit i was skeptical when i seen the magazine covers and heard the rumors,\\"Metallica has sold out, they have cut thier hair, thier drinking mixed drinks on the back of the album, they suck now\\". They didn't sell out!!! They made a risky move by releasing this album but it's what they felt like doing as artists and i respect that. I think it worked out. I made a mistake and didn't purchase this album for like a year or 2. I went to the mall with my cousin one day and he told me that the album was worth buying. So i bought it and i was ashamed that i didn't buy it sooner. Metallica's best songs are on thier fist 4 albums but this album definitely has some TUNES on it. All y'all that think this album is garbage are just flat out WRONG. P E A C E
B000301YY8|3.0|I have a love hate relationship with the song Your Beautiful, I dont know whether I like, or hate it? a bit on the whiney side the lyrics or simple enough to have been writen by a teen, had Blount been a teen idol I think he would have faired much better. <br />Dont like his voice either, no wonder he didnt get the girl with that voice. <br /> <br />I think years from now people are going to look back on this song Your Beautiful, and the rest of the album and think that it was one of the worst songs and albums ever produced along the same lines as that song Feelings, \\"Woe woe woe feelings\\" just play it over and over long enough, you`ll see.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Tool, w/ 10,000 days keeps getting better.  This after about 5 listens is my favorite TOOL album of all time.  Just a tad better than Lateralus.  The reason I am anamored with 10,000 days is that I feel Tool's music to me is more like a movie soundtrack or story.  I feel this started w/ Lateralus and continues here.  Yet this album has a few more chapter's thatn Lateralus.  Tool has always been my favorite band and now it seems I'm not alone.  A good first week for a new release for a band that gets absolutely no radio play in Hawaii where I am from.

B00005JLH3|5.0|Made me want to watch this again and again.  I really enjoyed this movie.
B000002I25|5.0|This is an absolutely amazing recording. No matter how many times I have listened to this recording, the music always seems fresh and raw and powerful. You cannot listen to this CD with just the ears alone; you have to listen with your soul, your mind, your heart. Morrison's lyrics creep deeply into the psyche and find a home there that is impossible to remove because once you've listened to this recording all the way through you will never be the same again. I used to listen to it as an angry teenager because I felt it gave me a voice because I felt too disempowered to speak for myself. Now, in my 40s I just appreciate how hauntingly gorgeous and lush and full each song really is. This finite world is about loss and saddness and heartache, but the real trick to surviving all this change is to go back to the Spirit world where things can't change...where loss can't remove us from the seat of glory...where tragedy loses its sting.<br /><br />I often wonder what Jim Morrison would've \\"grown up\\" to be if he managed to live on...that's idle speculation of course and it doesn't really matter because while he was here, he created magic and fire and the world hasn't been the same since and that's a good thing.<br /><br />If you don't have this CD in your collection, this is a definite requirement. It is always in my five disc changer and has been since 1992 when I broke down and finally converted from vinyl to digital...talk about loss and heartache!<br /><br />But anyway,  may you live your life fully and completely; may you court the muse in you and dream with the gods of fire and imagination.<br /><br />Peace & Blessings
B000F48CD8|4.0|I listened today this fantastic album of this new band. I'm a fan of Jack White work. He is a man who dedicates his life to revive the best 60 & 70 hard & acoustic rock. The best example is this past project: White Stripes. I like most of the white stripes albums. I don't listen the work of Brendan Benson ... but I imagine were is the objective of his life. Revive the best Beatles rock. I like both objectives & I hear this two objectives in this debut album. Sounds very familiar, but sounds very mordern in the same time. There are a good mix of styles: Rock in the same style of Led Zeppelin Physical Graffiti, acoustic songs in the style of The Beatles White Album & grounge record process. <br />This album is ideal for rock & indie rock fans, grounge rock fans & lovers of the 70 rock bands. <br />Good luck The Raconteurs. ;) <br />
0780622553|3.0|\\"Dark City\\" is a beguiling movie for its first half - it's one of those movies that looks great until it hits a point at which it has to start telling its story, one which never quite matches the almost literally absorbing location. <br /> <br />\\"Dark City\\" is as much a place as a moment frozen in time.  The occupants of the gritty metropolis go about their busy lives, not realizing that it's always night.  Daytime memories are invented and inserted by the city's true masters - an army of deathly gray old men, malevolent \\"Strangers\\" with the power to bend the very structure of the city to their will, and traffic in the memories of its oblivious residents.  The Strangers have a plan - one that requires that they understand us and how we're shaped by our whacked out memories.  Every night at midnight, The Strangers put the entire city to sleep and activate a huge, thought-controlled machine which re-makes the city.  Dowdy waitresses become sultry cabaret singers; blue collar families become uppercrust society clans; the innocent become the hunted guilty.  The last of these is Rufus Sewell, implicated (within the continuity of the city's human population) a murderer.  But Sewell proves uncannily immune to the Strangers and their machines.  Sewell's character receives unlikely help from William Hurt, one of the city's detectives, Jennifer Connelly as the sultry object of Sewell's affections, and Kiefer Sutherland as a human in an uneasy league with the Strangers.  The city is the star of the movie, fluid yet consistently beguiling - it terrifies and tantalizes at the same time.   <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the city is so compelling that none of the movie's human stars can match it - and most of the juiciest performances belong to \\"The Strangers\\" and Kiefer Sutherland's mysterious Peter-Lorre-like scientist.  Unable to fashion out a plot in which the city can retain its enigmatic character while Sewell takes on the Strangers, \\"Dark City\\" boils down to a conventional sci-fi thriller with a disappointingly sunny ending that makes you forget its cool and gritty subject.
B000F3AAUW|5.0|Gnarls Barkley<br /><br />1.) This song shows a nice blend of hyper drum programming and gospel style vocals--reminiscent of rapid drum moments from Cee Lo's two solo albums, but not quite reaching the tech grandeur of Bombs over Baghdad.<br /><br />2.) This song, as my friend Big E would say, is a complete monster of a single reaching its peak and walking away in just three gloriously unflawed minutes.<br /><br />3.) This song is immediately gorgeous, perfectly rolling off the end of Crazy with all the depth of the darkest moments of Demon Days, but with Cee-Lo's solid-gold crooning blanketing the track like fancy linens. Although this track possesses some amazing atmospheric wind sounds, it refuses to linger as it adopts the same painfully short song length as the last two. At this point the album is moving along so quickly that I have to stop it to finish typing. Each of these gems, thus far, could be set to repeat for at least 15 minutes a piece without me getting tired of them. This song could best be described as shimmery with a rich aftertaste (laughing at myself, though it's SO true).<br /><br />4.) Now we see a big mood shift to this amazing Violent Femmes cover (actually written by Willie Dixon, I think). This song demonstrates a playful side just as successfully as the seemingly more sentimental songs that proceed it. Already in less than 15 minutes this duo has shown a range that completely pulverizes anything similar that might have come before it. Attempting to meld the interests of indie music with those of neo-soul, or possibly even R&B, is no small task indeed and yet they make it feel entirely effortless. Furthermore this specific song seems to put Cee-Lo's whole catalogue to bed. He sounds better than he has ever sounded in his entire career. The mood of this song bathes the listener in a comforting sense of calm sentiment. This is the point when Cee-Lo finally joins the likes of Curtis Mayfield and Stevie Wonder. Congradulations C, my man, you have officially arrived!<br /><br />5.) OK, here comes more playfulness and humor like \\"Daddy's Gone\\" provided earlier. Some talk of monsters and vampires, thematically reminiscent of \\"Dracula's Wedding\\" from The Love Below, except here Dangermouse creates a uniquely subdued sound environment filled with muted organ notes and distant muted drums in a minimal pattern. The song wraps up with a line from Cee-Lo saying something about getting head, which solidifies the humor of the track without distracting or stopping for the sake of telling a joke.<br /><br />6.) Alright Dangermouse, flipping it again hunh? On this one we hear a twinkling chime-like melodic part reminiscent of a cross between 50's elevator music and something you might expect from the Neptunes. Both nostalgic and somewhat mainstream feeling at the same time, but once again keeping things painfully short. Without exaggeration, every one of these songs could play at least twice as long without becoming even slightly overplayed. Cee-lo's voice here shows more of his talking-rap approach with only very slight hints of melody in his voice.<br /><br />7.) This song begins with Cee-Lo in a mock-capella feel. Dangermouse teases by dropping a distorted drum part and then muting it back repeatedly, as a Spanish guitar minds it's own business underneath the mildly rampant drum overlay. These drums play out in uneven chunks pausing repeatedly again-and-again. Cee-Lo's singing approach here is unique. He has done something similar to this before, but here is feels absolutely brand new. Dangermouse continues to experiment as the track advances, letting the drums flip and turn as Cee-Lo pauses from singing. DM is also utilizing an interesting phased synth part here and there, and the song ends with many interesting little sound effects creating a confident yet experimental tone.<br /><br />8.) This is a mode many die hard Cee-Lo fans will not walk away happy without hearing: fast drums and a rapid rap-sing approach. However, they continue to reinvent each other by lacing the track with layers of pitch shifted vocals in the background coming in and out in high and low pitches. Yeah, this song has a fresh almost Asian mood to it's quick clicks and flute tones that seem to freshen up the listening experience again.<br /><br />9.) The sentiment returns with gorgeous back up singing, only to be interrupted periodically by a P-Funk-esque voice paired with the playful programming which has reared its head periodically throughout the album (some kind of 50's film noire sample involved). Well matched by Cee-Lo's best effort to be cute and adorable for ladies, delivering lines like: \\"It's deep you could be so shallow,\\" which I must admit I grinned at too. Here we see some more of their mutual love for the organ, but also a moment where the dynamic and passion of the album suffers very slightly for the sake of trying something different through sudden periodic mood shifts.<br /><br />10.)  I have no clue how to describe this. It has echoing disco-ish flutes and starts with a truly new vocal style from Cee-Lo: one in which he sing very soft in a very low Berry White kind of voice. Towards the end of the song we can just make out the frumpy little synth that has been bumping along underneath the whole time-another element reminding me of George Clinton & co.<br /><br />11.) If the album ended now I would ball my eyes out, and alas not only does it not end, but the reinvention continues with an odd necrophilia themed lyric layed over a lackadaisical piano and the shuffling stomp of more distorted drums, this time paired with an uncommon yet natural sounding vocal distortion. The vocal style is more of Cee-Lo's spoken-word-ish approach and not so much really fully singing or rapping, but just talking. Also an interesting touch is the jazz guitar solo morphing with organ-like fringes. The noodling piano is so peculiar with this morbid theme and the jazzyness of it all wrapped around an irrie tone and these distorted textures. This track is quite unique, but a welcome addition.<br /><br />12.) Here comes that great singing again, without distortion, but with a drum presence very similar to the previous song, though even more glitchy and sudden. Oops, I spoke too soon-Dangermouse drops some crazy fast woodblock that sounds equally Florida/booty and Outkast/tech. Cee-Lo is creating a vibe like something huge is coming crashing down, in terms of the emotion in his voice. There is something hilarious about the booty beat mixed with a serious vocal attitude.<br /><br />13.) Here we lighten up into a softer electric-jazz with that odd guitar sound that they have fallen into three or so times on this album so far. This is somewhat sentimental, but with cleaner drums and a much more casual tone like perhaps he's thinking about a woman while he's brushing his teeth or getting dressed quickly. It is laid back in the melody but upbeat in the drums. I really have this overwhelming feeling like this is a driving song because it feels rushed but introspective. Quite a peculiar place to end. Then you hear a film projector flapping, which is matched by the film projector sond in the intro.<br /><br />Clocking in at just 37 minutes, I doubt anyone can resist the urge to push the play button again once the CD ends (but I am admittedly a wierd guy). This album is infectious on a level only rivaled by the greatest soul albums ever released. This is the Super Fly or Inner Visions of our time, and you should make no mistakes about that. I can't wait for someone to tell me that they don't like this, so I can look at them like they are a damn fool who lost their ever loving mind!!!! You could probably play this for your mom (except the necrophelia song--that's a bit much) and yet it is the most cutting edge work to come out in at least the last five years. I am ecstatic about my purchase to say the absolute least. I can't believe this is on an indie label that I have never heardof. I bet all the major label execs are foaming at the mouth to take a big bite out of this cash cow (or maybe not--who knows). At any rate, with no guest appearances at all, Dangermouse and Cee-lo certainly have quite an achievement on your hands (insert standing ovation here). I would not hesitate for a moment to say that this is easily album of the year material-no question at all.quite unique, but a welcome addition. <br />12.)

B00006V9A0|1.0|In the past 50 years Rock N' Roll has had many great artists. Nirvana is of the top of those many who have influenced and revolutionized the genre of music. With their alternative sound mixed with distortion and powerful musicianship made them a force to be reckon with. Kurt Cobain is one of the most influential and correct personalitys in all of rock. After his death instead of bassist Chris Novoselic and drummer David Grohl getting publishing rights Courty Love won them off a technicality and the milking for cash began. How is this amazing band's compliation read on and find out. <br /> <br /> <br />I shall review based off of what made it and what didn't. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Bleach 1989: <br />Representations: \\"About a Girl\\" <br />What?! only one song? it isn't surprising since \\"About a Girl\\" is the most popular song from this album but wheres \\"Blew\\" & \\"School\\" two other classic tracks? The omission of these two is unforgivable. I would have also liked to see \\"Floyd the Barber\\" & \\"Downer\\". <br /> <br />Nevermind 1991: <br />Representations: \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\", \\"In Bloom\\", \\"Come As You Are\\", \\"Lithium\\" <br />It isn't too suprising to find these in any compliation since they are the four hit singles from this classic album. Where the hell is \\"Polly?! & \\"Something in the Way\\" these two ballads are classics and it is unforgivable that they were excluded. Also wheres \\"Drain You\\" that song gets radio play all the time. <br /> <br />Incesticide 1992: <br />Representations: \\"Sliver\\", \\"Been a Son\\" <br />The odds and sods collection has plently more hits songs than just these two. Sure i love these two but where is \\"Aneurysm\\"?! <br />Why wouldn't they put it on it's arguibly their best song. I also would have loved to see \\"Dive\\", \\"Stain\\", and maybe \\"Aero Zeppelin\\". <br /> <br />In Utero 1993: <br />Representations: \\"Heart-Shaped Box\\", \\"Rape Me\\", \\"Dumb\\", \\"Pennyroyal Tea\\",  <br />\\"All Apologies (Live)\\" <br />Decent representation of the bands second album however why use the Unplugged version of the classic \\"All Apologies\\"? I like it live but the studio version is the suprior. I would have also liked to see \\"Serve the Servents\\" and \\"Milk It\\". <br /> <br />Unplugged in New York 1994: <br />Representations: \\"The Man Who Sold the World\\", \\"All Apologies\\" <br />I don't see why they bothered putting these on here in my mind this album has to be heard all together not apart on a compilation. <br /> <br />Overall: <br />If your just buying this for the song \\"You Know, Your Right\\" your wasting your money just download it instead. It isn't a good compilation to many Omissions if you are new and want an introduction i suggest buying their album Nevermind.  <br /> <br /> <br />
B000EHRVP6|5.0|Okay, so the sex-and-slice genre has been overworked. But some of the classics still stick out. Like Halloween, Friday the 13th and Scream (All the first in those series at least). So what makes this one stand out? <br />It's the sum of the parts (no pun intended). <br />Tarantino creates a slow developing sense of trouble and paranoia. It builds from earlier in the film than is suspected and continues til the climax. <br />The plot has been gone over here in other reviews so I won't go into detail there. However, Tarantino has brought a polished product to the genre.  <br />What really sets this apart is that there is no supernatural elements and no psychotics weilding a knife. The 'Elite Hunting Club' is something that everyday people who can afford to buy their services belong to, just like belonging to a country club. <br />The acting, sets, lighting and music all come together with a slick, fast moving story line that is at once believable. <br />What is most frightening about this movie is that it could really be happening! <br />Definitely not for the squemish! Typical buckets of blood splash across the screen. But, if you're up for a true roller coaster ride and being riveted to the screen and gripping your chair... I highly recommend this thriller. It is sure to become a classic!
B000031WBV|5.0|I do not understand how people can not just love this CD set. I found the sound quality as good as any of the best Deutche Grammophon recordings I own.  Rubinstein's interpretation of Chopin is, to my ear and musical sensibilities, just perfect.  He is very nuanced in his every note without subjecting you to an over stylized interpretation.  His performance is consistent, clear and overall the music makes sense, from the beginning to the end of each piece, his stylistic interpretations \\"fit\\" with each other.  The \\"story\\" of each nocturne flows easily and effortlessly.  I feel that Rubinstein's interpretation of these pieces presents them with the greatest focus on the music and not the musician, that I have ever heard.  If you are a Chopin fan, or if you are totally new to classical music, this CD set is the one for you.  If you wanted to have a classical music collection of only one \\"album\\", this one would be it!

B000B8QG4A|5.0|Don't deny any child this wonderful Disney classic. Those crafty Siamese cats have stuck with me since first seeing this movie, maybe 46 years ago? And how Lady got in trouble over that evil old rat really steamed me! I'm dating myself. But on a happier note, Lady and Tramp are so right for each other. I've always remembered that first kiss at the end of the spaghetti. \\"Tonight Is The Night.\\" So romantic. And for sheer humor, the Dogpound scene will tickle the funnybone; enhanced by the talents of Peggy Lee singing \\"He's A Tramp.\\" One of the most memorable Disney films of my childhood. Of course I may be a little biased, since we both came on the scene in 1955. Oops! I'm really dating myself now!
B000EMGAOY|4.0|This Double-Disc Set is plagued by a large variance in quality that has surfaced on past albums (read: \\"I Like Dirt\\" from Californication).  While there are certainly some classic tracks (Dani California, Stadium Arcadium, and Torture Me) and some good ones (Especially in Michigan, C'mon Girl, Wet Sand, She Looks to Me, We Believe, Turn it Again), there is too much bland medium tempo pop filler and too many half-hearted funk jams for this album to be a true classic. <br /> <br />That being said, the filler tracks, while not being transcendant pieces of songwriting, all have their enjoyable moments, most coming from the fact that Flea, Chad Smith, and (especially) John Frusciante (possibly the tightest rhythm section in rock) are just so goshdarned good at their instruments.  Their respective creative genius often causes one to overlook the limp songwriting of a large part of the album, and reminding the listeners during stretches of filler (such as the beginning of disc 2) why we cared in the first place.   <br /> <br />In conclusion, The Chili Peppers are still unable to write consistently great songs, however I would recommend this album if only for the privelege of listening to take in three instrumental virtuosos at their finest.
0805211063|4.0|\\"The Castle,\\" though still an unfinished novel at his death, is Kafka's lengthiest and most well-developed novel.  The crux of the storyline is a land surveyor, only referred to as \\"K.\\", and his gloriously futile efforts to gain knowledge of what exactly he is to be doing in the village.  For, the village and everyone in it belongs to the Castle, an aged and unimpressive conglomeration of buildings and fortifications on a hill overlooking the village below.  Yet, the Castle is not only a place, but a \\"state of mind\\", a state where incessant but enigmatic regulations and procedures saddle the village and its inhabitants with an insurmountable mountain of files, papers, and utter absurdity.  For nothing can be accomplished without navigating the tangled and unfathomable labyrinth of rules and regulations of the Castle.  Yet, its officials are inaccessible.  Indeed, even the shortest contact with the lowliest of officials is almost unheard of, and even if this can be accomplished, nothing ever comes out of it.<br /><br />The Castle enforces its power and influence over all of the village's inhabitants.  Even a threat of action against a citizen is enough to persuade the entire community to ostracize its own.  One can waste years of an otherwise productive life to try to prove false an allegation, yet because there was no formal report or deposition taken, there can be no action taken to rectify the situation.  Yet, because the situation cannot be rectified, the victim remains in an incessant state of limbo, while the very essence of life is slowly drained out.  Indeed, the indefatigable torment of the Castle and its regulations render an entire population impotent and at the mercy of its myriad of officials.<br /><br />Anyone who has read \\"The Trial,\\" may find some common themes.  In fact, \\"The Castle\\" is in many ways similar to \\"The Trial.\\"  Both novels have the same recurring circular logic and logical fallacies that comprise their legal systems.  Both engage in influence peddling with little effect.  Both have the same protagonist - \\"K\\" - who unexpectedly enters a parallel world of which he knows nothing and can gain little knowledge.  However, \\"The Castle\\" is more developed and less ominous and foreboding than \\"The Trial.\\"  Of course, there is no conclusion or climax in \\"The Castle\\", as \\"K.\\" is left in perpetual limbo.  Indeed, in the new Shocken translation, the book ends in mid-sentence, as if the pen had floated off the paper and disappeared.<br /><br />This novel isn't for everyone.  For first-time Kafka readers, I would recommend \\"The Trial\\" over \\"The Castle,\\" as it is more poignant and definitive in its conclusion.  Perhaps that this book is left unfinished will disturb some readers.  Honestly, though, it is fitting that this novel ends in mid-sentence, as it seems as if there will never be a conclusion to \\"K's\\" plight.  Also, this novel lacks punctuation and most sentences are rambling on without periods and paragraphs, so reading it can become tedious at times.<br /><br />However, for Kafka fans, this book will be a must-read, as there are few ...
B00005JKHP|4.0|Of all the Trek films, this one was the closest to (and felt the most like) the original series. It's still nostalgic to see the reunion of Kirk, Bones, Scotty and Spock (plus the rest) as they ready for this new adventure. There are times you feel like you're watching the old show again and to be honest, though I LOVE Trek 2, I never got that feeling again from the other films. They always felt like movies while this one felt like a longer episode and I like that.<br /><br />David Fein did a great job putting this Director's Edition together. The collection of deleted/trimmed scenes from both the 79 theatrical version and the 83 TV version make this DVD a must for completists.<br /><br />Pure Sci-Fi at its best.
B000FGGE68|4.0|I can't understand how people can say the Resident Evil movies are \\"edgy and cool,\\" but this gets trashed.  It was a good action flick.  Aeon Flux sucked.  Catwoman sucked.  At least here you see the heroine kick ass, in a tight costume, with hoards of weapons, for MOST of the movie.  And, get this, she actually kills people in this movie--doesn't just knock them unconscious in deference to our violence loving society.  Hopefully the extended cut will offer even more.  What more do you want?
B00005JOFQ|5.0|After buying the DVD for this motion picture, I only wish that I'd caught it in theaters. It was that good.
B000FIMG68|5.0|I eagerly awaited the second season of \\"Lost\\" last fall and I am eagerly awaiting the second season to be released on DVD. After reading the mostly favorable reviews (the one star review has me wondering if we saw the same show), I'm of the opinion that the believed \\"slump\\" is due to viewers thinking the characters and story lines would fall in place with our own logical conclusions. If we have learned anything about this show, it's that there are no guarantees. <br /> <br />For example, I used to think Sawyer was deep down a good guy behind a bad guy exterior. My opinion changed with the tree frog incident as well as the scheme for the guns. Same goes for Charlie with his \\"visions\\" and crazy behavior. Also, who'd have ever thought that innocent and demure Sun might possibly have a checkered past or that Ana Lucia actually has a heart?  <br /> <br />All my initial impressions of the characters and plot were completely turned around and left me with a feeling of uncertainty. There may have been a sense of betrayal felt by the many fans of this show as a result. At times that uncertainty was hard to swallow, but that uncertainty is what makes \\"Lost\\" such great television and what keeps me glued to me T.V. every Wednesday night. <br /> <br />We must all remember that everything that has transpired so far is for a reason (that's what we're meant to believe, anyway). I will gladly watch this DVD in anticipation of those reasons coming up in season 3. I'm guessing someday we'll all remember season two as not only well written and brilliantly acted, but as the most inportant.
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|Okay, I'm a huge P&P fan but I am not going to write a long analytical review here...there are plenty of them already.  I'm also not going to compare this movie to the 1995 version.  Comparing a two-hour movie to a six-hour mini-series is \\"apples and oranges.\\"  Here's just a few thoughts that come to mind...  *  The Bennet estate - What is with the shabby look and the    mud/farm animals everywhere?  In the book, the home is not richly decorated but it was certainly a lot more affluent than portrayed.  *  The Bennet girls - Keira Knightley did a very good job portraying Lizzie...not perfect but not bad.  The actress who played Lydia was a little too over-the-top and was excessively annoying.  Rosamund Pike was very good as Jane and the other actresses playing Mary and Kitty were very good.    *  Brenda Blethyn was very good as Mrs. Bennet and Donald Sutherland did okay as Mr. Bennet.  He did mumble a little too much.    *  The Meryton Ball - What the heck was up with the hair...the women and the men?  Many of the extras (dancers, etc.) looked disheveled and needed a brush/comb at the very least.    *  Characters missing - Where were the Hursts?    *  Matthew Macfadyen was good as Darcy and the actor playing Bingley did a decent portrayal as well.  *  What was the significance of the pig with the large \\"assets\\"?  *  The scene at Netherfield discussing \\"accomplished women\\" was dull and did not add anything to the character development or the attraction between Darcy and Elizabeth.    *  Makeup - Knightley wore a lot of makeup.  Did you notice she is the only female who wears makeup?  The eye shadow is obvious as well as the blush.  The actress playing Caroline Bingley might have some makeup on but Knightley's was obvious, especially the end scene in the meadow.  Did they not have enough confidence in her \\"natural\\" beauty\\"?  Also, the gown Knightley wore at the Netherfield Ball - a wonder bra or push-up bra might have helped. Also, when the Bennet's left the ball, Lizzie was not in the carriage.  How did she get home?  *  Lizzie visits Pemberly - What's with the nude statues?  A portrait of Darcy alone would have worked nicely.  Also, where did Lizzie's aunt and uncle go?  Lizzie walked back to the village.  Did they leave her behind?  They were all touring the estate together and then the aunt and uncle disappear.    *  Judi Dench's (Lady Catherine) hairstyle - Way over the top!!!  *  Bingley would never have used the word \\"ass\\", especially in the midst of proposing to Jane.  *  Lady Catherine would not have visited the Bennets in the middle of the night.  *  Darcy's open shirt while crossing the meadow....okay, I have to forgive that one....If Colin Firth can jump into a pond and walk around with a wet open see-through shirt...As a female, I loved both scenes.  Please forgive me Jane Austen.  *  Knightley and Macfadyen worked well together and I enjoyed their scenes, especially the declaration of love/proposal scenes and the looks Darcy would throw at Lizzie.  It's the incurable romantic in me.  I also liked the scene at the Meryton Ball where Darcy asks Lizzie the \\"encouraging affection\\" question.  Lizzie's reply is perfect.  At Netherfield when Jane and Lizzie are leaving, Darcy's hand reaction to first touching Lizzie was also a nice touch.    Overall, it was a decent version.  After 193 years, a little creative interpretation of the book is refreshing.  It is a pity that Hollywood won't spend more $ and make a longer version.  Obviously, there was a lot missing from this version due to time constraints.  In two hours, you can't develop the characters and attraction between Darcy and Elizabeth properly.  If they can make King Kong three plus hours, why can't they make a longer version of P&P...I know...because it won't rake in as much money as the action and special effects movies do but it's a shame.        Ooops...this turned out longer than I thought.
B0007P3582|4.0|I really don't know why everybody is dissing on 50 and his new cd. It's like everyone expected him to drop a classic where every song would be a monster hit. HELLO!! This is rap and of course there are gonna be a few skippable songs. That being said, the good songs outnumber the bad ones and they are all excellent tracks that more than make up for the bad ones. A few street hits include \\"In My Hood\\", \\"Ski Mask Way\\", and \\"Position of Power\\". All three are awesome songs that will someday be on a greatest hits album. And you couldn't have a 50 Cent album without the party songs. Three gigantic smashes such as \\"Candy Shop\\", \\"Disco Inferno\\", and \\"Just A Lil' Bit\\". This is an excellent hip-hop album and a real must have if you enjoy rap in any form.
B000002I6T|5.0|With the help of members of the Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane and other L.A. luminaries, David Crosby has created a magical, gorgeous masterpiece. Whether listening to hippie anthems such as \\"Music Is Love\\" and \\"What Are Their Names\\" or the incredibly beautiful harmonies on pieces like \\"Tamalpais High\\", \\"Traction In The Rain\\", \\"Song With No Words\\" and \\"Orleans\\" (which kind of sounds like acapella quartet Anonymous 4 on acid), you can almost smell the weed in the air. Jerry Garcia's lead guitar playing is nothing short of amazing, particularly the heavenly steel guitar on \\"Laughing\\". I bought the original vinyl LP back in the day and practically wore out the grooves so I was overjoyed when it came out on CD. This music still sounds as fresh today as it did back then. It's an essential CD to own.
B00005JOUM|4.0|I found the movie engrossing from start to finish. Clive Owen's performance and his interaction with Denzel Washington were highlights in a well crafted thriller. <br /> <br />Washington's character's personal issues were somewhat of a distraction from the main game as were those of the supporting characters. <br /> <br />Jodie Foster, Willem Dafoe and Christopher Plummer were perfect in their parts and Spike Lee's direction resulted in a well paced tale. <br /> <br />My only reservation with the movie relates to the \\"twist\\". If Denzel's character was so clever and given the amount of interaction, both verbal and physical, that he had with Clive Owen's character, how come he didn't notice that someone was \\"missing\\" at the end of the siege?
B00000K31Q|4.0|This movie is without a doubt one of those movies that seems to \\"stake it's claim\\" sort of to speak within many peoples minds, including mine.  <br /> <br />I'm 23 years of age as I type this. I will be 24 years old in the next few weeks, and I finally seen this movie for the first time this past week, and I have to tell you, I'm sorry I didn't see it sooner. Especially when the movie was first released in 1999, when I would have been 17, and could have related all the more to the people in this movie.  <br /> <br />This movie, an adaptation of \\"taming the shrew\\", and is set in modern day times at a school in Washington state if I'm not mistaken. The cast really brings the characters of this movie to life, and the situations the characters find themselves in are very typical of those the teen-ager in high school finds themselves in.  <br /> <br />This movie has the teen romance story, which is typical of most movies, but involves a few more twists than the average plot. The plot also involves difference characters with different views and standpoints on life in High school, but they all come together to make the plot of the movie work in a fashion that is very likeable, I would imagine for anyone of any age. It really brings to life the teen-ager I think exists within us all.  <br /> <br />This is one of those movies you will enjoy watching over and over again, especially for certain scense, such as when Patrick (Heath Ledger) performs his musical to gain favor in the sight of Kat (Julia Stiles). Or the part of the movie where Kat, enraged at Joey(another guy in the movie) for pulling in behind her, and blocking her way, backs her car purposely into his Z28 Camaro.....OUCH! There is also some odd humor in this movie, such as when Patrick and Cameron are talking, and when Patrick, after being informed by Cameron that Bianca kissed him asks where Bianca kissed Cameron, Cameron responds by saying \\"In the car\\".....lol.  <br /> <br />I don't want to say anymore, as I don't want to give all the scenes away. I will simply say if you've ever seen any teen-movie that you liked, then you will LOVE this movie. <br />
B00006F83Y|5.0|Take two grunge legends (Dave Ghrol and Mark Lanegan), one Stone Rock legend from Kyuss (Nick Oliveri),and a great vocalist riff constructor (Josh Homme) into one single group, and you already know this is one of the best rock records to date.
B000EMGAOY|3.0|This new released RCHP album is definitively hard to rate. <br /> <br />The album is not bad at all, and many today-played music sound worse. But in addition almost any of the RHCP previous albums would hit you harder - at least it happens to me. <br /> <br />To listen Stadium Arcadim once is not enough to find the pleasure in its music. Even more important, you will require an excellent stereo out loud to really enjoy it. <br /> <br />The last disc of RHCP I bought was \\"Live at Slane Castle DVD\\". This is really a concert DVD. In that DVD I listened the cover of \\"Havana Affair\\" (Hurra for Havana!) and in \\"Greatests Hits\\" I found \\"Fortune Faded\\" and \\"Save the population\\". I was sure their musical momentum was the best. This is why I think this CD must be better. Having in mind the album must be unforgetable, I consider it too be extremely soft and melodic.  <br /> <br />But... Do you know what I am really missing?. Flea, of course. Where the hell is this master of bass playing?. That strenght you wont find in this album is caused by a continuous Flea's absence. <br /> <br />Finally, I bought this album, and I would buy it again if necessary. I seriously recommend you to play the following tracklist in your stereo at max volume and thinking on nothing but music (it may be useful program your player), if you really enjoy chili peppers, you will find there the \\"peppers thing\\" doing so: <br /> <br />1. Dani California <br />2. Snow <br />3. 21st Century <br />4. Especially in Michigan <br />5. She looks to me <br />6. Storm in a teacup <br />7. Strip my mind <br />8. So much I <br />9. Fortune Faded (if you have \\"greatest hits\\" at hand) <br />10. Turn it again <br />11. Stadium Arcadium <br />12. Save the population (if you have \\"greatest hits\\" at hand) <br />13.

B000F0UV0E|3.0|Emmylou, as the saying goes, could sing the phonebook, your laundry list, bus schedule, etc., and it would sound like a zillion damn bucks. So, I'm completely down with anything she participates in. Not so much Mr. Knopfler. Used to like the Dire Straits back in the day, but as I followed MK's solo career, it seemed increasingly bland and MOR to me...which zeroes in on the problem here. What we have here is a little too much Knopfler and a little too little Emmylou. MK wrote all but 3 of the songs (I believe) and his sound, his guitar playing is all over the place...so what you end up with is more like a Knopfler solo record with some added duet vocals. Not to dismiss it though: it's extremely catchy and pleasant, and these are some of the best, perkiest melodies MK has come up with in a while.
B00008EY9G|4.0|Even though the plot device of characters with split personalities or multiple personalities has been done before, Identity is at least clever with it. This is a really good movie.  <br /> <br />The movie goes like this: 11 people end up at a motel due to a bad rainstorm and flooding. Once there, the people start getting knocked off one by one. Think of Agatha Christie's And Then There Were None meets Psycho. <br /> <br />There's the former cop turned limo driver played by John Cusack, driving a self-centered movie star played by Rebecca DeMornay. <br /> <br />The former prostitute trying to get to Florida to grow an orange grove played well by Amanda Peet. <br /> <br />The young, newly married couple who are far from happy, played by Clea Duvall and William Lee Scott. <br /> <br />A convict and the deputy escorting him to another prison. Played by Jake Busey and Ray Liotta respectively. <br /> <br />The misogynistic hotel manager who has a couple of secrets.-John Hawkes <br /> <br />An older married couple and their young son.-John C. McGinley, Leila Kenzle, Brett Loehr <br /> <br />The events happening at the motel are cut in every once in a while by a late-night meeting going on between a psychiatrist and a judge and several other people. The psychiatrist's patient, Pruitt Taylor Vince, looks like Uncle Fester from The Addams Family and is about to be executed shortly after. The shrink is trying to convince the judge that his patient need not be executed. For most of the time watching the film, you don't understand what the people at the motel have to do with this other subplot. Some might be confused as to what the heck is going on, but the tie-in is pretty clever. <br /> <br />Some spoilers below. <br /> <br /> <br />The people at the motel are the 11 different personalities of the Uncle Fester dude that he developed because of years of abuse and neglect. One of these personalities is responsible for a murder rampage the guy went on, which is why he is on deathrow. The shrink is trying to convince people that he can get one of the personalities to kill the evil personality so Uncle Fester won't do anything else evil. <br /> <br />The 11 are there to do battle but don't know it. The doctor eventually taps John Cusack's former cop limo driver, who signifies the strong, good but flawed personality, and tells him what he has to do. <br /> <br />Problem is, more than one personality is bad, and it becomes a red herring fest to figure out who is responsible for the murders. <br /> <br />It is oodles and noodles better than Twisted and Taking Lives and Hide and Seek and Secret Window and plenty of other thrillers that have come out in the past 5 or so years. But I guess this still isn't saying much is it? <br /> <br />Anyway... <br /> <br />Very nice way to spend a late night. <br />
B000EULJLU|5.0|The album opens with the first single, Vicarious, which has already won a special place in my heart as a perfect opening track. It's classic Tool, as anyone who has heard it on the radio can attest to. Pounding rhythms and a fantastic lyrical attack on the current media-centric world we live in. Following that we have Jambi, a fast paced rocker that reminds me of Ticks & Leeches or Eulogy. It is, in my opinion, the weakest song on the album (if such a thing can be said of a good song), though its last two minutes are magic. It will make the headbangers happy. Wings For Marie (Pt. 1) is next, a Parabol-like segue into the albums title track 10,000 Days (Wings Pt. 2). For fans who have complained that Tool is pushing no new ground on this record, I have to ask if they've just skipped right over this track. Easily the most epic and haunting song the band has ever produced, the sound of a thunderstorm intersects with Danny Carey's tribal drumming and Justin Chancellor's steady bass line. Maynard's voice whispers and weaves its way around the lyrics as Adam produces some seriously melodic volume swells with his guitar. The vocals are doubled, sometimes tripled, shot into low baritone even, for some passages, and the whole song sounds like an ancient prayer ritual, and as Maynard sings \\"Fetch me the spirit, the son and the father. Tell them the pillar of faith has ascended. It's time now, my time now, give me my wings.\\" you realize it just may be. 10,000 Days may be the highlight of the album, and it's easily the highlight of the first half. Following on the heels of the epic title track, The Pot is an angry song that hearkens back to the musical style of Undertow and Opiate, with a popping bass groove and lyrics that remind me of Hooker with a [...]. The first half comes to a close with Lipan Conjuring, a short passage of vocals that is reminiscent of Mantra from the Lateralus album.<br /><br />The second half of the album opens with another instrumental, Lost Keys (Blame Hoffmann), a segue into Rosetta Stoned, a rocking rollick though an LSD trip. With lyrics both funny and philosophical, it's the albums Third Eye, and is the only track, other than the title track, to clock in at over ten minutes. Intension follows in a style that reminds me of the Lateralus track Disposition and A Perfect Circle's The Package. A few minutes into the song and out comes the tabla (no doubt played by the great Aloke Dutta). The shifting guitar lines and rhythm section provide a backdrop for Maynard's mostly whispered lyrics, the song closely resembles the live version of Push-It heard on the Salival box set. It is a high point on the album, as is the next track. Right In Two may be my personal favorite song (besides 10,000 Days itself). A nine minute track that has the feel of Forty-Six & Two mixing with the new sound Tool has created on this album, with lyrics that may be the greatest ever written on the subject of human and spiritual evolution, it needs to be heard to have any justice done to it. I'm sure it will be killer live. The final track on the album is yet one more instrumental. Viginti Tres is a very strange song that sounds like the bastard child of Faaip de Oaid and (-)ions. To be honest, listening to it on my headphones tonight at work, I almost walked into a wall when the only voice in the song comes out of the murk. I thought it was the voice of Satan himself. Quite frankly, it may be.<br /><br />I hope that does the album some justice. Anyone who has heard 10,000 Days and complains that Tool is pushing no new ground are, I am convinced, the same people who would have criticized the band for not sounding like itself had they made a record in the completely opposite direction. Some people can never be happy. For the rest of us, the five year wait since Lateralus was well worth it.nn), a segue into Rosetta Stoned, a rocking rollick though an LSD trip.

B000F48CD8|5.0|I had been looking forward to this album ever since I heard of its creation, being a huge White Stripes fan.  At first I thought that Jack White's teaming with Brendan Benson would detract from White and that the album would consist of half White tracks and half Benson, and therefore be only half good.  As it turns out though, Benson is very good, and his pop tendencies mix perfectly with the eccentric rocker persona of White (which reminds me of Lennon and McCartney, though obviously not at their level as no one is), and they have crafted some fantastic and wildly original songs.  All songs are great, and the more I listen to it the more I'm convinced it is one of the best albums I have ever heard by any band.  I'm not quite ready to say The Raconteurs are better than the White Stripes because the Stripes have a lot of material to choose from and at 10 songs, Broken Boy Soldiers is a quick listen.  I do wish it were longer and I hope this band isn't just a one album fling because it would be a shame not to continue it.  Overall, Broken Boy Soldiers sounds like a mix of current alternative rock, classic 60s rock, and something never heard before.  If this sounds weird, it is, but it is awesome.
B000EULJLU|4.0|With its flowing, profound, addictively heavy, but at some points obsessive tracks, 10,000 Days has its ups and downs.  First off, `Jambi' is one of the best Tool songs I`ve heard since their 1993 debut; guitar riff utterly astounding, Keenan's vocals simply amazing.  The single `Vicarious' also stands out as another great, although not quite as strong.  Obviously, this album has a general theme-really, really long songs.  Very much like its predecessor, Lateralus, the tracks on 10,000 Days rarely stop short of ten minutes.  This is both masterful and obsessive:  Masterful in the fact that the musical quality of `Wings for Marie' and its sister title track rivals that of `Forty-Six and Two' and `Third Eye' off Anemia.  Obsesive, however, because I simply had heard enough at the half-way point of most of the songs and was ready to move on to the next track before anyone of them was actually over.  I hate to admit it but I was bored near the end of the album.  It's not that `Rosetta Stoned' and `Right in Two' are bad tracks; had they been placed at the beginning of the album, I'd listen to them as much as `Vicarious.' It's just that after 1:15 of the same stuff I got boarded and, in the end, realized that it just gets a little out of hand.  Not to take anything away from sheer quality of the music, though.  It's easy to see that the band put forth a lot of effort into 10,000 Days.  Definitely worth a listen but not necessarily worth EVERY minute like most will say upon first review.
B0007OCG4W|2.0|Good Cast, Good Director, Good Story but what happened? This is a bad movie. Julia Roberts is not believable in her role, Jude Law is irritating, Clive Owen is miscast and Natalie Portman is just wonderful! The story of two couples whose lives are intertwined with a complex sexual infatuation with each other. The story lacks the tension and the chemistry is non-existant (especially between Julia R. and Clive O.) I gave it one star for Natalie Portman, who gave an excellent performance and the other for the title song (Blower's Daughter by Damien Rice).This movie bored me to tears..
B000035Z1Z|5.0|Imagine if Henry James were a Hollywood screenwriter: Meg Ryan as American (soon to be Canadian) naif - basically a modern Daisy Miller, chasing her fiance Timothy Hutton across Europe, only to be seduced by the French rogue, Kevin Kline.  But because it is Hollywood, the studio makes him screen test the thing, and the focus groups demand he collaborate with a ghost-writer, re- write the script as a comedy, turn the doom of the story on the fiance, while giving the rogue a heart of gold and the movie a happy ending.<br /><br />Or something like that.<br /><br />Which is only to say that this is a great movie.  Perpetually entertaining.<br /><br />The cast is terrific. Meg is as always (can you guess? That's right) adorable.  Kevin is a pretty convincing Frenchman- though my French is not perfect, I think his acting in that language does all Americans proud.  Tres bien fait, Kev.  Timothy Hutton - just why is it that we don't see more of him, anyway?  And Jean Reno is simply le grand maitre ninja fran'cais.<br /><br />Now, this is a Hollywood fabrication, or rather production.  So unsurprisingly the story is somewhat predictable and crammed with caricatures.  But no matter.  It is light, often funny, and just plain enjoyable.  And I highly recommend it.
B0000C8AVE|5.0|It never ceases to amaze me what can be done with one man with a guitar in his arms, a harmonica in his mouth, and a song in his heart. Although this is a simple arrangement, this album manages to be one of the thought-provoking and insightful recordings i have ever heard from the sixties. Age the young age of twenty one, Bob Dylan had already crafted what would be one of the definative songs of the civil rights movement, \\"Blowin in the Wind.\\" However, as he strums the final chord of his grand, yet modest opener, the album has only begun. Another lesser known gem, \\"Girl From the North Country\\" continue to inspire  and grip the listener, even if it is a song about the simple admiration of a beautiful girl. Masters of War is a huge middle finger to all those who, \\"never do nothin, but build to destroy\\". A later track \\"Bob Dylan Blues\\" is a fun song sporting amusing and oddly profound lyrics. When the next song comes out your speakers, however the fun is over, and What comes next is a chilling, and frighfully ominous stream-of-conscious style of storytelling about the horror of a possible nuclear attack. \\"I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken... I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children.\\" This song, A Hard-Rains' a Gonna Fall\\" is my favorite on the cd and always gives me goosebumps whenever i hear it. The comfortable and nostalgic \\"Don't Think Twice, it's alright\\" can win over any newcomer to Bob Dylan. \\"Talkin World War III Blues\\" and \\"I shall be free\\" are good examples of Bob Dylan's unique and intelligible use of humor. All in all if you are interested in Bob Dylan, this is a good place to start, and needless to say, is essential for any Bob Dylan and Folk Fan.
0767020308|5.0|Superior casting, direction, and production values have produced a superior film that stays true to Austen's classic novel without the excessive cloying \\"cutesyfying\\" of Gwenyth Paltrow's depiction of the title role.   <br /> <br />I am genuinely stunned that there are reviewers here who expressed preference for the Paltrow film (which is more a parody of \\"Clueless\\" than anything else.  Yes, I understand \\"Clueless\\" is a modern retelling of \\"Emma\\" but it is still different in several pertinent ways.)  Beckinsale's portrayal is EXACTLY how I would expect Emma Woodhouse to look and behave if she were a living breathing person.   <br /> <br />Thank A & E for giving us a \\"real\\" Emma.
B000002UJQ|5.0|From the first Claustrophobic Guitar riff to the closing triangle strike, this album inspires, amazes, invents, tears apart, and reinvents(Not sure what order). Although this album was released almost a decade ago, people are still buying it, still listening to it and still talking about it. Why is this? Why has it topped Pitchfork media's and Spin Magazine's list of best albums of the 90s? Because after almost a decade since its release there is simply nothing else like it. After all this time, it still sounds new futuristic and on the fringe. This album grows more and more relavent with each new invention and technilogical breakthrough. Under the simplest summarization. Ok Computer is about the distrust and loss of identity with new-coming technology. The epitome of this is \\"Fitter, Happier.\\" <br />\\"Let Down\\" is my favorite track, but it could have just as easily have been \\"Paranoid Android,\\" \\"Subterranean Homesick Alien\\" or any other track on this perfect, mind-blowing album. I recommend it to all who do not have it, and you should be ashamed of yourselves.
1899836357|3.0|I bought this book after reading the rave reviews.  Maybe I was expecting too much but I found the book overly academic, abstruse, rarefied, laden with jargon and poorly written.  It begins with a review of some devleopmental psychology (Piaget, Gestalt theory, etc.).  I had not read anything this dry and boring since my college intro psych course.  The authors present a model of hypnotic language that appears to be their personal theory with little reference to any evidence.  The case examples are somewhat more interesting but the proposed dialogue is so academic that it's hard to imagine anyone in the real world talking like that.  I suppose this book would appeal to overyly intellectualized NLP nerd types who get off on playing with jargon somewhere up above cloud 9 and with little grounding in reality.  For us practical, flesh-based, earth folk, this book is a jargonized disappointment.  Can you imagine saying the following to a living, breathing human being:  \\"Just how is it that you know what you think you know...and before that?  You must find some reference to which you pay deference. ... Now you know you must contain the where with all within for performing as desired because you know you are not yet you will, won't you?\\"  Got it?  Then buy the book and you can read a lot more sentences like the ones quoted above.
0553584537|5.0|Desperate circumstances call for desperate measures. This story tells of people finding themselves in extreme, often intolerable circumstances, and the road each travels in search of a solution. This is a fast-paced, exciting read that spans the gamut of human emotions. I highly recommend this page-turner.
B000EGCITG|5.0|I am seriously addicted to this cd. I have always been a fan of Pink, but never of an entire cd of hers. This one I ADORE front, back, sideways and backwards. I can't pick a favorite song, but I have to say that \\"Dear Mr. President\\" is the most moving. And \\"Conversations with my 13 year old self\\" is just the kind of song that I can really relate to.  <br />A few of the songs I can't stop replaying besides the aforementioned: <br />Who Knew <br />Leave Me Alone (I'm Lonely) <br />Long Way TO Happy <br /> <br />U & UR hand is a great song to listen to before heading out with your girls. <br /> <br />seriously just a wonderful album - thank you Alicia!
0142004235|5.0|The main thing that makes Steinbeck great to read is that he's actually wise, he has genuine insights to impart to his readers. In this book, he often \\"tells\\" instead of \\"shows,\\" which is supposed to be bad writing technique, but it works for Steinbeck because what he has to tell is so interesting and thought provoking, and because he tells it so well.  His characters are beautifully and lovingly sculpted, even his \\"monster\\".   <br /> <br />Before I read it, I had reservations. I was worried it would be too long.  This was not a problem, because Steinbeck's writing is so good, and I was sucked in quite early in the book. I've read much shorter books which were much more laborious to read.  <br /> <br />I was also worried it would be too dreary--after all, a \\"modern re-telling of Cain and Abel\\" is clearly going to be tragic.  I had also heard that the book is humorless.  And, it is true, a lot of his other work displays a lightness of touch, a subtle sense of humor, even when dealing with big, harrowing stories.  (After all, there were even passages in the \\"Grapes of Wrath\\" that made me laugh out loud.)  This book mostly lacks that light touch.  What he does still display here is a humane-ness, he seems to me to be non-judgemental in his treatment of most of his characters, even as he shows them being \\"sneaky\\" or \\"mean\\".  And I suppose that may be the thing I liked best about the book, the humane way he treats his characters, while putting them through the choreography of a compelling, moving story. This is not one of those epics about which you say to yourself, \\"Wow, I'm so proud that I was able to slog through that enormous, diffficult thing.\\"  Even though it's not a pretty story, this is a big, easy read, with all the \\"epic\\" characteristics the other reviewers talk about. Good stuff.
B00003CXTG|5.0|One of the best films around to watch. It has all the history from the suprise attack of Pearl Harbor, to the undaunting raid led by Jimmy Doolittle. Once in a while, a movie comes along about factual events. This movie, as my father says, is 95% accurate, not bad for hollywood standards.
0307277674|1.0|I read this book solely because it is a cultural phenomenon, and I believe one should keep abreast of what is happening in one's culture. Recently however, the New York Times amusingly and accurately referred to 'The DaVinci Code' as \\"Dan Brown's best-selling primer on how not to write an English sentence\\". This is not great literature. It is also not an original or particularly interesting story. Anyone who has ever seen the movie 'The Last Temptation of Christ' is familiar with the supposedly 'controversial' idea that Christ was married to Mary Magdalen and they had children. In fact, there wasn't a single idea in this book that I hadn't already encountered elsewhere. I don't understand why people are getting their knickers in a twist over a rather poorly written mystery novel with an unoriginal religion-based plot with thin, stereotypical characters. Anyone's whose faith is in any way compromised by this book is an idiot. And to all those people trying to have it banned or those who are uttering threats because of the release of the movie I have this to say - Christian religious fanatics threatening violence and calling for censorship are no better than any other type of religious fanatic threatening violence and calling for censorship.
B000E41MS6|5.0|when I found out the bbc was making the show again I drove 4 hours to Canada to get the box set becouse it was already released after I watched all 13 episodes I found that it was well worth the 4 hour drive there the two hours getting lost!  coming out,the wait at custims, and the 4 hour drive home also the price I payed was a lot more then amazon. Christopher Eccleston is one of the best actors I have ever seen and gives the doctor a depth beyond comparison Billie Pipers Rose makes me remember when I was a kid and why I whanted to be the doctors  companian.        Fantastic!!!!!
B0007KTBIU|5.0|I love this movie. The song Colors of the Wind speaks to me like none other. Being Native American myself, I can honestly say this movie does all Native American's justice. I think Disney did well with their version of this story. I am glad I bought it and I recommend it to all people of all ages.
B00005JNQS|2.0|**1/2<br /><br />Despite its clean and shiny look, its stellar cast of voices and its expert animation, \\"Robots\\" offers little to interest the adult audience.  Set in a world made up entirely of mechanical creatures, the film tells the tale of a young robot named Rodney Copperbottom who leaves home to find fame and fortune in the Big Bad City.  Once there, he discovers that a major manufacturing company has decided to stop making affordable replacement parts for the robots of the world, instead forcing them to either pay for expensive upgrades or face annihilation in the city's infamous chop shop.  Soon, Rodney and his new assorted pals are taking on the villain and taking a stand for oppressed robots every where.<br /><br />In addition to its rather trite and hackneyed storyline, the screenplay lacks the sharp humor and satirical edge of the \\"Shrek\\" and \\"Toy Story\\" movies, relying instead on a series of uninspired double entendres - and a plethora of flatulence jokes - that seem a trifle inappropriate in a film aimed mainly at young children.  The movie does have a nice Oz-like, art deco look to it, which at least gives the viewer something to watch while the story ever so slowly spins itself out.  The list of well-know actors providing voiceover work here is a long and distinguished one, though, frankly, the only performer I really recognized was Robin Williams.  Too bad they weren't given material worthy of their time or talents.
B00003CX8N|5.0|An engaging and thoughtful story about the power of words and enduring friendship. A beautiful film.
B00008BLB8|5.0|Badartfilms needs to dial-back the valium intake. Most reviewers have this one nailed: \\"Caught in the Act\\" is one of the best live rock albums ever recorded, in spite of the so-so production values of the original. (Haven't actually heard this remix/remaster.) Hyper-energized and full of the all-out attitude that made the era great, this record embodies all that was 60's/70's rock. <br /> <br />\\"We're gonna take a step back and dedicate this song . . . to everybody who's puttin' that funky smell into the air . . . We want you to blow some up this way!\\"
B000002ADT|5.0|I kind of understand where the reviewer below is coming from, because this album is not a jiving New-Orleans style jazz, if that's the main thing you've been exposed to. However, it transcends that form of jazz, which is geared (in my mind) to be danced to. The music of \\"Kind of Blue\\" is totally cerebral, to be listened to again and again, and yet never lose its ability to fascinate. As my friend told me last night, \\"it grooves.\\"  <br /> <br />For anyone who wants an introduction to real jazz, this is the album to start with.
B000F3AAUW|5.0|I can't add too much more to the excellent reviews here. But as a fan of Outkast, Goodie Mob, and other southern rap (e.g., T.I.P.), AND Gorillaz, Tricky, Morcheeba, Phoenix, and other more or less electronicy and knobtwiddly stuff, let me just say, this album is fantastic. It's definitely way more towards the Gorillaz end of the spectrum than the southern rap. And the strange blend of sounds, which to quote Outkast \\"all blends perfectly let the liquor tell it,\\" may not be suitable to be cranked at 10 right off the bat. But it is soooo infectious. You gotta love this album. Hearing it is like what people must have felt like the first time that they dropped ...Endtroducing by DJ Shadow. And if that doesn't sell you.....
B00005YJMX|5.0|the whole movie can be summed up in two words klaus kinski!! his take on the \\"nosferatu\\"(vampire) is one so removed from most vampire movies that it really is strikeing in its tone. our vampire is one who has been one for so long that most,if not all,of the human qualities he had are long gone and he is little more than an animal(like the rats he keeps,and looks very much like). he never lets you take your eyes off him once you meet him!! he looks alone and lost in the castle when we see him and the only time we see any life(pun intended) is when he see's harker's wife's picture and in the last scene he has with her! if you get into it this tale will keep you glued to the set long after it ends! a very good film and the transfer is great.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|Alright so I may be a little different than the average Chili Pepper fan.  I love melody.  My favorite band is The Beatles and to me nothing tops rock guitar with harmonizing and melody.  <br /> <br />While I respected the Chili Peppers in the 80's I never really dug their music.  I was to busy listening to Ozzy, Metallica, Guns N Roses and other heavy metal bands.  However, once alternative broke I really started to expand my musical tastes.  Punk and Alternative were everything to me.  But it still had to have melody.  Smells Like Teen Spirit, The Misfits, Danzig these were the people I loved along with classic rockers like Tom Petty.  When I heard RHCP sing under the bridge I was blown away.  I loved that song and it was so dissimiliar from what the band had done in the past.  I kind of watched the band grow throughout the 90's loving every ballad they did. <br /> <br />I always said that the Chili Peppers should do an album of slow mid tempo ballads and they finally did with By The Way which I think is their best album ever and the first album I could listen to without skipping a single song.  No filler all Killer.  I also was very pleased with the John Frusciante solo album  Shadows Collide with people.  He is one of my favorite guitarists now.  He makes sweet melodic sounds come from the guitar he is truly amazing. <br /> <br />It was with hesitation that I approached Stadium Arcadium because I heard it was a return to their \\"funky roots\\" with some slower vocal pop stuff thrown in.  However, As soon as I popped the CD's in I was awashed in a world of melody and insane Frusciante guitar antics.  At times, he sounds like hendrix and Clapton it is truly amazing.  He truly helps make this band great.  The harmonization and the melodies are so sticky sweet throughout this disc even on the more uptempo funk songs.  I love every song.  I am slightly more partial to the second disc, however; I have not found a song yet that I did not like.  Probably my all time favorite on the album is the 3rd song on side two(the one about marriage).  I never look at song titles I just remember them by the position on the CD.  Every time, I listen to this double deluxe masterpiece I like it better and better.  I cannot think of another double album that I have loved this much except for maybe 2Pac's \\"All Eyes on Me\\"  and of course The Beatles white album.   <br /> <br />I bought the deluxe package which was really cool with all kinds of nifty collectibles thrown in.  As a music collector it was worth it to me.   <br /> <br />I truly reccomend this CD to anyone who loves good melody, classic rock guitar stylings or anyone with a decent taste in rock music
B0006L16N8|5.0|Coldplay took nearly 18 months to finish its third album.They reportedly even threw away nearly 60 songs before getting it down to the final tunes for the album. Such is the pressure of  following up 2002's  A Rush of Blood to the Head, which graduated them from intriguing to \\"important\\" while selling 10 million copies in the process. <br /> <br />\\"Speed of Sound,\\" the first single off  X& Y, reveals the hand they're playing: a piano riff as memorable as the one in \\"Clocks,\\" ringing guitars, martial drums, orchestral pomp and, in the center, Chris Martin's keening vocal, so vulnerable and yet forceful enough to stand out from the mass of sonic detail. But \\"Speed of Sound\\" is just the tip of the iceberg. <br /> <br />As opener \\"Square One\\" enters with a wash of strings and/or string-like keyboards before the thrilling entrance of Champion's pummeling drums and a huge bass line expanding to a mind-blowing climax. Martin's naked piano introduces the following \\"What If,\\" which enlarges at each sectional transition, with strings appearing at the start of verse two and the band erupting at the first chorus. These are massive and graceful perfectly suited to Martin and Buckland's metaphysical ponderings about the unanswerable questions of existence. <br /> <br />The album's sheer size overwhelms its particulars on first listen, but over time a few tracks take on lives of their own: With its clarion electric riff  \\"Talk\\" stands out as an anthem in an album full of them; \\"Low,\\" which gallops along on a relentless bass line, serving up a Cure-like instrumental transition, offers the record's most intoxicating groove; and the concluding \\"Twisted Logic\\" with its  backward-like strings through symphonic forcefulness.  <br /> <br /> X&Y is hardly a step forward but rather a consolidation of Coldplay's strengths, particularly their skill at crafting surging, widescreen epics,and full of earnest, emotional and affecting piano ballads like \\"Fix You\\" and \\"A Message\\" that only get better with time. Some may call it repetitious, but with songs so beautifully crafted, everyone should agree that X&Y equals A. <br /> <br />Bottom line is: Coldplay is a band with the audacity to aspire to greatness and the talent to achieve it and  X&Y  is designed to be the record that elevates Coldplay to the major leagues, where they are at once one of the biggest and most important band in the world.Enough said. <br /> <br /> <br />
B000ENWKN8|1.0|Fell way short of my expectations.  Would not listen to any songs on this CD again.  Love Zombie but this one has nothing special on it fairly bland.  Would not purchase this CD and glad I didnt.  And I'm not bias I'm a fan and haveb been since White Zombie.  This CD just doesnt cut it.
0823003590|5.0|Great for beginner to intermediate. I learned more from this book than any other book on drawing the head. Everything that's important is covered. In that respect it's complete just as the title implies. I read the one bad review here. Totally didn't get what he's saying.
B000E1YVZU|5.0|I've always wanted to see RENT, although I was just a lowly teenager when it first appeared on Broadway, so I didn't give it a second thought. I really just liked to see the commercial. Friends holding arm-in-arm, walking down the street, singing a song with lyrics I could barely make out.<br /><br />Whatever. I saw Rent the movie for the first time 2 days ago. I LOVED it. Although it was supposed to be set in NY, 1989-1990, and battled topics that I have virtually no familiarity with - it's like I could feel everything was happening to the characters. That's when I know I've connected physically with a movie. Granted, I have no non-internet knowledge of RENT, the Broadway Musical, I still hope to see it one day and figure that if it's as good as the film, I'll be blown away. Permanently.<br /><br />I connected with all of the characters and their struggles, although I didn't at first. I still feel that Benny, played by Tate Digg's role in the movie is insignificant, and I couldn't figure out Mark's role/issues in the whole thing. Apparently, this is explained more in depth in the play, and in the extended version of \\"Goodbye Love\\". The film is not a goody-goody comical version of something deep and dark like \\"Chicago\\" was. It presents issues and deals with them in a subtle way. And yes, with a soundtrack and a montage of scenes that are both refreshing AND depressing. One scene that is especially sad is the one at the Life Support group(for those with AIDS) that goes with the song \\"Will I?\\"<br /><br />\\"Will I lose my dignity,<br />Will someone care<br />Will I wake tomorrow,<br />From this nightmare?\\"<br /><br />Haunting.<br /><br />I thought Rosario Dawson did a very good job in the role of Mimi. Her voice isn't exceptionally strong, and listening to \\"Out Tonight\\" (one of my favorite tracks) on my Ipod, I could hear the guitar chords overpowering her voice. Other than that, I felt she did fine. One overall theme of the movie was centered on the recurring lyrics of \\"No Day But Today\\". As 4 out of the 8 main characters have AIDS, it's befitting that they live their life to the fullest.<br /><br />I don't feel complled to comment any further, 'cept to say that you can't please everyone. There are people who like the play, but don't like the film. Then others that like the film, but don't like to play. I'm content in knowing that the best of RENT is out there for everyone in more than one form. So choose what satisfies you. By the way, the soundtracks are hot!cters have AIDS, it's befitting that they live their life to the fullest.

B000DZIGDU|1.0|This plodding film attempts to \\"shock and awe\\" the viewer with its depiction of the U.S. Marines as unstable, anti-social, bloodthirsty thugs, and tries to impugn the United States' actions in Operation Desert Storm as motivated by oil company profit.  <br /> <br />I realize the viewer is supposed to be shocked by the scene in which the soldiers are hooting and hollering with excitement while watching a violent scene from Apocalypse Now, but all I was thinking was how much I'd rather be watching that movie too, instead of this dismal wreck. <br /> <br />For a much better look at the dark, disturbing side of the American military, watch Apocalpyse Now, Full Metal Jacket, or even Three Kings. Don't waste your time here.
B0009P42SC|3.0|ok...i waited forever for this movie to come out what with the budget problems and the massive delay in production and id like to say it was worth the wait...but...it wasnt. it looks great, sounds great, the concept is good and all but, well, it could have been better...and dare i say...longer? the character development was not there, the technology seems to be overshadowed but the drawn out over simplified plot. i tried to watch this movie three time and fell asleep twice. the little girl...scarlet ohara...i mean come on. must have ran out of the money in the creative name budget. i may have to give it another chance in japanese with subtitles because this voice over was almost as painful as princess mononoke. patrick stewart was the only real talent in the entire voice over cast. not enough.  all in all...what had potential to be an awesome movie turns out to be a drawn out over simplified, under explained, extremely high budget animated movie that left me feeling cheated. i dont know what happened with this film but maybe he should have given up at the first sign of problems.
0743454537|5.0|I am not an avid reader however a friend, who is, recommened this book. It was amazing. Jodi Picoult really knows how to tell a story and connect you with the characters. I was not able to put it down. I was so stunned by the last chapter I had to pick it up and read it again. I have recommended this book to all my friends and even some strangers, I surley recommend it to you.
B000002WCJ|5.0|Released only a year apart from its predecessor 'Part 1', 'Keeper Of The Seven Keys Part 2' finds Helloween at the top of their game and in the middle of creating a genre later known as power metal. With the same line-up as 'Part 1' (consisting of Kiske on vocals, Hansen and Weikath on guitar, Grosskopf on bass and Schwichtenberg behind the kit) Helloween continue their concept of good vs. evil, anti-war protests and freedom for all with extremely inspirational lyrics....not to mention well crafted songs.  Kiske displays a powerful and innovative voice. With greater vocal ability and more confidence he flows through each song wonderfully....never holding back. The dual guitar shredding from Hansen and Weikath bring speed, power and melody to its highest point clearly separating themselves from comparisions to shall I say.........Iron Maiden. Grosskopf's bass lines are a bit relaxed yet still mature and experimental. And bringing up the rear is the solid thumping of Schwichtenberg.  The production of the album is a bit better than 'Part 1'. The sound is bigger with a commerical feel to it that 'Part 1' lacked. In ways I enjoy the pop-friendly songs (Dr. Stein, I Want Out) but at the same time I don't. It seemed a bit cheesy at certain points. Especially during the worst (in my opinion) Helloween track from that period. The silly sounding 'Rise And Fall' stands out as the weakest song from both albums. Leading me to believe \\"What were they thinking\\". But the weakest points are few and far between.   With stand-out tracks like 'You Always Walk Alone', 'We Got The Right' and the extremely confident sounding 'Eagle Fly Free', not to mention the deeper, heavier tracks like 'March Of Time', 'Save Us' and the 13+ minute epic 'Keeper Of The Seven Keys' Helloween has made a permanent stamp on the face of metal.  Yet it is still hard to believe this band was falling apart while creating the 'Keeper' albums. Internal fueding and bad record contracts lead to the exit of founderKai Hansen just mere weeks after the release of 'Part 2'. The chemistry was perfect but unstable and couldn't last. Helloween would never again sound this incredible.   The rest of this review is for the 2 disc UK expanded edition which I highly recommend. Having the original is great but this remastered edition clearly rocks. Everything has come to life from the old recording sessions and everything sounds so incredible. Along with that there are extra tracks here for the hardcore fans of the band. 'Savage' a great Kiske-penned track is an upbeat number with great lyrics and an awesome arrangement. Another b-side called ' Livin' Ani't No Crime' is equally satisfying. Then there is 'Don't Run For Cover' a somewhat poppy but also very enjoyable track. Each one of these b-sides have awesome riffs and could have easily been put on either 'Keeper' album. Two remixed versions of 'Dr. Stein' and 'Keeper Of The Seven Keys' taken from the 'Treasure Chest' compliation round off the second disc.  Whether you are new to the band or an old fan such as myself this expanded edition is the way to go. Hands down worth the extra $$$ for the import. Buy it for the sound,for the extra tracks and for the booklet filled with pics and notes about the recording sessions. It's hard to believe these albums are almost 20 years old and they still sound fantastic. And although I'm not a fan of power metal in general I am a proud fan of Helloween.
B0009TRRN0|1.0|this movie is how i discovered \\"the lone wolf and cub\\" series and they did a good job of putting the two movies together and it was very good. <br />   this transfer here looks bad and really for the money buy the whole set of 6 and you'll do yourself much better!
B000EULJLU|5.0|Its been seven years since I started listening to any Rock genre from The Beatles, Led Zeppelin to System Of A Down to Tool. You name a band and I have listened to them. Thats how much I love rock music. Tool is no doubt one of my favorite bands. They have sharp guitar riffs, excellent smooth and loud vocals, lets just say everything is perfect and fitting. <br /> <br />Since their last album Lateralus in 2001, their new album 10000 Days is absolutely amazing. I agree with some of the other reviews about the lyrics. The most essential part of Tool music are the lyrics. Thats what catches you, stops you and rips your mind apart. Tool has shown in every possible way how much they have evolved from their last album in every possible way. <br /> <br />Any Tool fan will love it and any new listener will be amazed by the music & vocals and will want to listen to it again n again n again n again.
B000A59PMO|5.0|Without a doubt the best first season of any show I've ever seen. Tight-plotting, crackling dialogue, a spectacular cast -- Veronica Mars has it all.<br /><br />Don't miss this gem!
B0000027RL|5.0|It is a sacreliege to give this excellent album from Pearl Jam anything less than 4 stars.I cant think of of a better album from the nineties than Ten.This album flat out rocks with kick ass songs like ALIVE,EVEN FLOW,BLACK and JEREMY.Get this with Vs,Vitalogy and their self titled album.
630587493X|5.0|Just one word describes this film: AWFUL!!!!!!!!!!!! <br />I expected a LOT more from Robin Williams! What complete idiot <br />would think this is a comedy!??! <br /> <br />If you consider listening to those other buffoons who liked <br />this film, DON'T! this is a dirty film!
B00000613T|3.0|This recording is 3/4ths of an extraordinary performance of this symphony.  The first movement is perhaps one of the finest ever recorded, which means many listeners will find it perfect.  It breathes, it flows, it rages, it soothes, it's magnificient.  The playing is as fine as can be.<br /><br />The middle movements are also wonderfully shaped and performed, but then comes the finale, when it all falls apart, which is a shame.  The first problem to solve in presenting this work is the linking, in weight and breadth of time, of the two main movements, 1 and 4, which are bookends in the complete sense:  the work is contained and controlled by them.  While they don't need equal weight, they need comparable weight, comparable seriousness and exploration.  And here, after that wonderful beginning, Boulez rushes through the last movement, not just failing to answer the questions the first presents, but ignoring their very presence.  While his fans may enjoy it, this is not successful Mahler.
0385493622|5.0|This book is great for anyone not intimately familiar with the history of Fermat's Last Theorem.  I read in another review that mathematicians should not buy this book.  I disagree.  While I myself skimmed a couple dozen pages of elementary math, most of this book is the history surrounding the famous theorem.  To suggest that mathematicians not read this is like telling physicists \\"don't watch Einstein's Big Idea on Nova.\\"  This book is wonderful entertainment for those with deep roots in math, or for those amateurs with only the slightest of understanding.
B00005ATQD|1.0|I saw this movie in the theatre with my boyfriend (now husband) and 2 of our friends.  I had not been involved with the furor surrounding this film and I was/am pretty indifferent about Kubrick in general.  Our friends were rabid Kubrick fans, and could not wait to have his last \\"masterpiece\\" glowing in front of their eyes. <br /> <br />As many of you have stated, I want the 3 hours (which at the time of viewing felt more like 143 hours) back that I threw away watching this film.  I have never seen anything more poorly written, poorly directed, and poorly acted in all my life.  Cruise is dreadful. Kidman is worse.  And the (in)famous scene at the orgy was, in actuality, pretty laughable; especially since it had to be censored for American audiences by having robed persons strategically CGIed over the more obvious sexual activities.  The music, attempting to be dramatic, to heighten the pseudo-surreal nature of the film, and to build tension was literally hilarious.  About halfway through the film, the audience started laughing out loud whenever that lame piano would start playing (one key being struck over and over and over).   <br /> <br />I think the worst part of the film is the ending, which is excruciatingly weak.  It's like the movie stopped, rather than ended.  Kidman (I believe) has the last line, which is so absolutely stupid and contrived that it diminishes the film in its entirety, bringing it down (even though it was pretty bad to begin with) to utter tripe.   <br /> <br />This might be the worst movie I have ever seen.
B0006Z2LH4|4.0|I haven't seen the two previous CUBE movies, but I understand this is sort of a \\"prequel\\" to them.  Admittedly a bizarre little film, it's an innovative and eerily effective little chiller that plays on the Big Brother concept to the fullest.  The setting and special effects are above average for an independent low budget film, and Zachary Bennett as the geek hero and Michael Riley as the one-eyed corporate exec give good performances.  A downbeat ending is inevitable, and the movie's plot not entirely resolved, but CUBE ZERO is a dandy little film.
0060764899|5.0|A world of fantasy that leads the reader to the victory of good over evil, C.S. Lewis has written an enjoyable children's story that allures to the Christian religion.  Four children, Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy are sent to live with a professor in a huge old house.  Inside a wardrobe in one of the many rooms is a passageway to the world of Narnia where mythical creatures live alongside the mundane animals. However, in Narnia the White Witch has placed a spell on the land so that it is \\"always winter and never Christmas.\\"  The four children travel with friendly beavers to meet Aslan, the great lion who can defeat the White Witch.  He leads them to fight the Witch's allies to restore the beauty and goodness of Narnia. <br />The events and characters in the novel take everyone back to childhood dreams of unicorns, talking animals, and glorious victories.  The reader becomes captivated by the plight of the four children and their quest to save Narnia.  The children are alluring because of their innocence.  The clear line between good and evil aids the flow and understanding of the story.  The imagery describing Aslan captivates the reader, creating a mysterious character who is kind yet fearsome and who cares for all the people.  This imagery draws the reader to love Aslan just as much as the children love him.  The clear distinction between the awesome goodness of Aslan and the evil treachery of the Witch fuels the reader's desire to learn of Narnia's fate.  The fate of the creatures the White Witch has turned to stone also keeps the reader on the edge of his or her seat.  The reader wishes to keep reading because of the foreshadowing of a great battle and the prophecy that the children will ascend to the throne of the Castle Paravel and defeat the Witch.     <br /> The sentences seem awkward at time, but this is due to Lewis' writing style.  He writes as if he is talking, relaying the story to a group of children.  The wording is simplistic and there are quite a few moments where he recaps the story or explains mundane actions.  This style is ideal for children because the explanatory comments help children to better understand the story, and it helps adults to remember what occurred earlier in the novel.  C.S. Lewis switches between a narrative of the Witch's actions and Aslan's actions throughout the middle section of the novel.  Lewis will break one story at a climax point and return to the other which causes the reader to continue in order to discover the answers to the questions in the last chapter.   <br />C.S. Lewis continuously alludes to the Bible, making the story a great study for Christian groups.  The name Peter connects the apostle, the head of the Church, to the boy whom Aslan trusts to head the battle against the evil White Witch.  Edmund, the youngest boy is related to Judas.  Edmund meets the White Witch and is taken in by her magic.  Just as Judas was enchanted by the allure of money, Edmund betrays the whereabouts of his siblings and Aslan while under the spell of the White Witch.  However, Aslan frees Edmund.  Edmund repents and is forgiven, just as Judas would have been had he not killed himself.   Also, the many prophesies throughout the novel allure to the prophesies in the Old Testament about Jesus' life and death.  The connections continue, but would give away the rest of the story. <br />Lewis' novel is a great read for all people because of its adventure and mystery.  The courageous children's fight to save Narnia is a childhood dream come true.  All will fall in love with this novel.  It is not just a book for Christians, but it is a book for all longing for adventure in mystical lands.   <br />
B000E6ESL2|3.0|I have to admit that after viewing STAY I was disappointed in its muddled and oftentimes confusing plot. But thanks to several reviews here on Amazon, some points helped clarify what happened and I agree that the ending negated the movie's main proposition.  With that in mind, there are many good things about this surrealistic venture.  Ryan Gosling is especially good as Henry, having the soulfully sad face that contradicts a lot of his previous films.  Ewan McGregor is also good in his role as the sympathetic and ultimately scary psychiatrist, and Naomi Watts is fine as always.  The movie has some interesting cinematic techniques and although it's not totally clear, STAY is definitely an original experience.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|Stadium Arcadium is yet another brilliant album, unlike By The Way the reltionship in the band is much better and Flea once again shines in the quality and difficulty of his bassing on the album, he is the best bassist in the world. Critics say this is Johns album, he really does show what he can do and unlike previous works has many fantastic guitar solos, both Flea and John perform out of this world. <br /> <br />This album is a 28 track double cd, which is a lot. At first a lot of tracks sounds similar but after a few listens you will find speialities and influences in each, and you will not be able to help singing along or air guitaring, its amazing.  <br />There are some absolutely brilliant songs, and some that you will call just good. But the majority in my view are brillaint and songs like Snow (hey oh) rival previous monster like Under The Bridge, Califonrications and Otherside. Snow has perhaps the best guitaring on the album, so fast!, but still excellent for a slow song. The chorus is just beautiful. There are also brillaint fast and funky songs like Charlie and Hump de Bump and Torture uses a trumpets to give it a really fun and funky feeling.  <br /> <br />Most critics say that RHCP are slipping into a comfort zone on the end of a long career like U2 and REM, buth that is absolutely not true and infact the technical difficulty and song writing just gets better and better, and this album is my favourite along with Californications. <br /> <br />You will not regret buying this album and for the amount of good songs on here it is the bargain of all albums, i would pay 10 times the price for this
B000F48CD8|4.0|I was a little disappointed with this. I suppose I expected a Jack White album backed by a full band.  While the first song holds much promise, the rest of the album seems rather lukewarm with a few nice flourishes.<br /><br />While the title track is almost on par with the first song, Steady as She Goes, as solid edgy rockers, the ballads like Yellow Sun and Together sound barely in the league of lukewarm Wilco.<br /><br />This seems to be a band self-consciously trying to write \\"songs\\" instead of kicking out the jams and having fun as the British super-group band, The Brakes, did on their recent album \\"Give Blood.\\"<br /><br />Even on an attempt at the blues on \\"Blue Vein\\" it all sounds a little forced and deliberate.  Same goes for such songs as Call it a Day that has a stodgy 60s tone to it that doesn't quite make it.<br /><br />Store Bought Bones shows the most potential with the sort of frenetic guitar work that always punctuated the best of a White Stripes album.  But there isn't enough of these touches on this album.<br /><br />When the hype clears on this band, we'll see if this art-rock vein isn't a bit confining for the great Mr. White.
B000B5IPLK|2.0|I absolutely adore Alicia Keys and her phenominal talent.  I enjoy listening to her rich vocals and emotional buy in to every song she sings.  BUT, the arrangements of these songs are so WRONG on this recording, it was a humongous distraction that I could not get past.  It felt like I was hearing some of the songs for the first time; not something I was liking.  Nearly every song was dipped in a jazz tone, which certainly did not accentuate her R&B style.  The background vocals were too funky at times and the supporting band was anything but smooth. <br /> <br />One plus for this album was it was Alicia Keys after all.  I'm glad to hear her perform, but just not these arrangements.  This CD will either gather dust on my shelf or be eBayed, sad to say. <br /> <br />Bottom line:  Even die hard Alicia Keys fans may have trouble digesting this, soley on the crummy arrangements it brings.
B00000JR2A|5.0|One of the best albums of the last 20 years, and I have listened to alot of albums
B000E1YVZU|4.0|I haven't seen the Broadway show, so I can't compare the two. <br /> <br />I'm always a little apprehensive of musicals, having people burst into song in the middle of a movie always has a tendency of making me cringe because it's so corny. <br />I have to admit, I loved this movie.   <br /> <br />I loved the fact that most of the actors were the originals who were on Broadway, so they knew what they were doing, which saves the film from any huge embarassments. <br />Most of the songs are pretty catchy, I especially liked \\"Seasons of Love\\", \\"Take Me Or Leave Me\\" and the performance that came with \\"Today 4 U\\" was amazing. <br /> <br />Although I did cringe once or twice, the movie stays really enjoyable, I had a lot of fun watching it, which surprised me because half of the characters have AIDS, so i'll give props for being able to talk about this sensitive, relatively gloomy, subject and still being able to pull off an upbeat movie, at least most of the time.  And even when it does get somewhat depressing and sad, it manages to stay relatively positive. <br /> <br />Overall, while Rent doesn't have the same quality or magic that Chicago had, it still has plenty enough, and makes this an enjoyable experience.  Plus the extras in this edition are great.
B000001FN1|5.0|Warlock made one truly great album in their time and this is it. Forget the earlier stuff, this is where you should start to explore this band, who were before their time in a number of ways.<br /><br />It's a pity that for this album the band jettisoned their previous long time guitarist Peter Szigeti and had enlisted a couple of North American chaps into the band as this will perhaps diminish it's worth in some eyes. But that would be a pity as it's an excellent, excellent release. Those who flick through my other reviews will note that it's rare for me to give an album five stars but this one deserves it.<br /><br />A track by track synopsis would be;<br /><br />All We Are:  A real soccer holler crowd effect lets you know this is still Warlock as this is an effect they'd used previously. The track is a great opening cut and a good statement of intent.<br /><br />Three Minute Warning: This is true metal. What in the 90's and beyond started to be termed power metal. This album does represent the completion of the ideas of the previous album, in terms of it being a serious assault on the charts and the the hard rock scene of the late 80's, but the band could still pull out some serious metal. Doro goes off over a solid metal stomper.<br /><br />I Rule the Ruins:  A more melodic slow cruiser with great vocal lines and melody. The production values on this album are really top notch, sounding like it was recorded yesterday and this helps the band go up and down the gears.<br /><br />Kiss of Death:  More atmospherics with somewhat creepy overtones, but that was on purpose it would seem. A sense of danger and foreboding beyond the ken of many bands at the time who just went for over the top viciousness. Here Warlock uses intelligent lyrics and arrangements to better effect that just going over the top.<br /><br />Make Time for Love:  Ballad #1 for this album. Which is a bit of a respite after you've been clubbed by the first four tunes.<br /><br />East Meets West:  This song gels perfectly. A simple idea lyrically married to an excellent hook. Other reviewers have noted the excellent contribution to this album by one Tommy B on guitar and I'd have to concur. The guys in the band as a unit seem able to play melody or face melting metal with equal aplomb.<br /><br />Touch of Evil:  Another out and out metal track here. Doro coaxing all sorts of banshee wails out of her larynx. The whole thing proceeds to a crescendo of chaos (in the best possible way) that is just slightly reminiscent of the Scorpions tune Virgin Killer - ie the end bit where Klaus Meine really lets go into the upper end of his register.<br /><br />Metal Tango:  A metal track in Tango time. It's the arrangement rather than the fairly simple lyrics that make this track work. Following a full metal racket like Touch of Evil with this tune was excellent track sequencing.<br /><br />Cold, Cold World:  This is almost a ballad, but if you wanted to put it into that category you'd have to call it one of the most bleak ballads out there. Over a slightly understated musical delivery Doro belts out in angst at the injustices of the world rather than plaintively whining about it. An interesting combination.<br /><br />Fur Immer:  Doros solo albums show a penchant for songs performed in her native German. To my knowledge this is the first time she did it. This track must be huge in Germany presumably and despite most of the planet can't understand it's lyrics it's always exhumed for Warlock and/or Doro compilation albums. Which is a pointer towards the effect it has on the listener.<br /><br />Overall if your a fan of metal, buy this. If your into the wave of female fronted metal acts then buy this. If you love clean crisp guitar heavy hard rock, by this. If your into 80's metal and hard rock, then pick this up. It something that lovers of so many types of metal can enjoy./>East Meets West:   This song gels perfectly. A simple idea lyrically married to an excellent hook.

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Ok, so it's not Colin Firth in the BBC miniseries, but it's still a great movie, I enjoyed every minute of it. <br /> <br />It's a beautiful movie in every aspect.  The scenery is absolutely amazing, and when it is put together with the music like it is, the result is breathtaking.  Keira Knightley and MacFadyen are great, and there's great chemistry between the two, and it's all very innocent and pure, which is a nice change. <br />The supporting cast is also amazing, making the movie even better. <br /> <br />It's not a slow movie, as in you won't be bored out of your mind at any time, it has a nice pace to it.  But it is slow in the way that it takes its time and it's not hectic in any way, which is exactly how it should be. I think the word to describe the pace would be \\"relaxing\\".   <br />You'll laugh, cry, smile, it's a beautiful emotional ride, with beautiful music to accompany you through the journey. <br /> <br />It might truly be the greatest love story of all time.  <br />This movie is a pure gem, and one of the best I've seen.
B00005JO9J|5.0|Only one word can describe how I feel about Grey's Amatomy in general and that word is LOVE.  I think this has to be the best show on television.  I bought the first season, even though I had already seen them all but, after watching them like 5 times each I realized that I would find something new each time.  I can't wait until season 2 is released, I will be one of the firsts ones to buy it.  I cry every time I watch a show, the worst one was when the guy from the bomb squad exploded, I couldn't believe it, I thought Meredith was dreaming. <br />Well that's it. <br />5 stars Baby!!!!
B000BTJDGC|4.0|The Exorcism of Emily Rose was everything I'd hoped it would be. The hairs on the back of my neck stood on end and I was left with the same creeped-out feeling I had for Mothman Prophecies (which to this day, no matter how many times I watch that one, it freaks me out). In my book, that's excellent, although I would not recommend watching this alone at night. Or at least not alone period. The movie was very well done and captivating. My best friend and I absolutely enjoyed this Exorcism. It ropes you in from the beginning with a riveting tale based on a true story. It's something I will no doubt watch again and again, though only in the company of friends who don't mind helping me check my closets before they go home. If you like this genre, you will definitely enjoy watching this.
B0000DZ3EN|5.0|This film is a highly underrated masterpiece. Why it is underrated is for several reasons. Several audience members do not understand the true beauty of Oz. It's not a sing-a-long fairytale lala land. Oz is a place of the imagination. A place where dreams are possible, but reality still lies with in this imaginary land.     The classic American fairy tale, \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" struck audiences in awe because of the fact that it was in color, the songs at the time were probably about the best thing anyone had really ever heard from a movie from a musical standpoint; and the whole concept of a place where all the joy and wonders could be escaped.     Think again. First off, this really isn't a sequel because it takes place in 1899, closer to 1900 when the original books where first produced, which would've been a good 31 years or so to when the first movie took place. The original movie took place during 1939 when the movie was made, because if you check the Munchkin Coroner's sign it says that the Witch died on May 6th (I believe, it's not the exact date but around there), 1938 (when they started shooting). So, thusly the movie took place around that time period. This movie is a continuation of the books by L. Frank Baum.    Now, plot summary. Dorothy Gale (potrayed by ten-year-old Fairuza Bulk) is back in Kansas roughly six months after the tornado. Aunt Em is uncertain of Dorothy's mental stamina, since all she talks about is this place called \\"Oz\\". She sends her to Dr. Wooly, a psychatrist/doctor a couple of miles away. Dr. Worley tries to attempt eletricial shock on Dorothy. Dorothy is escourted out of the \\"asylum\\" by a mysterious worker. Dorothy escapes and swims away in a river.     Dorothy arrives in Oz, with her talking hen Billina. Billina & Dorothy find Oz in a wretched state. The munchkins, yellow brick road, Scarecrow and Emerald City are gone. The Emerald City has turned to stone and is now being inhabited by a headless creature named Mombi, (by headless Imean she has different heads, she actually keeps heads in cabinents to put on. She has worn three throughout the film, Mombi was actually Princess Langwire in the book, Ozma of Oz) and Mombi has these creepy slaves named the Wheelers, who have wheels for feet.    Dorothy, not knowing where to turn, ends up being chased by these \\"Wheelers\\" and finds a robot named Tik-Tok; who eventually scares off the Wheelers. Tik-Tok is now Dorothy slave, and they seek Mombi to tell her what has happened to the Scarecrow, the Emerald City, etc. Mombi tells her the Nome King is now King of Oz and has imprisioned the Scarecrow and has taken back all the Emeralds in the Emerald City.    Mombi imprisions Dorothy all of a sudden because she wants her [Dorothy's] head. Dorothy is now in Mombi's well--I guess you'd call it a storage room with no doors, which is supposidly a \\"dungeon\\" but whatever. Dorothy meets this thing, yes I said \\"thing\\" called Jack Pumpkinhead which was created by Ozma (the Queen of Oz) to scare off Mombi, who was later imprisoned by Mombi as a slave of the mirror, (meaning she is trapped inside a mirror) and so Ozma being Jack's creator, Jack refers to Ozma only as \\"Mom\\" not knowing her real name throughout various parts of the film.    Pumpkinhead has a Pumpkin for a head, and sticks and a shirt and pants for a body and was brought to life by some magical powder of Life. Long story short, Dorothy steals the power from Mombi's original head which is in a cabinent, goes back upstairs to Tik-Tok, Jack and Billina and they bring this thing called a \\"Gump\\" to life. A Gump is like a moose, but it's green and it can talk. So, the Gump is only a Gump's head on a plaque on the wall. They make the Gump's head come to life, then get some sofas and palm tree leaves, and put them all together to make a flying contraption with the help of the Powder of Life.    They escape Mombi's palace, fly to the Nome Kings Mountain. The Nome King, they find is an arrogent jerk who is made out of stone and lives underground in the mountain and stole all the Emeralds from the Emerald City and has turned the Scarecrow into an ornament. So, all the gang [Jack, Gump, Tik-Tok, Dorothy and Ballina] play a guessing game to guess which ornament is the Scarecrow. Well, in a short context they find the Scarecrow, find the Ruby Slippers and Dorothy wishes that all of Oz would be back to normal.    All of Oz turns into the beautiful city it once was, Ozma is freed from the mirror, the Nome King dies, and Mombi is powerless. It's all happy until Dorothy declines being Queen of Oz and staying in Oz forever. So she goes home and finds that the asylum has burned down to the ground when an electrical storm hit and that Dr. Wooly is in jail and his assistant, Nurse Wilson is also in jail. So it's all grand and happy.    I know that was long, but it's a majestic, beautiful work of art and is frowned upon for the wrong reasons.    Highly Reccomend!
B000AL730O|5.0|I am certainly a McCartney fan and I follow everything he does.  I even found a beautiful contribution he wrote in Stephanie Lerner's poignant book \\"Kids Who Think Outside The Box. This album is innovative and  creatively McCartney.  It's worth buying. He is a living legend.
B000EOTAM6|4.0|I loved it i guess most of the people that disagree are the ones who are not fimilar with the series,<br /><br />And for those who know about it can't expect the whole series to be squeeze in one movie<br /><br />I enjoyed it and the special effects was good of course they did a few minor changes but i've seen worst series turn to movie so can't really complain
B000E8QVWY|5.0|I'm always a little hesitant to watch biographical films such as Walk the Line, especially when they are based on someone I consider a personal favorite.  Johnny Cash was the man - then, now, and forever.  Heck, the one and only album my parents and I both own is Johnny Cash at Folsom Prison.  I didn't really want to learn anything that might damage my opinion of the man.  Complicating matters, you always have to wonder how much of what you are seeing is accurate and how much is the product of embellishment added to make the story more compelling.  Obviously, I already knew Johnny Cash was no angel in his younger days, but I think Walk the Line does succeed in presenting some of his mistakes and problems in a respectful, realistic way.<br /><br />As good as the movie is, it does have some weaknesses.  Naturally, it can't cover Johnny's whole life in detail (nor does it try to), but some aspects of the story could have used more depth and character exploration.  I remember hearing that some relatives of Johnny's first wife weren't all that thrilled with her characterization in the film.  Frankly, I found it hard to judge her at all because we never really learn much about her.  One minute, we see Johnny calling her from overseas, then the next they're married, and then Johnny finally hits it big and goes out on the road.  His wife comes across as a rather shrewish sort, and that's unfortunate because she should be a more sympathetic character in this context.  As far as Johnny and June Carter go, I would like to have seen their relationship ironed out a little bit more, as well.  From the things we see Johnny do in this film, it's difficult for me to understand why June kept coming back to him - as a singer or as a friend.  Even as their relationship grew into love, I never really saw any kind of special spark in their eyes for one another.<br /><br />Joaquin Phoenix does a fairly good job in the title role, but I was never able to look at him and see Johnny Cash the way I could look at Jamie Foxx in Ray and see Ray Charles.  The man in black was one-of-a-kind, especially in terms of his voice, and I think Phoenix just tried too hard at times to become the man behind the music.  He especially over-emphasizes Cash's mannerisms onstage, and that just kept disconnecting me from the film.  Casting Reese Witherspoon as June Carter ended up being the Hollywood coup of the year, as she does turn in a wonderful performance, but somebody was asleep at the wheel when some of the other cast members were selected.  Personally, I think terrible mistakes were made in the casting of actors to play Elvis, Roy Orbison, Jerry Lee Lewis, and some other well-known musicians.  Orbison ended up looking like some chess club geek, while Jerry Lee Lewis looked like he should have been hanging wallpaper somewhere, far away from any stage.  It's like they cast some of these parts by pulling random names out of a hat or something.<br /><br />Despite the questionable casting decisions and some obvious gaps in the chronology of the film, Walk the Line does tell a compelling story about a true icon of the twentieth century.  One of the qualities that made Johnny Cash unique was his humanity.  No matter how big he got, he always seemed to be one of us, a regular guy who made mistakes just like we all do.  That's why the Folsom Prison album seems to stand at the very nexus of Cash's career - even hardened criminals felt like Johnny was one of them.  If he could turn his life around after hitting rock bottom, so could any of them - or us.  I think this inspirational message could have been communicated a little more effectively in the movie, but it certainly makes the story worth telling.  Johnny Cash fan or not, Walk the Line is a movie worth watching.Cash the way I could look at Jamie Foxx in Ray and see Ray Charles.  The man in black was one-of-a-kind, especially in terms of his voice, and I think Phoenix just tried too hard at times to become the man behind the music.  He especially over-emphasizes Cash's mannerisms onstage, and that just kept disconnecting me from the film.  Casting Reese Witherspoon as June Carter ended up being the Hollywood coup of the year, as she does turn in a wonderful performance, but somebody was asleep at the wheel when some of the other cast members were selected.

B000BW7QWW|5.0|This is an amazing movie based on an even better show!  Each of the actors is cast perfectly, particularly Chiwetel Ejifor as the Operative and Summer Glau as River.  The humor is great, the action and special effects entertaining and the characters are facinating.  The story of criminals fighting against the perfect society and seeking to make the truth known never gets old.  If you are avoiding this movie because of the bad reviews, don't! It is well worth seeing even if you are not a fan of the genre.  By the way, I recommend watching Firefly before the movie for backstory and character development.
B0006I0SEO|1.0|Well here we go again.  Hollywood boy-du-jour gets to do whatever he wants with the producers money.  And this is what we get.  Total self-indulgence.  \\"Dramatic masterpiece\\" one reviewer called it!??  Well, where exactly is the dramatic logic in the plot's central turning point, that Clementine, presumably because of her oh-so endearing \\"impulsive character,\\" decided to erase boyfriend Joel from her memory?  Where or where in these 2 hours is the justification for such an act?  This is just a presumed plot device, and one that would fool juveniles who are smoking too much pot to notice - to notice anything except how \\"cool\\" it is that Stan and Mary are fooling around while Joel lies there getting his brain drained.  Remember that Stan was introduced by his boss as \\"one of our most experienced workers.\\"  Come on!  Who is Charlie Kaufman fooling?  He's just an impulsive kid who never in a million years would be entrusted with such a responsibility.  And by the way, speaking of responsibility, Stan's unethical behavior pales in comparison to Patrick's: the little monster stole someone's identity and tried to pass himself off as \\"deeper\\" than he is so that he could win Clementine's affections.  His ethical breach of his job was, in my opinion, extremely grave.  Does this film even once make the slightest effort to bring this spoiled lying thief to justice?  Think about that one for a minute. No, he's completely forgotten about in the end - dispensed with once his nasty role is over.  But that's all in the spirit of this film, where everybody gets away with everything and even the characters we're supposed to like are so dispicable that all they do is leave a terrible taste in the mouth. <br /> <br />This film has no respect for it audience's intelligence.  It fools you into thinking it's deep and keeps you busy trying to figure it out while it's reaching for your pocketbook.  Be careful - this film might erase your critical faculties!!
B000EOTAM6|5.0|When I saw the trailer for this movie, I was really excited about the prospect of a sci-fi/action film starring a woman.  I lost interest after I read the reviews and realized that it was forgotton by everyone once it came out.  However, I rented it recently to find out that I LOVE THIS MOVIE!  It is a truly original, exciting, and visually appealling masterpiece that showcases not only the talented Charlize Theron but humanitarian and ethical issues like cloning and government control.  The other thing that I didn't expect was the love story within the epic. It really made the movie to have that little bit of emotion coupled with the action.  Marton Csokas (Celeborn in The Fellowship of the Ring) did an outstanding job as dictator Trevor Goodchild and Sithandra was also a good character.  All in all the bizarre mix of sci-fi, action/adventure, and romance worked out very nicely.  Don't always believe the reviews!
B0000069CT|5.0|The Bruch 3rd Violin Concerto sounds like the younger sister of the Brahms Violin Concerto.  However, the sister is less serious and much sexier.<br /><br />One of the reasons I stopped going to symphony concerts was the constant repetition of a few concertos.  The Tchaikovsky, Brahms, Beethoven, etc. concerti are played so often, most regular concertgoers must have them memorized.  A friend of mine thinks conductors do not want to use their very limited rehearsal time on concerti so only the most familiar are played. If that is the case, why not simply play an over familiar symphony when you play a unfamiliar concerto.  Everything would balance out.  The Bruch 3rd Violin Concerto is a wonderful piece, especially the highly heroic second theme of the first movement.  It should be played much more often.<br /><br />Fortunately, it is gaining ground.  Amazon now lists 5 recordings of the piece.  However, none of them are by the most famous violinists.  Salvadore Accordo was a sensational violinist when he recorded all the works on this double CD but he was never as famous as Perlman.  But Perlman only recorded the first concerto of Bruch, as is the case with almost every famous violinist for the last 100 years.  Hopefully, that will change.<br /><br />As I said Accordo was a sensational violinist with a tone that was huge and beautiful and a technique second to none.  The performances here are first class in every way.  This CD should be in every serious collection.

B000EHSVQ4|2.0|Muhammed Zaida and other reviewers who have pointed out the movie's general historical flaws (aww, heck, let's just admit it, lack of history), have actually been quite restrained. <br /> <br />You could, literally fill pages with the historical and social errors of this film, which are, like Aleksander Nevskiy, more a reflection on the people making the film, than of the subject.  Where AN was Russian \\"Big Slavic Brother\\" nationalism via the Soviets, this movie is the last great gasp of politically-correct multiculturalism. <br /> <br />this film features <br />a)bad acting <br />b)clarifications that supposedly fix the character flaws, but in actuality, make them *worse* <br />c)a quick trip to totally misunderstanding the crusades <br />d)shiny costumes that are surprisingly good for a Hollywood movie <br />e)some nice fight scenes. <br />f)powerfully-directed modern propaganda (the purpose of the film) <br /> <br />I intend to buy extra copies so that I can listen to my (medieval archaeologist) wife scream.  But take anybody who gives this 4 or 5 stars a serious look-see -- it's likely they're better suited to reviewing pablum like XXX instead.
1400079179|2.0|Since the time of creation humankind has searched in vain for answers to our earthly existence and fate beyond the grave. In the beginning, primitive societies worshipped rocks, the spirits of the dead, ridiculous deities and so on. In 2006 nothing has changed. We continue to contrive answers to eons old questions while allowing religious and literary opportunists to fill up their pockets on account of secular emptyheadedness.<br /><br />Humankind lacks the capacity to satisfy these questions, so we either choose to have faith in Divine Providence or fall prey to mind manipulators. The success of the Da Vinci Code is not due to literary or artistic merits but to people searching for answers in the wrong direction. Nothing is sacred anymore.<br /><br />Andrew J.

B000099T2L|4.0|I thouroughly enjoyed this album.  Could it have been better, slightly.  Could it have been worse, definitely.  The majority of the fast tracks provided a good dance beat and the ballads showcased her vocal abilities.  On another note this space is to be used for giving feedback on albums not gripes.  If you don't enjoy a particular artist, don't listen to them.  It's that simple.
B000EULJLU|3.0|I got this CD for free, but the circumstances behind getting it for free were less than impressive:<br /><br />Me: \\"I hope a used one comes in so that I can get it for cheap like you did.\\"<br />Coworker: \\"Actually, now that I've listened to it, I was very very disappointed.  If you want it, it's yours.\\"<br />Me: \\"Score, let's see...\\" *digs into pockets* \\"I have fifty cents... want a soda in payment?\\"<br />Coworker: \\"That's unnecessary, you can just have it.\\"<br /><br />Yeah, that's what I consider very telling of this CD.  Add to that that almost everyone I asked said, \\"It's exactly like how I imagined it would be, which means it's superfluous because I've already imagined it and thus don't need to even hear it,\\" and \\"It sounds just like Lateralus,\\" and also that I had heard \\"Vicarious\\" with a friend of mine on the radio a little while ago and we both went a good three minutes or so before realizing we weren't listening to \\"Schism\\"...  you get the picture.<br /><br />But hey guess what, even with all that negative previewing I've heard, I still kinda like it.  I like it because it's distinctive Tool and it sounds pleasant.<br /><br />But oh, the reviews are right.  It IS exactly how I imagined it would be.  It IS a lot like Lateralus.  It IS all those complaints.<br /><br />It's just that it's fun to listen to, kind of like the occassional Hollywood remake.  Same story, same jokes, same bland characters, but sometimes you need something to go into a movie theatre and ignore while you grope your date.  That's what this album is, great stuff to listen to in that it's not offensively bad, but not necessarily something you can sit around devoting too much time with because eventually it would just get boring.  Best play it while going on to do some other activity.<br /><br />It's like the \\"unique\\" packaging.  It's typical Tool artwork that includes glasses to make it three dimensional.  Is it creative, or is it Magic Eye?  Whatever the aspirations behind it, I still think that ultimately it just makes for difficulties with shelf space.<br /><br />--PolarisDiBlf space.    --PolarisDiB

B00006RCNJ|5.0|Andre Rieu puts on a fine show.  He is always warm, enthusiastic, and full of good-humor.  This outing is no different.  Sometimes the selections overlap other concerts.  (The one in Vienna particularly has some overlap, but the extra purchase is worth it.)  The reader should note that the song selection was incorrectly given for the product.      This set of songs is perhaps the most lively and varied.  There are waltzes, beautiful symphonic songs, ethnic pieces, and jazz numbers.  The timing is great, cutting back and forth from orchestra and audience close-ups back to the maestro, Andre Rieu.  This recording should squash forever the stereotypes that the Brits are stuffy people.  They are invited to waltz in the aisles, while the rest just sway their arms and clap their hands.  The festive atmosphere is accentuated with falling balloons and confetti, dropped to a cheering crowd.  His regard for them is often facetious.  He mimics them as stoney-faced before he cajoles them to dance to Strauss, the way it is meant to be.  He also tells them they will perform Beethoven's Fifth in its entirety, which garners a laugh.  He makes good on his word for a few bars, then segues to \\"Brazil Symphony\\".  One feels transported by the hyjinx on stage and the occasional aerial and street shots of Big Ben, London Bridge, the double-decker busses, etc.    The content is also the most widely eclectic of his DVD's.  They perform intricate ethnic classics like \\"Hava Nagila,\\" \\"Salome' Sobridame,\\" and \\"Sirtaka Sorbasma\\" (sp?).  The mood swings from the lively and playful \\"Finiculi Finicula,\\" and the British \\"Tea for Two,\\" to the beautifully mournful \\"Nun's Tale\\" from 'Cassanova'.  Waltzes are forefront with the unabashed \\"The Blue Danube,\\"  as well as \\"The Skater's Waltz\\".  There are marches including \\"Radesky March\\" and \\"Stars and Stripes\\".  Jazz seems to finish the bill with some jazz-age sounding numbers, including \\"Glen Miller Melody,\\" \\"The 'Andre' Sisters,\\" and \\"The Second Waltz\\".Andre Rieu has reinvented the symphony.  This DVD is an entertaining and engaging reinactment of a festive evening, worthy of owning and reliving again and again.  This is no mere \\"Pops\\" concert, but a great show with a fine orchestra and an entertaining maestro.
1400079179|1.0|I read this book quite awhile back before all the buzz about it. I was not impressed with the storyline and hope no one is misled into trying to accept was the author cites as facts and use them for the purpose of embellishing your views of Christ and the Gospel. Consider this --> The Bible is intended to be \\"stand-alone\\" and \\"infallible\\" (and also contains severe warnings about \\"adding to or subtracting from it\\".) These are basic tenents of Christianity. If these tenets are NOT held to be true then it stands to reason that it would be silly to place your faith and eternal destiny in the Bible and Christianity. BUT, if they are held to be true then it logically follows that to try and \\"explore ones faith\\" by accepting the baseless (and insulting) views about Jesus which the author espouses would defy sound reasoning and be 100 percent CONTRADICTORY... i.e. How can the author say it should help people to \\"explore their faith\\" when it is directly contradictory to what their manual of faith (the Bible)says. (To assert that Jesus started a family that would later be involved in orgies!?!? COME ON!!!! Really and truly what is happening here is no different than what happened in the garden of Eden. Satan questions God's Word and will use every lie and trick to get people sidetracked into believing ridiculous things. If you want a good story, look elsewhere; if you want to explore your faith, then read the Bible or a book that helps to understand (not undermine/insult) its teachings. See my other reviews for some awesome books that will help you increase your faith.
B000002GBB|5.0|This is by far, Styx' best album.  This one is a little heavier than The Grand Illusion.  This one contained 2 of Styx' most recognizable songs.  The rest of the album however, is just as great. <br /> <br />1. Great White Hope-5/5.  This is a great, heavy opener from JY.  These are the songs where he is at his best, because he doesn't have the greatest voice.  The rockers are his strong suit. <br />2. I'm OK-5/5.  Another great rocker that could have fit on The Grand Illusion.  A great pipe organ solo from Dennis.  One of his greatest vocals too. <br />3. Sing For the Day-5/5.  A lighter song from Tommy.  The lyrics are very romantic and the music is wonderful.  One of the best songs on here. <br />4. The Message-4/5.  A short synthesizer intro to the next song.  It sounds pretty cool, but might have been better if it was part of the next song instead of its own track. <br />5. Lords of the Ring-4/5.  Written by Dennis and sung by JY.  The song itself is cool.  Slow, heavy song with interesting lyrics, but JY's vocals aren't very good.  Would have been better if it were sung by Dennis. <br />6. Blue Collar Man (Long Nights)-5/5.  Huge hit song from this album.  Heavy, aggressive rocker from Tommy.  Excellent song. <br />7. Queen of Spades-5/5.  Probably my favorite song on this album.  Very atmospheric, before it busts into one of the heaviest guitar riffs in Styx' history.  Perfect song. <br />8. Renegade-5/5.  One of Styx' most well known songs.  Heavy and aggressive song from Tommy.  One of my personal favorites ever.  Excellent. <br />9. Pieces of Eight-5/5.  Great power ballad from Dennis.  The lyrics are great.  He should have stuck to these types of lyrics instead of the more fantasy type stuff.  Excellent song. <br />10. Aku-Aku-5/5.  Beautiful soft instrumental from Tommy.  Excellent way to end the album. <br /> <br />Styx fans already own this album.  But for those who only know them for their overplayed hits, I strongly recommend this album.  Styx get avery bad rap these days, and weren't liked very much by critics at the time, but good music is good music, regardless.  Highly recommended!!
B000008L90|5.0|I have been big fan of Donna Summer. I started eight years ago and I went out looking for every donna summer cd ever made and I have finally completed it and my favorites of her works are her 80s and I have 3 favorites album of the 80s and they are Donna Summer, Cats Without Claws and All Systems Go. I liked Cats Without Claws because I could tell she was trying out things and that she was free to do what she felt like. There Goes My Baby is the best cut from this album and I also like Supernatural Love it had some live energy. I know that a lot of Donna Summer's cd aren't easy to come across. So don't waste time looking for it in stores. Purchase Donna Summer: Cats Without Claws it will be well worth it.. LOL
B00000JCB2|4.0|Now, Limp Bizkit is far from a perfect band (they were decent but recently with the release of 'Results May Vary' they've, for lack of a better word, become sucky) and this album is not perfect but it's FAR from terrible.  Most of these reviews from the nu-metal haters make this out to be the worst album ever released (obviously they haven't heard 'Results May Vary') but in reality it's not that bad.  They wavered a lot from their debut release which in my opinion was golden and if they had stuck to their original formula then they would still be the same kick @$$ band they once were, but here they favor the rap-beats over the heavy guitars, and the rap lyrics over the heavy agro-rock lyrics of 'Three Dollar...' but for what it's worth this is still a really good album.  Opening with the very comercial song 'Just Like This' you know right off the bat that the band you once knew is no more.  There will be no screaming (at least not a lot of it) and yes my friends, there will be rap, but unlike 'Chocolate Starfish...' this album actually finds a nice balance and doesn't irritate.  'Nookie', the first single is a really good choice for it's catchy and aggresive and in your face, and while it's no 'Counterfeit' or even 'Faith' it still stands alone as one of Limp's signature tracks.  You hear the name Limp Bizkit and you think 'Nookie'.  Limp keeps the same vein on tracks like 'Break Stuff' which is simple and heavy and features angry lyrics, and 'I'm Broke' which pretty much does the same.  Limp shines though when they strip things down and give us a mellow, smooth feel on tracks like 'Re-Arranged', 'No Sex' with Aaron Lewis and 'Trust?' which is a personal favorite of mine.  'Nobody Like You' is a highlight and features vocals by Jonathon Davis of KoRn and Scott of STP.  It's straight hard rock without the gimmicks.  '9 Teen 90 Nine' and 'Show me What you Got' are great showcases for the bands ability to make rap mosh worthy, while 'N 2 Gether Now' featuring Method Man is a decent straight up hip-hop track that shows how talented a rapper Fred is...did I say that?  Well, it's true, sort-of.  ANyways, many hate, but I don't for this is still a great album, not perfect, not brilliant, but it's fun and that's what matters.
0385336691|4.0|Taut, well written and pacy thriller.  A excellent entry in the series but not the best.
B000EBEHR2|4.0|After reading all the negative reviews and remembering the weak Sleeping with Ghosts I was a little afraid that Meds would be a great disappointment. But it isn't. I think that Infra Red, Follow the cops back home, Because I want you, Blind and Pierot the Clown are songs that easily belongs to the best of Placebo. <br />This album grows and grows the more you listen to it. Judge for yourself.

B000002UY5|5.0|I've been listening to this albumn for about a year on and off. I've become a big fan of Blind Melon and love their other albumns yet I have to say that they just can't compare to their debut. This albumn is powerful and simply amazing. The first 5 songs are catchy and well composed with searing guitar, strong bass, steady rhythm, and Hoon's extraordinary vocals. The lyrics are well thought out and just great \\"feel good\\" style of funky,folky, rock. The last part of the albumn is where the real gems are however. \\"Change\\" feels somewhat lacking instrumentally but the lyrics and emotion make this beautiful song one of BM's best.  \\"Deserted\\" is an extremely powerful song that will leave you in awe. \\"Holyman\\" has some of the albums best guitar work. \\"Sleepyhouse\\" along with \\"Time\\" is probably the albumns best all-around song-with heartfelt lyrics and fresh interesting compositions. \\"Drive\\" is a great song with the albumns best vocals. \\"Blind Melon\\" has a song for evey mood. From mellow and deep to intense feel good rock and roll this albumn will blow you away. I'd give it ten stars if I could.
B000002ULO|3.0|Re-energized by the Beatles Anthology project, McCartney hit the studio with a few friends (Ringo, Jeff Lynne, Steve Miller, George Martin and his son, James) to record his strongest album in two decades.  Paul plays most of the instruments, with either guitar or vocal help from Miller or Lynne (James appears on one song.)<br /><br />Most of the songs are pretty good, particularly for an artist then 20-some years past his apex.  Flaming Pie is heavy on rockers and uptempo songs but, in typical McCartney fashion, there are several ballads.<br /><br />\\"The Song We Were Singing\\" is a slower number; lyrically, a stroll down memory lane to the swingin' 60's.  It's a rather weak number to open up the album.<br /><br />\\"The World Tonight,\\" the first single, is a guitar-driven pop song.  It's catchy with a nice guitar riff.  One line is Lennon-esque, \\"I go back so far, I'm in front of me.\\"  Maybe that's McCartney-esque, but it certainly has a pinch of ironic cheekiness Paul and John used to like to sneak into songs.<br /><br />Another guitar-powered tune is \\"If You Wanna,\\" a traveling song, as McCartney called it, about taking a ride in a Cadillac and falling in love on the way.<br /><br />\\"Somedays\\" is an acoustic ballad reminiscent of \\"Tug of War,\\" the title track to McCartney's 1982 album.  As ballads go, it's not bad.<br /><br />Like Julian Lennon would later do on his album Photograph Smile, McCartney revives the early Beatles sound in \\"Young Boy,\\" a song that sounds like a million other pop songs of the last 40 years.  Despite the lack of originality, it's a toe-tapper.<br /><br />\\"Calico Skies\\" has a \\"Blackbird\\" or \\"Mother Nature's Son\\" feel to it.  It's a sweet - maybe too sweet - little song with a classic McCartney guitar and vocal melodies.<br /><br />The title track is taken from a brilliant Lennon quip about how the Beatles got their name:  \\"A man on a flaming pie came to me in a vision and said you are Beatles with an 'A.' \\" The song has nothing to do with John's little tale, but it's a solid, upbeat rock song.<br /><br />\\"Heaven on a Sunday\\" features James McCartney on guitar.  It's a slow number - another love song - but it has something of a David Gilmour-style solo.<br /><br />\\"Used to Be Bad\\" is a McCartney-Miller, pseudo-blues duet.  It might remind long-time Macca fans of \\"Not Such a Bad Boy\\" from Give My Regards to Broadstreet.<br /><br />The best song on the album, \\"Souvenir,\\" starts off with a few minor piano chord progressions and builds into a slow rocker with a great guitar riff.  \\"Souvenir's\\" definitely on my list of McCartney's top 20 post-Beatles songs.<br /><br />\\"Little Willow's\\" another lullaby-like song, a little syrupy-sweet, not unlike \\"Put It There\\" from Flowers in the Dirt.<br /><br />The first ever published McCartney/Starkey colloboration, \\"Really Love You\\" would fit in quite nicely on an album like Ram.  Paul himself might call it a \\"sweaty rocker.\\"  A good rock number, it's \\"Looking For You\\" from McCartney II warmed over.<br /><br />\\"Beautiful Night\\" is the other obvious \\"hit\\" - not that it ever did much on the charts - on the album, a ballad with a rock climax.<br /><br />One of the more pleasant songs is \\"Great Day,\\" another quiet acoustic song that could sounds like a White Album or Ram leftover.  They say, \\"Familiarity breeds contempt,\\" but, for some reason, whatever makes this song familiar also lends it its charm.  Songs like this are what McCartney has always done best.<br /><br />There is a lot of Jeff Lynne on this album.  A lot of Traveling Wilburys, Tom Petty (Full Moon Fever era), and \\"Free As a Bird/Real Love\\" bleed through these songs.<br /><br />The cover art is boring.  The songs lack originality but, paradoxically, are likeable because of their familiarity.  That McCartney - or any other artist for that matter - would struggle to find new things to say after nearly 40 years in rock and roll is to be expected.  Flaming Pie is not a great work of art, but it's entertaining.  Sometimes that is all that matters.is not a great work of art, but it's entertaining.  Sometimes that is all that matters.
1592401791|5.0|I have to say I truly enjoyed this book.  I've read books by others that were involved with the Beatles and it always seemed that there was some agenda or point of view they were endlessly pursuing.  Not so with this book.  It seemed to be a fair analysis of what was happening on many levels.  By that I mean the personalities, technical issues and of course the changing times.  The technical aspects with regard to the recording sessions were especially enjoyable.  No computer tricks for these talented engineers!  All in all an extremely enjoyable read.  If you're a Beatles fan this is a must read.  Thanks to Geoff Emerick for telling his story.

B000EULJLU|4.0|How can a band like this put out so few albums, write some of the most ingenious songs, and spend so much time between recording, and then tour infrequently.  Please STOP doing that!, it is driving me insane.  Music needs this band so badly right now more so than even I do! <br /> <br />Their latest offering is no different in terms of greatness that other people have mentioned.  Simply every Tool album opens with such a killer track.  With Undertow it was Intolerance.  With Anenema it was Stinkfist.  With Lateralus it was The Grudge, and now with 10,000 Days the album opens with the crushing rumbling sounds of Vicarious.  An absolutley unbelievable perfect song. <br /> <br />The first thing that comes across about this album compared to their previous ones, is that Maynard seems to have taken a back seat to let his bandmates shine (if I could use that term).  Maynard's vocals are a bit subdued, sometimes burried, sometimes overwhelmed by the frenetic drumming of Carry and Chancellor's superb punchy bass tone and chops, but mostly through Adam Jone's sonic guitar and his phrasing which even involves some awesome one note sustained solos (Jambi).  Maynard isn't belting as often, and on many tracks he comes across as whispering. <br /> <br />This gives the album and absolute musical sonic assault through the somewhat middle Eastern sounding/like songs and stomping drumming.  It is as if Maynard decided to take the focus away from himself and let his band not so much shine... but litteraly soar to the stratosphere. <br /> <br />The first 4 tracks on this CD are not gold, they are litteraly DIAMONDS.. <br /> <br />The second half of the CD (from The Pot onward), goes into familiar experimental Tool soundscapes, and Maynard's vocals change somewhat.  There is the peppering in of follow/filler tunes, but Maynard and the gang always manage something to grab your attention particularly on Rosetta Stoned, and even more so on a great closer... Right In Two. <br /> <br />I don't think the guys have made the absolute perfect album yet.  I am not even sure they can, if I think I heard it, It would probably kill me.   <br /> <br />No band I have heard of in my 20+ years of listening to music hits it so perfectly.  Soaring, Majestic, Grandiose, Mindbending, Pure-Chaotic-Elated-Fury, I can't think of enough adjectives to describe the work these guys make and 10,000 Days is no exception.   <br /> <br />Please make it more often. <br /> <br />Thanks
B000E6ESL2|1.0|Boring, stupid, disjointed, complete waste of time and talent.  Little wonder this film did so poorly at the box office - I saw it based purely on the fact that Ewan McGregor starred in it, and even for a long-time fan, this was a huge dissappointment.  Save your money, and your sanity...skip this movie.
B00003CXC7|4.0|I fell asleep when I tried to watch the film the first time, so I attempted the next morning. Many scenes of in-action, with what I learned later to be one of Hitchcock's blessings upon film, the subjective point of view, although when watching it the first time, was very boring. My second watching proved much more fruitful and I enjoyed puzzling out what was going to happen. For once I was actually wrong about the outcome of the movie, which surprised me. I did identify with the main character; that is a line of work I would like to be in, and often I find myself in the same conundrum he himself is in. The Everyman worked perfectly for me.
B000AMJG4Y|4.0|The eagerly anticipated film follow up to one of the best and highest selling PlayStation games of all time is finally here.  Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children is here in all it's superbly animated and convoluted story glory.  Picking up two years after the final battle between Cloud and Sephiroth, Advent Children finds the city of Midgar in shambles and the children of the city stricken with a mysterious disease called Geostigma.  When a trio of brothers arrive on the scene yearning for \\"Mother\\", the brooding Cloud reluctantly comes back into action to save the city, and his friends.  For newcomers, you'll be scratching your head a lot.  But for those who have fond memories of spending hours upon hours playing one of the greatest RPG's of all time will find plenty to admire here.  Besides Cloud, just about all the faces you remember from the game are here: Tifa, Barrett, Red XIII, Cid, Yuffie, Vincent, Cait Sith, Aeris, and even Reno, Rude, and Rufus Shinra; they're all here.  The animation is superb and light years beyond the promise shown in 2001's Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within, even though that film's story was certainly more involving.  Despite that, Advent Children is a must have for fans of the game who wanted a bit more closure than the ending of the game offered, and even for those unfamiliar with the material but love CGI animated action films, this is worth a look.
B00003CX97|4.0|I was pleased with the result of this film, although I could have seen it end victoriously just as well as tragedic. I would have preferred a more positive ending, although the tragedic ending does serve its purpose. Excellent characterizations on both sides of the war; the culture clash was a pleasure to see. I prefer Shogun though, in terms of contrasting cultures, but they did a well-enough job with the time and material they had with this particular film.
B000EULJLU|3.0|After another five year wait, Tool return with \\"10,000 Days\\", and at first glance, it looks like another instant classic that was worth the wait.  The funky and imaginitive case and artwork are a good sign, as well as opening track \\"Vicarious\\" which features a moody bass line and Maynard James Keenan's haunting voice.  All's well right?  Well, from that point onward, \\"10,000 Days\\" is sadly disappointing.  Like the above Amazon review says, many tracks here are lengthy, which wouldn't be a bad thing if many of the songs here (\\"Lipan Conjuring\\" and \\"Rosetta Stoned\\" in particular) weren't so predictable.  That alone is something I've never seen from Tool, predictability.  That's what made \\"Undertow\\" and \\"Aenima\\" masterworks, the fact that you didn't know or could predict what was going to come next.  With \\"10,000 Days\\", you get the feeling of what is going to come next in terms of tempo, and it nearly kills the album.  However, what saves \\"10,000 Days\\" are solid tracks \\"Vicarious\\", \\"The Pot\\", and \\"Right in Two\\", which harken back to what made Tool such an incredible band in the first place.  Maybe my expectations were too high.  Maybe Maynard, Adam, Justin, and Danny are losing steam.  Who knows, all I can say is that \\"10,000 Days\\" is the most disappointing album of the year, and definitely the worst to come from Tool, but it's still better than a lot of the crud classified as hard rock these days as well.
1400079179|1.0|As so many have said before me, this is a terribly underwhelming novel.  The writing is stilted, the characterization lacking, and the plot predictable while still being improbable.<br /><br />And as for the \\"revelations\\" and the \\"intense amount of research\\" that went into this novel - all I can say to those comments is that they demonstrate the deplorable state of the public education system in the US.  None of the \\"historical facts\\" in the novel were particularly revelatory to me - a product of the public school system in the US, but apparently one of the few who wasn't comatose during history.<br /><br />It's mildly entertaining, and if it gets people to crack open a book, great.  But the controversy is just silly.  Anyone who has their faith seriously challenged by this book was obviously not particularly devout, or at least not very well educated, in the first place.  And, as other critics and commentators have noted, it's terribly sad that it takes this sort of novel to get millions of people to take a serious interest in the history and origins of their religion.<br /><br />In short, I've read Star Trek novels that were more profound, thought-provoking, and better researched.  Not to mention better executed.
B000BNX3B4|1.0|I like John Cusack movies, I like Diane Lane.  I hated this movie. The writing is bad, the directing is bad.  Cusack and Lane are good, but they cannot save this movie.  Do yourself a favor if you want a love story with Cusack get Serendipity.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|Lots of reviewers have blasted this album because it doesn't sound like the Peppers of old. That's bogus. Anyone who listens to \\"Stadium Arcadium\\" and isn't blown away by the Flea/Frusciante wall of sound is just being difficult. Where did Frusciante come from on this one? He's always been a great guitarist, but he now is a virtuoso. The CD is worth purchasing just to listen to his performance. I like it. I think it will be remembered at Grammy time. Definitely a must buy.     I've listened to the CD 20 times or so since receiving it, and my opinion remains the same, but strengthened. The production is top notch, and I believe this will be a CD mentioned by future musicians as a great influence. Frusciante's guitar playing, especially. I believe he will be mentioned by future guitarists much as Eddie Van Halen is by today's. Seriously, Frusciante is on an entirely different level since he did his flurry of solo CDs. He has tapped into his inner Hendrix---he's that good.     Flea is a different sort of bass player than he once was. I know he is just as technically proficient, if not more so, as he ever was, but he has hooked into a smooth jazz vibe for most of this CD. It works. There are still bass slapping funk riffs, but for the most part Flea is content to let Frusciante shine, and that's good.     Keidis is perplexing. Most singers get worse as they get older. He's getting better. He sings on key now, and ACTUALLY SINGS. Love it.     Chad Smith doesn't get the credit he deserves. He's a very good drummer, and holds his own in a band with two musical geniuses. He's funky.    Another reviewer, \\"dangitkimchee\\" claims tha the Mars CD won't load onto iTunes. This is not true in my experience. I had absolutely no problem getting either CD into iTunes. Perhps that reviewer has PC problems.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I must confess that I have not yet read the book, but watching this movie has persuaded me to.     Though some do not approve of this film version of the novel, I have to say that I understand them. I am not fond of period movies, so the idea of watching this film was far from my thoughts. One boring afternoon, with nothing else to do, I decided to view the film. I did not pay attention at first, but little by little, I began watching it. By the end, I was crying because of the last scene.    (Note: There are two endings to this film. The US version has Lizzie and Darcy kissing. The UK version ends with the intimate moment with Lizzie and her father. I cried at the UK ending.)    A few days later, I decided to watch the movie once more. This time, I enjoyed it more than I thought I would. So far, I've viewed the film 5 times and counting.    It is a masterpiece on its own. With its spectacular scenery, Colorful imagery, and moving score, one has to view this film more than twice to fully enjoy what this movie really has to offer. As I watched the film, I felt as if I was reading a piece of literature: fluid in motion as if from your own imagination.     The symbolisms in this film are abundant (Take note: The film aims to depict the film as if from the  POV of Lizzie. Notice the constant shoot where we are able to see what Lizzie sees, like viewing herself in the mirror or viewing Lydia's departure from the window.) Whats more is the set designers characterization of the settings to complement the characters living in them (Example: The Bennet house possessed vibrant colors similar to the Bennet family. Darcy's home gives a mysterious, great but modest grandeur similar to Darcy himself.) Then the Music... OH MY... the music is heavenly! Enough said.    The story flows quick and well. It does not drag in certain parts, allows full coverage of the main story without making the film too long.     I have viewed the BBC 1995 TV series of the novel upon recommendation mymany. For me, I did enjoy the TV version seeing as it seemed appropriate for television. But to be honest, I prefer this version better. One notable thing about this version is that you don't go hating any of the dislikable characters like Mrs Bennet, Mr Collins, etc. The film gives them depth and so in the end, instead of hating them totally, you tend to understand them.    The well-rounded characters, the breath-taking scenery, the emotionally moving score, and the vibrant colors of the imagery makes this film a work of art.    To add to this: as a guy, I did not expect to appreciate the intensity of the crucial romantic scenes, but I did. It surprised me but I was actually able to relate to Mr Darcy's character during those moments. I felt the moment.     The humor of the film is also something to behold. It takes careful attention in order to catch many of its humor (Such as Ms Bingley's line \\"For God's sake, Are we to receive every Bennet in the county?!\\" or Lizzie's reaction as she enters the room after reading Jane's letter about Kitty) Some jokes are not so obvious at first, but when you understand the situation, you laugh so hard. It's very witty and sarcastic.    The Acting... Keira being nominated for BEST ACTRESS at the Oscars says enough. Matthew is a great actor (Why wasn't he nominated?!). I've seen some of his work and I dare say that this is best work (For me that is). Playing a grown man who falls in love like a little boy is not an easy thing to do.    For those who dislike this film, may I ask you to take another look. For those who liked it, view it again so you would love it more.    As my Literature teacher once said \\"A good piece of literature is one which you have to read or view more than once in order to enjoy the various layers of the work\\". This is what this version offers.

0307276902|5.0|Presidents used to tell the truth 100% of the time, corporations never lied to investors and friends used to be so honest when it came to pnis size. What has happende to the world?, the apocolypse is truely upon us.    But seriously, my wife and I read this long before Frey showed up on Oprah. We liked it then as we still hold the same opinion now. Does anyone really believe everything in the Non-fiction section happened exactly as it is written down? I suppose these are the same individuals who believe -- it can't be in the newspaper if it isn't true -- welcome to the real world people.    Look, Fiction is always, in part, truth and non-fiction is always partialy false. People can't seem to get the fact that \\"truth\\" and \\"fiction\\" are intertwined beyond recognition for every aspect of life. If you don't believe me, then I'm sure you still find every reality TV show to be completely spontanious and unscripted. Get real. The only truth is that \\"Truth\\" is truly subjective (in all theoretical persuits, please don't throw a spoon at me -- unless I'm a massochist, then your pain would be my pleasure).
0739326740|5.0|Someone please explain to me why most people are making The Da Vinci Code a history book! It's a NOVEL, a STORY. It's hard to believe that anyone with even average intelligence can get so bent out of shape over a novel. I am a devout Christian and my mind can seperate fact from fiction. Now that I have that out of my system, I loved The Da Vinci Code. However, Angels and Demons will always be my 1st pick of Dan Brown's books.
1878424319|5.0|Don Miguel Ruiz, a physician turned Toltec Spiritual Guide teaches the reader about the 4 Agreements, that if made, will result in personal freedom and a life filled with joy and happiness. The 4 Agreements are: Be Impeccable With Your Word, Don't Take Anything Personally, Don't Make Assumptions and Always Do Your Best.  <br /> <br />The author elaborates on each of the 4 Agreements throughout the book and how to apply each to your life. My favorite section was \\"Be Impeccable With Your Word\\". Ruiz says, \\"whenever we hear an opinion and believe it, we make an agreement, and it becomes part of our belief system... These types of agreements are difficult to break. The only thing that can break a spell is to make a new agreement based on truth\\". Another helpful section was on \\"Always Do Your Best\\". Ruiz says, \\"The best way to say, 'I love you, God', is to live your life doing your best. The best way to say 'Thank you, God' is by letting go of the past and living in the present moment, right here and now. Whatever life takes away from you, let it go. When you surrender and let go of the past, you allow yourself to be fully alive in the moment\\".
B000005J56|5.0|This album is exceptional! I've listened to it many times and it just gets better and better. I cannot recommend this one enough! If you like Cuban music in the least bit, you've found a true gem, and even if you don't I guarantee you'll like it. It's one of the few cd's that works for anytime: parties, relaxing, car, anything. Your only regret will be that, if you are like me and are confined to english, you'll want to sing along! Look up the words to some of the slower ballads, they are lovely.  <br /> <br />Even better than this cd is the DVD which is absolutely fascinating- it gives such insight and nostalgia into the old days in Havana.
1400032717|5.0|This book has the power to place you in the mind of an autistic child with each page you turn.  After recommending it to everyone I know, I thought that a review would also be a way to get the message out there:  Read this book.   <br /> <br />The author leaves you speechless and unable to put down this story.  I was just swept into the little boy's journey, and felt like he did as he tried to make his way in a world that he saw so differently than so many of us do.   <br /> <br />It is hard to explain how powerful this book is to others who have not yet read it.  However, this is not a book to miss.  You will be amazed.
1400079179|1.0|Boy, was I disappointed with this book after all the hype around it. Its pulp-fiction, airport novel narrative plods along with a 1001 unlikely and unconvincing conspiracies. Its characters are generic and stereotyped. Its thematic base of a massive cover-up by the Catholic Church concerning \\"The Truth\\" as regards Jesus Christ grates endlessly due to the breathless but lecturing way it's presented. The book, while claiming to be based on historical fact, is actually full of endless silly codes, less than mysterious mysteries and historical inacurracies: are we really meant to believe that Jesus was just considered a man by all Christians until the Council of Nicea decided otherwise? Has Brown even bothered to read the Epistles or the book of Revelation? Even a casual acquaintance with the New Testament makes his book seem just silly - fiction or not. As for the climax - the soppy, new-agey \\"revelation\\" of what the Holy Grail really is (it's not actually anything; just another quasi-religious statement) - it was about as revealing and enlightening as the weekly shopping list. Honestly, I can't understand why this book has caused so much intrigue and fascination; Brown's ideas aren't even original for goodness' sake and his writing skills leave a heck of a lot to be desired.

6305313687|3.0|Racism and racist violence has rarely been portrayed as this ugly and stupid and kudos to the filmakers for deglamorizing racialist culture. American History X is the story of skinhead leader Derek Vinyard who is sent to prison for a racially motivated double homicide. During his stay in prison he has realizes the pointlessness of his racial hatred and belief system. When released he breaks with his virulent nazi past and attempts to extricate his younger brother from the mental clutches of racist philosophy/culture. The tale is stylishly shot and edited, perhaps too stylishly in its use of slow motion, lengthy black and white flashback scenes and dramatic musical score. A simpler approach would have helped the movie's sense of gritty reality and upped the emotional ante. The Hollywood production gloss can sometimes get in the way. Unfortunately its not just the production that is overdone. The film is often crudely melodramatic, and ham fisted when driving home its point. What is it's point? Well, American History X doesn't explore the origins of racism so much as it explores the pathology of racism, how it grows and spreads. It makes the assumption that racism is a learned behavior based in anger and then asks the question if racism is a learned behavior, could it then be unlearned? Which is an interesting point, but American History X's conclusions/assumptions are often too Hollywood pat and simplistic. The transformation of the central character from neo-nazi to moral thinking man is pivotal to the plot, but the circumstances surrounding his transformation are just not that believable, nor is his complete break with racism. Derek became a racist organizer in reponse to his bigoted fireman father's murder in a poor black neighborhood while fighting a fire. Which almost absolves him of some of the responsibiliy for his views. His anger at the death of his father is understandable even if his philosophy and subsequent actions are not forgivable. But Derek's allegiance to racial ideas is tenuous and more a reaction to the grief and anger he feels over his father's death and he's a VERY angry guy. The ultimate message the film seems to convey is not nescessarily that racism can be unlearned but that hatred is just too much work. If you choose to live with hatred and carry that baggage around, you and your loved ones will be affected by that hatred as evidenced by the violent and somewhat predictable end of the movie. As the Avery Brooks character asks Derek in prison: Has anything you've done in you life actually made it better? In Derek's case the answer is an obvious no. The seed of racism planted by his father and nurtured by Derek's hatred results in tragedy. Ultimately though the film is a bit too Hollywood and heavy handed, chosing to reach for easy emotional thrills, simple answers and consequences rather than to more fully explore its dark and complex subject matter. The movie can be at times VERY powerful, but true redemption is hard to come by.nce to racial ideas is tenuous and more a reaction to the grief and anger he feels over his father's death and he's a VERY angry guy.

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I love the A&E version and this one. It is shortend but very good. I am just finishing up the book. But before you see this movie i would watch the A&E first it helps you understand it more. But the acting was very good, the senery was beautiful, the costumes were really nice.
B000FL7CAK|5.0|Veronica Mars' sophomore season (and senior year) starts out with our heroine determined to return to a sense of \\"normalcy\\" after solving the murder of her best friend in season ones awesome finale.  <br /> <br />But just when she thought she was out, circumstances pull her back in to solving mysteries and dangerous dealings. First ex-boyfriend Logan is accused of murdering Felix, a PCH motorcycle gang member and then a bus load of high school kids is sent hurtling over a cliff by an exploding bomb.  <br /> <br />While who caused the bus crash and who really killed Felix are the season long mysteries, Veronica also finds herself embroiled in smaller cases brought to her by the students of Neptune High.  <br /> <br />This season found the series experiencing some growing pains as the tangled plot lines mounted up and the characters were shaded with a darker brush, but the writers were once again able to tie up all clues into a cohesive and shockingly satisfying finale.  <br /> <br />If you enjoy well written stories, strong character developement, clever dialogue, brilliant acting by pretty people and answers instead of more questions by the seasons end, this may be the show for you. <br /> <br />Oh. And the CW just announced Veronica Mars will be on their schedule for a season three. So watch season two before Veronica and crew head out to college in the fall! <br />
B000002J09|5.0|<br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  The band I chose is Led Zeppelin.  It is hard to discuss just one album, they all rock.  Sense I have to pick one it will have to be Led Zeppelin IV (aka ZOSO).  The music and sound of this band is distinct and when you hear one of their tunes you automatically know its Zeppelin.  This particular album rocks most heavily.  It is very reflective of the times at which it was born and relatable to its listeners.  Robert Plant has an unmistakable voice and singing style.   <br /> One song I like is track eight When The Levee Breaks.  Most Zeppelin songs deal with real subject matter that is sung in an obscure way.  Our lives revolve around one or two major things; in this song it is the levee.  The levee controls all.  When he thinks, how he lives and if he lives.  Another song I really like on this album is track five Misty Mountain Hop.  This is an upbeat tune that escapes reality yet again deals with what could really go on in life.  Palmer's high pitch vocals in addition to his trademark squeals and moans intensify the lyrics as well as the instrumentation the band is contributing.  <br />I am drawn to this band because of the ability to relate to the lyrics, I could be a character in one of their tunes.  Crazy subject matter that comes from left field is musically created in a way that is enormously attractive. Most notable the licks slapped out by Jimmy Page.  Jimmy Page is one of the best guitar players of the time. The combination of rock, rhythm and blues are concocted into a tasty musical margarita that keeps listeners intoxicated and thirsty for more. This album asks the listeners to reflect, celebrate and regret.  A full spectrum of life's minidramas are all played out.   <br /> In my opinion there is not a band that has a style like Zeppelin.  So I am going to go against my better judgment and say Areosmith.  I say this because this band has a rock foundation with a bluesy framework.  In addition Steve Tyler can belt out the vocals.  He also includes screams and squeals, as would be lyrics in these vocals. <br /> My second album...again hard to choose is Houses Of The Holy. <br />
B000E1ZBGS|2.0|Have you ever seen the \\"15 minute Hamlet\\"?  At the end, they find that they have some time left, so they do it again, but even faster.  That is this version of Pride and Prejudice. <br /> <br />I do not understand how so many people have rated this film 5 stars.  I tried to like it, I really did, but the entire story is rushed.  The actors seemed so involved in trying to enunciate the lines at speed (to varying degrees of success) that most other aspects of performance seem to have been left out.   <br /> <br />The only reasons this movie got even two stars: <br />   Camera work was very nice, as was the lighting and background music <br />   Scenery and costuming, excellent, espeically the marriage proposal scenes - almost (but not quite) worth watching the movie just for those scant minutes <br />   The dances were fantastic - blocking, cinematograpgy, sound, even the directing was a little better there  <br /> <br />Still annoyed about: <br />   Liz is supposed to be pretty, but not as pretty as her elder sister:  Keira Knightley has a nice face, but is the twig thin that is popular in Hollywood and is modern high fashion - in period she would have been completely unremarkable beyond skinny.   Even so, she is a good sight better looking than Jane. <br />   Dame Judy Dench as Lady Cathrine DeBurgh was the equivalent of lighting your charcoal grill with a gallon of lighter fluid and three sticks of dynamite.  Her screen presence and intensity put the already pale performances in an even worse light.    <br />   The hurried nature of this Cliff Notes version of the book ends up with mixed pacing.  The actors were all waiting hungrily to pounce on and devour their lines, leaving the audience both winded and bored. <br /> <br />In the end, the best I can say about this show is that it is much closer to the book than the black and white version, where they tried to combine Lizzie with Jo from Little Women, not to mention turning Lady Cathrine DeBurgh into a matchmaker.Oy. <br /> <br />Just go watch the BBC-Colin Firth version.  This may be shorter, but it's not worth the chunk of your life which could be spent watching the first disc of a better version.
0393324818|5.0|Michael Lewis really excels in Moneyball. The book is so much more than merely insight on the occupation of a baseball General Manager. It is a book about innovation and change. Taking the risk to challenge traditional practices in life and somehow come out successful.    It is very important to understand that this is not a biography of Oakland A's GM Billy Beane. Lewis simply uses him as the prime example of using change to be successful. All of the opinions slated in the book are of Lewis and not Beane. Many turned away from this read feeling that it was an egotistical portrait of Beane...they couldnt have been more wrong.    Basically, Lewis describes the business moves made by the A's at the start of the new millennium. They are a team with a stingy budget that somehow continues to make the playoffs over much more wealthy teams. The recepie to their success lies in using a new, statistical approach to finding and keeping low budget players. This is the primary message of the book.    However this is merely a parable telling us that change is paramount to succeeding. Beane, agaisnt much opposition, changes the way that teams can become successful. Similiarly, the modern business world must continually be apt to innovation to remain competitive as the world becomes more globalized.     This book is both a great summer read for your average baseball fan, yet it also is great for someone looking for some change in their life. Whether you want to read into the depth the book carries or just read about baseball, this is an excellent book.
0385504209|1.0|It took me a long time to get around to reading this book, mostly because I was so sick of hearing about it back when all the hoopla about the movie's release was going on. Then the movie (which I didn't see) completely tanked, so I forgot about the novel.<br /><br />But I was searching around for something new to read and came across this book and thought, \\"Oh! I remember this! A lot of people thought this was a fantastic read.\\" With all the hype surrounding it, I was absolutely certain that \\"The DaVinci Code\\" was going to be a page-turning thriller like no other.<br /><br />Oh, I was soooo wrong. There are more plot twists and turns and more clues uncovered in a Miss Marple mystery by Agatha Christie than there are in this ponderous tome. It started in a way that didn't immediately grab my interest, but I thought, \\"Okay, some books are slow starters,\\" but by the time I was halfway through, I was sort of beyond the slow-start excuse. When I read the last page, I closed the book and thought about all the things I could have been doing, like learning to weave baskets or make hooked rugs. All that precious time, wasted.<br /><br />It's not just that the plot is uninspiring, it's that so many things happen in a facile manner, like the problems that have stumped grail-seekers for the past millenium being solved by whatsizname and whatzername in one simple conversation. \\"Hmmm...let's think about that for a minute and whoooaaaaaaa! Eureka! We have solved it!\\" Then they'd get in the car and drive to wherever and triumphantly uncover the clue just moments ahead of a Bad Person Who Wanted to Stop Them. It went on like that through the whole book.<br /><br />And if you couldn't see that ending coming from about a hundred pages off, well, my gosh. The tying up of that last bit of plot into a great big ginormous bow was about as subtle as a punch to the face.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this book. I really expected it to have a tightly woven and ingenious plot, with well-developed characters that practically lived off the page. From all I'd heard, I thought it would be the thriller above all thrillers.<br /><br />I didn't.<br /><br />It didn't.<br /><br />It wasn't.<br /><br />Don't bother.ived off the page.

B000EULJLU|5.0|No two Tool LP's are alike. Having said that, 10,000 Days is no different. The band illustrates its ever evolving musical style. This album really must be listened to as an entire entity. From start to finish, Tool reminds you why they are one of the best metal bands of our era. <br /> <br />Taking a different road than previous albums, 10,000 Days greatness is found in its lyrics. The instrumental sound in this case plays a supportive role in the powerful message the album blares out. To attempt to explain and make sense of the deep lyrics of Keenan would be nearly impossible to explain, you must experience them for yourself in this case to discover the impact they possess. <br /> <br />In terms of the insturmentals, the album takes a slightly softer approach. However they still continue to create the sound that all Tool fans will know and love. From outlandish bass lines, concentrated guitar riffs, and an always impressive drum regiment, the band lays everything out on the table. <br /> <br />If you are looking for a musical epic to take you away from the mundane sound on the radio, pick up 10,000 Days. It is an album that can be greatly appreciated by musical buffs and Tool fans alike.
B0000C2IQD|4.0|In 1968, United Artists released the classic family-oriented musical Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. At the time, mixed reviews and poor box office returns could relegated it to obscurity. However, instead, over the years, despite a very cliched storyline, special effects about ten years behind the times, and songs that can't exactly hold their own with those from the major hits of the box office, the film has become a childhood classic thanks to the fact that it's a genuinely fun film. <br /> <br />Chitty's inagural DVD release in 1998 was a bland full-screen only release with practically no bonus features. In 2003, however, MGM finally decided to give Chitty her shining moment on the DVD shelf with a loaded 2-Disc Special Edition, just in time for her 35th Anniversary. <br /> <br />Disc 1 is a double-sided disc. Both sides are identical with the exception of the movie. Side 1 contains a 16x9 widescreen transfer, while side 2 contains a fullscreen transfer, which is sure to please both people like me who prefer widescreen as well as people who prefer fullscreen. Both brand new high-definition transfers have been restored and remastered and look better than ever, despite some occasional anomalies, such as flickering and shakiness/jumpiness, especially during the opening credits. The 5.1 digital soundtrack is also the best this film has ever sounded. <br /> <br />Disc 2 contains a nice selection of bonus materials. Two new featurettes are the main attraction. One is a new interview with Dick Van Dyke on the making of the film, while the other is about Chitty herself. Vintage featurettes, trailers (Including one from France!) and TV spots, games, and a good photo gallery are also included. However, the big surprise in this package would be 14 demos performed by Richard Sherman, with intros explaining the songs. Most of them are simply demos of songs that made it to the film, some with alternate lyrics. However, there are demos of two deleted songs which remain in the film asunderscore, as well as a deleted reprise of Lovely Lonely Man to be performed by Caratacus Potts. It's just a shame these demos weren't also included on the excellent CD soundtrack. I must take off a star, however, because I'm disappointed with the lack of real MEATY making-of materials, as opposed to JUST two fluffy documentaries and fluffy vintage featurettes. A good making-of with interviews with more of the surviving actors and the Sherman brothers would have been nice - something that also acknowledges the fact that the film was not as well recieved upon its initial release as it is today. An audio commentary also would have been a nice addition. <br /> <br />MGM did not skimp, however, on the quality of the packaging, something I felt Varese Sarabande did with the soundtrack. *No lyrics, only an essay.* Packaged inside a gorgeous slipcover that opens like a book to list the DVD materials and a map of the locations from the movie, a digipack opens up to display both discs and a gorgeous 34-page storybook overflowing with gorgeous pictures from the movie. <br /> <br />With all its flaws, I still wholeheartedly recommend this DVD for any Chitty fan simply for the gorgeous presentation of the film. If you own the original fullscreen DVD, throw it out and replace it with this excellent DVD presentation. You get your choice of widescreen and fullscreen presentations, a brand new high definition restored and remastered audio and video transfer, and a whole disc of bonus materials.
B00008OE4W|5.0|The movie SNEAKERS owes a great deal to the television show MISSION IMPOSSIBLE. In fact the movie, which follows an eclectic group of colorful characters pulling off some amazing missions, is something of a hybrid mix of MISSION IMPOSSIBLE, WARGAMES and James Bond with a splash of ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN thrown in for good measure.<br />Perhaps its only a coincidence then that the movie's star, Robert Redford was also the star of the 1970s story which detailed the shady underbelly of the federal government and the investigative work following the Watergate break-ins. And the parallels with WARGAMES are even more obvious since its writers (Lawrence Lasker and Walter F, Parkes) were also responsible for this effort.<br />Regardless, SNEAKERS gives is an exciting and fun, yes fun, look at the power of computers in today's age and what a danger that the technology can do in the wrong hands. The movie opens in the Dec. 1969 with two college kids hacking into Richard Nixon's bank account, one of them goes out to grab some Chinese and as he is getting into his vehicle sees his friend being arrested.<br />Fast forward two decades and we learn that the college hacker who had avoided the rap earlier has assumed a new identity and now goes under the title of Martin Bishop. He has joined a group that specialize in testing banks security systems and other such missions. Among the group is Sydney Poitier as former straight-laced CIA operative Donald Creese, Dan Aykroyd as the conspiracy-theory obsessed \\"Mother,\\" River Phoenix as the young hotshot \\"romantic\\" Carl Arbegast and David Stratham as the blind  Erwin \\"Whistler\\" Emory.<br />The group is contracted to get their hands on a chip that would allow computer users to hack into any network, something both the government's NSA and the criminal underworld want to get their hands on (so that the former cannot break into the latter's networks. Involved in this complex, but entertaining plot is Bishop's former friend Cosmo (Ben Kingsley) who went to work for the underworld after getting out of prison. The dramatic scenes between Redford and Kingsley are some of the best exchanges in the movie. In addition the exchanges between \\"Mother\\" and Creese provide for some humor as the former irritates the latter constantly with his ever more involved conspiracies. The dialogue really shines and the movie is easy to recommend.<br />The collector's edition may appear a little thin on special features today when 2-disc ultimate editions have become the norm, but it does serve up an interesting 39-minute \\"Making of...\\" documentary and a breezy, friendly scene specific commentary track.<br />The featurette includes a number of archival on-camera interviews with the stars including Robert Redford, Ben Kingsley, Dab Aykroyd and the late River Phoenix. It is among these interviews that we learn that the slides projected onto the wall behind the professor as he teaches cryptography theory were actually prepared by a real professor of cryptography. And that Aykroyd based his conspiracy theorist character on his brother (who apparently believes all number of conspiracies including that there has never been a picture taken of the North Pole.)<br />Understandably the three recount how stars flocked to their movie once Redford had signed on.<br />We also learn that the blind Whistler was based on a real-life blind sneaker who was imprisoned after creating a box that could replicate telephones touch-tones.<br />Director/Writer Phil Alden Robinson recounts the genesis of the story and how co-writers Lasker and Parkes came across the term \\"sneakers\\" while they were writing WARGAMES in 1981. Initially the term was a reference to the young programmers at IBM who come to work wearing sneakers. However, they learned at a computer convention in Chicago that the term also referred to groups who are hired to break into secure networks. Believing this to be a great basis for a movie the two (along with Robinson) began a 10-yearjourney (during which they managed to bring a dozen other movies to the screen) to put together the story. Initially the younger Redford and Kingsley characters were to have been responsible for a campus explosion but this was changed to hacking into Nixons account because the audience would have never gained sympathy for the Redford character in the original screenplay.<br />The three (Robinson, Parkes and Lasker) are obviously great friends as is evidenced by the scene-specific commentary. They talk about the characterization and there is good balance between technical and anecdotal remembrances. They recount how they received some erroneous criticism from Ebert who said they used up-to-the-date technology in the 1969 opener when in fact they went out of their way to use 1969-era computers as well as the producers search for a young looking Redford.<br />Trailers and recommendations round out the special features.to bring a dozen other movies to the screen) to put together the story.

B000002I97|5.0|If you are at all interested in contemporary folk music and its history, this is one of 3 or 4 disks that MUST be in your collection.   It is simply one of the most impressive debut albums ever released, in all of popular music. <br /> <br />John Hiatt interviewed Prine on a \\"Sessions at West 57th\\" episode.  It went something like this. <br /> <br />---------------- <br />Hiatt: Is it true you wrote your first three songs over a single weekend ?   ... what were they ? <br /> <br />Prine: Yes, it was to get ready for my first gig.   The songs were \\"Sam Stone\\", \\"Paradise\\", and \\"Hello in There.\\" <br /> <br />Hiatt (no slouch himself): Man, that's quite a weekend.   For a lot of people, that would be a great CAREER. <br />---------------- <br /> <br />Not only were these great songs when released.   Thirty years and hundreds of plays later, they can still give me shivers.    The depth and maturity of these songs coming from such a young songwriter was simply staggering.   ... and, as others have noted, there is not a single weak song on the album. <br /> <br />Prine has had an impressive career (in quality, if not quantity of sales), but no single album of his is as uniformly impressive as his debut.   Although his most recent, Fair and Square, may come close. <br /> <br />We're fortunate to still have Prine around after his bout of cancer.    Buy this album, the Great Days anthology, and Fair & Square.   Then check out Pollstar and go see him live when he's in your area.   You won't be disappointed.

0307277674|3.0|Mr. Brown isn't that great a writer. His spelling and grammar are atrocious. But what I did enjoy about this novel were the questions it raised: Exactly how much truth is in the Bible and how accurate is the current interpretation? It sent me on a spiritual journey, particularly regarding women's roles throughout history. And the BIG question it raised was what happened to bring about the shift in power from women to men? And what will it take for women to get it back again? If, for nothing else, this novel was well worth raising all the controversy. [...]

B00005JKES|5.0|It's amazing this show was able to air on television, network broadcast; the reason being it's so very good! When I think of network television... I think of empty. I think of disgusting television shows where people sit there for 30 minutes losing a piece of their intellect and soul. This show; is nothing but soul. And perhaps it has a soul of it's own.  <br /> <br />The characters are strange but believable; because they're mountain people. The FBI officer is very proper and enjoys the middle-of-nowhere town. The season finale, without giving anything away... has left me saying WHY IS SEASON 2 NOT ON DVD? That's just torture. SEASON 2 NOW! Because I really don't want to have to buy a VCR to watch Season 2; but it's definitely worth it (and I assure you that's what I will do if I have to wait more than 1 month!).

If you can understand french welll enough that the subtitles only just \\"help\\" you, then you will love it. <br /> <br />If you rely solely on the subtitles, it will be hit or miss depending on your threshold of comedy.   <br /> <br />Really, the subtitles are just not reflective of the spoken dialogue/comedy.  Ah, I'll make a recommendation: don't buy it.  And this is for a movie I rate 4.5 stars. Sad.

B0000TLA9G|3.0|Yes, this offers all the classic GN'R tracks - the loud, brutal rockers (Welcome to the Jungle, Paradise City, Live and Let Die, You Could Be Mine,  Yesterdays, with a killer video of Axl doing that cool slither-dance thing), the contemplative, sensitive-guy ballads (Patience, Sweet Child  o' Mine, November Rain, Don't Cry) and that one song that's a bit of both (Civil War). However, the execution here failed remarkably. I know the idea here was to round up the hit singles, but there are two key flaws in that setup: some of the group's best songs weren't singles (Mr. Brownstone, My Michelle, Night Train, the acoustic You're Crazy from GN'R Lies, Dust n' Bones, 14 Years, Estranged), and some really lousy ones were (Knockin' on Heaven's Door - what the hell is THAT?) And any collection that culls more from the clearly cut-rate Use Your Illusion II than the tier-one classic Appetite for Destruction has some serious problems - II had maybe 5 good songs (though those five are all MASTERPIECES - 'cept maybe 14 Years, which is still cool stuff), Appetite had 11 (of 12). The Spaghetti Incident tracks are the two best songs off that album, yes, but hey... that's not exactly what I'd call great. I think a two-disc GN'R comp (you know, one of tbose Essential GN'R things or something like that) could possibly rule and then some. But this is a servicable roundup of most (though not all - Mr. Brownstone and Estranged are ESSENTIAL RECORDINGS) of GN'Rs best songs.
B0000524CY|5.0|\\"The Exorcist\\", along with such movies as \\"Rosemary's Baby\\", \\"The Shining\\", and \\"The Ring\\" stand out to me as some of the greatest horror movies of all time.  Not only were they great movies in and of themselves, but they \\"broke the rules\\" and treaded new ground.  This DVD contains many deleted scenes and behind the scenes looks at the making of the movie. <br /> <br />I know I have heard that after a screening of the movie a few months before it was released, some screen executives thought that the movie should not be released.  It was just too scary.  When you truly watch the movie for the first time, you will truely be scared......if you take it in deeply enough.  Some people remember it for the \\"pea soup\\" incident, but this movie didn't use gore to make its point.  Like the other movies listed above, it used intelligent imagery, dialogue, and symbols to make its points. <br /> <br />Most people reading this review know that the story was based on a case in 1947 in which a 13-year old boy was supposed to be possessed.  Obviously some details were changed for the movie.  I would like to see a movie of the \\"true\\" story from 1947 made in which no names are reveiled but the facts of the case are given.  The Exorcist truly deserves all 5 stars. Maybe more writers and movie makers today ought to go back and watch it before they attempt to make another foolish teen movie that calls itself a horror film.
0030839939|4.0|For undergrads or grads who are majoring in solid state physics, there are often two common choices of texts. This one and one of Kittel's books. There are differences. Ashcroft & Mermin tends to have better diagrams, of reciprocal space and Fermi levels, for example. And overall, the topics are discussed at a slightly more advanced level.<br /><br />The biggest problem with Ashcroft and Mermin is that it surely is time for a new edition. Notably to include high temperature superconductors. Plus the quantum Hall effect. And maybe giant magnetoresistance. The latter is responsible for much of the advances in disk drive capacities in the 90s, for example.<br /><br />Another problem is the sheer cost of this book. $155 list price?! Sounds like gouging.
B000E1NWGY|4.0|Here is another successful SACD reincarnation of Romantic era music by Jascha Heifitz, who was probably the most accomplished violinist of the 20th century and the stereo recording era. These recordings, made in 1961-62 for RCA, are substantially improved in this issue even though it in only a two-track stereo super audio disk.<br /><br />I own these exact recordings on a Japanese issue stereo CD (see my Amazon review) where I detail the outstanding musical content including the ultra-reliable and superb accompniment given the soloist by conductor Malcolm Sargent and the (then) New Symphony Orchestra of London.<br /><br />Musically, what is most impressive on this CD is Heifitz's commitment to Bruch's oddball creation, the Scottish Fantasy, and his personal involvement in the music. Heifitz was often considered a machine in his prime, which coincided with the 20th century burgeoning of the era of literalism in classical music and recordings. Everyone admired Heifitz technical skill, which was one of a kind, but many questioned his blood and guts involvement with music.<br /><br />I saw and heard Heifitz in concert once near the end of his career. He seems totally disinterested although his technique and searing tone were just as riveting as ever. In the Scottish Fantasy on this disk, he seems a different person, totally immersed in the wonders of the strange score, which appears to be a concerto but is a hybrid not easily defined. His artistry here is unparalleled and it is not far different in Bruch's Violin Concerto No. 1.<br /><br />Heifitz is not as personally invovled in the Vieuxtemps masterpiece, although Sargent shines as the accompanist more than in the others. While Heifitz lacks the same fire as in the Bruch, listen to the way Sargent drives the orchestra during the long tutti late in the first movement between Heifitz soloes.<br /><br />The reason I gave this 4 1/2 stars instead of five is the sound quality on the Vieuxtemps, which is a notch below that in the two Bruch works. It is still good for a 1962 recording transferred to SACD but, considering it is stereo and not three channel, it remains a bit of a disappointment.<br /><br />Elsewhere the sound is spectacular and allows many felicitous touches of the score to be heard clearly that weren't apparent in the stereo version. Listen for gentle timpani strokes during the slow movement of the Bruch concerto, a gentle cimbal crash during the open of the Scottish Fantasy, and Heifitz thumping his bow at the end of the allegro.<br /><br />In addition, the sound stage for both Bruch works is very open, spacious and natural with Heifitz clearly defined off the conductor's right shoulder. The perspective is on stage, even better than first row, without being in your face or larger than life.<br /><br />Good notes about the music, Heifitz the man, the history of RCA Living Stereo and the SACD process liven this package and make it even more desirable. This is an excellent reissue of romantic warhorses by one of the world's most accomplished soloists, supported by a reliable conductor and orchestra in sound that is nearly competitive with original DSD recordings from 2006. For its list price of $11, this is outstanding value.in the two Bruch works.

006109594X|5.0|That was one of the best books I have read on modern submarine warfare and the story was also very good. The elimination of a US supercarrier by a single nuclear-tipped torpedo was presented in an exciting way, as was the hunting of the renegade submarine that followed. The episode of the British sub passing through the Bosporus Straights was absolutely marvellous and I wish Robinson had devoted some more pages to the hunting of the enemy sub, instead of discovering it by chance.
B000069CWE|4.0|Ok, let's get one thing straight: Linkin Park is not trying to be super-heavy or anything, they're just doing their thing. I like Linkin Park since I like scratching and turntables and stuff like that. But when I heard about who was on the album (Backyard Bangers,The Humble Brothers, Zion, Aceyalone, and tons more), I wasn't so sure that LP could blend its sound with more DJ/techno influences of each song. But, when I listened to it for the first time, I was amazed. They did a good job of refreshing each track and added some verses from the guests on each song. Some of the remixes were better than the original songs themselves. Even if you don't like a whole lot of techno and turntables in your music, I still recommend buying this.
0671027344|4.0|The Perks of Being a Wallflower, by Stephen Chbosky, is a stunning glimpse into the reality that is adolescence. As a high school freshman, Charlie, the narrator, chronicles his adventures, meanwhile exposing how much he develops during the course of his first nine months in high school. The story is uniquely structured in a series of letters, composed in the style of a diary from the narrator's perspective. By addressing the reader ambiguously as a friend, starting each letter off with \\"Dear friend,\\" Charlie clearly indicates that he trusts the reader and will confide in the reader. This aspect of the novel effectively instantly draws the reader in and gives you the sense of familiarity. Perhaps the most indicative part of the novel is the first page which starts off... <br />\\"August 25, 1991 <br />Dear friend, <br />I am writing to you because she said you listen and understand and didn't try to sleep with that person at that party even though you could have. Please don't try to figure out who she is because then you might figure out who I am, and I really don't want you to do that...I just need to know that someone out there listens and understands and doesn't try to sleep with people even if they could have. I need to know that these people exist.\\" <br /> <br />Chbosky's creative style of writing is surprisingly reminiscent of the writing associated with young people, while carrying gripping adult messages about rape, molestation, homosexuality, as well as drugs. Charlie, who is dependent on acceptance from others, is described as an emotional misfit who finds comfort and solace in an older group of teenagers who introduce him to the world of illegal drugs, alcohol, and sex despite his timid demeanor. He is described as an overwhelmingly shy and anxiety-ridden person who naturally blends into the background (hence the title), content with observing the idiosyncrasies that ravage the world he lives in. <br />Bottom line: The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a provocative coming-of-age novel, full of mature content intended for (young) adults. A quick, page-turning read. <br />
B000C65Z1G|1.0|This was truly about the worse movie ever!  The movie-makers need to know that we fully understand their simple view of the world:  America bad!  Business bad!

B00005JO20|5.0|Although Peter Jackson is known for big budget extravaganzas, this little art house film may be his finest work yet. It is a brilliant, albeit somewhat obvious, metaphor for American imperialism in the post-Cold War era.  <br /> <br />Jack Black plays a director who must first \\"fight him over there so we don't have to fight him over here.\\" He uses superior technology to dominate the brutal hairy dictator, then brings him before the world court of public opinion, hoping to bask in the limelight as a true hero.  <br /> <br />But what is this? The silly monkey doesn't appear to play along. The grand plan for quick victory is torn awry by the easily predicted blowback of a resentful captive.  <br /> <br />Jackson proves, however, that in the end it's not high ideals or fitting justice that wins out the day. The simple fact is that if you spray enough bullets into enough flesh, eventually they give up and die.  <br /> <br />Bravo, Mr. Jackson, for this roadmap out of the War on Terror. Bravo.

B00005JLEU|5.0|I thought it was a great film. The purpose of the animation was for the girl to be lost in a world she didn't know. Almost like the wizard of oz, where everyone was unfamiliar and different. and the main character is swept in another world. She was trying to get her way back home. <br /> <br />I disagree with the guy that said it doesn't make sense. It's suppose to be a fantasy, not real, so enjoy it as an adventure. That's the point and there are so much inside of it like how she triumphs over evil, has strength and will to survive.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|My words cannot properly give explanation to this amazing double-album. I have listened to it completely now about 6 times, and each listen brings new favorites and melodies sticking in my head. It's really too much for my mind to understand how these 28 songs are so good. I was worried that a double album would mean one good album's worth of songs with a ton of filler crap.<br /><br />Thankfully I couldn't be more wrong. It's hard to understand how these guys seemingly get better and better as musicians over the years. Pretty much for 20 years now, every new RHCP album becomes my favorite and this is no exception. These albums bleed integrity and genius and I feel privileged to hear them.<br /><br />These songs weave into beautiful sounds and powerful melodies. The one thing that absolutely blows me away is how these guys have become masters of melody and chorus. Simply genius and they get better and better at it with each passing album.<br /><br />The highlights for me are too numerous too mention, but I really enjoy any time John sings backup - his voice is transcendental. John and Flea are virtuosos on their guitars. Anthony has never sounded better, and Chad pounds the skins perfectly. Freaking amazing!<br /><br />I think I like MARS a bit better but really it might change any given day. These guys are insane talents, and each member brings their A game.<br /><br />Thankfully this band still makes music and we are all fortunate to be able to enjoy them. Their last tour absolutely blew me away and I can't wait to see them live again this year. This double-album is really so good it is mind numbing.

Snake is just about the coolest action hero around in what is the definitive Kurt Russell role.  The acting as a whole is very entertaining, and this has got a cast like no other film: Kurt Russell, Donald Pleasance, Isaac Hayes, Adrienne Barbeau, Ernest Borgnine, Harry Dean Stanton, Lee Van Cleef and so on.  It's not often that you'll come across a movie of this sort where every role of any consequence is played by someone you've heard of.  The appeal of this film comes substantially from the characters and acting, which is quite unusual for a film of this sort, and probably what makes it a cut above the competition, as it still works on the more traditional levels as well.  'Escape From New York' is actually surprisingly slow and moody, not nearly as action-oriented as you might anticipate, but it certainly never drags and is always a load of fun.  Technically speaking this film is pretty impressive considering when it was made and its moderate budget.  (7 mil, I'm told.)  As CGI becomes ever more common and senselessly elaborate this sorta classic, practical stuff just becomes more and more interesting.  Carpenter shot this in widescreen, as always, which gives the film an added level of finesse and class.  (Again, as always.)  Carpenter did the score here too, and it's simple and minimalistic but effective enough in its way and charmingly dated.  I particularly enjoy the opening theme, too bad it doesn't get repeated more.<br /><br />I haven't gotten around to checking out the stuff on this DVD, but the picture itself, which is the only thing that matters much to me anyway, seems excellent considering the age of the film.  The packaging itself is rather nice looking and classy, I think.<br /><br />Yeah, this is good stuff.  Carpenter's career has been pretty uneven, but this film along with 'Halloween' and 'The Thing' earn him his substantial reputation. (Well, his substantial reputation amongst genre movie fans, anway.) Check it out.<br /><br />Grade: A-rn him his substantial reputation. (Well, his substantial reputation amongst genre movie fans, anway.) Check it out.    Grade: A-
B000EULJLU|5.0|As previous posters have made light of, \\"Wings for Marie\\" 1 & 2 can clearly be seen as a songset about Maynard's mom's passing in the cruel wake of a stroke.   <br /> <br />But these lyrics, intended or not, run awfully parallel to the recently publicized questioning of the role of Mary Magdalene in the history of Christianity... between the name \\"Marie\\" and the description of her long-overdue \\"ascent,\\" these lyrics could just as easily describe (for lack of a better example) the ideas put forth in Dan Brown's \\"The Da Vinci Code.\\"  Once again, I doubt this was the prime intention of Keenan while writing the record... I just think it's interesting.   <br /> <br />\\"10,000 Days,\\" as other posters have testified, is very Tool :)  The melodic/harmonic information in their music, at least for the last 10 years, was never very intense and hasn't changed much at that... but that's not really the main draw with Tool anyway, 'surprised to hear so many people are disappointed with this... they've always gone with 'winning' melodies over mind-benders.   <br /> <br />As long as rock bands play \\"songs\\" (and I use this term loosely with Tool), the balance of the situation will always be defined by how well all other elements support the storyteller (Keenan) and his stories... without signifcant attention to this balance, most known rock bands could not have become successful; this album, like all Tool, is one that speaks very clearly and invites you in, rather than shouting out to you.   <br /> <br />To me, Tool has not stopped \\"effing\\" with the core gestures (grooves) of rock music since their inception, and for this I will always salute them.  They always find ways to crack you in the skull with their rhythmic language, but in an extremely familiar way; this album is no exception.  Polymeters, unified technical playing, extreme patience, discretion and craftsmanship... all in support of an excellent singer/lyricist... A+
B000E8NRR6|3.0|The jury is still out with this one for me.  The recording sounds like any other Steely Dan/Fagen CD - great.  But I think the songs are a little tooooo long.  Maybe that is where I find the negativity for me.  I put a few songs on my IPOD, but will wait until I add the rest.  Gave it 3 stars because I liked his previous solo work & I have the Steely Dan box set.
0800177177|1.0|This movie is horrible.  This is one of my favorite books and FFC ruined it. The whole ruination comes from the \\"love story.\\"  Dracula is an evil presence who feeds off of innocence or innocents (whichever you prefer), not a doomed lover. I say shame on FFC for adding a subplot that does not belong. I wish I could give it zero stars.
B000E994KE|4.0|I Have To Say That This Album Is An Awesome One. Though Different From The Days With Pasi Koskinen, Tom Jousten Was A Good Choice To Front Amorphis. The Album Kind Of Reminds Me Of A Kind Of Gothic Metal Than Progressive Metal Though. Joustens Voice Is Nothing Like Pasi's At All. He Has This Dark, Deep Gothic Voice But It Mixes Well With The Music. So I Give It 4 Stars For Presentation And negative one star for The Change In Sound. All In All A Great Record...
B000E41MS6|5.0|First off I will start by saying that I have seen every Dr Who movie or show written and have been a fan for some 30 years. I loved Tom Baker as the 4th Doctor and always thought that he was the best. <br /> <br />Now the BBC releases the new Doc tor Who series and all I can say is Incredible! They have taken a very well done series and made it even better! <br /> <br />That is why the previous critic who says that this new series has terrible writing is so perplexing to me. Christopher Eccleston is by far the best Doctor the series has ever had! He is witty and clever in his performance and incorporates almost every trait from every previous Doctor!  <br /> <br />Too bad Christopher Eccleston left the series after 13 episodes! He is much better than David Tennant. <br />

B000053W5D|5.0|The enormously talented Emma Thompson wrote the marvelous screenplay for this brilliant adaptation of Jane Austen's novel of the same name. Ms. Thompson rightly won a Academy Award for Best Screenplay for her efforts. The film itself, first class in every respect, received seven Academy Award nominations and was named Golden Globe Best Picture of the Year.<br /><br />The film revolves around the two Dashwood sisters, the passionate and highly impetuous Marianne (Kate Winslet) and the more conformist and restrained Elinor (Emma Thompson), who have had a sudden reversal of fortune, having been left impoverished upon the death of their father. Their financial condition is exacerbated by the evil machinations of their sister in law, Fanny Dashwood (Harriet Walter), who manipulates her husband, their half brother, into pinching pennies with them, causing them no end of hardship.<br /><br />This nineteenth century tale of morals and manners details the romantic trials and tribulations of the Dashwood sisters. Marianne falls in love with a scoundrel, John Willoughby (Greg Wise), who leaves her high and dry for a woman with a fortune. Meanwhile, the kind and courteous Col. Brandon (Alan Rickman) falls in love with Marianne and suffers from unrequited love for some time, until Marianne regains her senses. Elinor falls in love with Edwards Ferrars (Hugh Grant), her evil sister in law's brother, and he with her, but many obstacles to their pairing are interposed along the way. All comes out right in the end, however, but it is the getting there that makes this film a must see.<br /><br />A witty, funny, and romantic film, it boasts a first class ensemble cast. While Ms. Thompson may be a bit long in the tooth for the role which she plays, her thespian talents and charm enable her to pull the proverbial rabbit out of the hat. Beautifully directed by Ang Lee, this film should top the list of those who love Jane Austen and those who adore superlative period pieces.
B00003CXIP|5.0|Stand By Me has to be the best film by actor/director Rob Reiner. What a supporting cast, full of young talented actors way back in good old 1986, Wil Wheaton, a very plump Jerry O'Connell, Corey Feldman, and the late River Pheonix. Pheonix carries this coming of age story the whole way through the film. Well at least his younger brother Joaquin has his talent as well, what a wonderful actor River was. Sweet, moving, and sometimes funny film. I have seen this film over 50 times, it still gets to me everytime. Look out for Richard Dreyfuss and Keifer Sutherland, they pop up in the movie too. Stand By Me is a ptich-perfect film, I highly recommend it to young teenagers, great friendship film, a true winner!

B000EULJLU|3.0|I *TOTALLY* agree 100% with the review of this new album from  \\"andreaabs\\". But I feel it only deserves 3 stars. I, too, was expecting better. I was SO impatient waiting for this cd to arrive in the mail hoping for new AWESOME Tool. It arrived one day after it was released and I was so excited!  <br /> <br />I have trouble hearing the words in the songs. I think the cd is more about the music, this time, which I found disappointing, because I *LOVE* Tool lyrics and trying to figure out what is meant.  <br /> <br />There's a chance that with a few more listenings, the cd will grow on me, and I'll know the whole thing, but at this point (probably have listened to it about 3 times) I'm not sure how much listening-to this cd will get.  Aenima *STILL* is cranked up regularly.  In MY opinion their best album is Aenima -  by far. Then I think Lateralus & Undertow tie as my second favorite(s).  <br />
0385513755|5.0|I read the paperback version of the Da Vinci code because I wasn't sure if I would like it so I didn't want to spend the money on a larger edition.I loved it so I decided to get this edition so that i could see the things I was reading about.This edition is WONDERFUL.I love seeing the paintings and the buildings as they are being talked about. The print in this edition is large enough to read without straining and the volume is big enough that they can put the picture beside the text that is talking about it.This book is great.If you like the basic editions of the book get this one.It is very enjoyable.
B000301YY8|5.0|I've read some of the other reviews, about the fact that James Blunt's voice requires some time to get used to, or that his lyrics are corny.<br /><br />Totally disagree. I heard the song \\"You're beautiful\\" on the radio once and that was enough to make me fall in love hard with this new artist (I mean his music). He's the best new thing out there right now, because his music and his lyrics are simple and honest. They ring true. And yes love or stories of break up, or even war for that matter, can be seen as corny, because it's so clich. But that's what life is about. Nobody is reinventing anything here, but the way he sings about them is just magical.<br /><br />This is the kind of CD I had to, HAD TO, get right away, and I had to go to a few different stores to find it. Listened to it right away, and liked all the tracks. Wish there were more (only 10).<br /><br />He has a certain something in his voice that is both fragile and strong and his songs are not overproduced with tons of arrangements that drown out their beauty. Frankly, he could sing a capella on most of them and they would be just as beautiful. Would love to see him perform live.

B00009Y3L4|5.0|What can you say about a movie classic? The winner of 8 Academy Awards,\\"Cabaret\\" is one of the great movies of the 1970's. It came out of a short golden period of film making, which brought about movie classics such as \\"American Graffiti\\", \\"The Godfather\\", \\"Jaws\\", \\"Annie Hall\\", \\"All the President's Men\\"\\", \\"Star Wars\\" and many more. To boot, it was a great musical, which came out in a decade, where the movie musical was considered all but dead. The film (based on Christopher Isherwood's \\"Berlin Stories\\") takes place in early 1930's, Berlin. We meet newly arrived, Brian Roberts (Michael York), a young British academic from Cambridge, who is going to get by giving English lessons to Germans. He meets his boarding house neighbor, a young, vivacious, American woman named, Sally Bowles (Liza Minelli). She's a singer/dancer/entertainer and party girl, who works at the \\"devinely, dacadent\\", Cabaret known as the Kit-Kat Club. We follow these two expatriates as they start out as friends and eventually become lovers. We meet their various friends and acquaintances. This includes a wealthy Baron, who seems to take a very close (and sexual) interest in the couple. We also follow the story of a poor, German businesman, who falls in love with a wealthy Jewish heiress. These soap operish plotlines, all takes place against the backdrop of European history as we watch the rise of Germany's Nazi Party and the German population's political/social turn towards fascism. The characters drink, party and partake in their sexual indescetions to try and blot out the terrible events, that are happening all around. This is episodically punctuated by surrealistic, ribald, musical numbers (that act as commentary or a Greek chourus) put on by the Kit-Kat Club's clownish, 'Master of Ceromonies' (Joel Grey) and his cast of performers. Every once in awhile a film comes along, where everything just comes together perfectly. This is one of those films. All the performers, artists and technicians are at the very top of their career game. This includes the brilliant direction from Bob Fosse. The powerhouse acting, singing and dancing from performers Liza Minnelli and Joel Grey. The wonderful  performances from actors Michael York, Helmut Griem, Fritz Wepper and Marisa Bereson. Also there are the marvelous, classic tunes (\\"Cabaret\\",\\"Maybe This Time\\",\\"Money Money\\" ETC.) from the songwriting team of John Kander & Fred Ebb, which will stick in your head forever. The sets, costume design, make-up, cinematography just work so well in transporting the viewer into another world. The DVD itself leaves alot to be desired. The sound is O.K., but the film's picture remastering is pretty bad. In the 'Extras department you get an interesting but short, 'Making-Of' documentary and both current and archival interviews with the film's paticipants. This is one movie that is ready for the 'Deluxe' DVD box treatment. \\"Cabaret\\" is a wonderful classic film and work of cinematic art, which will both entertain and move most movie fans!

1400079179|5.0|This book was great from beginning to end.  I could not put it down.  The author is a master at writing.  I would definitely recommend this book, it is a must read.
0399213015|5.0|This was a wonderful story. The book was very appropriate for young readers because the story was very understandable. The text and illustrations were very simple which is appealing to children. There were only a few words on the pages that help to keep the attention of young children when reading aloud. The illustrations both in the story and on the cover of the book expressed the theme of the book, nature. The illustrations were humorous, children can interact with them and the illustrations went very well with the text. It made the story real and children are able to see and understand how the caterpillar feels in the story. The text is packed with lots of information as is other work by Carle. This text is similar to other books with the same theme or subject because it teaches children about, metamorphosis, nature, counting, days of the week and sequencing. Most of the authors' work teach concepts, conventions, relationships, and allow student to interact with the text The books are all filled with humor, very colorful and have bold illustrations which make the books similar.  Reviewers feel that this book is outstanding. Excellent for young children to engage in whether they try to read it or if it's read to them aloud. I must agree with reviewers, the understanding of the book and the exciting and bold colors used in the illustrations are creative and great. This book will indeed make a contribution to the growing body of children's Literature. This book will remain one of the top recommended and will last a lifetime.
0385720920|5.0|Protagonist Victor Mancini leads a disturbing life. Victor is a medical school dropout who is starved for sympathy. He works in an 18th century theme park during the day, but spends his nights purposely choking on food to create heroes out of ordinary people, caring for his mother who is stricken with Alzheimer's, and fulfilling his sexual addiction. Through Palahniuk's vividly depictive diction, I felt I was constantly peering over Mancini's shoulder during his journey. While initially Palahniuk's diction comes across as overkill, it is what keeps one from putting \\"Choke\\" down. <br /> <br /> <br /> Throughout \\"Choke,\\" one constantly sympathizes with Victor because of his pathetic situation. This sympathy is mostly evoked in his flashbacks to his childhood, which seem abrupt at times, however they consistently inform readers of how Victor winds up in his current situation. Palahniuk's sexually explicit scenes are the only time Victor seems to be \\"enjoying\\" himself however they only further deteriorate his character. While Palahniuk's diction may cause these be slightly overbearing, it's what enables \\"Choke\\" to be a fairly fast read.  The only flaw I found in this book was Palahniuk's lack of development of his minor characters. However, with static minor characters, this brings all of the focus to Mancini and makes his flaws and actions all the more drastic. This novel may be too much for some readers, however because it is saturated with controversy, many will enjoy Palahniuk's \\"Choke\\" from start to finish.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Tool is back!!!!! 10,000 Days can keep you fascinated 10,000 Days , delicious instrumental structures all covered with complicated but appealing string constructions, the sometimes nervous, relaxed, histerical Maynard vocals that in moments flirts with anguish and then with madness, bass sections so variated and drums/percussions that take you to the highest levels that only a progressive/heavy band such as Tool can take you, Tool have been considered by many critics the King Crimsons bastard son and theres no doubt they most be their major influence, Tool tracks never last less than five minutes with the exception of some intros or sound effects that transport you from track to track and this is so remarkably from this band , every song is a travel thru variated changes of structures and atmospheres, check out \\"jambi\\", \\"the pot\\" \\"10,000 days\\" and \\"intension\\" every track is a journey that as soon its over you want to ride again. <br /> <br />HM
1400031362|3.0|I still find this series refreshing for its unusual setting, positive portrayal of Africa, and careful treatment of the relationships between the characters. But in this installment, plot (always a secondary consideration) takes a seat in the way-back of the tiny white van.  <br /> <br />The various plots involve a few detective cases, Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni's deep depression, the two orphans living at Mma Ramotswe's house, and money troubles at both the garage and the agency. You would think that with all this going on, there would be plenty of material to fill up a short book without the characters (and the author) also indulging in extended mental rambles. Much of the book struck me as weak philosophical musings in the guise of character development.
B000000OSE|4.0|This is a pretty good album, I like it. It's not as good as Greatest Hits, or even Appetite For Destruction but it's pretty good. The lyrics may not be so great but it's got some really good songs. Dust N' Bones, Live and Let Die, and November Rain would be the good songs on this album. Don't Cry isnt bad at all it's a beautiful ballad but can get boring after 3 minutes. I'll rate this 4 stars because it is kind of lousy with bad words. <br />It's cool man, <br />Whirligig.
0385720920|5.0|\\"If you're going to read this, don't bother... Save yourself.\\" The first few lines of Chuck Palahniuk's Choke basically sum up the point of this far from boring novel. If you've read Fight Club  or seen it, you know what I'm talking about. And if you didn't know \\"Fight Club\\" is really Fight Club... now you do. Victor Mancini is a medical school dropout in his mid-20s. His mother, Ida Mancini, is a hospital patient near death. Victor is an interesting character with what he sees as a dull life-he is a sex addict who works at a \\"live museum\\" during the day and he is a choker come nighttime. That is, Victor goes to a new restaurant almost every night, chokes on his food, and essentially makes a profit off of his near-death experiences. Chuck Palahniuk's Choke is a must-read if you want to be \\"saved\\" from a world of sleep-provoking novels. <br /> Every couple of chapters, Mancini reflects on his loveless childhood and crazy mother. Ida Mancini was some sort of political activist in her youth and Victor has a slew of stories about the insane schemes she conjures up. Victor talks about the time his mother hijacked a school bus and took him far, far away. Yes, THAT is how crazy she is. Mancini starts out early in the novel degrading himself and his \\"sorry\\" life as a perverted museum employee. Victor's character slowly but surely adjusts as Palahniuk's story unfolds. And boy does it unfold. Every day of Victor's life contains a story or two to tell, which leads to the surprising ending of the novel. Palahniuk keeps you turning the pages in hopes of finding out the ending faster.  <br /> The complexities of Victor Mancini are not evident at first when reading the book. Honestly, he seems like a sick and strange guy at first. However as the novel progresses and with the help of the minor characters such as Denny, Paige, and his mother, Victor changes. As he learns more about his past and wonders more about his future, Victor attempts to change his life. Through friendship, love, self- awareness, and help, Mancini attempts to be a different man. To view his life from a different angle. Does this attempt fail or succeed? Well, that's not for me to give away.  <br /> It takes one moment for a person to say they'll change, but many more moments to actually do it. After that first point, things just start to happen. That is how it goes for Victor Mancini. By visiting the past and contemplating about the present, he formulates his future. If you're looking for a jaw-dropping ending that keeps you thinking-Choke has got it. \\"The term \\"powder keg\\" pretty much nails it.\\"
B00005JOYC|5.0|Silent Hill is one of the few films that keep you thinking about them. I like it - if not love it - because there is not that usual splatter theme in it. The movie works on more than one layer and it plays with your emotions. Imagine the horror you begin to feel, being trapped in a place that's completely cut off the *normal* (say familiar) world, searching for a lost beloved one. Suddenly it gets black, not dark, black. Strange, terrifying, deadly creatures are after you. The only *safe* place, some kind of church, turns out to be the opposite.  <br />I felt constantly growing fear when I watched the movie, an emotional fear that squeezed my heart. I felt pity for the girl Alessa, and I cried for Cybil.  <br />I think, everyone who saw the film and liked it was on the same emotional level. People who tell that it was bad, didn't understand, simply because they are on a different emotional level. That's just my two cents. <br />Christophe Gans did a wonderful job, cast and crew were wisely chosen - yes, I mean it! - the atmosphere was intense and sometimes really sad and touching. I'm looking forward to the dvd, hopefully with many many extras. <br />Go and see it - Welcome to Silent Hill ... it'll change your thoughts.

B000EDWKXS|3.0|MOVIE: Con Air, an incredibly loud and in your face action movie that does what it sets out to do. Recently Disney has released a bunch of Jerry Bruckheimer produced \\"unrated\\" DVD's. Con Air was re-released with Crimson Tide and Enemy Of The State. This so called \\"unrated\\" edition is nothing but a marketing ploy, but we did need new editions of these Bruckheimer action extravaganzas. Con Air, directed by Simon West, is a flick about a man who is sent to prison after accidentally killing a man during a bar brawl. The opening scene and credits are set to a montage of Cage writing letters to his daughter that was born while he was in prison, and she writes back. So basically it's a narrated reading of the letters back and forth. Okay, we got the character development out of the way in about five minutes, now time for the action. Cameron Poe (Cage) is put on a plane to be sent back home, but he is transported with other hardened criminals. Cyrus The Virus (John Malkovich) has other plans though, and he stages a takeover of the plane. Let the mindless but fun action ensue. Nicolas Cage sports a bad southern accent, long hair, and pumped up biceps and is our protagonist. The movie has some bad dialogue and some cliched scenes, but it never takes itself seriously. We also get Mark Mancina and Trevor Rabin's full blown action score. Mancina and Rabin are members of Hans Zimmer's studio at Media Ventures, and Bruckheimer almost exclusively uses Zimmer or one of the composers that collaborate with him. The score is all electronic based, but it suits the movie well. As for the \\"unrated\\" material, there is basically nothing. The original running time was 115 minutes, so that makes 7 minutes of added footage. There really isn't anything more in terms of violence and action, just some awkward dialogue scenes that didn't really fit. So, yes, in a way the added footage hinders the movie if that's possible.<br /><br />ACTING: The movie also has a topnotch cast. Nicolas Cage, who is a favorite when it comes to Jerry Bruckheimer, is great as Cameron Poe the simple southern boy. John Malkovich steals the show as the movie's antagonist. He plays a serial killer yet adds class to the character. John Cusack plays the good cop who is back on the ground trying to handle the situation and believes that Poe is a good guy. So, you see the characters are pretty much cardboard cutouts, but they work. We have some great support from Ving Rhames, Steve Buscemi, and good ol' Dave Chappelle.<br /><br />VIDEO: The original release came with a non-anamorphic transfer, which is why this release is appreciated. This release comes with an anamorphic 2.35:1 transfer. The picture is sharp, no signs of any major flaws.<br /><br />AUDIO:The sound mix isn't the best, it's pretty much the same thing from the old disc, a basic 5.1 Dolby Digital track. It's not as spread out as I'd like it to be, but it's okay.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES: None. When you have no special features, that's a sign that this DVD's only purpose is to sucker in losers like myself into buying them. Oh well, I enjoyed it and don't mind double dipping for a better transfer.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:  They should have just thrown in a featurette or something to at least show some effort was put into it. I feel a little cheated that there is absolutely nothing on this set, especially since the added footage is pretty much crud. For those who don't own it, get this edition. However, if you do own it then don't double dip unless you really liked the movie or if you have a widescreen set that would benefit from the anamorphic transfer. Con Air is your typical mid 90's Bruckheimer actionfest. Nothing here to intrigue your mind, just entertain it.te when it comes to Jerry Bruckheimer, is great as Cameron Poe the simple southern boy.

B000002ADT|5.0|I haven't listened to this album for months. The last time I listened to it was sitting in my house with my good lady and my boy playing cards and drinking wine. Tonight I sat in my lounge with my good lady and my boy drinking wine and have now collapsed in a fit of ecstasy listening to this gem of mid-20th century art. There are times when one can get hung up on the formalities of daily existence, such as paying the bills via a day job or, simply getting up in the morning to pay those bills. I opt for the third option, which is listening to one of the finest six-pieces ever put together and being late for work! I'm thinking at this present point in time of having to turn the cd player off, be responsible and get enough sleep to survive a day working my ass off. I'm thinking what the hell, let's throw a sickie and have the day off and listen to this album all day tomorrow!
0440236304|2.0|This is Burgett's personal account in Operation Overlord. I have the greatest respect for what Screaming eagles did in Normandy, but Burgett is a prima donna and it shows!
B000EMGAOY|3.0|There's nothing particularly poor about this album, the songs are well written and nice to listen to, but it does lack punch. Obviously my interpretation of 'punch' is subjective and it is down to a stylistic leaning of mine, and i can undestand them losing their zest - they're getting on! But IMHO - all their early albums were explosive (albeit unrefined), Blood Sugar was one of the best albums ever made, One Hot Minute was also incredible (vastly underrated), Californication onwards kept that refined sound they gained from BSSM, but lost the passion of their early albums. The crossover period was two albums long. Now, their songs sound too composed, too produced, too polished, not enough of the raw jam energy that i felt was present before is today. I understand their musical choice, but it's a shame money fame and age combine to make a band lose their edge as it has in this instance.
1573301183|5.0|The title of this review, of course, is to reference the messsage bassist Sean Kinney wrote to four patrons of their MTV Unplugged set, Metallica. That is one of the many highlights, humorous and saddening,that you will find on this DVD. Of course, as mentioned may times over, the obvious fact is the deterioration of Layne Staley. The man was clearly on his last legs; the power and conviction in his voice is all but gone, and what is left is essentially a mouse-like figure, trembling and quivering his own shame and sorrow. Perhaps, at least for this performance,is for the best; the changes underscore the gravity and moxy that this band once had. \\"Would\\", \\"Down In A Hole\\" \\"Rooster\\" and \\"Killer Is Me\\" are some of the better performances that are featured is this must-own DVD.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|Pearl Jam returns to true form. I have been a fan from day one. Even though I may have disagreed with the direction they chose on a few of there previous releases. This effort has a raw and emotional sound to it. True talent always has a way of showing itself. I am very sure that this recording will go down as one of the best rock albums of 2006. It may not sell the most copies, but that is not important. What is important is the fact that Pearl Jam has chose to do what they want when they want when it comes to creating music. And yes they can still write and play music on a grand scale.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|Pearl Jam is an amazing band. 15 years into it and their are still churning out material that sounds fresh and exciting. For people who want a new Ten or Vs. put those in your cd player and enjoy, because you won't get Ten or Vs. here. Those albums are the past, and Pearl Jam takes what they have learned from each album of their career and applies that to this disk right here. The album isn't perfect, but I nevr wanted it to be. All I wanted was a new album full of Pearl Jam songs that represent where they are in their lives, and I got that album. Riot Act was amazing, Yield was amazing, Binaural was great, even Lost Dogs was a treat, so I have never lost faith in PJ. All of you people who haven't paid attention to Pearl Jam since 1994 should be ashamed of yourselves, you have missed some amazing work. <br /> <br />Go out and buy this album. You will be very pleased.
B00000IL1K|5.0|This album speaks of the soul of Sarah Brightman. She has a soul like no other. Her albums tend to come in themes and Eden's theme is hauntingly beautiful. Sarah's best songs on Eden are Eden, Dust in the Wind, and Anytime, Anywhere. Buy Eden. You will not be disappointed.
B000002BYD|5.0|This is an amazing album. For everyone considering buying this album, go do it now, you will not be disappointed!!!! I think this album is their 2nd best, 2nd after Riot Act. Both are amazing albums, and the only real Pearl Jam albums anyone needs. Go out and get this one now!!!!!!
B000EJ9MTW|4.0|The best new, 'classic' metal sound since Velvet Revolver came out with their debut album Contraband in 2004. These young guys from Australia know their way around a riff or two. Although you can't help but hear a bit of Sabbath, Zeppelin, Purple and White Stripes in their songs, the overall quality is quite good. <br /> <br />Favourite Songs include \\"White Unicorn\\", \\"Where Eagles Have Been\\", \\"The Joker and the Thief\\", \\"Pyramid\\" \\"Tales\\" and the two singles \\"Woman\\" and \\"Dimension\\". If you love classic rock, you will find enough to love about Wolfmother.
B00006M183|5.0|This is by far my favorite Pearl Jam album. To tell you the truth, this is my favorite album of all time besides the Beatles White Album. Maybe it is just me, but everything just hit so hard on this album, everything sounded like they wrote it for me, and me alone. The lyrics, are like words from my own brain, and the song structures are perfect. I was an average Pearl Jam fan until this album came along. \\"I am Mine\\" brought me in, and the rest of the songs on this album took over... Fan's of Pearl Jam's earlier work (Ten, Vs. Vitalogy) don't seem to care for Pearl Jam's later stuff, but to tell you my honest opinion, Pearl Jam went from an average arena rock band in grunger clothing, to a band that makes music that appeals to them, without caring what the rest of the world thinks... <br /> <br />If you are contemplating purchasing this cd, go for it, it is amazing.
B000065VA1|5.0|SO proved to be Gabriel's commercial breakthrough, but the fascinating thing about this CD is that it also stays true to the artist's unique vision. Each song touches on the depth of emotion that Gabriel never seems to be afraid to plumb; from the haunting duet with Kate Bush on \\"Don't Give Up,\\" to the ridiculous figure who is intent on making it, in \\"Big Time,\\" Gabriel never loses sight of his own vision. Each song works on its own merit; collectively this is just about perfect. \\"In Your Eyes\\" alone is worth the purchase. There are some who were afraid that Gabriel might have been \\"going commercial.\\" (Just listen to the last two cuts and you realize the experimental side of Gabriel is never far from the front.) It just seems to me that on SO, the rest of the world caught up.
B0000DYJM6|5.0|I gave it 5 stars because it's the best B-sides album I have ever heard. Music wise it is around 4 stars, especially considering the level of amazingness Pearl Jam records have. My favorite song on here is Let Me Sleep (It's Christmas). Rad stuff. Very worth the money, considering it is 30 songs worth of material for the price of a regular disk. <br /> <br />If you are a fan of Pearl Jam, get this, if you are looking to get into Pearl Jam, go buy their latest self titled work, or go out and get Riot Act...
B000ETQRCM|3.0|I am a huge PJ fan and own every CD they've made.  I was so excited to get this new CD based on all the reviews I had read.  Unfortunately, for me, you may as well group this one in with the rest of their recent mediocre releases.  There are a couple of good songs - probably the ones you'll hear on the radio, but the rest are quite forgettable.  Every time they release a new CD, it just reminds me of how good Ten is.
B0001D0FTW|3.0|IMO, Edguy were one of the better German power metal bands during the 1990s. After an inconspicuous beginning, they released 2 stellar albums (Vain Glory Opera & Theater of Salvation) that were truly worthy of carrying on the legacy established by their countrymen Helloween, Blind Guardian, Stormwitch, Runing Wild, etc. At the dawn of the century, EDGUY were setting the standard for traditional Euro power metal. Since then, however, they've written themselves into a rut with two decent, but not great, albums, Mandrake & Hellfire Club. Neither album is bad, but they both lack that extra edge that made VGO and ToS so incredible. The beautiful, furious riffing is now replaced with heavier, less meorable chops. The perfect synth touches are replaced by a more 'rock out' vibe. The song lengths creep up, yet their catchiness/momorability creeps down. And HC just seems too much like \\"Mandrake 2' for it to be considered anything really special (though if you're in love with Mandrake, you should dig this one as well). EDGUY seem to have fallen into a 'play it safe' mode; thus, the albums aren't bad, but they won't create anything special for now either (NOCTURNAL RITES has had the same problem w/ the two albums following 'Afterife').
0689835604|5.0|I purchased this book for my grandson who is 18 months old, and he loves it.  It is always the first book he picks to have read to him, and he has learned body parts and had lots of fun peeking under the flaps.  Great book for 1-2 years of age, simple and fun to read together!
B0002RQ2T4|5.0|This one still can't be beat for its quality story, anime, sound, action. The story might be a bit complicated for simpletons but what can you do. If your an Adult looking for a Full length Action oriented Anime Feature with a Great story with no kiddy factor you found the best.
B00005NI5Y|2.0|Mississippi and Sugar Baby are great songs, up there with the best Dylan has done. However, the rest of the album, while listenable, isn't all that memorable. Still, I suppose it's amazing that he can still produce a couple of great songs still, after over 40 years performing and recording. The same cannot be said for '60s peers like Paul McCartney or the Stones. <br />Overall, Time Out of Mind was better, although that too was a little overrated, with only Not Dark Yet, Standing in the Doorway and Trying to Get to Heaven truly belonging to the canon of great Bob songs.  <br />
B00005JO20|4.0|I don't appreciate long reviews, so I'll keep this one short and to the point.  If you want to read a long review that gives away the movie and all it's plot and subplots, then look for another.   <br /> <br />Overall I think the movie was entertaining.  I've been thinking about all the unrealistic stuff in this movie, and it dawned on me that it should be a bid far fetched, yet possible.  Some really neet story lines and subplots.  What bothered me the most about this movie was the cheesy lines and drawn out scenes.  It's like Peter Jackson was trying to make some kind of epic by having the drawn out slow moving sceens.  He failed.  This movie is cgi and computer 3d heavy; and this work is high end but not edited so well.  The real kicker for me was at the end.  The most cheesy line of the whole movie: \\"The airplanes didn't get him, beauty killed the beast.\\"  Baaaaad.   <br /> <br />In conclusion, I would watch it again if I were with a friend that hadn't seen it yet.  The pole vaulting scenes were very cool.
B000BZ99WY|5.0|I couldn't help but cry when I finshed reading ''Shake hands with the devil''. It left me outraged, shaken, heart broken about the worlds ignorance at the tragic genocide in Rwanda twelve years ago. The horror that Mr. Dallaire had to witness tugs right on my heart strings. The guilt and regret of not doing more to stop the genocide left him scared in a nasty way(including being diagonosed with Post Tramatic Stress Disorder and suicide attempts.)But he has prevailed and gave us this gut renching couragus book that EVERYONE MUST READ!!!!!!!! My heart goes out to Mr. Dallaire whom I admire greatly. This book I will always hold very close to me. <br />                            Thanks for listening! <br />P.S. I also recommend ''A problem from hell'' by Samantha Power. Read my review.

B00005JOTV|3.0|Ashley Albright (Lindsay Lohan) has lived a charmed life.  When she goes outside in the rain, the sun comes out.  She just misses a crowded elevator and winds up alone with a very cute guy.  And when she must substitute for her boss at a meeting, she gets a promotion out of the deal.<br /><br />Jake Hardin (Chris Pine), on the other hand, could use a few good luck charms.  He works at the Rock 'n Bowl, a bowling alley with live musical entertainment.  He's found a great new group in McFly (playing themselves), but can't get their CD to an executive no matter what he tries.<br /><br />Ashley has put together a masquerade ball as a promotion for record label Masquerade.  Jake tries to crash the party to get McFly's CD to the label's executive just one more time.  The two meet, and its love at first site.  When they kiss, however, everything changes.<br /><br />It starts with Ashley breaking the heel of her shoe.  Things go downhill from there, and she's soon unemployed and living with her two friends.  Jake, meanwhile, gets McFly signed to a record deal and finds himself living in a great, spacious apartment with a limo at his service.<br /><br />Ashley hates her new life, and tries everything she can think of to get her luck back.  Her path keeps crossing Jake's and the two begin to fall in love.  What will happen when Ashley learns the truth?<br /><br />Yeah, I'll admit it.  I'm a Lindsay Lohan fan.  That coupled with some very funny previews made me want to see this movie.  Unfortunately, it didn't live up to its potential.<br /><br />Obviously with a movie like this, the story is fairly predictable.  It falls on the humor and the actors to make the journey to the end well worth watching.  The actors do a great job with their material.  You can't help but root for Ashley and Jake to find some way to deal with whatever it is they are currently facing.  And, of course, you're rooting for them to get together.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the humor fell flat.  While I don't mind slapstick, I don't enjoy humor where the person is in pain or is constantly making a fool out of themselves.  The humor in this movie fell almost entirely into those categories.  Instead of laughing, I spend most of the movie cringing, waiting for the joke to come.<br /><br />The ending works well, however.  It was very sweet and redeems much of the earlier parts of the film.<br /><br />The musical group featured in the film, McFly, is a real band.  They've just released a CD entitled (surprise, surprise) Just My Luck.  I was impressed enough with them to consider buying it but haven't yet.<br /><br />The movie's ok, and the friend I went to see it with loved it.

B0000025RI|5.0|Michael Jackson's \\"Thriller\\" is another must-have album for music lovers of all generations.    I personally feel like this album is one that stands the test of time though I understand how some might see it as somewhat dated.  However, that's why it's important to keep it in proper context to truly appreciate its greatness.    Seven top 10 singles from a nine-track album that was released in 1982 and still had the world jammin' to more hit singles three years later on radio! That kind of success just doesn't happen anymore.    Bobby Brown's 1988 solo album \\"Don't Be Cruel\\" and Usher's 2004 LP \\"Confessions\\" are about as close as any contemporary R&B/Pop act has come to Michael's Thriller success.  And though massively successful in terms of sales and radio spins, neither of these albums had hit singles getting major airplay beyond the first year to 18 months of their respective release dates.    Michael's album sold 45 million ... and, think, this was before the soundscan boom!    This was perhaps a one in a lifetime album (think Michael broke Elvis Presley and the Beatles' sales records so it should be decades upon decades before another artist from another time and place in music emerges to even begin to challenge Thriller's success).    A quick album breakdown:    *\\"Wanna Be Startin' Something\\" was a disco-themed, dance track    *\\"The Girl Is Mine\\" is a light, mellow ballad and duet he did with Paul MCartney -- massively popular!    *\\"Thriller\\" is the blockbuster ode to Halloween and creatures of the night that made for a monsterously popular hit single & perhaps the Greatest Video of All Time!    *\\"Beat It\\" was MJ's hit anthem song ... every great album's gotta have at least one.    *\\"Billie Jean\\" was another massively popular hit single and basically the ode to caniving, scheming women long before Kanye West's \\"Gold Digger\\" hit airwaves.    *\\"Pretty Young Thing (P.Y.T.)\\" is a second disco-flavored dance track that really helped cement this album's worldwide popularity.    Michael was an innovator because much like James Brown's influence on the Beatles, and before him, much how Little Richard's showmanship qualities were poorly copied by Pat Boone, MJ's style is still being copied by Justin Timberlake, Usher, Ginuwine, Omarion, Mario and a host of other knockoffs trying to mimmick greatness.    When you consider that MJ came before all this and is still inspiring new generations of new jacks, you've got to step aside and just appreciate greatness.    I wouldn't call \\"Thriller\\" the perfect album, but innovative, fresh and immensely influential through its artistry.    No music collection is complete without this album!    Highly recommended purchase.
B000BT97AO|3.0|well i just don't know how i feel about this film.  i went into this movie as a huge fan of gaiman, mckean, and jim henson presents; so i fully expected to adore this film with all my heart.  i'm not going to say i was dissappointed, i wasn't.  i just felt somewhat...unfulfilled by it. <br /> <br />the problem is i can't figure out exactly what my problem with it is.  it is visually stunning, thanks to dave mckean's amazing artwork and visual direction.  the acting is sometimes less than mind-blowing, but it isn't distracting.  the dialogue is neil gaiman excellent, everyone is consistently offering witty quips that don't seem forced or awkward.  plus, the \\"dark\\" queen and helena have spiffy full eye black contact lenses, which for some reason i've always loved.  who could ask for anything more? <br /> <br />i think the problem lies mainly in the editing, actually.  what should be a great movie is reduced to being only ok because of poor pacing and drawn out scenes with little to no purpose.  and so i suppose for this the blame must fall on my beloved dave mckean, an admission that hurts me more than him, surely. <br /> <br />but as i've already said, mirrormask is not all bad, in fact it's not bad at all.  it's just not great.  i would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of any of the parties involved, especially gaiman fans.  even with the distracting visuals, his writing is startlingly good as always.
0440241588|4.0|This book is so well written, as only John Grisham can.  The storyline was fantastic - a fastpaced thriller.  However, when it came to unfold, I was expecting a lot more action than what was actually written.
B0009W5JS2|1.0|XXX: State of the Union (Lee Tamahori, 2005)<br /><br />Whither, Lee Tamahori? Whither?<br /><br />Tamahori continues the long and undistinguished tradition of fantastic directors from overseas (in his native New Zealand, Tamahori was responsible for Once Were Warriors, one of the country's most beloved and enduring film exports) coming to Hollywood and making absolute [...] What's worse, Tamahori, screenwriter Simon Kinberg, and (mostly) producers Neal Moritz and Arne Scmidt, have taken the most promising spy movie franchise since James Bond burst onto the scene and have spared no expense grinding it into the dust.<br /><br />Gibbons (Samuel L. Jackson) needs to recruit a new XXX after the old one decided not to renew his contract (probably after reading this dog of a screenplay). He pulls the lieutenant from his old unit, Darius Stone (Ice Cube), out of prison to help him overthrow one of their old nemeses, the current Secretary of Defense (Willem Dafoe), who's planning something nefarious.<br /><br />Compared to the franchise's first film, this one's a pale shadow. Lots of things blow up again, but that's really the only similarity between the two. The character development, the sense of pace, the attempts at getting the viewer to identify with anyone at all in the film, all gone. This is a movie for people who like to watch stuff blow up, and don't care about anything else. A horrible, horrible disappointment. *
B000000OAA|5.0|Though it opens on a weak track and has the terrible Bring Back That Leroy Brown, Sheer Heart Attack is one of Queen's best. Without the two mentioned tracks, it may be their best ever. <br />It was clever, mature and contained some of Queen's best ever songs. It rocked, romanced and contained almost as many styles as A Night At The Opera. <br />1. Brighton Rock isn't a solid opener. It was done better one Live Killers and is one of the lesser tracks on the album. <br />2. Killer Queen is one of Queen's best and their biggest single to date.  <br />3. Tenement Funster is a nice slow rocker from Roger. His best to date and leads into <br />4. Flick Of The Wrist which is a Freddie written mixed jumbled rocker. One of the highlights from the album and in turn leads into <br />5. Lily Of The Valley which is one of Queen's best ever songs. It starts off with a beautiful, soft piano and builds to a wonderful guitar crashing crescendo, something Queen have done so well over their reign. No one does a sub two minute song better than queen. <br />6. Now I'm Here was the second single and was Queen in heavy mode. Written by Brian and containing some great rock elements, not the most memorable of their singles, but a great song. <br />7. In The Lap Of The Gods bursts in, fades and the rises again and though not as good as it's reprise has some great elements. One of the highlights from the album. <br />8. Stone Cold Crazy is another Queen rocker. Not a favorite of mine but fits nicely in the middle of this album. <br />9. Dear Friends is short and simple. A nice track written by Brian. <br />10. Misfire was the first song John penned and is a nice likeable tune. Showed the style of song John would contribute in the future and is a good track. Perhaps a bit soft compared to the rest of the album but hard not to like. <br />11. Bring Back That Leroy Brown is one of Queen's worst tracks and doesn't fit in on this album.  <br />12. She Makes Me is a Brian written and sung song. It's slow and soft and is a nice track without being a great track. <br />13. In The Lap Of The Gods along with Lily Of The Valley is the highlight on the album and one of Queen's best ever. Perhaps could fade out a little earlier at the end but is a brilliant close to a classic album. <br /> <br />Sheer Heart Attack ranks third on Queen's all time best behind A Day At The Races, Innuendo and above, The Game. <br />
0143034901|5.0|Like The Historian by Elizabeth Kostova (another must read), this book transports you as you read it. The setting is mainly Barcelona, and the reading is beautiful. It is so easy to picture everything that is happening! As you read, you fall in love with each of the characters who seem as real as your neighbors. This book kept me up for several nights because it was so enthralling, I could never guess what was coming up next (which is awesome!) The ending is very satisfying and I will be looking for future books from Zafon, as soon as they come out I will put them at the top of my \\"Must Read\\" stack. Don't miss out on this wonderful book, the time you take to read it will be a delightful experience!
B000000OA6|5.0|Thank God for Innuendo. This is Queen at their best. After a decade of solid, anthem rock style albums, Innuendo came along and changed all that, showing Queen still had the smarts and the balls to do what they wanted. Instead of writing songs to fill stadiums, Queen wrote for the fans and for themselves. I like the sound of Freddie's voice on this one. It changed over the years and has a reinvigorated quality to it here.    1. Innuendo is an awesome song. Written by Roger, it's a Bohemian Rhapsody for the 90's and almost as good.   2. I'm Going Slightly Mad follows and keeps the standard high. Written by Freddie it has a nice rolling rhythm. One of their best.  3. Headlong is also one of their best ever. Queen knew how to rock and this proves it. A great Brian rocker.  4. I Can't Live With You is a Brian song with some nice changes. Not a highlight but a great song. Originally earmarked for Brian's solo album.  5. Don't Try So Hard is a beautiful song. It's soft, it's heavy and Freddie's vocal is wonderful.  6. Ride The Wild Wind is Roger rocker. Roger's songs on this album are brilliant.   7. All Gods People was originally from Freddie's Barcelona sessions. It fits in nicely here as a good change in sort of gospel style.  8. These Are The Days Of Our Lives is a beautiful Roger song. Sad, very sad.  9. Delilah is Freddie singing about his cat. It's charming.  10. The Hitman rocks things up. An overly long ending ruins it a bit though. The change in Freddie's voice is most evident here.  11. Bijou is a stunning song. One of the saddest I've heard and always touches me.  12. The Show Must Go On is a great closer and one of Queen's best. It must go on indeed.    Innuendo is second only to A Day At The Races in the Queen catalogue. Unfortunately they regained their form too late.
B00005JL0U|5.0|Not having this on DVD is a shame.  This was a truly great film, and deserves to be on DVD.  How hard could it be?  Trust me, with things like Amazon.com, anyone who doesn't want to admit that they would like to buy it, can do so in the privacy of their own home.  It would sell, tremendously!!
B000000OAN|4.0|A Night At The Opera is truly a musical masterpiece. Though not a favorite among Queen albums of mine, I am able to appreciate its brilliance. Musically I guess it's not surpassed by any album (by anyone) ever, there are a few lesser tracks on it for me that lessen it's impact though. <br />1. Death On Two Legs is a great opener. A nice rocking hate song. <br />2. Lazing On A Sunday Afternoon is one of Queen's best songs. Sung by Freddie with the use of a steel can it showed Queen having fun and we thank them for it. <br />3. I'm In Love With My Car is a Roger track and is again fun. It rocks along nicely and builds to a great harmonious roar. <br />4. You're My Best Friend is a Queen classic. One of their lighter singles it was the first of many John songs to be hits. <br />5. '39 is a song about space travel that I always though was a song about WW2. I guess I never paid enough attention to the lyrics. Listening to it though, you can hear the Sci-Fi elements and the sadness in the song. Kind of like Queen's Space Oddity (by Bowie). <br />6. Sweet Lady is one of the lesser tracks for me. It rocks but the music changes don't flow like Queen changes normally do.  <br />7. Seaside Rendezvous is a highlight.  Similar feel to Lazing On A Sunday Afternoon. <br />8. The Prophet's Song is an attempt at greatness. It shows in some spots, but lacks something. Apparently rushed near the completion of the album, I don't know if this is the final product Brian intended. A great track all the same and some more fantasitic Queen harmonies. <br />9. Love Of My Life is a beautiful Freddie track. He could do any style better than anyone else.  <br />10. Good Company is another one of those lesser tracks. Also written by Brian, is has brilliant guitar work (I have renewed appreciation for it after viewing the making of DVD) but the song itself is a bit left -field. <br />11. Bohemian Rhapsody is the best ever. Simply the greatest song to ever grace our radios. <br />12. God Save TheQueen is not what I would call a great closer. I see what they were trying to do but it's not a song you can listen to and enjoy - surely even if you are English. <br /> <br />A Night At The Opera is a brilliant as anything they've done for the most part, but some lesser tracks bring it down a few rungs. Ranks in the middle for all Queen albums, below Queen 2, above News Of The World. <br />
B000002IAZ|5.0|This is a GREAT collection of songs from a GREAT band! One reviewer said that there was too much talent for this band. Very nicely said, I wish I would've come up with that line. It is just really good rock 'n roll..it's defining rock 'n roll...it's music that makes you want to learn how to play and start your own rock 'n roll band.<br /><br />My only objection to this great compilation is that on this particular release, they omitted the great song \\"Pretty Girl, Why?\\" I don't know why they did this, because it's a great piece of psychedelia...very trippy and very, very cool.<br /><br />It's really hard for me to pinpoint one particular song and claim that it stands out above the rest, because they all stand on their own. I don't have any favorites on this collection because they are all sooo incredible and sooo beautiful and sooo absolutely wonderful.<br /><br />Expecting to Fly just moves me and Rock 'n Roll Woman just grooves me....oh, I could go on and on...just buy it. And for you kids who are torn between this and something that was just put out, stick with the tried and true and buy this CD and get a crash course on what rock 'n roll is supposed to sound like.
B000000OAC|4.0|Following A Day At The Races, New Of The World was a change in style. Harder and less experimental than previous efforts, Queen had settled into and anthem rocking style that would see them as one of the best ever live bands. This album was the start of that. It was also the start of John and Roger offering more tracks than their previous one track per album - in most cases. <br /> <br />1. We Will Rock You was an accidental hit and is one of Queen's signature tunes and perhaps the most recognizable. <br />2. We Are The Champions is another anthem rocker. A great song but not up with their best. <br />3. Sheer Heart Attack is a great track. Fast and frenzied it's one of Queen's best. Perhaps let down by the whining guitar solo. <br />4. All Dead, All Dead is a Brian song and one of the highlights from the album. <br />5. Spread Your Wings is a John written song and one of Queen's worst single releases. <br />6. Fight From The Inside is a Roger track and one of his lesser songs. <br />7. Get Down Make Love is a good track. Not a highlight but has its qualities. <br />8. Sleeping On The Sidewalk is another Brian song. It's an OK song but a lesser track. <br />9. Who Needs You is one of Queen's worst tracks. It's another John song and is his second misfire on this album. Too soft and corny. <br />10. It's Late is one of Queen's best. It rocks hard and long. <br />11. My Melancholy Blues is a Freddie gem. A great closer to a hit and miss album. <br /> <br />News Of The World was a change for Queen and while it heralded some classics, there are almost as many forgettable numbers here. The middle tracks are among Queen's poorest offerings.  <br /> <br />Ranking wise, it's below A Night At The Opera, above Hot Space.  <br />
B000002KCF|5.0|Michael Franks was first introduced to me in 1986 by my girlfriend at the time. I immediately took to his style; cool, hip, understated, and yet incredibly powerful...just the way \\"true jazz\\" should be.<br /><br />When I broke up with that girl, I felt as though my world was split in two. I would look at the things she left in my possession; a hairpin, a bracelet, and a copy of Michael Franks, \\"The Art of Tea\\". I'd look at the cover of that record (yes, vinyl) and it would almost mock me. I couldn't bring myself to listen to it because everytime I heard it, I thought of \\"that beautiful girl in my throw-away world\\"...such are the dramatics of a 21 year old without much life experience under his belt.<br /><br />I have learned the \\"art of forgiveness\\" through the \\"Art of Tea\\". Yeah, there were times where I'd just to \\"forget to smile\\" but the more I listened to it, the more I began to realize what the true gift of my relationship was with that girl. She came into my life at just the right time to learn how to appreciate all of life...not just the good moments...not just the beautiful moments...but the sad and tragic moments, as well. And that's what I really hear Michael Franks singing about.<br /><br />Yeah, life is dramatic but it doesn't mean we have to be involved with \\"cheap drama\\". We can learn to embrace the highs as well as the lows and you can if you make this recording one of the soundtracks to your life.<br /><br />Know that you are a beautiful blessing.
B000000OAH|4.0|Jazz saw the return of Roy Thomas Baker as producer (Queen had produced the previous two albums with the help of engineer Mike Stone) but didn't see a return to form that the earlier albums produced. Jazz is hit and miss - like the previous News Of The World was. <br /> <br />1. Mustapha is a great opener. I love this song. <br />2. Fat Bottomed Girls is a classic track. While it loses some punch with the extended version found on the album (the single version is better) it still rocks the cellulite. <br />3. Jealousy is one of the last great Freddie ballads (like You Take My Breath Away or Love Of My Life). From here on he tended to be heavier or groovier. <br />4. Bicycle Race is one of my all time favorites. One of my earliest Queen memories and one of their best songs. <br />5. If You Can't Beat Them is one of a string of John disasters. It tries to rock but doesn't. This album and News Of The World showcased the worst of John. <br />6. Let Me Entertain You is a good track but was done better live. <br />7. Dead On Time is a nice Brian rocker but not a memorable song. <br />8. In Only Seven Days is another John failure. One of Queen's worst. Thankfully he redeems himself from here on. <br />9. Dreamers Ball has a nice feel. Written by Brian it's one of the better non single tracks on the album. <br />10. Fun It is a lesser track. Written by Roger and sung by Freddie and Roger, it doesn't offer much. <br />11. Leaving Home Ain't Easy is a nice Brian song. Again, nothing great but nice. The last song to feature Brian on lead vocals (on an album). On subsequent albums he'd only have brief interludes. <br />12. Don't Stop Me Now is one of Queen's best ever songs. It's got so much drive and is a powerful song. <br />13. More Of That Jazz (no thanks) is a weak closer. The quick sequence of previous tracks added in the middle does nothing for it. It's a Roger song and along with Fun It was probably his worst album writing-wise. <br /> <br />Jazz is a bit disappointingon a whole, but contains some of Queen's best ever songs. Ranks second last in albums, below The Miracle, above Queen 1. <br />
1400079179|4.0|I was wary of all the hype surrounding this book but I guess I stand corrected; this is one heckuva ride! In order to enjoy this you have to accept certain aspects of Christianity that may not sit right with everyone, but I suppose one should keep in mind that this stuff isn't real -- fiction is only that: fiction!<br /><br />So don't sweat it, just read it and take it for the adventure it is. I'm glad I did!<br /><br />--Mike
B000000OAL|4.0|Queen 1 sits at the top of best debut albums of the 70's, right next to Cheap Trick's self titled effort. <br />From the opening, you can tell there's so much talent on offer. It fades at the end but you're left with 8 killer tracks of varying styles. The Queen sound has always been unique, the songs finely crafted and perfected. That what sets them above any other band that has ever been. <br />1. Keep Yourself Alive is the opener and first single. Original, clever and memorable, though never a hit, it shows how good Queen were so early. It sounds good and ages well, but for a better version, check out Live Killers. <br />2. Doin' Alright is a mix of softness and rock that would be a taste of how Queen could seamlessly mix styles within songs . The song itself is OK but not a highlight. <br />3. Great King Rat was along a fantasy theme that Freddie wrote about on the early albums. It's a great rocker, again with varying styles. <br />4. My Fairy King is my pick from the album. Freddie vocal, the harmonies (another trademark) and guitar work are on show here. <br />5. Liar is a highlight and an early Queen favourite. Probably the straightest rocker on the album, doesn't have the changes and craftsmanship of most other tracks, but show Queen could stand up and rock as good as anyone. <br />6. The Night Comes Down is a softer song written by Brian. Nice guitar work - though you could say that on almost every song..... <br />7. Modern Times Rock and Roll is a Roger written and sung track. Nice fast rocker but not one of Roger's best. <br />8. Son And Daughter is another straight up rock song. Not a highlight but has a good groove. <br />9. Jesus is one of Queen's worst tracks. Don't know what Freddie was on about here, maybe they needed a quick song to complete the album. <br />10. Seven Seas Of Rhye is a nice musical piece but pales in comparison to the full version on Queen 2. <br /> <br />This album is not as satisfying as any of their other albums but showed what was to come. A great first up effort and though ranks at the bottom of all Queen albums (only Flash is lower), it shows just how good they were (are) if this was their worst effort!! <br />
B000F3AAUW|4.0|I haven't been this enthused over new music in a while.  Great production, a pastiche of musical sounds, including trip-hop, Beatlesque pop, soul, with distinctive vocals and effects.  The cover of the Violent Femme's \\"Gone Daddy Gone\\" is a sure-fire hit.  \\"Crazy\\" is impossible to get out of your mind.  \\"Just a Thought\\" is a soul slow-burner.  There are a few songs that might be described as filler, but overall a strong contender for album of the year.<br /><br />One quibble -- Danger Mouse, please try hiring a real drummer for a change.  Sure they're pains in the [...], but they round out the sound nicely sometimes.
B000000OE7|5.0|Released after Freddie's death, Made In Heaven is a fine tribute to a great man and gives us all some lasting songs from this wonderful band recorded soon before and after his death. <br />Sure it has some remakes of Freddie's solo songs and a couple of others but Queen can redo anything and I'll buy it. <br />1. It's A Beautiful Day is a sweet opener. <br />2. Made In Heaven is a revamped rockier version from Freddie's Mr. Bad Guy.  <br />3. Let Me Live is a nice track with the three vocalists having a turn - I suspect because Freddie wasn't able to complete all the vocals himself. <br />4. Mother Love is a great song. Freddie vocal never sounded better. <br />5. My Life Has Been Saved is a remake of a song from The Miracle B Sides. Not much different to the original but it's a great song that needed more exposure than simply a B Side to a single. <br />6. I Was Born To Love You is a rockier version of Freddie's original. This is a great remake and a highlight from the album. <br />7. Heaven For Everyone is a remake of a Roger song. It's a nice song and the first single from the album. <br />8. Who Wants To Live Forever is a remake of Brian's solo. I don't like this version. It's nice to hear Freddie sing it, but Brian's version will remain the best version to me. <br />9. You Don't Fool Me is the pick of the original songs here and perhaps the best track from the album. Written by John it's classic Queen. <br />10. A Winter's Tale was Freddie's last song. It's special and though not his best, has a quality to it. <br />11. It's A Beautiful Day (Reprise) is a nice rocking version of the opening track. A good finish - well should have been. <br />12/13. Not sure what's happening here or why. They should have let Freddie finish things up, not this noise. A disappointing ending to an amazing band. <br /> <br />Made In Heaven is a solid effort. Ranking wise it sits in the middle, under The Game, above The Works. <br />
B000002VCO|5.0|I enjoy this album. If the music moves you, it moves you, whether it's pop, opera, or whatever. This album helped me get out of a bad relationship, along with Vulture Culture. I enjoy the entire APP catalog. I also say OF COURSE Alan was influenced by the 80s culture. This album was released SMACK DAB in the middle of the 80s. I commend Alan, Eric, et al for producing this nice collection of thoughtful songs. These are enjoyable songs, each with a great message. ONE GOOD REASON is the ultimate break-up song, which every young naive guy needs at some point. Buy it, play it, enjoy it.<br /><br />Update to my previous review: This is one of The Alan Parsons Project's greatest albums. It's difficult to choose among them; they are all fantastic. I bought this album in 1995 (in CD format) and it has never left my regular playing rotation. \\"Ammonia Avenue\\" was released in 1984, the same year as the following album \\"Vulture Culture.\\" By this time, APP had sort of moved away from strictly them-based albums into a more pop friendly format. I know some fans prefer the earlier albums, and that is fine, but I enjoy all of them. These songs are fantastic individually, but they also work great together in this album.<br /><br />Alan Parsons' music has been a very important part of my life ever since I discovered it, and this album is right up there. The music is both simple and complex at the same time. The melodies are catchy, and even the first time you hear them, they feel somehow familiar. At the same time, they are deep and complex enough to remain one of your favorites for years to come. Highly recommended.
B00004S6GL|4.0|Figure 8 is another great album released by Elliott Smith.  There are many reviews here that complain about this album being over produced and there are also many reviews that complain about those who are complaining.  I'm here to say that Elliott's earlier purely acoustic work and latter more produced work are both great.<br /><br />This album is no exception.  Unfortunately for this album, I find it to be his least consistent.  Some of the songs on this album are some of his best he has ever written (eg Son of Sam, LA, Everything Reminds Me of Her, Everything Means Nothing to Me) but there are a couple of very passable songs (eg In the Lost and Found).<br /><br />Overall, it's a very good album, but don't take my word for it.  If you're a fan, this is a must.  If you're just looking to get into Elliott Smith, check out Either/Or or XO- those tend to be his most popular.  From a Basement on the Hill is my favorite.
B00000272N|5.0|This landmark release does not need an exceeding amount of words to describe its attributes. All I cab say is: \\"Well done!... well done, indeed.\\" This Metal listener is proud to own it.  <br /> <br />Since its release more than a decade now, this cd still receives multiple play in my player.  <br /> <br />We miss you Layne.....Never surrender \m/ <br /> <br />
B000DZIGE4|4.0|is about the best line in Jarhead. Not really about war or it's aftermath, but the waiting for a war to begin.    Anticpation can work on you. These Marines  are primed for action. It's oppressively hot, they are on edge, with nothing to do but [...] They are out on the endless vistas of the desert where the enemy can pick them off at any time. Jake Gyllenhaal does a creditable job as Swofford the author of the book, narrator & main character of the movie. Actually \\"Swoff\\" felt he had little choice. His father was a Marine whose life was screwed up by Vietnam, & his grandfather before that was also a Marine. So Swoff joined without a whole lot of conviction. They turned him into a sniper. Jamie Foxx is Sykes, Swoff's Sgt. & mentor. His mission in life is to keep his men alive. If he is not loved by his men he is respected & you'd want him to have your back. Basically, Jamie Foxx dominates every scene he is in. They all want action & desire to kill the enemy, including Swoff. Eventually war does come & Swoof is to get a chance to use the specialty he been trained for. At the last second, it is snatched away & hours later the war was over. I understood his frustration. Yet knowing he did not kill a man for any good reason might stay with him longer than his frustration. He never fires his weapon in war, his war, which he says lasted about four days, after half a year of inactivity in the desert. The horror of all those oil wells burning was brought to the screen in some great special effects. Scenes of boot camp are always fun, spotting the inaccuracies. More fun if you've been there. Don't expect much action in this \\"War\\" movie.
0307277674|5.0|Suspense, mystery, and an amazingly visual story line graces the pages of this masterpiece of a book. While \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" is an excellent read,<br /><br />believe absolutely nothing in the book!!!! It's all pure FICTION!!!<br /><br />Controversial yet surprisingly good I only read the book to understand the movie. But I hadn't seen the movie yet. I've watched the trailers yes, so it was hard for me to think of Robert Langdon being some one other than Tom Hanks. THis book is fictional and YET IS AN ASTOUNDING PIECE OF FICTION! Read this book but, even though you're tired of hearing me say it, remember BELIEVE NOTHING YOU READ!!
0375831002|1.0|I heard about this book on Public Radio and I read it, even though it is written for teens.  It kept me glued to the pages with a perspective not often seen. It is written about a young German girl during the war and the narrator is  Death.  The character Death is as amazing as the young girl Leisel and those around her. His care of the souls he collects and the colors he sees in everything thoughtful and caring.  It is a book I could not put down.
0307159531|5.0|If you have read the first book, The Monster at the End of this Book, you will absolutely LOVE this sequel.  The child I read it to loves it so much he wants his own copy, but not in board book because he is 5.  It is a great book for children and adults alike.
B00000099Y|5.0|A metal/rock classic.  Its a must have for any collection.  TooL is like no other band.   Trust me/us.
B000BFH2S2|5.0|I bought this CD after buying a DVD called The Wedding Date. <br />Most of the songs performed on this sound track are his, and I fell in love with Sway, and Home.  He has a very mellow, dreamy, sound, much reminiscent of Frank Sinatra or more recently Harry Connick Jr. My nineteen yr old daughter is also a fan of his now and in the future. The CD itself is good but, if you purchase this item be sure to get the edition with the concert DVD also, as there are more selections on this, but only 8 to 10 selections on the CD itself.
0788821075|5.0|Julia Roberts and Richard Gere magnetize the entire film and pull you into a fantasy land where dreams do come true.  I understand the naysayers, but this film is not about Julia Roberts being a hooker.  Obviously, some people find that horribly offensive.  This movie is about love, gaining self-respect and believing in yourself (Kit . . . \\"take care of YOU\\").  It's a feel good film about pursuing your dreams.  Obviously, if some 14 year old decides she wants to be a hooker when she grows up so she can meet her prince charming, she needs some serious guidance.  Yet I highly doubt even most 14 year old's are that stupidly literal about a film such as this.  I'm 50 years old and, you know what?  A LOT of my dreams HAVE come true in ways I never would have expected, including romatically.  So there;0).
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|Buy this, now!  The orginal was great, and now this edition will blow you away.  Ive heard that Kingdom of Heaven's Director's cut compares to Braveheart and Gladiator.  And that is would have been up for a lot of Oscar's if they put out this version in the theatres instead.  Its a great movie, buy it!
B000GRUMPU|1.0|The producers of this movie may believe that all the special effects make it unsinkable, but after hitting multiple icebergs of bad plot, bad dialogue, bad character development, even bad background music and a bad torch song, it sinks like a lead zeppelin. The special effects were fine, but I can't say they were better than the special effects in the 1972 version. I can't believe that the same director who did Das Boot and The Perfect Storm did this; it is not Wolfgang Petersen's style to keep things moving from one special effects crisis to the next. This film is the most pathetic so far this year, and I hope it doesn't even garner any special effects Oscar nominations; it's better left on the bottom of the sea and forgotten. There may be survivors in the story, but there are none in the audience.
B000EQ4G5K|1.0|Hey kids!  If you're looking for music that's as satisfying and refreshing as a frozen sugar cube, deeper than a pool that's a foot deep and more exciting than watching paint dry, look no further than Rihanna's album, A Girl Like Me!  Listen to her wonderful studio-altered, digitally processed voice!  Gasp at the thought-provoking lyrics about needing to be rescued, falling in love and wanting to make love all night long!  Marvel at the synths, bleeps and squiggly sound effects that represent real reggae!  Forget no-good corporate hacks like Bob Marley, Peter Tosh, Dennis Brown, Damian Marley, I Wayne and Sizzla, because Rihanna is the real deal and she wants you, boys!  What an astounding, brilliant, masterfully crafted work of perfection!  I like music, and I like Rihanna!  She's just as brilliant as amazing artists like Britney Spears, Good Charlotte and Simple Plan!  They should all tour together, how great would that be? ... <br /> <br />... Alright, enough already.  I can't keep this facade up any longer.  That was just me channeling one of those incredibly enthusiastic, overzealous Rihanna marks that think she's the greatest thing since sliced bread.  I wholeheartedly beg to differ.  While her work ethic is to be commended somewhat (second album in 8 or 9 months, but all she contributes is her weak vocals), A Girl Like Me is just another example of what's gone so horrible wrong with the music industry - the fact that labels still insist on pushing shallow disposable rubbish on everyone.  Essentially what is wrong with this album is presented in the first paragraph as backhanded compliments.  <br /> <br />On top of this, the fact that Rihanna is just another Beyonce wannabe (who herself is a Diana Ross wannabe) just makes matters worse - the overuse of melismas on this album is enough to drive any sane person mad.  But what makes this album a special type of awful is the fact that it is being marketed as reggae.  Now, there's some people that feel that modernreggae artists (such as Elephant Man, Sean Paul, even Matisyahu) don't hold a candle to the originators (like Marley and Tosh), but I have grown to enjoy it and recognize it as the evolution of the genre.  However, Rihanna is as close to reggae as a band like Fall Out Boy is to punk - in other words, the term reggae must be used VERY loosely.  An occasional Caribbean drum flourish and use of the dialect does not a reggae song make.  This is much closer to a hybrid of Beyonce and Britney Spears, right down to keeping the barely legal Rihanna's wardrobe budget low by having her prance around in only the skimpiest of outfits.  I can just imagine these comments from the director at one of her video shoots: \\"Hey, Rihanna, what are you doing out here in your underwear?  Didn't that outfit that we ordered arrive yet?  What's that?  The record label wouldn't front the money to cover the cost of the wardrobe?  Oh well, I guess we'll shoot anyway.  One thing is certain: The teenage boys will love this video.\\". <br /> <br />In summary: A Girl Like Me is only worth checking out if you can't get enough of banal, vacuous pop garbage.  This is not reggae, ska, soca, etc.  It's bubblegum pop, and it's a style that has run its course and is becoming very irritating.  It's easy to market, and that's why MTV is playing the video every 10 minutes.  Speaking of the single, it's really just juvenile lyrics buttressed by the melody of Soft Cell's version of \\"Tainted Love\\" - nothing special at all.  The rest of the album is equally shallow pop with only a slight Caribbean influence, bookended by remixes of songs from Rihanna's last album.  I urge you to look past MTV and \\"hit music\\" stations to find better music, reggae or otherwise.
068817776X|5.0|This is a well-written non-fiction memoir that reads like a novel. Edith is a remarkable, spirited, and resourceful Austrian Jewish woman who lived among the Nazis and survived. Edith had her share of luck, too, receiving help, sometimes unexpectedly, at key times and places. Her account is honest and she doesn't rationalize her dilemmas nor back off from her ambivalence. She acknowledges \\"survivor guilt\\" but doesn't overplay it. I found it amusing when early on in the story, while she is attending university, Edith considered Hitler's rantings as so much pseudo-intellectual tripe, assuming he would be soon forgotten. Edith underestimated the appeal of a demagogue like Hitler and overestimated the discernment of her fellow Austrians and Germans.
6304712944|5.0|This film deserves its five stars for many reasons. One is the young Vanessa Redgrave, stately, gorgeous, limpidly serene as Guinevere; another is Richard Harris (God forbid that we should only remember him as Dumbledore); yet another is Franco Nero (C'est moi! C'est moi! C'est moi!). And finally, the little known but nonetheless admirable David Hemmings as Mordred (deliciously smarmy!).    Another reason is that this film is centrally placed in the Arthurian tradition. \\"Camelot\\" conveys the heart-breaking vision of T.H. White's Once and Future King -- itself based on Thomas Malory's fifteenth-century \\"Morte Darthur\\" -- to a modern audience. Perhaps the singing in the movie could have been better. But it's passable, and this film's virtues far outweigh its defects.    Let me just enumerate a few of the high points: The wonderful scene in which, on her way to Camelot, Guinevere escapes through the snow to croon the memorable \\"Where are the Simple Joys of Maidenhood,\\" only to be discovered by her future husband quite incognito; Lancelot fighting Arthur - again incognito - whom he unexpectedly defeats \\"in the name of King Arthur\\"; Guinevere's comeuppance when Lancelot knocks down all of the knights she's set against him in a tournament, and his comeuppance in return when, after reviving one who seems to be fatally wounded, he stares into Guinevere's eyes and the two fall in love.    Of course, such stuff is corny! That's what's great about it! \\"Camelot\\" makes \\"happy ever-aftering\\" a virtue not to be underestimated.
0812565886|4.0|Persuasion is an interrupted love story, not as piquant as Austen's other novels, but stimulating and provocative in more subtle ways. In a way, it is a study of how we are influenced or persuaded to make choices in our lives, both from within and without, and it is also a study of character. Anne is by far the most likable character, and it is her innately good character that is contrasted with all the others, but for me, Anne is far too restrained to be wholly likable. In one scene, Anne translates an Italian libretto, which she does with great skill, but she refuses to go beyond mere translation and discuss the music due to its romantic nature, which would be inappropriate. The overriding concern for all the characters is always to be socially correct. Persuasion lacks any really spritied characters. But then, why should all stories have spirited characters? There's nothing wrong with a story about more ordinary people. And the way Austen has these \\"ordinary\\" people talking, it is pure literary pleasure to read and savor the English language expressed so eloquently.
0385504209|1.0|How in God's name can a large albino man confined to wearing a monk outfit and bleeding from a torture device attached to his leg clandestinely attack people in a major city without getting caught?  These and other stupefying questions will come to mind when reading this book.  Furthermore:<br /><br />1) The use of French phrases throughout the book was unnecessary and pretentious.<br /><br />2) Could ANY police force be that incompetent?<br /><br />3) Could one, just ONE character been interesting (ok the Professor wasn't too bad).<br /><br />The combination of all this and other things really lost me.  The book had little credibility just by how it was written (i.e. poor character development, implausible scenarios, predictable romance) leaving aside the controversy of the subject matter.  Read another religious based best seller from 25 years ago instead: The Name of the Rose by Umberto Eco.
B000002N1E|4.0|I'm not referring to the reviewers, I'm referring to the sellers on the Amazon Marketplace. <br /> <br />A new Gold Experience cd costs 58.00-66.00. <br /> <br />A used Gold Experience cd costs 20.00 AT LEAST. <br /> <br />These folks know this album is out of print therefore are purposely driving the cost up. Capitalism at its worst. <br /> <br />I want this cd, but I'll be darned if I spend an arm and leg for it. I can wait. I can wait for some record company to come to their senses and put this back in print.
B000EULJLU|5.0|completed my tool collection yet again by buying this cd, <br />in certain parts of 10,000 it kind of seems to drag on.  <br />when you get that feeling that a song has been going on for too long - you just CANNOT HELP but reach for that next track button. <br /> <br />which is why i can't recommend this cd to just about anyone, <br />get Lateralus or aenima if you dont already own them both. <br /> <br />- the average tool fan
B000EMGAOY|5.0|Theres not much to say about this album besides the fact that it is simply awesome. Song after song it just keeps hitting you hard. I cant believe some people are actually giving this negative reviews on this website, although I am seeing less and less of the negative reviews recently. Im surprised this isnt getting five stars in average. It certainly deserves it. Everything about this album is perfect. John has never sounded better on the guitar. How can you deny the genius of songs such as Dani California, Snow Hey Oh, Desecration Smile, and Turn it Again. Theres no way these songs will not go down in history as some of the best ever written. I think this album will win every award there is to win simply because it is so much better than anything else that has been released in the last 20 years. Please...please...please...ignore the negative reviews and take my word, and everyone elses word who has found this album as incredible, and buy this as soon as you can. It is a massive success and will go down in history as one of the best rock albums ever.
0553260111|4.0|What can I say. Once again the book is better than the movie. I first saw the Bourne Identity on the big screen and found it to be a thrilling movie. It thrilled me enough to buy the book. After reading the book, the movie seemed very mediocre. So much more explanation is put into the book that is never seen in the movie. I found myself fully immersed in the role of Jason Bourne and just wanted to know what was going to happen. <br /> <br />The one and only problem that I found was when reading dialogue, You lose track of which character is actually speaking. <br /> <br />However a really great book, worth reading before watching the film.
B000EOTAM6|1.0|This movie is what total crap is all about. You don't have to explain the story. You don't have to make sense. Put a hot chick in a movie, throw in some nifty special effects and people will love it! I saw this movie at the theater. I should have demanded my money back.     Did I mention that this movie was bad? For people that have trouble following movies like Total Recall or even Mission Impossible, this movie would make you have a nervous breakdown.     Aeon Flux is very, very bad. I'd rather watch CSPAN than ever see this movie again. Charlize is a great actress, but in this she's just prop for bad movie making.[...]
B000FIMG68|5.0|The Season 2 finale next week is suppose to be mind blowing according to J.J. Abrams, but I still don't think this season is nearly as strong as the first (the ratings have gone way down as well). I still love the show and like the addition of Mr. Eko, but I'm not too fond of Ana-Lucia or any of the other tailies. More of the episodes here feel like filler and the sense of dread is almost gone. Still, I find it hard to complain about one of the most unique and addictive shows on television. Bring on Season 3!
B000002G23|5.0|The Police, founded in 1977 by drummer Stewart Copeland, was a rock band like no other.  Though much of their early work is clearly punk rock-inspired, the band is most popular due to a style of music which they invented: reggae rock.  From the release of their first single in 1977 to their official disbandment in 1986, The Police garnered legions of fans, thanks to their creativity and unique style and sound.  Sting led the band with his prominent bass lines, vocals which fluctuated from furious to calm and dreamy, and intelligent lyrics.  Andy Summers' atmospheric guitar work was always flawless; as was Stewart Copeland's fast, inventive and often unpredictable drumming.  To me, one of the greatest parts of the band is that each member seemed equal.  Though Sting is obviously the most famous of the bunch, he seems equal with the other members of the band when you listen to their music.  All in all, The Police were most definitely a force to be reckoned with.    MESSAGE IN A BOX: THE COMPLETE RECORDINGS collects every studio recording The Police ever made, as well as some live recordings.  It consists of 78 tracks spread over four discs.  Along with the songs found on the band's albums, MESSAGE IN A BOX also contains rare B-sides as well as compositions from the BRIMSTONE & TREACLE soundtrack.  To top it all off, there's a huge booklet filled with all sorts of juicy info about the band, including interviews and a Police timeline.  Also, every song in the set has been digitally remastered.  It's an offer no Police fan can refuse.    Disc one opens with three songs previously unavailable on CD.  Two of these, \\"Fall Out\\" and \\"Nothing Achieving\\", are from the band's first single; the third is \\"Dead End Job\\".  These are very different from the group's later work, as they're all punk rock bits, made blatantly clear by Henri Padovani's loud guitar (Padovani played the guitar part for the band's first two songs), Sting's fast singing, and Stewart Copeland's high-speed drumming.  Though I enjoy \\"Nothing Achieving\\" - primarily for Pavodani's guitar work - I am especially fond of \\"Fall Out\\".  The tune is catchy, and each of the band members is doing great.  I'd go so far as to rank this among the band's best recordings.    From there, we move on to the songs from OUTLANDOS D'AMOUR, the first album of The Police.  The quality of the songs is good, but they sound a little tinny, possibly due to the low-quality of the recording tools available to the band at the time.  OUTLANDOS D'AMOUR stands apart from the later Police recordings.  Half of the album is the sort of reggae-rock which the band would later produce; the other half is made up of punk rock songs.  It's an underrated album, in my opinion.  Though it's famous for featuring such greats as \\"So Lonely\\", \\"Roxanne\\", and \\"Can't Stand Losing You\\", the album has other impressive songs as well: \\"Next to You\\", the opening piece; \\"Hole in My Life\\"; and \\"Truth Hits Everybody\\".  OUTLANDOS D'AMOUR didn't do so well upon its release, due in part to a bad rap from the BBC and a few critics.  However, when \\"Roxanne\\" was re-released as a single in 1979, the album became a hit.    After the OUTLANDOS songs, we're treated to two less-than-spectacular live recordings of \\"Landlord\\" and \\"Next to You\\".  I've never been very impressed by the live work of The Police.  The songs sound too raw and fast-paced to me.  After these we get another rarity, \\"Landlord\\", which is notable for the awesome guitar part beginning at 0:05 and ending at 0:14.  Then we get the first half of REGGATTA DE BLANC.    REGGATTA DE BLANC, the second album of The Police, was the first indication of what the group was really capable of.  It's an excellent album which is far better than their debut.  It includes some of the band's finest work, such as \\"Message in a Bottle\\" and \\"Walking on the Moon\\", as well as some lesser-known songs like \\"Bring on the Night\\", \\"The Bed's Too Big Without You\\" and \\"No Time This Time\\".  There's also Stewart Copeland's quirky composition \\"On Any Other Day\\".  Here we have the one flaw of MESSAGE IN A BOX.  Due to the limit in running time for each CD, REGGATTA DE BLANC is split in half.  The first half, which begins with \\"Message in a Bottle\\" and ends with \\"Deathwish\\", closes off the first disc; the second half, beginning with \\"Walking on the Moon\\" and ending with \\"No Time This Time\\", opens the second disc.    Disc two is possibly the best disc of the set.  As soon as REGGATTA DE BLANC ends, we get \\"Visions of the Night\\", a B-side with abnormally furious vocals by Sting.  This is succeeded by an interesting mono version of \\"The Bed's Too Big Without You\\", which may even be superior to the album version.  Next is a live recording of \\"Truth Hits Everybody\\".  Then we have \\"Friends\\", another rare song and a particularly bizarre one.  It's about a cannibal, eerily voiced by Andy Summers.  One you've endured that song, ZENYATTA MONDATTA begins.    ZENYATTA MONDATTA is possibly the group's greatest album.  It's definitely their most balanced.  It opens with the classic \\"Don't Stand So Close to Me\\", an outstanding song with outstanding lyrics by Sting; it's possibly the band's best song.  \\"Driven to Tears\\", another excellent song, follows.  There's hardly a moments pause between that song and the great \\"When the World is Running Down, You Make the Best of What's Around\\".  \\"Canary in a Coalmine\\" is as close to a traditional reggae song as the band ever recorded.  The next two songs, the repetitive \\"Voices in My Head\\" and \\"Bombs Away\\", are not amongst the band's finest work; \\"De Do Do Do, De Da Da\\", however, is.  Andy Summers' guitar sounds especially beautiful in that song, while it sounds harsh and dry in the indstrumental \\"Behind My Camel\\".  \\"Man in a Suitcase\\" is a short, fun song of which I'm rather fond, partially because of Sting's tongue-in-cheek lyrics.  \\"Shadows in the Rain\\" is inferior to the re-recording which appeared on Sting's debut solo album.  ZENYATTA MONDATTA, and the second disc, end with \\"The Other Way of Stopping\\".    Disc three opens with the rare \\"A Sermon\\", a nice little song followed by a high-voltage live version of \\"Driven to Tears\\".  This is followed by the rare \\"Shambelle\\", which is my personal favorite of the band's instrumental pieces.  Sting's bass meshes especially well with Andy Summers' guitar in that song. After that, GHOST IN THE MACHINE begins.  It was here that the band really perfected their reggae rock; it's also the group's political album.  Most of the songs here seem rather dark and grim to me, but they're also quite good.  Especially notable on this album is the frequent use of saxophones, which really enhances the songs.  The great opener \\"Spirits in the Material World\\" is followed by one of The Police's all-time greats and classics, \\"Every Little Thing She Does is Magic\\", a sweet little romantic song that just sounds beautiful.  This is in sharp contrast to \\"Invisible Sun\\", which sounds cold and industrial, but which also ranks among the group's best songs.  \\"Hungry For You (J'Aurais Toujours Faim de Toi)\\" is sung almost entirely in French, and it's a great song.  \\"Demolition Man\\" was later remade by Sting and used in the Sylvester Stallone film of the same title.  The saxophones are especially prominent on \\"Too Much Information\\", which is followed by the catchy \\"Rehumanize Yourself\\" and the sax-heavy \\"One World (Not Three)\\".  \\"Omegaman\\", written by Andy Summers, is an excellent song which I consider to be one of the group's best.  \\"Secret Journey\\" is a cool and mysterious song.  The last song of the album, \\"Darkness\\", has a nice piano part and has an oddly claustrophobic feel to it.    The four rarities which follow are interesting, but only one is really good.  The first is the dull instrumental \\"Flexible Strategies\\", made up for by \\"Low Life\\".  Then we've two songs from the BRIMSTONE & TREACLE soundtrack: \\"How Stupid Mr. Bates\\" and the rather disturbing \\"A Kind of Loving\\".  On that rather poor note, we close the third disc.    The fourth disc is excellent, and possibly the best of the bunch.  It contains SYNCHRONICITY, the final album of The Police.  It was a major hit upon its release and is widely regarded as a classic.  Not without reason - most of the songs are flawless, and Sting's lyrics have never been better or more visually-stimulative.  The album opens with the memorable keyboard opening on \\"Synchronicity I\\".  \\"Walking in Your Footsteps\\" is a departure from the usual style of The Police, but \\"O My God\\" is classic Police.  It's hard to endure Andy Summers' shouting in \\"Mother\\", but the lyrics make it worth a try.  Stewart Copeland wrote the nice, calm \\"Miss Gradenko\\".  Everything which follows that is pure gold.  \\"Synchronicity II\\" is one of the band's best songs, an energetic piece entirely different from \\"Synchronicity I\\".  This is followed by the band's all-time biggest hit, the almost-legendary \\"Every Breath You Take\\".  Needless to say, this is one of the group's best.  \\"King of Pain\\" and \\"Wrapped Around Your Finger\\" are both among the band's very greatest songs, featuring outstanding lyrics by Sting, particularly on the latter.  \\"Tea in the Sahara\\", is a beautiful, dreamy song with a perfect vocal by Sting and some of Sting's finest lyrics ever; undoubtedly, this is one of the band's best.  SYNCHRONICITY closes with \\"Murder by Numbers\\", another tongue-in-cheek composition which stirred up some controversy when it was released.  And there ended the final album of The Police.  MESSAGE IN A BOX, however, has more to offer.    There's a nice live recording of \\"Man in a Suitcase\\".  Andy Summers gets the lead vocal part on the mega-rare \\"Someone to Talk To\\", which is definitely one of my favorite Police songs and very likely one of the group's best songs.  The live recording of \\"Message in a Bottle\\" which follows is good, but unremarkable.  \\"I Burn for You\\", originally featured on the BRIMSTONE & TREACLE soundtrack, is a beautiful, atmospheric song which also deserves a spot with the group's best work.  \\"Once Upon a Daydream\\" is an interesting, eerie, and quite good rarity, succeeded by a nice live recording of \\"Tea in the Sahara\\".  Finally, the career of The Police - and the last disc of MESSAGE IN A BOX - concludes with the infamous \\"Don't Stand So Close to Me '86\\", a revamp of the group's original hit which was the final song recorded by The Police.  I like this song, though it has a more mainstream sound than the other compositions of the group.  It goes without saying that it's far inferior to the original.    MESSAGE IN A BOX: THE COMPLETE RECORDINGS is absolutely essential for any fan of The Police.  It collects every one of the group's five albums and features a variety of highly intriguing rarities, as well as some interesting live recordings.  It makes especially apparent the fact that The Police were not just one of the greatest bands of the 80's - they were very likely one of the greatest bands of all time.  No Police fan can go without purchasing this, and I'd highly recommend it to everyone else as well.
B0001ADB8C|5.0|George Harrison intended Dark Horse Records to be part of Herb Alpert's A&M Records family.  He produced at least two records, on the Dark Horse label, and through A&M, they were: Splinter and Ravi Shankar Family and Friends.  George was a prominent musician on both works, as well as producer.  He took all the musicians who appeared on Family and Friends, and toured the US.  It was promoted as the Dark Horse tour.  After about three or four performances, George's voice was thrashed.  He came down with jaundice. The tour was in two parts: first an Indian music program, and then rock and roll.  It was panned generally.  I believe at one point George actually admonished his audience: \\"I don't know about you, but you seem pretty dead from up here.\\" There is a picture of George posing with President Gerald Ford, his son Jack, and Ravi Shankar, at the White House.  ALso, according to George's autobiography, he got into drinking heavily, his marriage broke up, he met Olivia, had a son, got married again.  <br /> The last George Harrison album to be produced by EMI was Extra Texture.  The first George harrison album to be produced on Dark Horse was Thirty Three and a Third, which has, like the Beatle's Revolver, multi-meanings: George's age was 33, an LP plays at 33 and 1/3 RPMs.  The difference, musically, spiritually, is most significant.  Extra Texture had songs that were like a funeral.  Dark, life at its ebb.  Suicidal. Thirty Three and a Third bursts with life from the first track.  And so on until Cloud Nine.  George would announce he had \\"retired\\" between each Dark Horse record.  His reasoning for doing \\"George Harrison\\", for example, was that racing car drivers had asked him if he was still recording.  SO he wrote \\"Faster\\" for them, and a fine, beautiful LP along with it.  Love songs, old Beatle songs.  It is a wonderful record.     <br />  Even Gone Troppo has a sense of lazy, sun on your face, I'm lying here on the beach of Hawaii and now let's go into the studio and do a song, eh chaps?  He was doing things at HIS pace. When He wanted.  Not when MR. RECORD COMPANY EXECUTIVE WANTED.  Actually George had a very good relation with the president of Warner Brothers Records, who originally released all of George's Dark Horse works.  He even convinced him to use recycled paper for LP covers, etc.   <br /> And it is interesting to note that, for all his complaining about The Beatles era, of all the solo Beatle record releases, George's sound most like the traditional \\"Beatle sound\\".  It has to do with his guitar playing.  That was the heart and soul of the \\"Beatle sound.\\"  Try as they may, none of the other Beatles were ever able to get a lead guitarist who could come close to measuring up to George.  SO, this is what you get from The Dark Horse Years: George, doing his music, as he wanted to, without any pressure, and when he was pressured, he wrote songs like \\"Blood From A Clone\\". It is a unique set of pop music, and singularly personal.
B00003CWPL|5.0|David Lynch's ERASERHEAD is a cult classic that has wowed, befuddled, and even angered audiences for nearly thirty years.  It was one of Stanley Kubrick's favorite films, and it impressed George Lucas to the point where he asked Lynch to direct RETURN OF THE JEDI (Lynch declined, opting to direct DUNE instead).  Still, ERASERHEAD never got much farther than cult status.  This is somewhat saddening, because the movie truly deserves more.    As with most of David Lynch's films, not a whole lot is clear here.  One can't be sure whether this is all just one big nightmare or a look at a post-apocalyptic future.  Whatever the case, this much is clear: ERASERHEAD revolves around Henry Spencer (Jack Nance), a young man with an absurd hairstyle.  Henry is in the printing service.  He was dating Mary X (Charlotte Stewart), but then she disappeared for a time.  She suddenly reappears and invites Henry to dinner with her parents (Allen Joseph and Jeanne Bates).  There, Henry discovers that Mary has given birth to a premature baby, although Mary admits that the doctors aren't sure whether it's a baby or not (!).  Mrs. X - Mary's mother - forces Henry to marry Mary.  Thus Henry deals with his moody girlfriend while taking care of his horrific baby.    If this sounds odd, or even a bit scary, you may have a hard time enduring ERASERHEAD.  It really isn't an easy movie to watch - it's filled with terrifying images and surrounded by an atmosphere of unease.  The dialogue is abnormal and weird to the point where it's frightening.  The fact that we really have no clue what the movie's about makes it even more chilling.  David Lynch has said that this movie was how he dealt with his fear of becoming a father, but neither he nor anyone else has ever disclosed any more information.  (By the way, if you're pregnant or a soon-to-be father, STEER CLEAR OF THIS MOVIE.)    The special effects, by Lynch himself, are extraodinary.  Henry's baby, no doubt the most famous (or infamous) part of the film, is absolutely horrific.  (To this day, Lynch won't even give a hint as to how the baby was made, though there's a rumor that it was made from an embalmed cow fetus.)  The black and white cinematography is exemplary, really emphasizing just how bleak and depressing this industrial world is.  The movie's soundtrack consists primarily of mechanical and industrial sounds which run throughout most of the movie, creating a sort of claustrophobic feeling.  There's also a few brief snippets of carnival-style music, as well as a great musical number performed by the \\"Lady in the Radiator\\", entitled \\"In Heaven\\".      ERASERHEAD has more in common with austere surrealist paintings than it does with other films.  Lynch succeeds in making a stylish, gruesome, depressing, horrifying, and yet shockingly beautiful movie which a meaning so deep (or non-existent) that to this day, audiences still haven't figured it out.  I was completely mesmerized throughout the film, unable to avert my attention from David Lynch's brilliant, repulsive masterpiece.  I think one can safely say that a review can not do this film justice.  The only way to really know ERASERHEAD is to watch it.  It's a film much darker and more bizarre than David Lynch's other films - after all, it's a horror/fantasy - but it still ranks amongst the master director's finest works.      One of the greatest aspects of Lynch's films is that they leave it up to you to interpret them as you will.  ERASERHEAD is no different.  It's an uncrackable enigma, ready to be interpreted in any way but impossible to truly solve.
B000AADYYO|5.0|Opeth have, for a long time, been regarded as one of the best Progressive and Melodic Death Metal acts around. And for once, it seems everyone agrees: Opeth are the greatest.    Sinse releasing their epic debut 'Orchid', Opeth have amazed audiences the world over with their singular style and diverse instrumental range.    I have owned this album ever since it first came out, but have conserved my review until i was sure that i had completely experienced the album for all it has to offer, and had memorised every single moment in it.    Opeth are, in my opinion, the greatest band out there. Mikael Akerfeldt has the kind of voice that most vocolists dream of having. While changing at lightning-fast speed from a demonic, growling, beast to a soft, sweeping, and hauntingly melodic tune, he creates a melody and rythm so complex that, after hearing the album more times i could possibly remember, it still amazes me.    What sets this album apart from Opeth's previous achievements, is that of all their previous albums, the most Opeth ever spent practicing was three days. With this album it was three weeks.    This has been the main contributer to the military-precision on this album. The drumming follows the guitar and bass PERFECTLY, so much so that the timing on Ghost Reveries could be described as magical.    The guitar-work on the album is wonderful, and more artfully done, dare i say it, than other Opeth albums. The bass is also perfectly timed and strings the album together seamlessly.    The guitar sound here is also different, richer and smoother sounding, and fits perfectly with the albums 'sound'.    Ghost Reveries is produced MUCH more than any other Opeth, and sounds more like Dream Theater. It was produced entirely by Opeth themselves. This album is so fantastic, i can barely describe the experience of listening to it. It is defenitely, without a doubt, my favourite album ever recorded. The only two thing about the album that dissapoint, just a little, are thesong 'Atonement' which has a weird middle-eastern vibe that doesn't suit the album AT ALL. And... i have long loved Mikael Akerfeldt's superb lyrics, but here they seem to drag. Although there are still some AWESOME lyrics here, like 'Isolation Years' and 'The Baying Of The Hounds'. Some of the other songs lyrics are just a bit... hollow.    Here are my reviews for the songs:    'Ghosts Of Perdition' 5 stars. An epic and extremely memorable opener that doesn't drag at all during the 10 minutes of it's length. Well lives up to it's astounding critical acclaim.    'The Baying Of The Hounds' 5 stars. Another epic, very similar to the style of Ghosts Of Perdition, but a bit more progressive and with more elements of modern metal.    'Beneath The Mire' 5 stars. A shorter, (nine minute), song that mixes beautiful melodies with extreme metal. Haunting and enchanting, it's a song you will never forget.    'Atonement' 3 1/2 stars. The only song here that is mediocre. It pains me to give it a bad score, but i have to be honest, and this song just doesn't come close to any of the other songs on Ghost Reveries. It just doesn't suit the style of the album. It's one of Opeth's worst, and there aren't many of them!    'Reverie/Harlequiem Forest' 5 stars. The longest song on the album, being 11 minutes, which is very gothic and haunting. Wondeful vocals on this song, and it ends with one of the best drum beats ever written.    'Hours Of Wealth' 5 stars. This is a jazzy and soft, completely melodic, track that flows in and out of dreamy like passages. A wondeful song, fantastic singing.    'The Grand Conjuration' 5 stars. A return to the epic styling of Ghosts Of Perdition and The Baying Of The Hounds. The cut down version is the only single off the album. Wonderful moments throughout the song, with catchy and precise chorus lines. Sadly, this song has perhaps the worst Opeth lyrics ever.    'Isolation Years' 5 stars. Probably the best closer for an album that i have ever heard. This is the song that, after writing, Akerfeldt decided to create a half concept, half not, album. Wonderful lyrics and melodic singing.    So, as a summary, i would advise ANYONE to buy this album, because it is truly something you will not forget. This is Opeth at their very most talented and precise. It showcases perfectly their wonderful musical abilities and displays the band in their very element. Ghost Reveries is even better than 'My Arms, Your Hearse' which is Opeth's third album and one of their heaviest. This album shows what Opeth truly are: Masters of Music.    Just from one listen of any Opeth album, it's obvious that, unlike most bands out today, they truly understand music, and they know how to write songs that never get boring or lag, no matter how long they go for.

0060573775|5.0|Slaughterhouse Five is a great book, though Vonnegut's habit of skipping around in time, though really effective, makes it difficult to see where the story is going.  The book is semi-autobiographical, originating in Vonnegut's own experience as an Allied POW who survived the bombing of Dresden by sheer luck--he was imprisoned in a slaughterhouse storage room that protected him and saved his life.      The skipping around in time gives one the feeling that Vonnegut is having a hard time dealing with his experience, he is having a hard time focusing and therefore drifts off to other memories.  It's only in the latter section of the book when the main character, Billy Pilgrim, goes through the bombing of Dresden himself does the book come together.  Taken as a whole, the scattered memories tell the life story of Billy Pilgrim, which is really cool, though it would have been nice to have known this from the get go.  The second time around every detail made sense, every detail had its place.  There's also a fair amount of very dark humor in the book.    Also, although the book doesn't seem so shocking today, when it was written, the horrors of the bombing of Dresden were not widely known in the US.  He compares the bombing to a nuclear attack, which is quite rightly justified by the casualty and destruction statistics.  Offhand comments are also sometimes a little racy.  This apparently caused the book to be banned from many school libraries when it first came out, though by today's standards it's hard to see what the prudes were fussing about.    Two other points:  1) Vonnegut never mentions that the bombing of Dresden was the Allies payback for the senseless bombing and destruction of a 300 year old Dutch city called Rotterdam.  Vonnegut should be shot for not mentioning Rotterdam.  2) Ethan Hawk does a great job reading.  I wish more top actors recorded books.
1567184855|5.0|This book is a real eye-opener. I have spent years reading, studying and practicing various spiritual work, and I have to say that by the end of this book my perspective had definitely been able to make a shift. Much of this information has also been mentioned in various other new agey books, but there was something remarklably profound for me in the matter-of-fact presentation given by these clients under hypnosis. It really resonated with me, and has allowed me a much broader viewpoint to live from today. I cannot more highly recommend this book, if you are thinking about it.... it is well worth the read.
0060922583|5.0|William of Occam never intended for his idea to be used in the manner a certain pseudo-skeptic reviewer (March 27 2006) uses it.  Certainly, Newton's theory of gravity is simpler than Einsteins, but that doesn't make it more correct.  Also, the decision regarding which theory is \\"simpler\\" is completely subjective.  One person could have an easier time comprehending one theory over another and a second person could have the opposite view.  Appealing to the view that \\"simpler is better in every circumstance\\" is a very dogmatic reflex for philosophical materialists.  Even if, in some hypothetical world, everyone agreed that one theory was simpler than another that doesn't mean anything.  The simpler view probably is simpler because it ignores any anomalous data, which is not scientific at all.  This book explores all the data that doesn't fit with the current scientific paradigm of steel ball like subatomic particles devoid of consciousness and offers a theory that could explain it.  In writing this book, Michael Talbot is following in the tradition of Galileo's Dialogue on the Two Chief World Systems, or Darwin's Origin of Species, challenging the status quo because it falls far from explaining the way things are.<br /><br />Also, anecdotal evidence/personal testimony is absolutely valid.  If it were not there would be hundreds of killers and rapists running around instead of in prison where they belong, all because the courts refused to accept the testimony of eye witnesses.  I for one am glad the justice system doesn't have such impossibly high standards.  Or, as Winston Wu put it:<br />\\"One argument I use that always gets these skeptics goes like this.  I ask them about a country they've never been to before, such as France for example.

After all, the photos, videos, and souvenirs from that country could all be forgeries, you just don't know do you?\\"  The skeptic will usually reply with \\"But I can fly to France and verify that it exists.\\"  And that answer totally misses the point, so I then counter with the key question \\"Yeah but UNTIL you go to France, do you assume for NOW that it doesn't exist, based on your skeptical philosophy that anecdotal evidence is invalid?\\"  That stumps them EVERYTIME!

B0002OERI0|1.0|I'll kick and scream and bite and punch for my views on this unbelievably overrated album.  Green Day has taken a downhill/sellout route ever since their debut, also their only good effort; Dookie showed creativity, Insomniac had some worth with a few good singles, but the rest of their discography is unoriginal and repetitive.  American Idiot is a perfect example.  None of the four big hits ('American Idiot, Holiday, Boulevard, Wake/September') show the slightest trace of imagination.  The music is forced, repetitive, and lacks the energy that the band had at the begging of their career.  How `Wake Me Up...' is compared with `Jeremy' and `Teen Spirit,' I'll never know.  The idea of the `Jesus of Suburbia' punk opera would have a descent amount of value if the music itself had any actual worth.  Maybe I loathe this album so much because everyone calls this a timeless classic and categorizes it with Hybrid Theory and Mezmerize/Hypnotize as one of the best of the new millennium.  Again, why is this album rated so highly?  Maybe I would rate this disgrace for a punk album a bit higher had it not been for all these misguided listeners,saying that American Idiot is just as good as Nevermind and Mellon Collie from the Nineties.  I just don't see how such a poor album in terms of musical quality can even be mentioned in the same sentence as The Blue Album or The Colour and the Shape; epics like these have singles that actually sound different from one another.  Much like Nimrod and Warning before it, a horrid display of fake, wannabe punk from a band who seriously needs to consider retirement.
B000078DOI|5.0|If you ask any Red Hot Chili Peppers fan what their favorite RHCP album is, almost 100% of the time the response will be a quick and resounding \\"Blood Sugar Sex Magik\\". I have yet to find anyone to agree with me, but for the Chili's best work, I think one must look one album back from BSSM to \\"Mother's Milk\\". I have been frequently maligned by other Chili Peppers fans, but I will try to make my case. This is the first album featuring the current line-up; John Frusciante had stepped up to the plate to take over for the recently decease guitarist Hillel Slovak, and Chad Smith took over for Jack Irons who had gone M.I.A. \\"Mother's Milk\\" marks the beginning of the band feeling each other out, and really experimenting and playing off of each other. I would argue that this is their most diverse collection. RHCP are often praised for thier zany combination of punk and funk, but this is their last album where they really have any sort of semblance of \\"punk\\", whether it be in sound, look, or attitude. Starting on \\"BSSM\\", the Peppers started experimenting with melody and contemporary, conventional song structures, but on \\"Mother's Milk\\", everything rips and tears like the end of the world is tomorrow. The cover tunes, \\"Higher Ground\\" by Stevie Wonder (which was RHCP's signature song early in their career) and  <br />\\"Fire\\" by Jimi Hendrix, are spot on while simultaneously being personalized by RHCP. Other standouts include the quirky \\"Subway to Venus\\", showcasing Flea on trumpet, The furious punk/ metal numbers \\"Nobody Weird Like Me\\" and \\"Punk Rock Classic\\", the epics \\"Johnny Kick a Hole in The Sky\\" and \\"Knock Me Down\\", the cover songs, and \\"Sexy Mexican Maid\\" which is funky as all hell. Before John Frusciante came off of his heroin addled stupor and decided to write terrible ballads, he was a demon on the guitar. This album features some of his best work. If you want to hear RHCP at their best, you couldn't go wrong with \\"Mother's Milk\\".
B000AMJDHY|4.0|Much more enjoyable than I expected it to be.  I am not quite sure why this alternative band (key word alternative) has this Fall Out Boy (a pop-punk band) knock off tag attached to it every time someone mentions their name;  I hear a great deal more creativity in A Fever You Can't Sweat Out than From Under the Cork Tree.  Not a ground-breaking record by a long shot, but it shows signs of greatness from a young band with a LOT of potential.  The first four tracks are excellent, with the funky `Nails for Breakfast, Tacks for Snacks' taking the lead.  Afterwards, the album gets a little weaker, but still has bright spots in the preachy `Build God, then We'll Talk' and the soon-to-be MTV video classic `I Write Sins Not Tragedies.'  I compare Panic!'s debut to Introduce Yourself from FNM-not that Panic! At the Disco will be looking for a new vocalist anytime soon, but I compare the musical impact of the album.  Both albums debut a band with massive potential, both have their share of exceptional tracks, both have their share of filler, and (most importantly) both leave us waiting to hear what's next.  Hey, it'd  be awesome if Panic! followed FNM's career path-The Real Thing and Angel Dust are descent.  (Just kidding-they are two of the best albums ever.)  Overall, I was quite impressed with Panic! At the Disco's unique blend of Incubus-like guitars riffs and Linkin Park-like synthesizers.  A good effort from a band that could be the next big thing.
B00000JG41|5.0|If black was white and up was down, Mr. Bungle's \\"California\\" would be regarded as the finest pop album of all time. Lush harmonies and brilliant, accesible guitar lace the album. However, there is something a little bit \\"different\\" about this collection. Amidst the pop perfection and outrageous melodies, there is an underlying sense of evil. Minor chords, bizarre instruments, unconventional song structures, and vurtuosic musicianship are the order of the day here. Equal parts Radiohead and Beach Boys smashed together with Slayer and the end of the world itself; Mr. Bungle's \\"California\\" is a complete contradiction. Unconvetnion has never sounded so conventional; Bungle finally found a way to channel their bizarre vision into digestible packages. This is not to say that I dislike \\"Mr. Bungle\\" or \\"Disco Volante\\" (I love both), but this is Patton's crowning achievement. He hadn't created anything this perfect before the album, and with the strange vocal direction he is seeming to be taking, he probably never will. Here is a rundown of the tracks: <br /> <br />1. 'Sweet Charity'- The sound of waves breaking on a beach and the low squawking of gulls marks the intro of the album's opener. Then, Patton unleashes one of the album's best melodies mixing lounge crooning with nonsensical lyrics. One of the best tracks. <br /> <br />2. 'None of Them Knew They Were Robots'- A clever tune with a clever title. The track is opened by manic drumming and strumming, which gives way to Patton's vocals and a horn section. This, in turn, is followed by some dark surf-rock for good measure. Great, catchy chorus in this one. <br /> <br />3. 'Retrovertigo'- An absolutely gorgeous, slow-paced pop gem that wouldn't sound out of place on Radiohead's \\"OK Computer\\". <br /> <br />4. 'Air Conditioned Nightmare'- One of the albums more \\"old-sounding\\" Bungle songs due to its more unconventional sound and rapid song structure changes. Possibly my favorite track. Great lyrics. <br /> <br />5. 'Ars Moriendi'- Another crazy song mixing middle eastern percussion with crazy bursts of grindcore and metal. However, even this dissonance cannot mask the beautiful melodies to be found here. <br /> <br />6. 'Pink Cigarette'- A \\"love song\\" with satirical, ironic lyrics and an over the top vocal performance from Patton. Very creative. <br /> <br />7. 'Golem II: The Bionic Vapour Boy'- A bizarre tune mixing strange, electronic vocal effects with synthesizers, funk, callypso, and strange computer noises. There are also passages where noise seems to be generated from children's toys, but I could be wrong.  <br /> <br />8. 'The Holy Filament'- A really menacing tune punctuated by keyboard, some tambourine, and fantastic melodic arrangements from Patton. Another of the albums standouts; this one has a real \\"epic\\" sound to it. <br /> <br />9. 'Vanity Fair'- One of the most straightforward tracks on the album features a catchy du-wop melody and a nice chorus. At less than three minutes, this is \\"California\\"'s shortest cut. <br /> <br />10. 'Goodbye Sober Day'- A real surprise. I was totally thrown off by this one as it is THE craziest song Bungle has ever done despite being on the groups most \\"sane\\" album. Words cannot describe this song. My personal favorite. <br /> <br />If you are a fan of real music and you can appreciate music as an art form as opposed to music as a cash cow, you really owe it to yourself to check out \\"California\\" by Mr. Bungle. It is simply brilliant, and there may not be another album like this ever again. <br /> <br />
B000EMGAOY|1.0|Horrible.  There is no better word to describe this over-hyped nonsense.  What happened to these guys?  2 discs?  They must be kidding.  This is an EP at best.  They have lost their \\"stones\\" completely.  They should take the socks off their d*@ks and put them over their other head.  It sucks!
B000F48CD8|5.0|Jack White, one half of the White Stripes, is back with a side band who's first project is this wonderful debut album. White and company have delievered exactly what I wanted from the newest \\"super group\\". Jack is back with the alt. rock i so dearly missed and loved. Get Behind Me Satan, the latest album from the Stripes lacked in the \\"rock\\" department. It's not that i didn't love the album (it was my second fav. of last year) It's just that evereything White seems to do is great and you'll crave for more. I'm sure in a few months I'll be hoping for another piano/bango/zylophone/triangle album from the detroit music man. now on to this record :  <br /> <br />Steady As She Goes- 9/10- the song that introduced me to the Racounteurs. It is a great song that will get stuck in your head. Will be one of, if not the best singles of the season, perhaps the year. <br /> <br />Hands-8/10-a love song perhaps writen after White's recent marrage. Either way it is very good with a  killer ending. <br /> <br />Broken Boy Soilder-9.5/10-White's vocals illuminate in this track with wonderful rythem-guitar. My 2nd favorite of the album. <br /> <br />Intimate Secretary-8.5/10-the most led-zepplein sounding on the album (a band the stripes are often compared to) with a chorus that has sing-along type lyrics. With some classic White Vocal tricks. <br /> <br />Together-8/10 Has my favorite line of the album \\"you've got to learn to live and live and learn\\" the way the line is song made we smile for a very long time. Any way: another love song that heads warning to the significant other <br /> <br />Level-8/10-a just straight on \\"rock it\\" song from the band and it works well With some very catchy guitar work. <br /> <br />Store Bought Bones-8.5/10- the B-side to the Steady As She Goes single. It is a very good song with some good work by Keeler and an amazingly simplictic chorus <br /> <br />Yellow Sun-8/10 With a muddled beginning it becomes a feel good song with some fun lyrics. Just anoverall very fun sound. <br /> <br />Call it a day-7/10-The first time i heard it i was loving the histerical background vocals. i'm not sure if they weren't meant for comic relief but that's how it works. This seems less White-oriented and it shows. <br /> <br />Blue Veins-10/10-Easily my favorite song on the album. It's a powerful blues ballad with powerful lead vocals from jack. It's easily one of my favorite blues/white/all time/ songs ever. <br /> <br />
B000000OPZ|2.0|Well past their peak. Even though most, if not all, of the original WS musos had gone they still had to re-cycle the songs with guitar solos high on the ol'treble control.  <br /> <br />What is worse there is no Moody slide, the killer decision is getting any WS album.
0375831002|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. I find it hard to believe that the author is just 32 years old. He writes with a maturity and depth of feeling that belies his age and his place of birth. We've been in many wars (Australia) but except for a few bombs on Darwin, we have never experienced anything like the horrific bombing of German cities in the closing months of the war. Markus Zusak's family have indeed shown him \\"another side\\". <br />Thankyou Markus, You tell it like my German in-laws say it was. <br />It's time someone did!
B000F48CD8|2.0|Why does everything have to be so great nowadays? Every movie is \\"a heart stopping thrill ride\\", every book a pulitzer, every new band is the next Led Zeppelin. Fifteen minutes of fame has been weened down to fifteen seconds in my mind. Jack & company sound tired and laboured on this album. Is it supposed to be a pop album? Sounds more like prog rock with hints of pop. I read somewhere that they were trying to make their version of \\"Nevermind\\". Well, nevermind.  If this band didn't have Jack White in it nobody would give two turds. I'm puttin' these songs in the recycled bin of my computer, right next to Wolfmother.
B00005YW4H|5.0|My friend at work plays this cd every day, after a while I just had to get this album. I already knew all the songs inside and out before I unwrapped the cd. I find this album to be very uplifting, yet relaxing. I can't pick a favorite, because I like all the songs. It is a nice mix of pop, jazz and more. Norah Jones has such a beautiful wispy voice, I never tire of. I am going to get more of her albums.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|Talent is the ante. Many have it. What you do with it is what matters. Emmylou Harris and Mark Knopfler are blue-collar workers. They take their immense natural talent, put it to the side and roll up their sleeves, building songs like brick walls --- a note at a time. As the notes pile up, they sound effortless, eternal, as if they could have been served up in no other way. Which is why Knopfler and Harris's CDs feel like houses: solid, honest, as permanent as anything mortals can create.<br /><br />They're houses in another way too --- as places of refuge. Put a Knopfler or Harris CD on, and the world feels right. His sure slow hand, cousin to J.J. Cale, a fluid contrast to his refreshingly non-professional voice. The angelic clarity of her voice, cutting and floating, suspended in time and space, as close to perfection as we'll know in this life.<br /><br />Together, there's nothing they can't do: iron strength, gossamer delicacy, you name it.<br /><br />\\"All the Roadrunning\\" is everything you could possibly want. A \\"ten best,\\" desert-island disc. Background music. A throwaway collection of tunes for the road. A fan might say, with deep pleasure, \\"I've waited seven years for this.\\" But the truth is, we've been waiting all our lives. And so have Knopfler and Harris.
0375751513|5.0|The only novel by Oscar Wilde. This is one of my favourite novels together with The Great Gatsby by Scott Fitzgerald and Animal Farm by George Orwell, also Hi Fi by Nick Hornby and Los Adioses by Onetti and others, but The Picture of Dorian Gray is a success when you give the students a reader at school.
B000BJS4SU|5.0|Take note folks...........John Mayer and his new trio are easily the next SRV, Hendrix, Clapton, or whomever you covet. This kid is leaving the teen-idol-angst world and has entered into living legend. Its about time he chooses to show the world what he is capable of and he's only scraped the tip of the iceburg on this album. Those of you who've seen him live three to four times know what I mean. This album is a fantastic first step and hopefully he'll churn out fifty more just like it or better! I am definitely a new \\"Mayer Faithful.\\"  <br />
0553565915|4.0|This book is indeed one of the most detailed  accounts of a near death experience that I have ever read.What Ms.Eadie was able to remember and recount is pretty amazing.I don't agree with every last single thing in the book, but most of it rang very true for me.I  also enjoyed the Author's relatable , personal, unpretentious writing style in dealing with such a subject. Even if you don't totally  believe or agree with the core message of the book, I believe that you will still find it enjoyable and uplifting.
0060872675|3.0|\\"Where is my cow\\" is an illustrated book for very small Children (2-3 years old?). And it is a collection book for Terry Pratchett Fans. If you have kids and want to introduce them to T.P and reading, this book is sweet and can be used to share time together. If you collect pratchett books this will be a simple object for your library. Cant say it's not ok, simply depends on what you are looking for. It's a child book or a collection Object, nothing more, nothing less. Even if i do possess much more interesting Pratchett Collection things.
0385336691|4.0|I found the latest entry from the mind of Mr. Child terrific - as always the fluidity and creativity of his stories and characters are precise and potent. <br /> <br />The one thing I miss from Mr. Child is the attention to forensic detail of military weaponry etc...Although I have nothing to do with the Armed Forces, I always find it exciting when those descriptions are paid close attention. They are present here, I just would've liked more. <br /> <br />Lastly, and I must admit, but I missed all the vivid (and I mean VIVID) details when Mr. Reacher opens a can of his whoop___. on the 'bad guys'. Fans will definitely know what I mean by this. I am not an advocate of violence -- but no one writes it better than Lee. <br /> <br />So to this day, if anyone asks where to start, I will always say \\"PERSUADER\\" : that novel is sheer genius....and one of the all-time greatest first-chapters ever written. I defy anyone to disagree with me on that. <br /> <br />Onward Mr. Child!
B000AQBA1W|4.0|Generally, I find Corrs albums to be a hit & miss affair. Some great tracks and some mediocre. But this is one that they really deliver on. Every track is beautifully polished and has an updated feel whilst still remaining true to the originals. Yes, it is an Irish-Trad album but it is not only this, it is good songs, beautifully delivered. If you love or even have a casual liking for Irish music, you should buy this album.
0316172324|4.0|Next time Malcolm Gladwell writes a book, I will buy it without blinking. I have read his Tipping point and this is his second book I read. I truly respect this author for the way he presents his ideas. Coginitive science is presented in the form of a story book. He debates throughout the book if we should follow our gut-feeling or not. There are times when this have proven right and sometimes it has proven wrong. There are some good examples of how instincts may not be always right : as in sipping Pepsi and deciding if it is better than Coke, listening to one song by an artist and deciding if he is good or bad. There are no conclusions drawn whatsoever. If you are looking at core Cognitive science as in \\"science\\", then this is not the book for you. This book has more examples than explanation of human behavior.     All in all, it is a very light read. I agree with a reviewer who says it leaves you hungry, looking for more than what you read and an explanation of why we do what we do.
B0007Y08QA|5.0|'The Machinist' is easily one of the best films I have seen in a long time.  So, of course, critics and viewers seem to be lukewarm or downright critical of it.  Maybe it was too dark for them.  Maybe it was too confusing.  Maybe a protagonist that looks like a walking skeleton was too much for them to handle.  Still, the main criticisms I've read about 'The Machinist' are the very reasons people like myself love it.  The 2-star review from \\"A. Vegan\\" says it all:     \\"The movie doesn't let you know what is happening until the last few minutes of the film, so it requires that you sit through almost an hour and a half wondering what is going on. The dark gloomy atmosphere, together with the dark gloomy characters in the film help make it even more unpleasant. We know something is going on, but there is no hint of it until the movie is over.\\"    That's not really a valid criticism since that was kind of the point: to figure out what is going on.  You truly are immersed into the shoes of the protagonist (Christian Bale, in a career defining performance.)  The viewer feels just as lost, confused, and helpless as sleepy, skinny Trevor Reznik does.  Which, as my vegan friend didn't quite grasp, is part of the point of this film and is the main storytelling device.  You are supposed to feel the pain and anguish of a man who has not slept in a year and is slowly but surely losing his mind.  You may or may not enjoy the plot and subject matter, but you cannot deny that the film succeeds wonderfully in what it is attempting.    Throughout the film, I found myself asking many of the same questions Reznik was asking himself: Why can't he sleep?  What's the deal with the mysterious Ivan?  Are his co-workers really messing with him or is Trevor just paranoid?  Why is it always 1:30 when he looks at a clock?  How do the hooker and the waitress fit into everything?  Above all else....what's in the fridge?  Thankfully most, if not all, of your questions are answered in the spectacular ending that makes all of the puzzle pieces fit together nicely.  It will surprise you, but not in the typical Hollywood gimmicky \\"Gotcha!\\" kind of way (M. Night Shamalyan, I'm looking at you.)  It is both surprising and satisfying.    If you can't handle movies where the plot isn't spoon fed to you and you're pretty much in the dark until the last 5 minutes, then you probably won't enjoy 'The Machinist'.  If you enjoy movies that provide a good slow boil instead of a greasy flash fry, then you don't want to miss this instant classic.
B000BCKFWK|2.0|This movie is the most disguisting pile of manure I've ever  been sujected to.I gave it two stars only because Amazon policy mandates that every product reviewed receive at least 1 star,the second star is for,the all to brief appearence of,the beautiful and exciting Rosario Dawson.
B000EWBKM6|5.0|Just finished watching the show with friends and talking about it over dinner. Loved it. I really, really loved it. And I was happy that everyone ends up with the life they deserved all along. And how about that duet between Megan Mullally and Sean Hayes?!! It was beautiful, and I was bummed to see that its not for sale on iTunes. <br /> <br />Recently, 'Six Feet Under' finished off with the best series finale I'd seen since the final episode of 'Mary Tylor Moore,' and I was just as happy with this episode. The last few had been pretty bad so I was a little worried about how it would turn out. <br /> <br />Thanks for all these wonderful years, guys. I'm really going to miss you.
B0000025FG|3.0|Being a no-longer-young person, it's safe for me to admit that when I grew up, my late '70s/early '80s musical influences were the Alan Parsons Project, Blue Oyster Cult, Cheap Trick, ELO, and Styx. I...don't know what I was thinking with that last one. I mean...\\"Mr. Roboto\\"? Domo arigato, indeed.<br /><br />At any rate, back in the day, I jammed to just about every single ELO album ever released, and lately I've taken to spinning up some of their CDs once again. Just this past month, I finally got my hands on \\"Discovery\\", which I haven't heard in probably 15 years or more, ever since I ditched the ol' turntable and boxed up my vinyl LPs.<br /><br />Had it held up well? No. ELO was never really the rockingest group around; they were far more of a pop act, and Jeff Lynne's longings to be the fifth (non-psychedelic) Beatle are well-known. But previously they had managed to keep reasonably clear of disco influences. Here, they gave in just a little bit too much. (And later they would entirely abandon all resistance in their contributions to the soundtrack to \\"Xanadu\\", one of the greatest Olivia Newton John rollerskating movies ever made.)<br /><br />There are a couple of fairly strong numbers on this album. ELO, of course, had a bit of a hit with \\"Don't Bring Me Down\\". And the opener, \\"Shine a Little Love\\", has a nicely zippy percussive beat (right down to the handclaps). \\"Last Train to London\\" also drives along relatively spiffily. \\"Need Her Love\\" is a romantic little ballad with a bit of poignancy, the kind of song of love and longing at which Lynne excels.<br /><br />Most of the remaining songs range from ill-conceived to mediocre. What will probably make or break the album for the individual listener, though, is \\"The Ballad of Horace Wimp\\". You'll either find it extra-corny but goofily sweet, or wretched and gagtastic.<br /><br />ELO would bounce back later with their concept album \\"Time\\", which is far superior to \\"Discovery\\". But here we see the beginning of the end, as the group begins to lose focus and cave into the trends of the day, and no one is capable of reigning in Lynne's more saccharine and openly commercial tendencies. Pick this up if you have completist compulsions and you want every ELO album ever; otherwise, give it a pass, unless your tolerance for disco flavorings is high.
B0007R4TAS|5.0|Of all the actresses who have attempted this role, belated congratulations to Miss Susannah York for alone understanding \\"Jane\\" to the core, a knowledge absolutely necessary to render the character in a manner that Miss Bronte herself would assuredly recognize and approve.    No other film actress has achieved Jane's self possession, self reliance, modesty, and self control in a way that consistently points to the novel itself, rather than some film director's misguided attempts to deliver a trivialized cartoon cut out. And it is these attributes that render Miss York's treatment of Jane's deeply held emotions all the more affecting, since they are kept under lock and key.    In short, Miss York appears to have read the novel.    Some other actresses have come somewhat close, (Joan Fontaine) while others have evidently had no conception of what on earth they were doing (Virginia Bruce).    Suffice it to say that up to now, Susannah York has bested all others. As Mr. Roderick, George C. Scott is too old, but turns in a serviceable performance otherwise.    Plaudits also to the cinematography for achieving a truly romantic bleakness comparable the paintings of Caspar David Friederich. Delbert Mann understood the importance of landscape to this story, (another key attribute jettisoned in other versions) and for this he is to be congratulated.    Finally, the sumptuous and unforgettable score of John Williams. Forget hackneyed \\"Star Wars\\"--for this is a score of genuine musical achievement, richly romantic, stirring and melancholic all at the same time, not to mention being eminently listenable on its own terms.    Three cheers to all concerned in this A-1 production.
0307277674|1.0|. . . I didn't want to write this review, but enough of my students and friends have asked me about this book that, as an educator and a theologian, I must comment.<br /><br />From an historical point of view:  I agree with Tom Hanks' self-assessment.  This is hooey.  The \\"Priory of Sion\\" is a well-documented 20th century fraud.  (Well-documented by SECULAR experts).  There is an organization called \\"Opus Dei\\" -- but the similarity between Dan Brown's invention and reality ends there.  The Council of Nicaea did meet -- but didn't do what Brown implies.  NONE OF THESE ARE MY OPINIONS, THEY ARE EASILY VERIFIABLE FACTS!<br /><br />From a theological point of view:  This is nothing more than a vicious attack on the Church (a Church which Dan Brown openly and categorically despises).<br /><br />From a literary point of view:  This is a poorly written, poorly researched book.  If this is what passes for \\"good fiction writing\\" in an academic sense -- then the American novel is a rapidly dying genre.<br /><br />Look, the main reason this book has become the bestseller that it is, is due to the controversy surrounding it.  And the bashing of Christianity in general, and Catholicism in particular, is the last acceptable prejudice in society today. (Can you imagine a similar work attacking Judaism?  Or Islam?  Remember what happened when Salmon Rushdie wrote \\"The Satanic Verses\\"?)<br /><br />If you are interested in integrity (regardless of your religious persuasion) avoid.
B000AP2ZDK|5.0|Much like MF DOOM's Special Herbs and Spices collection, here J Dilla rounds up 31 great hip-hop sound bytes, with extremely limited rap that you MUST hear. Although this album has the most abrupt changes between tracks found in any album to date, which can throw many off into thinking they have bought an album that didn't get recorded properly, this is just a great experimental method of producing something unique, that could have sounded like [...], if it wasn't for J Dilla choosing the best selection of sounds heard outside of a Dan the Automator album. There are some kickin' beats here and if you are interested in the alternative Hip-Hop that is certainly the future of this genre, then make sure that you get Donuts at all costs. This album is fire.

B000DWMN2S|2.0|Regrettably, I saw the movie before I read the book. DO NOT make the same mistake. While the movie in and of itself is enjoyable, it doesn't even come close to capturing the sheer glory of the novel. So don't go out of your way to see this film, but you absolutely must read the book.

B000EWBKM6|5.0|Of course that was the title of the one hour retrospective that preceeded the one hour Series Finale that, in my opinion, wrapped up the eight years so perfectly. To end the series the same way it began in March of 1998, (I still can't believe it. Where has the time gone?!)with Will & Grace talking to each other on the phone while watching ER was just so befitting. I thought that the duet with Karen and Jack was incredible and believe that it will be the most \\"Unforgettable\\" moment of the whole series. With the fresh & outstanding writing, and incredible acting talents of Will & Grace now gone, Thursday nights are just a little less \\"must see\\". This DVD is a MUST have not just for Will & Grace fans, but for the simple fact that there will never be another show like it.

B000002G30|5.0|The song Dopes to Infinity is worth the price of the cd alone. That has to be the best Monster Magnet tune. And all of their songs are tight and therefore its no surprise that every song here is gold. It you like any other MM cd at all, then I don''t see how you could not like this. Its absolute cosmic rock.
B000BT97AO|3.0|As a long-time comics fan who's followed  Gaiman ever since he re-imagined \\"Black Orchid,\\" I'm quite familiar with his strengths and weaknesses. Strength: prodigious imagination. Weakness: anti-climactic third acts. Gaiman seems to have a tendency to get so enraptured by the mood created when the protagonist achieves Zen-like self-awareness that he's loathe to disturb that meditative calm. As a result, the resolution to too many of his stories is the revelation that there never was any conflict to begin with. The jeopardy was just anxiety, the villain was just one's own self-doubt -- in fact, there wouldn't have been any story at all if the protagonist had simply taken their Prozac.  <br /> <br />However, I felt that Gaiman's role here was closer to that of an adhesive -- as too often-happens in artist-driven comics, the story felt like a lightly-considered afterthought to rationalize the essentially random order of the dramatic images. And yes, this was very, very much the filmed vision of Dave McKean, who's surrealist use of mixed media in comics always seems, to me anyhow, to hint at depths it doesn't truly have. You look at one of his \\"Sandman\\" covers and wonder, \\"Why is this stick next to this teakettle? Why is the telephone on top of a hat? What does the chandelier made of dolls' feet symbolize?\\" My only conclusions too often were, \\"Well, it's certainly weird like, y'know, the story. I guess that's how it ties in.\\"  <br /> <br />McKean can sure concoct some intensely dreamlike vistas, fully realized here for the big screen, but I was ultimately let down by the degree to which the bizarre creatures were created in CGI rather than muppetry. Why work with Henson when any old FX shop would have done just as well? I can't help but think that had Jim Henson still been alive, an all-muppet and practical-FX version of this film which truly echoed \\"Dark Crystal\\" (as the filmmakers claim they wished to do) would have resulted. Instead, I felt that McKean fell in love with his first rough sketches and showed up at the studio to say, \\"I want it to look just like my drawings, so break out the computers. Why do we even have to use puppets?\\" Well, Dave, because it puts a human performance behind every living thing on screen, humans who can interact with the actors portraying human characters on the set in real time, and create that theatrical frisson missing when actors -- miming in solitude in front of a green screen -- never even meet the animators slaving away at their desks.
020530902X|5.0|Everyone learns to write.  Few people learn to write well anymore.  Pick up a newspaper or magazine or peruse a blog and you'll find competent but formulaic writing.  Journalists pound out their essays by formula, using standard sets of tricks time after time.  The result is dreary prose.  You read an article and you may get the point, but you don't get inspired.  You don't want to leap out of your chair, share your new learning with your friends, or change the world.  Today's writing lacks that special flare that newspapers had in earlier generations.<br /><br />We've diagnosed the disease.  The Elements of Style is the cure.  Within 87 pages, it holds all of the essentials.  Common grammar and usage mistakes, basics of sentence structure, paragraph organization.  This stuff may seem indisepnsible, but high school English teachers and college composition professors don't teach it any more.  I'm an editor; I see stack after stack of manuscripts from young would-be authors who don't understand what good prose is.<br /><br />Whenever possible, I recommend that they buy a copy of Strunk and White.  This little gem contains all the rules.  More importantly, William Strunk wrote with a concise, commanding stlye.  Today's style guides are filled with vague, spineless advice, phrased as recommendations rather absolutes.  Strunk gave orders.  \\"Enclose non-restrictive clauses in commas.\\"  \\"Don't write sentences of only one paragraph.\\"  \\"Omit unnecessary words.\\"  If you want to see your work published, buy this book.
B00006L83N|5.0|I also reviewed V by the same artist, but I'll repeat one of the themes from that review in this one: I am a classically trained clarinetist who happens to like metal and other assorted hard rock.<br /><br />This album fully rocks. While V opened with an orchestrated prelude that I felt was nice, I like the fact that Inferno (Unleash the Fire) is the opening track. From the opening riffs of this piece, you know it's going to be raw and edgy.  When they kick into their verse theme, you just want to grit your teeth and nod your head to the odd meter of this piece.<br /><br />The first hint you get of the orchestral side of Symphony X on this album is Incantations of the Apprentice, with the ominous horn and trombone intro. In the liner notes, they indicate that this has nods to Dukas' Sorcerer's Apprentice, which is a very nice touch.  The chorus to this piece has a great buildup and rhythm to it.<br /><br />Accolade II is a nice follow-up to the original Accolade on The Divine Wings of Tragedy. I really like how they almost included the \\"Marian\\" theme from the original Accolade.  It was a nice way to tie the two pieces together.<br /><br />King of Terrors just SHREDS.  Very worthy of the great build-up at the beginning of the piece.  I was surprised to learn that this was a tribute to the Pit and the Pendulum, though as I listened to the lyrics, and especially the Vincent Price-esque interlude, it came clear. The raw guitars on this piece really make it rock.<br /><br />Awakenings was one of the pieces that opened my eyes to the musical depth of which Symphony X is capable.  This song is very akin to Metallica's One, with its start in a very quiet, reflective way, though Symphony X's is far more introspective.  However, the lyrical content of this song hit me far faster than any of the other songs on the album.  I can listen to and be engaged by this song at so many different levels, it's phenomenal.<br /><br />I'd like to skip forward to Masquerade, which was the bonus track on this album.  Now, many longtime fans of these guys will likely recognize this track from their debut album.  This was one of the first albums I had heard from Symphony X, and I had not heard this song until now.  THIS ONE IS JUST AWESOME!!!!  Like another reviewer said, the lyrical line of this song is very like Queen with the harmonies and style of singing. However, the complex time-changes of this piece really reflect the virtuosity of Symphony X.  The intro really won me over, with Romeo even taking one of the baroque lines on his guitar.  Just a very stellar introduction to a very stellar piece!<br /><br />The title track to this great album, The Odyssey, really must be listened to in order to really appreciate it.  The opening orchestration may be electronic, but it comes the closest I've ever heard to the real thing, and it is really beautiful! Elements of Gavorkna meet with John Williams to craft what could definitely be the opening to a movie.  You can really see the camera moving very quickly over the surface of the ocean as Rullo's hi-hat and the strings and high woodwinds start up.  They just did a great job. The lyrics are compelling and will cause you to return to what you learned about and loved reading in school with Homer's Odyssey.  Like another reviewer said, the finale is really amazing.  You just want to jump up and shout along with the lyrics, TRIUMPHANT CHAMPION OF ITHACA.  Especially once you remember what Odysseus went through to return to his throne and queen.<br /><br />This is the album I always hoped someone would make.  I love Classical and I love Metal.  What metal musicians need to remember is how much they owe to Classical music when it comes to their melody-driven riffs.  Symphony X revels in that influence and pay a very awesome tribute to it.  If some of the great classical composers came to this time, this is the type of music I think they would like to experiment with.ns of these guys will likely recognize this track from their debut album.

0307277674|3.0|I read this book a couple of years ago, and now that the movie is out, the hype is back. I thought the book was just OK, nothing more and wondered why I never wrote a review. I will probably see the movie to see if that sparks some love for the book. I think the plot was ok, but there were parts of the novel that seemed to go on and on...and on. I wanted to know more about the albino killer,or just something more interesting.  I guess I simply wanted more. And the problem that I had with the novel is that there was really nothing TOO original...you have religious zealots, secret organizations, secret conspiracy, killers, wealth, beautiful landscapes and a girl who is attracted to a guy, but nothing happens. The only thing that you didn't have, that I can remember that is, is romance. I was even hoping for a little romance to spice up the adventure. Oh, and did I forget to say it was kind of like reading about a treasure or scavenger hunt. Maybe you should not take my advice and read it yourself.
B000E97Y6K|2.0|Oh, how excited I was to hear Peter Jackson was remaking King Kong.  Oh the joy in my heart when I saw that first preview as Kong contronts a T-rex to save his lady love.  Oh, how my heart sank when I heard it was over 3 hours. <br /> <br />This is my main complaint with this film.  It's just too damn long.  Oh, sure, it's often in the name of character development, but I'm not here for character development.  I'm here for giant monkey mayhem!  And dinosaurs! <br /> <br />But in this film, much of the monster action seems almost thrown in as a concession, as if Jackson would much rather get back to people talking or looking dramatically at things instead of dinosaur stampedes and t-rex fights.  Much of the dialoge is painfully heavyhanded, and while the characters are well-defined, they are also re-defined and re-re-defined needlessly. <br /> <br />The action in this Kong failed to hold my attention.  That's beyond comprehension.  Ask anyone who knows me and they'll tell you I can sit and watch giant monsters films all day.  The only sequence that was exceptional in my mind was Kong's fight with three T-rexes.  That was amazing.  The dino stampede: good, not great.  Giant Bugs:  Almost seemed thrown in as an afterthought.  Kong running through the city:  Okay, but pointless.  Kong's final battle:  A foregone conclusion and drained of all suspense. <br /> <br />Of course, some will say I'm just being old school, unwilling to accept this version on principle alone.  They might have a point, but I do know that this Kong was hobbled by a story that was already too familiar and a director who has started to take himself too seriously.  Kong is drained of almost every bit of fun, and wants to impress you with how deep and touching it is. <br /> <br />And if that doesn't spell misfire for a giant monkey movie, I don't know what does. <br />
B0007Y08QA|5.0|A frighteningly emaciated Christian Bale stars as Trevor Reznick, a machinist who has inexplicably been suffering from insomnia for upwards of a year in Brad Anderson's psychological thriller \\"The Machinist\\".<br /><br />Bale's lack of sleep causes him be be distracted, losing focus in the workplace, a critcal condition while working with dangerous machinery.  He begins having hallucinations, seeing imaginary people causing negligence resulting in the loss of an arm by co-worker Miller played by veteran actor Michael Ironside.  He now becomes a pariah at work and soon gets fired.  With his life spiraling out of control he conceivably might gain salvation in the arms of sympathetic prostitute Stevie played Jennifer Jason Leigh, with whom he's had an ongoing relationship.  Unfortunately a series of hallucinations cause him to be verbally abusive to Leigh, torpedoing that life saving possibility.<br /><br />Bale's behavior becomes more and more bizarre and he finds himself running from authorities after filing a false accident report with police.  While fleeing, he has an epiphany realizing the reasons for his severe weight loss and insomnia.<br /><br />Director Anderson finally reveals the mystery of Bale's existence and we realize that what we have viewed is a window into the extreme psychological ramifications of a guilty conscience.  This excellent film does a wonderful job, courtesy of Bale and a finely constructed plot of examining a stressfully twisted mind.
B000AYEIZY|5.0|This is a great album. I also have the DVD, I liked the DVD so much, I wanted the CD to play in the car. I can't believe how good they sound on this album. They were better than I imagined they would be. Eric Clapton's guitar playing is much better here than on all of the original Cream albums. The sound quality of this CD is very good. I think most of the other reviewers pretty much said it all. If you are a Cream fan you will really like this album. One last note, this is a very long album!
B000005HLV|5.0|even if euronymous was a worthless, spineless parasite who got what he deserved he could sure play a mean guitar. the cold distortion and broad sweeping disonent riffs are like a labyrinth. the non stop blasting and bone shaking fills are the drums of murderous ritual. the bass.. yeah well... when audible it adds a very eerie harmoney to it all. and the vocals... NO ONE has since or ever will capture the feeling of black metal like attila has on this album. \\"but he's not screaming like everyone else\\" gimmie a break. the sheer POWER of his voice sends chills down my spine every time i hear it. this was the first black metal album i ever bought and after all these years it still sounds as fresh as it did back then.

0142004413|5.0|I too read this book in my childhood as a compulsory exercise in English class.  Years later when I reread it out loud to my children, and was reduced over and over, frequently on the same page, to helpless, tearful laughter, I wondered how we managed to get through it in school.  The book is an autobiographical rendering of the author's boyhood experience as his family of five travels from dreary, cold England to the sunny, whimsical reality of Corfu.  The pristine island and colourful inhabitants embrace the family and all its idiosyncrasies. Gerry, the little boy, lives a blissful, completely free existence as he explores the flora and fauna of the island with the occasional French lesson thrown in as a silly gesture to seriousness.  The day-to-day experiences of the whole family rush with sparkling hilarity through the pages, leaving the reader gasping for air from laughing too hard.  This is a completely delicious book, the kind of book you want in your library forever.  I have misplaced or lost several copies, and I've just ordered my latest.  I think it is just about my favorite novel of all.
B0002OERI0|4.0|This cd is one of the best. But some songs are not that great. BUT PARENTS IF YOU ARE THING ABOUT GETTING THIS FOR YOU KID THAT IS UNDER 13 DONT!!!! tHIS IS NOT THE MUSIC YOU WANT YOUR KIDS HEARING. THIS IS NOT GOOD FOR KIDS
6305280762|5.0|i just love the disaster movies of the 70's and this is one i really love. sure,most disaster movies are soaps of the highest order but this one is so much fun that you can over look the holes in the plot and the cardboard people that they put in harm's way. mcqueen and newman are both on top of their games and the movie is never dull. the action is the thing here and it has enough action for two movies,so get this one turn off the brain and enjoy a night of action and thrills.

B000EQ4G5K|5.0|This album is incredibly solid, and it deserves alot more attention than her debut.  Songs like \\"Break It Off\\" f/ Sean Paul and \\"SOS\\" have you dancing, while ballads like \\"Final Goodbye\\" and \\"A Million Miles Away\\" have you thinking.  The production on this album is done very well, and I wish Rihanna success. <br /> <br />\\"SOS\\" - 10/10 <br />\\"Kisses Don't Lie\\" - 8/10 <br />\\"Unfaithful - 10/10 <br />\\"We Ride\\" - 10/10 <br />\\"Dem Haters\\" - 7/10 <br />\\"Final Goodbye\\" - 9/10 <br />\\"Break It Off\\" - 8/10 <br />\\"Crazy Little Thing Called Love - 6/10 <br />\\"Selfish Girl\\" - 5/10 <br />\\"P.S (I'm Still Not Over You) - 9/10 <br />\\"A Girl Like Me\\" - 6/10 <br />\\"A Million Miles Away\\" - 9/10 <br />\\"If It's Lovin' That You Want pt. 2\\" - 5/10 <br />
068484267X|5.0|After reading this book,  it is doubtful that anyone could  ever find anything to  complain about again.<br /><br />  In one passage, starving, seeking food, little  \\"Frankie\\" licks a discarded empty fish and chips paper wrapper trying to get some sustenance from its residue of grease.  He retrieved it from the floor of a bar.  It's contents were consumed by a sleeping drunken man.<br /><br />  At other times,  \\"Frankie\\"  is mostly barefoot,  or clunking along streets in makeshift clothes and worn shoes with repaired  soles cut from a discarded bicycle rubber tire.  Doors are slammed in his face by a local parish priest, a school master, contemptous neighbors, cruel relatives, among others.  His mother, Angela through her tears and dismal surroundings consoles him,  offering him the shattered shreds of her strength.  \\"Remember this\\"-  she tells him-  \\"never again allow anyone to close another door in your face.\\"<br /><br />  These and other scorching  memories of his young tender years in Ireland are shared by author Frank McCourt.  Yet even in abject  poverty and suffering, his family never loses their  buoyant hopes for a better life somewhere.  There are Dad's stories, Though her \\"singing voice\\" is gone, there are  Mam's songs.  They bear children. Some die from hunger and sickness; some like Frank and Malachy endure.  They are  much like the tiny  glowing embers among ashes of an almost quenched fire.<br /><br />  The author takes us from America to Ireland and back again to America.  His journey  is a  harrowing, melancholy saga laced with bittersweet memories and humor.  The book never boggs down.  Page after page holds our interest as we are mesmerized by the creativity, and resilient spirit  of this child.  We wonder how in the world  did he manage to survive and become this literate being who holds us spellbound with his words.
0385504209|5.0|Let me start by saying that this book is in no way true, it is a fictional story that is loosly based on theories that have been around and researched for some time but never proven.  As for the ones who say the book isn't accurate to the religeous evidence, it's fiction, it doesn't have to be!!  You don't hear people whine that The Raiders of the Lost Arc isn't accurate with how Hitler and the Third Reich were searching for ancient religeous and powerful artifact during WWII, why?  Because it's a fictional story just like The Da Vinci Code!  Enough of that, most of you know the gist of what the story is about so I won't go into that.  I so want to tell you what the reading experience was for me, this book was a white knuckle, edge of your seat, can't put down, stay up til 3 in the morning reading thrill ride that I hated to see end.  I mean, if you finish a book and when you first put it down you say aloud \\"Now that was a good book!\\" and there isn't anyone in the room to hear it you know you have just read something special!  I absolutly love this book and now that I know there is a prequel (Angels and Demons) I cant wait to get it.  I know the religious content in this book isn't original but the story Dan Brown spins it into is truly genius.  I don't know about the movie, I haven't seen it but I have trouble seeing Tom Hanks playing the part of Langdon, I don't know why but it just doesn't fit to me.  Anyway, if you are one of the few people who haven't read this book it is well worth your time.  I finished it in 4 day which is a first for me.  Hope this helps.
B000005EJL|5.0|Yes, we miss Roger Hodgson, BUT Rick Davies not only sang more than 'Bloody Well Right' during the original lineup (as some people here seem to forget), but Davies has put together a jazzy and sophisticated album.  Perhaps it is more like Steely Dan than Supertramp's more pop oriented tunes under Hodgson, but once again, this disc offers some really classy musical workings....great stuff, and for anyone who ever saw this performed live, like I did when the album was first released, all I can say is WOW! Great concert. So, for those die-hard fans afraid of change, I say, let go of the past and listen with an open mind and ear, and it will impress the heck out of you. Enjoy!
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is almost a necessity for any lover of literature.  It is, perhaps, her most famous piece and has been adapted a number of times.  This latest adaptation does not disappoint.<br /><br />I absolutely love the BBC edition - I've watched it in one whole day a number of times, to the point where I can recite the lines as the actors say them.  I was tentative about this new Pride and Prejudice, worried that it would bring Austen's world crashing down to the ground with bad, flashy acting.  However, the story still holds the same lovely charm of Austen's story, without being too similar to the BBC movie or too far removed.<br /><br />My biggest criticism is that the movie was too short.  For lovers of the BBC movie, this can be a large drawback.  Things happen so quickly (although the movie is 129 minutes long) and there seem to be so many gaps left.  Wickham, for instance, is only seen once or twice, his character completely undeveloped in the movie.  However, this new Pride and Prejudice was meant to cater to the general public and a five hour re-enactment may have weared a number of the viewers.<br /><br />Matthew Macfadyen and Keira Knightly are both different from Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle, yet they still maintain the original charm of the character they are playing.  Knightley's biggest dissimilarity is the fact that she is stick thin, whereas gentry in Austen's time were of a more stout constitution, since a rounder woman meant the family could afford to be well fed.  Her acting, except for a crying scene, is almost flawless.  Macfadyen plays a different Darcy from Firth's haughtier take on the character; Macfadyden is more shy than he is proud.  But he does a good job, and the scene between him and Knightley in the rain is one of the most romantic scenes in any movie.<br /><br />The film, moreover, does not have the glamorize the story, but the house is dirty, hair is messy, things are out of place and imperfect, adding a whole new sense of reality to the movie, something I think the BBC production might have missed.<br /><br />For any lover of Pride and Prejudice, I do no think you will be disappointed in this rendition.  Or, if you are, it will merely be because so much of the story had to be omitted.  For me, I felt between Knightley's Elizabeth and Firth's Darcy, the world of Pride and Prejudice was well rounded and remained true to what Austen had dreamed up.g a whole new sense of reality to the movie, something I think the BBC production might have missed.   <br /> <br />For any lover of Pride and Prejudice, I do no think you will be disappointed in this rendition.

B000007492|5.0|This is a good collection, 15 of Supertramp's best songs and the best single-disc collection of theirs you will find. The sound is great and there are no filler songs, here, they're all great to listen to. Highly recommended.
B00004VXF2|5.0|The feedback patterns of this album are actually quite interesting at times, producing the occasional fleeting melody buried amidst the aural assault of churning feedback noise. But for the most part, this album is exactly that, noise. If you insist that the sound patterns you listen to for enjoyment must be melodic, forget MMM. But if you love having your eardrums blasted out and you love feedback, you will love this album. MMM puts almost all death metal and punk to shame in the sheer volume department. This is also the perfect album to blast out your window if you want to get revenge on your noisy next-door neighbor.
B000AMJDHY|5.0|Probably the best compliment I can give Panic! at the Disco is that these songs are so infectious and bouncy that I can't get them out of my head. Unlike some catchy songs that I DON'T want to have stuck in my head, these ones are welcome. The titles and lyrics are clever, which seems to be a trend lately, but the music is the real standout quality here more than the lyrics. <br /> <br />I think bands like this have the reputation of only being for people in their teens and early twenties, but I'm slightly over 30 and I love this. People who were fans of old-school new wave music can find something to love in this music too. Panic! at the Disco is all-around fun music - the kind of CD you want to have in the car for a long drive on a warm summer day.
B000EULJLU|5.0|I am one of those who were anxiously, desperately waiting for the new Tool album. The fact that Tool's releases are so far in between builds very high expectations among the band's followers, and that is why I understand why so many listeners are disappointed with what 10,000 days offers. However, when I first listened to my copy of 10,000 days, my first thought was that Tool is still a band that stands on its own, and with no other band out there sounding even remotely similar to them.  <br /> <br />Tool still achieves remarkably in what almost every other band today fails: originality.  <br /> <br />Five years passed since Lateralus, and it is only natural that during this time Tool's members have grown, evolved, and more than anything healed through their own, unique brand of art. Every single Tool album is different from one another in both mood, and tone, hence it is very unreasonable to expect Tool to still sound as angry as it did in Undertow, as ranting as it did in Aenima, or as thoughtful and reflective as it did in Lateralus. The one thing that has set Tool apart all this years is their willingness to explore, experiment, and to honestly confront their own emotions in order to successfully express them through their music and lyrics.  <br /> <br />With 10,000 days Tools has moved forward to a new level. Their musical advancement is overwhelming, and musically the band has never sounded better. Mark my words, the mix of sounds Tool has provided with this album will break new ground in the music industry, and many bands out there will try to emulate Tool in years to come.  <br /> <br />Some of Tool's past songs have reached cult status over the years, but \\"Vicarious\\" and \\"Right In Two\\" may very well be their best songs ever. 10,000 days is a fantastic album, and so far it is the best release this year.  <br /> <br />Tool has evolved. Tool has changed. Hopefully this isn't Tool's last stand, because their albums are a gift to music, and they are simply without contest in the music scene.  <br /> <br />After all this years, and 10,000 days later, Tool is still the best band out there, and one of the best musical acts of all time.  <br />
0312323859|4.0|I won't try to convince anyone that this is the best literature ever written, at home between Faulkner and Hemingway on your bookshelf. But it's great escapist reading and it probably won't make you feel like you have to temporarily misplace your brain cells in order to read it.    We first met the main characters in this story in Emily Giffin's first book, Something Borrowed. Something Borrowed was good, but Something Blue is so much better. In the first few chapters, I was wondering why I wanted to read an entire story told from the standpoint of spoiled, selfish Darcy. But I stuck with it and was well rewarded. This story gradually made me care about what happened to Darcy and I wanted her situation to have a happy outcome, which was no small feat because in the beginning of the story I really didn't like her at all.    Emily Giffin's writing seems to be improving with each book, and I'm looking forward to reading her next one. If you are fan of the chick lit genre or are just looking for an entertaining beach read for this summer, check out Something Blue. Just be patient and stick with it if you hate Darcy's character in the beginning!
B00097A5I6|4.0|First of all I'd like to thank the boys for FINALLY getting it right again and bringing us this amazing album! I've been a follower of Oasis for years...and it sure has been a while since they came out with something that is so distinctive and just an overall great listen from start to finish! Thanks!    My track by track breakdown...    #1 \\"Turn Up The Sun\\" 2/10  I'm gonna have to say this is probably my least favourite track of the album and kinda [...] that they decided to start the album off with it.  Kinda bland...doesn't really getcha' goin which usually a starting track does.    #2 \\"Mucky Fingers\\" 7/10  K, when i first heard this one it didn't really do much for me...thought it was alittle too simple and nothing special goin on but after a few listens it began to grow on me...it's one of those that just takes a few to get used to it.    #3 \\"Lyla\\" 9/10  Hmmm...this one sounds familiar;)  Even though they over-played this one to DEATH on the radio it surely is an amazing song!  I love the built-up to the chorus, which alone is one of my FAVOURITE that Liam & Noel have ever done...they're voices bounce-off each other just perfectly!    #4 \\"Love Like A Bomb\\" 10/10  This is my FAVOURITE Liam song to DATE!  Once i heard it, i was addicted and couldn't get it outta my head...i HAD to learn how to play it (which, by the way, isn't all that hard...something like 4 chords).  Nevertheless, it's a brilliant song with a GREAT piano solo and just a great listen overall!    #5 \\"The Importance Of Being Idle\\" 8/10  This is another GREAT creation from Noel who happens to add alittle \\"Being For The Benefit of Mr. Kite\\" with the drum sequence that just so happens to be done by Ringo's son, Zack....coincidence!? Anyways, it's a great track with some impressive vocal work on some of those falcetto notes.    #6 \\"The Meaning Of Soul\\" 7/10  This one is similar to \\"Mucky Fingers\\", where it's simple yet effective & catchy at the same time.  The chorus really gets ya singin' along...i like it...simple but i still like it.    #7 \\"Guess God Thinks I'm Abel\\" 9/10  Another one that i ABSOLUTELY LOVE!  Liam did it again with this one that, to me, sounds like nothing i've ever heard them do before.  Love the strumming and Liam's vocals are bang-on!  Love it!    #8 \\"Part Of The Queue\\" 5/10  This, to me, is an alright track...nothing spectacular.  It doesn't really seem like it belongs on this album...more of a b-side feel to it.  Oh well...we'll take it!    #9 \\"Keep The Dream Alive\\" 8/10  This is, yet again, another GREAT one!  I love the chorus...i don't know...there's something about the vocals on Liam throughout this album...he just hits the right key and the music accompanies it beautifully!    #10 \\"A Bell Will Ring\\" 7/10  To tell you the truth, i REALLY like the beginning of this one but after the rest of the boys kick in i begin to loose interest.  It's a good track but i don't know, i get bored of it after a while.    #11 \\"Let There Be Love\\" 9/10  This is a great 'ender to an amazing album.  Starts out slow 'n easy...with AMAZING vocals when Noel comes in...you have NO idea how many times i skipped-back to hear it....LOVE IT!!!    Overall...i think this is one of they're better albums...right behind Morning Glory & Definetely Maybe.  Good job...lookin' forward to hearing more!!!
B000BKVQTS|3.0|Every so often, a movie comes along that seemingly defies any and all explanations.  Let's face facts; the concept of this whole story is just plain weird.  Here's the pitch: you know those two brothers who wrote all the children's fairy tales?  Well, we want to take these two guys and turn them into con men going around saving villages from \\"ghosts,\\" \\"demons,\\" and the like.  Then, we'll have, oh, let's say the French army, maybe, take them into custody, threaten to kill them, and then send them out to this Germanic village where kids keep disappearing into the forest.  Oh, and we'll throw little scenes of fairy tales in there at random moments - of course, it won't make a whole lot of sense, but we just can't pass up the opportunity to throw Little Red Riding Hood into the mix somewhere.  I'm telling you, man, this baby is going to be huge - that's why we need eighty million dollars to bring this utterly ridiculous story to life.<br /><br />I have to ask: did anyone actually believe this oddity of a film could possibly pay for itself at the box office?  The whole movie was just one ridiculous thing after another.  It's strange, though - the weak plot actually becomes a strength of sorts, as it keeps you on the lookout for whatever twisted fairy tale concept they could possibly throw in the mix next.  I almost hate to admit it (and I certainly don't understand it), but The Brothers Grimm was actually fairly entertaining - largely thanks to Heath Ledger and Matt Damon.  I had no idea this was even Matt Damon until I looked at the credits following the film.  I usually don't care for the guy, so the filmmakers did a great job making him hard to recognize.  The script itself is rather ridiculous; I don't see how anyone inside a film production company could have taken this project seriously.  Someone did, though, and secured a huge budget right along with it.  The money wasn't wasted, as most of the special effects are more than acceptable, but that's just a huge amount of money to spend on a moderately entertaining film destined to have audiences laughing at it as often as they laugh along with it.<br /><br />I must say that they definitely got one thing right in the movie, though.  A mere gust of wind is enough to send a large party of French soldiers into a panic-stricken retreat.  That one satisfying moment isn't enough to make up for all of the time we have to spend with prissy, arrogant Frenchman as the story plods along, but it's by far the most memorable scene for yours truly.  Overall, I would have to give The Brothers Grimm 3.5 stars (which I have to round down to 3).  This could have been a pretty impressive film, but the necessary focus and vision just never came together.  The Brothers Grimm is good for a few laughs, and that's about it.oney to spend on a moderately entertaining film destined to have audiences laughing at it as often as they laugh along with it.

0060512806|5.0|Those of us in the supposedly nerdly professions - you know, professor, computer specialist, etc. - are at risk of living isolated lives devoid of adventure.  I mean, you trained for YEARS for the right to sit in a room with the door closed and THINK for a living, but you sometimes suspect that \\"Out There,\\" outside your little carrel, battles are being fought, treasures lost and re-discovered, and girls won over by the strange alchemy of your combined intellect and derring-do.  Well, dudes and dudettes, Neal Stephenson is the guy for us. <br /> <br />Stephenson tells the WWII-era story of Lawrence Waterhouse, an American of modest origins who has a gift for mathematics and thus cryptography (you know, the making and breaking of codes).  Lawrence is the sort of guy who, when walking about London, is occupied by the notion that a map of the city could be reconstructed by a mere set of hatchmarks indicating the length of his steps as he goes up and down the curbs (i.e.,  _____ - ____    could be Marylebone High Street or some such).   He's the sort of guy whose passion for a girl takes the mental form of a graph (one axis \\"how long since he's xxx'd her\\" and one \\"personal work productivity\\").  Lawrence gets recruited by the war effort to break German codes, and ends up entangled in a scheme that involves a mountain full of German gold that has been shipped to the Pacific.   <br /> <br />In an intertwined story - distinct but eventually related - Waterhouse's grandson Randy, a modern-era computer geek who has inherited his grandfather's cryptanalytical skills, gets involved with a plan to create a virtual electronic currency backed (perhaps) by the sultan of a remote South Pacific island kingdom. <br /> <br />Although Randy doesn't know his grandfather's story, these stories eventually come together in a way that makes Indiana Jones look very pale in comparison.  A partial list of the events, places, and people that crop up along the 900-page way to the book's resolutionwould include:  a nest of spycatchers holed up in a lighthouse in the Orkneys; not one but MANY submarine disasters; more double-agents than I can count; capture, escape, surviving a shipwreck, an air battle, and a shark attack, recapture, enslavement by cannibals, and more escape; hundreds of workers creating an underground mountain hideaway for the loot, elaborate as a pharoah's tomb, only to be buried alive; more escapes, this time involving a complicated mission-impossible-style deception and a detailed knowledge of deep-sea diving; discovery of long-wrecked submarines containing secret documents; earthquakes; and enemies ranging from Goldfinger-class villains to more sympathetic German evil geniuses. <br /> <br />To say that Stephenson makes this entertaining would be to understate the case radically; it's thrilling, intellectually stimulating, and funny as hell.  I've concluded that Stephenson is a real master of his craft, to be able to pull all this together with a result absolutely unrivalled in any other novel of my experience.  <br /> <br />This has got to be one of my top-10 novels of all time, but hey that's just me.  If you crave adventure, humor, and mathematics, perhaps you'll feel that way too. <br />
B0007MWZEK|1.0|It seems that I've had the same experience as others. After owning my little sweeper for a very short time, it started cutting out all of the time. It just wouldn't hold a charge, sometimes for more than a minute! Also, the nifty little brushes around the edges do really get into corners, etc., but don't let it go near any hair! I used it on the tile floor in the bathroom, and thought I'd never get the hair cut off with their little 'seam ripper' which they include with the product. I am very disappointed in this product.
0786856297|5.0|There's always the \\"what to read while waiting for the next HP\\" question for some of us, but...now don't get upset folks - I like Harry Potter as much as you do - \\"Percy Jackson and the Olympians\\" has a modern, hip, even urban style that people weary of Harry's earnest heroism may actually PREFER. <br /> <br />Plus, people with an interest in legends and myths will bug their eyes out with excitement, because the premise of \\"Percy Jackson\\" is that there are a handful of kids who are in fact the children of Greek gods and goddesses, who had come down to dally with modern Americans.  These kids, called \\"half-bloods\\" in the book, grow up not knowing their origins, alienated by their disjointed lives and absent parents.  (A nice conceit of the book is that many half-bloods have dyslexia, but only because their minds are wired for ancient Greek, and ADHD, but only because their minds are wired for hunting, a notion that should give a lot of comfort to real kids with these real problems.) But there are forces of darkness - monsters - whose aim it is to destroy such kids.  They are only protected at a special camp - \\"Camp Half-Blood.\\"  Percy, who turns out to be a son of Poseidon, lands at this camp, but must eventually leave it and risk the monsters, to fulfill a Quest. <br /> <br />Even on the basis of this short description you can see there are a lot of superficial similarities to the Potter books - an orphan, with supernatural powers, who has two friends (one brainy girl and one geeky sidekick), several envious rival students.  He goes to a special school and learns he is highly skilled at the school's favorite sport (in this case chariot racing).  He is personally charged with a quest that, should he fail, will result in the ruin of the world. <br /> <br />Author Rick Riordan almost seems to be teasing the audience with these similarities - but he's having fun with it, and his style and humor are refreshing, humorous, and quite different from Rowling's.  (He gets to the point MUCH faster - the action starts on page 1 and never stops!) My 12-year-old son, to be honest, prefers this, and identifies with it more readily.  It's a clever enough read for adults to enjoy. Highly, highly recommended.
B00003CXDG|5.0|This movie rocks,if you are a John Woo and Tom Cruise fan you will love it, if not you'll hate it. Excellent soundtrack too.
1401301010|2.0|I'm a big RHCP fan, but after reading this book my enthusiasm for their front man has diminished quite a bit.  I always used to hear warmth in his voice, but he comes off as such a clueless jerk in this book that I wonder whether that's warmth at all, or just sonic narcotics.    The book is not that well-written, though expecting a rock star memoir to be great literature is probably unreasonable.  The manuscript could have benefitted from a good editing job.  Too often, for example, the same word will be used over again within the same sentence.  And there are some typos (\\"expect\\" in place of \\"except\\" for example). But more than the writing style, it's the content that is disappointing.    Anthony comes off as utterly unable to learn from his experiences.  After ruining his body with drugs and failing badly in his commitments to his bandmates, he gets clean for a while, only to relapse.  Even after friends die, he goes back to using. Even after he gets kicked out of the band, he goes back to using. He relapses over and over and over (and OVER and OVER) again.  The drug relapses are portrayed so similarly that you will wonder if you are re-reading a previous passage by accident.      Although the end of the book tries to present the case that he is now permanently clean, I don't buy it.  He shows little insight into what emotional demons led him to do drugs in the first place, beyond noticing that he often relapses after breaking up with a woman. He gives lip service to the 12 steps of NA and AA, but doesn't seem to have done any real soul-searching in order to heal the root causes of his addictions.    He's also quite the womanizer.  He repeatedly goes out with vacuous, bitchy, self-entitled model types, and then wonders why it doesn't work out.  His sole criterion for selecting dates seems to be the way they look.  If they are \\"hot\\" and have \\"mad style\\", he then imputes positive character traits to them (such as kindness and intelligence) that often don't really turn out to be there. He stays for years with one looker whose sense of entitlement knows no bounds -- he finances her education, gives her a home and a car, and still, she schemes about ways she can drain more from him. And when he does go out with women who truly appreciate him and seem good for him (such as Jaime Rishar), he whimsically breaks up with them for no apparent reason.    Again, he doesn't seem to learn from his experiences.  He goes through destructive relationship after destructive relationship, but continues choosing the same type of women, and continues behaving the same way himself as he always has.    He has sex knowingly with underage girls, which some folks will find offensive, though I think that it can be contended that a teenager may be mature enough to give consent.  But I was particularly horrified by the account of the Japanese virgin he painstakingly convinces to have sex with him while on tour and then blows off with a shrug when she wants to see him again.    This type of callousness (we'll give him the benefit of the doubt and say it's not intentional cruelty) is in evidence in his relationships with friends, family, and bandmates as well.  He uses people, scams them, and expects to get back in their good graces again and again.  I was especially shaking my head when reading about his relationship with bandmate John Frusciante, whose musical devotion he takes for granted, and whom he sarcastically puts down. Anthony apparently does not realize until Flea tells him years later why John came to dislike him.    Between the never-ending drug habit, the callous way he treats his friends and dates, and his criminal activities as a youth, he comes off as not a very likable guy.  Yes, he had a traumatic childhood that involved divorce, and early exposure to drugs and lawlessness from his father.  But at a certain point in life, a person must take responsibility for his own life, rather than being controlled by his childhood.  Anthony was in hisearly 40's when this book came out and still had not seemed to have made this transition.      As others have written, this memoir is light on details of a musical nature, and heavy on the sex and drugs.  But there are some interesting episodes about the making of various albums, particulary the Peppers' holing up in a haunted house to make Blood Sugar Sex Magic. And there are some funny anecdotes and embarassing revelations about various celebs from Anthony's star-studded life.
B000EWBKM6|4.0|\\"Will and Grace\\" was stylish, moderately daring for network television with very talented performers and guests. The finale was too much poised on a fence, not dramatic enough to be really moving but not funny either. For all the gay humor, only two of the characters were gay out of the entire extended family. One of them was nearly a closet case and still too inhibited to put his arm around his life partner at the end; the other ended up living with his drug abusing female friend, who oddly never aged in spite of alcoholism and worse, a strange message. Like \\"Seinfeld\\" all the characters were selfish to the point of being obnoxious, particularly Grace, but on \\"Seinfeld\\" there was some self-knowledge about that, in fact that was the subject of the finale. For this reason I don't think it will age well. Moments like Minnie Driver dropping the booty she'd stored in various orafices and Debbie Reynolds getting her stole caught in the door will hold up, but the slick and tame way much of the comic drama was handled won't, in fact hasn't already. The cast is very talented and I hope most of them end up on stage in musicals, but I suspect their television careers will never shed these characters' shadows. The next gay network comedy will owe a lot to \\"Will and Grace\\", but here's hoping it's about two men in love instead of a man who'd rather be married to his high school girl friend if she only were properly endowed. PS I'd love to know who was the actor in the body cast. I'm guessing it was Tom Cruise.
B000E97Y6K|3.0|I went to the theatre to see this. It was okay. It wasn't the big blockbuster that everyone was coining it to be. I gave it three stars for the special affects and Adrien Brody. I liked him in the pianist but it makes me wonder why he would waste time in this. I guess he's gotta eat too! Other than that, this was kind of an uneventful movie. It's okay to rent once and throw it back but I wouldn't buy this mess not unless I could get it used for under 5 bucks at amazon.
1577312082|5.0|It may help find enjoyment in the mind-full rants of the highly analytical albeit critical reviews.  To share the experience without judging, as much as possible, let me please say that I feel fortunate that I chose the audio CD. <br /> <br />I initially started listening in the company of a friend with whom it could not be heard without judgement. So, stopping and listening later on my own, I found a wonder-full path.  There are many re\\"mind\\"ers of common and basic, timeless wisdom.  So if you're looking for something \\"new\\" this isn't it.  If you're looking for something you might be missing, you will have to look deeper, and it may be Eckart's voice that helps you to recognize that something (or nothingness) that has no voice that is YOU. It is not an answer. It is and always will be what it is... a stepping stone on your path to enlightenment, should that be where you want to be.
B000AU9UYM|4.0|I liked this. It was well written and the special affects were high-quality. I also enjoyed the acting and the fact that it wasn't extra corny like any of the prior Batman films. I think Bale did a excellent job as Batman along with the supporting cast. The only reason that I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I wasn't too thrilled with the fact that they took an awfully long time building up Bruce Wayne's character. We only get to see him in action as Batman for the last 30 minutes of the film. Another thing that I was puzzled about was the decision to cast Katie Holmes as Bruce Wayne's love interest. It didn't seem like there was too much chemisrty between the two, to me. I think her role was absolutely pointless and it added nothing to the film. Other than those two things I think its a decent film to rent or possibly buy to add to your collection.
1400079179|5.0|With all the hoopla, and religious concerns aside, the Da Vinci Code is a wonderfully well-written book.  The characters are complex, the action continuous, and the plot credible. If the book is lacking anything, its that I wish it had been longer.  I understand there were sections left out when the book was edited.  I'd like to see a second printing which include some of those sections.  You are enticed through the story by a series of clues which demonstrates the truly creative mind of Dan Brown.
B000E97Y6K|4.0|King Kong (2-Disc Widescreen Special Edition) is a special effects dream come true.  In fact one could call it a special effects bonanza. The script is well written, the acting is alright for a monster movie, come on it is not like you expect a Shakespeare performance in this kind of movie so the acting does the job with high grades indeed. I love the music, the editing is top rated. The scene with the dinoaurs is very similair from the original 1930's movie. One scene that I miss that he should have replicated is when Fan Wray screams on the boat but Peter Jackson uses very little of the screaming that Wray did in the orinal movie. It is not nearly as good as the original but being a remake it is not a terrible movie and gets the four stars that it rightly deserves. The scene where kong dies absolutely breaks my heart and yes, I cried because it was very emotional and was in fact better then the original movie.  Verily, I can not wait to see the directors cut to see the extra hour or so that will probably be added to this grand monster movie.
0307277674|4.0|The books moves at a fast pace and is written for cinema. It explores an interesting perspective of the bible and the men who wrote it. Although fiction, it is interesting in that it has the feel of truth, but is not true. It challenges the notion of divine guidance of the authors of the accepted books of the bible.

If you're in the mood for some guitar driven jazz/funk this will suit you just fine. As for calling the tracks on this album \\"throw aways\\" and then comparing them to \\"Kind of Blue\\" (one of the most prolific albums in jazz history) -- that is sheer [...].
B000EMGAOY|5.0|This is a great album.  Im going to keep this short and give my ratings of the songs that I have taken the time to listen to in depth more than some of the previous reviewers(meaning at least 7 or 8 times). <br /> <br />Dani California- 8.5/10 - Catchy Chili Peppers song.  Made for radio and success nevertheless a very enjoyable song with a cool vibe. <br /> <br />Snow(Hey Oh)- 9.5/10- One of the most melodic on the CD. The chorus has a good hook but upon further listening the best part is the sound of Keidis singing/ almost rapping to the pace of the guitar part. <br /> <br />Charlie 6.5/10 - Pretty good song but not a classic.  Probably appeals to the earlier fans more than the newer fans. <br /> <br />Stadium Arcadium 6.5/10 - Good song, straight forward rock song, nothing special. <br /> <br />Hump De Bump- 7/10 - Cool guitar, good feeling.  Funky and fun to listen to but almost annoying <br /> <br />Shes Only 18  8/10 - With a title like that, how can it not be a great song.  Good buildup to energetic chorus, good contrasting.  The highlight is the guitar solo which I think is what makes the song and also ranks among the best solo on the cd if not the best. <br /> <br />Slow Cheetah 9.5/10 - That the Chili Peppers I fell in love with.  Takes a few listens to fully appreciate.  I really like the layering done with the guitars and vocals.  Either you dont like these types of Chili Peppers songs or you love them. <br /> <br />Torture Me - 7.5/10 - Fun song to listen to. Not a whole lot to say <br /> <br />Strip My Mind 8.5/10 - Personally, one of my favorites.  Its message is poignant and I think thats what draws me to it, along with its awesome chorus. <br /> <br />Especially in Michigan 9/10 - Addictive song.  Its got the catchy funk and its got the melody.  It is the chili peppers all wrapped up into one little song.  Feels very emotional and although I have mentioned chorus about 10 times already, it is my favorite chorus of the cd.  <br /> <br />6/10 - Not bad, but a filler track <br /> <br />C'mon Girl 7.5/10- Sounds like a party song, Solid track. <br /> <br />Wet Sand 8/10 - Good song, it seems to be popular but I do have some problems with the overall sound and its feeling of leading somewhere that it never really gets to.  There are parts that just dont work for me in this song but it is still a pretty good song. <br /> <br />Hey 8.5/10 - Im feeling like this one is going to be an underrated song. <br /> <br />For the second CD im just going to point out my favorites, because I am tired. <br /> <br />Desecration Smile 8/10 - By the way style track. <br /> <br />Tell Me Baby 8.5/10 - Very funky, melodic at times and well done.  Lyrics are catchy and rhyming.   <br /> <br />Hard To Concentrate 9/10- a favorite from the cd.  I cant explain it but it has a certain appeal.  It sounds good but also seems to have a genuity to it that I like.  And I love that he is able to use the word palpitate( you can tell that he has been saving that for a long time) <br /> <br />Made You Feel Better 7.5/10- Makes you feel better <br /> <br />We Believe 8/10 - It has the sound that Stadium will be remembered for.  Its chorus reminds me of Aeroplane in some ways. <br /> <br />Hope This Helps Someone
6305511055|5.0|This film has long been one of my Top Ten favorites for the quality of the acting and the screenplay, and for the importance of the theme: that a secret network could operate within the intelligence community beneath the radar of legitimate agency oversight.<br /><br />The film seems especially prescient now, given that the fictional network's goal was planning a U.S. invasion of the Mideast. Voila, 30 years later, the U.S. has invaded the Mideast. When the Redford character finally confronts the rogue C.I.A. leader of the plan, he connects the dots and says, \\"This whole damn thing is about oil, isn't it?\\" Exactly.<br /><br />Let's be clear about why the U.S. Armed Forces are in Iraq, rather than, say, Ecuador or Nepal: it's the strategic importance of the region's oil. Yes, the plan is to transform Iraq into a democratic nation, which will lead the entire region in that direction. But the U.S. isn't committing its treasure and citizenry to all troubled regions of the globe equally; we are in Iraq because it is the strategic linchpin of the region. Without access to the Mideast oil reserves, the world economy would be shaken to its foundations.<br /><br />There are many troubled, undemocratic regions in the world--for example, much of Africa; yet we fight now to establish democracy in only one troubled region, the Mideast. Coincidence? No. Simple self-interest. As the Cliff Robertson character says at the film's conclusion: \\"When the people are cold and their engines stop running, they're not going to ask us why; they'll just want us to go get it.\\"<br /><br />Realizing that he is an embarrassment to the C.I.A. (the inevitable role of any whistleblower, even a reluctant one), at the film's end Redford gives the entire story to the New York Times. The Robertson character, a C.I.A. station chief who was caught off-guard by the hidden conspiracy, says, \\"But will they print it?\\" Redford is taken aback at the implication--that the government could pressure the media to suppress the story--and then he avers, less confidently, \\"They'll print it.\\"<br /><br />This is the core of democracy: that a free press keeps a government answerable to its people. Without a free and skeptical press, all the elections in the world mean nothing.media to suppress the story--and then he avers, less confidently, \\"They'll print it.\\"  <br /> <br />This is the core of democracy: that a free press keeps a government answerable to its people.

B00004YZT5|5.0|When you hear the first three albums of Poison with CC in it, you dont know when a song stops and when the next one starts. It all sounds the same. There are some cool party anthems but it gets pretty boring and highly predictable. Native Tongue is absolutely amazing. Ritchie Kotzen fires up the album with terrific Blues Influenced playing and his solos show his mastery of styles of Rock, Blues, Funk and NeoClassical. His playing is also so fluid and effortless than you begin thinking it's so easy to play unless you have a clue to how to play guitar. This one is a Master Piece. <br />Get it. Even if you have the Slightest Idea of the kind of player Ritchie Kotzen is, you will know that CC is nothing other than a bunch of happy tunes...
0800141660|5.0|If you are as big a fan of period films as I am, this is a must-have for your DVD collection.  Set against the backdrop of the lovely English countryside, this story has all the elements that make for fine costume drama: love, romance, betrayal, unrequited affection, and a bit of comedy.  Emma Thompson, who plays Elinor Dashwood, is the heroine of the film.  Kate Winslet plays her younger sister, Marianne Dashwood.  The youngest of the Dashwood sisters, 12-year old, Margaret, played by Emily Franciose, is both adorable and colorful. She brings comedy and a refreshing innocence to the film as does other eccentric characters like Mrs. Jennings and Sir John.<br /><br />The story begins with the death of their father, who, due to the legalities of the time, was not able to bequeath his estate to his daughters.  Consequently, the Dashwood girls and their mother are left penniless and must depend on the generosity of the legal heir to the fortune, John Dashwood, son from the father's previous marriage. The father makes John promise to provide for his step-mother and sisters, and John agrees. John's wife, Fanny, is introduced in the following scene, and the audience immediately discovers Fanny's comfortable ability to manipulate her husband and control every situation to her advantage.  She is self-serving, greedy and conniving throughout the film, and she has John wrapped completely around her finger.  She weaves a web of contrived, non-sensical explanations as to why John can not and should not keep his promise to his father to provide for his sisters and stepmother; John acquiesces; hence, the Dashwood girls are left with no means of support and no dowries. Alas, herein lies their dilemma as suitors will be reluctant to offer proposals of marriage to women in such dire straits. This fact becomes painfully evident when Marrianne falls deeply for the gallantly handsome, Willoughby, who by all accounts is a cad of the first order, albeit unbeknownst to Marianne. Set to inherit his aunt's vast estate, Willoughby is disinherited once his benefactress discovers his wanton ways. He must then choose whether to \\"rank the demands of his heart above that of his pocketbook\\".  He's, therefore, confronted with the decision to marry the impoverished Marianne or propose to the wealthy heiress, Miss Grey.  He opts for the latter but not before breaking Marianne's heart and leaving her with no explanation for his abrupt break with her.<br /><br />Marianne for much of the film pines away over Willoughby, (she really is quite pathetic), while the level-headed and longsuffering Elinor spends her time comforting her and pointing out to Marianne Willoughby's improprieties and the non-reality of one's happiness being totally dependent on one person. Elinor is ever so noble; she provides constant emotional support to Marianne and works assiduously to make ends meet for the family while accepting the possibility that her hope of uniting with the man she loves,the honorable Edward Ferrars, played by Hugh Grant, may never be realized.<br /><br />It is intriguing to watch how the contrasts between Elinor and Marianne interweave to form a delicate tapestry that brings balance to their existence or co-existence, as it were.  Marianne spends 90% of the movie prating about love, Shakespearean sonnets, and flowery affection, while the more reserved Elinor looks at life through the lens of practicality, always espousing the virtues of honor and duty.  Nevertheless, they are both very likable characters, and the viewer roots for them in their quests for love.  The costumes are completely authentic and the cinematography breathtaking.  It was beautifully and artfully shot, so if you like visually stunning period pictures with realistic plot lines and stellar performers, you won't find a better one than Sense and Sensibility.
0060516070|5.0|The book focuses on exactly what it is to be effective as a quality decision maker.  The audience could be a CEO or any other enabled knowledge worker. <br /> <br />I found Drucker's view encouraging because he feels these aptitudes are not inherent in anyone without the effort of learning these skills.  On the other hand, the book is not necessarily a roadmap to the CEO's office as one might hope.  In-fact, it merely addresses what an individual's goals should be and the behavior necessary to be effective.   <br /> <br />The book is also curiously out of date.  This is no shortcoming.  The issues which were current at the time lend an excellent perspective.  The principles presented are not only still true; we understand how history has treated the examples given in the last 40 years.  The book has aged very well.  In some ways it is has more value than it had originally. <br /> <br />There is no magic formula in this book.  This is not a cheap 12 step program to the big chair.  The book simply illustrates valuable principles that are necessary to be as effective as a decision maker.
B000ETQRCM|4.0|There is a reason Pearl Jam's latest album moved more units in its first week of release than 2002's \\"Riot Act\\" or 2000's \\"Binaural\\"--the tranquilizers have been dispensed with! Pearl Jam are rocking finally, or at least mostly throughout their new cd. There are 'hits' too like the first single \\"World Wide Suicide\\" or \\"Marker In The Sand\\" or \\"Gone\\". Eddie Vedder sounds like he's got something important to say again--just look through the lyrics. They cover introspection, love, relationships, religion and politics.<br /><br />Not since 1998's \\"Yield\\" have Pearl Jam sounded as vital as they do here. The whole cd holds together very well with almost no wasted space. The only song I think I could have doen without is \\"Army Reserve\\". Otherwise, the first five songs are all rockers, plus \\"Big Wave\\". \\"Parachutes\\", \\"Unemployable\\", \\"Come Back\\" and \\"Inside Job\\" are more mellow tracks, but everyone is in fine form this time out. If you are a Pearl Jam fan, you will want to add this to your collection. If you are new to Pearl Jam, this isn't a bad place to start.<br /><br />Now, let's see if the band can capitalize on this momentum for their next album.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|If you see a 4 star or less review for this album... Stop right there, don't read it or your mind will be filled with false information from the likes of people who can't understand the complexity of songs such as Parachutes or Army Reserve, & can't cope with their style as it is outside their radio-friendly \\"U2\\"-type BS <br /> <br />This is the best album of the year & the best hard rock album of the decade. It is an instant classic.
1400034205|5.0|Other reviewers have compared Somerset Maugham to Henry James, and I had to agree as I recently re-read his classic THE RAZOR'S EDGE.  The story is compelling, and has once again, after finishing, haunted me for several weeks.  However, this time I was even more impressed with the beautiful language and structure of the story.  Also, while there are many themes throughout, it was the passion of Larry Darrell's superficially passionless approach to life that stood foremost.  \\"Passion doesn't count the cost.  The heart has its reasons that reason takes no account of.\\"  Despite the pragmatic restrictions, most of us want to live one's life as Larry chooses to do, and after absorbing Maugham's work, one inevitably will chart a new course.<br /><br />An excellent read while traveling abroad...
B000EWBKM6|3.0|First of all the \\"SPOILERS\\" need to knock it off!<br />You are here to review, not spoil the show for others.<br /><br />The final episode should be titled, \\"Jack and Karen\\". They made the finale for me. Jack's loyalty to Karen was shocking yet touching. I don't think I could have done it.  LOL<br /><br />The ending may make it difficult to watch previous episodes.  Grace's decision left me feeling betrayed and disturbed.<br />I can't believe that her character turned out to be so pathetic.
0553801503|4.0|While I understand many's concerns as to the stagnant nature of Martin's half complete Feast of Crows, I feel that it is still a worthwhile read and an excellent piece of storytelling. Martin has given us the complete story of half the characters instead of half the story of all the characters, and rightly so it leaves a hole and a yearning for more!, especially after we waited so long in the first place.     However, I still love his writing. I still think he makes writing seem effortless and the intricacies of his plots amaze me. This is indeed a transition piece where some loose ends are tied off, characters are still growing as people, and not much happens but a lot of traveling. More so in this book though, I loved reading each segement equally, as he seemed to even out what happened in each section, so that I wasn't holding myself back from skimming ahead to a character I would rather read.     My main qualm is that it still seems like there was content edited out even though the book was split. Often times something would be announced after the fact, and I would flip back in the book to see where it happened. It hadn't been mentioned, but later in the book a character would mention it to another, and I would find that there had been no description of this event, almost as though the chapter had been cut short and a hasty sidenote had been made at a later date. It just seemed unlike Martin's usual style.     I do love the fact that Martin is developing the characters and using this as a transition piece. My favorite aspect of the Fire and Ice series is that I am actually in such a complex world of characters. Most authors would shy away from adding so many levels to their novels, it just gets too hard to juggle. But what makes it so entertaining for me is the grand scheme of it all. I know that when the series is finished I'm going to look back and go what a wild ride, and I felt like I was growing with each and every character.     My other little peeve is how graphic the novel is- I've heard other's complain but it never really phased me. In this novel, it seemed that the sex and gore seemed to make up for the fact that other parts of the novel were a little bit slower, almost as though he was trying to spice it up a bit. Gore and sex as they are don't bother me and it never had in his past books. In this one however, it appeared almost like fan service. I could be wrong, maybe not. I took away a star more for the holes I had mentioned earlier.     Overall, I still love Martin and I loved this book.
B000002UAO|5.0|George Harrison called Rubber Soul and Revolver \\"Volume 1 and Volume 2,\\" an apt description.  Rubber Soul is the foundation on which Revolver and Sgt. Pepper's -- and really every subsequent album -- were built.  In the way that Revolver and Sgt. Pepper's would later be the seminal works for \\"psychedelic\\" rock, Rubber Soul was significant in influencing the mid-60's explosion of so-called folk-rock or \\"electric folk.\\"  Rubber Soul opened the door to mainstream audiences for bands like The Byrds, The Mamas & the Papas, Simon & Garfunkel, and later the likes of Crosby, Stills & Nash.<br /><br />Without a doubt, Rubber Soul was not the lone cause of the mainstreaming of folk rock.  Bob Dylan was more influential in that arena than the Beatles.  Had the Beatles not, themselves, fallen in love with Dylan's music, there'd be no Rubber Soul.  Likewise, hints of what were to come on Rubber Soul were evident on Help! (e.g. \\"I've Just Seen a Face\\" and \\"Hide Your Love Away\\".)  But, the Beatles cast such a large shadow over the music world, even in 1965, that just about anything they did stylistically had mass appeal and influenced artists of the day.<br /><br />The Beatles took the hints of folk and soul from Help! and built Rubber Soul around them, made a whole rock n' roll meal out of those morsels.  To carry the analogy further, many of the up-and-comers in the music business of the time took this meal and built restaurant chains with similar menus.<br /><br />Besides its understated impact, Rubber Soul is a great collection  of songs.  \\"Norwegian Wood,\\" \\"You Won't See Me,\\" \\"Girl,\\" \\"In My Life,\\" and, \\"I'm Looking Through You,\\" are nothing shy of fantastic.  \\"Drive My Car,\\" though somewhat light-hearted lyrically, is years ahead of its time musically, a precursor to the sonic funk of the 70's.  The rest of the songs are great.<br /><br />The cover art, like Sgt. Pepper's, Abbey Road and Revolver, is classic.  The elongated faces of the Fab Four, like Elvis in his gold lame suit, are iconic.<br /><br />If you're a Beatles fan, you'll already have this album.  If you're discovering them for the first time, Rubber Soul's a nice album to acquaint you with their genius.gold lame suit, are iconic.   <br /> <br />If you're a Beatles fan, you'll already have this album.

1400079179|1.0|This books is one of the worst-written things I have ever read. The characters are cardboard, the prose is turgid, and he writes dialogue like George Lucas. He also has this bad habit of ending every chapter with a fake \\"cliffhanger.\\" By the end of the book I was hoping something dire would happen to the main characters so the dratted thing would end already. Unfortunately, they live.<br /><br />I could have lived with the author's gross mischaracterization of church history and the nature of Christianity if he could have written his way out of a paper bag.<br /><br />The only reason I made myself finish this piece of tripe was to discuss it with people who were talking about it and have an informed opinion. Also, I had lots of free time.<br /><br />I advise you not to waste yours.
B000EDWKXI|5.0|I loved this movie.  I think the previews for this movie wernt made well, because they didnt make me want to see it but I watched it anyway and loved it!! Time very well spent. I'm actually watching it right now for the second time in two days.
B000EULJLU|4.0|I Rate this album as on-par with Lateralus now, it starts off evil, the first two songs get almost death metal towards there endings. But i also like the sort of pink floyd influenced epics like Wing for Marie part 1 + 2, they are actually really well composed pieces of work. Rosetta stonned gets really powerful as well, you just have to get used to it. Intension is also really good with Right in Two. Has anyone here mentioned the fact that you can combine the songs Wings for Marie and 10000 Days (Wings Part 2) together with Viginti Tres to make one awesome song, if you can some how get a program to do so. It is intentional on the bands part so dont worry if you begin to think its just some sort of mirical or something.. like i know you tool freaks would do.  <br /> <br />Enjoy this album for what it is, and you'll realise how good it is. A blunt wouldnt hurt either.
B000E6UK5K|4.0|THIS IS MOST LIKE EARLY/MID PINK FLOYD, ESPECAILLY MEDDLE. <br /> <br />This is David Gilmour's third studio solo album. It comes in a very nice booklet style case, like a mini hardcover book.  It is 53 minutes long and the sound quality is excellent. <br /> <br />Some people rave about the sonic quality.  Sure that makes this CD even more enjoyable.  But, sonic quality is not the only reason to buy a CD.  In the eighties, there many New Age CD's that sounded beautify, but were boring and had no meat.  And great sound is given with any product from the members of Pink Floyd, who have always been on the leading edge. <br /> <br />I really enjoy the songs on this CD.  I think it is one of the better things that any member of the band has done since The Wall.  It is not quite as good as Roger Water's Amused to Death. <br /> <br />This CD sounds most like Pink Floyd's \\"middle period\\" from More to Obscured By Clouds.  Much of it sounds like the first side of Meddle.  This was the time before Roger Waters really started to dominate the song writing, and band played more traditional and more mellow songs.  They still have that atmospheric Pink Floyd sound, but none of the aggressiveness that Waters added to the music. <br /> <br />My favorite David Gilmour album is About Face. He did had a fantastic concert tour to support this album.   Fans looking for something like Comfortably Numb should get About Face instead of On An Island.  Gilmour's first studio album is more traditional rock/blues, but still very good.
068485743X|4.0|After reading lumbering piles of weak and careless manuscripts, Noah Lukeman decided to take a stand. Apparently, writers all over the globe repeatedly make the same mistakes. And many are obvious ones. Reading this book gives the impression that he has labored over hundreds, perhaps thousands, of painful submissions. Some of the errors he points out seem impossible. For instance, who would actually submit something like this to an agent: \\"The boy ran. Into the woods. It was dark. Scary. The light pulsed through the leaves. It started to rain. Cold. He fell. He got up.\\" But right under this example, in the \\"Style\\" chapter, he says \\"Don't laugh, I've seen examples much worse than this - where it kept up for three hundred pages\\".<br /><br />To ease the pain, he claims, agents find ways to dismiss a manuscript as soon as possible. The first five pages become a standard to judge the entire work.  But before that, many look at the state of the submission itself. Does it exude professionalism or does it look like it just woke up? The latter? Out it goes. Now begin reading. Whoops, the first sentence contains ten adverbs. A sure sign of sloppy writing. Bye bye. And this sentence doesn't \\"sound\\" right. Neither does this one. Ciao! In three main sections, Lukeman lists the main mistakes that will land a submission in the slush. Some take seconds to locate. Others take more than a furtive glance. They progress in order from quick and easy dismissals (grammar, mechanics, and dialogue) to issues that require more scrutiny (viewpoint, tone, character). Ninety-nine percent of all submissions don't make it to the final stages of examination. Many get weeded out with a glance. Lukeman warns the prospective writer: don't let it happen to you.<br /><br />Helpful as all of this is, the book only provides a cursory view of writing and publishing. Experienced writers probably won't gain much. Some of its advice seems well worn and obvious. And the technical details don't really pass the basic level. Not only that, the over the top bad examples cited seem a little forced at times. They invoke both incredulity and laughter. If Lukeman has actually received submissions on this level, then it becomes perfectly clear why he wrote the book: he doesn't want to see any more of this garbage. Still, experienced writers are way past many of these slipshod foibles.<br /><br />Beginning writers are another story. They should probably commit this book to memory. In fact, it could serve as a great introduction for someone pondering writing as a career. Many high-level questions get answered in its very readable 200 pages. Not only that, beginners need to know about inexcusable mistakes early on. Section One lists some doozies. Put them in your head.<br /><br />\\"The First Five Pages\\" delivers a good high-level read on the publishing industry as well as some high-level writing advice. But more detailed books will have to fill in the gaps. After all, nine pages on style and fifteen on characterization doesn't really cut it as an \\"exhaustive treatment\\". But regardless of its brevity, this book will likely provide beginning writers with enough inspiration to get moving on those ideas collecting dust in their brains.basic level.

B000EWBKM6|5.0|The fabric of television has changed significantly since Will & Grace made its debut, and it's easy to forget that this little sitcom paved the way for what now seems commonplace to us - openly gay men on TV. I love that the finale gave me, the viewer a satisfying ending with both Will and Grace winding up ultimately happy and eventually reconciled in their friendship. I loved the poignancy and corniness of Karen and Jack's musical number and all in all I was left feeling extremely satisfied. Well done!!!!
0451450523|5.0|One of my longterm guilty non-reads has been Peter Beagle's The Last Unicorn. And my gosh, I'm glad I finally did. It's a remarkable, beautiful, book. The prose is lovely, the story very moving, the characters involving -- the plot, well, probably just OK but that's not at all the point.  <br /> <br />The story is about, no surprise, the last unicorn in the world. As the story opens she is brought to a vague realization that there are no other unicorns anymore, as far as anyone knows. She ends up deciding to search for her fellows, and soon gathers that they were taken away by the agency of the nasty King Haggard, and his mysterious creature the Red Bull. She is captured by a witch running a traveling animal exhibit, but she escapes with the help of a rather incompetent magician named Schmendrick. Schmendrick is tormented by his inability to control his magic in any way, and usually his inability to do any real magic. The two begin to follow Haggard's trail, but Shmendrick is captured by the outlaw Captain Cully, who imagines himself Robin Hood but doesn't quite manage it. Shmendrick escapes, of course, accompanied now also by Molly Grue, a rather faded and beaten down version of Maid Marian who had been cooking for Cully's band for years. And the three make their way to Haggard's strange castle, and to the neighboring town, cursed by prosperity.  <br /> <br />At the castle the unicorn encounters the Red Bull, and is unable to deal with it -- and Shmendrick saves her, but by the terrible means of making her a human woman. Admitted to Haggard's haggard castle, they meet his amiable son, and of course the son falls for the unicorn in her womanly form. And eventually she begins to fall for him, once he understands that what she wants is not heroic quests and the heads of dragons and ogres. The shape of the story is clear, and the only resolution -- for Haggard to be deposed and the unicorns freed the Red Bull must be vanquished, and that vanquishing will require a certain sacrifice.  <br /> <br />As I said, it's quite wonderful. In particular the first few chapters are astonishingly beautiful: some of the most intense prose I've ever read -- yet always undercut by odd humor and something akin to cynicism but not quite that. These abrupt shifts in tone work startlingly well. Beagle can't really maintain that level, though he reaches such heights again when needed, particularly at the climax. It's truly a treasure.  <br />
1400079179|4.0|I'm a devout Christian of the Baptist faith, and blessedly have studied the bible for over twelve years; therefore, I can clearly absorb this book without any antsy feelings or anger.  It's fiction, a good read for a weekend of nights-at-home.<br /><br />I tip my hat to Dan Brown for creating a well told story from historical and theological ideas existing in the real world:  the Priory of Scion, Da Vinci's curiously ingenious creations, the many churches along with their storied histories, the violent past of Christianity, and Opus Dei to name a few.<br /><br />Please relax and enjoy it.  Ignore the controversy.  It reads quite well.<br /><br />By the way, please realize that the follow-up streamlined movie cuts out a lot from the book but still plays well on the screen if no overzealous nitpicking materializes.
0515123447|5.0|I picked up \\"Killing Floor\\" in hardback on the clearance rack at Half Price Books for $1.00 about 7 years ago (good luck finding it now!)  I knew nothing of the author and really just needed something to pass the time between Dark Tower installments.  Little did I know... <br /> <br />I literally couldn't put this book down from the time I opened it until it was complete.  \\"Killing Floor\\" has an original plot, contains an interesting \\"hero\\", and kept me guessing to the finish. <br /> <br />Since \\"Killing Floor\\" I have bought and reads ALL of Lee Child's books, all in hard back and all as soon as they were available, and have never felt cheated. <br /> <br />I was concerned that the books would get boring after several installments (as with James Patterson's books, when you have the same indestructible character over and over, sooner or later you get tired of reading about them).  Fortunately, each \\"Jack Reacher\\" novel has had a completely original premise, and I haven't gotten bored yet.   <br /> <br />I recommend this book wholeheartedly. <br />
B000059XUO|5.0|I've seen \\"The Crow\\" so many times (anyone who was around 13 when this movie came out should understand) that one would think it only natural for a person of that generation to have come to a conclusion about the moral of the story, a final judgment of the film.  This would be presumptuous.<br /><br />Eric Draven, a young man very much in love with his wife, Shelley Webyster, is dealt a cruel hand in every sense of that term; he is forced to watch while a group of (believably) degenerate thugs rape her as he dies from a quick knife wound.<br /><br />Resurrected from the dead by forces we never get to understand fully, Draven dishes out grisly punishment just as bad as he got.  Painting his face up with his wife's wedding makeup (the symbolism here is beautiful, and all of it is owed to James O' Barr's masterpiece graphic novel of the same name), he possesses powers of recuperation and invulnerability to pain that can only be characterized as divine.<br /><br />The cinematography here is perfect; when Draven is leaping across the rooftops, just understanding precisely what he is and how he came back from the dead, Nine Inch Nails gives their try at \\"Dead Souls\\" by Joy Division.  It works.  Perhaps the most representative seen of the whole film is where he confronts Tin Tin before killing him, the urge toward vengeance pumping through his veins like a steroid from high above.<br /><br />Draven inhabits a remorseless dark night of a world in which ghosts are certainly not believed in.  (Too bad for the boss and everyone else.)  Rain falls constantly, and the director did a perfect job of starting a new Goth trend that was alternately corny and stylish.  In the end, we cannot fault Draven for his actions; and the people he eliminates are one step above animals.  This is a Shakespearean tale of absolute wrath.<br /><br />I often wondered if this would have been so popular if the unfortunate Brandon Lee had not been killed during filming accidentally.  I still think it would have.  I remember every line from this film almost verbatim, just from repeated viewings with friends.  This is a haunting, important film and more than a must see.l think it would have.  I remember every line from this film almost verbatim, just from repeated viewings with friends.

Progressive political activists will recognize the dilemas Spider Man faces while struggling for justice.   <br />The film's indictment of our military industrial complex is needed now more than ever.  We have a lot of Green Goblins at the Pentagon and Lockheed Martin. <br />Dafoe is excellent.

And Without you I'm Nothing blew me away after that. But when Black Maket music came out, I could sense things were changing. And while sleeping with Ghosts had it's moments,some very good, I found myself trying to convince myself to like it more than I actually did. I liked the more organic feel of the first two albums. For me, it's over for this band. So sad to say.

B000EWBKM6|5.0|This episode just finished a few minutes ago, and as an avid Will and Grace fan who has every episode literally memorized, I must say this was not as I predicted at the beginning of the season.  I thought Will and Grace would end up together in the end, and I was almost right until this episode. *****Spoilers!!!!**** <br /> Will and Grace end up not talking for two year, each having a child in the mean time.  By the meddling of Jack and Karen, they end up meeting again.  Karen ends up broke after the divorce and doesn't want Jack to be with Beverly Leslie to have the money each loves.  Twenty years pass and Will and Grace haven't seen each other until their children meet at college in the same manner they did.  Jack and Karen live together with the aging Rosario.  Their children end up getting married and each of the group find that they haven't changed.  Over all I am pleased with the ending and can't wait to get this DVD.
B000EMGAGW|2.0|I'm just like many Mobb Deep fans when I saw them on the cover of the XXL magazine along with 50 Cent and the \\"New G-Unit\\", and dropped my jaws in disparity. I myself been a huge fan of Havoc and Progigy since P dropped his solo album \\"H.N.I.C.\\" back in 2000 and going foward and backward in their discorography (The Infamous...classic) estabolishing the duo in my top 10 favorite rappers.<br /><br />It's not that I actually care if they're in G-Unit. It's that I feared that this wouldn't be like the first 4 albums, and the duo may show lasiness in this album. As I would have guessed, this album would have been flooded with appearances from various G-Unit members. It wasn't as bad as I thought it would be, because the only person who constantly inhabits the album is 50 Cent, on a hook, a verse, or just saying a couple of lines. Their first single \\"Put Em In Their Place\\" has very little lyrical content and a very weak hook for it to be a normal single. The song \\"Creep\\" would have a sort of tempting beat, that reminds you of their previous album \\"Amerikas Nightmare\\", but may come off skippable. Songs like \\"Backstage Pass\\" and \\"Capital P, Capital H\\" is a perfect example of horrible and uncreative Mobb Deep rhymes. It seems like they have gotten real lazy because as most of the album tells, the only motive for Hav and P is to get money and women (and I seriously thought that Havoc was going to come off real hard on this album).<br /><br />There are some moments that may barely touch the late 90's early 2000's of Mobb Deep. The opening track \\"Smoke It\\" as it has a nice beat, but its flooded by the \\"pick up the new album\\" lyrics of the duo. Why are they telling us to pick up the album if we already have it questions me. The Alchemest produced \\"The Infamous\\" the beat that reminds me of Common's \\"Getting Down At The Ampetheatre\\" beat would be the best track on the CD. Another standout track would be \\"Pearly Gates\\" which features 50 Cent. Somehow all verses on point, and as you can tell religion is not a big thing in  Prodigy's life as he says \\"Tell the boss man we got beef...when I see his son...I'ma [beat him] like a movie...we don't give a f*** about this [religious bullsh**]...\\" as the Corporate officers of Interscope took offense and censored the words that were in the brackets. If you want to hear Prodigy's verse without the edits, you can download the song somewhere or you can un-reverse the words yourself.<br /><br />\\"Have A Party\\" and \\"Outta Control Part 2\\" are the bonus tracks that were featured on the \\"Get Rich Or Die Trying Sountrack\\" and 50 Cent's \\"The Massacre\\" CD/DVD rerelease. Nothing special if you just want more of Mobb Deep or 50.<br /><br />As many have guessed, Blood Money had to have been a step backwards for the group. Teaming up with 50 Cent has pushed Mobb Deep in a whole another different direction, and judging from the good relationship, I don't think thats going to change anytime soon. Thinking to sell more records and get more money by teaming up with the currently rap's most disliked group has put Mobb Deep on the otherside of the lines. If they're 7 albums deep, then money shouldn't be a big motive to them. Now it feels like they've just gotten lazy as time went along and attempting to sell out. Heck, not one person spits two verses except Prodigy in \\"The Infamous\\". I wouldn't have minded a solo from one Havoc, since I really thought he was showing improvement. I hate to say this; but unfortunately if this doesn't change, we are seeing the fall of Havoc and Prodigy, once known as one of hip hop's best groups.<br /><br />Beats: B-<br />Lyrics: C<br />Guest Appearances: D+<br />Overall: C-<br /><br />Standout Tracks: Pearly Gates, The Infamouson is not a big thing in  Prodigy's life as he says \\"Tell the boss man we got beef...when I see his son...I'ma [beat him] like a movie...we don't give a f*** about this [religious bullsh**]...\\" as the Corporate officers of Interscope took offense and censored the words that were in the brackets.

1577314808|5.0|A co-worker gave me this book, and I could not be more grateful.  <br /> <br />This book will not be for everyone. If you are familiar with the psychological stages of faith, the final stage is often called transcendence. If you have struggled with what that stage means, this is the book for you. <br /> <br />Every paragraph either presents a new insight or gives a practical new perspective on a previous insight. <br /> <br />For me, this book explains at a very deep level the simple path to transcendence of self . . . the spiritual message that is at the core of Christianity, Judaism, Buddhism, Taoism, and probably most other religions. Briefly put, one has to surrender ego; ego identification with one's own thinking, with the past and future, with physical frailties, with other people, etc. By stripping away these ego identifications, one is left with the natural state of \\"being\\", which is a state of joy and peace. Becoming fully present and in a state of \\"being\\", one then creates profound changes in all relationships of which s/he is a part. Simple, but not easy. However, the difficulty is not in the \\"doing\\", but in the letting go. This is a brief, but totally inadequate summary of this excellent book.  <br /> <br />I underlined it to death and just about exhausted my supply of asterisks reading it. I am a fairly prolific reader of psychology/spirituality literature, and I would rate this one of the top 3-4 books I have ever read. The others helped get me to the point of being able to appreciate this book.

B000EPR7NE|5.0|Just saw the movie and I loved it as I love the soundtrack. This movie is going to be a huge hit, and probably surpass Titanic in Box office at how much media attention its getting. Anyway, you barely hear the score throughout the movie, you're just focused on the plot and the chracters.  <br /> <br />However, in the very last sequence, when he discovers the Grail's location, the music is Five Stars.  <br /> <br />Wow, words can not describe the climax. The cinematography, Tom Hanks and the music make the ending the most memorable ending I've ever scene. It's amazing. I think the track called during this scene is called \\"Chevaliers de Sangreal\\" It just builds and builds until the final moments.  <br /> <br />I would pay five dollars(or eight for th evening showing) again to see that part, just that part. The sound is just breath taking. It sounds so Royal and climatic, and Hanks along with the music finishes the movie off with such splendor and grace. It give you a true sense of self-worth and rightousness(sp?).  <br /> <br />5 stars or A+++ whatever you prefer for the movie and the soundtrack. Well done.
0307277674|5.0|Let me say one thing, this book is a fine piece of writing. I come across few books that are this engaging. I will also say this: know thyself. This book will bring up interesting ideas for anyone with religious foundations. This book is first and foremost a suspense novel. I admit that I only read this beacuse of all the debate and my curiousity to see what the big deal is. This fascinating book really doesn't bring up that much new ideas in the academic world...these ideas have already been discussed. *sigh* So, I find that all this discussion really comes from biased ignorance. Carefully examine the characters, should you read this, and you will understand.<br /><br />Finally, this is the verdict: a great book for the suspense loving reader, but a possible religious obstacle for a soul. (A helpful tip when reading: remember it is FICTION)

B000EMGAOY|5.0|The one word that comes to mind when listening to the new Red Hot Chili Peppers CD is \\"wow\\". This could be one of the better CDs to hit the shelves the last decade or so. Despite aging, the band still finds a way to innovate their sound while at the same time staying true to their early roots of funk rock. <br /> <br />The 2 disc album shows a lot of range by the band. A little piece of each of their past CDs is evident through out the cd. Yet it somehow still finds a way to flow very smoothly despite this conglomerate of sounds. From funky lyrics similar to Blood Sugar Sex Magik, to softer melodies found on By the Way, the band uses it all. Finding a medium to incorporate all these sounds into one brilliant album is truly an art form that the band has mastered. <br /> <br />Each band member performs at their pinnacle in this tour de force of an album. From the lyrics to the instrumentals, Stadium Arcadium shows why the Red Hot Chili Peppers are still one of the elite bands of our generation. It is a definite must for any collection, whether you are a fan of the band or not.
0393327345|4.0|Chuck Palahniuk has written a modern tale for modern times. In a society where success is measured by bank accounts and buicks, we see an original voice pop on the scene saying we can have more than that.<br /><br />\\"Fight Club\\" is a short read with a far reaching message. While some view this book as another in a long line of repetitive jargon about opposing the modern world, Mr. Palahniuk shows us both the good and bad of that view. We see what can happen to a man when he is told what he should live for. We can see the montony of a life that goes around in an endless circle with only pipe dreams of what is termed success. We can see how success by definition is measured by furniture and clothing and what is between the pages in a catalog and how much of it you can get. Or more over, how much of it can get you.<br /><br />But behind all this we see Tyler Durden emerge. He is a man bent on breaking out of this shell and living for a higher purpose. At times, we see that he is right and at others we see that he is pure lunacy. In his disenfranchisement from this modern world, he provides acceptance to others who seek something more. The reader can identify with these men, either in a good way or bad way. But either way, you end up choosing a side and becoming engaged in stopping Tyler or promoting Project Mayhem.<br /><br />The ending is climatic and the movie follows rather closely to the book. The book is an eye opening experience in to what we call success and what the true measure of a man is.<br /><br />For more on Chuck Palahniuk and other authors similar to him, I recommend visiting his website.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|I've seen a lot of bad reviews for this item and I am shocked.  This band has evolved so much and become such a tight group.  I know the bad reviews are coming from the people that own Californication and By the Way and nothing else.  Don't get me wrong- those albums rock, but there's so much more to the Chili Peppers.  Stadium Arcadium takes everything they've done and mixes it into their best work yet.  Flea has his same old rockin' riffs with a few excellent spots where he gets to rock it out.  Anthony is in my opinion the best singer around right now and really shows it on this album. Chad Smith shows once again that he's one of rock's best drummers, and John really lights it up. John did so much stuff on this album that has never been used by the band before and its good stuff.  He brought back guitar solos to the album and really put his heart into the music.  I could go on forever about these guys, but I will stop. I just really wanted to clear up all that crap written by those morons and let you true fans and new fans know that this is the album to get. Best album I've ever heard.
0385336691|5.0|Jack Reacher, the hero of the Lee Child thrillers is a unique creation. He is introduced in KILLING FLOOR, the first novel, as a drifter who wanders into a town with no past and no future. He combats the forces of evil and moves on. This is pretty much the formula of the succeeding books except for THE ENEMY which takes place in 1990 when Reacher worked as an MP in the US Army. This book gives more insight into his past than any of the others. With the publication of THE HARD WAY, Lee Child takes Reacher back into familiar territory of doing good and disappearing once again. <br /> Reacher, while sitting in a cafe in lower Manhattan is approached by a man who asks him if he witnessed who got into a Mercedes parked in front of the same cafe the day before. Reacher, who never misses a detail, remembers enough information that the man requests that he speak to his boss. Edward Lane, a retired soldier who has surrounded himself with a half dozen military types. Lane tells Reacher his wife and stepdaughter have been kidnapped and the man he saw getting into the car was collecting a ransom. Given Reacher's ex-military police history, Lane asks him to help locate them. Reacher agrees to work for Lane but soon discovers that this may not have been a routine kidnapping. As Reacher investigates, he finds himself embroiled in a very complex investigation full of red herrings and surprises. <br /> Lee Child has never written a bad book and this one is no exception. Reacher is unique- a man with a little known past and no apparent future who wants for nothing except the clothes on his back and a solid pair of shoes.  Hollywood has already come knocking in the form of Tom Cruise and Paramount Pictures.  It is this character of Reacher, the ultimate thriller hero-strong, silent and deadly, that makes these books so compelling. That and the clever twists of the plot. Reacher is a perfect companion for your summer reading.
1594200440|3.0|A Short History of Tractors in Ukrainian contains many excellent elements.  The author's sense of the diction of Eastern Europeans both in and out of their own language is excellent.  Her understanding of the depths of passion and desperation they have felt in their history over the past century is acute.  The contrasts she provides between their lives and the lives of modern day Englishpeople are apt. <br /> <br />Two flaws, though, marred the book for me.  First, the plot is obvious and telegraphed.  Old, vulnerable man is taken advantage of by scheming, insincere, unfaithful woman with large [...].  Guess what happens?  Guess how his daughters respond.  Guess whether he eventually comes to his senses.  Do you really need to read the book to find all this out? <br /> <br />The other is that the character of Vera, the older daughter, is hardly a character at all.  Seen almost entirely through the eyes of the narrator, younger daughter Nadia, her reactions to nearly everything are trite and over the top. <br /> <br />The remarkable thing about this book is that Lewycka almost overcomes both faults.  She tries mightily to put some humanity into Valentina, the golddigger, mainly through the device of bringing back her ex-husband from Ukraine.  He is a marvelous character and the novel breathes whenever he is present in it.  But eventually when the two return to Ukraine with their two children, driving a comical Rolls Royce with a large electric cooker (i.e., stove) on top, having stolen Nadia's mother's pressure cooker (which Nadia does nothing to stop) you can tell that there would be no redemption, she was going to do it again when she got her figure back after her pregnancy, leaving him with an infant he hadn't fathered. <br /> <br />Lewycka also tries to redeem Vera by hinting at a vague trauma in a Nazi work camp where she was the youngest inmate, something involving cigarettes which neither Vera nor Nikolai will describe to Nadia.  But their reconciliation in the light of this after the father moves out of the family home seems just too contrived.  Often we wish novels would be edited better and made shorter.  Perhaps this one could have benefited by being edited to make it just a tad longer, so that Vera could have been fleshed out more. <br /> <br />The book is short, and even with just three stars, I recommend it for its veracity of tone and its moments of wit.  I just wish it could have overcome its flaws.
0385336691|5.0|Lee Child's novels featuring Jack Reacher constitute one of my absolute favorite series of books. The constant, agonized waiting for the next installment to be released reminds me of nothing so much as my childhood memories of the painful, yet hopeful, long vigil until Christmas morning that is also known as the month of December. Now that I am a little older, if none the wiser, I must admit that choosing between a Christmas morning and a new Jack Reacher novel would be a seriously tough call. Yet, with any series that reaches ten novels, there is always the risk that sucessive novels may not feature all of the magic of the proceeding ones so it was with some trepidation and caution that I clutched my new novel, the Hard Way, to my chest and crept out on my back porch on Wednesday afternoon. All of about two pages into this book I knew I needn't have worried. This is as good, if not better, than any of the books that have come before.<br /><br />I didn't leave my porch for another eight hours. I couldn't. There were no stops for food, no bathroom breaks, no distractions permitted at all. This was an absolute mesmerizing book, one that when you say \\"I couldn't put it down\\" you actually mean that literally. I briefly had to get up to turn on a reading light as the stars came out, but I kept the book clutched in one hand, marking my place, while I did so.<br /><br />If you love the Reacher series you will delight in this new novel. Reacher, a thinking man's tough guy, is a seriously tough man. A formidable combination of brawn and brains, yet absolutely authentic, a complete personality with his own quirks, foibles, and eccentricities who seems as real as a friend or close neighbour and nothing like the plastic, two dimensional protagonists who populate so many of today's bestsellers.<br /><br />In this outing Reacher is swept into a kidnapping, one involving the disappearance of the wife of a retired special forces officer who just happens to run a private military corporation and who maintains a half dozen special forces soldiers as his retinue. While tough and skilled in combat these troops don't have the investigative background that will help them solve the mystery of the kidnapping before the likely murder of the wife. Reacher is hired as an investigator and the story, already fast-paced, explodes from there and rockets along to a grimly satisfying denouement as we have come to expect from Child novels.<br /><br />Child writes with a directness and surety of prose that sometimes reminds me of a detailed pen and ink sketch; one that with it's starkness and clean lines is more powerful and honest than the color portrait it may serve as a model for. There is no mistaking when you are reading a Jack Reacher novel for Child's tradecraft bears a distinctive voice that indelibly stamps every paragraph and page.

B000ASAEQW|4.0|This production of Mozart's last opera Die Zauberflote is a very wonderful production and is a must-buy for anyone who loves this opera. Wolfgang Swallish does a wonderful job conducting and the orchestra is amazing. The cast is pretty good. After the first few main characters the list flops into a list of nobody's.  Francisco Arazia as Tamino is (as always) wonderful. Edita Gruberova is one of the greatest queen's ever. Kurt Moll is a very solemn singer and takes his tempos very slow but forms them into a work of art. Lucia Popp is a good Pamina but didn't quite spark my interest (she looked a little to old to play Pamina). All the secondary characters were good and fit there parts well. A big peeve of mine was that they cut out the 2 priests 2nd act duet, but I can live without it. A good idea was the sequencing of the 2nd acts 1st few scenes. I thought it was a really good idea. Overall very good performance. A bit dry and generic in places but very good and monumental production.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|Stadium Arcadium is an awesome collection of songs across 2 discs.  I, like many others, cannot understand negative reviews for this set....which are relatively few and far between.  SA covers every style of music RHCP have ever recorded.  Trust me.  SA will have at least 6 hits off of it.  There are no fillers on the album.  If you are a Chili Peppers fan buy this disc.  It, along with Pearl Jam's new one, will be THE album of 2006.  I wouldn't be surprised to see RHCP and Pearl Jam battle it out for Best Album Of The Year at the various awards shows.  Can't wait to see them out on the road.  Long live the Peppers.

B000EWBKM6|2.0|WARNING: SPOLIER AHEAD WARNING: SPOLIER AHEAD WARNING: SPOLIER AHEAD    After 8 years on the air, \\"Will & Grace\\" ended its run with one big anticlimax.  While the opening dream sequence was amusing, it ran too long and the episode relied too much on the theme it set and exists as several underwelming fast forward that tells us that Will and Grace had no contact with each other for close to 20 years and are only reunited via an absurd and totaly unbelievable coincidence.  The closing scene of Will, Grace, jack and Karen drinking a toast many years from now would have had considerably more power had it not been for the preceding hour.  Lackluster and not very satisfying.
B000EJ9MTW|4.0|I saw a review that described Wolfmother's sound as a mix of Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, and White Stripes. I'd say that's fairly accurate, if unimaginative, and I'd switch Sab with Deep Purple and add a helping of stoner rock and psychedelia. The point is, old is the new new, and Wolfmother is taking the current retro shtick of young energetic rockers and blasting off to new heights. It's trendy stuff that's built on the past, but it's hard to figure if Wolfmother is creatively using old goodies as a foundation for greatness, or just mashing up a bunch of old stereotypes into a slightly new-fangled hodgepodge. In addition to thinking big, the band's real talent lies in combining all kinds of rock styles into a reasonably cohesive sound, and the stylistic changes work bodaciously in the underachieving epic \\"White Unicorn,\\" and the accurately titled \\"Colossal,\\" a track that promises great future achievements in rock hugeness. The retro rock workouts also give a real kick to other stompers like \\"Dimension\\" and \\"Love Train.\\" However, all is not well with the kitchen-sink approach to Wolfmother's songwriting, as can be seen in the clumsy rave-up \\"Apple Tree\\" or the over-ambitious \\"Joker & the Thief.\\" Meanwhile, Andrew Stockdale is showing signs of greatness as a charismatic frontman, but he needs to drop all the Jack White-isms, both on vocals and guitar. But in the end, Wolfmother has loads of potential, and they'll have long-term staying power as soon as they shed the need for trendiness. [~doomsdayer520~]
0312995423|3.0|Professor type, young dame, old wise and evil man, and technical stuff involving math and other items most people do not know: that is the basic formula of Dan Brown books. This one is no exception.<br /><br />Here it involves the ultimate computer, with the ultimate computer minds, doing the ultimate evil -- watching everything we do. And, taking over the world? Or, somehting like that.<br /><br />People who worked in computers for NSA say this is not accurate. Duhhhh!!! Doesn't everyone get it yet -- Brown writes fiction.  Like how many hot women,  who are smarter than any CalTech grad, have the hots for older professorialtypes -- who is about the age of their fathers -- and detest the hunk of a man who has the same interests and passions for computers and happens to share a secluded office space where no eyes are watching? Please -- it is fiction already. Got that men in robes.<br /><br />Fiction is fiction -- and the thought that it may be related to the real thing makes it more engrossing.

B0000027RL|5.0|There's no doubt that Ten is just about every Pearl Jam fan's favorite from them. I for one, don't think so, and I've even talked some trash on it from time to time, but after listening to it fully and in detail for the first time in, well, years, I can say it really does live up to all the hype. This coming a mere 15 years after Ten was originally released.<br /><br />My neighbor is actually the one who got me completely hooked on PJ. The song that got me hooked? Big surprise here, Even Flow. I was young and impressionable, sure, but right when I heard that song everything clicked. Ed's voice was (is) spot on, the breakdown in the middle of the song felt (feels) right, basically from that point on PJ was one of my favorite bands.<br /><br />For me, Pearl Jam can do no wrong. Call me jaded, call me dumb, whatever, I love them.  However, I can admit when something they do isn't great. Pearl Jam isn't infallible, they're not prone to the ocassional slip-up. Take Riot Act, there's a couple of PJ's best songs on there, but it probably is my least favorite album of theirs. Having said that, I just think a couple of the heavier songs on Ten, while good, could've been so much better. Why Go has an amazing guitar solo, albeit a short one, but Ed's vocals seem to be a bit lacking. I like Porch now after repeated listens, but I still think there's something missing, I just don't know what.<br /><br />For PJ fans, this should probably be the first CD of theirs you buy simply because you see where it began. In reality you have everything here a rock lover would need in a CD, you have the hard rock song, the radio staples, the heartbreaking ballad, and all the others that didn't get airplay that are still just as good.<br /><br />My favorite songs are Once, Even Flow, Alive, Garden, and Release. Ten isn't my favorite PJ CD by any means, but I still love every minute of it and it still gets mass amounts of play to this day. Pearl Jam is one of those bands that changes, drastically sometimes, with each new CD. Ten is the classic CD, Vs. is the amazing follow-up CD, Vitalogy is the exerimental CD, Yield is the return to form CD, No Code is the hidden gem CD, Binaural is the CD you love or hate, Riot Act is the hit or miss CD, and now, the self-titled Pearl Jam, is the rocker CD. Pearl Jam has more than proved their worth, and it's always nice to go back and listen to a CD that influenced you so much.astically sometimes, with each new CD.

0375830995|5.0|What a good book! From the beginning Robbery to the final scene I Am The Messenger is the kind of book which you just can not put down. I personally loved the book. Everything seemed realistic to me. The characters were all interesting and complexly different. Some you loved while others you despised. The Doorman is quite an enchanting character for being a coffee-drinking dog. I would definitely reccomend this book for anybody.
B000E1155E|5.0|Going solely on the Blender Magazine's write-up (they gave it 5 stars), I bought the album.  I have heard of Artic Monkeys just in passing not paying much attention to any \\"hype\\" given to them until I read the write-up in Blender.  Blender stated, \\"Arctic Monkeys Britain's most contagious export since Mad Cow Disease are just a bunch of small-town lads with bad haircuts ... who made the best rock album of '06.\\"  I don't know if it is the best CD of '06 since there is a lot of '06 left but it is a very good album.  Artic Monkeys' sound is a cross between punk and mainstream pop.  All songs have great rhythm and lyrics.  It is fun and snappy.  I'm glad I bought it.  My favorite songs are \\"riot van\\" and \\"mardy bum\\", they both have really good tone and sound, but all the songs are good.  It will most likely be in my top 10 CDs of 2006.  Take a chance and get it, I think you will like it
0375703764|5.0|Since most of the reviews before this have already tried to explain the plot/structure of this novel, I won't bother (it's something you have to read a few pages of to understand anyway). I was skeptical about the book upon purchase, but I was instantly hooked once I opened it. A few people have described the book as a slow read, but it was just the opposite for me. I would always pick the book up before bed, intending to read about thirty pages, only to find myself still awake at 4 a.m. with another two hundred pages under my belt.  I read the book in about four days, and even now having finished it I still go back to re-read certain sections for the purpose of understanding/interpretation. I don't think everyone will like it, but if you're a horror fan (which I am), I truly believe this is worth looking at. Occasionally I found myself a bit turned off by the slightly pretentious nature of the book (ex. dozens of pages that have only one word on them to capture the atmosphere of what is happening), but I was easily able to overlook such a slight irk since each story being told is so compelling. Johnny Truant annoyed me at first, but his slow descent into madness ultimately makes him a fascinating and extremely sympathetic character. As for the story of the Navidsons, I can't remember the last time a tale kept me up so late night after night.  <br /> <br />I've heard this book referred to as \\"existentialist horror,\\" and I believe that such a title is fitting.The book, when all is said and done, raises way more questions than it answers, but that's really the fun of it. \\"House of Leaves\\" is a book that will fuel discussion for quite some time amongst its readers which, in my opinion, is what the best books do. It might be a love it or hate it type of book, but I rest firmly in the former group, and I can't recommend this book enough.
B000002J03|5.0|this band is one of the most influential, talented, and skilled bands to ever enter the hard rock scene. most of the idiots who gave this album any less than four stars is a gay mtv moron who completeley limits himself from the music outside of mtv. now here's my review for each song. <br /> <br />1.Whole Lotta Love 10/10: classic zeppelin. great opening riff and i like the wierd sound effects near the end. <br />2.What is and What Should never be 10/10: i like the whole soft to heavy pattern this song goes through. i especially like that heavy riff that comes after the solo. <br />3.Lemon song 10/10: the riffs to this song are very catchy, bluesey and cool.  <br />4.Thank You 10/10: very heartfelt song. this is perfect to sing to a girl who you want to impress!!!!!! this is some very impressive acoustic work. <br />5.Heartbreaker 10/10: another classic song. <br />6.Living loving Maid (she's just a woman) 9/10: good song <br />7.Ramble on 10/10: very catchy song. <br />8.Moby Dick 10/10: wow!!!! this has one of the greatest drum solos ever recorded. one of Bonham's best drum performances. <br />9.Bring It On Home 10/10: great way to end the album. i like how it starts out as a blues song and explodes into this awsome hard rocker. <br />well that's my review. let mtv burn in hell!!!!!!!!!!! let true rock n roll live forever.
0345350499|5.0|The Mists of Avalon is a beautifully written novel chronicling the lives and loves of the famous women of Arthurian legend. Morgaine of the Fairies, eternally misunderstood by conventional sources, tells her recollection of the events leading to the rise and fall of the High King of Camelot. Surrounded by a rich cast of characters, including Arthur, Gwenhwyfar, Lancelot, and the mysterious Lady of the Lake, the tragic heroine recounts her heavy destiny as a disgraced priestess of Avalon fighting against the Christianizing forces overtaking her beloved Britannia. Feminist in ideology and spiritual in nature, the novel is genuinely influenced by the personal life and beliefs of author Marion Zimmer Bradley. The only slight flaw is the inconsistent pacing of the story towards the latter half.  Though arguably more fascinating, the heavily plot-driven conclusion contrasts sharply with the deliberate and contemplative flow of early tale.

B000EMGAOY|1.0|Californication part 2 without any of the great songs.
B000EMGAOY|4.0|I can't tell you how excited I was to hear this album. 2-CDs worth of new music from one of my favorite all-time bands! Unlike many, I prefer their evolution of style to a more slow and melodic type of sound as opposed to the hardcore in your face type of funk/rap/rock (whatever you wanna call it) that they virtually invented. They certainly don't disappoint here! There's a little bit of everything to sink your teeth into, and only a little bit of what I would call \\"throw away\\" material. But that tends to happens with 2-disc albums. These are the best songs, in my view (with a * for my personal fav's): <br /> <br />Disc 1: (Jupiter) <br /> <br />Dani California <br />*Snow (Hey Oh) <br />*Stadium Arcadium <br />Hump de Bump <br />*Slow Cheetah <br />Strip My Mind <br />Warlocks <br />C'mon Girl <br />*Wet Sand <br /> <br />Disc 2 (Mars) <br /> <br />*Tell Me Baby <br />*Hard to Concentrate <br />She Looks to Me <br />*Readymade <br />So Much I  <br />Storm in a Teacup <br /> <br />
B000EWBKM6|5.0|I was never so moved than I was when Karen and Jack sang that beautiful song \\"Unforgettable\\". I can think of only two other series which ended as perfectly..Six Feet Under and Sex in the City. This is without a doubt a must DvD for all Will and Grace fans, if only for that moment at the piano. I taped it, but honestly, I will watch it over and over to hear those two sing again. Bravo Will and Grace writers. To all the actors, thank you and to you fans wondering, is it worth it? Without any doubt.
B0002TX4QQ|3.0|I liked the book. It was well written, it kept our attention but there was a major flaw.  Affluent, itelligent and well informed parents  as they seemed to be would seek professional help for Kevin.  It was clear he was a freak and a mean one.  After his attack on the sister any mother would seek help, would talk about the matter with someone, a priest, a friend, a close relation but there was no one, the family lived in total seclusion.  Truth be told, I am south-american and from what I see on films and books, american families are very different from us: we cry, we shout, we kiss and we are always there for a son or a parent but american familes seem to keep everything locked up: they don't cry when a loved one dies, they don't try to console one another in a family crisis but even so, it does not seem possible that a father and a mother with a son like Kevin would let things go so far without seeking help, even from Dr. Phil!!!!
B000ETQRCM|5.0|Pearl Jam's 8th studio album is a work of the most sincere powerful art put into music since Radiohead's 'OK Computer'. Yes this album has a hard edge to it but softens it out through the album. All the good reviews you're reading are right.. This album could & should make Pearl Jam the biggest band in the world again. I can't believe some of the people here giving this album bad reviews - They know nothing. <br /> <br />A+ <br /> <br />10 out of 10
B0007OASII|5.0|Elvis Presley had five singles in the top 20 of 1956.  What does Elvis in 1956 have to do with Kamelot?  I'll tell you.  I remember hearing those five songs on the radio when they were released.  I have listened to music nearly every day of the half century that has passed since then.  In other words, I have heard a whole bunch of singers come and go.  Khan, the lead vocalist of Kamelot, is the best I've heard.<br /><br />All 11 tracks (I'm ignoring the three short interludes) provide excellent listening enjoyment.  The first track may be the best - with some fine growling by the devil, impressive power drumming and the best pinch harmonics going - and rates as a close second to my favorite song, Metropolis Part I by Dream Theater.  On the third track, a song which is connected to their previous album Epica and begins with the words of the title, Khan has some help from Simone Simons of the group Epica, their voices combining beautifully.<br /><br />No fluff resides in the lyrics of this album.  The songs concern life, death, love, the possibility of a hereafter and even the Crucifixion.  The subjects are treated seriously with pure poetry.  Some examples are: \\"Rules without exception last eternally/Every move you make creates your destiny\\" (track 2); \\"And we strive for the flame as if death was our aim\\" (Soul Society); \\"Once my ignorance was bliss/Nightfall came/Like a serpent's kiss\\" (Abandoned).  These guys can write!<br /><br />Add this all together and the result has to be in my top five as listed on my profile.  As stated there, I don't know how to  decide which of the five is my absolute favorite, but if forced to make a selection, I think this might be the one.  (Please see my profile for a brief discussion of my rating philosophy.)
B00005JOFQ|4.0|\\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is a film based on a story of the same name, written by author E. Annie Proulx. This controversial film received quite a bit of talk when it was first released and it was the subject of many jokes by comedians of all types. The idea of two cowboy types who fall in love while working at a mountain ranch was just too irresistible to many and it made Brokeback Mountain the common [...] (no pun intended) of many jokes.<br /><br />Today, many months after its initial release, much of the hoopla has died down. Brokeback Mountain has now been released on DVD and this provided me my opportunity to watch this movie and see what the fuss was all about. I already knew the film received rave reviews and it was nominated for many Oscars, taking home three of them before the Academy Awards wrapped up the 2005 awards evening. But would Brokeback Mountain live up to the hype, I wondered, or would it be an idiotic mess of unrealistic events, stupid one- liners, and a case of \\"pushing\\" an issue (in this case, gay themes and rights) on the viewer?<br /><br />Now that I have watched this movie in its entirety, I am happy to report that Brokeback Mountain contains none of the negative qualities I described above. Director Ang Lee presents a movie that is tastefully made and that doesn't push any social agenda. Yes, the film does portray many adult scenes (like gay sex and straight sex), but it is done in as tasteful a way as possible. What takes place in this movie is probably not very far- fetched at all for the time period that it covers (1963 to 1981) and there are likely many viewers who will be able to relate directly to the plot of this movie and the confusion and frustration felt by its lead characters and their families as they struggle to sort out their feelings. Ennis and Jack have obvious feelings for each other but they feel they must keep their affair secret. They have families to support and they want to be seen as \\"normal\\" by those around them. Jack is more aggressive and he pushes Ennis to join him and start a permanent relationship. But Ennis resists and the strain it places on them and their respective families is significant and the emotional pain on the screen is openly visible.<br /><br />Ang Lee does a superb job directing this film and its no surprise that he won the Oscar for Best Director. The cinematography is excellent, with great scenes of the vast Rocky Mountains as they majestically pierce the bright blue skies above them. The direction he takes this film is nearly flawless as it follows the two main characters on their path from lustful attraction, to emotional involvement, to resistance and beyond. Intertwined are the problems experienced on the home front. Both men get married and start families, in spite of their obvious attraction to each other. Like many people during that era, they probably did this because it was assumed to be the right thing to do. But the difficulties it causes their two families are obvious, with Ennis' character experiencing the greatest domestic turmoil of the two. Not only does Ennis get divorced, he even allows himself to get involved in another relationship with a woman; this, in spite of the fact that he knows where his true interest and feelings lie.<br /><br />Heath Ledger plays Ennis Del Ray and his performance is near perfect. Ledger is only twenty- six years old but he plays the part of a man who is (at the end of the movie) in his forties. The make- up, the talk, and the attitude that Ledger projects into this character are very real and it's easy to see why he, too, was nominated for an Oscar. It took me a while to get used to Ennis' voice because he talks like someone with a hunk of chewing tobacco in his mouth. I had to replay some of the scenes to pick up on what he was saying. But the character was like this for a reason, most likely to make him similar to those who work in this type of occupation. Jake Gyllenhaal's character, Jack Twist, is very different from Ennis. He is more of a straight talker who says exactly what is on his mind and proceeds to work toward his goals. Gyllenhaal's performance isn't quite as good as Ledger's but it is still notable and still memorable.<br /><br />One thing I noticed about Brokeback Mountain is that it took me some time to warm- up to the main characters. They seemed so distant and casual about the whole thing at first that it was difficult to care what was going on. I found myself feeling more sympathetic toward the families who had to deal with the volatility of their respective fathers/husbands on a daily basis. However, as the film nears its end, the frustration felt by Jack and the stubbornness of Ennis got me more involved with the characters. I just wanted them to finally make up their minds one way or the other and it was much easier at this point to feel the frustration felt by Jack as he tried to persuade his friend that he wanted their relationship to be more than just a seasonal fling.<br /><br />Brokeback Mountain is a very good motion picture that will be remembered for years as one of 2005's best pictures. The cinematography, the performances, and the directing are all top- notch and the story of forbidden love is engaging and vivid. The film will likely remain controversial for its subject matter but regardless of your own personal feelings on this type of subject, \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is a film I recommend watching. It presents a realistic look at what people who lived this life often experienced back when alternative lifestyles weren't as accepted as they are today.ent from Ennis.

B0009RCPY8|5.0|If there is one film, and one cartoon spawned from said film, that takes up the most amount of room in my childhood memories it has to be, without a doubt, the Ghostbusters franchise.    The cast works together so well that it's almost as if this movie was created, by whatever higher being, to present the very definition of a perfect, cohesive cast.    It revolves around the daily lives of Peter Venkman (Bill Murray), Ray Stantz (Dan Aykroyd), Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis), Winston Zeddmore (Ernie Hudson) and their secretary Janine (Annie Pots).  When they receive a call from aone Dana who reports odd behavior occuring in her fridge Venkman, the pseudosmooth ladies man, falls head over heels, and does his best to get Dana give the guy a chance.  The comedy is given an extra layer with the introduction of Louis Tully, played masterfully by Rick Moranis, Dana's health obsessed, neurotic neighbor.    Co-written by Aykroyd and Ramis, originally just written by Aykroyd Ramis was brought in to add smarts and sarcasm, and directed by Ivan Reitman, this film still stands up today, and in most cases, stands above most comedies.  The special effects are still amazing, even compared to the likes of, say the Lord of the Rings films.  The ghosts seem real, and not computer generated, so that addds yet even more to the movie.    I could go on and on forever about this movie, and it's sequel, but if you've seen it you know everything i'm about to say, and if you haven't seen it, for the love of god, drop what you're doing and rent this/buy it/steal it from someone, because it will be well worth your time.
B000F3AAUW|4.0|this is cd is SO GOOD! gnarls has a crazy unique voice. <br />awesome beats, awesome lyrics, awesome music! there's a couple of songs i don't care for but the rest makes up for it!  <br />very ORIGINAL!  awesome and sick. hopefully he doesn't get overplayed on pop radio!!
B0006A9FMI|1.0|Actually, I wish Amazon would allow for two ratings ... one for the movie itself, and one for the DVD.  Fantastic movie, horrendous DVD transfer by DreamWorks.  As has been stated by everyone here, the way DreamWorks has handled this movie is shameful and beyond disappointing.   <br /> <br />Do NOT buy this DVD ... it simply is not worth parting with your hard earned cash.  Either rent it or find a away to watch the newly released Australian or UK releases (~March 2006) which have DD 5.1 and DTS 5.1 English voice-over tracks.
B0000029DD|5.0|I am convinced that if Jeff Buckley were still alive today, the world would be a better place. The legacy that he left behind with this single finished studio album and a collection of live and posthumously released unfinished studio recordings is incredible. There are few songwriters that are overflowing with as much emotion, soul, power and finesse as Buckley. Grace is an enchanting album from an amazing voice in American pop music.<br /><br />The thing that distinguishes Buckley from everyone else is his voice. It is one of the most dynamic voices I have EVER heard. He belts with power from the bellows of his respritory organs on \\"Mojo Pin\\" and \\"So Real,\\" he croons with his cherubic falsetto on \\"Lilac Wine\\" and \\"Corpus Christi Carol,\\" climbs the ladder to the apex of his vocal range on \\"Lover You Should Have Come Over,\\" and effortlessly hums out his warm midrange on Leonard Cohen's \\"Hallelujah,\\" and wails his lungs out in a pitched scream on tracks like \\"Grace\\" and \\"Eternal Life.\\" Never have I heard a singer that can sing with so much style and emotion and use just about every possible tambre the human voice has to offer. Buckley truly exhibits the unmatchable versitility of his voice on this classic album.<br /><br />Buckley's songwriting is the other incredibly remarkable aspect of his work on this album. The songs on this album are just incredibly epic. There is really no other word to describe the gems on this recording. The songs are creative, resisting the urge to be generic or derivative. Buckley, while he has drawn from many influences, is one of few musicians who really has a truly individual sound. The songs are musically interesting and paired with evocative, poetic lyrics to create a sonic pleasure.  The use of Indian Tabla Drums and Vibes on \\"Dream Brother\\" makes for a haunting conclusion on the album. His interpretation of Leonard Cohen's \\"Hallelujah\\" is astounding and makes a very nice change of pace in the album as an exposed track of just guitar and vocals. His interpretation of Benjamin Britten's Corpus Christi Carol is amazing as well.<br /><br />This album is an absolute essential for any lover of good music. There is something for everyone. Buckley made a wonderful gem in 1994 that should be appreciated by many for decades.tar and vocals.

B000063TQW|4.0|When I first saw this movie with my teenage son, I admit that my expectations were not particularly high. Was I ever pleasantly surprised by this delightfully funny comedy! Reese Witherspoon does a star turn as the not so dumb, California airhead blonde, Ellie Woods, who is dumped by her college sweetheart, Warner, before graduation, instead of getting the anticipated and expected marriage proposal. It appears that he has political aspirations and an ostensibly dumb and flamboyant blonde is not what he envisions having for a wife.<br /><br />Seeking to prove herself worthy and knowing that he is planning on attending Harvard Law School, Ellie, a fashion major, also seeks admission with dogged determination and studies her charming buns off in order to do well on the LSAT, the Law School Admission Test. Her high LSAT scores, coupled with her hilarious admission video, and her perfect college grade point average, albeit in Fashion, get her through the portals of Harvard Law School, and the games begin in earnest.<br /><br />What happens to her at Harvard is hilarious, as Ellie tries to get her former sweetheart back. She discovers, instead, something about herself that ultimately makes others sit up and take notice of her in a positive way. Reese Witherspoon is delightfully funny doing a comic turn and will have the viewer laughing almost immediately, while rooting for her. The supporting cast is likewise enjoyable. This is a funny, wacky comedy that is never mean spirited and is, instead, surprisingly uplifting.
0060977493|5.0|Amazing book- one of my all time favorites. She is a brilliant writer, and her writing defies norm. It's a brilliant portrayal of deprived family, and an anguishing exhibition of the power of the powerless.  <br /> <br />Not for those who prefer hallmark cards embossed with a little girl in a flower hat and a little boy in suspenders- kissing each other. It's less pleasant and more disturbing than that.
B000EULJLU|3.0|Thats what I thought when I first heard this. <br />So many times I was waiting for these songs to break out, becoming more expansive in epic scope both musically and lyrically.  It failed to happen. <br /> <br />Maynard's performance seems quite surpressed. Not sure why. <br /> <br />None of the songs manage to evoke a response or emotion that I received from lateralus.  I will never forget when I first heard grudge,  I was so pumped up I started screaming. <br /> <br />The next song on lateralus 'the patient'  I remember how the song evolved musically and lyrically into sureal epic proportions. <br /> <br />Just those two songs alone blow away any of the song produced on 10,000 days.  Just go back and listen. <br /> <br />This album did not offer up the emotion and power that tool is capable of. <br /> <br />Do not get me wrong, I like the album and I love TOOL, but I guess after waiting five years I expected something more immortal. <br /> <br />This album proves that Tool is human. <br />
B000ENWKN8|3.0|Alright so you know who you're talking to, I'm a huge fan of old White Zombie, Rob Zombie, Pantera, Tool and Slipknot. Yeah yeah, I know what you're thinking, Slipknot is a bunch of posers, I'm an old schooler, but most bands are hard pressed to beat Slipknot in overall sheer power, rage and speed in metal. They may be young, but they're music is hard core. So on to this CD, read on, I'm giving impressions to these songs as I listen to them.   <br /> <br />American Witch...stood the hairs up on my arms. Maybe a bit repetitive, but absolutely Zombie and an overall badass song, high energy, it'll get your blood pumpin'. <br /> <br />Foxy Foxy...awful radio song that doesn't deserve a mention. Maybe works for a club because of the sex-appeal, but it sure as hell doesn't cut it when it comes to metal. I don't know what the hype with this song is, I really don't. <br /> <br />17 Year Locust...slow and crunchy, still has the same feel of old Zombie songs but overall not outstanding, just didn't do it for me when I felt in the metal mood. <br /> <br />The Scorpion Sleeps...the scorpion should sleep in this song because it almost put me to sleep, there are no good hardcore non-stop rifts to get the rage going.  <br /> <br />Let it All Bleed Out...a high energy song, driving, non-stop, definately makes you want to drive fast and push you to gettin' nasty with that blonde in the club after dancing to Foxy Foxy (the only use for Foxy Foxy), reminds me of Dragula.  <br /> <br />Death of it all...more a song that A Perfect Circle would release...nice song, but devoid of metal. Still very cool, more for the relaxed times. <br /> <br />Ride...another Perfect Circle-type song, which, isn't really a bad thing, I just can't see myself listening to it much when I'm in a metal mood. Cool ambience in the song, nice driving guitar when it's there...a bit of a letdown for hardcore metal heads, not a lot of substance in the lyrics either. <br /> <br />The Devil's Rejects...it's just completely a song you'd hear on a movie...not a friend of metal heads. As much as I've tried to like it, I just don't. Grungy, but doesn't have the speed or rythm of a good metal song. Nothing to make your hair stand up. <br /> <br />The Lords of Salem....Slow and Crunchy as hell... strong... driving, made my hair stand up. I turned it up for this one, the guitar and bass was awesome in this song. GREAT final song for an otherwise sort of weak release.  <br /> <br />Overall, I don't know if I could recommend this album or not. To be honest, it's not a metal head CD for the most part. Some songs are hard, but others are too movie-style. If possible, get your hands on American Witch, Let it All Bleed Out, and The Lords of Salem, they make the CD...the others just felt like filler. Regards.
B000F3AAUW|5.0|Simply put, this album is incredible.  When I first got it I listened to three or four tracks constantly, and then the brilliance of the other tracks seeped in as well.  Now I can't stop listening to it.  It's addictive. <br /> <br />Danger Mouse uses samples and tracks in this really raw way that pushes the energy forward, never lagging, and creates an atmosphere of unexpected beats and rhythms that are sometimes breathtaking. <br /> <br />Cee-Lo is the perfect vocal compliment to the music.  His voice puts soul into the songs, but in a dirty, funky kind of way.  The lyrics are straighforward enough, but they touch on things on both a personal and universal level.  One or two songs have the kind of tongue-in-cheek humor that can only happen in hip-hop.   <br /> <br />Great album.
B000AARKOO|3.0|When this movie initially came out, I got the sense that it wasn't all that great; so I waited and after finally getting around to watching it, I can safely say that I was indeed right in this respect: Kingdom of Heaven is not a good movie.  The occasional epic battle scene, superb costume design and cinematography does save the movie to a certain degree and makes it entertaining, but the story is simply not engrossing and the dialogue at times just plain irritating.   Part of the fault in this movie is the fact that it tries to put a positive twist on an unfortunate era in Western Civilization's history in order to make the movie more palatible for modern audiences (hence, more likely to make lots of money); the Crusaders essentially went to that region to butcher and slaughter in the name of God and Jesus--despite numerous verses in the Bible which clearly state this to be sinful--but of course our hero in this movie is not one of them and in the end rallies the defenders of Jerusalem by stating that the battle against Saladin is for the sake of defending the people of the city, not religion.  Give me a break.

B000EWBKM6|2.0|The way this show started out I never could have imagined it would end the way it did. I am a huge fan of the show. I mostly appreciated the slap stick physical comedy of Megan Mullalley(I know I spelled that wrong) and Shawn Hayes. The characters Karen and Jack acted much to sober. I would have liked to have seen the show end in the present. The characters Will and Grace seemed to me to be very depressed. The whole cast seemed to have lost that gusto that made them so special. Maybe I saw what was true sadness. I am sure I did to a degree. The part of WIll and Grace not keeping in touch for all of thoose years was the most disapointing of all. I mean they were like brother and sister living together all of thoose years and then the ending so blah. It spoke: so here we are all toghether and its not so great and this foursome is dead.  I know this happens in real life but Will and Grace the style of comedy-It wasent there style to end that way. I mean this is TV, are real lives can be depressing enough. I tuned into WIll and Grace to escape that as most people. ALthough all and all just about every other episode was hysterical needless to say and I would just like to convey that comedic actors have no idea what a blessing they are to the world! I just want to say thank you to all of the comedians who have truly made my world a better place. 5 stars overall to the whole cast and crew!
B000EMGAOY|4.0|Double albums just don't work.  Instead of having one album that could have been absolutely incredible, the Chili Peppers made two very good albums that sort of both lose momentum toward the end.  Still, the set has its high points.  \\"Dani, California\\"...\\"Hard to Concentrate\\"...\\"Charlie\\"...\\"Desecration Smile\\"-- \\"Stadium Arcadium\\" definitely reflects a more mature Chili Peppers and the guitar solos are pretty stellar all around.  Anthony Keidis' lyrics are mostly nonsensical but too much fun to say for it to really matter and his vocals are as strong here as they were during the \\"Californiacation\\" years.  All in all, if you love the Chili Peppers, you'll love this but (having never really been a die-hard fan myself) I was really hoping for an album that could have held my attention for the entire duration of the disc, and it really bothers me that if the band hadn't split the album into two discs, I could have had such an experience.  But oh well.  Such is life.  Enjoy.
1400079179|1.0|Da Vinci Code is more than a book.  It's more than a movie.  It's a moral contest.  Da Vinci Code is a moral contest between the Holy Roman Catholic Church and Hollywood, which seek to destroy it.  Mission Impossible III shows how anti-Catholic Hollywood is.  MI-III depicted the Vatican as absolutely corrupt, hobnobbing with rich criminals.  The Roman Catholic Church is losing the moral contest.  Da Vinci Code is one area the Roman Catholic Church has an opportunity to reassert its moral authority.  Da Vinci Code is where the Roman Catholic Church needs to win the moral contest.  If they fail, the Roman Catholic Church would enter into an era of unprecedented decline around the world.  Particularly in the USA, Roman Catholic Church is in grave decline.  In fact, Roman Catholic Church members have been the most avid supporters of Da Vinci Code.  Why?  Because the archbishops of Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Diego, Chicago, Philadelphia, New York, Boston, St. Louis, etc. have NOT taken an aggressive stance against Da Vinci Code.  Maybe the Vatican needs to pull these archbishops out of the moral contest.  It doesn't seem like they have anything left in their old bodies to put one over the Da Vinci Code.  If the moral contest is lost here before the Court of Popular Opinion, the Roman Catholic Church around the world will see an unprecedented loss of membership, apostasy, deviance.  The Holy Roman See will not be able to handle the fallout of the loss of the moral contest.  It may be the end of the Roman Catholic Church as we know it.  The loss of moral context vis-a-vis Da Vinci Code will be like suffering a nuclear attack.  How many of you have respect for the Roman Catholic Church's handling of the Da Vinci Code.  The Holy Roman Catholic Church is losing the moral contest and the hearts and minds of Catholics around the world, particularly in America.
B000EGCITG|5.0|Definitely one of her best CDs out of them all. I loved the hidden messages in the tracks. My favorites on the album are \\"Stupid Girls\\", Leave Me Alone (I'm Lonely), and \\"Cuz I Can\\". The other tracks really aren't that far behind those. This is definitely a must have.
B0006GAOBI|5.0|First off, the original release of this movie was incredible: the director's extended addition is FANTASTIC! This is one of the few times a movie improved by adding in the cut scenes (approximately 20 scattered additional minutes). The scenes that first-time writer/director Richard Kelly added enhanced the movie tremendously. The original release at the theater got off to a rough start premiering one month after 9/11 (2001) grossing only $500,000 at the box office. The nation was in mourn and this movie has an aura of gloom. It became a classic once released on DVD and gained a HUGE following. It's extremely mesmerizing and still popular.<br /><br />Most have explained a large part of the premise and theories on this thought provoking, eerie and intriguing movie. Frank, the 6-foot-tall rabbit with what looks like the head of a science-fiction insect is worth seeing alone. Jake Gyllenhaal leads an all-star cast (including his real life sister Maggie as his screen sister). Actor Patrick Swayze plays a surprising role... The movie also includes one of the best soundtracks of any movie in recent years. Definitely a MUST PURCHASE!<br /><br />FYI: Critic Roger Ebert rates this movie 3 out of 4 stars.
1594481938|3.0|Multiple reviews, including those for well-known publications have compared this book or at least mentioned it alongside The Breakfast Club. Although I can see the logic in a comparison of that sort, Hornby's novel reads more like what happened right after the day Emilio Estevez et al spent a day in detention. The four title characters, Martin, Maureen, JJ, and Jess have nothing in common other than the desire one New Year's Eve to commit suicide. The story traces the events that directly follow that evening and what causes each of them to choose not to end their lives. Although I found the story funny and stylistically well-done, contrary to what others have said about its originality, the novel falls flat. The characters, who begin as interesting as they come, soon become trapped in their own sterotypical molds. You have a mother of a child with a disability who feels uncomfortable with cursing, a musician who never really made it big, a tv personality who has fallen from grace, and the daughter of a mid-level politician who swears and causes problems for everybody with her insensitivity. The strength of the novel lies in its dialogue and Hornby's ability to draw on pop culture references and turn them on their head. As entertaining as it was, it failed to live up to his previous work such as High Fidelity, which included similar references and satire, but maintained a story and framework that still allowed all of us to care. As I raced through this book, I found myself not caring so much about what happens because not all that much does, especially in terms of character development. The Boston Sunday Globe claims this is a novel all writing students should read, but I thoroughly disagree. As great a writer as Hornby is, this novel is not some of his best work.
B000ETQRCM|1.0|I'm sorry to say I bought this CD based on hype and good reviews.  Shame on me.  It's boring.  I really can't find one song that I even sort of like on in.  Most of these reviews remind me of the fable of The Emperor's New Clothes!  Everyone is afraid to tell the truth here.  It just sucks.  I was really disappointed.. Want to buy a very slightly used CD?
B000F1IQN2|5.0|Wow!  That's the easiest way to sum up \\"Munich\\", one of Steven Spielberg's darkest films.  \\"Munich\\", based on the book 'Vengeance' (which I admittedly have not read) depicts an Israeli revenge squad that targetted and assassinated Palestinian terrorists who allegedly planned the 1972 Black September killings.    The film begins with a terrifying recreation of the Olympic Games terrorism, and then intercuts those scenes with archival news footage to set up the exposition.  Being someone who didn't even know about the Munich killings, this was very informative for me.  We soon meet Avner (Eric Bana in a terrific performance), as he is briefed by Ephraim (the always colorful Geoffrey Rush) to lead a team of five to target and eliminate the responsible Palestinians.  The team is alone, will travel the entire world to find their targets, will do the job for as long as it takes, and are not to return until they are finished.    I believe there are two fundamental subjects to address here: the style of the film, and the controversey surrounding the film.    For those who don't know what kind of movie this is (as Spielberg is a very diverse filmmaker), this can best be summed up as a thriller that eventually becomes more of a dark character study.  The first act, so to speak, is very tense and suspenseful, as we watch Avner's team setup and kill their assignments.  Spielberg has an unrelenting style to these violent sequences.  In fact, \\"Munich\\" plays off as a good espionage flick at its best, but Spielberg is one step ahead of us.  The first few assassinations are exciting and involving, because Avner's team is feeling their first adrenaline rush and possibly enjoying the thrill of the kill.  But as the mission goes one for months, things become more terrifying and dangerous.  The hunters become the hunted, allies become enemies, and beliefs becomes delusions...which brings me to the controversy.    In short, the movie allows both Israelis and Palestinians to argue both sides of the coin.  The topic is, of course, who deserves to live in Jerusalem.  \\"Munich\\" treats this as most great movies do: Nobody is 100% right, and nobody is 100% wrong.  I believe the scene that angers most critics is the one where Avner and another mercenary talk in the middle of the night, and basically agree that maybe conflict between the two factions is better than peace.  Is it because peace is unattainable?  Or is it because neither side would know what to do with absolute victory?  Questions like these, especially regarding a heated subject, get people's blood boiling.  But again, Spielberg and the writers are one step ahead of us.  This subject is supposed to get a reaction out of you.  This isn't an intellectual seminar; \\"Munich\\" is a disturbing film that doesn't play it safe.  Spielberg does not bring any sentimalism or sweetness to this movie at all.  We as viewers become more involved and allow Spielberg to command our complete attention.    The point isn't \\"Who's right?\\" - the point, according to the movie, is that both sides' followers have desensitized and corrupted their souls by allowing ideals and beliefs become extremist violence.  As \\"Munich\\" progresses, Avner's team begins to forget their Israeli beliefs, not to mention their sanity.  Their mission, which is supposed to be done out of loyalty and faith, becomes militaristic and, even worse, habitual.  My last note to political critics: If you strongly believe your point of view, then watching this movie isn't going to change your mind.  Movies like this either make you question your beliefs, or do nothing but strengthen what you already know.  What have you got to lose?  Plus, \\"Munich\\" is mostly a thriller anyway.  Just as \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is a love story and not gay-activist propaganda, \\"Munich\\" is a character study and not a political ploy.    \\"Munich\\" is a masterpiece in every way.  The cast is fantastic, particularly Bana and Rush, and Michael Lonsdale as a French informant who hasa cold yet fatherly relationship with Avner.  John Williams composes one of his more subtle musical scores, and wisely doesn't let the music undermine the action.  But this is Steven Spielberg's acheivement.  He is one of the greatest filmmakers of our time, and \\"Munich\\" is his best work in years.
0812550706|2.0|I was looking foward to reading this based on reviews. At least it was short and easy to read. Ender keeps going through the same fights, same promotions, same earnings of respect, same feelings of remorse, fighting the same mock battles, etc. Even his sister had to give him a pep-talk.....TWICE. That's a lot of repetition for such a short book.I had known about the ending already so I didn't even enjoy that so much. I may read the second. I doubt it even though I bought them together.
B000E97Y6K|1.0|I've liked what PJ has done in the past (Dead Alive, Bad Taste, LOTR, etc...), but this is the worst remake I've ever subjected myself to. I knew how the story went from the original Kong, but come on... PJ didn't have to drag on every minute of it to make it more then it already was. I really looked forward to seeing this film, but after seeing it I asked myself if it really happend and felt that I needed a hot shower to forget I ever saw it.
1401207138|5.0|One of the best novels, not just graphic novels, I've ever read. Stands up to many nights of re-reading. You can almost swim in it.<br /><br />The paperback version is equally wonderful, but if you have the extra $$$, this over-sized hardcover is worth it.
6304696558|5.0|Goldie Hawn shines in her first producing and starring role of Private Benjamin.  The hilariously funny and witty comedy proves just how versatile this stunning actress can be.  When Goldie meets her nemesis the tyrannical Captain Lewis who calls Goldie Princess the fun is just beginning.  From the time Goldie cleans the bathroom with her electric toothbrush, to whining her way out of jumping out of an airplane this is definitely one of Goldie's finest moments.  If you are Goldie Hawn fan and haven't seen this movie, you've been missing out.
B00005B1W5|5.0|This Tribute dvd by Yanni is truly a masterpiece. The quality is excellent and believe me you will want to see it over and and over again. The music is totally out of this world!!
B000EQH2QK|3.0|Shakira's latest CD is okay for a sophomore English crossover CD, but it left me nothing to be fixated about.  While she does vary from stop the style, I felt like this was one of those sequel movies that didn't live up to standard.  To me there was nothing fresh about this CD and I felt it was a bad knock off of her first crossover hit CD.
0142000655|5.0|\\"East of Eden\\" is a beautifully written, sprawling, three generation saga of the men and women who settled the Salinas Valley in California. The story begins far away in the East, on the farm of the unscrupulous Cyrus Trask and his two sons, Adam and Charles. Adam is an upright, honest young man who naturally draws people to him, while Charles has an angry, violent spirit. <br />Charles tries in vain to earn the love of his father, and takes his anger at his failure out on Adam. Adam is sent by his father into the army as a sign of his love, but Cyrus keeps Charles close to home, knowing that war would release something dangerous and violent in his other son.  <br /> <br />Adam wanders for many years across the country after his service, and some of the most lyrical passages in the book describe his life as a tramp, closely mirroring Steinbeck's own experiences during the Depression. Finally he returns to the farm and exists in uneasy partnership with Charles until the mysterious Cathy arrives. The more astute Charles quickly realizes her true nature, but innocent Adam marries her and they move to California.  <br /> <br />Adam expects Cathy to pursue his dream of life on a ranch, but Cathy is a vicious, evil character with no redeeming qualities, and after the birth of twin sons she escapes only to re-emerge much later when her sons are grown. Adam hibernates for many years on the ranch, broken-hearted over Cathy's desertion, and convinced he must hide the secret from his sons forever, which become an impossible task. Repeating the pattern of their father's life, the twins Aron and Caleb vie for their father's love, with Aron effortlessly winning it while Caleb comes to believe there is something evil lurking in his spirit. But this time around, Caleb is redeemed in a way Charles never was. <br /> <br />Steinbeck's prose is masterful, and his descriptions of the Salinas Valley, lush with the rains, brutal with the drought, capture exactly why men were drawn to thewest. His portrayals of character and motives--sadly lacking in the movie--are totally convincing, and his Adam is a flawed but admirable character.  <br /> <br />Steinbeck has been a bit out of favor--at least until this was chosen as an Oprah book. As an English-as-a-second-language teacher I recently taught \\"The Pearl,\\" and that book too surprised me with its gorgeous writing and subtle imagery. (We all read it in high school but I now realize it went right over my head.) Try Steinbeck again--you won't be disappointed--my book club wasn't!
B00005R2M3|5.0|Shakira's first crossover CD does not disappoint.  With almost every track becoming a favorite of mine this CD get you up and moving and at the very least makes time race by on the treadmill.  I highly recommend this CD for anyone who likes lively, interesting and compelling music.  Writing this CD before she spoke English, Shakira has proven that she not only has talent but a keen sense of the spoken word.  Using a dictionary to look up the words she has put spice back into a lackluster music world.
B000F0UV0E|4.0|I've had this CD for about 45 minutes and I'm into the 2nd listen...I bet by the 4th I'll be ready to give it 5 stars.  As it is, it's as good as I expected it to be from two such talented people.  \\"I Dug Up a Diamond\\" is a great song...I can see it's going to become one of my all-time favorites.  The rest of what's on the album runs the gamut from brooding to upbeat.  It's just plain good and I look forward to seeing these two in concert in June.
B000EWBKM6|5.0|I very much enjoyed the Will & Grace finale last night.  The only quibble I had was that I thought the final scene with Rosario was a little mean-spirited, if in keeping with her and Karen's generally adversarial relationship.  That's about it as far as negatives for me.  (I was also hoping we'd finally get more of a glimpse of Stan than his feet, but maybe in the reunion show...)    I liked the scene with the guy in the body cast, who \\"came out\\" with the same revelation as we've seen happen with other characters in the show.  In that sense, he reminded me of the guy who was sitting next to Will that time that he and Leo went to a sports event.  And there have been others like those two as well.    I was okay with the story taking those several big jumps into the future.  It sort of reminded me of all those films that end with text on the screen describing what eventually happened to each character.  American Graffiti is the one that comes to mind, although I've seen that same technique in numerous other films.  It was very satisfying to see some of those events portrayed on the screen rather than just to read about them.    I didn't have a big problem with Will & Grace losing touch with each other for those many years.  Believing that could happen to two such good friends did require some sort of suspension of disbelief.  And, then again, that kind of thing does happen in real life, and their long separation from each other also served to set up the situation with their becoming reunited under the unusual circumstances that they did, as well as their becoming relatives (and I thought the two actors who portrayed their college-age children were absolutely perfect, by the way).  And on the plus side, it was nice to see that Will and Grace were able to find truly fulfilling relationships (with Vince and Leo respectively), something which no doubt contributed to their losing touch with each other.    Still, the highlight of the program was the final three scenes, all of which brought us full circle from the first episode.  I couldn't watch any of them dry-eyed.    First there was the beautiful Karen-Jack scene with their singing of \\"Unforgettable,\\" which has already been commented on several times here, and which ended with the two of them repeating a gesture that was part of their first scene together.    Then there was the wonderful Grace-Will telephone scene that mirrored the very first scene of the series.  They were both watching the same television program they had been watching 20 years ago (talk about suspension of disbelief!), and some of the dialogue was identical, as well as a reference to one particular actor from that program.    The final scene took place in the same setting as the final scene of the first program, with Will choosing it as the place for the four of them to meet as he recalled what happened when they were there the last time.  His reference to the other characters who were in the original scene brought to mind all the wonderful guests, both one-time and recurring, who have been a part of the program since its beginning.  And then the last program ended with a kiss between the two title characters, just as the first program did.    The four leads appeared on the Today show the morning of the final program.  When Katie Couric (one of the many guests on Will & Grace over the years) asked them if they were satisfied with the final episode, Eric McCormack said that it was ambitious and went far beyond the endings of most sitcoms.  I found the ending completely satisfying, and just a reminder of how much I'm going to miss this modern-day version of Lucy and Ricky and Fred and Ethel.  Thank goodness that we have eight years of reruns of this ground-breaking show to always enjoy.
B000EYK4KI|5.0|I agree with the other reviewers that the studios are just screwing the fans when they release a \\"special\\" edition less than 6 months after a previous bare bones release, which most of us bought.  At least New Line had some decency when they let fans know there would be two editions of LOTR.<br /><br />However, I don't want potential movie buyers to get the wrong impression based on the starred reviews.  THIS WAS AN EXCELLENT FILM.  A good bit of tongue in cheek humor, action and explosions, and Pitt and Jolie sizzle on screen together.  If you don't already own this--get it now with all the extras.
B000EQ4G5K|1.0|RIHANNA CANNOT SANG'....I DON'T KNOW WHAT JAY-Z TRYING TO DO BUT HER ABILITY TO PUT MUSICAL NOTES WITH HER VOICE NEEDS TO BE REVAMPED AND RE-WORKED. THIS IS SO DAMN LATE!!!!!

B0000TLA9G|5.0|G'nR is amongst my favourite 80's rock bands along with JUDAS PRIEST and IRON MAIDEN.They were a great band who came out with superb songs like NOVEMBER RAIN,SWEET CHILD O MINE,PATIENCE,PARADISE CITY and WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE.I would recommend that you get this at the earliest if you are looking for all their hits on one album.
B0007GAERG|5.0|ALL I HAVE TO SAY, I LOVE MC SHE IS DOING HER DAMN THING ON THIS ALBUM...COUPLE UNRELEASED TRAKCS ARE STILL MISSING BUT ALL IN ALL LOVE THE FIRE AND BRIMSTONE SHE PUT OUT ON THIS ALBUM. SHE IS THE VOICE NO MATTER WHAT.....I JUST HOPE HER CRACKED OUT COUNTER-PART COMES BACK ALSO SO SHE CAN LET THE MEDIA HAVE IT BECAUSE TO ME SHE IS THE PERFECT VOICE.
B000F6IOBQ|1.0|this movie was sooo untalented..as was the first one..you people who said it was a good movie, must not appreciate films like i do...i really ddint want to see it but some friends wanted to go..so chessy and just retarded..evolution wants to be the matrix soo bad..the black. the slow photography..cantr hollywood get creative..they are always copying other movies or redoing old ones..cant they think of anything new?????
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This show was by far the best television show ever made!  It had everything you could ever want in a show - humor, catchy sayings, guns, fighting(even sword fights), love, and more! <br />The writing was fresh and funny, the characters are diverse, and the actors are incredibly talented.    <br />Do yourself a favor and check out this series!  (You'll want to keep it forever!) <br />
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I love this show, and its music. The singers are phenominal!! Its wonderful to hear the two female lead voices so different in a show together. The Chenowith's soprano agaist Menzel's crazy great high belt is awesome. Their voices are great the music is exciting and the story is engaging. Can't wait to see it!
0786852550|4.0|I heard that this book was really good, came highly recommended. I was a little skeptical at first about reading it, but I gotta say, \\"WOW\\". This book is really really good. I couldn't put it down. I adored Bartimus humor. I highly recommend this book. Can't wait to read the next two. <br /> <br />
B000957O82|4.0|This film was totally entertaining to me. I love Will Smith and think he did a great job. So many people I know wanted to hate the film but ended up loving it.
0316172324|3.0|So I read this book on everybody in the world's recommendation and I have to say I was far from impressed. I think most people like this book because it's like sitting back in a bar and shooting the breeze with some buddies. Gladwell, in basically every case he brings up, writes about some case of a successful person and talks about how \\"everyone loved him from the first second\\" or some other anecdote like that. They're all interesting stories, but the conclusions you can take from this book are little if any. Every single one of these cases involve post-hoc hypotheses, something that is a deal breaker in any scientific community.     But he's a good writer. So a fun read. Just take it with a grain of salt.
B000268QB2|5.0|I really think this album is brilliant. Each song takes us in an unique atmosphere, without the songs be the same to each other. <br /> <br />Somewhere Only We Know - The 1st song I heard from Keane, an excellent song, but not the best yet. <br /> <br />This Is The Last Time - A very good melody bears the song making it souding very good with the vocals. <br /> <br />Bend & Break - I thought this song was a bit like TITLT, in the same genre but it's a good energic song you'll like. <br /> <br />We Might As Well Be Strangers - A nice little slow-paced rythm with Tom's nice vocals making it right. <br /> <br />Everybody's Changing - The 2nd song I discovered on the album, I thought was fantastic too. <br /> <br />Your Eyes Open - This is one of my favorite. The chorus with the vocals makes it soo... I don't know how to tell it but it's very special. <br /> <br />She Has No Time - I liked less this one, more slow-paced, not enough melodical on my opinion. <br /> <br />Can't Stop Now - A good rythmful and puts in relief the goodness of Richard's battery. <br /> <br />Sunshine - MY BIG FAVORITE so far, you absolutely have to listen to this! I find it excellent.  Oh oo-ooh, can anybody find their home ?  <br /> <br />Untitled 1 - This is the 2nd I like the less, too slow-paced again. <br /> <br />Bedshaped - A good final for this excellent album. The music always comes back to me in my head... Very good again. <br /> <br />In resumate, the album is worth buying it, trust me, you won't regret it !
B000ETQRCM|3.0|Well, <br />I havent bought the Cd, but i heard it in a music store from bigining to end. I liked it, after so many years i actually like the darn album. They are all maturing adults and the whole psychosocial proceses really influences the music quality in any human beings artistic expressin. Its not the best rock album of the year or the best PJ album, its just a really solid piece of artistic expressin from a group of middle aged men doing what they most enjoy, at least thats what i percive from their music............. <br />Good Album.................
0316172324|3.0|A series of interesting anecdotes create an enjoyable, effort-free and disposable read. Gladwell shares other people's hard work and hard-won insights, but by the time it gets to us it's conversation-piece material.  <br /> <br />The stories themselves are interesting and well-told. The case of the ghastly series of errors of police officers and a man standing on his stoop was expecially compelling.
B0002DB0FO|5.0|I can not believe that CW cancelled this great family show. I wish they would hurry up and release all the other DVD's so we can at least watch these episodes over and over.
B000ETQRCM|2.0|I'm very impresed for some reviews I read. The last album of Pearl Jam, Pearl Jam it's better than Stadium Arcadium of Red Hot Chili Peppers !!! <br />These two albums are very diferent. Two diferent music styles. But if we compared the music quality of these two albums. The Red Hot chili Album it's very much complex & very much varied than Pearl Jam last album. <br />This Pearl Jam grunge is very dirty ... I understand that this type of music is recorded in this type of sound. But come on !!! Nirvana album In Utero it's dirty but it's one hundred times much complex and cool than this Pearl Jam album. <br />I give two stars ... because respect to this band carreer & because this album have a few cool songs, but is an overvalued album. <br /> <br />
0553275976|5.0|When entering the competitive, cut-throat professional world, where stories abound of the dorm-mate who just landed the six figure job at Goldman Sachs, \\"The Bonfire of the Vanities\\" just may help you maintain the precious altruism that you grew up with. <br /> <br />This book is honest.  It's a story of how people become when they allow their ego to be defined by their over-compensation, and it's not pretty.  'Bonfire' is witty and human.  Mr. Wolfe does a fantastic job of developing his characters into people you'll care about, and builds their stories until you'll just cringe over the situations they put themselves into.  In the end you'll thank God you're not them.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I tried to walk away from this movie, but Serenity wouldn't let me.<br /><br />My wife rented Serenity after watching it at a science fiction convention, but the DVD skipped at a critical part.  She was so frustrated that she got up and left.  So she finally rented Serenity from Netflix and, on Mother's Day, brought it over to watch with my parents.  I had no intention of watching the movie.<br /><br />I was about to go upstairs and do something else.  But I forgot whatever it was I planned to do. I stood on the stairs, looking over my shoulder as the credits rolled.  And I stood there for five minutes, transfixed. A few minutes later, I sat down and watched the whole film.<br /><br />Serenity's that good.<br /><br />I could talk about the universe, or the characters, but what makes Serenity so fantastic is good old movie craftsmanship.  The cinematography is amazing, the CGI work appropriate, the acting on target, and the writing intentionally different, different enough to let us know that Joss Whedon is winking as he tells his story, the story he never got to finish on network television.  And that's ironic, because I am not a Firefly fan.<br /><br />I liked the concept: cowboys in space.  The Chinese slang, the idea that planets are new frontiers, good guys that look like bad guys and vice versa...it was all there.  It was like a retelling of Han Solo's life, without any reference to the Force.<br /><br />But the show?  Didn't do it for me.  I'm not a fan of Joss Whedon's dialogue.  His characters sometimes adopt a Tarantino-esque patter that's too perfect, such that I feel like I'm watching puppets on the screen instead of real characters.<br /><br />There's no trace of that problem in Serenity.  In the first five minutes, Whedon changes realities not once but twice, keeping you guessing about when the film's narrative will abruptly shift direction for a third time.  And once you're engrossed, Serenity never lets go.<br /><br />The cast is richly used, no small feat when there's so many: Zoe (Gina Torres) and her pilot-husband Wash (Alan Tudyk), Jayne the thug (Adam Baldwin), cute-as-a-button Kaylee (Jewel Statie), and two new stragglers: the handsome Simon Tam (Sean Maher) and her sister River (Summer Glau).<br /><br />River is the primary focus of the film.  She is an escaped test subject and a super weapon in her own right, but it's the knowledge locked in her head that is so dangerous to the oppressive Alliance.  Thus, we have the coolest villain in awhile--so cool he could be straight from Equilibrium, and that's saying something--The Operative (Chiwetel Ejiofor).  The Operative believes in old style honor and the value of a dream.  And because The Operative believes, he is the most dangerous kind of enemy.  He commits some atrocious crimes and tears up the universe looking for River. And in doing so, he causes a desperate captain (Nathan Fillion as Mal) to return to his warrior roots with a vengeance.<br /><br />Important characters die.  Desperate plots are hatched.  Characters faced with by-the-book dilemmas react to them in uncharacteristic ways, surprising the audience and themselves with the outcome.  And yet we still get space battles, fisticuffs, swordfights, romance, and plenty of humor.<br /><br />Serenity is Whedon's masterpiece, but make no mistake: it's because the director knows his medium and knows it well.  It's in this tightly produced film, rather than the series, that the cast and Whedon finally gel to make the best damn science fiction film in recent years.ichly used, no small feat when there's so many: Zoe (Gina Torres) and her pilot-husband Wash (Alan Tudyk), Jayne the thug (Adam Baldwin), cute-as-a-button Kaylee (Jewel Statie), and two new stragglers: the handsome Simon Tam (Sean Maher) and her sister River (Summer Glau).  <br /> <br />River is the primary focus of the film.

0142000663|5.0|'The Grapes of Wrath' is off the charts.  I'm not qualified to review this book, but I'd like to make one observation.  This masterpiece is the only book I've ever read that builds and builds until the very, very last word.  Three words before the end I had no idea of the unutterable tenderness that followed.  I will always remember how I felt at the moment I finished reading that last word.  It was \\"Huh?  No.  Oh my God.  That's it?  Of course it is.  I need a drink.\\"

B000EULJLU|5.0|Been a tool fan since 93...Lateralus was a great album, but as many tool fans have said, it just wasnt as good as previous tool releases, especially Aenima. Forutnately, Tool is back on track. This album is stunning, absolute brilliance. The sound is lush, the songs are infinitely intricate, and while they take much time to appreciate, reward greatly. This has been in my CD player since may 2...recommended to anyone with a soul...
B000EOTAM6|3.0|It has been a few years since I have seen the original animated series, which, if I remember correctly was almost Orwellian, a story of a future gone awry (think Terry Gilliam's Twelve Monkeys and Brazil)and a place where, at times, the boundaries could be non-existant between good and evil.   For the film, the moral ambiguity of Aeon's world has been watered down.  It has been replaced by an almost \\"Minority Report\\"-type plot, but much less intelligent.  The fighting many times does nothing but serve to show-off Charlize Theron when the plot should have been driving the action.   I though Charlize did well given the material.  But many of the supporting actors were under-utilized and underdeveloped. I also thought that Marton Csokas' character, Trevor Goodchild, was actually more dimensional in the original series. Here he is just an accessory for the lead actress.   I am disappointed, what could have been a slick little sci-fi thriller or neat little Orwellian film more in line with original series falls significantly short of both.   However, this is still a very watchable film and visually stunning.  Just don't expect too much from the plot.
B000EWBKM6|3.0|When I met my wife in 1998, I'd pretty much stopped watching TV due to a lack of ANYTHING I would devote my time to.  She turned me on to WILL & GRACE and I was immediately hooked on it's wacky dialogue and humor.  The classic episode of the leaking push-up bra remains one of the all-time great homages to I LOVE LUCY I've ever seen.    Like FRIENDS, though, the last few seasons relied more on guest star appearances as the overall writing became stale, uneven and unoriginal    Last night on NBC, it came to an end.  The series finale focussed on the probable outcome of Will and Grace's friendship through the years as they each pursued seperate lives with their significant others and their own children.  Their stories were touching and bittersweet, especially the sequence when their children meet in college and end up marrying each other.    Unfortunately, the episode as a whole was ruined by the one element that used to play a big part in the show's comedy; namely Jack and Karen.  The comedy that was written for their characters was not only stupid, but unnecessary to the bittersweet (there's that word again) point the episode was trying to make.     I mean, come on!  Karen hooking up with motorcycle-dyke Rosario?  Beverly Leslie getting caught and killed in a gust of wind off the balcony?  Is that really how the finale wanted to be remembered?  I personally would have kept Jack and Karen off the episode until their \\"Unforgettable\\" duet together.    Well, it's over now; and I no longer have any reason what-so-ever to watch any broadcast television, because frankly, it's ALL garbage!  Now I can sit back, relive the first two seasons of WILL & GRACE that I have on DVD, and remember when the show really kicked [...].
B000ETQRCM|5.0|Wow. <br /> <br />What can I say? This might be the greatest album I've ever heard. I even like it better than Zoso by Zeppelin or Who's Next? by the Who. <br /> <br />My favorite song off it is Come Back followed by Severed Hand. The whole thing is just incredible. <br /> <br />If you don't like it at first, keep listening & I guarantee you'll love it.

B000BM6AVA|5.0|This is System of a Down. They don't like Bush and the U.S. government, and they aren't afraid to yell and make loud music showing their hate. Hypnotize is the second part of their two-part series (I consider Mezmerize/Hypnotize two parts of the same album), and it's just as good as the first, if a bit heavier and less radio-friendly. From the aptly-named \\"Attack!\\", all the way to the full-length \\"Soldier Side,\\" this album has few faults. Taken as a separate album (same goes for Mezmerize), it seems kind of unfinished. However, with Mezmerize's songs telling their own stories, Hypnotize has a general underlying story. Overall, the album is really heavy, and if you liked Toxicity, you'll definitely like Hypnotize.
B000002LHX|3.0|I bought the Batman Soundtrack for one track: Scandalous. <br /> <br />It's my 2nd favorite Prince song. (If I Was Your Girlfriend is 1st) It's so sexy and brooding. I just love the music; and the lyrics sound like they were written for a woman to sing, which makes it even more seductive. <br /> <br />Of course, even when you buy an album for one song, there's almost always other songs you end up liking as well. Batdance is good even though it's a cut and paste of other song clips and dialogue. Lemon Crush, Partyman, and Vicki Waiting are also cool. Arms of Orion is nice even if a little sappy. The rest are listenable but don't stick with you. <br /> <br />No one will confuse the Batman music here with Purple Rain's, but it's a nice pick up for earnest Prince fans, or people who just want Batdance and Scandalous, which were left off Prince's The Hits/B-sides greatest hits collection. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005Q45W|3.0|Obviously, Leonard Cohen is not primarily a musician, but since this is a recording, the music counts, and there's no getting around that. Many of the lyrics here are among the best Cohen has ever composed (I'm especially thinking of \\"Alexandra Leaving\\", \\"Love Itself\\", and \\"Boogie Street\\"). Sharon Robinson is a very good singer, and helps Cohen's own failing voice (never much to begin with) enormously. Robinson's arrangements are not bad, either, but they need to be played by musicians, not realized by robots (MIDI sequencers).     This is not Cohen's first album of robot music--\\"I'm Your Man\\" and \\"The Future\\" also suffered from a dearth of actual musicians, but it is his most consistently robotic, and I'm forced to deduct two stars for that. Sorry, Leonard.     (If you want to hear what top-notch musicians can do for Cohen, listen to the brilliant \\"Recent Songs\\".)
B000002BFZ|5.0|Pearl Jam will go down as one of the greatest rock bands ever in history, especially with this year's comeback.  With all the lousy music that is out today, you can just pop this cd in, just like any Pearl Jam record, and you can remember just how great music used to be. Too bad instead of real music like Pearl Jam, people are listening to junk like Sean Paul and Hillary Duff now (I have no idea why). <br /> <br />This is probably my favorite Pearl Jam record...Hail Hail, In My Tree, and Off He Goes are my favorite, but each song on here is tremendous.  A must have for anyone who appreciates musical talent.
B000EWBKM6|4.0|The finale was a great ending to a good series.  Yes, the last few seasons were uneven in writing, but everything was tied up in this ending.  It was so sad to think that 2 best friends and roommates for 25 years would go 16 years without seeing or speaking to each other.  While this happens in real life it doesm't have to be the case.  Will and Grace could have lived their new separate lives while remaining in touch, at least occasionally.  If this had happened though, their kids would know each other and the serendipitous meeting of the son and daughter at college would not have been possible.  After the show ended, I called a good friend I had not spoken to in a while, made me want to keep those old friendships active, despite distance and different lives!

B000ERU6QC|5.0|Josh Homme is a rare talent in Rock music today. Aside from his Queens of the Stone Age he's involved in numerous projects of which he is essentially the leader. Josh is almost a music scene upon himself. On the more obscure side there is the Desert Sessions on the more successful side we've got the Eagles of Death Metal. Any fan of Homme and the first Eagles project can be extremely satisfied with its continuation.    Although the Eagles are a side project the quality of the material here doesn't fall below the standards he sets for Queens of the Stone Age. The Eagles seem more or less an outlet for his more compact songs and an opportunity to play with other musicians. We also find Homme more at easy to experiment with styles. Aside from the Stoner Rock he's most famous for we find blues and country flavors in the mix, making this a pleasantly diverse outing for Josh.    As with Queens of the Stone Age the music sounds like a mean Mescal drunk, you at once feel horny and get the sensation the devil is chasing you. The album is filled with sweaty sex and dark tales. Death by Sexy does it title justice.  You get an urge that could kill and doesn't put you in the mood to be careful. It's a rock hard orgasm.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|This album is awsome from start to finish! This is the Pearl jam I like! No experiments, just rock and roll as it should be.
B000EMGJM2|3.0|As mentioned by a few other reviewers, I was left wondering, \\"Huh?\\" and scratching my head on this one.  I absolutely loved Hunt's debut, but this sophomore album really didn't do it for me as much.  Sadly, there's only one track on the entire CD that I really enjoy (#10).  Mind you, my somewhat negative review for this CD by no means depreciates Hunt as the excellent artist that he is in any way at all.  I can understand trying something a tad bit different and changing up things a little for his sophomore album, but honestly, I think he went a little TOO far out in left field.  Either way, I won't give up on him just yet.  Instead I'll allow album #3 to make or break my \\"fanship\\" when/if it drops.
B000006UNG|5.0|This was the peak of the bands creativity. The music and lyrics create a perfect unit. The lyrics are often hard to understand and cryptic but they are so much a part of the music itself that you end up not minding much. When you finally figure the meaning of the words out, there is no surprise, because somehow you get the message even if you understand only 20% of the words. That, in my definition, is how a perfect song should be. The album somewhat foreshadows the even more melancholy and experimental direction that the group took after \\"The Colour of Spring\\". Unfortunately that led them too far from the mainstream, and eventually, music altogether. But this album is the peak effort of one of the most talented bands of the 80's.
B000E1ZBGS|2.0|This version has beautiful scenery, costumes, actors and has great film quality! The acting is marvelous. Mr. Dacy does such a wonderful job being tormented inside and portraying that torment without a word, only showing it in his guarded expressions. Lizzie and Jane are both beautiful and great actresses. Mr. Bingly is a bit overly enthusiastic and air headed, but pleasing. It had the potential to be a great version of Pride and Prejudice.....but it wasn't!<br /><br />  I was confused most of the time and at the end felt like I was rushed through a beautiful love story. I have been a fan of Pride and Prejudice ever since watching the 1996 version starring Colin Firth and have since watched it so many times I have it memorized! Perhaps that is the problem. The 1996 version was a wonderful story. I always knew what each character was feeling and what was going on. There were no gaps in the story and I fell in love with it. I was excited to learn there was an updated version being released this year because I hoped for a better film quality than the 1996 one. It at least had that much going for it. It was a beautiful picture but with a hurried story. They should have lengthened the film so the viewer knew all the characters and details of the story. Instead the movie felt rushed, like a summary to the real thing. A good movie, perhaps if you haven't watched the 1996 version already, but I strongly suggest you only rent this one and then buy the other =-).
0066620996|4.0|Several reviewers have outlined the essential features of this book and there is no need to repeat that here. The great strength of the book is an apparent discipline to develop objective data and draw generalized conclusions. However, I wonder if the underlying criteria are flawed for identifying great companies. The basic idea is to identify companies that were generally average for a sustained (15 year period) and become well above average (3 x industry standard in stock price) for a sustained period (again, 15 years). However, as the book points out, those in the company did not notice the shift. In many cases, it seems to correlate with having been noticed by the press - creating a buzz that boosts stock values without any fundamental change in business productivity. While it would be hard to sustain this for 15 years if a company was a flash in the pan, it is quite imaginable that a recently discovered, well run company could sustain this without having any particularly distinguishing characteristics relative to other well run companies except for recently appearing on the popular press radar screen.  <br />Aside from this criticism and no effort to identify poor or average companies with the same characteristics as the great companies, the methodology seems very sound and the work conscientious.  <br />The book is an excellent read and much more substantial than the commonly touted endless and commonly superficial lists of things to do and not to do to succeed in business. I highly recommend it.
0375423877|5.0|This book is the first book I have read with the setting being in Africa.  I feel as though I am peering into the beauty of a new culture.  I love the honesty of the characters to the reader and how real they feel to me.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Now, it is quite apparent that Green Day seems to have become public enemy no. 1 to many, mainly fans of punk music. For one, I think it should be clear to everybody that Green Day is NOT punk. Really, Green Day have NEVER been punk, so I don't understand why people who review this product must constantly chant this repetitive mantra of \\"Green Day is not punk, listen to sex pistols, etc...\\". If you want punk music, do not listen to this, or any Green Day album for that matter. If you want complex, advanced guitar riffs and solos, DO NOT get this album. The one element of punk music that Green Day does have is their love for three chord anthems. If you are a very patriotic person who loves America and possibly even Bush, once again, DO NOT get this album, as you will likely be offended by its less-than-impressive political commentary (there isn't that much, really).  <br /> <br />So then, who should get this album? Well, it is an alternative rock album, or pop-punk as this genre is often called. All of these songs are catchy in some way or another, and in my opinion have some pretty good lyrics. The album is not as politically charged as people seem to believe. It's called a concept album, and i'm not entirely sure what that \\"concept\\" is, but I know one thing, and that is ALL of these songs are really good. They all possess some sort of hook that sort of draws you in, and in my opinion that is good music. Of course, it is my opinion, and what people need to realise is that all people have different tastes. Stating something like \\"Green day sucks, that's a fact\\" is sort of pointless, as opinions differ from person to person.  <br /> <br />IN MY OPINION, this is an excellent CD. It is good from beginning to end, and that's why I'm giving it 5 stars. As I said before, and as is evidenced by the mob of mostly unintelligable (but occasionally insightful) negative reviews, not everyone will like this album. If you like pop-punk or are open-minded about music, than this record is a must. If you don't like the genre and don't like Green Day, then don't buy it. It's that simple.
1576463508|5.0|Jane Austen's books are fabulous. Her writing is superb and captivates the reader. Pride and Prejudice is an excellent book. It tells a story of five young girls to be married and has a very engaging plot. Young girls will not be disappointed with Jane Austen's novels. All her works are very inspiring.<br /><br />Cynthia Marie Rizzo author of \\"Angela and the Princess\\" and \\"Julie and the Unicorn\\"
B000002AGE|5.0|This great band pulled it all together on this, their finest recording. Brilliant compositions played with brio by five fabulous musicians who created a sound that's unlike anything before: it's Weather Report music, and there is no genre term that can confine it. If you haven't heard this recording, you have been on a desert island, and if I am ever marooned, I want, nay, need to have this recording with me. It should be considered a classic of 20th-century music.
1594200823|4.0|Finally a well written book that makes people think about our dependence on animals and our planet.  For a real eye-opener, I suggest buying or renting the documentary \\"Earthlings\\".  Narrated by Joaquin Phoenix, it has won several awards.  You will never look at food, or our treatment of animals, in the same way again.  Not for the faint of heart, but I wish every person on this planet were forced to watch it.
B0000262QW|5.0|The praise other reviewers have given this recording speak for me, but I must add that no one understands how to get the most out of the Fender Rhodes piano than Chick Corea. Hancock and Zawinul came close, but only Chick can coax this much beauty from this great musical instrument.
0440241588|4.0|This is a fun book that is fairly typically of John Grisham's style of writing in books like \\"The Firm\\".  You have an individual who finds himself in various predicaments and who constantly struggles to stay one step ahead of those who want to kill him.  Although much has been made about the Italian setting of the book, I didn't think it was a key element; the setting couldn've just as easily been anywhere. <br /> <br />The surprising thing about this novel is that the main character is not a very likeable guy.  Although most of Grisham's key characters are always less than perfect, this guy was pretty close to rock bottom as far as leading characters go.  Still, he wasn't such a louse that you root for him to be caught or killed. <br /> <br />The main tool the book uses is suspense.  There's always some new, often unexplained shadowy fiqure lurking.  The lead character always has to be thinking 3 steps ahead to escape.  All in all, Grisham just has the gift of making it all flow very quickly and remain interesting. <br /> <br />While this book will never be regarded as one of his best, it's still pretty good.  I will warn you that the ending is unsatisfying and leaves you wondering if he was planning a sequel.  If you don't have another book you've really been itching to read, I'd recommend this one.  It's fun.
038572179X|2.0|When it was released, Atonement, by Ian McEwan, was widely praised by critics as one of McEwan's greatest works, an epic tale of war, conflict, and betrayal. Those who read such reviews undoubtedly rushed to the book store to buy themselves a copy and to eventually find themselves terribly, terribly mislead. Atonement is not a brilliant book. Atonement is not even a good book, or a well written book. Atonement is a book in which author McEwan is remarkably able to simultaneously capture a dense and mundane narrative voice as well as an unbelievable soap-opera style plot and does so at great length. The combination results in a tiresome three hundred page story about the life an over-privileged attention haunt as she whines her way through her youth, destroying the lives of everyone who crosses her path. While book reviews raved about how difficult it was to put this book down, this reader found it exceedingly easy. The hard part seemed to muster up the courage to pick it up again and launch into another long and wordy jaunt about another surprise turn in a dead end plot.  <br />     Atonement is the story of Briony, a rich and self-centered teenage girl with an extremely active imagination living in the suburbs of pre-war Britain. The story begins as Briony plans to put on a play of her own writing, a melodrama named The Trials of Arabella. Her cousins arrive, and everything seems set for her production; they are to act in the play, and she will direct it, as well as star in the leading role. Her own drama begins, however, as she intercepts a suggestive letter from the charlady's son Robbie to her older sister Cecilia. She is scared and confused by this, and when her cousin Lola is raped by an unknown assailant, she convinces everyone that it was Robbie who did it, eventually sending him to jail for nothing except the benefit of her own imagination. She does not even appear to feel any remorse over the issue.  <br />     The book continues as it follows Robbie,now free from jail and battling for his country, as he journeys home to meet Cecilia. McEwan describes this, as well as Robbie's terrible war experiences, with painstaking detail that makes one want to skip ahead until he actually makes it home. He does, eventually, and finds love again with Cecilia, from whom the war Briony's selfish antics have separated him for years.  <br />      Briony is a nurse now, who is also exposed to the harsh realities of war. Ian McEwan puts on her a mask of maturity, implying that exposure to this devastation has turned her into a new woman, but she remains the same old Briony. She sees that the love between Cecilia and Robbie has remained, and that she appears to have changed as well. The plot climbs upward, heading for a peak, a reconciliation, an apology or resolution... <br />But it never comes. Briony does not even truly atone for her wrongdoings, how she nearly single-handedly destroyed the lives of Robbie and her sister, rendering the title of the book a misnomer, and every plot twist and turn of the page pointless. The story limps to a disappointing close, and the reader is left with a sour taste in their mouth. <br />      Even as this story stumbles through a ridiculous plot, there seems to be hope. Even as McEwan blathers on in thick, wordy prose, there is something that keeps you turning the page; the hope that this spoiled and rich English girl will eventually come to her senses and apologize or change or realize what she has done, as the title of the book promises. That is why this reader was able to make it through. To see Briony come clean would be truly remarkable; a major growth in character and in plot. But that event never occurs, and there is no growth. Just Briony, a cruel and selfish girl who does not grow and does not change, wrapped in three hundred pages of fluff. If you are looking for true atonement, do not look here. You are only wasting your time. <br />
B00007KWHN|5.0|\\"The Yes Album\\" was a radical departure from the band's previous work and launched them as one of the best, if not the best, progressive rock groups. <br />There's not a bad cut on this album - not even the \\"bonus\\" extras. <br />The digital remastering was well done as the sound is excellent. <br />If I were to have only one Yes album, this would be it.
B0007Y4TVU|2.0|Where do I start?? I must say I am quite disappointed at the result of System's fourth full album. I expected so much more after \\"System Of A Down\\", \\"Toxicity\\" and \\"Steal This Album\\" were so unbelievably fantastic. Mezmerize is a break from the heaviness that System is so famous for. They tone it down a fair bit on this record, and I think it was a mistake. While I respect them for having the balls to mess with a new sound for Mezmerize, I think System should've stuck to what they do best: creating musical chaos on every single song. This album is full of melodies and ballads. Ugh. With two exceptions, that being \\"BYOB\\" and \\"Cigaro\\", this album is just boring.  <br /> <br />Kudos to System for daring to explore a different sound, but experimentation ain't their thing. They should stick to their guns and keep making ultra-heavy, intense music and stay away from slow, soppy ballads. Don't buy this album. Download BYOB and Cigaro and if you're desperate, maybe even Radio/Video. Other than that, thumbs down for me.
B0000648WZ|3.0|In \\"Starship Troopers \\"Paul Verhoeven demonstrates a school boy knowledge tactics and \\"combined arms warfare\\"! While showing the same rather unique understanding for all things military, that he showed for women in \\"Showgirls\\",     Still this movie provides some \\"dazzling special effects\\". About half way I began hoping the insects would win! They at least showed more logic than many of the cast players. I don't know why but Paul Verhoeven never seems to be able to make his likable characters. With the possible exception of \\"Dizzy\\"!    Troopers owes more to films Paul Verhoeven saw as a child than Robert Heinlein's novel. In many ways the first half of the movie resembles the great film \\"All Quiet On The Western Front\\". There is even a physical resemblance between the stars (Lew Ayres and Casper Van Dien). Unlike \\"All Quiet On The Western Front\\", Verhoeven's movie fails to make the \\"Antiwar Statement\\" he clearly wanted to make. The second half several scenes resemble \\"Beau Geste\\" and \\"The Charge of the Light Brigade\\" with none of the class or style. His \\"Anti-[...word deleted](elitist, right-wing militarist)\\" message actually is lost in the movies excesses. In fact in many ways the movie backfires.

1558908846|1.0|On its own, Judge Dredd is really a horrible movie. The acting, the effects, the plot (cyborg cannibals? evil twin? Statue of Liberty?) It's all terrible. <br /> <br />However, if you watch this movie expecting it to be bad, it suddenly becomes the Greatest. Movie. Ever. (Come on! Cyborg Cannibals! Evil twins! Statue of Liberty!) This is a great movie to watch with a group on friends doing a running commentary. (Sort of Mystery Science Theater 3000) How else can you enjoy such great lines as \\"I AM THE LAW!\\" and wondering how Diane Lane's career survived such a movie?
B00000064G|5.0|The thought of Nick Drake being so depressed that his life would end at the tender young age of 26 is itself, to me, a sobering and depressing fact about how hard life can be. While Nick Drake may not have been able to cope with life, it is also clear to me that his was a gentle and sensitive poet's soul. Listening to this - his most stark recording - you come directly in contact with Nick Drake's very soul, and this soul lives on. The record is thus haunting, and beautiful.<br /><br />I'm no religious fanatic, but I cannot help but think that the sheer depth of the music of Nick Drake, and of Pink Moon in particular, hints at a realm of the spiritual. There is simply something in this - Drake's quiet guitar strumming, his mournful singing, the overall simplicity of the arrangements - that is not unlike the moment of contemplation that one sometimes experiences while sitting in a holy place, be it a church, or a chapel, or even a small natural pond surrounded by nature, and which is thus transcendent.<br /><br />In fact, as Ian McDonald's sympathetic Mojo article \\"Exiled From Heaven\\" argues, \\"Nick Drake wasn't a literal disciple of Blake or Buddha. There are no direct Blake references in his lyrics, nor is he likely to have treated Buddhism as more than a confirmation of concepts he'd arrived at through his own experience. Nevertheless Blake's mystical vision and the tenets of Buddhism illuminate a great deal of his work. Drake's outlook seems to have boiled down to the linked recognitions that life is a predicament and that the world is ultimately an irreducible mystery to us. Why it exists, why we exist in it, why there is anything at all, we haven't the slightest idea. From this sense of predicament and mystery flows all his work and also his message to us. More than that, the same influences shaped the growth and decline of his life.\\" The article adds, about Drake's vocals, that it is \\"a low, close, sustained sound, rich in chest vibration yet entirely without glamorous vibrato. It's the sound of incantation: slow, deep, OM-like. His phrasing is riverine, flowing across metre and through bar-lines as though detached from normal time. It's as if he's seeking to impress upon us the sense of another way of being.\\"<br /><br />Looking at, and considering such elements of this music, it is obvious that there is more here than a quick consideration might recognize. It is perhaps these various elements which makes this music so rich, and which, for me at least, causes it to become ever more satisfying with each subsequent listen. I just know that I'll be listening to Nick Drake for the rest of my life. I can't say that with confidence about too many musicians.. It's the sound of incantation: slow, deep, OM-like.

B000003NA3|5.0|To the reviewer \\"Rose: Jazz Fan\\", thank you so much for reminding me that this set contains an incredible version of \\"Softly, As in a Morning Sunrise\\". McCoy Tyner is unbelievable on it , and the drummer (Elvin Jones? Roy Haynes? I don't remember)uses brushes during Tyner's part beofre switching to sticks when Coltrane comes in.  It's the most hard-driving swing I've ever heard. I used to listen to this set several times a week during the late '70's, when in college.  My vinyl copies are worn and scratchy sounding, which is why I haven't listened to it much in the past 25 or so years.  But just thinking about this music now makes the hair stand up on the back of my neck.  It's amazing stuff.

B000002I4W|4.0|If you're on the fence about Ornette Coleman, or think you just don't like \\"free jazz\\", or whatever, just try to put away preconceptions and listen to \\"Lonely Woman\\" with a relaxed mind and open ears.  While doing so, think of Johnny Hodges, perhaps.  Dawn, dusk and midnight are great times for this music.  It's not \\"free jazz\\", and you might be surprised how beautiful it is.
B00004RF9B|4.0|What could possibly be more iconic of 50s science fiction that Robbie the Robot? Throw in Anne Francis and there can no longer be any doubt: FORBIDDEN PLANET is THE icon. <br /> <br />Its not too bad a movie for its time. A ship from earth is dispatched to check in on a colony that has been silent for far too long. Upon arrival, the crew of the ship learn that there is only one survivor of the original party, a Dr. Morbius. To keep him company, he has his daughter and a robot he built. To occupy his time, he studies the vanished civilization that one lived on the planet and builds miraculous devices such as the robot. <br /> <br />Needless to say, the crew is a bit perturbed by Morbius's account of the deaths of the rest of his party. They were all violently killed by a strange beast who has not appeared in 20 years. The beast does re-appear, though, and starts to pick off members of the ship's crew. There is very limited time to figure out what is going on before all are dead. The secret lies within themselves. <br /> <br />As with most such productions of this age, the science is laughable. The story is fun, though, and Anne sure was pretty! <br />
0689865384|5.0|Tally Youngblood undersestimates her adversaries in this fantastic voyage.  A very good book for teens!  This book was full of surprises and really left you waiting for Pretties to come out.  Well written, clever ending.<br /><br />George O. Love<br />Author of \\"On the Scene\\"
B000EPR7NE|5.0|It took me about 2 seconds of thought whether I should buy this CD as I laid my eyes on it. All I can say is that the money I brought with me to get dinner was spent in a better way on music that literally fed the soul better than any food. <br /> <br />I'm a huge soundtrack lover and collector and movie scores are my favorite, especially grand movies that stay in my memory such as costume dramas and period pieces. Within 1 minute of having this music on half the hair on my body was standing pin straight. The choruses are out of this world, giving this a mythical, sacred sound that made me feel as if I was falling into the music itself. Hans Zimmer is a master of creating an environment with his music that envelops the listener and makes the movies on 100% more real than it can be. <br /> <br />The Da Vinci Code soundtrack sounds just the way you would imagine it to; rich, opulent, hypnotic mix of choruses that pick you up from ancient catacombs and shoot you straight up to heaven. Although I loved the score on the first listen, upon hearing it again a few times I felt like it sounded even better as I knew what to expect and learned to relish the glorious sounds and even though I don't read Latin the chapter titles from the back made more sense to me.  <br />This soundtrack was a mix of powerful orchestra music, some lovely violin solos, great chase music and wonderful choral tapestry of sounds. This music is not all heavy and ancient; there are some lovely romantic moments with opreatic arias (\\"poisoned chalice\\"), harphs, crying cellos and violas that transported me to a magical valley, with hurling winds and open spaces. <br /> <br />Overall it's a lovely soundtrack and a must have for anyone who enjoys original scores and can be listened to no matter what mood or time of the day because it's beauty stands true regardless of everything else.
0783228317|3.0|Despite their fans' best efforts, some books just aren't filmable. David Cronenberg's Classics Comics version of Naked Lunch came to mind while watching Fear and Loathing, since both books depend on language and rhetoric rather than plot or characterization for their effect. Gilliam's heavy dependence on Depp's character (Thompson? Duke? Gonzo?)'s voice over of significant chunks of the book merely shows that what made Thompson's work so fun to read was how he said it. Ralph Bakshi's idea of making an animated version based on Ralph Steadman's illustrations sounds like it would have captured the tone of the book much better than this movie.
B000002MY3|4.0|First, let me say I'm on the fence between 5 and 4 stars.  Know that whichever of those two I picked, I was very close to picking the other. <br /> <br />I grew up listening to nothing my dad's Billy Joel albums until my friend introduced me to Savage Garden, Backstreet Boys, and Z-104, the local pop station.  Therefore, Alanis's mega-hit album was both too recent to be something my parents would play for me and too old to be something my friends and I would talk about. <br /> <br />When I came across this album in the library a couple of weeks ago, I decided I would give it a shot.  Granted, I'd heard most of the songs on the radio over the years, but I figured I might as well see what the entire package is like.  So I checked it out, brought it home, popped it into the CD player, and gave it a listen. <br /> <br />Now that I've been listening to it for a couple weeks, I can see how it became such a big success.  First of all, Alanis picked a great opening track.  Wild enough to show the fierceness and intensity of emotion that she apparently was trying to display and instill in our minds as we listened, yet catchy enough to not scare most people away.  It's the hardest track on the disc, and primes us for some rebellious, sassy emotional outbursts throughout. <br /> <br />The sort of feminine anger and expression that you feel from the first track is amplified perfectly by her one-of-a-kind voice from beginning to end, and really sticks with you on the first listen.  But by the second, third, fourth listen, you get used to it.  And then you can focus on Alanis's true success, the real reason that this album went however many times platinum: the high-quality, catchy pop-rock. <br /> <br />The hooks Alanis puts together competes with the best of them, matching even some of The Beatles and Huey Lewis and The News during their primes.  Some of the better cuts include not only classics like \\"Ironic\\" and \\"You Oughta Know\\" but lesser played jewels like \\"Head Over Feet.\\"The tunes stick with you and sound even better the sixth time through that they did the first time through. <br /> <br />Overall, my only complaints are that there are a few weak spots.  During some of the slower sections, Alanis's voice which usually seems \\"distinctive\\" and \\"unique\\" becomes \\"off-key\\" and \\"annoying.\\" <br /> <br />Right now, what's really drawing me to this album is the grade-A music and usually-great vocal performances by Alanis.  Maybe after a few more listens, the lyrics will start catching my attention.  Either way, I know I'm in for something good, because Alanis has given us somewhat of a masterpiece. <br /> <br />BOTTOM LINE: <br />The raw, rugged, personal emotionality of the songs will fascinate you the first listen through, but the fantastic musical hooks will keep you coming back for more.
B000EGDC14|4.0|\\"Supernature\\" is a continuation of the electro-dance sound of \\"Black Cherry\\" with a few touches of \\"Felt Mountain\\". One of my favorite songs is \\"Ooh La La\\" in which Goldfrapp channels some serious T. Rex mojo. Other glam highlights include \\"Lovely 2 C U\\", \\"Ride A White Horse\\", \\"Slide In\\" and \\"Number 1\\". Fans of \\"Felt Mountain\\" will love \\"Let It Take You\\" and \\"Time Out From The World\\". The deluxe version has a DVD that's tons of fun. In addition to the videos and photos is a 5.1 version of the album (for only a dollar more than the regular edition!) On the video of \\"Ooh La La\\", I'd be truly surprised if Alison and Will hadn't studied performances by artists such as T. Rex, David Bowie and Roxy Music. The outfits and poses are a terrific homage to these '70's rockers from which Goldfrapp was clearly inspired by this time around. So get your platform shoes and bell bottoms out and Rock On!
B000FIMG68|3.0|Lost's second season was not BAD. It simply wasn't up to par with the first. The story was too convolted, and the new characters were not nearly as effective as the originals.  <br /> <br />J.J Abrams left to work on a film career, and it was evident.  <br />The constant killing of characters for shock value resulted in a weaker cast, and the ratings are now showing it.  <br /> <br />This DVD will be worth purchasing for only the most hard-core of fans... season 1 is a nessecity. Hopefully, the show gets back on track for it's third season, because I know they have the potential... although, once again, J.J won't be around.
B000021Y77|4.0|Good movie.  Well-paced.  Great music.  But try watching it as a cross between Groundhog's Day and X-Men.  Seriously.  Consider Lola as a super hero- time manipulation, sonic powers (a la Banshee), healing powers. <br /> <br />Lola is a super hero.
B000ETQRCM|3.0|I did not expect much from Pearl Jam's lastest adventure and I was quite right with my prediction.  Now, does the self-titled Pearl Jam have some value? Yes, most notably with the hit single `Life Wasted' and the seven minute power-ballad `Inside Job,' both pretty good.  In fact, there are at least three other tracks I'd go out of my way to hear:  The back-to-back combo of  `Big Wave' and `Gone' both show shimmers of Pearl Jam's former glory, and `Severed Hand,' my favorite song, reminds me very much of the timeless material off Vs. (the greatest of the Pearl Jam masterpieces).  But here's the problem:  Ah, of course the filler (`Marker in the Sand, Unemployable, Army Reserve' all serve no purpose) just HAD to devastate the whole experience for me.  I am accustomed to hearing filler on Pearl Jam's most recent releases, and this listen presented some hefty flashbacks of those numerous shameful tracks off No Code and Riot Act.  The variable here, however, is the big time track `World Wide Suicide.'  It's okay; not nearly as great as everyone's making it out to be--already placed on the greatest PJ-songs ever list.  Sorry, but this can't compare with the timeless classics `Jeremy' and `Dissident' in any way, shape, or form.  Overall, I'd say it's worth a listen to, but don't get too excited (we don't want another American Idiot on our hands).
B0006SSOHC|2.0|With the opening scene a mix of fear and panic, as two men realize they're both chained to pipes, with a dead man in the middle of a puplic sewer bathroom, it isnt long before... Before um...  <br /> <br />I watched this movie in the theatre, and again when it came out on DVD, i have no idea why i saw it again. For starters, why did they call it \\"saw\\" ? Did they think just because of a vague reference, they could get away with it? Well... According to a few reviews, apparently they did. But they didn't get by me.  <br /> <br />The movie revolves around a serial killer who throws puzzles at his victims in which case with a lot of luck, will power, and the will to live, they could get through. The premise is, he doesn't kill people, he just forces them to kill themselves... It isn't all that. Good premise, bad writing of it. <br /> <br />First of all, I don't take much issue with the name so much, as I take issue with the sheer stupidity of the writer who came up with this thing. I'll give them one star for originality, and one star for good cosmetic effects, the rest just isn't there.  <br /> <br />For starters, from the way the storyline [if you can call it that] is given, you can tell an amateur wrote the script and therefore, they should have made the story a little better, or wrote it a little more believable.  <br />For instance, the hack saws the two men get [maybe that's why they called it saw]. They have six hours to live, and they give up sawing through the chains after ten seconds... Record time for stupidity. Ok, ill give the one who broke his a break, but the other one who remained calm, could have gotten out if he sawed instead of jabbered. This was a huge turn off for me, and thus, the rest was just a bit of mindless plot that seemed to just be added at the last minute. Almost as if they were making it up as they went along.  <br /> <br />Let's be realistic, if any intelligent human being were in that situation, sure, we'd be afraid, but with so much time and a hack saw [let alone a doctor who must have learned patience during his 10 years in school]... we wouldn't be so stupid as the two men were. Since most of the story revolves around them, I don't give any sympathy to the characters.  <br /> <br />As for the movie itself, it had a few really cool scenes of people in hopeless situations, and a few jaw dropping views of solid gore, but once you got used to it... it wasn't anything special.  <br /> <br />If more thought went into this movie, and maybe they actually tried to make the name make sense, it might have been a good movie. But inevitably, since we're watching two morons talk to each other for 2/3s of the film...  <br />it is rather boring. <br />
B000EMGAOY|4.0|There is a lot of good music on this cd. The problem is that there is a lot of music. It is not better than Californication or By the Way.  There are several very good songs and some really great songs.  If they left the merely good off it would be one terrific cd.  As a hard core RHCP fan, I am glad to have all this music.  However, I will probably end up removing some of it from my ipod making my own version of what is probably their 3rd best album.
B000065U1N|5.0|In 1993 Somalia became controlled by a war lord who decided to starve the nation [AKA genocide]. The clinton administration sent in Marines to secure convoys of food for the strarving locals, then one day they were fired upon. With the withdrawal of marines, Clinton sent in Rangers, Deltas, and SEALs. This movie is about what happened on a day where a mission was supposed to be reautine, lasting lest than an hour or so. Instead it lasted a day... or so.  <br /> <br />The best quality of this movie, is that it plays at its non-fiction role in history, and it plays it well. So well, I don't know why many People ive asked, have not seen this film, and some, even more disturbingly, don't remeber what happened.  <br />With stunning visuals, heroic acting that will leave you speachless [as Josh hartnet, and even edwin mcgregor give a superb performance. Orlando bloom even did a good job, since he quit while he was ahead]. With such actors, under the strict guidence of their director and screen writer, gave us one of the more memorable movies of our day. Here in the year 2006, modern urban combat movies havnt made it to the drawing boards, though they should, since they remind us just how much our boys do for us every day... even if it's 3000 miles away.  <br />With unflinching realism, yes I know of a few bloopers here and there, but the storyline is so accurate, I almost cried at the heroism protrayed by the actors, knowing in the back of my mind, someone actually did this. This movie portrays heroism itself. no one asks to be a hero, it's just what you do when you're scared to death.  <br />Bravery is emphasized in this film, much like honor, courage, valor, and the power of the American special forces of the periode [God help our enemies today post 9/11]. From two Snipers going down on a basic suicide mission [and being awarded the medal of honor a few days later], to the shere reality that war is not a game at all, as 19 soldier's are left dead at the end of the day,and many more wounded.  <br /> <br />Great storyline, thrown with great actors, with a bunch of realistic shots of Morroco, plus realistic sounds and explosions, add in some military training for the actors, and you get Black Hakw down. The best portrayal of urban modern combat movie to date. This one surelly deserves a place on every patriot's home DVD's collection shelf.  <br /> <br /> <br />Hoo-ah! <br />
B000AP04OM|5.0|Certain scenes from this movie stick in one's mind forever. Who could forget the scene where the father says, \\"You delivered your message. Now get out of here!\\" to the guy (the future boyfriend of his daughter) who has just given the Heil [...] salute? Or the scene where the father tears down the German [...] flag soon after the Anschluss? The music is always lively and upbeat, especially for such a sad and tragic time in history.
B000AMJG4Y|2.0|I remember back in the day when i first played FFvii. It was the kicker that kinda set off all the RPGs. The story was excellent, the graphics disgusting but who cared when the storyline was beautiful and the dialogue was better than average. The characters were memorable for their individual quirks and reactions to situations and such and who can forget the stories they brought along with them? it was the GAME!  <br />and then they made a movie...  <br /> <br />Since Sephiroth's dead, they can't rightly put him back in, but since it seems that was the whole central point of the movie [a bit lame], they did it anyway. The whole movie centers around Cloud trying to get over his feelings of worthlessness [sound familiar?]. We see Tiffa a few times, but we see Rufus more than any of the other characters [except Cloud since he's the star]. Red and Cid get like three lines, if that[and let's face it, they are Awesome!], and so does Yuffie, or Cait Sith. It's just disappointing how little the team work was shown, however there is ONE really neat scene where they all help in clobbering a monster. Other than that, it's just Cloud doing his thing.  <br />There arent that many fight scenes and when there are... well, here in the matrix and dragon ball z spoiled world, let's just say they're kinda old school, you know what i'm talking about... TOO SHORT!  <br />The dialogue in Jap is ok, it sounds just like any other regular movie [nothing special], but the dubbed English version... well... it sounds the same but... the words are really, really cheesy. Sure i understand all the girly bad guys [however there is ne bad guy who actually looks like a guy], want to find Mother for what ever reason, but come on, we don't need to here the constant \\"Ahh... OOf, RAH!\\" True that sometimes there needed to show how much struggle is going on, but not when there are more of them than understandable words, and the words that are there aren't really worth listening to.  <br /> <br />The Graphics are breath taking, and the only reason why i added a star. They are so good i thought i was watching a real life movie in some places. but...  <br /> <br />the whole reason why FF vii was such a success was because it was so different form other RPGs and because of it's great story and characters. The movie kinda just follows cloud and forgets about everyone else, so much so that when they all do come out... it really looks like they just slapped it on at the last minute. The whole central plot is a bit vague and lame too, no more monster's to take out, no more world to save, no one's looking for trouble, life seems normal... perhaps in the FF vii world, it should stay so unless by some strange miracle the writers can think of an original way to bring sephiroth back or... perhaps think about making a better bad guy who keeps the long hair and katana sword...  <br /> <br />In recent months, movies based off of video games are hitting the movie theatres and shelves slowly but surely. With halo possible coming in 2007 as a movie, and silent hill still in theatre's, it's little wonder why most of them are disappointing. Video games that are good are like books, really, really long. Until producer's get over the mortal terror, and start making epic films, there will be a few satisfied faces, and a lot of other disappointed ppl behind, knowing full well it could have been alot better.  <br /> <br />rent this movie before you spend money on it. if you're a die hard ff vii fan, watch it for old times sake. If you've played the game and fell in love with it because of the story and characters... the movie is a sorry excuse for a sequel, as most are.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />The bonus feature's are really good, they provide alot of hope in their previews of upcoming, and previous games and such, as well as interviews with the creator, and a few more extra goodies. <br />
B00005V9HH|5.0|For all those who were able to predict the end of the film while watching it I'm glad you're smarter than the rest of us.  The first time I saw The Usual Suspects I walked in at the end and had the surprise ruined before I ever got a chance to see the film. <br />That did not reduce my love for this movie at all.  The beauty comes from the subtle way Verbal manipulates his way through tough situations.  Most of the movie's finer touches, like the way Verbal smokes his cigarette in the American style while in the police station and European style when he is alone do not become obvious until you know the truth. <br />Rarely have I come across a film that immerses you in another world so completely I get the same feeling from this film that I do from Casablanca. <br />
B00005JOYA|3.0|As a little girl expieriences life like dreams, and periodically sleep walks and screams \\"Silent hill!\\" one might get either a small chill, or a slight giggle at the opening sequence... the rest is, well...  <br /> <br />Silent hill is an exelent game series, full of chilling and unrelenting fearful sights, sounds, and expieriences. The one thing most people dont realize however, is that Silent hill plays off of the fact that there will always be more quiestions than answers. Don't watch this movie and expect to get the plot the first time around. In fact, dont ever intend to watch and understand, it just sinmple wasnt meant to be, which is why there are 4 games to date [and with the movie, im sure its creator's are thinking up of another one].  <br /> <br /> <br />in contrast to the many \\"Horror\\" genre films out there, this movie is finally unique [much like the game]. It's not a slasher, suspense, or mindless scary movie, it's all three. Forget the Ring, Amittiville horror, the grudge, white noise, and any other movies that were supposed to be scary these past two or three years, this one is in a league all of its own... alone.  <br /> <br />The plot, as you can deciefer in the first few seconds of watching the trailor, is about the main character [a woman who seems incredabily determind to do things her way] frantically searching for her daughter in a place called... yes you guessed it, Silent Hill. Other than that, the plot doesnt really change, sure there are a few hints and clues and climaxs telling you just what the heck's going on, but the underlying \\"why\\" of Silent Hill will illude you throughout and even into the ending credits. All in all, original for the way it is shown, and the sights and sounds of it all. Even the music can get creepy at times, now if only they did that more...  <br /> <br /> <br />This is the best adaptation ive ever seen to a video game. Even the feel and sounds make you remember the game as you watch, and while a movie will never amount to a video game, this movie got really close, but...  <br />there are a few lacking points as a FILM. For one, while many viewers may find the constant running and gasping of the main character as she runs around trying to find her daughter a bit repedative, this comprises 50% of the game play in the game... however, there is a hightend sense in the game, as you never know when something's going to try and eat, mutilate, bite, suck, or decapitate you. The movie however didn't produce such a feeling of paranoia, more like a few scenes here and there.  <br />For those of you who think Sean Bean's name means something in this film, sadly it does not. His character is a bit wasted [oops, did i say that out loud?], however, the way the movie was shown and set up, it's almost like they were deliberate in this action, as if a sequal was being made next. If not, then... Sean Bean was basically an extra. Don't get me wrong he displays exelent acting, however, he just isnt part of the action.  <br /> <br /> <br />If you havn't played the game, you might not understand it, but you may come away either totally apalled that you paid to see it/rent it/buy it due to the fact it just wasn't scary at all and you found it quiet funny [as i did the grudge and the ring], or you may think it was genienly scary enough to invite a friend next time. beware, this is a sixth sense type of movie, once you've seen it once, it just isnt th same the second time around, unless you totally forget the plot, or lack thereof.  <br />If you've played the game, then lo and behold the first movie based on a vide game that actually makes one want to play the game right after watching it. This isnt the movie that will change how people look at video game based movies, but it is a great step in the right direction [finally]. Now if only producers would get over there imortal terror of producing epic films, with a little extra flare here and there, maybe there would be even better films out there based on video games. Until then, Silent hill should keep you entertained for a little while.  <br /> <br />In all the movie there was only one scene that i found scary, and it was only because the movie theatre wasnt exacally packed, so i could totally zoom in and watch like i was there. Other than that, it never did get any scarier than that, but i still left the movie theatre and constantly looked over my shoulder once i got home... alone.  <br /> <br />If you've never heard about Silent Hill and just stumbled upon it at the movie store and rented it, hold on to the buddy beside you, and keep an open mind... and then dive into the video game, it is so much better. This movie is a good door opener to an already popular gaming series, but unless they make another one, and that one is BETTER than the first one, this movie will just be another one on the shelf after a few months.  <br /> <br />As a little girl expieriences life like dreams, and periodically sleep walks and screams \\"Silent hill!\\" one might get either a small chill, or a slight giggle at the opening sequence... the rest is, well... I give it three stars, because Having played two of the games, I know in my heart that the creator's/director... ok, the \\"whole lot\\" of people who wrote this movie, could have done much better. All in all, not a lost cause, just sorta...  <br /> <br />eh... <br />
B00000DRWB|4.0|This is when Aerosmith was still pretty young, but includes classic songs like \\"Walk This Way\\" and \\"Sweet Emotion.\\" A very good album if you like early Aerosmith songs.
B000EOTAM6|2.0|Yet another stupid stupid movie.  Sure Charlize Theron is always nice to look at on the screen, but I think it would be better to just watch her walk around talking with her real life friends than have to put up with such a silly addlebrained plot.  The science it espouses makes no sense, the fighting makes no sense (why wear bright white clothes to an attack at night?), the love relationship makes little sense, and the destruction of the technology that Aeon alone has decided must end is stupid beyond belief.<br /><br />And, by the way, a world of only five million people could not live in the luxury and with the technology this city-state (I guess a kind of advanced Singapore) generates.  Frankly, they would be scrabbling about for food and such.  Where are the food producers?  Where are the carpenters, plumbers, programmers, die makers, assemblers, cooks, gardeners, and so forth?  Calling this a parable doesn't get stupidity off the hook.<br /><br />Can we also stop, puh-leeze, with the hundred and ten pound skinny women beating up entire armies of two hundred pound males?  And why is it that the hero can spray machine gun fire into the air and each bullet takes down a bad guy, but trained and armored soldiers who happen to be bad guys can lay down focused and directed fire and produce only survivable wounds in the heroes?  That alone would make bad guys not want to go into battle, right?<br /><br />We could go on and on and on about what is wrong with this movie, but unless you are willing to see it just to look at Charlize Theron in black hair, don't bother.

B000063JDE|5.0|David Lynch is the definition of a \\"Love Him or Hate Him\\" director.  There are those who adore his mystery-laden, intellectually-challenging films, and those who can't stand them.  Lynch has had a few films in his career, however, which have been hits with critics and audiences alike.  The biggest of those was 1986's BLUE VELVET.    BLUE VELVET stars Lynch favorite Kyle MacLachlan as Jeffrey Beaumont, an extremely polite and kind young man who returns home from college when his father is hospitalized.  Home is Lumberton, a seemingly-perfect little town stuck in the 50's.  When Jeffrey discovers a severed human ear in a field, curiosity gets the best of him and he sets out on a quest to find out just what an ear is doing in a field.    To reveal much more would take away the mystery and shock which BLUE VELVET is so full of.  Although it's undoubtedly a Lynchian film, it's devoid of the dreamy fantasy and nonsensical dialogue of such Lynch films as ERASERHEAD and MULHOLLAND DR.  The story is, more or less, clear, and it's told in typical linear fashion.  No doubt this comprehensability allowed many critics to finally notice Lynch's filmmaking expertise when BLUE VELVET was released.    More than anything, the film is a visual spectacle.  Frederick Elmes' cinematography is nothing short of magnificent.  BLUE VELVET is shot like one grand, lush painting, filled with vibrant colors and beautiful imagery.  Attention is paid to every little detail of the film.  The sets are so well-decorated that they seem undoubtedly real (in the case of Dorothy Valens' apartment, chillingly so).  Isabella Rossellini, who plays mysterious club singer Dorothy Valens, once recounted a story about David Lynch making sure there was dust under a radiator which could possibly be seen clearly on-screen.  He did this just to make it real, the best it possibly could be.  Lynch's attention to detail really shines.    As in all of Lynch's films, the casting is flawless.  Undoubtedly, the standout of the cast is Dennis Hopper, in the career-reviving and now famous role of sadistic Frank Booth.  Hopper is outstanding; his Booth is likely one of the screen's greatest villains.  Booth's inhumanity and constant spewing of obscenities is at once terrifying and hilarious.    Kyle MacLachlan is a perfect fit for innocent Jeffrey Beaumont.  Laura Dern (who also starred in Lynch's WILD AT HEART) makes young Sandy Williams seem completely inculpable.  Isabella Rossellini brings out Dorothy Valens' sense of hopelessness.  Though in a supporting role, Dean Stockwell gives another stand-out performance as the unbelievably suave Ben.  George Dickerson makes Detective Williams seem strong and heroic, though I felt a twinge of uncertainty as to whose side he was on.  Lynch regular Jack Nance (ERASERHEAD) has a short but very funny role.    As is especially clear in this and MULHOLLAND DR., David Lynch has an obsession with smalltown, 50's-style America.  Lynch doesn't want to let go of this idyllic time.  At one time in the film, he voices this through Jeffrey.  Jeffrey, walking with Sandy, points out a house.  \\"Do you see that house?\\" he says.  \\"I used to know a kid who lived there.  He had the biggest tongue in the world.\\"  Sandy laughs and asks what happened to him.  Jeffrey sighs and smiles a sad smile and says, \\"I don't know.  He moved away.  All my friends are gone.\\"    Also of note is Angelo Badalamenti's excellent score.  This was Badalamenti's first collaboration with Lynch; he would collaborate with him on all of Lynch's subsequent projects.  Badalamenti's score is over-the-top and bold, bringing to mind the music of such classic thrillers as THE BIG SLEEP and THE MALTESE FALCON.  He is an extremely talented composer, and BLUE VELVET is one of his very greatest compositions.    Although BLUE VELVET was not nominated for the Best Picture Academy Award (though Lynch did receive a Best Director nomination), it was on nearly every critic's list of the best films of theyear.  When, in 1999, Entertainment Weekly released their list of the 100 greatest movies ever made, BLUE VELVET was ranked 37th on the list.  Though it's not quite David Lynch's finest film, it's definitely close.  It is one of the most important, and greatest, films of the 1980s without a doubt.  BLUE VELVET is a contemporary masterpiece, emphasizing how strange and brutal, yet beautiful, this world can be.
B000EGDC14|3.0|Over half the songs on this cd are a deliberate slap in the face to the intelligence of their previous work... <br />as much as I want to love it I find myself frequently skipping tracks because of how repetitive it is. Funny how some of the songs almost seem based on loops, like Koko. Apart from a couple songs, absolutely none of it is lush. The lyrics really aren't poetic, but rather over-simplified and very direct, like in Satin Chic: \\"You're so satin chic/Look rich talking cheap/On your telephone/Won't be coming home/He's my man\\". When elsewhere in previous work we heard beautifully, on Forever: \\"Here I wanna be a stranger, drift in and then out, just linger...\\" <br />...And I almost feel like I'm voluntarly lowering my IQ by a point each time I *TRY* to listen to Ooh La La, Lovely 2 C U, and especially Fly Me Away. In Lovely 2 C U, theyve ripped off the overlapping vocals via Tiptoe, only doing a half-@ss job. <br />As I read in an earlier review, they just re-did Black Cherry only more commercially and watered-down.
0385507755|2.0|Truly, the only thing going for this book was that it was 100%, no-holds-barred, true. I read this in a post-confession world and I tried to keep an open mind. <br /> <br />The problem with this book is it all seems to be leading towards an amazing ending but in the end it simply tears down the AA and presents an near-impossible solution. <br /> <br />I think even if the book were true it would still be dissapointing because the book is less of a memoir and more of a rant. Mediocrity struggling to make a point. I would read this if you really want to (and lets face it you will read it anyway) but keep in mind that the ending is incredibly dissapointing.
B00005KB9X|1.0|Who remastered it?  It sure wasn't Bob; find the UNremastered CD if you can.  Or better yet, - the original LP is absolutely amazing.  This remastered version is a record company trying to tell you it is \\"New and Improved\\" when it is neither. <br /> <br />For the best experience in appreciating Bob Marley and what he accomplished, read a biography, then listen to all the ORIGINAL albums.  Here are some of my favorite Bob Marley songs that are NOT usually on any best list: <br /> <br />Heathen, Small Axe, Who the Cap Fit, War, Get Up Stand Up, Johnny Was, Duppy Conqueror, Cry To Me, One Foundation.   <br /> <br />If I was forced to pick his best song it would probably be \\"War.\\"  Even though he didn't write the words and it is largely spoken, it is extremely powerful.
B000E97Y6K|5.0|King Kong directed by Peter Jackson was amazing!!  In the beginning was a little boring, but when the sotry line got towards the middle and the end, it was very good.  The special effects are so realistic and jaw-popping!!!  Peter Jackson is one of the greatest directors in Hollywood history.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|X2 adds to what the original had. More action, more mutants and a better story. Don't get me wrong, I loved the original, but this was the best between the two. The acting is as strong as every and the story is even more compelling. Alan does a fantastic job in this film as Nightcrawler. The villain of the film is interesting and the story introduces the beginning story of the Phoenix. Overall a great film that lived up to the expectations left from the first film.
0747267626|5.0|The 8th book in the Stephanie Plum series is another gem from writer, Janet Evanovich. Fans of the series could not wait to get their hands on this release, and new readers will be delighted at the antics of the characters in these books. In this installment, Stephanie's mother asks her to find a neighbor's missing relative, and family loyalty (and boredom) spurs Stephanie to take on the case. However, when she gets involved, a shady landlord starts warning her off the scent, and suddenly Stephanie finds out his henchman are following her. When various bad things start to happen, (i.e. her car gets blown up again, she is followed by someone in a bunny suit, snakes wind up in her apartment, and a dead body appears on her couch) Stephanie knows she is in way too deep. She enlists the help of the sexy Ranger to help her out of this jam, and also finds herself with help from both Grandma Mazur and Lula. All of the favorite characters from previous installments return, and their antics will have you laughing aloud.<br /><br />I cannot believe that there are people who actually have not read this series! Stephanie Plum is a hilarious character, and her slapstick comedy has made me laugh aloud at some strange times. If I read these books in front of other people, they invariably ask me what is so funny, and I can never quite relate the story as well as Ms. Evanovich can! There are few mystery books that can make me laugh as much as this series and yet keep me interested in the mystery, but this series does it all. Who else but Stephanie Plum can have every car she has ever owned wrecked in some way (they usually blow up), and be chased by a person in a bunny suit? If you have never read any of the books in the series, join the millions of others that have and get reading today!<br /><br />The first book in the series is \\"One for the Money\\". Enjoy!

0131479415|5.0|Mike's \\"User Stories Applied\\" book is continually useful.  His estimation book picks up from there and will provide even more mileage.<br /><br />I've journeyed through this book now about three times thinking about, considering, challenging, and even questioning the material itself and subsequent application.  What has made it so easy to digest is the fact that .. it is easy to digest.  Moreover, rather than belabouring me with hideous algorithms, Mike specifically takes into consideration the behavior of the customer _and_ the behavior of software solution delivery teams, role agnostic.  Many of his arguments fit well into expected Agile type environments, e.g. Scrum.  However, I've been able to use much of the material as independent components in in non-Agile unorganized software environments in a matter of hours.  What is even more helpful .. it offers common sense .. and most people get it immediately.<br /><br />Couple both of Cohn's books together and you have a logical pragmatic approach to user stories including sizing, managing, estimating, tasking, etc. through delivery.  No book can teach you to think .. you own that one.  Mike's book gives you fundamental lessons you can apply immediately.<br /><br />IMO, you can learn tools that help you think and problem solve, or you can go buy them.  Buy the book, put the tools in your head.
B00006CXXU|3.0|It's a pretty good album. At best, it's a record that truly set Xtina apart from other pop stars of her day. In my opinion, it's nothing spectacular. The main thing that mainly turns me off about Xtina (other than her over the top fashion sense and at times forced attempt to show that she's comfortable with her sexuality) is how she oversings. Yes, the girl can sing, and can hit the high notes to prove it. But at times her vocal gymnastics with those high notes are just too much on the ear. It's just too overpowering at times. Overall, though, not a bad record. If she could only be a bit more mellow with her voice, possibly showcasing her talent as a singer who can sing songs softly and simply without having to be over the top with it, than maybe i'll like her a bit more. But you gotta give this girl props, she's actually serious about music, unlike most popstars (Britney, Jessica Simpson, Ashley Simpson, Hillary Duff, etc) who're overrated for having absolutely no talent. Sadly, i think her self-made image has kind of made people underlook her talent. I think if Xtina can promote herself better, and just calm down and stop trying so hard to shock and amaze, then maybe others would see that she really is a talented and gifted young woman.
B00005JOVN|3.0|While some of the special effects are better, at least during the brief capsizing sequence, Poseidon is in no other way as good as Irwin Allen's Poseidon Adventure.  That earlier version was far more faithful to Paul Galico's novel, and part of the appeal was the all star cast giving Oscar-winning performances.  In this new exploitation, they've left out many important characters and updated the script with political \\"correctness,\\" leaving out, for instance, all references to religion.  This would be tolerable if they'd improved the story in some way, but they've added nothing original or imaginative, the plot's predictable, characters stereotyped, and it just seems like an action movie knock-off rather than \\"adventure,\\" so no wonder they dropped that word from the title.
B000E8NQU4|5.0|The first CD is the original album. Some of my favorite tracks are \\"Ride My See-Saw\\", including Grame Edge's intro \\"Departure\\" w/ his mad laughter, \\"The Actor\\", \\"Voices In The Sky\\" and my favorite \\"Legend of a Mind\\".  One thing that amazes me are the members  are so talented they can pick up an instrument for the first time & learn how to play it for a certain song. Such as John Lodge playing the Cello on \\"House of Four Doors\\", Mike Pinder exploring the sounds of the Mellotron, Justin Hayward on Sitar in \\"Visions of Pardise\\". On the inside CD cover Producer Tony Clarke notes the studio resemble a museum of musical instruments that the Moody Blues played every single note. Clarke said it best \\"...Their versatility never ceases to amaze me from Album to Album, in fact to me they will always be the smallest symphony orchestra in the world.\\" <br />The 2nd CD consist of 15 tracks some alternative, instrumental, extended and live recordings. \\"Legend Of A Mind\\"  has an alternative flute solo by Pinder. Justin's instrumental of \\"Vision of Paradise\\", and Justin's lead vocals on \\"A Simple Game\\" that Mike Pinder is noted as lead vocalist for that song. Also the live BBC Radio Sessions.  <br />The booklet includes photos and track by track background of the songs.
B000F48CD8|4.0|Once again,  Jack White showcases his musical genius, only this time in the vehicle of indie rock band THE RACONTEURS. While one must grumble over the fact that BROKEN BOY SOLDIERS is only 33 minutes in length, the product of those 33 minutes leaves no room for grumbling.  It is great to hear straight-forward rock and roll ideas in a time where straightfoward rock and roll isn't mainstream. I love hearing the very full bass lines that resemble bass lines of 60s rock and roll and the full bass sound that epitomizes R&B and urban music. It is also great to hear such creativity without overproduced guitars or overwhiny vocals which sometimes defines present day rock and roll.  Also the creativity that Jack White shows is untouchable here-- just brilliant.<br /><br />It would be over assertive to say that BROKEN BOY SOLDIERS is better than Jack White's work with THE WHITE STRIPES his main gig, but it isn't over assertive to say that it is great to see Jack White stretch out a little form his minimalist duo work to work in a fully instrumented rock band.  The production here is awesome-- there are incredible vocal harmonies, some truly \\"sick\\" guitar work, heavy-full bass lines, and excellent drum grooves that makes BROKEN BOY SOlDIERS a captivating listen and perhaps one of the most unique alternative rock projects of 2006.  Also, what is even more impressive is there is a lack of filler material;  the 10 tracks @ 33 minutes is exceptional in the sense that this album feels very tight and keeps the listener interested.<br /><br />The album starts off to a heroic star with first single \\"Steady As She Goes\\" which serves as a very great opening to the album with its thumping bass, nice electric guitar work, and a nice drum groove.  The next track proves to be just a fun and consistent, \\"Hands\\" and proves to be even catchier than the lead single.  \\"Broken Boy Soldiers\\" follows, but it isn't as strong as \\"Steady As She Goes\\" or \\"Hands\\" but is certainly a good track.  \\"Intimate Secretary\\" is very cleverly written and is followed by exceptional \\"Together\\" and \\"Level\\".  While both \\"Together\\" and \\"Level\\" are great tracks, \\"Store Bought Bones\\" certainly serves as a refreshment to an already refreshing album.  \\"Yellow Sun\\" slightly lowers the momentum, but not by much.  Any momentum lost is revived by the excellent bass thumping ballad \\"Call It A Day\\", one of my personal favorites. \\"Blue Veins\\" serves as an excellent out of the box ending to an exceptional album.<br /><br />In my opinion, just like GET BEHIND ME SATAN, Jack White has once again produced one of the most \\"genius\\" albums of the year.  It is well produced and it is a very, VERY enjoyable listen.  If you like straightfoward rock and roll, indie-rock, or things that are different than what is being played on mainstream radio, then Jack White's rock band THE RACONTEURS is definitely your cup of tea. Highly recommended.  4 Stars EASILY!imate Secretary\\" is very cleverly written and is followed by exceptional \\"Together\\" and \\"Level\\".

B00005JOE8|5.0|I first wondered why the Wachowski brothers would want <br />to make a movie based on a cartoon..as is the current <br />hype.. <br />But when I saw this movie I understood. The story is <br />filled with spiritual messages as we are now accustomed <br />to after seeing the Matrix trilogy. <br />This film goes a little further. It shows us what we <br />must accomplish on the spiritual path. The captation <br />of Evey is nothing more or less than what an initiation <br />in the mysteries must have been like...breaking the ego. <br />And how do we accomplish this? By conquering our fears. <br />And our biggest fear must be death. When we conquer our  <br />fear of death we vanquish our egos and become free man. <br />We will no longer be supressed by society and a new hope <br />will arise. <br />We must take up our crosses and follow Jesus, we must <br />lose our lifes in Christ's name to gain life. We must <br />cut through the illusion (maya) created by our egos <br />and find our true (inner)selves and find Love. <br />That's how I experienced this movie, anyway...Enjoy!
B000BMSTMS|4.0|In a day in the music industry where it seems by listening to the radio that innovation is at an all time low, certain individuals/groups and certain musical styles bring a breath of fresh air to the music industry.  While Korn is certainly not a new band and while the whole \\"rap-rock\\" or \\"rap-metal\\" movement isn't new, the ideas that Korn use on their newest album SEE YOU ON THE OTHER SIDE is certainly refreshing.<br /><br />The production on SEE YOU ON THE OTHER SIDE is top notch with a number of \\"out of the box\\" ideas.  The free use of synths on this album alongside \\"sick\\" guitar work really enhances the musical aspect of this album.  The lyrics are very out of the box too and it is always nice to hear rock and roll oriented bands find other topics beside love to write/sing about.  That isn't to say that Korn doesn't mention the subject a number of times, but the way that they discuss it is certainly unique compared to a slew of other bands and etc...<br /><br />There are a number of great numbers on this album.  First single \\"Twisted Transistor\\" wasn't a radio hit, but it is certainly a hit in my eyes.  For the rocks songs of late 2005 and early 2006, it is certainly one of the best and most unique in my eyes.  It is a mix between metal, rap, and alternative making for a great listen. \\"Politics\\" follows \\"Twisted Transistor\\" and while it isn't that caliber of that hit, it is certainly interesting and the hook is very catchy (\\"don't give a s*** about politics\\").  \\"Hypocrites\\" proves to be another out of the box idea for Korn and establishes their unique style of metal fused with rap and other unique rock and roll elements.  Other standouts include \\"Coming Undone\\", \\"Liar\\", and \\"Getting Off\\".<br /><br />Overall this is a very good album that has been slightly underrated, which is a shame considering its quality. 4 stars.
B00005JOYA|5.0|First off, you people who haven't seen this movie yet and are reviewing it need to shut your holes! I hate people who review movies they haven't seen yet. All of you need your fingers broken off so you cant type up these ridiculous reviews!  <br />Anyway, on to the movie: First off, It is actually a little closer to being a 4 star movie. I just gave it a 5 to offset some of these other bogus reviews. It is the best video game movie sofar, but it is not without its problems. Here are my very MINOR complaints: At time it seems slow, but it does keep you interested. The concept of the mother looking for her child starts to ware thin on you after an hour of watching it. However, there is enough FX, nightmarish scenery, and gore to keep any horror movie fan satisfied. There were actually some pretty cool and unique sequences in this movie. Many of which the previews don't ruin for you. I was very impressed with the violence in this. Most of the other video game movies have been very toned down compared to their game format, but this one holds true to its name. As a matter of fact, toward the end of the movie there is a scene that I will not give away, but I will say I am surprised the movie board let it slip out. Let's just say mixing violence with children tends to really hit a nerve with your average movie goers. Finally, I must add one final complaint: like all other horror movies released in the last 10 years, bad ending! Well, maybe not bad, but it could have been way better!  <br />Verdict: It is definitely worth a movie ticket, go see it. Its like taking a journey through a nightmare. Great imagination was put into this one. I plan on purchasing it when it comes to DVD. P.S. See \\"The hills have eyes\\" too!
B0009R1T7M|5.0|Illinois is not really original, rather it is a masterful assembly of well known styles, genres and ideas.  But the assembly is so masterful, you are sure you are listening to something novel.     Illinois is a concept album, obviously.  And many fine artists put together masterful concept albums in the 60s and 70s (Pink Floyd being the most obvious).  But few artists make true albums anymore, much less concept albums.  Illinois covers a lot of ground, but it has a few basic themes, lyrically and musically, it keeps coming back to.  It even ends where it begins -- with a nod to close encounters of the third kind.  You just don't see these types of album's much anymore.  Thus, while the conceptual approach is not new, it is not common, which in today's Internet, sound-byte age, makes the approach seem \\"new.\\"    Most of the melodies and harmonies on Illinois are rooted in folk, but the arrangements are decidedly non-folk.  \\"Jacksonville\\" is the only song I've ever heard where a banjo, violins and trumpets are harmonizing.  And the chanting voices (a Greek chorus, perhaps?), supported by xylophone, remind me of Stereolab's chanting from Dots and Loops.   Layered, complex arrangements are nothing new, but arrangements like these are not common.    The lyrics are not cynical, self-absorbed, materialistic or political.  Yet they are still interesting -- very interesting.  A song about the 1898 Columbian Exposition?  John Wayne Gacy?  A teenage girlfriend who is dying of cancer?  You might expect Dylan to try to tackle Gacy and Talking Heads to sing about the Exposition.  But one artist singing about all these things is impressive.  Again, nothing new about honest, quirky, interesting lyrics that take more than one listen to figure out the meaning (if there is any at all).  But when you layer this aspect of Illinois on top of the growing list of the album's other components, you start to realize the depth of Sufjan's artistry.      Even the Christian themes on the album fit the mold of \\"old as new.\\"  Christian ideas are about 2000 years old, give or take a few years, but their presentation on Illinois sounds new (or at least different) because it does not fit the current, conventional mold of doctrinaire scolding associated with Christianity (or the hollow praise found in \\"Contemporary Chirstian\\" music).  Of course, Sufjan is not the only indie rocker willing to sing about Chrisitianity in complex, questioning ways these days.  \\"Theologians\\" on Wilco's A Ghost is Born is about as direct as possible in addressing the topic.  (Nor is Sufjan the only artist challenging Postmodernism.  See \\"Young Pilgrims\\" on The Shins' Chutes Too Narrow.)      Artistry is not constant, thus not every album Sufjan releases will be as good as this one.  His 50 state idea is silly and he'll abandon it soon enough.  At least he should.  The idea makes for nice media copy, but it is restrictive.  Sufjan should roam wherever his muse takes him to do whatever he is inspired to do.  He should not restrict himself to trying to write a concept album about, say, Delaware.    Illinois is not for everyone.  It is long, has challenging arrangements (the chanting chorus can be a bit much at times), defies genre categorization, and cannot be appreciated in passing as background music.  But if you are willing to invest the time and energy, Illinois is richly rewarding.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Tool has consistently been one of my favorite bands for a long time now. I really don't give them a god-like status like some crazed fans but I think they are excellent in their own respects, especially Maynard and Danny. I came into 10,000 days actually not very sure of what to expect and I was pleasantly surprised. Believe it or not, I'd call 10,000 days a mix of undertow with all that prog metaphysics stuff from laterlus.     <br />    Songs such as The Pot and Vicarious remind me of undertow due to the sheer force of the catchiness yet distinct metalness. The Pot to me somehow always sounds like the swamp song with that incessant bass and Maynard's crooning. Rosetta stoned is also quite good and almost hypnotic. It sounds like a combination of the last track from laterlus, (the name escapes me at the moment), and third eye. Right in two sounds almost like a Perfect Circle song in the beginning and builds up to a tremulous crescendo towards the end. <br />     Some people have complained that Maynard sounds different, singing high in The Pot, and with a whole lot of vocal distortion in others, but is always good to experiment with your sound and grow as an artist. I think the expectations for this album were so crushingly high that nothing could live up to them save for a musical epiphany about the meaning of life as defined through a logarithmic spiral spoken by a monkey or something could live up to it. <br />
B000054OXU|1.0|Let me start by saying that Neil Young is probably my all-time favorite rock-and-roll artist.  I own thirty of his albums and still eagerly await each new release.  But this turkey is the only Neil Young album I ever actually sold back used.  I can not say a single good thing about it.<br /><br />Simply put, \\"Landing On Water\\" was a ghastly miscalculation by the master.  How Neil could have thought that a collection of mediocre songs driven primarily by synthesizers was a good idea is beyond me.  And while I have often been pleasantly surprised by some of his more unconventional projects (the Shocking Pinks, for example), my only reaction to this album was horror.<br /><br />If you want to hear Neil doing something interesting with synths, check out \\"Trans.\\"  Avoid this disaster at all costs!

0307276902|4.0|The biggest qualm I have about this book is not that it is innacurate, but that it was couched as biography when it should have been fiction.  I don't know the full dealings of Mr. Frey with his publisher, but it seems to me that the book may have appeared more profitable if they pretended that all of it was indeed true.  Why does suffering to a concievable degree have to be real for us to appreciate it or learn from it?  The mere fact that many people came forth to say that it made a sizable impact on their lives is proof that, albeit not entirely true,  James Frey was capable of moving people in a significant way, and that is why this book is worth reading. <br /> <br />The book is a quick read, and it's hard to put down.  I think that a large portion of the other commenters on this site had the expectation of a happy ending, but the fact that this book strays from the ususal expection of that makes it all the more original.
1400079179|2.0|First of all, it's awful as a novel.  It's not a great thriller, as its fans contend.  It's awful.  Anyone who compares it with the competition knows this.  Dan Brown is not much of a writer.<br /><br />Second, its historical pretensions are ridiculous -- and Dan Brown knows that they are.  The central idea -- that conventional Christianity was invented by Constantine the Great centuries after Christ -- is completely untenable.  We have references from outside the church recognizing Christian beliefs (e.g., the divinity of Christ) as far back as the Pliny the Younger at the beginning of the second century.  Also, we know that heterodox church traditions outside the Roman world, in Assyria and India, accepted the divinity of Christ without any pressure from Constantine.  Dan Brown's historical folderol is about equivalent to claiming that Richard the Lionhearted was the father of William the Conqueror: it's completely upside down.<br /><br />But Dan Brown is gifted with a peculiar marketing genius -- and deserves all the millions he can earn from it.  He knew exactly what kinds of historical falsifications he could market to the book-buying public.<br /><br />He's certainly shining much brighter than his fans -- who have to be the most gullible creatures who have ever glanced at a page of print.
B000EJ9MTW|5.0|The track \\"Woman\\" sounds a LOT like \\"Hundred Mile High City\\" by Ocean Colour Scene, which was featured in the movie Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels.  Both songs are good, but you can definately tell this band has heard that song.  The similarities are striking.  Anyway, this is a good, classic styled rock album.  It's good to see real rock is coming back.

0553208845|5.0|There is no wonder why this book was a Nobel Prize-winner. It is a beautifully written spiritual quest. The story is about a handsome, intelligent young man named Siddhartha who goes on a journey for inner peace. In order to accomplish this, he abandons his family and religion in search of enlightenment:<br /><br />\\"But where was this Self, this innermost? It was not flesh  or bone, it was not thought or consciousness. That was what the  wise men taught. Nobody showed the way, nobody knew it--neither his father, nor the teachers and wise men, nor the holy songs...their holy books knew everything, everything; they had gone into everything--the creation of the world, the orgin of speech...the arrangement of the senses, the acts of gods. They knew a  tremendous number of things--but was it worth knowing all these things if they did not know the one important thing, the only important thing?\\"<br /><br />Anyone who finds even a remote interest in spiritualism will love this book. It is bound to influence you somehow -- in a positive way (as in possibly joining  Siddhartha, and the quest for inner peace). Since I read the book I have gained a new respect for Buddhism.<br /><br />A must read for those who enjoy books like the Alchemist.
1580086810|5.0|Menzel is groundbreaking and stands alone in his quest to show the world to his readers.  Each of his photographs tell a unique story, leaving the reader to make his or her own interpretations.  The book is also well documented with facts and statistics about each country's food consumption habits.  I appreciate how Menzel views each culture through the lens of a specific theme, such as food, possessions, and bug eating!

6305090564|4.0|this little horror/action/ comedy(yes it really is all those things ) is just so much fun you can't help but like it. the monster is a cheesey blast,the action is well done, and the comedy is very funny is a sick way. <br />   not much sense as a cruise ship about to be highjacked is attacked by \\"sea monsters\\" from the deep. like i said this is just to much fun to take seriously and if you let it you can get sweapted away with it.
B000E1ZBFY|5.0|I would think the best words used to describe this movie were expressed by Pope Benedict XVI:      ADDRESS OF HIS HOLINESS BENEDICT XVI   AT THE VIEWING OF A FILM  ON THE LIFE OF POPE JOHN PAUL II       Thursday, 19 May 2005       Dear Brothers and Sisters,     I am certain to interpret the common sentiments and express living gratitude to those who wanted to offer me and all of you the opportunity to view this moving film tonight; it traces the life of young Karol Wojtya, leading to his election as the Pontiff known as \\"John Paul II\\".     I greet and thank Cardinal Roberto Tucci for his introduction to the film. I then address a word of admiration to the director and writer, Giacomo Battiato, and to the actors, especially Piotr Adamczyk who played the part of John Paul II, to the producer Pietro Valsecchi and to the networks \\"Taodue\\" and \\"Mediaset\\".     I cordially greet the other Cardinals, Bishops, priests, Authorities and all those who wanted to take part in this viewing in honour of the beloved Pontiff, recently deceased. We all remember him with deep affection and heartfelt gratitude. Yesterday, he would have celebrated his 85th birthday.     \\"Karol, un uomo diventato Papa\\" [Karol, a man who became Pope] is the title of the drama, taken from a text by Gian Franco Svidercoschi. The first segment, as we have seen, highlights the situation in Poland under the Nazi regime, with emphasis - now and then very emotionally strong - given to the repression of the Polish people and to the genocide of the Jews. These are atrocious crimes that show all of the evil that was contained in the Nazi ideology.     Young Karol, shocked by so much suffering and violence, decided to do something about it in his own life, answering the divine call to the priesthood. The film presents scenes and episodes that, in their severity, awaken in the viewers an instinctive \\"turning away\\" in horror and stimulates them to consider the abyss of iniquity that can be hidden in the human soul.At the same time, calling to the fore such aberration revives in every right-minded person the duty to do what he or she can so that such inhuman barbarism never happens again.     Today's viewing takes place just some days after the 60th anniversary of the end of the Second World War. On 8 May 1945 the conclusion was marked of that frightful tragedy which sowed destruction and death, in a measure never-before heard of, in Europe and in the world.     Ten years ago, John Paul II wrote that World War II appears with evermore clarity as a \\"suicide of humanity\\". Each time a totalitarian ideology crushes man, humanity as a whole is seriously threatened. With the passing of time, memories do not have to fade; rather, they must be a stern lesson for this and future generations. We have the responsibility of reminding especially youth of the forms of unprecedented violence that can lead to contempt for men and women and the violation of their rights.     Under the light of Providence, how can we not read as a divine plan the fact that on the Chair of Peter, a Polish Pope is succeeded by a citizen of that Country, Germany, where the Nazi regime was the most vicious, attacking the nearby nations, Poland among them?     In their youth, both of these Popes - even if on opposing fronts and in different situations - knew the cruelty of the Second World War and of the senseless violence of men fighting men, people fighting people.     During the final days of the Second Vatican Council held here in Rome, the Polish Bishops consigned the \\"letter of reconciliation\\" to the German Bishops; the letter contained those famous words that today too resound in our souls: \\"We forgive and we ask forgiveness\\".     In last Sunday's Homily I reminded the newly-ordained priests that \\"nothing can improve the world if evil is not overcome. Evil can be overcome only by forgiveness\\" (L'Osservatore Romano English Edition, 18 May, p. 7). May the mutual and sincere condemnation of Nazism, as with atheistic communism, be everyone's duty for the building of reconciliation and peace on forgiveness.     \\"To forgive\\", our beloved John Paul II again reminds us, \\"does not mean to forget\\", adding that \\"if memory is the law of history, forgiveness is the power of God, the power of Christ that works in the vicissitudes of man\\" (cf. Insegnamenti di Giovanni Paolo II, XVII/2 [1994], p. 250). Peace is, in the first place, a gift of God, who makes sentiments of love and solidarity arise in the heart of the person who welcomes it.     I hope that, thanks also to this witness of Pope John Paul II commemorated in this meaningful film, there will be a revival on the part of each person in the proposal to work - each in his or her own field and according to one's means - at the service of a definite action for peace in Europe and in the entire world.     I entrust the hope of peace that all of us carry in our heart to the maternal intercession of the Virgin Mary, who is venerated especially in this month of May. May she, Queen of Peace, encourage the generous contribution of those who intend to put their efforts toward the building of true peace on the solid pillars of truth, justice, freedom and love. With these sentiments, I extend to all my Apostolic Blessing.    -- POPE BENEDICT XVI      [...]

B00004XQ8E|5.0|There are times when you can't let something pass.  I've heard this nonsense about how Bruno Walter \\"didn't understand Mahler.\\" The fact that Walter knew Mahler well and worked with him gave him far better insight into the composer than those commenting almost a century after the fact. The poetry in this performance is there for those whose who are capable of hearing it. Stating that Ferrier was past her prime seems odd in that she was about 40 when this recording was made and if made in 1951 it would have been two years before her death. She was a true contralto (the voice for which the music was written)with a tonal color that any mezzo-soprano can only approximate. Regarding this not being opera it might do well to remember that Mahler was primarily a conductor of opera. Would this have influenced how he may have wanted this work performed? I think so.

B0000CD5FN|5.0|Streetcore is an album and a musical genre in the sense that it is an idea you think when you make music. According to Joe Strummer, \\"Streetcore is a distillation of all the most extreme psycadelic music, showing lenghty knowledge of reggae, dub, funk, blues, jazz, folk, hip hop.\\" This album is amazing, and I guarantee that if you pop this into your CD player, sit down and listen to the entire album straight through, you will feel better. At the end of the last song, you will feel this certain aware calmness. You will feel at peace. For whom music is an anti drug, Streetcore is a clear moment, and for those whom music is an irresistable drug, Streetcore is a pillowcase full, an expression of rythm and color and every single emotion in one moment. Streetcore is a murmur from a departed friend. Fortunately, once put into a CD player, that murmur becomes more. Thank you, Joe, and thank you, Mescaleros, because you guys don't get nearly enough praise as you brilliant musicians deserve. Peace be with you.

B000EMGAOY|5.0|Their best album ever. It's no coincidence that reviews are recognizing that after a few days, it grows on you, so has the band. I guess we starved for four years and now we have indigestion... Take the time to listen to John's solos and Anthony' singing ( Flea has always been the greatest bass player) and you'll see that now their technique matches their soul. Although its probably not the best song Snow is the one I cant get out of my head. Hard to concentrate and Turn it again ( check your pulse if your fingers dont play an imaginary guitar when you listen to it ) are the highlights of Mars. And for the ones that complain about the double album, lets go back to basics: more for the same money = good; less for the same money = bad... <br />They made us wait but it was worth it...
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|Titanic is the best film ever made and frankly .. my all time favorite.  I mean i love love love loved it.  everything about it.  I've been watching it all the time since i was six and i can practically recite the whole movie.  How could u not like it?  It has sadness, funiness, and it set on the doomed ship.  The special effects are amazing for their time and the story line is amazin too giving us some lines we'll NEVER forget!  Honestly in my book there is no movie greater than this one.  And personally how could u not like the special edition even more?  I mean it has deleted scenes and such.  lets just say that i love this movie and i loved the special edition even more!  Ok well go buy its its amaaaaaaaaazing!
B000F1IQN2|2.0|When I rented this movie, I thought that it would be about the murders of the Israeli Olympic athletes, an event which I remember with great sadness.  This event does occur in the DVD, but it is right at the beginning and the rest of the movie concerns the attempt on the part of Israel to avenge the murders and to kill those responsible.  The narrative is often confusing, and the movie is full of bloody scenes of murder and mayhem, none of which was very appealing to me.  The point of the movie seems to be that revenge never really works and it only becomes dehumanizing to those who engage in it.  I wish I had not sat through almost three hours of this movie in order to come to that conclusion.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|This is one of those DVDs you can start, sit back and don't stand up until it ends. I love it ! At the first part of the concert, just as in the Concert for Bagladesh, there's an indian music section directed by Shankar's daughter (Nora Jones Sister). Before I see this part I tought it could be boring but it isn't. It is wonderful. <br />Tho only thing that I miss in this George Harrison tribute is the precense of Bob Dylan who hasn't been there...I can't imagine why. <br />You can here and see many Gorge's friends singing his songs together (Eric Clapton, Tom Petty; Jef Lyne, Paul MCartney, Ringo Star; etc, etc). If you still don't bought it, do it, it is wonderful.
B000AA305M|5.0|Saw David Gray in concert in 2000 in Austin, TX at a small bar. He played the White Ladder album and it was amazing. Had the priviledge of seeing him perform in Boston Fall 2005 - Life in Slow Motion in concert was mesmerizing. One of the best concerts I have ever attended - if not the best. The cd gets better and better and better with each listen. Nuanced and wonderful. Alibi, One you Love, Slow Motion (showcased on the season finale of NBC's Conviction yesterday) are my favorites. If you get one cd, get this one.
B000AL730Y|4.0|First of all let me tell you that I'm a very big McCartney fan. I love CDs like \\"Pipes of peace\\"; \\"Band on the run\\"; \\"Tug of war\\"; \\"London town\\"; \\"Off the ground\\". This one has very nice songs, in some way sounds like in the 60's or 70's, but, for me, Paul can do much more than this. This is a good album if you don't think this is Paul McCartney, but, knowing this are their songs, I need more. <br />Maybe he wasn't living the best moment of his life when he did it, but I bet his next album will be much better than this one. <br />So, this is a good album but don't expect to hear some genius songs. <br />The DVD included in this CD is nice. A good piece.
B000EULJLU|5.0|To start, I will admit, I am one of those rabid fans. I cannot get enough of the music that TOOL creates. ?nima has been by far my favorite album, that is until now. In 10,000 days we hear so much more creative effort flowing from the speakers into our ears than in previous efforts from TOOL. This is not an album for the casual fan of the band, or any of those \\"I LIKE TOOL, JUST TO BE COOL\\", type of people. The lyrics are where the real genius of TOOL lies, and always has. With the album timing in at over 75 minutes long, one has to be prepared for the brain messaging words and music being thrown at the mind. Like previous outings such as Lateralus and Undertow, TOOL takes an extremely artistic creative approach to their music and gives the listener the chance to connect with the music on various levels, whether it be melodramatic, hard-driven, or even extremly soft and feminine. TOOL leaves it to the listener to decipher the meaning of the songs themselves and find their own personal relation to each track. I myself was a tiny bit disappointed in Lateralus, as I always felt that TOOL was veering away from what had made them so great before, however any feelings I may have harbored that TOOL was making a backwards slide have been erased by 10,000 days. Anybody saying 10,000 days is not a good/great album apparently has no right speaking their mind on the matter, as they simply cannot comprehend what TOOL is trying to relay, nor do they have the mental capacity to make sense of the messages the tracks are trying to relate. If your a true fan of TOOL, then I say \\"GO BUY THIS ALBUM NOW\\"!!!, however if your a casual fan and only like to listen to what is readily available through commercial radio or are one of the posers who only \\"LIKE TOOL TO BE COOL\\", then I would suggest you stay away from this album, because you more than likely will miss the entire point of what the band has spent 5 years trying to accomplish, and then end up giving poorly rated reviews, and undeserved negativity.
B00005JOTV|4.0|So the movie ... is okay. I actually laughed out loud when McFly was onscreen - specifically Danny's 'wrong eye' mistake, but of course - they were the reason I actually went to see the movie. <br /> <br />It does have it's funny parts, but most of the jokes never follow through to their full potential. The chemistry between wonderful Chris Pine and Lindsay Lohan is there in the movie, which gives it more points. Lindsay did a good job, though, as usual. I don't regret seeing it because I did leave the theatre feeling good about everything. Completely predictable, but good overall. <br /> <br />As a McFly fan, I was sad they were hardly on the screen (but it's not their movie I know hehe) and they should've played a lot more of their music throughout the movie during other scenes. I know of plenty songs of theirs that would fit perfectly and help promote them here in America which was the aim of them being in this film in the first place. <br /> <br />Here's truth about McFly: They are huge in the UK. They are very talented. They're music is worth buying, so buy it. They write and play their own music. They deserve fame in America because too many people without enough talent are famous, and we need musicians that are really, really talented like they are. <br />Yes, yes, I know that Dougie is \\"so hot\\" - i only hear it from the girls at school every day that see their picture on my myspace, but let's not forget Danny. Okay? Honestly. Harry and Tom too.  <br /> <br />So anyway. McFly is brilliant, buy their music, give them the American fame they should have, and be the happiest person ever. Please. They're bound to leave a legacy here. Now just let them do it.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I might be the very last hopeless romantic to lay eyes on this movie, but just in case I'm not, let me tell you how much I LOVED it.  I just got done watching it on DVD and I can honestly say I loved every minute of it.  All throughout this movie, you get to see how people must have acted back in that time.  All the women curtsey to everyone they meet and people are just formal in general.  The landscape of this movie was beautiful.  There were also very slight, but very funny little moments between the sisters, the mother, the father and the upper class of this movie.  I started out not even liking the main male character in this movie, and ended up loving him at the end.  It's like you were able to witness Lizzie and Mr. Dausey fall in love, every step of the way.  This movie made me laugh and cry and want it to never end.  It was one of the most romantic movies I have ever seen.  If you're a woman and you haven't seen this movie yet - you better get your butt to a movie rental store and rent it right away!
B0002DB0FO|5.0|The first season of Everwood is so phenomenal and heart breaking, you can't help but love it. Its a realistic down-to-earth family drama that many people have come to enjoy. The issues that Everwood deals with are sometimes controversial, i.e. Abortion, HIV, Medical Marijuana, etc... But, you shouldn't worry. Everwood handles each issue with care and you shouldn't be displeased. Its worth watching and buying over and over. <br /> <br />For all of those who are panicking about Seasons 2-4, fear not. ABC Family has the rights to ALL of the seasons, so find out what channel your ABC Family is and watch, cause this appears to be the only way to see the other seasons.
0671027344|4.0|I want to start off by saying that while I am only 14, and many people would say that I did not fully grasp the meaning of this book, that I think that I completely understood it and felt like it was my own life being told through the pages. Charlie is going through things that many people have in their life. Seeing people they love dating other people. The suicide of a close friend. Not everyone has been molested, though. It is true that Charlie is not an ordinary 16 year old boy. He has dealt with many trials in his 16 years that many teenagers do not face. And he is always honest. He says what he is feeling. My favorite part was when he said he felt \\"infinite\\". I can understand that feeling, and that made me feel closer to Charlie. All in all, I would recommend that every teen read this book, but this book is now so close to my heart I feel jelous when I see other people reading it.
B00005JMAH|4.0|Based on J. K. Rowling's book, \\"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\\" covers the boy wizard's third year at Hogwarts and hit the big screen in 2004. The film opens at Privet Drive with the end of the summer holidays approaching. The previous summer, at the start of the Chamber of Secrets, Harry had been blamed by the Ministry of Magic for a spell performed by Dobby the House Elf in Dursley's house. This summer, Harry panics as he accidentally casts a spell on Uncle Vernon's thoroughly obnoxious sister. Knowing he's in trouble, he decides to go on the run - but, following a bumpy ride on the Knight Bus, the Minister for Magic corners him at Diagon Alley. Harry is somewhat surprised to be let off, given the trouble he got into the previous year - but relieved all he same.      The Magic Community seems to be much more concerned with a very dangerous criminal called Sirius Black, the first person to escape from Azkaban (the wizard prison). He had been sent there after being found guilty of murdering thirteen people - twelve of them muggles - with a single curse about twelve years earlier. Widely believed to have been a big supporter of Voldemort's, the rumour is he's hunting for Harry. As a result, some Azkaban guards (terrifying creatures, known as Dementors) have been posted at Hogwarts for the protection of the pupils and staff.      Harry is, once again, joined by Ron and Hermione at Hogwarts. There's a bit of trouble between Harry's two friends, however. Much of that is caused by Hermione's new pet Crookshanks - a crazy cat, who seems determined to kill Scabbers, Ron's rat, at every opportunity. This year's Defence Against The Dark Arts teacher, is Professor Lupin who - like the Dementors, the three friends meet him for the first time on the Hogwarts Express. Despite the fact he dresses rather shabbily and gets strangely ill from time to time, Lupin actually seems to know what he's doing. He also proves to be highly popular with the majority of pupils, particularly Harry. There are a couple pf other new teachers introduced this year - one of them is Hagrid, who has taken over the Care of Magical Creatures class. Unfortunately, his first lesson leads to a bit of trouble with a Hippogriff. Another is Professor Trelawney, the Divination teacher - who seems to be a bit of a crackpot. In their first lesson, she somehow picks out the Grim (a death omen) from Harry's tealeaves. Harry probably wouldn't have been too worried, only he'd already seen something of a death omen just as he was boarding the Knight Bus.      The movie is very enjoyable, though a good deal darker than I had imagined. Despite the criticism I've heard of their performances in the previous films, I thought Daniel Ratcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint were very good in their roles. (Draco, Harry's arch nemesis, would've stolen the show had his role been any bigger : Tom Felton plays the part of a strutting, arrogant, little twerp superbly. One of the most enjoyable scenes came when Hermione puts him firmly in his place). Professor Trelawney was also an enjoyable addition, played by the barely recognisable Emma Thompson. (Her ex-husband, of course, was also once on the teaching staff at Hogwarts : Ken Brannagh played the part of Gilderoy Lockhart in \\"The Chamber of Secrets\\"). For fans of the Stone Roses, meanwhile, Ian Brown stops by the Leaky Cauldron for a quick drink. The film's effects are hugely impressive, especially the Dementors : their first appearance on the train was the best scene in the film for me. Parts of the book have been minimised or dropped - particularly the 'history' of the Marauder's Map, its authors and how Lupin knew how to use it. However, it's a very enjoyable movie and is highly recommended.

B00005JOVN|5.0|Wolfgang Petersen Knocked it out of the ballpark with this film! I must admit, I have never actually seen the first \\"Poseidon adventure,\\" but from those that I have talked to that have, this is a very different movie.<br /><br />The movie is about a ill-fated ship called Poseidon. The ship is hit by a rogue wave and sinks, UPSIDE DOWN! That's the part of the story that we all know. The characers, special effects, and heart pounding suspense are what makes the movie a home run!<br /><br />The movie focuses on about 9 characters, which makes it very different from James Cameron's Titanic. Instead of getting emotionally invested in just one couple, the movie goer has to split their attachment amung these characters. It is inevitiable that you will pick a favorite two or three that you want to make it.<br /><br />Regarding the nine characters, there's not a lot of background given, but there is just enough that you care about the people.  Josh Lucas plays Dylan Johns who is a professional gambler, Kurt Russell who plays Robert Ramsey, a former mayer of NYC and a former figher captain. They are the main stars of the film. Also aboard the doomed ship are his Daughter who is played by Emmy Rossum and her fiance' played by Mike Vogel. Jacinda Barrett plays a single mother who is aboard with her 10 year old son. Two more charcters worth mentioning are played by Mia Maestro (a stoaway who is traveling to NYC to see her sick brother), and Richard Dryfuss who plays a man who has been dumped by his lover and in his mind has little reason to live.<br /><br />These characters all band together to try to escape from the sinking Poseidon against the wishes of the captain. What follows is absolute heart pounding suspsense!!! The movie is not very long, but for about a hour out of the hour and a half I was a nervous and emotional wreck. It is nearly impossible to predict who lives and who dies and I liked that!!! Every element of a good suspense film was here, however, I must say that the dramatic elements of this film are what I enjoyed the most.<br /><br />My only problem with this movie was that it was not longer. It was kinda obvious that it had been edited within a inch of its life and I think I would have enjoyed it even if it was 30-60 minutes. I hope the DVD release rectifies that.<br /><br />All of that said, my reccomendation is to go see this movie!!! This the kind of movie that just about everyone that sees it will find something that they enjoy.at the dramatic elements of this film are what I enjoyed the most.  <br /> <br />My only problem with this movie was that it was not longer.

B000ETQRCM|5.0|i have been listening to pearl jam since 1992...and seen them close to 30 times.  this album is without a doubt, the best...ever?  maybe since ten.  they both rival each other with thier simplicity as well as complexity.  if you dont have this album...cd...whatever...you are an idiot.  it doesn't get ANY better than this.
B000002W3R|4.0|Moody Blue was Elvis Presley's final album to be released, not counting the numerous repackagings and complations that flood the market these days.  <br />I just heard Moody Blue for the first time last week. I suprised at how much I enjoyed the album. How could you not, with all the covers. I belive there were only two originals on the whole album. So in a way I guess the album is more or less a throwaway album, but it's entertaining and as far as I'm concerned that's enough to make a good album, so if you enjoy a little Elvis check Moody Blue out.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|You dont need to read some long drawn out review to make a decision. Its very simple; if you like the last few Red Hot Chili Peppers albums such as \\"By the Way\\" for example, this album continues the excellence. Even though its two discs, there are no fillers, just great songs after great songs. I have been a huge fan of theirs since tha late 80's. Yes, this is a more slick, well produced, less edgy album than their early music. But hey, do expect a group to stay the same? Its silliness to expect them to continue to remake \\"Mothers Milk\\" over and over. This is a flat out great album. Buy it if you are in the least a Red hot Chili Peppers Fan.
B000F1IQN2|5.0|The plot of this film has to do with the ongoing conflict between Jews and Palistenians.  So I'm sure Mr. Speilberg is trying to make some kind of statement about the nature of revenge, violence, and the Israeli- Palestinian conflict.   <br /> <br />But if you could care less about such things, this film is gripping from start to finish.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|I must start this review by saying that I have not bought a RHCP's CD since BSSM...it's been a while... <br /> <br />I bought this double album on day one, and was blown away. While there are several slow songs that may not appeal to the old pepper's crowd, their evolution is amazing. Frusciante is simply unbelievable- I really came to appreciate his skills as a result of my buddy's Frusciante solo albums...this guy doesn't get the credit he should. <br /> <br />I personally love both albums, but find myself listening more Mars. There are at least 5 solid singles on each album, along with 2-3 additional solid b-sides. For those saying that this should have been one record and it \\"would have been a classic\\"- get a grip...respect the peppers for fighting off the record company, and putting out a package of goods, rather than something aimed at selling more...it's crazy that the \\"fans\\" are complaining because \\"their\\" band put out too much material...what a joke. Most bands don't have the b_lls to put out a double record, and instead save the material for box-sets...this is a solid collection, and as a major music and casual RHCP fan, this is about as good as it gets. <br /> <br />Buy this record, listen through 2-3 times with a beer (or 12) and just enjoy...this is amazing <br /> <br />
1400062071|3.0|I really enjoyed AMY & ISABELLE, and couldn't wait to read Ms. Stout's newest novel.  After waiting so long, it left me a little bit disappointed.  ABIDE WITH ME reads more like a character study and/or an essay about small town life rather than a novel with a storyline, plot, climax and ending.   I honestly didn't care much about any of the characters and although the novel did have a final outcome and conclusion, it seemed a little incomplete with several loose ends. <br /> <br />For example, Katherine.  I don't think readers ever learn why the child is so troubled throughout most of the story.  We hear what her teacher, principal and school therapist believe, but this theory takes up an entire 2-3 pages of the book and is never  fully examined.  Nothing really is, actually.  Just all of a sudden, one night she has a talk with her father, and the next thing you know, she's on the road to becoming a \\"normal\\" child again. <br /> <br />This is actually a problem throughout the book.  There are so many characters, so many names.  Readers learn bits and pieces about each one, but no one is closely examined.  The reason behind the gossip and rumors is never addressed, and it gets tedious and boring after a while.  Was the town so bored with themselves and their lives that they thought they had nothing else better to do?  And it's sudden end is a little hard to believe too.  As much as these women gossiped throughout the book, for them to end it so suddenly, just doesn't really make sense.   <br /> <br />I also didn't understand the relationship with the housekeeper.  What caused her to break her silence after so many years, and why did everyone dislike her so much?  And Charlie?  Was there a purpose to his story? (which I don't think quite fit in with the rest of the story).  He's a rather unlikable character throughout the story, and it seems like the author was trying to redeem him in the end, but it seemed a little forced.  After what wer learn about him, why would he of all people, be the one to reach out??  Even the minister's late wife, Lauren - it would appear that the author is trying to protray the character as having some type of psychological disorder, but what?  Bipolar disease?  Dissociative Identity Disorder (multiple personalities)? Did her illness do this to her?  Or was she just high maintenance?  The author never fully explores this, or fills in the blanks. <br /> <br />There is a lot going on here for such a short book (285 pages), and I didn't feel like the story was taking me anywhere.  I actually skimmed over several pages, as the author spends a great deal of time talking about descriptions and what people are thinking about, when it really has no relevance to what's going on in the story during that point in time.  It also took several chapters to get going.  I really thought about returning the book once I started reading it because it seemed to take forever to pull the reader in.  Once it had my attention, though, I never found the answers I was looking for and I lost my interest several times.  I really had to force myself to finish reading this, which is not how I like to read my books. <br /> <br />I'm hoping Elizabeth Stoud continues writing, however.  As AMY AND ISABELLE proved, she's capable of writing powerful, meaningful words.  ABIDE WITH ME could have been just as good, and it sounded like it had a lot of promise, but it just seem to fizzle somewhere along the line.

Christian Bale is an absolutely perfect and believable Bruce Wayne, Nolan is an amazing director, and Michael Kane owns you and your entire family.  Best superhero movie to date; however, wait for Bryan Singer's \\"Superman\\" set for a June 30th release. I'm pretty sure that will take the title of best superhero movie, but \\"Batman Begins\\" will remain a close second.

006054094X|3.0|The idea that the Chinese might have reached America during the Ming voyages is not nearly as implausible as many of the other reviewers have written. As Menzies point out, the Ming Chinese created enormous and technologically advanced ships for the age. <br />It is well-documented that these ships made it as far as Africa, and North America is, after all, just a straight shot across the Pacific. It's a very long straight shot, but a straight shot nonetheless. And had the Chinese sailed North to the Bering Strait, across and and south again, they could, in fact, have made the trip almost without leaving sight of land. Indeed, it has been theorized that the ancient Asians who colonized America <br />may have used boats to aid them for parts of the journey.  <br /> <br />The Chinese were, in fact, quite technologically advanced. In the Song Dynasty, only a few centuries before, they had clearly been the most technologically advanced society in the world. No doubt, they remained ahead of Europe in some ways during the Ming. The idea that the native North Americans could have just as easily discovered China, as written by another reviewer, is assinine. The Chinese were vastly more technologically advanced. <br /> <br />The time period mentioned by Menzies does not seem absurd. The year that Menzies claims the Chinese discovered America is much later than the first visit by the Norse and only a few decades prior to Columbus' \\"discovery\\" of America. <br /> <br />Some of the evidence Menzies claims -- such as what he claims to be a Chinese junk in a Sacramento river -- would certainly be strong evidence if confirmed. Some of his other claims do not seem entirely unreasonable. The idea that Chinese might have reached Australia, for example, strikes me as quite reasonable, and the evidence reasonably good. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, most of Menzies' evidence is thin and circumstantial, and some of his claims seem rather absurd. He claims that most European mariners were using maps originally created by the Chinese and passed to Europe through the person of one Italian merchant, whom, he thinks, must have met the Chinese in India and gotten the information from them. He has no particular evidence for this claim other than the fact that the Italian was in India about the same time as the Chinese fleet. This is unfortunate because so much of his book rests on the premise. Menzies repeatedly points to maps of areas that apparently pre-date known European voyages to the area and assumes that they must have been made by the Chinese. Surely there must be other explanations for these apparent discrepancies between map dates and known voyages that are at least equally plausible.  <br /> <br />If you do not accept this claim regarding the ultimate source of the map information, large parts of Menzies' claims fall apart.  <br />The claim that the Ming fleets rounded the Horn of Africa and came up the west side seems to rest entirely on a rock that may have contained Indian calligraphy. (Some Indians seem to have accompanied the Chinese sailors.)  <br /> <br />Menzies' credibility is also undermined by the audacity of some of his claims. Despite the title of the book, he doesn't limit himself to the claim that the Chinese discovered America. He also claims that they circumnavigated the globe just like Magellan, but in the opposite direction, charted Antarctica, established colonies in North and South America, circumnavigated Greenland and built the Bimini Road and a village of stone buildings on the Bache Peninsula of Greenland. I understand that all documentation of the Ming Voyages was destroyed when the Chinese government changed and repudiated them. But surely if all of this were true, there would be more evidence than a few scratchings on rocks. <br /> <br />Then, of course, there is the fact that they never made it to Europe, the part of the world most likely to maintain some evidence of their presence.
B000021YQV|5.0|There's no reason to individualy evaluate the songs for any of you SoaD fans...you love all their stuff.  This is second only to their debut, which was the most original CD since Antichrist Superstar. The only songs you can really be picky about (casual rock fans) are Prison Song, Jet Pilot, and X.  Prison Song is really goofy and has a lot of talking in it.  It basically an aquired taste.  Jet Pilot doesn't really have much to it.  The guitar can be annoying and the lyrics aren't all that special.  X is the same, really, just shorter.  Toxicity is what pumped life back into metal with their rhythmic and toned guitars, original, serious/carefree lyrics, and brisk humor.  Buy Toxicity and you may take your place among true rockers.
B000065U1N|5.0|It was amazing, the hostility that this film garnered from reviewers at liberal and leftwing media outlets.  The presentation of the bald facts--American soldiers, trying to ram humanitarian aid through the barriers thrown up by a genocidal warlord, shooting it out with said warlord's gunmen--stuck in the lefties' craw in the worst way.  \\"Jingoism!\\" \\"Flag-waving!\\" \\"Ethnocentrism!\\" \\"Lack of historical context!\\" And on and on, as they recoiled from the filmic depiction of the American martial virtues, like vampires fleeing the sunrise.  Going through old reviews, I saw that they much preferred things like the ambiguities of the anachronistic hippy-dips in The Thin Red Line.  The notion of a big-budget major studio film made in the 21st century that, without so much as a hiccup of nuance, takes the American military's side against a Third World enemy, left them completely flabbergasted with outrage.<br /><br />Black Hawk Down is about duty, honor, fighting for the buddy next to you, and not much more.  Its documentary value aside, it is primarily an actioner, though one which never veers into cartoonish Stallone territory.  The film advances no judgment on the merits of the American presence in Somalia, but neither does it cater to liberals, anxiously waiting for the reassuring moral equivalence to kick in.<br /><br />There is a surprising amount of humor here, even in the battle scenes, such as when a Ranger and two Delta operators decoy and ambush a Somali bazooka shooter.<br /><br />The sets are letter-perfect, and the special effects are always in the service of the story, never taking center stage for their gee-whiz value.  Only once or twice do the filmmakers switch to slo-mo, to highlight some appalling disaster or other.  And this film is LOUD!  At two hours plus, your ringing ears can only marvel that the actual battle lasted 16 hours.<br /><br />One quibble I have is with the casting of the Somalis.  The gunmen are all sub-Saharan Africans in appearance, not at all resembling the aquiline, gracile faces of the ethnicities from the Horn of Africa.  It's as if Japanese extras were playing the Cambodians in The Killing Fields.<br /><br />The only other false note comes at the end, when a couple of the Rangers discuss the nature of patriotism and valor under fire.  I have no first hand knowledge, but I've always imagined combat soldiers leaving such things strictly unsaid.<br /><br />Before Mark Bowden wrote the book Black Hawk Down, the Army supposedly had never even written an after-action report of the battle.  Thanks to the book but double-thanks to this film, these heroes' bravery and devotion to each other will be long remembered.  The American military family and their supporters appreciate this implicitly, whereas \\"world citizens\\" never will.line, gracile faces of the ethnicities from the Horn of Africa.

B00005K2UF|5.0|The New York Voices really know how to swing. This CD really shows it. The arrangements are absolutely fabulous. The tight crisp four-part harmony of the singers cut through the dynamite big band brass parts. We hear a very careful attention to nuance in the voices. Every little inflection, slide, and chord has been carefully fine-tuned giving the NY Voices the ultimate ensemble persona. Everything the group does together is completly synchronized. The album has incredible shape, starting off with an explosion of the vocalise of \\"Sing Sing Sing\\" and closing with the sultry, velvety chords of the a cappella \\"I'll Be Seeing You.\\" Other stand out tracks include the trucking shuffle chart \\"Smack Dab In The Middle,\\" the hillarious \\"Ain't Nobody Here But Us Chickens,\\" the cool, laid back \\"Bli Blip,\\" and the Duke Ellington Standard \\"In A Mellow Tone\\" in which bass vocalist Peter Eldridge's smooth frothy voice takes the lead and executes an amazing vocalized transcribe solo (on LYRICS, not scat syllables.) Tenor Darmon Meader not only does some incredible vocal improvisation, but also exhibits his chops on the saxophone as well (which are just as good as his vocal solos.) This is truly some of the best vocal jazz around. This album is straight up big band jazz nirvana. Essential for the lover of jazz.
B000050FEN|5.0|This chilling bit of film noir features almost unimaginable cruelty, graphically expressed.  What separates it from movies where blood flows like beer at a frat party is that the violence is never gratuitous, it is at the very center of the story, informing both character and plot.  Se7en is defined by superb art direction and an extremely intelligent script.  The overwhelming sense of dread and impending doom are reinforced with every carefully managed detail - the murder scenes in particular are so meticulously realized they resemble paintings.  The script sends characters, and viewers, scampering to the library in an attempt to understand the murderer's mind.  The bible, Milton, Chaucer, and Dante all contribute significant plot points - this is a film that talks up to its audience.<br /><br />The full weight of this fleur du mal rests on the capable shoulders of Morgan Freeman, one of America's greatest actors.  His wise, world weary, and patient performance fully embodies the sense of hopelessness experienced by those who understand evil and cannot defeat it; brilliant.  Gwyneth Paltrow is deceptively effective, her fragile beauty and innocence are there to remind us that, unlike the early victims who courted their fates by wallowing in sin, true evil inevitably destroys the guiltless as well.  R. Lee Ermey, the Police Captain, unforgettable as the drill sergeant in Full Metal Jacket, is visibly playing the role rather than being the character - he is ham-fisted at best.<br /><br />But the real tragedy here, deadly sin number eight, is Brad Pitt.  One cannot excuse his wretched performance by saying that he is playing an idiot.  It might be more accurate to say that he lacks the technique and talent to act the part of an idiot - and simply being one is not the same thing.  Watch him again and notice his tendency to throw his hands purposelessly, as though he is trying to detach them from his arms.  (This ludicrous bit of physicality was carried to an absurd extreme in 12 Monkeys, the Terry Gilliam masterpiece.)<br /><br />Kevin Spacey, who only appears in the third act, is nothing short of stunning.  He manages the impossible challenge of making this larger than life monster real with an ease that seems effortless, an amazing achievement.  For those of you who saw the end coming, well, there's always Barton Fink.  Se7en is a brilliant descent into the dark places of the human soul - certainly worth owning.keys, the Terry Gilliam masterpiece.)

B000002OTL|5.0|No movie maker in Hollywood can be more relied on to put together a top quality soundtrack than Quentin Tarantino. Perhaps it is the fact that he hand picks his own songs rather than handing it over to someone in the music world to write a score, that makes them such a powerful part of his films. <br /> <br />What is stunning about this soundtrack, and indeed the film in general, is the coherent fusion of many diametrically opposed styles into one flowing movement. However following in the style of his films, none of these many eclectic forms ever seems out of place. Indeed it is difficult to think of any other soundtrack where 'Son of a Preacher Man', 'Jungle Boogie and 'Misirlou' could all appear and not deprive the collection of its flow. <br /> <br />One of the most interesting parts of this CD is a 16 minute interview with Tarantino himself in which he explains his process for choosing songs for his films, the conflicts he has had when choosing one song or another for certain scenes and what he likes and dislikes in the soundtracks of other films. One of the things that Tarantino believes is that choosing the right song for the right scene is about as cinematic a thing as a director can do. Having seen how this soundtrack is used in 'Pulp Fiction' it is difficult to disagree.
044651652X|3.0|All the hoopla about \\"Da Vinci Code\\" brought to mind another hyped-to-the-gills book of yesteryear. I read \\"The Bridges of Madison County\\" with high interest since everyone in the world was reading it and proclaiming it genius. Well, it's okay for a romance. At least it's short. I thought it was about as good as the movie, anyway. We're having a book sale at my library and I saw two copies of it on the table. Forgotten and unwanted. A writer's voice is short-lived.
B0001NBMBC|4.0|Slipknot started out as a rather disproportioned shock-esque metalhead group who were likely to fizzle over with over a hundred others each year.  But, like with their previous album-Iowa, their Nu Metal style prevails over their image on Vol. 3: The Subliminal Verses. <br /> <br />  The Prelude 3.0 sets the disillusioned mood of the record as you drift off into a sea of angst and relaxation...until you are immediatley sucked into the rhythmic blows of The Blister Exists, which sets the basic mood for the next and similar track, Three Nil.  The mood shifts slightly with the leading single, Duality, where the vocals become more melodic and refined.  With Opium of the People is a mix of The Blister Exists and Duality with blisteringly fast-paced vocal and guitar and a hook (\\"The only way is all the way\\").  The chorus demonstates the vocal ranges of Joey shows he is able to thrash your head in while carrying a tune.  You're given a chance to sit back and indulge in something unlike any thing else you've ever heard out of them.  Circle is purely a soft acooustic jam that changes the album's direction, and I must say this is where the album gets really good-started with \\"All my questions are answers to my sins...all my endings are waiting to begin.\\"  Vermillion is a deeply lyrical song about being in love with yourself which will mezmerize you with a hair raising vocal performance matched with creeply identical guitar and drum combination. Pulse of the Maggots and Before I Forget address Slipknot's fans and just all around awesome metal songs.  Even before I was really into Slipknot, I liked Before I Forget.  Vermillion Pt. 2 really astounded me.  It is the most beautiful vocal performance I've ever heard of a metal record. Maybe I'm just a sap for the acoustic display on every metal record these days...but Vermillion Pt. 2 is the very best song on Vol. 3.  The Nameless, I feel, is the weakest part of The Subliminal Verses...a very mediocre headbanger tune that I don'treally enjoy and can't stand to listen to from start to finish.  The Virus of Life is a song you listen to purely give you the feeling of being joyously terrified.  The vocals have been vocoded and sound as though they are going over a very lowered PA.  The lyrics are purely gruesome, but you just get so wrapped up in it, you get over what he's saying. Danger-Keep Away is a farewell which suits Slipknot very well;the song is very melodic, with no flaws except a constant ringing which can become annoying over time.   <br /> <br />  This is a must for all Slipknot fans and skaters...and metal fans...and rock fans.  People who like this will definatley have to buy Iowa as well. <br />
B000CNESU8|5.0|Perhaps an acquired taste, this prickly satire probes the touchy subjects of moral relativism and the creeping deterioration of the American soul-- represented aptly by modern cultural bellwether television info-tainment (formerly known as 'news') media-- with a sophisticated, jaded wit not seen in any film before or since. Taking equal swipes at narcissism, feminism, capitalism, commercialism, political radicalism and desperate idolatry in the context of mankind's cruel exploitation of itself, the flawless script elevates screenplay nearly to the level of literature. The many rhetorical diatribes, which some may find heavy-handed, are delivered almost as soliloquies, entertaining, and often parodic, as dramatic device, yet each containing biting truths. Lumet's direction is tight, and Holden, Finch, Duvall, Dunaway and Ned Beatty (yes, Ned) all are in top form. More poignantly human than 'Broadcast News,' as trenchant as 'A Face in the Crowd,' as iconoclastic as 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,' and funnier and more evenly paced than writer Chayefsky's previous Oscar-winning effort, 'The Hospital,' 'Network' isn't just for misanthropes and malcontents-- anyone with a grown-up, wry sense of humor and a keen concern for the fate of Western civilization is free to enjoy.  4 1/2 stars.
0553583182|5.0|This book actually doubled my income when I applied some of its techniques to increasing my wealth. I have tried things like affirmations and meditation over the years with piecemeal success in terms of manifesting improvements in my day-to-day life. But for whatever reason, when I finished this book (which was recommended to me by a psychologist friend), my life started to change in ways I had only dreamed of before. The author talks about affirmations and other techniques you've probably heard of before. But he explains why they don't normally work and how to correct the problem, adding lots of techniques of his own. His book certainly did the trick for me. I am a writer by profession, and I went from putsing along at $1500 a month to making at least $3000 a month (regularly for nine months now). The book isn't about just making money but about reprogramming your subconscious mind to bring whatever it is you desire into your life. The author claims to have actually cured himself of terminal cancer, which is how he got started in the self-help business. I highly recommend this read.
B00005JLD4|2.0|Basically, Rabbit-proof Fence is an avenue for close-minded people to pretend they are open-minded. Despite portraying itself as a defence of Aboriginal cultures, Rabbit-Proof Fence censored out all their morally confronting aspects. There was no portrayal of the arranged marriages, tribal conflict, and polygamy that had motivated the policy of removing children in the first place. So extreme was the cultural censorship that, in one scene, the ladies catch a goanna for a feed, but rather than show it being killed, there is only the sound of its death. At the end of the movie, a notice reads that no animals were harmed in the film. Presumably, the director, Phillip Noyce, felt the audience wouldn't be able to come to terms with the fact that Aborigines killed native Australian animals to sustain themselves. Even stranger than the notice that animals weren't harmed, was the issue of clothing. Noyce never depicted Aborigines in their traditional state of undress. Maybe this could be interpreted as a sign that Mr Noyce never read National Geographic as a child, so he grew up with a puritanical approach to nudity. Really, what is the point of making a movie in defence of traditional Aboriginal cultures, if you can't even bring yourself to show them, or help people understand them.  <br />The policy of removing children, and assimilating them, stemmed from an inability to come to terms with these moral confrontations. Although the story shows that assimilation was a method in the past, the way the story was told shows that denial is the method of the present.  <br />

B000EPR7NE|5.0|This soundtrack is one of the few I have ever really enjoyed. Track #13  \\"Che Valiers De Sangreal\\" is worth the price alone. I nearly had tears in my eyes during the last scene when Tom Hanks discovers the 'grails' location and this music is playing. Simply awesome!
B000BNNLN4|3.0|I'm not sure why I don't give this book a better review. There is much wonder in this novel: the narrator is immensily human, her father's patheticness endearing, and the rivalries with sister and \\"step mother\\" fabulously described. The gradual revelation of the family origins and journey from \\"Ukraina\\" to Britain are rivetting.    I am glad other Amazon reviewers appreciated it plenty. But though I found \\"Short History..\\" well-written, fun and original novel, somehow I think Lewycka still has her best book ahead of her.    I think what bugs me about the book are the sections on tractors. Perhaps they account for part its originality, or serve as a clever literary technique. However, too me, the main plots, those involving the current family situation and the flashbacks of the family history, are infinitely more powerful. I need some explanation why the book needed those tractor treatises at all.
B000002BQK|4.0|Mariah Carey's Butterfly manages to please all tastes with its range of romantic and touching melodies. Its the perfect album, a nice dance beat as a lead single (Honey) good ballads (My All & Whenever You Call) classy fillers (Fourth of July, Breakdown, Babydoll) woe-is-me type songs (Outside) and the usual remixes (the two Honey remixes).  <br />A nice production, however the good ballads stand out the most. For those two songs alone, you money is worth it.
0393061310|3.0|I'm an (unenployed) agronomist, here in Brazil.I read this book here in Brazil.The best in this book is to show, how agronomical factors decided, how history will be writen later. <br />The natural decision to put all wheat in Middle East, more the presence there of bull, pig, goat and lamb; give to the middle easterners the cradle of civilization and writing. <br />The deseases with domestic animals exterminated indians, centuries before smokeless guns be invented. <br />In other words, agronomy is history. <br />The problem of this book is to forget the fact, that not only agronomy is history.Religion and politics are so importants, as nature to the history. <br />To example, before Islam countries such as Iran, Iraq, Egipt, Algeria,etc. were among the most richest, literate and progressive parts of the world. <br />Why any of 40 most developed countries of the world, is islamic?Because religion shapes the world. <br />The same happens in politic decisions.
0380778556|3.0|As for the story itself, I found it boringly cliche. A young girl from a lower class gets swept off by a rich, enigmatic middle aged man and declare her eternal love for him in spite of his confession of murdering his first wife is stuff for teenage girls at the threshold of life. If I were her, I'd run as fast as I could out of Manderley. Had he nursed her through near death, I could see sensibility in her staying and continuing to love him. As it is, any men with wallet full of money could make a woman feel like a queen (until either his money or his desire to have her runs out). Nothing special here.<br /><br />I couldn't feel the suspense though I could picture the beauty of Manderley. Perhaps I've lived too damn long. All through the reading I kept thinking this second Mrs. de Winter is stupid and this Maxim got nothing to offer a woman. What was the reason he married his first wife? The one he gave was pure stupid.<br /><br />Read this book for the lovely writing style of the author only.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|I've been buying this album since the day it came out and I just can't believe how amazing \\"stadium arcadium\\" is... The thing is, the more you listen to it, the more you like it. Before the album came out, I was a little skeptical, because well, to be honnest I didn't especially like the first single \\"Dani Clifornia\\" which is one of the less interesting songs to my opinion. Still, I was sure there would be very good songs, but not as much exellent ones. That's simple: almost all the songs on this album are amazing and some of them are masterpieces. You can tell these four guys put a lot of passion, love and energy in it, some of the songs some fill you with joy and peacefullness and some of them make you want to cry and some of them make you want to dance , and by the way (no play on word here) the funk is still (always has been) there...  <br />Just a little advice for all those people that judge and write bad reviews vey quickly... try to give the album few other listenings, because really you're missing something, and that's too bad... for you. Like I wrote it, the more you'll listen to stadium arcadium the more you'll discover how 'rich' this album is.  <br />The Chili peppers have never sounded that much united, creating something really beautiful, just listen to John Frusciante's guitar sounds and melodies, Flea's incredible groove, Chad Smith's rythms and  Anthony..well,Anthony's singing  has never been that good and expressed as much emotions with a lot of  beauty and subtleness (there's a french expression, I don't know how to say it in English but it describes the way Anthony singing there, we say ' fleur de peau' fleur meaning flowers and peau meaning skin and it's like  this thrill or this little breeze on your skin, like a flower, something expressing a very sensitive feeling). Just listen to 'hard to concentrate' for exemple and you'll know what I mean. <br /> <br />I think there's something else  important which we doesn't give enough credit to, that is the mixing of the album which is  really mindblowing (Listen to 'We believe' with good headphones). <br /> <br />Ok, here's a list of few of the songs that are among the bests to my opinion: <br />-Turn it again (wow!) <br />-We believe (the harmony of all the musicians together, the bass/drum groove, the guitar melody with anthony's singing, the vocals) <br />-Wet sand (the ending!) <br />-She looks to me <br />-Hard to concentrate  <br />-Storm in a teacup <br />-Hey <br />And lots of others... <br /> <br />So, thank you the Chili peppers for this album... you just created one of the beautifulest pieces of music I've ever heard... <br />
B000ETQRCM|5.0|'Pearl Jam' is a fine return to form by a band that's been around since the Seattle grunge scene. This is as good a selection of songs as they've done in years. The band sounds energized and ready to rock and they deliver it in spades.<br /><br />Never ones to follow trends since the end of their grunge days they choose straight ahead hard rock on this release and what great rock it is. It's been years since they'd put out anything as consistently good as what they do on 'Pearl Jam'. If you love rock music you won't be disappointed. Easily one of the best albums of this year so far.
B000F48CD8|5.0|Hearing about the formation of The Raconteurs nearly a year ago made me an instant fan before hearing one song.  After all, it's Jack White and Brendan Benson with fellow Ohioans \\"Little Jack\\" Lawerence and Patrick Keeler of the Greenhornes.  The first two songs released, \\"Steady As She Goes\\" and \\"Store Bought Bones\\" were just awesome.  I listened to them all the way up to the release of Broken Boy Soldiers.  I'll admit, I was expecting more of a garage-band type sound, filled with wild guitar solos and jam sessions.  Instead, I got a Beatles-like vibe, and that was fine by me.  White and Benson blend vocals together masterfully, and on some tracks I can't even tell who is singing (see: Hands).  The album is short, 34 minutes short, and when I listen to it it seems like the album was over in 10 minutes, because that is how delightful it is to listen to this record.  Jack White really outshines Benson's songs, White's just on a whole different level.  \\"Broken Boy Soldiers\\" is about 3-4 quality tracks from being one of the best albums in recent memory.

B000006XSD|5.0|agree with Johnny B. Good's review \\"100%\\".  I had this on album as a teen, and loved it.  I just purchased it on CD. I did not realize it was still available.  I am so stoked!!
B00005JMXX|2.0|The Day After Tomorrow seems to be just a few years late on the disaster film gravey train.  I'm not sure if this was an attempt to revive disaster film, or if it is just the director who is stuck in a time warp.  If it is the case of the former, he isn't doing the genre any favours with this movie. <br /> <br /> <br />   The Day After Tomorrow don't seem to have any shame in doing text book disaster film plotlines.  If you've seen other disaster films, then you've definitely seen this movie before.  The plot is predictable.  We have the typical science guy who sees something wrong with the earth, check.  He goes and inform the government, but they do nothing about it, check.  He then finds out the threat is worse then even he suspected, check.  30 or 400 minutes deep into the movie we see a number of natural disasters nearly level the planets biggest cities, check.  Okay now we have a struggle for survival, as the victims try to outlive the onslaught with a lot of misadventures and incredible circumstances, check.  Rinse, repeat, etc, etc.  We have the disaster film formula for sure here. <br /> <br /> <br />  If it weren't for the acting, which IS over the top, but still subtle enough to see that they are actually taking themselves serious, I would have sworn this movie was a parody.  Disaster films haven't been a draw since 1999, and 5 years later, after the genre is sucked dry, we get The Day After Tomorrow.   I thought we were seeing the Scream of disaster movies, but apparently not.  Anyway, the special effects were awesome, which lead me to give it just one more star.  The LA tornados weren't anything below awesome.  The NY floods were cool too, but those LA tornados have to be the best, horrific, entertaining, and visually appealing disaster sequence ever.   <br /> <br /> <br />  Other than that, this movie isn't worth your time.  2 stars.

B0000029DD|5.0|Jeff Buckley is one of those artists that really reach out to anyone who ACTUALLY listens to music or is extremely SENSATIVE to music.  The first song i ever heard by him was \\"So Real\\" and is still my favorite among everything he has ever done.  I listened to this song in the dark by myself with headphones on, which is a very powerful way to listen to any music.  Not only were chills shot through my spine during the chorus, but this song even has very brash chaotic breakdown with what sounds like the buzzing of a chainsaw.  There is very few songs that i've felt so much emotion in such a broad range.  I've felt a need to write a review simply about the song, but the whole album is a masterwork.  What really got me was this.<br /><br />\\"...And I couldn't awake from the nightmare<br /><br />That sucked me in<br /><br />And pulled me under<br /><br />Pulled me under...<br /><br />Oh... That was so real\\"<br /><br />Jeff Buckley drowned on May 29th, 1997.<br /><br />RIP Jeff Buckley.
B000E1ZBH2|1.0|Absolutely NO humor. I can't be Jane Austen without her wit. This film lacked any chemistry at all between the family and that is the foundation upon which an Austen novel is built. Lizzie & Jane barely spoke, the father (played by Sutherland) was dull and lackluster. Keira Knightly's hair was absolutely ugly with those always wet-looking bangs. It was a ghastly take on Pride & Prejudice. The scenery was gratuitous, there were contrived silences that only interrupted the cadence of the plot, and there was just nothing to write home about in this film.  <br />Keira Knightly's portrayel of Lizzie Bennet was too strong, that jutting chin and too-fighting glance was all wrong for the character. Lizzie has more grace, tact, class, and love for her family. YUCK!
B000007VCM|5.0|Watching Jimmy Kimmel Live recently reminded me of this album and the Cult (They performed \\"She sells sanctuary\\" on his show about a week ago.)  In 1987, a buddy of mine had seen them backing up Billy Idol in support of the \\"Electric\\" album.  My friend couldn't stop talking about how great this band was (they apparently destroyed the set after their \\"set\\" and had a remake of Steppenwolf's \\"Born to be Wild\\"), well the next day, my friend bought \\"Electric\\" and forced me to listen, and frankly, I have been hooked ever since. <br /> <br />\\"Love\\" is a \\"modern rock\\" classic (note, I said \\"Modern\\" Rock classic, and not \\"Rock\\" classic, fans of Zepplin, the Doors, the Stones etc, need not apply to this genre of music, 'modern' rock is a space reserved for the likes of The Cure, The Smithereens, U2 (pre-\\"Joshua Tree\\"), Jesus and the Mary Chain, Siouxxe and the Banshees, etc...) in that vein, Love helped define an era of modern rock music, in fact \\"She Sells Sanctuary\\" literally powered the summer of 1985. <br /> <br />If you're looking for an album to have a serious retrospect of modern rock from the 1980's, your collection needs to start with Love.  It's a sure-fire can't miss album that still sounds fresh today...  Love rules!
B00003CWL6|5.0|Few movies match the intense reflection of our own culture in such a masterful way. Every time I've seen it I am taken by a new nuance. Truly a stellar piece of filmmaking.
B000ATZAXI|4.0|While not wholly faithful to Anne Bronte's novel of the same name, this BBC adaptation has much to commend it. Excellent cinematography, as well as strong performances by the entire cast, makes this a must see production for all lovers of period pieces.<br /><br />An intriguing widow woman of mystery, Helen Graham (Tara Fitzgerald), moves into a crumbling residence known as Wildfell Hall. There, she sets up house with her very young son. Plain spoken, independent, and seeming to lack charm, she rebuffs the initial, friendly overtures of the local townsfolk and manages to alienate most of them. Gilbert Markham (Toby Stephens), a young and handsome yeoman farmer, is not put off by her manner, however, and being smitten by her, pursues her, hoping to gain her affections. Soon, however, the townsfolk begin gossiping about her supposed assignations with a wealthy, local gentleman, Mr. Lawrence (James Purefoy), the owner of Wildfell Hall. There comes a point where even the steadfast Mr. Markham wavers in his belief in her. It is then that Mrs. Graham tells him the true nature of her relationship with Mr. Lawrence and reveals her dark past.<br /><br />Rupert Graves steals the show as Arthur Huntingdon, the charming rake who captures and seduces Helen's young, romantic heart. Once married to her, however, he reveals himself to be a brutish, dissolute, and depraved philanderer, who causes her to flee their home with their young son. The role of Huntingdon is, undoubtedly, the juiciest. The film uses the narrative contrivance of flashbacks in order to explain the events that led Helen to take the extraordinary measures that she did. It tells the viewer of the sad story that brought Helen and her son to this sorry pass. Ultimately, Helen takes the high road, when an event occurs that causes her past to collide with her present. In that decision, however, lies the key to her future.<br /><br />Toby Stephens is wonderful as the yeoman farmer, whose tender heart is captured by the beautiful Helen. Tara Fitsgerald, while indeed beautiful, plays the role of Helen a tad too harshly, which, while serving to alenate the townsfolk, serves also to alienate the viewer somewhat. Even though the flashbacks serve to explain her present manner, and the viewer sees her in happier days, Helen is still not as simpatico a character as she could or should be. Still, this is a handsome, though somewhat dark and somber production that those who love period pieces will appreciate and enjoy.e beautiful Helen.

B000819PKC|4.0|Thumping 70's/80's dance beats that, at times, drown out the vocalist, a lead singer with a distinctive delivery, and enigmatic lyrics make \\"Dynamite\\" another clone of earlier works by Jamiroquai. There is the requisite slow jam (\\"Tallulah\\") that appears midway in the 11-song set, preceded and followed by a plethora of dance tracks, and two semi-rocking tunes thrown in for good measure (\\"Feels Just Like It Should\\" and \\"Hot Tequila Brown\\") that serve to bookend the album.<br /><br />Though not a bad release, it stays too true to form and can be interchangeable to the previous three releases, of which I have them in my collection, also.<br /><br />It's time for the group to take some chances with something NEW, rather than recycled.

B000EULJLU|5.0|OK, so I've heard all the reviews so far, and they cover the spectrum.  What 10,000 Days is, is progressive.  It's a step forward for Tool, and a bold one at that.  This album showcases all their glorius musical diversity, whether it's the frantic pace of Vicarious, or the peacful tones of Wings For Marie.   <br /> <br />Like someone said before, it may just take the mood being right for you to enjoy it, but this is fast becoming my favorite album in my Tool collection.  Who wants more of the same?  Not me, and Tool continues to progress with every album.  If you're looking for Tool's next step forward, this is it.
B000FL7CAK|5.0|This show totally rocks...I love it and I love Kristen Bell - she's the cutest!
B00005JOEA|5.0|Though others have already stated that it does not follow the comic scene for scene, I think that's one of the beauties of it. As is said in the movie, and comic, \\"ideas are bulletproof.\\" The movie presents the same basica idea as the comic.  <br /> <br />I have never seen a movie in the theater twice, until V. Not only is it thought provoking, but the parallels that can be made to current political polices are frightening. <br /> <br />As someone has already said, I hope we do not need a V to save us, but my fear is that we do.
B0002S94OS|4.0|After seeing others reviews, I have a few reservations.  I never heard new american gospel, but did hear black label on napster; and it blew me away.  I was turned on to ATPB and thought that it was the most refreshing, original metal since the 80's (TNWOBHM).  Although I heard a lot of influences, the way this band carried it off was awesome!!!  Totally unique with simple but great guitar sounds (I play guitar).  Ashes of the wake, when I first heard it, was a disappointment.  However, like most great bands, a new album (CD) should make you uncomfortable.  After a couple of listens, I was hooked!  This is just a continuation of LOGs talent.      I argue with other reviewers about the production betweeen CDs.  I think that ATPB is the opitome of what a heavy metal album should be.  Blythe's vocals are essentially another musical instrument, and although I like the style, the other musicians provide the backbone of the music, and putting the vocals up front would detract from this.     The production on Ashes is definitely better for the instruments, but I fail to see the difference in Blythe's vocals.  He still sound awesome, and doesn't overpower the guitars. Having Skolnick and Poland on for solos was a treat.    I still think As the Palaces Burn is their masterpiece (So far); in the ranks of Master of Puppets, Reign in Blood, and Rust in Peace (don't think I don't know about testament, exodus, nothingface, COC, vio-lence, annihalator, celtic frost, etc.)      I just hope they continue to turn out head banging anthems, and not sell out! (Like Metallica did on their black album!)
B00003CXS4|5.0|Let me just start off by saying that this is my favorite movie of all time, and I am a 31 year old woman, and not a 14 year old boy obsessed with guns and gangsters.  I first watched this movie on a lark, curious about Madonna's new (then) boyfriend's purported directing talent.  Guy Ritchie completely blew me away with this.  Smart, slick, and stylish, this movie is absolutely amazing.  Everything about this movie delivers.  The fast paced storyline, the amazing ensemble cast, the great soundtrack, and the didn't-quite-see-that-coming ending all amount to an incredibly entertaining ride.    The real stars of this movie are, of course, the stars, most of whom worked on this movie for virtually nothing.  Brad Pitt, Benicio Del Toro, Dennis Farina, Alan Ford, and the then relatively unknown Jason Statham, all bring their A-game without overpower the contributions of any of the other actors.    I would recommend watching this with both the English and Pikey subtitles the first time around.  If you love it and then wish to watch it again, you should be fine to go without the subtitles going forward.  I have probably seen this movie about 25 times and imagine many more viewings in the future.  If you like this movie, I would also recommend checking out Guy Ritchie's first feature film \\"Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels\\" which features many of the same British actors as well as Sting (I think that Sting's wife, Trudie Styler, was one of the producers for \\"Snatch\\" and that both she and Sting thought that Guy and Madonna would be perfect for one another, introducing them at a dinner at their Italian villa).  \\"Lock\\" is very similar to \\"Snatch\\" but just not quite as slick or polished.    It's too bad Madonna ruined Guy.  Any talent that he has, or may have had, seems to have been crushed under to unbelievable weight of her own stardom and career.
B000EWBKM6|5.0|This was written so well, and scripted so well.  I sure am going to miss Will and Grace, Karen and Jack.  They were really good actors and still are.  I hope to see at least one of them in a drama/sitcom next season.  They just have so much power when all 4 of them are together.  But we cannot forget Rosie.  She was the show.  I just loved her.  She would be a great maid for me.  She would never get any work done because we would be laughing all the time.  This show really gave me perspective in many areas in my life.  I will never forget what the show meant...Friends and Forgiveness.  Without those 2 important things, I don't see how people can live in this life.  Will & Grace will surely be missed.  They will always be on my mind and in my heart.
B00005JNTX|1.0|which makes this one of the worst movies I have had the misfortune of viewing. Who cares if the visuals are stunning--there is barely a plot and the characters are repulsive. You just don't care about them *at all*. I couldn't even finish it. If you want stunning visuals get Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow. OK, so it isn't blessed with a great plot, but who cares--it's beautiful to look at and has way more charm. And unlike Sin City you won't get nauseated watching it.
B00005JOFQ|4.0|Upon initial viewing, I found the movie to be emotionally underwhelming. But as time passed, I couldn't get the performances out of my head, especially Ledger's. The movie is beautifully shot and memorable.
B00005JP42|4.0|The well worn conventions of the Teen Movie, as in \\"Mean Girls\\" and the detective thriller, as in \\"Chinatown\\" or more to the point David Lynch's surreal \\"Twin Peaks\\" collide in the strange yet ultimately successful \\"Brick,\\" which stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt (so very good in \\"Mysterious Skin\\") as a teenage Sam Spade with strong overtones of Dirty Harry and equally strong low tones of Holden Caulfield. Gordon-Levitt's Brendan is determined to discover why and by whom his ex-girlfriend Emily (Emile de Ravin) was murdered.<br /><br />First time director Rian Johnson exhibits a strong sense of style and an amazing finesse with his young cast: they all come off as caring, thoughtful, emotionally stable or not human beings...not gorgons or aliens as they are so often portrayed on the screen.<br /><br />Besides Brendan, the other amazing creation is Lukas Hass's take as \\"Pin\\" (as in Kingpin): a kind of Don Corleone/Superfly character who reigns over a group of young thugs. Hass and Johnson's writing for him get very close to caricature but thankfully never quite take it all the way there.<br /><br />\\"Brick\\" and Gordon-Levitt's Brendan are refreshing, daring and astringent creations and as such are not to be missed by anyone interested in contemporary American movies.
B000059PPN|3.0|The House by the Cemetery is an Italian horror movie that has all the things you'd expect in a bad movie:  cheesy special effects, bad acting and a plot that is only vaguely comprehensible.  It's the sort of movie you'd expect to see on Mystery Science Theater 3000 if not for the excessive violence.  There's all sorts of reasons to hate this movie, which makes it all the more surprising that I like it:  I suppose it fits into the \\"so-bad-it's-good\\" category. <br /> <br />The movie begins with a brief prologue involving the gruesome murder of a couple lovers in an abandoned house.  Then the story kicks in, with a family moving temporarily into the same house;  the mother has some sort of minor psychological problem, the father is obsessed with a research project and the son is crippled by an inability to act.  Oh yes, and the house is by a cemetery.  You'd think that the cemetery might explain the evil events, but actually it has almost nothing to do with the story. <br /> <br />It's hard to explain the plot, which seems made up as it goes along.  Plot lines go nowhere...there are hints that the father has been in town before, but nothing comes of it.  The babysitter seems to be somehow involved with the killings, at least until she wanders into the cellar, an underground room that the family seems to like to leave the door open to, despite the killer bats that live inside.  There is something else living in the cellar too, one of those slow-moving monsters that no one seems able to outrun.  And then there is the ending, one of those conclusions that make you just go \\"huh?\\" <br /> <br />It's hard for me to figure out the appeal of this movie, but there is something likeable about this effort, enough to merit three stars, even though, based on its flaws, it should be less.  It is pretty gory, however (even if the effects aren't very realistic), but if you like cheesy horror, this may be worth watching. <br />
B000002J1S|5.0|This is it!  This is the only album/performance that is rated with 5 stars by me.  Not only is this my favorite, but I believe it to be best collective work of musical art of all time.  No other composer or composition has come close to such a comprehensive \\"concept\\" within the constructs of a musical performance.  The story of \\"The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway\\" is a story represented in the lyrics, and is also a short descriptive story which is contained in the inner cover of this original album and in the CD.  The album disk covers contained the songs lyrics and in the booklet of the CD you can also find the lyrics.      I would highly recommend that a new listener of The Lamb that they would read the story first, then play the album (if you are so lucky to have it since the CD's, even the re-mastered, fall short in sonic quality) and read along with the lyrics.  Do this once or twice so that your familiar with the story line then you're ready to really listen to the performance in a musical perspective as well as in a sonic engineering perspective.  You'll find the emotions of the story are expressed exquisitely music and voice as well as the sonic engineering.  I also recommend listening to this in the dark (sensory deprivation) to help open the sonic imaging to the visual dependant.  This helps you focus on the auditory senses and not rely upon the visual senses.  One part among the many that I love is when the windshield hits the hovering fly, as well as all the ambient sounds utilized here.      I saw this concert in 1974 and this was by far the most impressive concert I ever attended.  As the story says this all happens in the blink of an eye, it's about life, it's about death.  The very last song It has a line that says \\"It's Only Knock And Know All, But I Like It\\", this is a play on the Rolling Stones line \\"it's only Rock and Roll but I like it\\".  The band tied all the songs together making their transition transparent, and used the theme established in thefirst song (the title song) progression throughout the album in different variations, just like Classical Composers.  This may take a few times listening to to begin to understand and appreciate what Genesis did here on vinyl.      Though Peter wrote the concept and arrangements all members contributed to its creation.  Genesis was such an awesome band that they never did solo's within their music; each instrument was a medium in expressing their \\"Art\\".  The keys, drums, guitars, and all instruments captured the essence.  This showed their depth and talent without self-absorbed solos which were common in those days.  The genius behind the synthesizer was Brian Eno, on the album Peter called it Enofication.  David Hutchins also deserves credit for the quality engineering.  I can understand why a few don't get it (concerning \\"The Lamb\\") due to the conversion from analog to digital, because nothing matches the quality of the original 200Gram Vinyl, which is still available today.      There are many other great works, but all are pale in comparison to The Lamb.    Many fellow musicians and music lovers consider this album with the same regard as I, and considered it prophetic.  \\"The Grand Parade Of Lifeless Packaging\\" song is about cloning before cloning was even close to a reality, and The Colony Of Slippermen (A Visit To The Doktor) is about genetic alterations (removing human emotions (like a dogs tail)).      I am still waiting for someone to make a movie of \\"The Lamb\\".  I've seen excellent quality footage of this concert in a documentary of Genesis and I can't understand why this has not been released on DVD yet along with all the other excellent concerts of the 60's, ,& 70's that were either on Don Kirschner's Rock Concert, King Biscuit, and etc..       By the way things are going; it will be generations before anything will out do what was done on The Lamb.  Make sure you get this in Vinyl and try to avoid retailers like Music Direct, I would recommend AcoustincSounds inc..     You will find those who won't get it, because they may be to focused on the micro.  This is a whole package experience from sound stage, to musicianship, to content, to engineering, to emotional expression in voice, instrument, and context.  Enjoy, you'll get it!
0062502182|3.0|Alchemical ideas, by association with most similar philosophies, are essentially Hindu mysticism (cosmic idealism); Coelho takes an esoteric Catholic view of this belief system and translates it into a theology of following personal destiny. The story is told simply in a format readable by children, and reveals much in its asides and the metaphors of its characters, but if it has a failing it is that it focuses too much on the individual and too little on the process of nature and thought as a whole. However, for an introduction it is an excellent, easy read that is fun and family-friendly.
0764574124|5.0|Plenty of fellow office workers have all come upon the same plight I did not too long ago.  We're going along with our busy non-programming related work when all of a sudden *bam!* the boss decides we are the perfect candidates to either implement a new software solution or simplify/refine an existing one.  I'd dabbled in C++ and Liberty Basic for my own personal use before, but had absolutely no experience whatsoever working in Visual Basic for Applications, and no knowledge of how to make all the different components of the Microsoft Office suite work in tandem.  \\"Excel VBA Programming for Dummies\\" entered stage left, and completely saved me from bringing down the whole play.<br /><br />Someone with absolutely no programming experience at all could pick this book up and be pumping out simple VBA applications within a day.  The whole thing is very user friendly, and includes a lot of tips that individuals new to VBA or the office suite won't think to check.  The first chapter briefly describes exactly what VBA is, how it interacts with the office suite, and then gives an overview of the different versions of Excel and how they differ.  From chapter two onward it's all VBA, progressively adding on new concepts to move the reader upward towards VBA mastery.  As this is a \\"For Dummies\\" book, all the basic information such as code syntax and the various dialog boxes are presented in detail, providing a firm foundation for the user to expand on in his own experimentation and further study.  A few tidbits of more advanced information, pertaining to the most frequently needed solutions, are presented throughout the book.  For example, towards the end the author clearly explains how to use VBA to open up a blank e-mail and populate it with information from an Excel spreadsheet, as this is a rather commonly needed use for VBA, but it does require a little extra knowledge beyond the absolute basics.  My only real complaint about this book would be that it never adequately explains when VBA should be used versus when normal Excel forumulas would suffice, or most importantly, when a good combination of the two are called for.  As the focus of the book is on teaching VBA basics however, this can be overlooked.<br /><br />Anyone needing to learn the basics of VBA quickly but lacking a teacher to explain everything should do themselves the favor of picking Excel VBA Programming for Dummies.  If you need info beyond the basics, and want to take your skills to the next level, move on to \\"Professional Excel Development : The Definitive Guide to Developing Applications Using Microsoft Excel and VBA\\" after mastering the info presented in this book.hen VBA should be used versus when normal Excel forumulas would suffice, or most importantly, when a good combination of the two are called for.

0140868445|5.0|The Grapes of Wrath truly is the Great American Novel.  From the Dust Bowl of Oklahoma to the grim and cruel lives faced by migrant workers in California, the story captures the heartache of the Great Depresssion and the power and redemption of the human spirit.  Steinbeck captures the spirit of the times perfectly through his compelling characters.  This is as good as it gets.<br /><br />I listened to the unabridged audio edition, and it is fabulous.  The narrator is extraordinarily talented and completely captures the spirit of this classic.  His dialogue is perfect.<br /><br />If I have one complaint, it is that the primary hero of the story simply drifts off in a bit of an anticlimax.  But that's probably necessary to the overall plot.  Taken as a whole, the story is the most moving and inspirational work of fiction I've ever read or heard.
B000002UE2|5.0|This, together with Grand Funk Live, is one of the best live albums of the 70's.  Really captures the excitement and *you are there* elan of guitar rock before punk crashed the party. Ranks up there with Frampton Comes Alive and Song Remains the Same, though with less improvisation.  Should be in every rock enthusiast's collection. A real slice of time when rock was still loyal to it's roots in the blues.  The playing is inspired and sung with complete conviction.  Will send you back to a simpler place and time. Grand Funk Live is a better album, but the recording is better this time out.
B0007Y08QA|5.0|The many reviews for this film make it unnecessary for me to detail the film's plot. One is struck, in watching \\"The Machinist\\", by what separates sanity from madness, what is real and what is unreal, and by the tenuous curtain that separates guilt from perpetrator.<br /><br />The mood of the film is dark; it has a texture like bitter sandpaper and oil-stained steel. The dialogue is in turns brusque and tender, and the relationships within the film are never static. When speaking with his prostitute girlfriend who sees Trevor (the character played by Christian Bale) as her way out of a life she is desperate to escape, Trevor is surprisingly malleable and almost tender. With his workmates, he is increasingly confused, suspicious, terrified. With the mysterious figure that no one but he can see, he is insistent, somehow aware that this man knows why he has not slept in over a year, why strange things are happening, what is happening...<br /><br />It's a tour de force of a performance. Many reviewers have already commented on the way in which Christian Bale starved himself to become skeletally thin to play this role. I've never seen anything like it - one is terrified for the health of Trevor, drawn into his awful sleepless suffering, not least because he looks like a man who's reaching the end of the road.<br /><br />The ending is indeed a shocker, a surprise that can scarcely be anticipated. It is the perfect, the most satisfying, ending I've seen in quite a while. The directing led the pace of the film in a remorseless ride through the symbols that tell us what is truly happening.<br /><br />Unequivocally recommended for those who don't mind a dark film, superbly plotted.
0385336691|5.0|First, I admit I am a true fan of Lee Child and his Jack Reacher series.... I've even read the short story with Reacher in it.  It is not his best but it's still worthy of reading... and I'm sure I'll read it again before the next book in the series is released.<br /><br />Jack Reacher is still a flawed but honorable man..... I didn't quite get the constant references to 'Mirror on a stick' and thought the book might have been better without them....and I was disappointed that the other 9.5 million dollars wasn't retrieved for use in reparations....<br /><br />I wish we didn't have to wait so long between books... I'm anxious now for the next episode...
B00009RAJH|5.0|People- if you have been following my reviews closely (which I'm sure you haven't) you would know poor Metamorpho's life was careening out of control. But, this is what one gets by being free enough to write anything they want in any given manner, at any given moment, on any given day.  I see that some of you are not fully appreciative of my reflections. That is o.k. What was I expecting? Perfection? From the human race? You all knew I was a loving soul but taking advantage of my naivity is not nice people. Not nice at all. But Metamorpho does not hold grudges and desires to still review worthy music for all of you. And, in an attempt to simplify, have I got worthy music for you!<br /><br />This time out, we have the excellent first album by the new, revamped Fleetwood Mac (with the inclusion of Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks) in the self titled album released in 1975. It has always boggled my mind why their next album \\"Rumours\\" was so mega while this gem was virtually overlooked. In many was it was the precursor to the emotions expressed in that album, and in my opinion, just as valid. Sadly, I have no control over what the masses decide.  Choose your own examples.<br /><br />But as pop-rock classics go this is one gem of an album. Many, many songs about the tangled web we weave in love relationships. And indecision rears it's laughing face at even single turn. In \\"Monday Morning\\" we have Lindsey Buckingham bemoaning the fact that his love is very inconsistent. He remains focused while she remains not sure. He \\"can't go on believing for long\\" which reflects the tiring of the situation. The music is cleverly written in a stop and go manner.  \\"Warm Ways\\" by Christine McVey is a gentle, soothing love song embellished by a tender moment. But give her time.  The trembling within the ground will start to appear. \\"Blue Letter\\" is a jaunty song by Lindsey. However, this time, he has tired of the situation started in the first song and he \\"won't be waiting around\\" for it to change.<br /><br />We next come to the ethereal realm of Stevie Nicks with \\"Rhiannon\\". It is evident that she cannot be tied down to be anyone's consistent lover. One minute she is like a cat, and then the other minute she's like a bird. She is a complex creature that can't decide on one mind. Written basically in one chord- the band does an excellent job embellishing this with texture. \\"Crystal\\" is an amazing song due to it's wave-like movement as Lindsey realizes he has been immersed by his love which drives him for a clensing to the sea. Alternately, he is being engulfed by it as well.<br /><br />\\"Over My Head\\" by Christine is a sprightly pop tune filled with paradoxes. She realizes her relationship is filled with trade-offs which are disturbing. On the one hand she is thrilled by the tender moments but they come at the price of her lover being cold and hurting her pride. A very uncomfortable situation. This theme is also revisited in her other song \\"Say You Love Me\\".  Christine is an expert in writing infectious, easy groove pop tunes. We then come to \\"Landslide\\" which I think is the ultimate gem on this album. Stevie Nicks is soul-searching, trying to make sense of all her intricate feelings.  Just when she thinks she has finally found herself by seeing her reflection in the snow, it is swept away by a landslide, forcing her to search again. Love the acoustic guitar. Love the lilting melody. It is majestic and perfectly reflects our own quests of who we are and how we fit into the world.<br /><br />\\"World Turning\\" is about how the outside world imposes it's judgements and how we, although questioning it's wisdom, just need someone to make us face another day. Lindsey gives us a nice twangy guitar riff juxtaposed against a frazzled state of mind. \\"Sugar Daddy\\" is about Christine's need for a true lover and someone with money to take care of her. It is clear she would like one person to be all this - however, in her mind, they have become seperate.<br /><br/>Finally, \\"I'm So Afraid\\" is the heart of darkness that Lindsey must confront in his search for love. Our fears, it seems, not only lie in outside reality, but within ourselves as well. It is cleverly written in the pattern of a heartbeat. What I find most amazing about good music is that both the lyrics and the music work in sych to convey a mood. It is a magic that is such a joy to creative minds.<br /><br />In closing, all the seeds of emotions planted here came to fruition with \\"Rumours\\". In my mind, it is definitely just as excellent. I think what it had going against it was the fact that it went more pop as opposed to previous Fleetwood Mac albums. Coupled with the fact that the previous fan base may have resented this and alot of people had not yet caught on to the new sound. In any event, if you enjoyed \\"Rumours\\" then this album is an essential counterpart and should definitely be included in your collection.<br /><br />Well I did it people. I wrote a review without Metamorpho's excessive ego running wild. (Yeah, right). I will be back again, I am sure, to bring you more worthy music. Until then, may the glow from all the lightbulbs in your mind shine bright and strong, guiding all of you through the darkness. Stay well my people.

0425156842|4.0|Sophie's World is written by Norwegian writer and a philosophical teacher, Jostein Gaardner. This book is subtitled \\"A Novel about the History of Philosophy,\\" and in it Gaarder talks about 2000 years worth of western philosophical thought. I believe this is one of the most enthralling and catching book there is, for those of you who're very interested in history of philosophy. I had a great time reading this book. It is fun, very interesting and the author does a great job of explaining the theories of famous philosophers. The author also does a very fascinating job of taking complicated ideas and presenting them in language comprehensible to young adults such as teenagers. Although the overall plot was very confusing, Sophie's World is great for those who are new to philosophy.  <br />  This book is written in the style of novel, and the lead character is a 14-year-old girl named Sophie Amundsen who gets introduced to a history of philosophy by a mysterious person. One day, after walking home from school, she is going through her mailbox and finds a letter by a stranger with only her name and her address on it. How weird is this? She opens it and on the letter inside read \\"Who are you?\\" and \\"Where does world come from?\\" Sophie has many good ideas and thoughts to these questions but really have no idea how to answer them. As Sophie tries to have a philosophical discussion with her mom, it merely leads to her mother believing she has gone insane. <br /> Everyday, a letter comes to her mailbox that contains a few questions and later in the day, package of letter comes explaining/describing the ideas of a philosopher who dealt with the issues. At their very first lesson, Albert tells Sophie that philosophy is very reasonable to life and if we don't question our living, then we are not really living. After that being said, he proceeds to western philosophy. Alberto teaches Sophie the ancient myths, and natural philosophers who were concerned with change. He then movesonto Democritus and the theory of atoms. Sophie is amazed by the fact that Democritus managed to use the philosophers before him to come up with a new theory. Furthermore, Sophie is introduced to early century's psychologists, rationalists, philosophers with their different beliefs. (Such as Descartes, Spinoza, Locke, and eventually Freud and Darwin's philosophical theory.) Meanwhile, Sophie's mother finds one of the letters. Since it has no stamp, she thinks it's a love letter and begins to meddle and question her. <br /> Sophie finds that everything she learns seems to make sense to her, and begins to appreciate the philosophy that's being followed. In fact, in a literal sense philosophy becomes a regular part of Sophie's life, since the course that she is now taking makes up a major part of her day. As the lessons continue, Sophie's mind becomes extremely sharp and she eventually incorporates all the things she has learned from her teacher named Albert, (she eventually figures out that the strange philosopher's name was Albert Knox) into coming up with interesting philosophical theories of her own, and questioning and challenging her own teacher Albert. In addition, as time progresses, Sophie's mom notices a big change in Sophie and becomes quite impressed with her ideas and thoughts, <br /> Gaarder forces us to consider more deeply the implications of philosophy that Sophie learns. Gaarder seems to be showing us that philosophy is part of everyday life, and those philosophers of the past will always reasonable to the present. Reading Sophie's World makes us think about philosophy and makes us consider some of the most important questions that can be asked.  <br /> This is a great book. You don't need philosophical textbooks to learn all these stuff. This book saves lots of money compared to philosophical textbooks and everything is summarized effectively. They are much smaller than textbooks too. If you're alarmed by 544 pages, don't be. Each chapter is filled with appealing facts from the past, and they're very interesting. Well, I don't know how else I could depict, but this was an amazing book for me. It was lot better than reading textbooks. Take a risk, and try reading it yourself.  <br />
0440237688|5.0|This is an amazing book.  It delves into a fictional approach of the deep meaning behind pain and suffering in a world without the opportunity to make choices freely.  Read it and think about it.
0385336691|5.0|Lee Child has gotten back in his taut style with the latest Jack Reacher book, The Hard Way - If you have never read one of the Reacher books, this is a good way to get hooked - Reacher, ex-military, literally lives off the grid - goes place to place with the clothes on his back and the necessities in his pocket- He still has his excellent reputation going for him as a tough, no-nonsense man, who has a tremendous sense of honor, albeit his own brand. This book deals with a supposed kidnapping of a wife and daughter, and Reacher being in the right time and place to see the vehicle where the ransom money was dropped. He's brought into the search after he gives the car's description to one of the search team. Soon he has his own theories and with the help of (of course) a beautiful older lady investigator, he sets about to see what is really going on.<br /><br />The phrase on the title review is one of Reacher's favorite sayings - That's for Da-n sure! - When you get it the hard way, the right way, you will be saying 'that's for darn sure' the way to write a book!
B0007XT87G|5.0|Yet once again this band has dazzled me with their brilliance! I'm glad I waited a while to review this, because at first I didn't THINK I liked it as well as In Absentia. But it didn't take long for all these numbers to get their hooks in me. I love the way Steven Wilson bares his soul on the songs he writes, something that is almost non- existent in this modern-day, mass- manufactured songwriting world. It's like an invitation into his private experiences and I, for one, am glad I accepted. It's easy to see that Steven is an eclectic music fan. I hear so many different influences here: Led Zep, King Crimson (which is further enhanced by a guest appearance by Adrian Belew,) Radiohead, et all... But the thing I like with this recording is that it is another evolutional step from the last, and that's what I define as \\"progressive.\\" There are moments of their \\"Floyd- era\\" period interspersed with high- voltage rock which really works for me. It's hard to understand how songs with mainly melancholic lyrics can always seem to lift my spirits. Am I \\"growing stranger by the minute?\\" This is a MUST HAVE!
0792846443|3.0|The problem in making a movie from a book like Misery is that the fans of the book have our own ideas as to what Annie Wilkes would look like, sound like and act like. They could never cast an actress that would compete with the character that we have all envisioned when reading King's book. Kathy Bates did a phenomenal job of portraying this character, but she just can't frighten me like the Annie Wilkes that I envisioned while reading King's novel.  <br />Overall, this is a movie worth seeing, but I think that people who never read the book will enjoy the movie a bit more.
B000DZIGDU|3.0|Lets face it You cant go into the cinema anymore and find a movie worth the 10 bucks you just spent. Jarhead is another example of where the trailer is 10 times better than the film. I did walk out of this movie and I never usually do, but this was a real snooze fest. The fact that this director made American Beauty is amazing. What Jarheads did do well was kind of show what it feels like inside your head during war, but just watch your copy of Apocolypse Now again if you wanna see that. It also had some pretty good cinematography. Anyway so far after American Beauty Sam Mendes is a whopping 0 for 2 with Road To Perdition and Jarhead.
0385336691|1.0|I love to see a tough guy in action who can out-smart the bad guys and get the girl in the midst of it all but this is absolutely ridiculous.  I have read the other reviews and thought I was maybe reading the wrong book. The lack of action and mindnumbing descriptions of various armed forces tactics is sophmorish at best.  If read at all, save this one for the most desperite of times.
0553213105|5.0|I absolutley loved this book and had to keep reminding myself it was written ages ago. Apart from the dialogue, which was sometimes hard to understand, the story is timeless. Each character in this book was well developed and interesting. The twists and turns of the novel were well planned and thought out to keep the reader wanting more. I loved the setting of this book and Jane Austen's descriptions made you feel that you were there with them. This book is witty, charming, emotional and endearing. There is only one thing I didn't like about it...there wasn't a sequel. I recommend this book to anyone who's interested in a classic and a true romance.<br /><br />Bravo Jane Austen!!!
B000EMGAGW|3.0|Mobb Deep, a rap duo from Queensbridge, released their first album under G-Unit this year, entitled \\"Blood Money\\". Mobb Deep (Havoc and Prodigy) have dropped some gems in their career, like the classic albums \\"Infamous\\", \\"Hell on Earth\\", and \\"Murda Muzik\\". M.O.B.B. always brought the gutter street rhymes that Hip-Hop heads loved, but later in their career it seems like they have fallen off a bit. With \\"Blood Money\\", they produce some mixed results.<br /><br />The album starts off with \\"Smoke It\\". The beat on this is good but it's not a track you'll listen to every time you play the album. The next track is their 1st single, \\"Put Em In Their Place\\", produced by Sha Money XL and Havoc. It's one of the better tracks, the beat is nice and the verses are OK but the hook is kinda weak and I don't think it'll get any hype. \\"Stole Something\\", produced by Havoc, has a nice beat and the verses and chorus are decent; this is far from the worst track on the album, but not the best either. I don't really like the beat on \\"Creep\\", but the verses are good, even though the hook is rather mediocre. \\"Speakin So Freely\\" is probably my favorite track on here. P, Havoc and Banks all drop nice verses and the chorus is nice. \\"Click Click\\" is decent at the most, Tony Yayo drops a forgetable verse but I like the hook. It's good for atleast a few listens. \\"Pearly Gates\\" is another standout track. 50 drops a so-so hook but I like the sample on the beat and most people complain about the lyrics by P which bashes God and religion (Interscope actually edited some of his lyrics, if you download the song you'll be able to hear the explicit version), but me myself being an atheist I don't mind what he says and I don't care about religion either so it's all good. Pearly Gates is one of the best tracks on the album. \\"Daydreamin\\" is a somewhat darker track about growing up wishing to be in the rap game. I really like the beat and the chorus to this track. \\"Infamous\\" is the only Alchemist produced track. It's better than most songs on here but it doesn't appeal to me as much as Pearly Gates or Speakin So Freely. \\"Outta Control Remix\\", which the original joint appeared on the Massacre, is actually a 50 Cent track featuring Mobb Deep. I really like the laid-back feel to the song and I have to say 50 came correct with this track. I still don't like him and I still think most of his music is crappy but this is a rather enjoyable cut. I also love the beat on this one.<br /><br />\\"Backstage Pass\\" qualifies for the worst track on the album. As other reviewers have stated, Mobb Deep have no business making a track about women and groupies; it doesn't fit their style at all. \\"Give It To Me Baby\\" is also downright skip material. These two tracks, which are back to back on the album, are definitely the worst songs. \\"In Love With the Moulah\\" is another skippable song. They talk to money like it's a woman, and besides there are way too many times on this album where they mention something about money and it gets old really quick. \\"It's Alright\\" featuring Mary J. Blige is an ok cut but it's yet another track with 50 on it and as I've already mentioned I hate 50 Cent. \\"Capital P Capital H\\" has some very bad lyricism by Prodigy, (and when I say bad that's what I mean) and the album could've done without this track. \\"Have a Party\\" with Nate Dogg is just another average party cut already on the Get Rich or Die Trying soundtrack.<br /><br />As many other reviewers have stated, Prodigy has sort of fallen off with his lyrics. Both P and Havoc had dropped some great tracks in their careers, but it seems like now, signing with 50 Cent and G-Unit, they don't really care about the quality of their tracks, just about making money. I mean, not all the tracks are bad, and this album isn't as bad as some people are making it out to be. Just because it's released under G-Unit and 50 is all over it doesn't automatically make it bad. BUT, it could've been much better. Tracks like Speakin So Freely and Pearly Gates are great, but tracks like Backstage Pass and Give It to Me Baby are horrendous. This album may appeal to new fans of Mobb Deep and fans of G-Unit, but Mobb fans who's been around since their start will not like it. I think it's more like a mixed bag; it has good tracks and it has bad tracks. Nothing outstanding though, and it doesn't deserve anything more than 3 stars. Some of the hooks are weak and their attempts at making commercial tracks fail badly. To consider this duo \\"sell-outs\\" is your decision.n So Freely and Pearly Gates are great, but tracks like Backstage Pass and Give It to Me Baby are horrendous.

B000ETRCMQ|2.0|One star for Felicity Huffman's remarkable performance (the whole cast is good, actually), plus another star for tackling a sensitive subject in a sensitive way. <br /> <br />The script is ho-hum, though, and far from edgie. It's all a bit too \\"Wong Foo\\", if you know what I mean. If you need to pat yourself on the back for being open-minded, then this is the film for you. Me, I'll be rewatching _Hedwig and the Angry Inch_ for the umpteenth time.
B000002WYT|2.0|Why is it that this band is so highly praised?  Why, why, why?  Why are people so obsessed with Dave Matthews?  What is it about this guy that's so fascinating, so original, so godly?  Do you people really listen to this music, or do you just fall in love with its catchiness, its mellowness, the lame easiness of Dave's voice and the fun, folky, teenyboping garbage that is this music?  The lyrics are boring, unoriginal, and Dave's voice is just about as good as any other generic male singer that you hear on the radio or MTV.  The music has that same typical, poppy, mediocore sound that people try to pass of as impassioned, acoustical bliss, when really it lacks any sort of creativity or edge.  This music is mediocore at best.  I give this album 2 (more like 1.5) stars for being slightly less lame and slightly more edgy than his other crappy albums.  I give the band -5 stars for being uninventive, sell-out mediocrity.  And that goes for bands like Phish, Blue's Traveler's and Sister Hazel too (who are all actually better than DMB).  If you're a girl it's one thing to listen to that, but guys...c'mon.  If you need a stoner/mellow \\"rock\\" fix, look to O.A.R., Fastball, and Dispatch.  At least those bands have some passion and creativity.
B000EULJLU|1.0|What is a song without a song or an album without a sound?  This last tool album has confirmed all my fears about the transition my former favorite band has gone through.  As Maynard may have reached the pinnacle of his spiritual development, the music has become so reclusive that it can be considered to be nothing but the most impotent of attempts.  Find a website that shares the sound of the new album?  If it exists it is in the shadow, as is this insignificant release.  This complaint is not about music, but marketing and disconnection from roots.  I weep for my heroes, which have reemerged after so many years as holier than thou.  Musicians have no right to control their audience and Tool is no exception.  True enlightenment is not reserved for the shadows.  Just ask Gandhi, King and Muhammad.  (summary for newer tool fans) i didn't like the last album and don't want to buy the new one without a sample.  the fact that there is nothing available online is certainly the result of a bull___ attitude by the artist.  ps-maynard get over yourself.

0385486804|5.0|This book is a bit slower than Krakauer's other.  And the main character is not likeable.  It's just tough to sympathize with a middle class kid who does a really stupid thing.  The book would probably be better if you didn't know the ending going into it.  Of course, Krakauer is a wonderful writer and his books are always entertaining.
B00007E8V4|5.0|I don't get why people do not absolutely love this album, even if its \\"suppossed to be their trash from other albums.\\" Everything about it seems to fit perfect, the lyrics, the guitar, the bass, the drums, and the vocals were all at their peak. There were very few songs that weren't strong, but thats true of any album. In terms of overall musical quality (not recording quality) this was by far the best album they have put out, not that the others aren't good. Anyways, here what I thought of the tracks:  <br /> <br />1. Chic N Stu- I personally don't like it. It shows that they didn't even care about this album that they put it first. It may have a serious message, but its lyrics are just strange, usually SOAD songs like this are catchy, but this one isn't really that catchy.  5/10 <br />2. Innervision- Great track. This would have made a amazingly popular single if they put it on Toxicity. It is just a quality song all around. 10/10 <br />3. Bubbles- Not my favorite, but its still a quality song. 7/10 <br />4. Boom!- The two verses are freaking amazing! The vocals are great and everthing else fits in perfectly. Its political, and different than most SOAD songs. 10/10 <br />5. Nuguns- Its so catchy. Its just hard to turn off. 9/10 <br />6. ADD- Another incredibly song. Its really solid. 10/10 <br />7. Mr Jack- If you can get through the long intro, its another great song. It has a slower, deeper feel than most. 10/10  <br />8. A-E-I-E-I-O- Its a strange song that only SOAD could pull off. The lyrics are really strange at certain points, but thats to be expected with SOAD. 10/10  <br />9. 36- Pointless. Its the only one that I skip through. 1/10 <br />10. Pictures- Its alright. Its pretty repetative. 6/10 <br />11. Highway Song- Nothing repetative about this song. It is the best SOAD song ever written! No two parts of this song sound the same. Its an amazing combination of muscial talent. 11/10 <br />12. *uck the System- Not great, its one of those that I can tell whythey didn't put it on a real album. 5/10 <br />13. Egobrain- Slow and beautiful all around. The vocals are great and the guitar work is excellent. Its powerful. 10/10 <br />14. Thetaways- I personally love this song, but I can see why some might not. Its really fast. Its kinda repetative, but what they repeat is worth hearing a few times. The lyrics and message in general may be hard to follow, but its such a good song. 10/10 <br />15. Roulette- They slow it down here, really slow. Its a breath-taking song. It really shows that they can branch out into other non-system genres and still sound amazing. This song really shows how musically talented they are. 10/10 <br />16. Streamline- Another powerful SOAD track. It would have made a great single on Toxicity. Probably one of their best tracks ever.  Its a great way to end a great album. I just wish the 25 second guitar solo near the end would just keep going forever. 11/10
0875428940|5.0|This deck is expressively drawn and very intuitive.  Anyone comfortable with the \\"standard\\" Rider Waite would adapt easily to this one, Pagan or otherwise.  I find the expressions and stances of the people on these cards, as well as the vibrant colors, THE EASIEST to read of any deck.  Also, there are so many small details in these cards which could be read so many different ways.  The backs are a striking Celtic knot, which is fully reversable.<br /><br />My favorite aspect of these cards is the court cards, which are beatifully drawn.  I have always had the most trouble with the court cards.  This court absolutely COMES ALIVE for me, as do all the cards in this deck.  From the strong jawline of the Queen of Swords, to the gentle King of Cups, the \\"nothing gets by me\\" stance of the King of Swords, and the abundance obvious in the face of the King of Pentacles, each card reflects its own suit so accurately, yet completely retains its own individuality.<br /><br />This deck would be easy for the beginner to interpret, yet has the intricacy, complexity, and staying power for the more experienced.

B0001GMIOE|5.0|My original Canon battery that came with the camera has a distressing habit of dying after ~250 pictures (I have a 1 GB memory card that can take many more), so I had to figure out a way of charging it whereever I went. I had thought that a non-Canon battery, almost by definition, would be worse than the original. But, no - this one is great. It lasts longer - I havent formally tested it to see how long it lasts, but it lasted for >320 pictures on one occasion, so is clearly better. Carrying this is better than carrying a charger with you on long trips.
B000E97Y6K|3.0|This movie had the potential to be an excellent movie.  It updated the old King Kong with all the modern film-making techniques.  The camera work, the special effects, etc. were all brilliant.  The acting was easily above par.  Someone, however, in production, needed to edit out some things.  Most of the too-long movie was made up of scenes of King King running around, etc.  Almost every scene was just too long.  The movie-makers need to learn to get the plot moving, and cut out the rest, especially when a movie like that is going for so long.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|Ever since the Japanese version of Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children was released, many Americans have awaited the arrival of the movie in America. It is now here, and I am the first one to review it.    (Since just about everyone else has already explained the plot, you will have to read some of the other reviews on this site if you are unsure of what I'm talking about.)     Many fans of the original Japanese version are wondering if the English dub is worth it, and I'm here to say that it is. If you are a fan of cartoons and English-dub anime, the cast is quite easy to recognize. Steve Staley, Fred Tatasciore, and Dave Wittenburg do the English voices of Kadaj, Loz, and Yazoo (respectively), and Steve Burton, the English voice of Cloud in the Kingdom Hearts games, provides his voice to the hero once again. The only problem that anyone will see in the dub is that since the original animation was done in Japanese, the words don't perfectly match what the characters say in English. Other than the English dubbing, the original version of the movie is untouched.     Because of its 2-Disc format, there is a good amount of special features on this DVD: trailers for the movie and future FF7 games, a Japanese making-of documentary, the Venice Film Festival preview version, a \\"Reminiscence of FF7\\" feature showing the main events from the original game, and a quick batch of deleted scenes.     The plot is pretty cool, the animation is awe-inspiring, and the music is perfect. If you are a Final Fantasy VII fan, you should definitely get this DVD and the official soundtrack.
B00006EXL5|1.0|i can't believe that they got a major label deal based on this album. if you want some GOOD mcr check out three cheers for sweet revenge. that's a good album. don't get me wrong. i love this band. but this is just crap. there are no melodys...it sounds like it was recorded in  one of the band member's bathrooms..and it's just heavy guitars and screaming about vampires and other hogwosh. skip this detour. i can't believe i bought this album hoping it would grow on me. it hasn't.
0316172324|2.0|I confess, I was disappointed.<br /><br />Gladwell is one of a current generation of authors who wears his learning light with the benefit of a hip, punchy tone. He identifies a marketable idea and uses it to hang his various, jumble bag of ideas on. In Blink, the key is 'thin slicing' - in other words, the practice of judging a book by its cover.<br /><br />Does Gladwell think this is a good idea or not? At first, it seems yes. He kicks off with the story of the Kouros statue in the Getty Museum that an art expert was able to identify instantly as a fake, overriding the detailed analysis of the museum curators. Similarly in the case of Paul Van Riper, military maverick. He destroyed a team of military brains in a Pentagon war game by his radical, guerilla, instinct led tactics.<br /><br />Ah, but thin slicing is not always a good idea - take the case of Coca Cola. In blind testing, Pepsi always comes out on top. Coke CEOs changed the recipe based on this and the result was a disaster. Why? Because in a sip test, Pepsi wins, over a whole can, Coke is preferred. Should have done more tests.<br /><br />Then there's the difficult area of instant racial profiling. Gladwell mentions the common racial test which proves that many of us have an unconscious wiring that prefers whites to blacks. In split second decisions taken by armed police this can be fatal. Thus poor Amadou Diallo, an innocent black man in the Bronx pulling out his wallet from his pocket found himself pounded down with bullets. So thin slicing not such a good idea there.<br /><br />What is the lesson Gladwell is trying to teach us here? He says he doesn't aim for all encompassing, overarching theories. Fair enough, but this doesn't excuse blunt contradiction. Seemingly, we should set up structures to ensure that our minds become conditioned to make the correct decision in the thin slicing moments. Gladwell concludes with a description of how orchestras stopped discriminating against female musicians by setting up auditions behind screens so the expert committee could make their correct intuitions based fairly on the sound produced.<br /><br />So if we are already an expert with world class knowledge and the conditions are fair, it is okay to trust our gut instinct. If we are not, then it is better to stop and think things through to avoid disaster. This seems to be the lesson, but little is resolved at the end of Blink despite its many impressive fragments.<br /><br />George Bush trusts his instincts - does Gladwell support every decision he makes? The reality of things is complicated, and the useful substance in Blink is pretty thin sliced fare.usicians by setting up auditions behind screens so the expert committee could make their correct intuitions based fairly on the sound produced.  <br /> <br />So if we are already an expert with world class knowledge and the conditions are fair, it is okay to trust our gut instinct.

B000BNI95Y|5.0|I went to Spain last summer, and saw her perform in the Metro Rock concert in Madrid - I had never heard of her before, had no idea who she was, just knew she was the headliner for the evening. She absolutely rocked my world! Her voice, her energy, her emotion - mesmerizing! This girl is truly amazing and she's so eclectic. Her style doesn't fit into any single category - she's pop, rock, flamenco, ballad, feminist...and that's just a generalization. This album is very catchy, and each song has something different to offer - there are fun, playful songs, serious criticisms of society, mournful songs of heartbreak, this CD has it all, and she more than pulls it off. A superb, extremely talented artist by any standards. I recommend this CD to everyone, you won't be disappointed. I've owned it for a year and still listen to it ALL the time - it's one of my top 10, and I'm not even a fluent Spanish speaker, so that's saying something.
B000F3AAUW|4.0|Like most, \\"Crazy\\" had me drastically foaming at the mouth for more. And while this CD has couple other songs that have about the same quality with the rest being decent enough, the entire album itself is WAY TOO SHORT. 37 minutes! Most of the songs are under 3 minutes and are fully started within 5 seconds, so it kinda feels like a bunch of fancy song clips. Give us a little foreplay or something!
B000ETQRCM|5.0|\\"More of the same?\\" of course it sounds the \\"same\\": it's the same band, and if it weren't it wouldn't be significant.  If you really love these guys for who they are and what they do, than you'll be   ecstatic to hear some fresh songs.  They fit right in there with all of your favorites.  Don't be a dumbass, buy the CD.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Wow, TooL's 10,000 days is a pure listening experience. This is without a doubt the best TooL release to date. TooL's work on this release is bold, experimental, atmospheric, mature, and all around well developed music that has been released within the last 10 years. Musicians take note this is the beginning of a new era in Music, as we know it today. One tends to forgot while listening to this CD that there are but just three members who play instruments, well four as Maynard James Keenan's voice has been taken to new horizons and has gone to new boundaries. There are wonderful influences in this musical release Pink Floyd comes to mind, though not in how TooL's musical direction goes but in the individual songs structure in of themselves, they are not afraid to be creative in each song's developments. Each song compliments each other, even the more mellow driven material has wonderful harmonies, allot of thought went into creating this Master of Music. I am so happy TooL and even their recording company allows these guys such room to be this creative. TooL you have saved Hard Rock and Metal music from being truly sucked into the abyss forever. 10,000 days will be the standard in the musical industry for years to come, by which all other releases will be judged.     Now TooL is not your average musical group, even though they play hard driven music TooL's music is best enjoyed, by setting aside some time. Light yourself a candle, flame up your favorite incense, have a pleasant drink that you can sip from, nothing heavy in alcohol. Also it is best to have done your bathroom duties, before listening to 10,000 days, the time length on this CD is well over an hour. Have the lights dimmed low, insert and play the CD, close your eyes and take a journey. Throughout listening to this CD I experienced wonderful emotional responses, I felt emotions as being afaird, happy, sad, at peace and harmony with myself and the Universe, and also I felt truly free while listening to the Music on this CD. Even those who do not normal like the harder side to music will not have a dull moment with this CD, TooL's 10,000 days is a pure listening experience. One can not just rush through listening to this CD, the music grabs hold and will not let go I have not taken the CD out of my player yet. If you rush through listening to this CD you will miss out, you must slow down, sit your butt down, and actually listen or you will kick yourself later. Listening to 10,000 days will be a journey of the mind, emotion, space and time itself. Enjoy the journey! See you when you get back.
B000000WJZ|5.0|Not much needs to be said about the sophomore Pumpkins' effort; it's in every fashion a timeless classic and one of the greatest early Nineties wonders.  Really, it's a bit underrated in the world of Nineties alternative, undermined by fellow '93 releases In Utero and Vs.  I can't explain why, but I think Dark Side of the Moon every time I hear this album.  Maybe because it's so subdued and ahead of its time and it expresses incredible confidence for a sophomore release, muck like Pink Floyd's biggest seller.  Or it could be that's it's just that damn good.  Look beyond the massive radio hits `Cherub Rock, Today, and `Disarm' and you'll find `Hummer, Geek USA' and an overlooked grungy epic `Quiet' to be just as satisfactory as the singles.  Could you just imagine if this masterpiece was released today?  It'd be like a new version of The Beatles on the Ed Sullivan Show for the first time.  As highly as I praise Vs., Siamese Dream made my best of '93 vote pretty obvious.

An honest and brave portrayal of addiction, and the struggle with self - regardless if you've sold million of records or living in a shelter.  This is a true account of the desperation of the disease of addiction, and the struggle to find a way out..and stay out one day at a time. <br />Excellent job, Mr. Keidis.
B000EWBKM6|3.0|I was not a consistent \\"Will & Grace\\" viewer over the years, although I did tune in occasionally. I thought the premise of the show was great when it first came out, but Debra Messing and Sean Hayes both kind of annoyed me. Of course, all four of the main characters on the show are supposed to be annoying in their own right, and Grace and Jack eventually grew on me after a while. I think the show was at its peak during the third, fourth, and fifth seasons, which is when I watched it the most. Then the character of Will started getting on my nerves around season six and I think the show began to lose some of its momentum, so I watched it much less regularly. I did tune in for the series finale, though, and overall I thought it was pretty good. (Warning: don't keep reading if you want to avoid spoilers!)<br /><br />Will and Grace both had a lot of romantic ups and downs over the years. Leo and Vince were my favorite love interests for them, so I was very happy that those two couples ended up together. However, it kind of sucked that Will and Grace drifted apart for so long. I was hoping that they'd reconcile after their two-year fight and then live happily ever after, but it didn't quite work out that way. Even though Will and Grace did make amends, their lives and families took them in two different directions and they didn't see each other at all for the next 16 years. When Will's son and Grace's daughter bumped into each other at college, they didn't even know each other! I thought that was kind of depressing. Still, it was kind of cool that Will and Grace ended up living vicariously through their children as Ben and Lila basically relived the way their parents met. Like Will and Grace, Ben and Lila hit it off instantly. They ended up getting married, and in that way, Will and Grace were eventually bonded by marriage, which was pretty cool.<br /><br />It was nice to see Karen and Jack living together after so many years. The duet that they sang was actually quite touching...they're both very talented vocalists. (I also love that Karen didn't age at all! Megan Mullally was always my favorite part of the show. Karen Walker rocks.) The quick appearance by Kevin Bacon was a nice touch, especially since one of the best things about \\"Will & Grace\\" is that it featured so many fantastic guest stars over the years. (I wish the writers could have figured out a way to bring back Michael Douglas for the finale...the episode with him is one of my favorite \\"Will & Grace\\" shows ever!) I also liked the final scene that showed the gang doing shots in the bar, just like old times.<br /><br />One random thing that bugged me...did anyone notice that Lila's hair was almost black when she was shown as a two-year-old, but then it magically turned the same shade of red as her mother's by the time she headed off to college? Similarly, Ben looked like an African American child as a two-year-old, but he was the splitting image of Eric McCormack when he was 18 years old. What was up with that?! Is there that much of a child's actor shortage in Hollywood? I doubt it.<br /><br />Again, I think it kind of sucked that Will and Grace spent almost 20 years apart, but maybe the point of that was to illustrate that the bond between them was so strong that they never would have been able to go off on their own and form lasting relationships with other people if they'd remained as close as they always had been. Regardless, Will and Grace ended up together at the end, and that's all that really matters. I don't think the series finale of \\"Will & Grace\\" will go down as being one of the best finales in television sitcom history, but it certainly wasn't the worst, either.

B000AMPZGC|5.0|When will Elfman get his due credit? The man is one of the most versitile composers of his day, and has not been awarded a thing. Personally I think that Nightmare before Christmas was his best. But Corpse Bride was fantastic. He know how to fit into Burton's visions perfectly.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I was shocked at the 3.5 cumulative rating here, but realized even after a quick glance that there's a rather understandable division between the BBC watchers and those who loved this later film.  However, it's really not necessary.<br /><br />But why choose?  Sure, they took liberties with this adaptation, but to me that makes sense -- it was the only direction to go after the definitive \\"traditional\\" rendition with the gorgeous BBC miniseries.  They did it all beautifully in that one.<br /><br />The 2005 version, it's grittier, faster, a little more brutal and sad too. I personally loved it -- it's fresh and fast and a new and lovely view of the story.  It's surprisingly swift-moving, very energetic, and a gorgeously made movie.  The acting is superb and the writing is great. It is not paced at all the way you expect these things, and I love the fact that (thanks to a few liberties with the book's time period) it looks and feels somehow very vibrant and real and just a little grungy.  The homes, the clothes, everything looks so real and lived-in (not frilly and clean and perfect the way these things usually are).  Even the dashing hero, who is quite hot, has terrible hair. And Kiera Knightley, who is not always a favorite of mine, is lovely and wonderful here. In this role, it's believable that (as beautiful as she is) that she is not fashionably beautiful or even noticeable, that her smarts and vivacity would be off-putting.  She is absolutely wonderful here, as is the entire cast (and Donald Sutherland is smashing in a scene very late in the movie as well).<br /><br />And yes, I still love Colin Firth.  But newcomers will find this Darcy terrific as well, in spite of his bad hair. ;-)
B0007TKNL0|4.0|I have heard some better singing, but this is an enjoyable film and CD. Probably not going to be a favorite of the straight operatic singer, or the high brow composer, but it appeals to the masses.
0307275639|5.0|We have all been influenced by someone special in our lives. This may have been a friend, a teacher, a coach, a family member, a parent, or a mentor. It is these unique individuals who touch our lives in such profound ways that change us forever. Tuesdays with Morrie, by Mitch Albom, is a heartwarming and emotionally touching story of one person's relationship with just such a person.  But the book, and the story it tells, is more than just entertainment, it is a poignant lesson on life that can help each of us. I would recommend that everyone read this story!
B00005QZ7U|5.0|The opening of this film is just breath taking.  I had never seen such a beautiful filming style.  Stylistically it has to be a definite favorite of mine.  It's crazy and I loved it.
B000002G87|5.0|This album was recorded when Clapton was twenty-five. He still had something to prove and had some fire in his belly. He boasted that he could get ten women a day to sleep with him and in his diary for the year 1970 he said he slept with 2,306 women. How did you even find the time, Slowhand? <br /> <br />But it's about quality, not quantity. He loved Gorgeous George Harrison's wife and wanted her instead. Hence this double album. She looked good in 1970 so I don't much blame him. <br /> <br />Anyway, back to our story. Clapton did \\"Tell the Truth\\" as a paean to lie detecting machines (a new technology at the time),\\"Why Does Love Got to Be So Sad,\\" which, despite its ungrammatical infelicities is a great slice of down home shoe-fly pie. (Alamabamans will know what I mean.) <br /> <br />And there's \\"Layla\\" itself. An odd coincidence: if you unscramble the word it spells \\"Ayala\\". This is the last name of the woman who was convicted of claiming she found a finger in her chili at Wendy's. Is there a connection? Probably not, but it's fun to think that there may be one. <br /> <br />Overall, this album: I like it. It has a good beat and you can dance to it. I give it five stars.
B00005JLSE|5.0|While I think that they did an excellent job with this film, the voices of these Stars do not impress me for such a show. I feel like they have had a lot of training and are signing their best, but they do not compare to the talents of \\"Real Musical Theater Singers\\". With the exception of the song Mr. Cellophane which is superior! Amazing to watch though.
B000E33VWW|5.0|Capote is a snapshot of the author at a certain point in time, and not a full length biography, which disappointed me at first, but, its brevity does not diminish its excellence. The action solely revolves around Truman being sent to Kansas to investigate the Clutter family murders for The New Yorker. He brings with him his lifelong friend, Harper Lee, who served as his research assistant. Once the movie begins, it is a challenge to pause. Phillip Seymour Hoffman put forth tremendous effort to recreate on screen (and I think accurately) one of the most distinctive personalities of our time. His charm was well-known and infectious and, most probably, completely fabricated. As a man, Capote may have had much in common with the killers of \\"In Cold Blood.\\" He was a pathological liar and didn't seem to have much of an interest in the suffering, or existence, of others. You get a glimpse of his lack of empathy when he goes to Harper Lee's party for To Kill a Mockingbird and doesn't notice her or extend his congratulations for her achievement. Another reflection of his soul comes at the outset when he tells the Kansas police sheriff that he doesn't care about who the killers are or if they'll ever be caught. The police are taken aback and the sheriff tells him, \\"Well, I do.\\" People were merely props for Capote, and he used them his entire life. Although it covers only a few year's time, this work tells us much about who the man really was.

B000EWBKM6|5.0|Really a nice ending to a memorable series.  I especially loved Jack and Karen serenading each other with Unforgettable, you could see them look at each other at the end and it was Sean Hayes looking at Megan Mullally and it was touching.  I always appreciated when Beverly Lesley was a character on the show so I was jazzed when he popped up, and his demise was appropriate.  As for Will and Grace, well I just thought the ending for them was perfect, but was it just me or did you notice that no mention was made if Grace was still with Leo or Will was still in his partnership..it was just Will and Grace again....interesting...Well, I was a fan of this series, but I thought all the guest stars hurt the overall quality of the show, but I have to admit my favorite episode was the one when Michael Dougles guest stared...and I never warmed to Will's last boyfriend, I just never saw Will with someone like him, they just had no chemistry, I was always partial to Patrick Dempsey, he and Will had great chemistry and they made a handsome couple..anyway, it's a bit sad that it's all over, but at least it went out with a touching finale, that summed all the characters up in a heartwarming way and I can't help, but feel good about that fact.
B000ETQRCM|1.0|After reading some of the very positive reviews both by 'professional' rock critics and by PJ fans I was really excited to hear this new album but after listening to the album several times, I have to say that I'm sorely dissapointed.  In fact it was difficult for me to try and listen to this multiple times hoping that it would grow on me.      The hype about this being their best album in 10 years is just that - hype.  I truely respect this band and have enjoyed most of their albums but sorry to say I can't see how this stacks up as one of their better albumns.  IMHO a couple of good songs does not make the whole album worthy of four or five stars.      If you're new to PJ check out just about anything else from them.......sorry guys
0441009425|2.0|In this dry, dessicated, overly long novel Alastair Reynolds manages to waste 585 pages that NEVER would have been published inside the pages of Astounding. By completely losing sight of the human element of science fiction he has turned a promising plot and descent scenario into a novel that reads like a tenth grade science textbook. One of the rules of John W. Campbells'  ASTOUNDING science fiction was the effect of science on humanity-and there is nothing emotional about this novel whatsover. Populated by boring, lifeless characters,the reader has no stake in this novel. Combined with some of the worst editing I have ever seen (numerous typos, mispells, and even inaccurate page sequencing) make this one of the most disappointing novels I have read in a long time. Don't waste your money or time on this. Although the ideas and concepts in this novel are some of the most original and innovative I have come across in quite a while I found it nearly impossible to care because the characters were so one-dimensional. This was the problem that John W. Campbell first encountered when he took over the pages of Astounding as the editor. His first rule for all of his writers was to make sure that the reader understood the effect of the science and concepts of the story on the characters and society. John W. Campbell fully belived that unless the reader was willing to invest his intrest in the outcome of the characters and cared what happened to them all the great storylines in the world were no better than reading science textbooks-and so it is with Revelation Space.
0141301104|5.0|This was one of my first books to really read through. I fell in love with it at once and I couldn't stop reading it. It is brilliant writing! You can easily imagine everything Dahl writes as fact. I will always hold Roald Dahl in my heart as the person who set my reading heart on fire, and I have been an avid reader ever since! I still pull this book off the shelf and read it every couple of years. I am 21 and I still am enthralled with it. I now look for other books that he has written and still love his stuff. I will always be a fan, and you should be too, starting with this one! A great book - FOR ALL AGES!
0790733226|5.0|The big thing that suprised me from this movie upon further examination is the strength with which carl sagan, an self-confessed atheist, gave to the character of palmer joss, a man of the cloth \\"without the cloth\\". Its wonderfully refreshing to see a script that doesn't present the faithful as delusional and unintelligent, but rather those with humbled opinions that deserve as much merit as anything scientific. The point-counterpoint conversations between ellie and he were marvelous (I'd need proof...Did you love your father? Prove it), and only added to the beauty of this film. The effects, as breathtaking as they are, only exist to serve the plot, and my only wish was that I could have seen this is theaters. Oscar material for Best Picture, IMHO, but back in '97, no one was gonna dare take a chance during the year of Titanic, a movie that I felt fell victim to the fx, and lost all feeling. John Hurt, fantastic as always. Tom Skerrit as a true a$$, and James Woods, as small his part was, marvelous. I can't say enough good things about this movie.

I HAD to buy it and when I first got it home, I watched it over and over until I had memorized the songs and could sing along. It is one of my all time favorite movies and I think it will always be. If you haven't seen it this special edition is worth it!
0448060191|4.0|I'm sure there are plenty of reviews on the actual story, so I'll just comment on this particular edition of Little Women.  I'm referring to the Grosset & Dunlap Illustrated Junior Library edition.  I found this at a local Borders and was immediately attracted to the cover illustration.  This is a beautiful book.  There are many illustrations throughout the book, both in color and in back and white (the majority are in black and white).<br />When I looked it up on Amazon, I was a little hesitant about buying this book because I had read reviews stating that it only contained the first half of the story (288 pages).  The book I bought (at Borders) contains the entire story (643 pages).  So, if you like the appearance of this particular edition, but are put off by the lack of the second half, it is available with the complete story.  Just be careful when making your selection.
B000E6FSPW|3.0|I had this CD years ago and it got lost in the shuffle.  I bought another copy and I can say it is not the same.  Some songs are missing, and there are some new ones that I am not particularly fond of.  Its pretty good overall, but this version doesnt even have \\"Gonna Fly Now.\\"  Its blasphemy I tell you.  Be aware of what you are buying, this version is different.

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|This is a fabulous movie.  I saw it 11 times in the theater.  Then I bought two DVDs just in case one wears out.  I keep it in the DVD player at all times.  I had not seen the A&E miniseries but I watched it right after I saw the new movie and I liked it, too. Then I read the book--I think I know everything there is to know about Pride and Prejudice. The 2005 movie is just gorgeous!  The music is awe-inspiring--buy the CD! The cinematography is breathtaking--the beauty of England shines through. It is the epitome of a great love story. I don't understand the negative reviews.  I would give it a dozen stars if I could.
B000E41MRC|5.0|Just in terms of technical camera use this is one of the great films.   Masterful. The National Socialist propaganda film used to   convince the German people to go along with the madness.    Anyone who watches any network news should be required to watch   this film. That's pretty much all of us. Watching this film with   the foreknowledge that of what resulted, gives us all a better   understanding of what government, any goverment, can do and does   to its people. Popular emotion and beliefs can be and are managed   through the media. Gosh, maybe even here in America.
B0000700KL|5.0|This film is a uniquely artistic and spiritual achievement. The images and views are spectacular. The planet is shown in its pristine natural beauty, . The volcanoes of Hawaii are viewed from the air and close up, close enough to see the red hot glowing lava arise from the bowels of Mother Earth. The Iguacu Water Falls in Argentina, a Brazilian rainforest and the Kayapo Village Indians, Monument Valley in Arizona, views of Ayers Rock in the Uluru National Park in Australia are among my favorite recollections of natural scenes. The only accompaniment to this fantastic imagery is the original and outstanding music created by Michael Stearns. There are no comments ... no subtitles, none are required, the scenery and images speak for themselves. The film is extraordinairily beautiful, breath-taking, and sometimes dismaying in its truthful depiction of life on planet earth. The concept development by Ron Fricke and the scene development by Mark Magidson and Bob Green are worthy of recognition in the film industry. I am surprised the film gathered no awards ... Its popularity via \\"word of mouth\\" is likely due to the visual impact of visiting twenty four countries on six continents within 104 minutes ...which is a monumental achievement.<br /><br />Mankind's impact on nature and the environment are clearly brought into focus without a word being uttered: one views burning oil fields in Kuwait, a garbage dump in India where the poor sort through trash, plus a few stark images of Auschwitz and the skulls and photographs of victims of Killing Fields in Cambodia. The reprimand is felt ... the destruction is seen, the concern for the future is real. Yet the film is balanced showing monuments and pyramids from ancient Egypt, the temples of Angkor Wat, Cambodia ... the terra cotta Warriors in Xian, China ... the Hagia Sophia Temple in Istanbul Turkey ... Mecca, Saudia Arabia ... the Shiraz Mosque in Iran ... St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican, the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Israel and Jews prayng at the Wailing Wall. The less than satisfying moments for me were, 1) the sped up traffic scenes in New York, 2) views of people getting on and off a train, likely in Japan, and 3) the monkey chant at one of the Far East Asian temples, it seemed too prolonged, my preference would have been to tour the site instead. Cutting out the first entirely and reducing the time viewing the second and third would improve my enjoyment of the film (4.5/5 stars).<br /><br />The most memorable scenery includes views of children living in poverty stricken areas of South America, the city landfill in Calcutta, India, where poor people sort garbage, and the funeral pyres along the Ganges River ... Words are inadequate to describe these views. This film displays the natural beauty of earth and man's impact on the environment and the world via astonishing images and scenes ... Despite the diversity of the planet, the interconnectedness of life is so well depicted, the film is deeply felt and should be experienced by more people.

0385720920|5.0|\\"Choke\\" was my introduction into the world of Chuck Palahniuk.  I am not sure how I missed both the book and the movie \\"Fight Club\\" but Palahnuik is a highly creative and imaginative writer whose work is compelling and admirable.<br /><br />\\"Choke\\" is the life of main character Victor Mancini, a recovering sex addict who devices a scheme to pay for his mothers' exorbitant nursing home stay.  Victor purposefully chokes at restaurants in order for other diners to save his life by performing the Heimlich Maneuver.  Victor's reasoning is that his savoirs will feel heroic about themselves and in turn feel responsible for Victor's life.  Victor bilks money out of his savoirs by telling them about his money woes and ends up receiving checks annually from each Good Samaritan. \\"You gain power by pretending to be weak. By contrast, you make people feel so strong. You save people by letting them save you. All you have to do is stay fragile and grateful. So stay the underdog. People really need somebody they feel superior to\\".<br /><br />Victor also works as an Irish indentured servant at \\"Colonial Dunsboro\\" a fictional period theme park, \\"At $7 and hour it is increadibly realistic\\" muses Victor.  Since reading this book I find that I look at historical theme parks differently, it's hard to describe if you haven't read this book but one particular quote sums this feeling up well, \\"We're all trapped. It's always 1734. All of us, we're stuck in the same time capsule, the same as those television shows where the same people are marooned on the same desert island for thirty seasons and never age or escape. They just wear more makeup. In a creepy way, those shows are maybe too authentic\\".<br /><br />Though the main character at first seems abominable, Victor is a classic underdog. This book will capture you from the first page<br />in which Victor is introduced as the son of a demented and paranoid woman through to a realization that there is a bit of Victor Mancini in us all.  The book is about a journey of self discovery and acceptance of one's own identity.  There are lines in this book that are thought provoking which you will want to re-read such as, \\"The unreal is more powerful than the real.<br />Because nothing is as perfect as you can imagine it. Because it's only intangible ideas, concepts, beliefs, fantasies that last. Stone crumbles. Wood rots. People, well, they die.<br />But things as fragile as a thought, a dream, a legend, they can go on and on.  If you can change the way people think, she said. The way they see themselves. They way they see the world. If you do that, you can change the way people live their lives. And that's the only lasting thing you can create.<br />Besides, at some point,your memories, your stories and adventures, will be the only things you have left.\\"  Sorry to use so many quotes in this review but there are so many great lines and I want to convey the brilliance of this book. You will need to keep an open mind while reading Choke, but in the end you will be rewarded by this extraordinary story.self discovery and acceptance of one's own identity.

B000F1IQMS|5.0|Eric Bana (Troy, Chopper) in a dynamic performance stars as Avner,a man who is assembled to a team of agents who are sent to eliminated 11 people who were involved in the kidnapping of athletes in the 1972 Olympics in Munich. Bana's team consists of Daniel Craig (Layer Cake, Enduring Love), Ciaran Hinds (Rome, Veronica Guerin) and Mathieu Kassovitz (Birthday Girl, The 5th Element), plus others. Their information is giving by the guy who started it all played by the always great Geoffrey Rush (Finding Nemo, Lantana). Soon Bana and his team are off to eliminate them all and also Bana's family could be in danger in the process. It's a powerful film with superb performances all around. Spielberg shows the horror and the chaos of what happened with bloody, brutal results. It's one of the best films that came last year and all I gotta say is bravo. Not for all tastes but I think if someone went threw what happened it would of been a horrible experience to go threw. Also starring Yvan Attal (The Interpreter, At Dawning) and Ayelet Zurerl (Maktub, A Night Without Lola).
B0007OCG4W|2.0|The characters in this film keep deceiving each other, showing frailty and coldness at the same time. So many films fall into this trap. Apparently, being a real adult means lying, masking your boring existence with sexual adventures, being ironic instead of having a sense of humor, and being completely self-obsessed.     Some people might welcome this film after an overdose of Hollywood sugary romantic flicks, but there is a whole wide world out there of films with interesting things to say. This one is as shallow as it is pretentious.
B000AMJDHY|5.0|When I first heard of this band, I was expecting to be disappointed, but in looking back, I can't figure out why.  I guess it's because in some ways I am a music snob.  My music tastes have matured from when I was younger and while I am in no way stating that I am fully mature (I'm 21), this cd is aural crack for me.   Every song has the potential to make me dance, make me sing, this cd can bring me out of a horrible mood.  It is unique.  I like the song titles,  especially after realizing that some of the song names came from my favourite books and movies. ('the only difference between suicide and martyrdom...' being from the book survivor by chuck palahniuk and 'lying is the most fun...' coming from the movie closer.) <br />The main thing I can say about this cd is PUT ASIDE YOUR SNOBBERY, and listen to music that is actually fun to listen to.  Believe me, turning aside a cd because it isn't 'scene' enough doesn't hurt anyone but you. <br />

I love Sophie Kinsella's Becky but Emma is MUCH funnier...and I didn't start off hating her lol. I just read A Desirable Residence (which was horrible by the way) by Madeleine Wickham (Kinsella's real name) and it's just amazing the difference between them! Can You Keep a Secret? is now my favorite book by this author and I think she will have a very hard time topping this.

0553588486|2.0|I will straightaway say that I can't even finish this book.  I've read far better literature and far better fantasy.  Normally I would say badly written escapism has its uses, but this book was so boring that I tremble at the thought of slogging through 500-600 more pages of the first book alone.  But let me explain myself.<br /><br />The prose is horribly bad and colorless.  I nearly laughed aloud at a tree being described as rustling like a \\"living thing\\".  And not only is that ridiculous, the simile is used again in the first portion of the book.  The descriptions as a whole are so terrible that I can't get a good image of the world.  They're just not interesting, fresh or original.  If you don't believe me, then compare Martin's prose with such works as Mervyn Peake's Titus Groan and A. A. Attanasio's The Dragon and the Unicorn.  No prose can be perfect, but this is just unforgivable.  It has no taste and no style.  A child could write better description.<br /><br />Next, the characters.  It's absolutely ridiculous and bad art to expect readers to get through 200+ pages before they can care about the characters.  I don't care how long the series is; it's bad craft for character likeability to take so long.  Most singular novels range from 250-400 pages.  And even after 200 pages, I still can't care about Martin's characters because none of them are interesting or heartfelt.  They feel like they were made with cookie-cutters with no distinguishing features.  Switch Catelyn and Eddard, or Rob and Jon, and Sansa and Arya, and would it matter?  Hardly.  The character interactions are complex, but so many other authors have handled such complexity AND have better prose and lingering characters.<br /><br />Now for the plot.  It's horribly dull.  All it is is cliched political intrigue.  I agree that the wolves, too, are in the book to look cute or \\"cool\\".  And the symbolism of the wolf dead with an antler in its throat is so blatant that I'm amazed the characters are so stupified as to not see it.  Okay, the plot does move at a decent pace, but it's just not fresh or interesting.  It's typical, from where I stand in the book.  If it develops further on in the book, I might never know.<br /><br />Some may say it's a failing to write an opinion on a book I haven't finished.  But it should NOT take 200+ pages of reading before the story develops.  As I've said, it's bad craft.  there are certain rules of writing that can't be ignored, and one of them is that the bloody hook should be in the very first paragraph, even as the first sentence.  And if you choose not to follow that rule, then something of interest should crop up in the first 50-100 pages.  Martin does not succeed here.<br /><br />Once again, there's better fiction out there.  I recommend staying away from this book unless a) political intrigue is your cup of tea, or b) you have nothing else to read.s are so stupified as to not see it.

B000C65Z1G|3.0|I had been anticipating this one for a long time, since the book had always gotten so much acclaim. Ralph Fiennes is a marvelous actor and anything he's in is worth watching, if you ask me. But the storyline itself just didn't capture me, and now I'm going to have to go back and read the book and then watch this again, to see if it's me or if it's the story.
0679783261|4.0|Jane Austen's novels have a recurring theme of love and marriage and forever invoke the absurdly beautiful art of humour and irony to fabricate a mesh of interwoven ideas tied by that central idea. Detractors of this late 17th. century and early 18th. century novelist have repeatedly pointed at her unimaginative superficiality and her meek satisfaction to restrain her works on the fringes of the social chaos. Indeed austen never ventures deep into the society's demeanours but it's this contraint of her to resolve to poke fun at the society and the people who live in it by employing the canny and subtle instrument of satire sharpened by sly humour that makes Austen such a popular and hugely succesful novelist as she is. Nowhere is this attribute so vehemently explicit as in \\"Pride and Prejudice\\",regarded by many as the most accomplished work in English literature for its fairy-tale gratifications as well as for its replete involvement of humour.<br /><br />Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" revolves around,as the title itself sugests,the pride of a person and the prejudice of another,both so bizzarely related and paradoxically driving these two persons away from each other. But the \\"first impressions\\" that the general reader gets is only a figment of the authoress's array of ideas conjugated into a rare commodity of literature that both thrills and provokes broodings,and beyond it everything must remain a surprise. Elizabeth Bennet and Mr.Fitzwilliam Darcy are the principle characters of the novel and it's the pride of the latter that actually raiss the prejudice of the former that lents the story an excuse to stretch on as long as it does. \\"Pride and PRejudice\\" is the tale of the gradual stripping down of the prejudice simulataneous with the quiescent passing away of the pride in a quid pro quo style.<br /><br />The Bennets are a family of seven unique members living in the Hertfordshire village of Longbourn and from the very inception it's clear that the book is going to be a light read and a hilarious one at that. Mrs.Bennet,\\"a woman of mean understandind,little information,and uncertain temper\\" whose \\"buisness of life was to get her daughters married\\" is a constant source of laughter in the book,her husband Mr.Bennet,\\"so odd a mixture of quick parts,sarcastic humour,reserve,and caprice\\",is a man deliberately detached from the fetters of responsibility that marriage and fatherhood unfailingly brings and their five daughters are all so invariably different. The eldest,Jane,is a beautiful,placid,unassuming,innocent and believe-good-in-everything girl,Elizabeth is beautiful too and with a certain charm of intelligence and elegance of wit,Lydia and Catherine both are consumed in their false notions of love and marriage and Mary is a book-worm possessing the slightest touch of a philosopher. The story begins when a rich bachelor,a wanteed catch in the authoress's era,Mr.Charles Bingley rents a house near Longbourn. Mrs.bennet is despearate to get one of her daughters married to him and part of her wish does come true indeed when Jane and Mr.Bingley fall in love with each other. But the fairy-tale symphony stops abruptly here and under the influence of his sisters and friend Mr.Darcy---a man who likes to maintain an air of pride and aristrocracy about him and draws a line between him and others---Mr.Bingley returns to London. Of course there's the whisper of a tagedy in this sequence which is easily subdued in the vociferous humourous actions of Mr.Collins,to whom the Bennets's Longbourn estate is entailed. It's his arrival which brings forth the nature of most of the characters. Mrs.Bennet gets a scope to exhibit her want of intelligence,Mr.Bennet is openly satiric and mocking,Elizabeth is cynical though not without reason and Jane is at her inocent best. Mr.Collins proposes Elizabeth,gets rejected and goes on to marry Charlotte Lucas,doughter of the Bennets's neighbour Sir William Lucas. This is one marriage that occurs withouteven an iota of harmony or intelligence but has all elements of illusory marriage done in haste and without forbrooding.<br /><br />There's a furthur twist in the tale as Darcy conveys Elizabeth his love for her much against his \\"better judgement\\" and gets rejected. Inevitably. And from this conjuction onwards,the principle theme of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" gets its proper shape and dimension. One by one the pieces of rags of prejudice war off Elizabeth and she realises the true character of Wickham who elopes with Lydia and comprehends the man of noble character in Darcy undrneath the layer of abstract ego. Simulataneously Darcy rejects the scepticism his gentryclass has cursed him with and emerges from being \\"the most disagreeable man in the world\\" to a man with \\"no improper pride\\". The metamorphoses in both Elizabeth and Darcy are not sudden or abrupt but gradual yet stunning and reveal the genius of the script-writer to compose a novel of characters in an overtone of irony and delicate humour.<br /><br />In all there're four marriages accomplished in the book and all are vastly different. So a happy-ever-after ending? Yes,but at the same time not without patches of apprehension. In a fine symmetrical plot lacking a concrete stucture and a specific ambition with no specific slots of a 'hero' as such,Jane Austen has managed to portary a variety of characters segmented into different natures. The opening sentence of te novel(\\"It is a truth univerally acknowledge,that a single man in possession of a good fortune,must be in want of a wife\\".) is an ironical statement---perhaps the sharpest in the book---that has descended down the ages to be renowned as one of the better opening lines of any novel. This irony is come to realised in the first chapter itself as we discern that it's not the man who runs after the woman but just the opposite. \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is scattered wit several other ironies that provide food for the subsistence of the plot. Jane Austen also hints at the grotesque pride and egomania sustained by the gentry folk and at the same instant doesn't leave the intellectually deprived petty mentality and confined ambitions of the commonfolk out of her domain of satire. In a world of two differebt parts,Elizabeth and Darcy are the sole strings that hold them together. The regal coupling of narration and dialogue exalt the quality of the novel even higher,though being marked mainly from the perspective of Elizabeth in spite of invoking an omniscient narrator the storyline does lose some gloss. But even so,in a world of imperfection and preposterous false ideas and beliefs,Jane Austen's this remarkable work of literature hints at the chimera of a fairytale translating itself into reality,or be it a hollow reality. All the characters are superbly drawn and in them as wel as in the sequence of all those marvellous events,the reader would decipher his own self and actions from his own life and surroundings. And for that he must be grateful to a writer of excellent wit and humour.
0316172324|3.0|Gladwell is certainly more talented than I am. If he were to write the review I am writing now, the review would be 8 pages long, it will make essentially the same point that I will, but you won't get bored at all. <br /> <br />That's my impression of Gladwell based on Blink. There is, IMHO, exactly ONE point conveyed by the book. There are numerous examples that I have (and you too could) used to start or maneuver cocktail conversations. But the insight from each example is the same. It is ridiculous that any review of the book basically gives this away also. <br /> <br />It is interesting and light (mostly) - so it makes good reading material for bedtime or the subway. <br /> <br />But this is not a book you want to buy - this is poor reference material, and you could borrow it from your library and return it in two days anyway!
0761536434|1.0|This has been the third book on history of video games I have read. This time, the author or, more probably, the editor went far calling this the \\"ultimate\\" history of such an underestimated field of culture as videogames are. If I buy a book allegedly \\"Ultimate\\" in anything, I definitely have to have high expectations. And this is what I expected. <br /> <br />I expected: <br /> <br />1. An accurate account on how the first supercomputer users were able to make the leap from research implementations to entertaining implementations. <br /> <br />2. An accurate account of the facts which lead to the origin of the first video game ever. <br /> <br />3. An account of how were made the most important video games: Pong, Space Invaders, Pac Man, Final Fantasy, Super Mario, Sonic The Hedgehog, The Legend of Zelda, Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat, Doom, Virtua Fighter, and some other which were not just important in terms of public momentary success but as well for helping define the way video games would be made in the future. <br /> <br />4. A brief introduction on game design to basically understand the way the mentioned games were created. <br /> <br />5. A truly book on history, and this goes a lot far from financial history. An account on how the major games were received by gamers and the impact they could have had in mass media. <br /> <br />6. Full cover of both the Japanese and North American game companies, designers, markets, etc. <br /> <br />And, sadly, this is what I got: <br /> <br />1. Over 200 pages on the first 5 years of gaming. You can read a lot of information on obscure games developed by the friends of the author. <br /> <br />2. A special chapter on... Pinball games (?) <br /> <br />3. A weird obsession on Atari and unrrelevant gossip about Atari employees. In fact you have to go through 299 pages of information on the other businesses of former Atari executives and extra gossip and reviews of obscure games until you read the words \\"Super\\" and \\"Mario\\"in the same sentence <br /> <br />4. Self promotion of the magazine the author works in. <br /> <br />5. Adulation of the author's friends in the gaming business. For example, some derivative games are given superior status, while more original games are hardly mentioned. For example, the conception of the seminal \\"Street Fighter II\\" is described in a hurry through two pages, while a whole chapter of the book is called \\"Mortal Kombat... <br /> <br />6. Almost no mention about the japanese videogame industry, which is unacceptable to say the least. The only japanese mentions that made it to the book were related with the SEGA, Sony and Nintendo executives along with tids and bits of even more unrrelevant gossip. <br /> <br />I never read accurate accounts on anything, just information thrown away, unexplicably transcribed court decissions an *lots* of interviews excerpts (which, for the most part, make more than the half of the book. I have to say that the interviews saved the book from total disaster: while reading them, you don't have to deal with the author's nonsense) and finally a lot of uninterpretated history dates and financial information absolutely prescindible because they normally lack of further explanations. <br /> <br />It's clear that videogames are an underestimated field of popular culture, but history is history. It doesn't matter if you write about the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire or the history of videogames, it takes a historian to perform such task, not a mere videogame journalist wich became obsessed with the Atari 2600 console (by the way, the author refusses to call it that way, he properly calls it Atari VCS, which is confusing, since three Atari consoles beared that same technic name). <br /> <br />This book is lacking, dissapointing and empty. It certainly is long, but it lacks of true contents and is merely stuffed with uninteresting information on videogame industry CEOs, chairmen, presidents and what their respective wives and/or lovers liked to have in restaurants and which clothes they used to wear. <br /> <br />This book seems to have been written by E! Entertainment Television. The author has no sense on what history is: he thinks that history of games is chronological review of games and consoles... <br /> <br />Just what happens when a journalist attempts to be a historian...
B00002ND77|4.0|MALCOLM X is a powerful and compelling biography, chronicling the struggle, the rise and the tragic fall of a great American individual.  Denzel Washington SHOULD have received his Oscar for this performance.  It wasn't anything racist because the Academy normally bestows Oscars to actors for the WRONG performances (Al Pacino for SCENT OF A WOMAN?  Paul Newman for THE COLOR OF MONEY?  Forget about it!).<br /><br />The only real problem I had was with the way Spike Lee chose to end the film.<br /><br />He spends three hours telling the very raw human story of how Malcolm X lived and died--and then tacks on what feels like a recruitment film that worships the image of the man, the kind of deification that might have made Malcolm uneasy.  And made me think the filmmakers may have missed the point.<br /><br />Still, a great biography.

This book is the first in a series of novels that span a period of history that is both brutal and beautiful at the same time. The series is set in the period of history when England and Nepolianic France are at war. The author has drawn from rather more than created his own history and it is done very well. I have just finished the last and incomplete novel and am sorely sorry that it is over, but alas I will read them again! Patrick O'Brian has painted such a rich and vivid picture of this period of history. I will spend more time and perhaps do some reserach on some of the rich history that this series covers.

B00005JP42|5.0|Rian Johnson's \\"Brick\\" won a Special Jury Prize at the Sundance Festival for originality of vision, and seldom has an award been more deserved. This witty, breathlessly entertaining low-budget flick conflates modern-day high-school angst with the mean-street conventions of 1940s detective fiction and movies. The surprise is that director/screenwriter Johnson plays the story absolutely straight, and gets away with it, while at the same time touching on some uncomfortable truths about growing up in America. Brendan Frye (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), whose delicate, poetic looks belie his limitless resources of toughness and courage, goes underground among his school's drug-addled \\"upper crust\\" to uncover the murderers of his ex-girlfriend Emily (Emilie de Ravin). He endures multiple beatings from the goon Tugger (Noah Fleiss), as well as threats from both The Pin (Lukas Haas), a cadaverous criminal mastermind who still lives with his doting mother, and Assistant Vice Principal Trueman (Richard Roundtree), who basically plays the Barton McLane role to Gordon-Levitt's Bogart. Then there are the femmes fatales in training, Laura (Nora Zehetner) and Kara (Meagan Good), who may or may not be helping Brendan. \\"Brick\\" is remarkably stylish and atmospheric for its miniscule budget; Johnson is masterful at capturing the claustrophobic milieu in which Brendan and his antagonists lurk. There are scenes of action and suspense here that put big-budget epics like \\"V for Vendetta\\" to shame, simply because Johnson knows how to edit, and because he makes us care about the characters, especially Brendan. I never paid much attention to Gordon-Levitt until I saw his performance as an emotionally damaged male prostitute in Gregg Araki's \\"Mysterious Skin.\\" Based on his performances here and in that film, I would say that Gordon-Levitt is quickly becoming one of the truly great American screen actors. All the other actors are also fine, including Matt O'Leary as The Brain, Brendan's informant and only true friend, and Noah Segan as the pathetic \\"reef worm\\" Dode. Some critics have complained about \\"Brick's\\" convoluted plot and stylized dialogue--Johnson creates a language for his characters that is half Chandleresque slang, half teen speak. But for me they only added to the film's fascination. You'll probably need to see the film more than once to catch all the details, but, then again, you'll WANT to see it more than once.

0393317552|5.0|Plenty of positive reviews have been written, look at them for a good description of the book. I'm gonna clear up some of the statements that have been made by the negative reviwers.  <br />Racial answers for world disparity are quite clearly racist. Just about all the negative reviews for this book here are racist, ranging from transparently covered to nakedly blatant racism. Much reference has been made to the \\"bell curve\\" study made in the US about IQ score differences between the declared racial groups of \\"White, Asian, Hispanic, Black.\\" It supposedly shows a bell curve increment of Asians, Whites, Hispanics, and Blacks. Many white supremacists here will probably switch Whites and Asians. The problem with this study is that it reflects factors in America other than absolute regional race. For one, \\"Blacks\\" in America are of varying African/European ancestry, whereas \\"Hispanics\\" ranges from people of purely European Spanish ancestry to mostly indigenous American ancestry. This clearly reflects factors of linguistic bias, nutrition, and education rather than racial differences. In addition, how can you explain the contradition of Mongoloid Asians being 1 step above Whites, yet Hispanics, who range from various European/Mongoloid Native American ancestry being 1 step below Whites? Only an idiot would believe that this reflects any issue of inherent racial intelligence superiority. <br />I also want to clear up Diamond's statement of New Guineans probably being smarter on average than Europeans. Obviously he does not say this conclusively, as it cannot be proven. Understand that he points out the issue that in hunter-gatherer New Guinean societies, intelligence is naturally selected-- people with the ability to build effective structures, create effective trails, and other intelligence-related skills are favored. In urban European societies, however, rampant disease due to close proximity and poor santitation in cities selected differently. The ability to be \\"machiavellian\\" is not selected by nature; peasants or common people have just as good an opportunity to REPRODUCE and pass on their genetic material. Therefore, European socities selected more for disease resistance rather than intelligence. Of course, due to the brief time period, the effect is probably minimal, but made a lasting impact as disease-resistant Whites could wipe out millions of Native Americans and other indigenous peoples just by their presence.
B000001Y2U|5.0|I spent all night reading every review. The two things I've consistantly read from manson haters is that the music is lacking, and that he's a lyrical nuscence. Not only is this album by far manson's most creative a well produced, but for anyone who likes hard rock music, this album should at least be well respected. More importantly, I want to know why people are either afraid, irritated, or even offended my MM. There is a simple and clear underlying message: Don't stick to one way of thinking. It's that simple. None of us know for sure what's absolutely right or wrong, so stay away from religion and conformity.  If you're a christian, guess what, the KKK consider themselves to be christian too, and there are millions of people of different religious denominations that believe  you are going to hell for your beliefs. What makes you right and them wrong?

The movie is fantastic!  Great for young and old alike.  The characters are well thought out and the story very entertaining.  A must for any Disney lover's collection.
B000B0QOJA|5.0|I was surprised when this album got released. It contains previously unreleased songs at fairly good sound quality. At this point in time its hard to imagine music this good, from such an influential artist, to have remained in hiding since 1965. To those who are unfamiliar with Coltrane, this is a live radio broadcast of Coltrane with his classic quartet lineup just a short time before Coltrane radically changed directions. To the Coltrane fan its an indispensable addition. It is sheer joy to listen to \\"One Down, One Up\\" which, to my understanding, has been influencing jazz musicians for many years in bootleg formats. Also, Coltrane's revisting of his standards, such as \\"Afro Blue\\" and \\"My Favourite Things\\", document his growth and show how much he had changed since he first recorded versions of those songs earlier that decade. Having said that, to those who are not Coltrane fans and want to get initiated, I would recomend earlier albums from the classic quartet. For example, if you dont have \\"Love Supreme\\", I would ask, why not? It is, at least, the most universally loved of his albums. If you like to buck the convention, I still would recomend earlier albums such as \\"Crescent\\" (recorded just a few months before Love Supreme) or the album entitled simply \\"Coltrane\\", his first studio album with the classic quartet for Impulse records. I am pleased to see that this album is selling well, which is a testament to Coltrane's reputation. It is a great and historic jazz album. I would readily acknowledge, however, that this album is definitely a non-conventional jazz album that may not appeal to those who like traditional jazz.
0446310786|4.0|This story elequently tells the story of the progression of the life of an initially eight year old child by the nickname of scout finch. This allows for the perspective of an innocent eye initially in the novel, though as time progresses and matters become more serious this outlook it easily taken aback because of the increasing maturity of the child. Harper Lee takes her time in getting to the story, though this sort of writing, which first builds a familiarity with the characters before setting the personalities they contain into conflict, allows for a more rich experience in the climax.

Now I am The Master.\\"<br /><br />\\"You can't win Darth. If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine.\\"<br /><br />\\"Remember, \\"The Force\\" will be with you..., always.\\"<br /><br />- Luke Skywalker yearns to learn the family business, Darth Vader tells Obi-Wan Kenobi he's no square, but, Obi-Wan tells his former apprentice he, once again, has the high ground & spiritually tells Luke to keep the faith in \\"Star Wars\\"<br /><br />Released 29 & a 1/2 years ago, in less than 32 theaters nationwide (compared to \\"Revenge Of The Sith\\"'s 3600+ theaters), \\"Star Wars\\" still remains one of the great all time science fiction films, that is a tribute to the Flash Gordon, Buck Rogers, & Western serials of the past. \\"Star Wars\\" gave the dying sci-fi genre a much needed jolt in the arm, in the late 70's & has generated millions of fans the world over. The film, after all these years, still remains one of the highest grossing films in history (currently at 450+ million dollars).<br /><br />Taking place roughly twenty years after \\"Episode III: Revenge Of The Sith\\", \\"Star Wars\\" (renamed \\"Epiosde IV: A New Hope\\" in 1999, after the release of the first prequel film) has the galaxy under the grip of the tyrannical Galactic Empire (the former Republic from the prequel films).<br /><br />The Empire's ultimate weapon, The Death Star (shown in a skelatal structure at the end of \\"Sith\\") has come to fruition & spells certain doom for the small band of rebels trying to restore freedom to the galaxy.<br /><br />Princess Leia, senator of the planet Alderaan, races home aboard her starship after stealing schematic plans to the battle station. Imperial forces, led by Darth Vader, intercept the ship, take Leia hostage, & destroy the ship, but, not before the Princess records a short message to Genaral Obi-Wan Kenobi & downloads the message with the valuable, stolen Death Star plans into a nearby astromech droid. As fate would have it, Artoo-Detoo is the recipient & with his companion See-Threepio use an escape pod to get off the ship blasting to the planet of Tatooine below.<br /><br />Once on the surface, & through some unusual circumstances, the droids fall into the hands of Owen Lars, & his step-nephew, Luke Skywalker. While cleaning up the two droids, Luke accidently stumbles across the ending of the message Artoo was trying to keep hidden (\\"Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. Your my only hope\\").<br /><br />Luke tells his Uncle about the message & in response wants both droids memory's erased (it must have dawned on Owen that both droids have been here before & he knows the history surrounding them). Luke also asks if he can join the Academy (most of his friends have already gone), but, his Uncle also nixes that idea (as Luke leaves the dinner table, in a huff, Owens wife, Beru, tells him that Luke has to much of his father's spirit in him. Owen's reply, \\"That's what I'm afraid of.\\").<br /><br />But, Artoo has other plans. Insistent on delivering the message to Obi-Wan, Artoo ditches Threepio, while Luke & his family are at dinner, & goes searching for the Jedi Knight himself. Upon this discovery, Luke sets out early the following morning, with Threepio, & unknowingly sets his destiny to become a Jedi Knight into motion.<br /><br />\\"Star Wars\\" is the first film to be released, but, is Episode IV, chronilogically in the overall saga. Thanks to the monsterous success of this film, the rest of the saga was a go. \\"Star Wars\\" was first created as a stand alone film (in case it flopped at the box-office). With its first re-release, the film then had the \\"Episode IV, A New Hope\\" moniker attached to the opening prologue. Nominated for 11 Oscars (winner of 8).<br /><br />Over the past 28 years:<br /><br />\\"Star Wars\\" has been re-released 7 times (including the Special Edition release) in theaters, & released on video 7 times (including the 2004 DVD release, a repricing in the late 80's, & a repackage (very badly) in the early 90's ). I've seen a very early rental copy of \\"Star Wars\\", with a plastic clamshell box that says \\"for rental only\\" at the bottom of the box from 1983, go for sale on e-bay, a few years back, for roughly 250 to 300 bucks. Thats a rarity.<br /><br />Differences over the years:<br /><br />The film had different audio tracks according to the film's format in theatre's (two types of formats were used in the original release, 35 mm & 70 mm. The 35 mm tracks were recorded first for national distribution while the 70 mm tracks were recorded for special releases. Rumor has it that these tracks weren't finished until the morning of the film's release).<br /><br />In 1997, the original trilogy was released in theatres as Special Edition's. the negative for \\"Star Wars\\" was cleaned up with a few new scenes added among them:<br /><br />The Stormtrooper squad that finds the droids escape pod is a lot bigger than in the original release. Overall, nice effect that either way doesn't kill the film.<br /><br />Mos Eisley spaceport gets a big redo. Instead of the hole in the ground from the original release, here its a big spaceport complete with ships taking off & all sorts of new scum & villainy walking the streets. Overall, this was always Lucas' vision, but, again, due to time & budget back in the day he had to make due with what he had. Still, he didn't need to take out the werewolf creature from the cantina.<br /><br />During the confrontation between Greedo & Han Solo, Greedo shoots first while the original shot of Solo firing is now a retaliation shot. The most absolute damning thing George Lucas has done to the moviegoing public (that includes \\"Howard The Duck\\"). This basiclaly destroys some of Han Solo's character. This guy doesn't take s*it from anybody. But, with the tinkering of this shot, its now just in self-defense. It sucks anyway you look at it.<br /><br />Jabba The Hutt makes an appearance (he was originally supposed to be in the film, but, due to budget & money constraints in 1976, he could never be fully realized). A fully grown Boba Fett is also present in the background setting up his bigger role in \\"Empire\\". Overall, cool effect & the scene was always meant to be there. But, Jabba looks a bit odd & doesn't look like the Jabba from \\"Return Of The Jedi\\".<br /><br />Han Solo is chased by battalions of Stormtrooopers instead of five. Overall, funny effect, but, so was the original.<br /><br />Certain dogfight scenes were replaced with CGI substitues to make the battle's more tight & fast. Overall, needed in spots & the battle is now more of a grand scale assault.<br /><br />A new scene between Luke & his friend Biggs Darklighter has been added before the space battle at the climax of the film. Note: a line about Luke's father is cut. As Red Leader is about to speak to Luke & Biggs a crewman walks in front of the camera with Red Leader, saying \\"You'll do all right.\\" The correct line is \\"If your as good a pilot as your father was, You'll do all right.\\" Overall, nice scene that lets the viewer in on a little bit of the friendship between Luke & Biggs before his death.<br /><br />For the 2004 DVD release:<br /><br />A new Jabba The Hutt takes the place of the old. Overall, needed. The new Jabba looks more like the \\"Jedi\\" Jabba, and is better for it.<br /><br />A 27 year old film gaffe is finally fixed. If you have an old VHS copy of the film, fast forward to the scene where just after Darth Vader cuts down Obi-Wan Kenobi, notice when the big metal doors close, take a careful notice to the color of Vader's lightsabre. Its rotoscope white, not the trademark red. That has finally been fixed. The other gaffe's haven't.<br /><br />The audio seems a bit off. Whenever Vader speaks, his breathing takes a backseat while his voice is less synthsizory & has more tamber to it. John Williams' classic scoreis less booming in some scenes & I find that a real problem.<br /><br />As for this third release for \\"Star Wars\\", Fox & Lucasfilm have included the original 1977 release as bonus disc material for the second disc.<br /><br />Video: the transfer is from the 1993 laserdisc transfer for The Definitive Editon box set. Scope ratio 2.35:1 & the transfer isn't that bad. There is grain (I expected that) & some dirt, but the image is quite sharp (I've seen worse on one of the early VHS releases to \\"Star Wars\\"). The color rendition is a lot better than the sickly color hue from the 2004 edition.<br /><br />Audio: 2.0 Dolby Digital. There is a strong prescence from the front speakers while the surrounds emphasize John Williams' legendary score.<br /><br />In all honesty, this isn't a half bad release, but, this isn't the final release to \\"Star Wars\\" on video. With the 30th anniversary to the original \\"Star Wars\\" looming on the horizen one wonders what the future holds for the \\"Star Wars\\" saga.shot, its now just in self-defense.
