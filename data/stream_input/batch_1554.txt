030758836X|4.0|Based on what I had heard about the book, I guess I knew that I had to be wary from the start. It is clear from the onset that someone or everyone is lying. But who? And what about? Coupled with vivid writing, clever metaphors and the author's acute awareness of cliché, I liked both the \\"insight\\" into the minds of the characters and the whodunit aspect of the book. Gillian Flynn herself manipulates the reader, mirroring her perversely flawed characters. Overall, I felt that the book deserved 4.5 stars. This loss of star was only because the author set a rather high bar on her intelligent prose in the first section that seemed to slip as the book moved on to subsequent sections. Other than this minor literary quibble and some loose ends here and there, Gone Girl is a classic page turner and a terrific read. I was hooked from page 1 and often stayed up late to find out what happened next, embarking on little treasure hunts for clues in the writing.
0817439390|5.0|I recently bought my first dslr (Nikon D5100) and wanted to learn the basics of photography without having to take classes. This book was recommended to me by a family member who does photography and I am so glad I bought it. This book is not only informative, but fun to read, and has wonderful pictures. I especially like how the author included the camera settings with each photograph. This book has certainly given me the courage to go manual and get creative with the other settings. To those also starting out like me, I would certainly recommend getting this book in addition to Scott Kelby's Digital Photography Vol. 1 also found on Amazon
B000SFD21Q|3.0|I expected more from this book than it delivers. It's not that the message it contains is not important and useful, but it is not that complex that it needs to be stretched out over a book when it could easily have fit in an article of reasonable length.
B001AJ09JW|3.0|This was better than 'House On Haunted Hill' and '13 Ghosts'!<br />I liked it but didn't love it!<br />What I liked about was:<br />1. This movie (for the most part) had a plot to it!'<br />2. Each character served a good purpose!<br />3. The actors were good!<br />4. The plot had some mystery to it!<br />5. It was not as gory as the last two movies!<br />6. I loved that song from 'Mudvayne': Not Falling!<br />7. The ship was pretty spooky!<br /><br />What I didn't like was:<br />1. The opening death scene after the opening credits was<br />a little over-the-top!<br />2. Why is the little girl 'Katie's' body still there but every<br />other body gone?<br />3. The pace to the movie was a bit too choppy at times!<br /><br />Over-all: Not a bad movie at all! Good for Halloween or any<br />kind of horror movie fan!<br />My grade: B- or three stars!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this app! All the sounds are very soothing to the mind and takes away all my stress. I swear I've been in a better mood by listening to it before I go to bed! Oh and one more thing......... IT'S SO WORTH IT!!!!!!GET THIS APP NOW!!!!
B004H51706|5.0|My 3-year-old son loves his new truck. It is made exceptionally well...the tires are actual rubber. The back tire comes off. The stearing wheel actually moves the wheels. You can open all the doors and put little people inside. Very impressed!

B007MU85D0|5.0|I first heard their song Love,Love,Love on Pandora and I enjoyed it so much that I built a station around the band. That's my favorite station now, it's never disappointing. Seriously, buy this album if you are a fan of melodic folky tunes.<br /><br />***Update***<br />It's popular on the radio now, who called it? I'll tell ya' who, this one.
030758836X|5.0|I ripped through this book so fast- I could not put it down. I even put my hand over the page on the right side to keep my eyes from straying over! I read it as I brushed my teeth, as I stirred our dinner...when one reads a lot, one can usually see the formula and figure out what is next. Not so with this one. I loved all the twists and turns...right to the last page. Highly recommended for a suspenseful but not gory, explicit read.
B000E0LB8G|5.0|This period-performance style set of Beethoven concertos seems to divide opinions. Some complain about the feeble and thin sound of the recording, while to some it seems to represent the ultimate statement about recording Ludwig van's concertos for the piano using authentic instruments. Well, to this listener, the sound is not a problem. Concertos 1 and 2 may need revving up the volume level a little, but this is mainly because of the replica of the Walter fortepiano used in these concertos has a somewhat thinner and more tinkly sound than the other two pianos used for concertos 3, 4 and 5. Also, occasionally the fortepiano sounds unpleasantly clangy. It sounds as if the microphone had been placed inside the piano, or too close to the machinery, so as to record all sorts of noises that come from the piano as it is being played. This concerns most the \\"Moonlight\\" piano sonata that closes CD 1, and the first movement of the \\"Pathetique\\" sonata on CD 2. I can only conclude that by the time of this recording, Decca just had not mastered the ideal placement of the microphones as regards this specific instrument. On the other hand, the sonatas are not the beef here - the concertos are - and these are very well performed indeed.<br /><br />So my complaints end here. Because the rest is just splendid. I have heard many modern recordings of the concertos 3, 4 and 5, but I can frankly say that I have never heard these concertos performed better than here. The third is very fine indeed, but concertos 4 and 5 seem to be absolute tops. There's an ideal balance between the soloist and orchestra, the orchestral colours are ravishing, and the performers play the concertos with conviction. For those who think that these last and greatest of Beethoven's concertos need a full-sized modern orchestra and a modern piano to be realized fully, that is simply not true, and that becomes quite apparent when you listen to these recordings. In fact, they perfectly illustrate the principle, useful in many areas, that \\"less is more\\". There is certainly enough power in this orchestra to act as the perfect accompaniment to Steven Lubin's fortepiano in these performances, and really, come to think of it, how could it be otherwise, as it is exactly the size of the orchestra Beethoven had in mind when he composed the concertos. It is not so much that you need great forces to perform this music successfully, but that you use those forces that you have in your disposal with great skill. And great skill is what these players - The Academy of Ancient Music led by Christopher Hogwood - have in galore. In fact, there is more adrenaline here than in many recordings with a full-sized orchestra.<br /><br />The Emperor concerto (no. 5) heard on this recording is easily my favourite version of all time; it is nearly as perfect as you can get. As Steven Lubin used three different fortepianos in these concertos and sonatas, to reflect the development of the instrument during Beethoven's time, the slight sound problem I mentioned earlier is less and less of a problem as you listen through the whole set - and it seems that the Decca engineers finally solved the balance problem after all. In all, this is as fine a recital of the Beethoven concertos on period instruments as you are likely to get - but do get a set played on a modern piano as well, just for the sake of comparison.<br /><br />The sound is crisp, clear, and detailed. Listening to these works, I have the feeling that I'm closer to Beethoven and what he intended than when listening to most other recordings.ul in many areas, that \\"less is more\\".

B004P7CN7W|5.0|Found this little Gem to add to my collection of sci movies.. was nice to see it at a more than fair price and arrived in perfect condition. Already watched it twice!.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|played this game initially and disregarded it. tried it again a week ago AND can't put it down now. lots of fun with increasing difficulty.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Its amazing, I love it, I can check on something I left running and stop and start anything I so choose
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I was upset about the update until I actually downloaded the update.  Yes I was disappointed that I lost most of the games I had won, but then I remembered what fun I had winning those games, and now I can to it all over again<br />  yeah!!!!!!!
B008M36ER0|5.0|I saw this movie got good reviews on IMDB, so I thought I would give it a chance. I am very happy I did, this movie was AWESOME!  Mel Gibson is so wheels off, he is perfect and believable for this part!  I would definatly purchase this movie again!
B0026IUXO2|5.0|Elizabeth the First was one of the most incredible monarchs in history. She loved her country and her people, and inherited the throne as a young woman at a time when England was dead broke, and only significant in that the rest of Europe was waiting to see whether it would be annexed by France, or Spain.<br /><br />Cate Blanchett does a masterful job of showing young Elizabeth as both a young woman, human, and also a brilliant strategist in the making.<br /><br />The movie is rounded out by a fabulous supporting cast, a great script by Michael Hirst, and delightful camera angles by director Shekhar Kapur.<br /><br />If you love history or just a good story this is a movie worth watching again and again, and will leave you wanting to know more about this fascinating individual who had such a profound effect on the future of England, and in many ways all of the West as we know it today.
0345803507|5.0|I read all three of these books and they were everything I had heard and more. These books have a great story with lots of extras!!! I have recommended them to all my friends, my mother and my aunts. They are the best I've read in years. I read them in a few days and will read them again. However, my advice is to read slow and enjoy them, because when it's done you will miss it. Hopefully E.L. James will continue on with the story!
B002JT69NC|5.0|A seemingly regular and quiet town suddenly gets turned upside down when high school students believe something has taken the place of their teachers and authority figures. Perhaps this could be because everyone starts acting the complete opposite of their usual selves, like how how quiet teacher named Elizabeth Burke (Famke Janssen, \\"X-Men\\" & \\"Taken\\") confronts a bullying student in a way that probably most red blooded american males would love.<br /><br />The opening sequences do set the stage for this eventual take over/possession of the various faculty members and the students have to fight back and find a way to turn back this invasion before they expand outside of their town. For being a typical teen horror flick it does have some funny lines, good punch and decent if not hokey suspense. The alien revealing/attack sequences are good if not silly and ridiculous a lot of the time, but at least fun.<br /><br />The cast for being back in 1998 features some good talent, like Clea Duvall (\\"The Grudge\\"), Jordana Brewster (\\"The Fast & the Furious\\"), Josh Hartnett (\\"30 Days of Night\\"), Salma Hayek (\\"From Dusk Til Dawn\\"), Elijah Wood (The \\"Lord of the Rings\\" Trilogy), Robert Patrick (\\"Terminator 2: Judgement Day\\") even Jon Stewart (\\"The Daily Show with Jon Stewart\\").<br /><br />So the cast does lend some cool punch to the script which is fairly basic but again its a fun movie, its not anything Oscar winning nor was it ever meant to be, just fun. *** out of 4 stars.

B00005RHGK|5.0|Two young people, Patricia Jenner (Gina Philips) and Darry Jenner (Justin Long, \\"Live Free or Die Hard\\") are out driving in the country when a big ol' black painted delivery truck barrels up behind them, runs them off the road then just speeds away. The kids investigate and see a man in a long coat and big hat dumping something down a drain, after going down said drain they discover a multitude of bodies and from then on it seems as if they are being targeted and after a few run-ins with the tall figure its clear he wants something from them but what?<br /><br />Patricia & Darry find out from a local woman that this figure is called \\"The Creeper\\", who wakes up every 23 years and for 23 days he gets to eat. What does he eat? Well people of course, or at least the parts of people he needs to stay alive and heal. So both brother and sister must try to avoid becoming a victim of the creeper and kill him if they can.<br /><br />The story is simple, the acting is basic, the action is fun and the cliches are abound but for some unknown reason this is one fun horror flick. The \\"creeper\\" is a very effective monster as he just kills for the sake of killing to get what he wants and there's a great scene where Patricia & Darry run the monster over a few times, of course it doesn't end up killing him, or it wouldn't be a very good creature would it?<br /><br />I really enjoyed this one and while nothing grand its well done and pretty creepy in parts. ***1/2 out of 4 stars.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Just finished book III. So much has been said about this book and to be honest, first time I had a look at the story I thought \\"brrrr crap\\"... but you know you shouldn't criticize what you don't know... so armed with my best \\"critics suit\\" I bought the first Fifty shades of grey.<br /><br />\\"I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN\\" all 3 books were read in 5 days in a working week (and yes I work from 8 am till 7pm) so not much sleep lately. Ok go figure that one out<br /><br />Is it an amazing work of literary fiction? Of course not... am I'm mesmerized by the quality of the writing? Dah... nooooo.  Many say it is the sex... hmmm not really... after a while you just want to go through those pages fast because it is more of the same... he screams her name she has an orgasm... and this is the recipe throughout the 3 books...  ok of course the parts where the butt plug is used and more kinky stuff is used those are a bit more entertaining but still... next question is: why did you read the books then. To be completely honest I don't know...  did I like it? I loved it...<br /><br />Would I buy a 4th volume if there were one? Hell yeah... sometimes you just want to read a happy ending... and feel a light heart... that's all.
B0006L0LOS|1.0|So a young woman named Patience Philips (Halle Berry, \\"Monster's Ball\\") is working for a cosmetic company and doesn't lead a very interesting life in all honestly. Well one night she overhears something she shouldn't where her boss (Sharon Stone, \\"Basic Instinct\\") is talking about how she doesn't care about the effects her products have on society cause she's making tons of money off of the suckers who buy them. Apparently people get sick and or just die after they stop using said products, well after Patience is discovered having heard this she is promptly disposed of but doesn't die thanks to a bunch of cats who save her.<br /><br />Thus Catwoman is born, well after some scenes of Patience not wanting to accept what has happened to her, but she does quickly realize she is totally different and a better person for it. She falls for a cop (Benjamin Bratt, TV's \\"Law & Order\\") who is on the trail of the deaths of women who have used these make-up products and she tempts him to fall for her by playing a game basketball while some hip-hop song plays (totally silly scene mind you).<br /><br />The action is quite ridiculous, the writing is well just horrid and any of the big name stars are totally mis-used here, Stone seems to really phone it in especially in the final few scenes when it comes to her line delivery. Yes its not meant to be a high class film, but this isn't even good on a cheesy level. It actually hurt me to watch this. 1/2 out of 4 stars.
B000002J1M|5.0|With the incomparable \\"Supper's Ready\\" taking up almost all of side two (yes, I'm still an LP man at heart!), this is the band's best.  Phil's drumming in \\"9/8 Time\\" is impressive and the band is a BAND throughout. Highly recommended.
B006LSZECO|5.0|If you liked War of the Roses, which was nothing like the silly movie made from it, you will be drawn into this book and captivated by its characters, who grow darker and darker as the story unfolds.  I don't want to disclose any plot lines because the author leads us down what appears to be a straight path until we realize that we have been lost in a maze and now, what is real?  What isn't?  Not only is this the best book that I have read in a long time because of a well-executed plot, but the prose is intelligent, revealing strong engaging characters.  Enjoy!
0307744434|5.0|This is not a drama, it is a sensory experience. The author stretches her creativity and your imagination to take you through a lightly plotted story. In it essence this is about two sorcerers upstaging one another with their creative endeavors, with interplay between them as they work contentiously and yet together to please and mystify the world at large.<br /><br />It is not high fantasy or urban fantasy, it is true-blue magical realism, like Howl's Moving Castle. The drama is subdued, the pace is subdued, and there is just about no action. But there is a cerebral element, in the magic and in getting to know the characters; the element of mystery and suspense never fully fades, and if the plot is a bit predictable, still the reader never knows what she will see beyond the next corner. It is a non-traditional story, and says as much within its own pages. Try it. Not all people enjoy a new flavor, but you won't know until you take the chance.

B001ILFUD2|5.0|The case is in  almost perfect condition. The disc was questionable, needed to play it first to know for sure. It did not look not too bad, just wanted to be sure. The questionable area was mostly in the center. Can't explain the center on the playing side.It had a hair line scratch but it was really close to center, on playing side. However, I was told it was in good condition and that it is. It plays fine. No skipping. Audio matches mouth movement. I am very happy with what I paid for. Happy I did not have to wait two weeks either. They gave a helpful description, which helped my decision. It was packed well too. Thank you.
B007P06DOK|5.0|I have really enjoyed getting reacquainted with this album.  The sound is superb.  Vocals are clear, distinct, and not edgy.  Percussion is sharp and real.  The bass is clean and not boomy.  Best of all, though, are the songs.  During my recent listenings I took the time to read all of the liner notes.  They helped me gain a new appreciation for this music.  I also enjoyed the interview with Paul Simon about the making of Graceland.  Why did I wait so long to re-connect with this music?  I love it.
B006RUJST6|4.0|After reading several of the reviews for Slammed I decided to take a chance and download it.  I'm So glad I did!  From the beginning of the book I couldn't help but feel sorry for the characters and what both families had gone through. There were some surprises in the book that had me turning the pages quickly wondering what was going to happen next. This book is truly heartwarming.
B00005JLF5|5.0|I was told that the Cardassians play an integral role in the development of Deep Space Nine, but once I watched the initial episodes, I realized that Kim was nowhere to be found.<br /><br />But, seriously: Great series. Perhaps the best Star Trek. Well worth watching.
0761169253|5.0|Initially, the cover and the title is what grabbed my attention. After a simple skimming of and the modestly affordable price i had to have this book. Mr. Kleon certainly created a work of art with this fantastic read. The quotes range from a diverse sample of artists such as Mark Twain and Franz Kafta to Questlove and RZA. He states that nothing is original everything is a remix. He used an example of genetics which as a biologist in training i loved. To illustrate his remix theory he used the reader. The reader is a blend of their mother and father, not a brand new concept but a remix. This fascinating read has definately breathed new life into my creativity as an artist. Kloen has a bright future ahead of him and i look forward to seeing him grow as an artist. I recommend this book to everyone since we are all artists, we create works of art, help stimulate your creativity you wont regret it.
B005LAIGW8|1.0|I was an avid fan of the early Ghost Rider comics when I was growing up in the 70s. I love the character. Still do.<br /><br />I'm not a Nick Cage hater. Sure, he's had some dogs, but how can you hate a guy who gave us \\"[[ASIN:6305499128 Raising Arizona]]\\"? And he's had some other decent movies; I thought AirCon was fun, Face Off was good, and I liked the National Treasure movies.<br /><br />Having said that, there is NO WAY I could recommend this movie to anyone!! I don't think I've EVER seen a worse movie. And it wasn't even one of those \\"so bad it's good\\" movies (a la \\"[[ASIN:B000AQ69P4 Alien Apocalypse]]\\"). This thing was just straight out B-A-D. I thought the first GR movie was fair; I liked the effects and, even with all the \\"I'm looking down my arm at you while I'm pointing dramatically\\" scenes, it wasn't Cage's worse performance. He saved that for the sequel.<br /><br />Please, if you really MUST waste two hours of your life, do it watching something else. Anything else. Heck, even though I've never seen it, I'd bet the \\"[[ASIN:B0009A409S Man-Thing]]\\" movie probably wasn't even this bad. (That's one of my all-time favorite Marvel characters and it's killing me not to watch the movie, but I've just heard so many bad things that I can't bring myself to see it. But if anyone ever threatens to make me watch \\"Ghost Rider 2\\" again, I'll probably ask for \\"Man-Thing\\" as a reprieve.) I'd almost be willing to watch the Steve Martin/Laura Dern fiasco \\"Novacaine\\" again before I'd watch this piece of garbage. (Ouch, it hurt just to say that. I still can't see how Martin and Dern ever agreed to make that piece of... <shudder>. Have to go find my happy place now.)
0307463745|5.0|I read this book in just a few couple hours, not simply due to the endless supplies of pictures and small chapters but because i found it to be such an enjoyable read. I picked this up because the cover interested me, then i saw that 37signals wrote it and bought it immediately. It also helps to have the respected Seth Godins praise on the cover. Alot of these principals can be used outside of the business arena, especially in the realm of creativity. I really enjoyed that these guys set sail against the winds of whats standard practice in business, and have flourished. Now they take their secrets and dispense it to the public, because even if you copy their principals you wont be 37signals you'll be a cheap knock off. I recommend this book for anyone interested in starting their own business or simply for the independent thinker always on the prowl for more knowledge. Looking forward to more from this company.

B001N1DPDE|5.0|I like to do my research before buying something. I saw all the reviews on this knife which were great and the fact that it is made in USA was the closer for me. This thing is big, solid, and ready for anything. Might be a little too big for some, and you probably don't need something this size for 1-2 day camping. However if you plan to head into the woods for a good period of time this would be the one I would take.

B0086O4FLC|5.0|I like Pat well enough to buy every release, but it's been a while I recalled why with so much glee. Pat has managed to take his 80's sound into the 2012. The melodies, the feel is there but Mayes is replaces by hot classic jazz tones with touches of Pat's synth guitar on a few selections.  While I've enjoyed some of recent releases I have to say this is the best Pat without Mehldau (whom I am a big fan of) since the early 90's. Very happy to hear Pat playing just pure music with joy and with a band that is as every good as he is.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Best book I've read in a while.  Great story, great characters, and very well written.  Can't wait for the next one.

B004U8VUUC|5.0|Enjoyed this movie very much.  Kirsten Dunst did an awesome job.  I was pleasantly surprised with all of the twists and turns in the movie which kept me on the edge of my seat.
0763644765|5.0|It is such a cute book! Bought it for my daughter when she was 20 months old so she could get used to be read about using the potty. We would read it lots of times. Now that she is 25 months old she is more interested in going to the bathroom and this book really makes her excited about potty training. She loves the faces in the book, the \\"you did it\\" and parents in the books saying \\"Hooray\\" in the end. So whenever she goes to the bathroom we do the same (you did it, and hooray...) and it is really helping her get to the point we want!!!

B000B8QEZG|5.0|Confessions On A DanceFloor is one of the greatest pop records of all time! If you like pop or dance music, you will love this album! Every song on Confessions is irresistibly catchy. Confessions is perhaps the most creative dance album ever made.

0380730405|5.0|The new Mrs. Max De Winter (who shall remain nameless) can't wait to begin her life as a young bride and newcomer to the renowned Manderley mansion on the Cornish coast.  When she arrives she is put off by the housekeeper Mrs. Danvers, who is still devoted to Max's deceased first wife, Rebecca.<br /><br />If you visit the mansion of Manderley you will not find Rebecca there.  You will find her spirit as she roams the hall and haunts the walls.  The second Mrs. De Winter walks in Rebecca's shadow as she gets to know her husband and her surroundings.  Rebecca and Mrs. De Winter are opposites, one shy and quiet, the other talkative and vivacious.  Of course, the current wife feels she pales in comparison to the first.  Evil is lurking in unexpected places as the house tries to keep its secrets and Mrs. De Winter is being pushed to her limit.<br /><br /> Reading Rebecca for the first time is a unique and satisfying experience.  The reader reaches a point in the book of shocked contentment and the book becomes an unstoppable page turner where you just aren't sure what will happen next.  De Maurier does an excellent job of setting up the mystery, the suspense and the romance and when combined with a house that is a formidable character and with the nervousness of the nameless narrator, you have a winning combination.  Rebecca will make the reader want to stay up all night reading under a blanket, holding a flashlight.<br /><br />Rebecca is a timeless Gothic masterpiece.  From the first famous sentence, \\"Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley again.\\", to its last, Rebecca is unforgettable.  A book to read again and again.

B005LAIIRQ|1.0|There is no purpose of the movie at all. It's obvious that when a flight crashes in such a place everyone will die. The movie doesn't show how exactly the characters feel in that situation, it's just that the wolves keep coming and kill one by one and the characters keep running away from them.<br /><br />Oh also, they could have just collected the metal derbies of the flight and could have covered up the opening so that the wolves won't have chance to attack them and also they would have been a lot warmer.<br /><br />This movie is for those who wants to die, where this movie explains you shouldn't die by yourself but you're gonna die eventually anyway.<br /><br />And use of the F word is countless.<br /><br />I wonder what the director wanted to say through this movie. It was a total BS where the wolves are the heroes.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|I am a average movie watcher. I have seen all the Nolan trilogy and I thought this one was the best. Usually when a movie is about 2 hours long i get a bit antsy in my seat but having a movie that was almost 3 hours long i thouht for sure i was going to have to take jogs around the theater and stretch, but that was not the case i was engaged emotionaly and physicaly in this movie. My eyes were glued to the screen waiting to what happened next. If you love Batman, action movies or just love a good movie, see this you wont regret it. I cant say it was the best movie of the year( Because the Hobbit is still coming out later this year) but i can say it is the best movie of the year so far. What does a 5 out of 5 stars mean for this movie? RISE
B006LSZECO|4.0|I read this book after seeing a press release that said Reese Witherspoon bought the film rights.The writing was flawless, imaginative, with twists and turns. I totally saw Reese as the wife up until  midway when the story did a complete 180 degree turn. Normally when I finish a good book, I miss the characters. flaws and all, at least one of the characters. Here I didn't miss anyone and was so glad when the book ended. This was a despicable cast of characters who liked to play dirty.  I hope Reese only produces and doesn't star.
B008D36INE|2.0|The dreariness of this movie made us want to take some pills and turn on the gas.  We can't believe we watched it to the end! This was, yes I said was, our date night movie, a real mood enhancer, pass the bottle of pills!
B0063IH60K|5.0|love it!!! better than any other solitaire game I found!!<br /><br />suggest you download it immediately.  its the best of the best
B006LSZECO|4.0|The journal style of writing is somewhat more tedious<br />than coventional prose. Having said that, once you become comfortable with the style you begin to be absorbed by the story. It does start out slowly and then before you know it,\\"You are hooked and cannot turn the pages quickly enough to find out what the author is going to do next.I would recommend the book<br />however it tries your patience with the two central characters
B0086700CM|5.0|This is the best game ever but it is sort of glitchy on the kindle fire. The game seams a bit harder on the kindle tire.
B008BM9L72|5.0|FANTASTIC BUY! best purchase yet! Glad I had all the books so I could keep reading as soon as I finished one! :)
B004M5BZS0|2.0|Be forewarned...although this is cheap way to get their last 3 albums, the sound quality is very poor....does not sound remastered!!
B003YFIUW8|5.0|I don`t know what people where talking about when they said this book was just &#34;okay&#34;. I could not put this book down!!!! The story of a young boy and his mother escaping from such a weird situation is just captivating. I`ve never read anything like it and am hoping that other people read the book before deciding on whether or not to read it just because some stupid people didn`t get this complex story.
B007P6VLRS|5.0|I have to admit I'm pleasantly surprised. I loved SP early in my music-listening days... high school and college. This isn't a weak \\"Old band releases 20th album\\" record. It's energetic early on, then a little more lilting and occasionally melancholy later on. But it's overall great end-to-end listening. One thing I have to say is, the percussion really carries this album. Just great. You have to listen through a couple times to really enjoy it but there's so much there. Other than the percussion it might be a little uninteresting.<br /><br />Pretty cool!
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|The whole trilogy is so very well written. I hated to finish the last book. We need more mystery/intrigue books like these.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|From the first page to the last this book holds your attention. The feelings and emotion of the character rise from the pages.  Her experiences and thoughts help relate to the character as she treks thru the trail.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great Book.  Love it so much more than the movie.  Totally recommend reading it :)  I was worried I wouldnt like it since im not a teenager but I still thought it was very entertaining.  Cant wait to read the rest of the series.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Enjoying the game A LOT. Higher levels are challenging. Adds to the fun. SO...I need 20 words huh? Am typing on kindle so is slow going.
B005LAIGN2|5.0|Another \\"winning\\" dvd from Amazon. The entire picture is action-packed and filmed in excellent color and a special soundtrack that surpasses most. Most exciting to watch. Praises to the Tuskagee Airmen!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I downloaded this a few days ago and I can't put it down. kept me entertained while I was homebound from work. the boards can be quick and are great for when you need to blow a few minutes, but would like to exercise your brain

0547564651|4.0|Paul Tough sets out to answer a rather heady question in a rather slim 200 pages: what makes children succeed? To his credit, Tough packs in a dense barrage of different perspectives (economic, social, psychological, and medical) and he supports his points well with ample research.  The resulting book is interesting reading and provides a great deal of food for thought.  I appreciate Tough's contribution, but I have to quibble with some of his conclusions.<br /><br />Tough begins his book talking about the rise of cognitive interventions in early childhood.  Ever since some studies showed some positive effects of various kinds of early childhood stimulation, parents have rushed to play Mozart for their developing fetuses, companies have marketed products guaranteed to get your baby reading, and competition for the \\"best\\" preschools has become a blood sport.  But Tough argues that these interventions, while well intentioned, are ultimately misguided.  While cognitive skills are certainly important, and early stimulation can boost these skills somewhat, there may be a different, over-arching set of skill which may be more important to overall success in life.  These skills are the non-cognitive skills commonly grouped under the rubric of \\"character\\".<br /><br />As Tough dives into the meat of his exploration, he opens with a look at the negative effects of poverty, its correlations with trauma and adverse childhood events (abuse, witnessing violence, neglect, malnutrition, etc.), and how these factors affect an individual through his life - cognitively, emotionally and even physically.  He explores attachment theory and the role of attachment in soothing and undoing the effects of early adverse events.  I found this chapter fascinating, as I have long felt that trauma is one of the root causes of so many societal problems.  If we could only figure out how to prevent and heal trauma, the gains - educational, creative, productive, social, etc. - would be astounding.  Tragically, it seems instead that we are hell-bent on increasing trauma, our increasingly violent movies, television and news media being but some examples thereof.  I had hoped that Tough would explore this area more in depth.<br /><br />Tough, however, swerves into a detour and begins building his argument for \\"character\\".  He acknowledges that there are many different definitions of \\"character\\" and disagreements about what should or shouldn't be included.  Some definitions include more religious/\\"moral\\" values such as chastity or piety, while others strive for more universal values such as honesty and integrity.  But what Tough seems to mean by \\"character\\" (although he himself does not always apply the term consistently) has to do with practical values that help people succeed:  the ability to work hard toward a goal and stick to it in the face of adversity and setbacks, the ability to rebound after failure, the inclination to do one's best even in the absence of obvious external rewards, the ability to delay gratification.<br /><br />Tough spends a good deal of time comparing and contrasting the KIPP charter school program with an elite, expensive private school in New York:  Riverdale Country School.  The schools are almost polar opposites demographically.  KIPP is a free, public, open-enrollment charter school which selects students by lottery.  The majority of the students are poor and minority.  Riverdale, by contrast, is highly selective and enrollment fees start at $38,000.  The student body is exclusively rich and nearly all white.<br /><br />But the two schools have very similar missions:  to prepare their students for college and give them the tools for success, including \\"character\\" tools (both programs define character in the wider sense of social values as well as Tough's characteristics).  The differences in demographics, however, mean that this mission is often carried out in very different ways.  Riverdale kids almost universally come from homes with two college educated professional parents, and their own college/professional destiny has been part of the air they've breathed since infancy.  KIPP students, by contrast, are not nearly as likely to have college educated parents and have not been prepared for college - in fact, many may be actively dissuaded from college and may have barriers in qualifying for, applying for, paying for and succeeding at college.<br /><br />In Tough's view, the challenge for the Riverdale students is often \\"character\\" issues, particularly those directly relating to success, such as grit, perseverance, and resilience.  They come from a secure safety net which they know will always be there.  They often find getting good grades and getting along with teachers easy, so they coast in school and don't develop the skills necessary to succeed.  The trick for them, Tough argues, is being allowed to fail and having to get back up on their own, but this is often inhibited by \\"helicopter\\" parents.<br /><br />KIPP students, on the other hand, have dealt with adversity and failure all their lives and have had to develop grit just to survive.  They may in this regard have an advantage over their Riverdale peers.  If students can be taught to develop and hone such skills, just like they're taught to develop reading and math skills, they may be able to narrow or even overcome the gap created by their deprived backgrounds and comparably poor prior education.<br /><br />Tough then expands these ideas by exploring other contexts and other programs, such as a chess club at a public school in New York and an after school program in Chicago which expanded to become a full in-school curriculum.  Many of these programs deliberately seek out not the highest achieving or the smartest students, but rather the struggling students who still seem to have some determination.  Using intensive, nearly all-encompassing catch-up methods which focus on emotional and \\"character\\" issues as well as cognitive skills, these programs attempt to bridge the gap between rich and poor students and give poor and minority students a greater chance to get into, succeed at and graduate from college.<br /><br />Tough lauds these programs for their efforts and their success, and, indeed, these programs have much to brag about.  College attendance and graduation rates are much higher among students with access to such programs than the general population.  But I think Tough overstates the effects just a bit.  Even with all this intensive effort, and even for all their grit and perseverance, the low income students still struggle more than and drop out more than their affluent counterparts, even with their apparent relative lack of grit.  Tough seems to be arguing that \\"character\\" matters more than anything else, but his own data shows that no amount of diligent application can make up for the advantage bestowed by affluence and a strong safety net.  Not that we shouldn't try to teach \\"character\\", but maybe we should also try to figure out how to expand that safety net.<br /><br />Another criticism I would make of Tough is his ready acceptance of big names and \\"recognized\\" leaders.  For instance, he hails Paul Vallas and Bill Gates as recognized educational leaders, despite the fact that neither holds an education degree, Vallas had no prior education experience before being appointed to Chicago Public Schools on the strength of his budget reform, and Gates has no education experience whatsoever.  (I question Arne Duncan's inclusion as an educational leader too, but, then, he is Secretary of Education.)  Actual education experts - those who have dedicated their lives to teaching and studying the effects of educational policy - have long been skeptical of charter school expansion and high-stakes testing espoused by all of the above.  In fact, Tough seems to accept charter schools and standardized testing with little question of their validity and effectiveness (although he does note that standardized testing measures intelligence and cognitive skills rather than actual achievement, which correlates better with non-cognitive skills as measured by, for instance, rote coding tests which measure perseverance and diligence).<br /><br />Finally, Tough stumbles into the classic \\"centrist\\" fallacy of false equivalence:<br /><br />\\"Finally, there is the fact that the new science of adversity, in all its complexity, presents a challenge to some deeply held political beliefs on both the left and the right.  To liberals, the science is saying that conservatives are correct on one very important point:  character matters.\\"<br /><br />No liberals are saying that character doesn't matter.  Furthermore, conservatives often define \\"character\\" along social values lines equivalent to \\"morality\\", which Tough himself rejects.  What liberals are saying is that it's not that easy.  You can't just throw a bunch of slogans at students and expect that they're magically going to change.  All of the programs Tough details in his book are intensive, wrap-around programs which provide near-immersion experience to help students catch-up both academically and socially/non-cognitively, yet still the gap is not eliminated and still the students struggle despite their best intentions.  You can't simply tell students to \\"man up\\" and force discipline into them and expect it to overcome the lifetime of trauma and adversity Tough himself details in his first chapter.  Education reform is not some easy, cheap package of \\"character\\" platitudes that we can bestow on disadvantaged \\"failing\\" students.  It's a matter of taking students where they're at, recognizing how they got there, and caring enough to invest the time and effort to help them move on.  Yes, character is a part of that.  But people succeed when they care about themselves, and they care about themselves when somebody cares about them.  Attachment, as Tough himself discovered, can overcome adversity and build resilience.  But if attachment isn't formed when a baby is tiny and cute and adorable, it's a lot harder to form attachment with the confused, angry teenager that that baby grows into.<br /><br />Tough is on the right track that it's about a whole lot more than just cognitive skills.  Plunking disadvantaged babies in front of Baby Einstein isn't going to cut it.  Tough is also right that \\"character\\" skills as he defines them:  grit, perseverance, resilience, etc. can help to bridge the gap left by deficits in early childhood stimulation, cognitive skill building, and general education, and that those \\"character\\" skills can be taught and learned.  But I think he needs to circle back around to his first chapter and explore more deeply the connections among trauma, deprivation, attachment and \\"character\\", and how those deficits can be healed and corrected.ese programs attempt to bridge the gap between rich and poor students and give poor and minority students a greater chance to get into, succeed at and graduate from college.<br /><br />Tough lauds these programs for their efforts and their success, and, indeed, these programs have much to brag about.

B003O86FMW|5.0|I've had my IPad for 18 months, and had only once before tried an E-book.  I got the 'Hunger Games', and hadn't finished it before I downloaded the other two books in the series.  I know the Hunger Games series was written  for teens, but adults can really appreciate its scathing indictment of our 'reality competition' and politically charged culture.
0345803485|5.0|I'm so obsessed with this book... I read it over and over ..I recommend this book to every adult who is into erotics and romance.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love the 'Hunger Games' trilogy, and applaud Suzanne Collins on a very thoughtful and entertaining book series.  As dystopian literature, this has to rank right up there among the best.
B0028R3NCU|5.0|I've had one of these for over three years, attached to my keychain where it gets plenty of abuse as my keys get thrown around, bang against it, and it still works! To give you some idea of the level of the abuse, all of the paint on the metal has worn off at this point,<br /><br />Though it is still working (I just used it a few minutes ago), after over three years of this abuse something on it did finally come loose: A few months ago the plastic cap that forms the side of the connector opposite the contacts came off (seems like it was probably just glued on), so I took some typical dollar store superglue and glued it back on. (Luckily I didn't lose it.)  After that it was back to normal with no awkward bits of glue or anything causing any problems. (I did make sure to clean off the contacts.) You wouldn't even be able to tell that it had ever come apart. It's not surprising that something would finally come off after over three years of scratching and banging, but it's unusual to be able to fix it so easily.<br /><br />I basically just use this as a thumb drive, keeping an old 2GB card in it all the time. The card has never accidentally come out after all this time. I practically never take the card out, and I don't really plug the reader into a computer very often as it basically just contains some stuff like system utilities and an encrypted password database which I hardly ever need. But when I have needed it to temporarily store files to bring home, etc, no problems at all.<br /><br />I seldom give anything 5 stars, but I'd give this thing more than 5 if I could. The thing has been incredibly durable and reliable, and it's so small that I never even notice that it's on my keychain until I need it. As a bonus, when used as a thumb drive, you can \\"upgrade\\" it by swapping out the MicroSD card for a larger one. Try that with a regular thumb drive.
1400069289|5.0|Great book.  Addictive.  Started reading it, and couldn't put it down. Get this book.  You'll learn a lot about marketing, research & development.  (That all sounds boring, but it isn't.)

B0013WJGJ0|1.0|After watching Nolan's series, I felt like I should give this one another shot, just to see if it really was as bad as I remembered.  It was every bit as bad as I remembered, and I know I'm in the minority here, but this is why I hate this movie:<br /><br />Michael Keaton is not the guy.  He doesn't pull off \\"billionaire playboy\\" AT ALL, and I just don't believe his motivation.<br /><br />Jack Nicholson's Joker is not scary.  He's a goofball, which is only half of the character.  Yeah he shoots people, but I'm never thinking, \\"wow, this guy is really off his rocker, in a creepy way.\\"<br /><br />Tim Burton's style is just not for me.  It's way over the top campy, and I just don't like it.<br /><br />Joker's plot was actually pretty good, but when they continually show the news reporters looking like crap because they won't use makeup, it comes off as more of a joke, and not a threat that I should be taking seriously.<br /><br />Also, sorry but this is inexcusable, \\"ever dance with the devil in the pale moonlight?\\"  \\"ever dance with the devil BY the pale moonlight?\\"  Is it \\"in\\" or \\"by\\"?  It's inconsistent.  If this is a line the Joker uses all the time, he should get it right every single time.  I know, I'm being picky, and it's easily explained, but it pulled me out of the moment, because I couldn't help but think that it was just lazy film-making.<br /><br />Gotham seems too claustrophobic.  Most of the scenes are shot close up, and you never truly get to see the grandeur of Gotham as a big, sprawling city.  Even as the Batwing flies through the city, it's whizzing close by buildings and you just feel trapped.<br /><br />Speaking of the Batwing, Batman flies up over the clouds and coincidentally lines up the Batwing with the moon.  Why?  That was just stupid and unnecessary, and it wasn't cool.  More attempts at style over substance that for me just didn't work.<br /><br />I much prefer the more realistic and gritty take that Christopher Nolan took on his series.  But that's just me.  I will never understand what people see in this movie.  Different strokes for different folks, I guess.ut that's just me.  I will never understand what people see in this movie.  Different strokes for different folks, I guess.

0226264211|5.0|I've read a few books from Friedman over the years and I really think this book ties together his stance of less government intervention. You can really get a sense of his passion through his ideas of expressing liberty. I absolutely love his questioning of what is considered a great quote from JFK. Friedman questions the role of govt and what it truly was built to do and not run your life for you. This book is less about economics (capitalism too) and more about liberty and freedom from government. In summary, a classic.

034580404X|1.0|Another entirely unconvincing romance series set in the Pacific Northwest.  I wish talentless authors would stop using our beautiful landscape as a character, she deserves so much better.<br /><br />Even if you edited out every single \\"oh my\\", \\"jeez\\", \\"what?\\", \\"holy sh*t!\\", and \\"wow\\"; even if the characters didn't constantly twist their mouths, gasp, glare, pull each other's hair, throw tantrums at the smallest provocation, bite their lip, or roll their eyes, this would still be a giant crap heap.  It's so bad it's distracting, completely takes you out of the \\"story\\". The sex scenes are...all right. Sex scenes are generally better when you give a deuce about the characters and don't have to stumble over terrible writing to get through them. I've read better Harlequin romance novels.<br /><br />Twilight fanfiction bom-chicka-bow-wow becomes a worldwide phenomenon; only in America.

0345522478|4.0|Ever read a novel where the main character is a druid?  Before an image of a white-robed Gandalf with a Lucky Charms accent pops into your head, please be aware:  This ain't your mother's druid (actually it's more like your great, great grandcestors' druid).  Kevin Hearne's Hounded is an urban fantasy novel set in modern-day Arizona.  Atticus O'Sullivan is an ancient druid who has maintained the look and health of a 21-year-old through his magic.  Trying to live a quiet life, he's been hounded (see the connection to the title???) by a Celtic god for centuries, and tries his best to avoid being killed or seriously wounded.  As you can expect, it's quite a challenge to stay incognito when the God of Love (ironical, I know) is trying to make mincemeat out of you.  Fortunately, Atticus has some arcane defenses up his sleeve (actually, around his neck) in the form of an iron necklace imbued with various magical protections.  That, along with advice from The Morrigan (A Gaelic, sexy version of the Grim Reaper), and his loyal Irish Wolfhound keep him from getting into deep trouble with the Pantheon of ancient Ireland.  Of course, despite Atticus' attempts at remaining hidden, Angus Og discovers the druid's whereabouts, and much conflict ensues.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  The story flows smoothly and is quite engaging, with bits of clever humor sprinkled throughout Atticus' first-person narrative.  If you're a fan of Jim Butcher's Harry Dresden series, you'll more than likely take great pleasure in reading Hearne's novel.  As a side note, the author provides a pronunciation list for the numerous Celtic names introduced in the story.  I'm one of those people who try to pronounce words correctly, so I found myself frequently flipping back to the pronunciation key whenever a new Gaelic proper noun was staring me in the face.  Needless to say, I'm glad I purchased this book in its physical form rather than as an e-book; have you tried flipping back to a specific page on those e-readers?  Ugh!<br />Treat yourself to a fun and gripping urban fantasy, and learn a thing or two about Celtic mythology while you're at it.  Get ahold of this book ASAP.  Slan go foil!
0307730697|5.0|Adam Brown's life made history. He was an amazing example of a man who overcame his past, loved God and his family and sacrificed for our freedom. This book is his story! A story of how he lived - FEARLESS! He was ready to meet his Creator. Adam did not think of himself as a hero, but to his family, friends and country he was, not only a hero, but much, much more. His testimony was outstanding. This is the story of an ordinary man, living in an extraordinary way. It tells the story of a fun loving country boy, who never broke a promise; to the downward spiral after high school that landed him in jail. Finding his faith and achieving his goal to become the best Navy Seal. His courage and bravery led to ultimate sacrifice.<br /><br />This book is a well written tale of Adam's life - A life that needed to be shared to give encouragement to others. The author did a great job of portraying Adam - his commitment to family, God and country. He wasn't perfect but God used him an a mighty way.  His life will continue to touch others. When you read this book you will laugh, cry, and feel a part of this family. It is truly an amazing read! Great book to share with anyone who may be in the military or know someone who is serving our country.<br /><br />*I received this book from Blogging for Books program for the purpose of my review.*

Also, I felt that the dancing was as Professional and Addicting as much as it was in 'Dirty Dancing.' The Music in this movie was Breathtaking and the Acting Performance Excellent. The theme here is the Dancer's life. Emily arrives in Miami to fulfill her dream of becoming a professional dancer as she falls in love with Sean. Her soul-mate leads a dance crew called 'The Mob.' After The Mob's neighborhood is threatened, Emily, Sean, and The Mob join together to turn Performance Art into Protest Art as they risk losing their dreams to fight for a Greater cause. I had flashbacks about the Protest I viewed in 'West Side Story.' Even the Last Dance in 'Dirty Dancing' wasn't just symbolic of love, it was also a Protest dance to show the world how strong they believed as they united to send a message. Regardless of the reason for Protest in all 3 films, the Dancing and Acting was Sensational, Enjoyable, and Entertaining from start to finish. Highly Recommended!
B008EQHP4G|4.0|Sound of Noise is a a film about 6 drummers that decide to give a city an original and innovative concert using the everyday objects laying around; they're pursued by a tone-deaf policeman that hates music. Overall, it's a great film.<br /><br />What did I like? The music is the best part of the film. They use everything from bodies to bulldozers to create a unique sound. I laughed a couple of times during the music because of how bizarre and absurd it was. This music group goes to several location like a hospital and bank to play music which adds some variety to the film. The music is very unique and innovative and gives you a reason to bob your head or tap your foot. I also like the policeman and how everything the musicians played on was mute for him; it was a unique spin on the crime aspects of the film. The acting was also great. It's a very original movie, so it gets major points for that. You don't see many films get creative nowadays, and I appreciate that this film takes chances.<br /><br />What did I dislike? They have 4 main songs in this 1 hour 40 minute film, with a couple of smaller songs tossed into the mix. Consequently, I thought it was a little slow at times and the pacing was off. Also, I thought some of the characters were annoying, but the drummers weren't the only ones though, the other characters, like the professor at the academy, were also a little annoying. These are only minor issues to me, though, but they may bother others.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend Sound of Noise; I think film and music lovers will have a great time with it. As of 7/27/12, this film is available on Amazon Prime and Netflix Streaming.<br /><br />This film has a little blood and violence. And there is some nudity, but the bodies are painted.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game keeps you very intertained and always wanting more. this game is also very addicting because the more games you play the more new games you'll want to buy.
B003BH7R32|5.0|Holy crap! Kavinsky is awesome. I initially heard the song Nightcall in the movie Drive and immediately downloaded it that night. Now I play this song whenever I'm working out, driving, or doing anything else that I'd want to feel badass. For bonus points, chew on a toothpick.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|I was very curious about this because it was all the buzz.  I was very disappointed.  The writer has very limited descriptive powers, the same phrases over and over.  As hunky as Christian sounds, he seems to have only two moves albeit in different places. I must say that I learned a lot about kinky sex toys, thanks but I'll pass. A lot of sex, a lot but it seemed that it got to the point of same old, same old, moving right along. All this said, I did read all three because I hope it would end better - not so much.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|love this game. love seeing all the animals and making my on village.  and getting to decorate. with all fun and cute stuff. do recommend. this game lots of fun
034580404X|5.0|I heard multiple times that this trilogy was a must read, but sort of blew it off.. I wasn't one to jump on the Twilight bandwagon, & thought this was similar.. But I changed my mind & thought what the heck, why not.. Once I started, I was hooked.. I absolutely could not put this book down! I read all three books in less than a week. Now after finishing them all, I feel sort of lost without the story, & Mr. Grey of course haha.. I would with out a doubt recommend this trilogy to everyone.. & I have thus far, I tell all my friends they have to read it! Never in my life has a book had me so addicted! It was such a great, great story!!

B0064W652A|4.0|This is one of my favorite graphic novels ever.  Great art, great story.  4 stars for the product.<br /><br />This review is specifically about the Kindle edition.  Please note that although the iPad kindle app now supports graphic novels, much (if not all) of the DC material is Android-only.  In other words, if you were hoping to take advantage of the great Amazon.com prices, think again.  This is as of late July 2012.<br /><br />If you are not so sure, go ahead and buy the kindle edition and try to download it on your iPad.  If you get a 'Download Error', rush back to the 'Manage your Kindle' section and request a refund.  I was able to get a refund for this purchase, as well as 'All Star Superman' and 'Superman for All Seasons', a couple of my other favorites.

B00846REIS|2.0|I decided to try reading this after being very disappointed with the 3rd installment of 50 Shades of Grey.  This book was worse than the 50 book.  I forced myself to finish it, but I won't bother buying any of the sequels.

B008N1V11U|4.0|people need to understand what happened in Colorado has nothing to do with this game. Yes I do feel really bad for the ones who died but you cant blame gameloft for it. Just get the game if you want it, don't get it just becouse of what happened in Colorado.
0375703764|1.0|I read this a few years ago, after hearing about it over and over from other twentysomething readers. \\"Oh, you gotta read House of Leaves--it's super scary and experimental and original, and like every smart person ever really likes it.\\"<br /><br />Well, House of Leaves sucks. To begin with, it ain't scary. Not remotely. I suppose that's less a criticism of the book than it is of the people who talk about it, but it was nonetheless disappointing. I read it alone in a dark, drafty apartment in the Northwest in December, and I was not once scared. I slept like a baby.<br /><br />The characters are completely unmoving. There's the couple in the house. There are, like, problems and stuff in their relationship. Or something. There's the kid in LA. All I remember about him is that he seemed to have an improbable amount of freaky sex.<br /><br />Some people say the book is meant as a satire of academic criticism. If so, it's vague and toothless.<br /><br />The supposedly \\"experimental\\" typography and formatting is in fact nothing more than second-rate gimmickry. The font size shrinks as a character crawls through a tunnel. The words climb up and to the right of the page as a character ascends a staircase. There are other literary works that make use of conventions like these. They're called comic books, and they are for children.<br /><br />Don't waste your time or money with this book, and don't listen to you friends who tell you that you should. You're probably smarter than they are.
B005LAIGOQ|4.0|This is a scary movie be cause it is has some very disturbing scenes of children being influenced to kill themselves in some very horrendous ways. Daniel Radcliffe's performance is exceptional. He has to be on the screen for over Ninety<br />percent of the film. He plays Arthur Kipps a widower with a young son, who is played by Radcliffe's Godson Misha Handley.  This film boasts a fine cast of players Ciaran Hinds<br />who was in the last  \\"Potter\\" film; here plays a man who lives a little bit in denial about the happenings in the village near the old house on the moor. His wife is played by Janet McTeer. Mention should also be made of the chilling performance of Liz White who portrayed Jennet \\"The Woman in Black\\" There are really no bad performances in this movie at all. While the film relies on a few old horror film tricks to get a few scares out the the<br />audience it manages to tell the story quite effecively. The ending which is good and a little different I will not divulge. I will say that this is a film that parents or  others should watch first before letting younger Radcliffe fans view it.<br />It carries a PG 13 rating for a good reason.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I received my set on Apr 29, 2012 and this unit has served me well.<br />PROS:<br />-Excellent gaming surround sound.<br />-I am getting about 7 hours between charges.<br />-Range is as advertised, if not better.  Hadn't realized it until I was writing this review, but I had never taken the set to a point where it went out of range. Then again, I live in a one story bungalow.  None the less, the signal easily goes through these old plaster walls of mine without a drop.  For this review, I went to my basement to see if I would lose the signal.  I did, but that's about 50 feet, a closed kitchen door and a floor away.  They definately have the range specified.<br />-I am not an Audiophile, but I enjoy my music using this set (Listening to Supertamp \\"Crime of the Century\\" as I write this).  I do listen using them alot, but once again..I'm not an audiophile.  If you're not critiquing whether or not the latest remaster of your favorite album was an improvement, you will be A-OK with the 930.  I can hear no distortion (to me that means, it still sounds good) even with the bass maxed out in the software.<br />-Charge while using.  A BIG plus for me.  Just plug 'em in and keep on playing/listening while charging.  The wiring is quite lengthy.  The time between charges is so generous you WILL forget to charge them up at times.  No problem!!!  Just don't walk away with them hooked up!!!<br />- Comfortable.  Very light, but not \\"cheap.\\"  I wear eyglasses (you should have known that already...I'm listening to Supertramp...No spring chicken ya know).  Very comfortable during very long listening/gaming sessions.  This is not my first headset, but it is DEFINATELY the most comfortable.<br />- On set volume control wheel.  Very nice!!!  Large...easy to access.  Not like others I have owned that have you searching for that tiny thumb-wheel on the wiring.  This is a great feature.<br /><br />CONS:<br />- The on/off switch is hard to press.  Nit picking, and probably by design so it'snot accidently turned off.  Could be called a feature.<br /><br />Look.  I honestly tried and thought hard about \\"The CONS\\" and can't find anything beyond that.  I WANT to tell you the BAD in my opinion, but there is nothing I can think of beyond that...and again...I have used them for 3 months.<br />If they died tomorrow (God forbid), I would be unhappy, but I like them so much I would buy another pair hoping that the second pair would last.  I can't recommend them highly enough.<br /><br />I have the software installed, but only use it to see how much time is left on my charge.  I have fiddled around with the available equalizer/voice morph etc., but I just keep everything on the default settings.  The help files (online manual essentially) in the installed software are in depth and informative.<br /><br />I don't MMO so I can't review the microphone, other than to say that Microsoft Voice Recognition understands me unlike my ex-wife ;).  I have not programmed the keys and do not intend to.  None the less, for this review I used the pre-programmed keys to control Windows Media Player from a distance of about 30 feet and they were able to control the program without issue.<br /><br />Buy it.  Heck, if price is an issue, gamble on a refurbished one that is warrented if available.  These things are that good!!!!

B00846REIS|2.0|I read the 50 Shades trilogy and wanted to read more.  Based on the reviews, I read Bared to You.  It was just a rehash of 50 Shades, but with totally unrealistic sex scenes.  Who talks like that??  I'm no prude, but come on!!!! No pun intended.  While the writing was better, the storyline, characters, and narrative were all just too much of an attempt to be what 50 Shades is.  Save yourself the disappointment on this one...such a letdown.
1597801585|2.0|Basically, this novel reads all over the map--yet it's set in post apocalyptic Thai~land.  The characters seem distant; and naming the book \\"The Windup Girl\\" appears as an after thought.  As if the encompassing idea for the novel came very late in the writing/editing stage.  None of the characters hold attention because the author has introduced too many layers...be it layers of plot, characters, unclear groupings of good guys vs bad guys, layers of plot twists, ideas, and language.  Too much is going on while it becomes abundantly clear about halfway through that there actually is very little going on in the story.  This novel requires too much brain thought for the limited pay off.  Perhaps a more focused effort will become this author in the future!

0446582778|5.0|This is the 5th Harry Bosch Book - It stands alone, but is better read in sequence!<br /><br />In `Angels Flight' tough, weary, emotionally battered Los Angeles Police Department Detective Bosch is forced to take a case where he is bound to lose.<br /><br />He has to investigate the murder of a high-profile minority civil rights lawyer Howard Elias, who specialised in pursuing cases of police brutality. The main suspects in is murder are the police themselves. LA is tinder dry, angry, and ready to riot. The background of the story is a brutal and disturbing child murder, successfully solved by the police, and waiting to go to court. Howard Elias was acting for the accused, and claimed his client was both framed and tortured by the LAPD. Under pressure from different factions and interests in the LAPD Bosch is forced to question his friends and his enemies, their motives, their innocence or guilt.<br /><br />No doubt about it, Michael Connelly is very good. Connelly, a former police reporter for the Los Angeles Times paints a vivid and convincing picture of the stresses and strains, good and bad within the LAPD and the teeming conurbation of Los Angeles.  Five stars.
B008N1V11U|3.0|This game should be made free due to the fact gameloft is gaining profit from the recent events in Colorado,  which is wrong.  pray for those peoples family.  or else some guy dressed up as bane could stop by your local movie theater.
0307474712|3.0|By now you know what the unique story is behind \\"One Day\\"- it's a snapshot of the relationship of Dexter Mayhew and Emma Morley, taken every year on July 15th. By capturing \\"one day\\" out of each of their years together, David Nicholls creates a compelling portrait of the way two people connect as they grow and change through the years.<br /><br />The problem for me was that the book just LAUNCHES you into these characters' lives. I suppose Nicholls' intention is that the picture will be filled in as each year passes, but I never quite got over the discomfort of not really knowing the characters. It's sort of like having a long conversation with a stranger at a party and never knowing exactly who the heck you are talking to.<br /><br />Because of all the good reviews, and the unique approach to narrative, I'm compelled to give this one another try, maybe when I have time to devote to it instead of dipping in and out of it when I have a spare moment. But after my first read through, I just never connected with the book or the characters. I felt like my copy of the book was missing some crucial chapters from the very beginning.

B005LAIIRQ|2.0|*****SPOILERS******<br /><br />This would have been a much better movie if:<br /><br />1. They had set this in the 60s or 70s (even the 80s!) to make leaving the site of the plane wreck a semi-viable option. Saying they (the airline/authorities I assume) don't care about them so won't search for the wreck is just the first piece of the big pile of BS in this movie. They left shelter from the wind, a fuel source, and a supply of food (gross, I know, but all too true). Wolves would not have been a concern in the real world.<br /><br />2. Get rid of the unrealistic wolves. (In this day and age, the fake looking wolves are completely inexcusable!) A brief encounter with a wolf pack might have been believable, but no wolves are going to follow you like that. Or attack like that.(btw, a pack generally consists of a mated pair and offspring.) Read a real scientific book on wolf behavior before spouting nonsense in a movie, Hollywood. Heck, you can wiki more reliable info than they used here. I am also unsure of how the wolves cross the ravine later in the movie. Perhaps they briefly sprouted wings.<br /><br />3. No one gets in that kind of water at that time of year and makes it out. They would have been dead from the cold. It took all of ten seconds to look up that info. (two minutes in freezing water and you begin to lose the ability to even move)<br /><br />This could have been an awesome movie about facing death, etc. Instead it was drivel. Even Liam couldn't save this one. One star for the wonderful Liam Neeson, one star for the surprisingly good poem.
B0015AARJI|4.0|Controller is solid and from all the reviews of fake or knock-off controllers this one seems to be legit. I have not been able to turn on the console by pressing the PS button but otherwise it works fine. It does keep showing up as 7 or 8 on the controller number and that may be why it doesn't turn on. I play Rock Band 3 with all the instruments and that seems to make the controllers register a higher number sometimes. Otherwise the controller has worked fine. I gave it 4 stars simply because I don't know exactly why it doesn't turn on the console when I press the PS button.

1400069289|5.0|Every now and then I read a book so good that the very second I finish it all I want to do is flip back to page one and start all over again.<br /><br />The Power of Habit:Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business by Charles Duhigg is one of those books.<br /><br />I requested a review copy over the holidays when I was working too much, drinking too much, eating too much, not exercising enough, not tickling my kids enough, not snuggling my husband enough, not writing enough... Well, you get the point. New year's resolutions were going to hurt. And I was hoping The Power of Habit would save me from myself.<br /><br />I got so buried that it's taken me until just now to read this amazing book. Luckily it was so good that I read the whole thing in just 3 days!<br /><br />It's just after 5pm and I bet you're exhausted from all the decisions you've made today. Everything from what to wear, what to eat, how fast to drive, what to do first when you got to work, what to do next, how to do it, what to drink with dinner...<br /><br />Wait, what? You didn't make all those decisions?<br /><br />You're right. You didn't.<br /><br />Your habits did.<br /><br />The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business dives deep into the habits that we all form to get us through our days. Can you imagine if you actually HAD to make all of those choices, all of those decisions, every single day.<br /><br />Every moment we are faced with a seemingly endless array of options. The cereal aisle alone has the power to completely shut down my brain. If it wasn't for my ingrained habits (Gloss over everything with the word fruity or chocolate in the title. Skip anything with marshmallows, cute characters, or other aspects designed to appeal to my kids. Look for the familiar, pre-approved cereal boxes...) I could spend hours - days even - just walking up and down that aisle, at a complete loss, reading ingredient lists, nutrition information and weighing overblown health claims.<br /><br />Our brains develop habits to save us from ourselves.<br /><br />Without our habits we'd be paralyzed by all the decisions we have to make.<br /><br />That's the good news.<br /><br />The bad news is that most of us formed our habits before we knew what we wanted to be when we grew up. We formed them before we even knew what habits were. We formed them without ever thinking about how they could affect us later in life. We formed them without thinking, planning, preparing.<br /><br />And now, we're all paying the consequences.<br /><br />Admit it - you have bad habits. I know I do. I forget to eat, and then... I get really, um, not nice. My family says \\"raging bitch\\" is the PC term for what I become when I'm not fed.<br /><br />I tend to overbook myself. I have a habit of saying yes whenever someone asks me to do anything for them.<br /><br />Some people eat too much, some people drink too much, or smoke, or over exercise, or under exercise, or waste time on facebook, or...<br /><br />We all have things we do habitually that we'd like to change, right?<br /><br />Charles takes us deep into our own psyches, exploring individual success stories, companies and programs to see why they work. Why does AA work so well for so many addicts? What does it have that other programs are lacking? What about individuals who have completely turned their lives around, going from overweight couch potatoes with insane debt and a smoking problem to fit, healthy, and wealthy? How did they do it? Is it really just a matter of will power?<br /><br />Is that it, do I just need the will power to Just Say No to my friends, colleagues, and family when they ask me for favors?<br /><br />Not according to Charles Duhigg. His theory is at once simpler and more difficult. Ultimately though, it's also more hopeful. I read his book, and I believed. I believed that with the tools he gave me, with the examples he presented, I COULD change. If I wanted to. Will power be damned.<br /><br />First, Charles laid out how my habits got formed. How all our habits got formed.<br /><br />It's a cycle - that has to be repeated over and over until it becomes ingrained -- until it becomes habit.<br /><br />The cycle can be broken down to - trigger, action/routine, reward.<br /><br />For me the trigger is someone asking me if I can do something for them. My routine is to say yes. The reward - their happiness and thanks.<br /><br />The problem? I say yes too much. I get overbooked. I get stressed and snappy. I can't do a good job on anything because I have too much on my plate. Sometimes I become completely paralyzed by my to-do list and I can't do anything at all.<br /><br />I freeze. I panic. I lash out. It's no bueno.<br /><br />The solution - rewire the habit.<br /><br />I'm not going to tell you how. That's not my job. It's Charles' and he does it so well that I don't want to risk giving it away and making you miss your chance to read this mind-bending, soul expanding, brain exploding book. Yeah, it's all that and an unbroken New Year's Resolution to boot.<br /><br />So, if you want to know the trick, the key, the way and the path to changing your bad habits, or simply to forming new good habits - pick up a copy of Charles Duhigg's book - The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business. I'm buying copies (plural) for my friends and family. If I still had a boss I would get a copy for him/her too. There's a whole section on corporate/business habits that every business owner should read.<br /><br />I hate this cliche, but this book really is a game changer.rles laid out how my habits got formed.

B005DOL0R0|3.0|I was surprised at how cheap this item looked. Although OK for its purpose; I would not buy another; The picture was (I feel) distorted. I can live with my mistake
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this app is very detailed about your battery life and it is very useful. it also tells you how long you hqve to do video or talk
B008JGSM6G|5.0|a little weird at first that you have to fill all the spaces and not just connect dots but that keeps it challenging.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|This device works so well,<br />It downloaded the pictures from the camera very smoothly! They went right into my photo folder on my iPad.
B008D36INE|1.0|Ear-splitting, insipid violin; smoking (LOTS of smoking); a few good performances by supporting actors, a comatose pace, and stilted, stupefying dialog. I guess this was made to remind us all how stilted and stupefying movies were in the 1950s.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|I have not played DH2 but I do enjoy this game ill definetly pick it up. This game reminds me of a dumbed down version of Champions of Norath for PS2. This game is a fast paced arena fighting game.
B004HW7JH4|5.0|If you are a fan of Mad Men it's another treat another great season watching Don progress through the decade.  Without giving spoilers I will say it does have a different feel to it but in a good way you feel the winds of change are upon everybody especially Don he's feeling his age.  Season 5 has to me some of the best episodes of the entire series the entire season was great but the following are 10/10.  Definitely recommend but if you are a Mad Men fan I probably didn't need to tell you that at this point.<br /><br />Mystery Date<br />Signal 30<br />Far Away Places<br />The Other Woman<br />Commissions and Fees
0786860707|5.0|A must for animators! It is a very rich source of knowledge about animation techniques and history, but more than that, it is also very beautiful, turning it into a piece of art, and a treasure for Disney (and animation in general) fans!
0143121006|4.0|This is a fairly short (220 pages) and compelling story about a murder in pre-WWII Peking among the foreign service crowd.  I think it fell off a bit at the end but the first 2/3 makes a real page turner.  Not to spoil anything but nobody is sure what happened.  A fairly strong case is made by the author for the solution, but a legal resolution never occurred.  I checked my copy out of the library.  I wouldn't pay for a hardback copy as you will never go back to it.  However, I enjoyed it and I recommend it.
B007PTJOV0|2.0|Game simply dosent start! :( Could be nice...I use Att Avail and game hungs up during startup. Can someone help me?
B008JGSM6G|4.0|It's a fun game overall. After a while though, it all starts to blend together. Even with the larger grids and more colors later on, it never really gets more difficult. A decent timekiller.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|My kids loved this game. It is similar classic game as i-spy. Very entertaining and different. Thank you and great job!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|This is a really fun game! I wish you could get gems more easily but its free, they have to make a profit somehow.  get this game!!!!!! it may take time but when u reach a high level it is so fun.  ADD MEEEE! lexiethechef
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is one of the best apps I have ever downloaded and played because there are tons of different fun games you can play
B005LAIHY0|5.0|my son and i are monster movie fanatics.during the course of this picture i saw a few people walk out less than halfway through the feature stating that they were very unpleased with how it was turning out. mr.scott was very clear that this was not a direct prequel but one of perhaps a couple to the alien franchise.this was more of a familiarity with the jockey or engineer beings that wandered the cosmos seeding planets with DNA based organics directly from thier own sequence. if any undesireable results occured than the planet was sterilized and perhaps done again in favor of a new more desireable organism. that was really left up in the air for interpratation or another sequel to prometheus. mr.scott originaly stated that the movie was going to be done in two separate features so lets see what is in store next. i did notice that the more interested crowd was older with a few exceptions. there are some younger die hard alien fans that stuck it out to be quite pleased with the end result.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Love the books and couldn't find a better deal.  Only problem is when I read on my iPad thru the kindle app it doesn't have page numbers.  Otherwise no complaints...content is worth every penny.  Winter Is coming!
034580404X|2.0|I finally bought the book (the trilogy) because of ALL the hype about it.  I was really excited to open it and start reading... and then it dragged on until the first sex scene.  The only good parts are the sex scenes and even those aren't what I was expecting.  This is a very poorly written soft porn book for bored housewives.  I was NOT impressed.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|Like others, I had a bit of trouble getting through the dryness of the first chapter. Not knowing what lied ahead, I forced myself to dig in and finish. Once I got to chapter 2, I was hooked. Also, like others, many times I paused to marvel at the eloquence and nuanced genius within Mitchell's writing. I won't give the story away, but Mitchell's ability to 'throw his voice' and create such different characters, settings and tones is an uncanny talent most authors would kill for.<br /><br />Overall, this book restored my faith in what a novel could be. If you love stories, this is the book for you.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|DVD the best ever, good script, good story, good cinematography. Enjoyed it several times. Not my idea of a Woody Allen movie.
B007MNV5WU|3.0|This is the best Angry Birds version out so far. really love this app very much. wish they priced it lower.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love it &bull; It is so fun.  I cant wait to play it again. Love it love it love it love it
B008CP93S0|2.0|mildly amuzing-that is all there is to say-acting-probably one of Jennifer's worst-she must have needed a paycheck-was fun to see Alan Alda
B004P8JPS6|4.0|It amazes me that a writer can create a continuous tale, from one book to the next, without any highs or lows. The books all flow like a road map, from one episode to the next. I have enjoyed each and every one.
B0088TG252|5.0|This is a clean movie. Sure, You have your language, but its awesome. This is not suitable for the little ones. I enjoyed this movie. I didn't buy it from Amazon, but I rented it from the Redbox. This was a great flick. I enjoyed it. I watched it twice. It was great. Tobin Frost-REMEMBER THE NAME. Denzel did a great job along with the Housekeeper. Always make sure he guest is safe. I loved this movie. I would like to buy this.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I have always been a fan of nonograms.  I tried several similar apps and this was the best and has by far the largest selection of skill levels and puzzles.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I have used this app quite extensively in my farmers market stand and also for home sales.  It is easy to use and much easier to keep track of long stacks of numbers than the apps I have used on other small gadgets.  It is even easier than the calculator on my laptop.  While there are adds I don't find them at all intrusive or obnoxiuos.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|Product works as described. There's definitely a difference in having the product with over-the-ear headphones. I have some really cheap Koss headphones, so if you're afraid this product won't work for your headphones, no need to worry. Product isn't complete necessary unless you're looking for a small, simple upgrade to listening experience.<br /><br />Warning: This product is really small. Like cut a credit card in half, and that's almost the size of the square body.
B007TXN4TK|5.0|great app for complete beginner. lots of fun. my only request is to shoe the notes too. ive been wanting to learn and this app is a great help. I can practice on the plane now
B0001US8EO|4.0|After having read quite a few books on Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday, this film is the best one I've seen about these two men.  Like many men of their time, the Earp's and Holliday were wanderers.  Kevin Costner's portrayal of the strong self-posessed Earp is quite believable and Dennis Quaid's portrayal of 'Doc' Holliday with his soft Georgian drawl and spare TB-laden frame is excellent.
B0058YPG2K|5.0|The fourth season is great. Walt gets in even deeper and is a badass. If you haven't seen it, then you should watch from the beginning.
B008KRJWEK|4.0|if you like temple run you may like this. you can pic you're car and up grades. it tells you the number of miles you went. its fun to me because its like tills run.
B008K8H9C6|3.0|started to be a neat game i paid for, but after i got so far, my phone freezes.  keep having to reboot. please fix.
B006X08FDA|5.0|I love traditional music and this album fills the bill. The music makes feel like a kid.  I also got a cd from the Hertiage Blues orchestra.  Just beautiful music. Thank you.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|When I first went to read this book it was purely out of curiosity on why Fifty Shades of Grey was such a big deal. I did not think I would make it far or that I would end up reading the entire series in less than 3 days and then read it again a week later. I really thought it was going to be a bunch of pointless intense sex that would bore me to tears. NOT TRUE! For anyone who thinks that this book is only about the fact that Christian is a Dominant and wanted Ana as a Submissive you have been mislead. I do not want to give anything away for anyone who wants to read this but trust me when I say that there is so much more to the story line then just the dominant/submissive story. This is about a man that had a rough start, and is very troubled. The whole dominant thing is a big part of the book but it is also Christians past and only part of his present. This series takes you through a very intimate relationship that develops between Christian and Ana, and in no way is it a traditional courting but it is a beautiful story. Life is not perfect, people are not perfect, but when you really love someone you make it perfect for you. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a love story that is not perfect, but overcomes the many obstacles that can come up in life.
B00884GR0W|5.0|one of the best apps out there. People are saying that it is bad because &quot;its a rip of mine craft&quot;. Well its not . Its a great game so every one who says its a rip of mine craft can shut up.
B005CKPQNE|1.0|UPDATE: I have been told that the Breaking Bad DVD's contained a defective batch of DVD's that used only the Spanish audio WITHOUT sub-titles. This is obviously the version I bought. But, I've been so pissed off about this whole problem that I'm through with this whole subject matter. The plain truth is that Breaking Bad started out with a couple of seasons of great shows...but then has drizzled off to mediocrity by the ending which I no longer care about.    The director and producers are getting a little too cocky about their shows success if they think they can insult our intelligence by expecting us to waste time trying translate all the Spanish bulls*** the characters are saying for  13 minutes in Season 4 episodes.    What creative brainstorm are the producers going to try next?  Black out the screen for entire segments of the show because that will be cool and different and help us all imagine what the show would be like if we were blind for 13 minutes? Methinks the producers and writers are sampling \\"too much product\\" which interferes with rational creative decisions.  That whole Spanish segment ruined the \\"suspended disbelief\\" and magic of the show for me. I pushed \\"EJECT\\" on my DVD player and loaded in a better movie to watch.    Just for writing my opinion here, I suppose I'll be chastised for not drinking the kool-aid of the politically correct fanatics. But I'll be damned if I'll tolerate the force-feeding of Spanish dialogue on a popular show. I feel like a sucker for being a fan if this is what they think of us viewers. Bad call, AMC!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I put this app on my kindle to use during my vacation by the pool and absolutely love it!  I get advertisements after every game but I can deal with that since it was free.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Magic Puzzles, in all its incarnations, is beautiful, and stimulating in its varied modes of play. But the very best aspect of this puzzle is the incredible variety of puzzle packs available to the player. There exists a puzzle for every mood and interest. Dive in, and you will keep coming back for more.
B0088RQ4X4|1.0|I have 3, 7, and 10 year old boys and none of them could watch this movie the entire way through. I was bored too so I can't blame them. This movie looked so awesome in the preview and my kids were excited to see it. It was a humungous let down!!!
0545265355|2.0|The movie may be better that the book. Bought this for my kids, it was as ok read. Does not compare with Harry Potter (5 stars) or Artemis Fowl (4 stars)<br />A lot of it sounds just like run of the mill kid's movies - like Brave, etc.<br />Read all three, then gave away the books. My kids did not read it, and no place in my library for books I only want to read once.
0756405890|4.0|The Name of the Wind is day one of Kvote relating the story of his remarkable life to the Chronicler, a story that has evoked legends from truth and that seems to span several lifetimes. This book was captivating from the first pages, drawing me in and connecting me with the characters in a way that kept me turning pages and left me wanting more when I reached the end. The tales woven are rich with deep detail and the additional fables and songs within add a life and history to the world that so many other creations lack.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this read and will be happy when I get my hands on the next book in the series.
B006P0FIGU|3.0|Whenever I watch a \\"period\\" film that's liberally punctuated with anachronistic elements, I automatically assume the writers are either too lazy or stupid to properly research the period in question (hoping instead that viewers won't notice their mistakes or believe that they are hip and edgy because of them!).<br />I will say this movie was beautiful to look at.  Obviously, a lot of money was spent on sets, locations, and the incredible costumes (the wigs were another matter).  Less money was used on the screenplay and it shows.  As mentioned by others, the story had a tendency to wander from the source material.  When it bothered to adhere to some of the plotline, it came across as Classics Illustrated for those who have no intention of reading Alexandre Dumas' book Les Trois Mousquetaires.  Worse, this new, and supposedly improved, story began as a caper flick, complete with slow motion action sequences (a device I've never understood nor appreciated as it defies the term action).  At least the swordplay was fun.  I won't even go into the balloons or the pirate battle in the sky.  They could be looked upon as either stupendous or just plain stupid.  Really, dirigibles, has someone confused their centuries?<br />As for the actors, with their accents askew, only a handful redeemed themselves, the rest were just an odd assortment of misplaced thespians in search of their character.  The worst of the lot was Christoph Waltz as Cardinal Richelieu.  His performance was flat, every scene in which he appeared he failed to register.  If it wasn't for the red outfit, I wouldn't have known he was there.  Also less than impressive was Mads Mikkelsen as Captain Rochefort.  Where was the menace?  He was supposed to be the chief villain behind the evil Richelieu.  An eye patch does not a villain make.  Another odd choice was Milla Jovoich as Milady de Winter; did no one think to clue her in as to what type of movie she was making?  Yes, standing out is usually a good thing, here, she was just out there.  And then there was Musketeer Junior, Logan Lerman as D'Artagnan with his decidedly American accent.  Hello, where were the French in all of this!?<br />Once it was over, with the obvious threat of a sequel, I was left wondering if I really enjoyed what I just saw or not.  I honestly can't say I hated it, but I also can't say I loved it either.  Which leaves me with the dilemma, to keep or not to keep?  (I bought it used and in pristine condition.  Cheap.)  Maybe I will watch it again.e, she was just out there.  And then there was Musketeer Junior, Logan Lerman as D'Artagnan with his decidedly American accent.

0345803485|1.0|how could this mindless piece of crap become a best seller, then have the movie rights sold?! i am not a writer but could have done a much beter job.  had to read it to see what all the hype was about.  boring, disappointing and infantile, along with being predictable.  fifty shades of crap is what i call it.  very poor piece of writing. is this the future of literature and writing?  lets hope not.
B008MEM24S|5.0|pac man is the greastest game ever made. ive played centipede,  middle command,  space invaders,  disc of tron,  and moon lander. out of all these games I love pac man.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It starts off a little slow at first, but after getting onto the higher levels, it really starts to get challenging. Already hooked!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love these types of games. So far this is my fav! I cant seem to put it down. : )
B007I2BZIE|5.0|My expectations were solid but not particularly high for Clockwork Angels. A lifelong Rush fan, I enjoyed Snakes and Arrows but wondered if Clockwork Angels would merely be a continuation of the kinds of songs on Snakes and Arrows. Much to my amazement, Clockwork Angels turned out to be one of Rush's greatest albums. The \\"feel\\" of the music is so live-like (like live music) and real; the epic theme of the individual's struggle against conformity in Peart's lyrics utterly gorgeous. Get this album and enjoy! Thank you Rush for finally finding your groove again after so many years!
B0007Y08QA|5.0|We rented this movie to watch as a family thinking it would be an action-type suspense movie.  Not even close!  This is a very dark movie that keeps you wondering what exactly is going on, but keeps you riveted & interested throughout the entire movie.  Christian Bale is absolutely amazing as the main character who is obviously fighting some very dark demons that control him to the point of starvation, hallucination & extreme insomnia.  Without a doubt, Bale's acting in this movie is Oscar-worthy & I can't believe I have never heard of this movie before casually renting last night. This movie will leave you speechless, but it is definitely not for the faint-at-heart & is NOT a family viewing movie, particularly for small children.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I am very impressed by this author. I rarely read a book that has me so engrossed. The strength of this story lies not only in the fantastic world building the author possesses, but also the depth of the characters he creates.<br /><br />He is able to create vivid scenes with few words, something most modern fantasy writers lack. The end of this book will leave you satisfied. He doesn't leave any awkward, unanswered questions that most series seem to prefer. This is a complete story in and of itself.<br /><br />I hope you enjoy this adventure as much as I did!
B006X4VVFU|5.0|This episode was worth the wait.  If you've enjoyed seasons 1 and 2, you must see this episode. I had to purchase this episode seperately so if you buy these, see if this is included in the set. This episode answered many questions and also set the stage for the next season. I would certainly recommend it.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|A good summer read for adults as well as kids.  Already ordered the second In the series.  Very interesting concept and am glad I don't live in Panem.
B005HSL626|5.0|This app is so fun I play it like all the time.  Its one of my favorite apps I have on my lineal fir.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Every time I see this movie with my daughter we find somethind new we did't notice before. It is truly a well made movie and the amimation is wonderful.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|A very fast written thriller..  If you were the parents, what would you do?  How would you feel??  The story leaves a lot up to your own interpretation, as does life.  But at the end, what would you do if you thought your child was a monster?
B008JIFJ4W|5.0|Passion pit have always had an intimate feel to their lyrics, as chunk of change was written for angelakos' girlfriend. But gossamer takes it to new territory. With a warm, personal and sometimes heartbreaking feel to it, with out losing their upbeat danceable nature, the passion pits second full length album is a great compliment to their previous releases. Recommended tracks are \\"carried away\\", \\"constant conversations\\", \\"cry lIke a ghost\\", and \\"where we belong\\". thanks.
B00821OX98|5.0|I was looking for something new to watch on Netflix and I came across Falling Skies.  It wasn't available on Netflix, so I checked with Amazon.com and found it was available.  I decided to order the first season from Amazon and I am now caught up with everything such that I look forward to each new show.  The show provides a fairly realistic depiction of the aches and pains of war without being overly graphic with its violence, but then it is a show about a desperate fight for human survival.  The character development and relationships are outstanding for a TV show!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|Love this app . If I were you I would get this app. One thing you should know about this app is that it doesn't freeze on you but every once an a while. like never. This app rocks.
B005544V6A|5.0|Saw one episode of season 2 of Suits and was hooked.  But couldn't find Season 1 online to watch.  I found it on Amazon and purchases it immediately.  I have no problems with it streaming through my Roku player.  I will definitely purchase other TV series through Amazon.  It is already my favorite choice when renting movies.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I had a widget on my computer home page showing best sellers and these three books by e.l.james were at the top of the list for so long; I just decided to read them and so I bought the entire trilogy for a better financial deal.  OH! I will never buy another book without reading a sample first.  I was so shocked that America would have such a following for books that describe a sado/masochist sexual theme.  I have never considered myself a prude but I have no interest in \\"opening my mind\\" to depravity. I wish I could have asked for a refund but I realize I bought it so my only option was to delete it from my kindle.  Save yourself. Always do the sample first.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|If You saw the First Sherlock Holmes Movie, then this one is much better. It leaves You guessing until the end, whether Sherlock is dead or not. A must video for every Sherlock Holmes Fan.
B008M34INW|4.0|This is a darn good movie.  Get The Gringo is an action flick, with some sort of love interest thing going on there too, but in a criminal sort of way.  Mel Gibson has proven well suited to leading man roles where he expresses bursts of pure animalistic rage, and this movie is no exception.  The film takes place south of the US border, in a Mexican prison that Mel's character in the movie asks, \\"Is this a prison or the world's crummiest mall?\\".  Splashed with plenty of violence, intermingled throughout are many light hearted moments, comedic angles to an otherwise gritty and hard edged storyline.  You've got to hand it to Mel Gibson, he's a superstar for a reason.  There is a little bit of Espanol spoken throughout, with subtitles, and in my opinion this movie would also have good appeal in Mexicano households.  I liked it a lot.  Not as good as Braveheart, but quite a bit better than Lethal Weapon.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love how this app has lots of challenges and that's its free.  If I were you I get this app .
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Fun but crashes from time to time.  I allso like the mini-game that's included.  As with other free games, some things are unreachable unless you are willing to purchase credits. just the way it is.

B00881VLCE|1.0|So far it won't let me in. I'll update it if I can get it to open. Was hoping to enjoy a puzzle without the cats helping.
B00007GZQZ|5.0|This movie was Tom Hanks trying to do charlie chaplin slapstick. The pranks and mini disasters got to be too much halfway through the movie.
B007MNV5WU|3.0|the game is hours of fun but I hate how the updates for kindle fire is so damn slow and have to wait so long all the time for updates on all angry birds games for the kindle fire
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game but some times it it is agervating. now I think it is expensive for the game.
B00000F169|3.0|The special effects (and hair styles) in Dark Star are dated compared to current movies.  Heck, they're dated compared to the original Star Trek.  Fortunately, this low budget comedy doesn't depend on special effects.  It depends instead on jokes.  Some of the humor seems targeted at grade school kids, although the rubber chicken gag never gets old.  A lengthy chase scene (a crew member armed with a broom chases an alien that looks like a beach ball with feet) gets old long before it ends.<br /><br />Dark Star is the kind of movie that works best if you're too stoned to watch a movie that has a plot.  It has its moments.  The arguments between Bomb Number 20 (which really wants to launch) and the ship's computer (which keeps telling it to go back into its bay) are funny and the movie ends well (for the viewer, not so much for the crew).  Dark Star had me chuckling every now and then, but if you're looking for laugh-out-loud science fiction comedy, go with [[ASIN:B001S86J0I Galaxy Quest]].
B004H83IM8|4.0|If you've waited to buy the Austin Powers movies on DVD, then you're in luck. This two-disc set has all three movies for a seriously low price. (If you can't find Goldmember, try flipping one of the DVDs over.) The original is just as funny as ever. The second and third are still amusing but somewhat dated. Still, this is a worthy addition to your DVD collection.
B005ZUR724|4.0|good fun game.  like a miniworld of warcraft.  if you like quest games then this is the the one for you
B0067Q42BY|5.0|It's awesome. I love that there is a quest version or the regular game. The tiles are interesting. The artifacts are a great touch.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Provides necessary break between appointments.  Easy to play and if you're patient it doesn't cost $$$.  Recommend for moms because of the short movies if you get the theater. Keeps my 2 year old occupied when I need to make a call. for work.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is a really fun game.....some times it gets hard but overall its a really amusing game! I love one direction!!!

0307744434|3.0|The descriptions of the scenes in this book were like paintings. I could see, hear, smell and taste everything. I loved the circus and the quirky characters. The plot began to flag in the middle, however, and I had to force myself to finish. All in all, however, I am glad I read it. Our book club read this book and we had a lot of fun discussing it.
1400069289|5.0|Pro:<br />+ Completely describes habits:  cues, routines, rewards, motivation, neurology, and even a framework to change (replace) them.<br />+ Theories explain tendencies of people to regress back to old (bad) habits<br />+ Uses many different examples. e.g. Rosa Parks, an Ohio factory, gambling, the author's own cookie habit, and more<br />+ Case studies added interest while making reading easier and more memorable<br />+ Over 50 pages of supplemental notes supporting the science of the work written make this book very credible<br />+ Using the \\"notes\\" (sources) section of the book I was able to obtain some of the articles referenced, which helped with my studies<br /><br />Con:<br />- A picky thing really... I wish diagrams were numbered so that I can more easily reference them<br /><br />Neutral:<br />> Some inconsequential citation snafus (e.g. a citation on p. 112 was attributed to a Cornell professor in 1984, but it appears to be made by the Center for Applied Research in 1998 or another on p. 120 from \\"a 2009 study\\" which appears to have actually been 2008)<br /><br />Bottomline:  Highly recommended.  This provides more why habits are so powerful - it helps unlocks the mechanisms behind \\"habits\\" so they can be created, protected, or replaced.  Complementary to other works I've read and worth the time to add to your collection.
B00319ECGK|2.0|I purchased this blu-ray to upgrade from my DVD. The Picture transfer is great,BUT the audio was a poor excuse for a Blu-ray. This is the worst blu-ray i have come across since the first release of Terminator 2 on blu-ray. If you want T2 on blu-ray the skynet edition is an excellent upgrade!! Warner Bros. needs to do the same and upgrade the audio to a 6.1 DTS for one of the best action movies of all time to truely experience the dynamic sound that The Matrix should be watched with. Until then dont waste your money on this Blu-ray if you own the DVD.
B008MEM24S|5.0|My grandson was beyond excited to get this game. He kept asking me to download it.  I was very happy when I was finally able to do so.  He LOVES it!!
030758836X|5.0|I haven't finished reading this yet, but I can hardly put it down. I love the writing and the characters and am totally caught up in the mystery. So far, it is great.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this app is the most addictinng app ive ever played in my life.  I cant ever put it down. I saw the movie and right away when I got home I got on the app store and I looked for a game versing.
0802473156|5.0|This is a must read book for married couples (or those planning to be married).<br />It contains practical information about learning the type of love that best fills your spouse's needs.  It is a good read for newly married couples or couples who have been married 20, 30, or 40 years!  Sometimes we think we know our spouse's love language but we are only loving from our strengths, not their needs.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|As with ALL Baldacci novels, it is hard to put down and great action from start to finish. Good character development with a semi surprise ending.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Awesome book, but do not purchase this version if you have an iPad. It works on my iPhone and shows up in the cloud, but will not download to my iPad. I spent an hour online and on the phone with amazon. They couldn't find a solution. They said it is not yet compatible with iPad. Bummer. Still, a great book....just have to read it from my small iPhone screen. :)  The other two books work fine for iPad.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a fun game. It works well on the Kindle Fire. In game, you can customize background and card backs. It is a good game for solitaire.
B005IQZB14|4.0|A true account of a young woman deciding against wallowing in grief and possible heroin addiction. This heroine deliberately strays into the wilds: hiking boots,back pack et al. Alone! A courageous do it yourself rehab. Reading her book is like having a conversation with a dear friend whom you admire, only YOU do the listening this time!

B003Y5H4Y8|5.0|It took me a while to actually sit down and watch this movie, because I honestly thought it was going to be boring.<br /><br />As you can tell from the 5-star rating, it is anything but dull!<br /><br />Reviews here are mixed, but I found the film riveting from beginning to end, with truly amazing performances from the exceptional cast.<br /><br />Yes, Helen Mirren is terrific, but IMHO, Chastain and Worthington are the real stars.<br /><br />I've seen the former in quite a few movies already, and her versatility is positively astounding. Her turn as Rachel Singer is Oscar-worthy - a beautiful balance of courage and vulnerability.<br /><br />Her on-screen chemistry with Worthington is breath-taking! Every scene they share is electrifying, and the part where they share a passionate, forbidden kiss is absolutely heartbreaking.<br /><br />But Worthington blew my mind as David. I didn't enjoy his roles in Avatar and the Titans films, though he first impressed me in Terminator Salvation.<br /><br />He undergoes a remarkable transformation here. I have never seen him look more tortured or lovelorn. Scenes with Chastain are sizzling hot, while those with Christensen sent chills down my spine.<br />And keep a lookout for the train station action sequence - it's the only high-octane bit in the entire film, but superbly executed.<br /><br />I now have new-found respect for Worthington's abilities as an actor. I hope he'll be offered roles that are worthy of his talent. Get out of the Titans franchise, for pete's sake!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I have nothing more to say, as all the other 1 or 2 star reviews have said it all for me.<br /><br />The writing is horrible.<br />If I bit my lip that many times, I wouldn't have one left.<br />This is teenage erotica written for 16 year-olds who have yet to realize that they ARE complete without a \\"man\\" to beat the crap out of them.<br /><br />Not much more to say. I hated this book.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Living in SD I love to know when &amp; where the storms are.  With this app its always there &amp; ready.  I even keep track of my family's weather in Texas- Nebr &amp; NC.  Love it!!!

B00004Z4SD|1.0|I saw this Movie on Television when it first aired and I loved it. I vowed then to someday own a copy of it. Well... now I do...and it is a crime what someone did to it! scenes have been cut from it and the long distance scenes  have had the sound butchered from them so that you cannot hear what is said. I expected to get a copy of the original...UNCUT movie... but that is not what I received... the movie I received...I could have gotten off the $5 rack at Walmart! MOST DISAPPOINTING!
B008KRJWEK|3.0|i don't know what to say because i haven't download this game yet. haha so funny. add me on facebook adibfikry mohdzaini.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Not as erotic as the first book, but probably the best written of the trilogy - it`s not literature, it`s entertainment. and as a women who is all about female equality, the submissive acts are about sexuality, not about misogyny.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This app is the best place to play games when your bored. I highly recommend this app for people who love play games.
B007C4ZJ0S|4.0|From where I stand \\"Haywire\\" is a little too artsy to completely satisfy the action crowd and too low-brow to satisfy the high-brows.  In my opinion Steven Soderburgh's film is good but a little too antiseptic for it's own good.  Regardless Lem Dobb's script is intriguing and has enough twists and turns to keep you on the edge of your seat.  The film also has decent characterization and an able supporting cast to see it through.  The film heralds a real star in Gina Carano.  Carano is as lithe as a cat and just as sexy.  With Carano's Mallory Kane, Zoe Saldana as Colombiana, and Anne Hathaway as Salina Kyle there's a real boom in female action stars.  Not classic but good popcorn entertainment.  I'm still puzzled by the film's \\"R\\" rating.  There is a certain degree of violence but it's mostly muted and not gratuitous.  There was certainly a similar level of violence in \\"Snow White and the Huntsman\\" or \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" which received \\"PG-13\\" ratings from the MPAA.
B006MW3VGA|2.0|Only ten minutes long, this is hardly worth it as an appetite whetter.  I purchased the whole series elsewhere and the last disk had \\"extras\\" that were far more interesting.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|great game. really fun.good for older ages. not really for little ones. I loveed it! so get it and enjoy!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I like it got stuck playing it for a while. Get it you'll enjoy it. My son seen it on my kinde and then downloaded it on his we recommend.  You give.it a try
1466401885|3.0|I bought this as it was recommended by Amazon, but I wasn't really excited after I read it. It was interesting enough to finish, but I wasn't bowled over.  The characters act immature to me. Granted, they are college students, but to much breaking up and getting back together. It was kind of silly to me.
B002S0OBMS|4.0|Exceptionally good CD by Andrew Lloyd Webber...Sound is very good and the music as well....Not a lot of music that you will walk around humming as in \\"Phantom Of The Opera\\", but good nontheless....I don't think it had much of a run on Broadway but it did  pretty well in London....JJJ
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I was looking at the app store when I came across this game! I am having so much fun with it. I am sick and it has kept me entertained! Great game.  &lt;(^_^)&gt;
B007SYWFRM|5.0|i like it it was fun and easy. it was also kinda.  funney but all inall. it was a realy fun story game it was well topped off
0345803485|1.0|I bought this book because of the hype, It was the most boring book I've ever read, and I read a lot. I couldn't finish it, I tried but I'd rather clean my bathroom.<br />Why does it still get such positive attention? It's written to bore you to sleep, If you need to fall asleep this is the perfect read.
B006GHA9QQ|5.0|I think that Andrew Lloyd Webber adapted \\"Love Never Dies\\" from a book \\"The Phantom of New York\\" by Fredrick Forseyth...We picked up the book ten years or so in an off the wall bookstore in San Diego and enjoyed it very much...It is a  continuation of Webber's \\"Phantom of The Opera\\" in New York City...I'm not sure the mucical ever hit Broadway, but know that it did well in London's West End...Never heard much more about it but it appeared on PBS in May 2012 and we watched and enjoyed it as well....Did not know that a CD and DVD was availible until the PBS showing....It is a good experience for Phantom fans who wonder what became of him after the Opera House in Paris....We were pleased to find it availible at Amazon....JJJ

1433524619|5.0|I wish I had bought this Bible sooner! I purchased the hardcover style as it is the cheapest, but it still looks nice. The pages are very thin, probably the thinnest of any Bible I've had, but I can still mark/highlight (just not with gel ink) and it's okay.<br /><br />I started at the very beginning reading all the notes on the study Bible and ESV translation. I didn't read these portions all at once, I took my time reading them, and have continued to take my time reading the book. I read about one chapter per day, due to the notes on each verse. And the notes are very good. I read the chapter first and then read the notes, and then go back and underline or make my own notes. The notes reinforce what the verses are about and also give historical context such as, the flood accounts from other historical texts, which I love! Context helps me to understand the Bible so much, as we live in a different time and culture, and context also addresses how this verse fits in the Bible as a whole.<br /><br />I enjoy reading this Bible and it has enriched my personal study of the Bible, the characters, the nature of God, and human nature. I would recommend this Bible along with [[ASIN:0736901248 The Daily Bible: In Chronological Order 365 Daily Readings]] in chronological order (NIV). Both have helped me to understand the Bible so much more. I've read The Daily Bible twice (2 years approximately). I imagine this one might take me 2-3 years. If you don't have it, buy it!
B002G1YPH0|4.0|This CPU cooler seems to do a good job of keeping the CPU cool, and the addition of a second fan (you have to buy it) makes it even better (just be sure to have them blowing the same way). However it is big. Check your case size and Mobo before buying, on my Mobo (GIGABYTE GA-990FXA-UD3) it almost completely blocks off one of my RAM slots with the second fan. Finally be sure to look on youtube for the how to video the instructions suck on how to install this cooler. (hint it is best done before you put the mobo in the case) For these issues I'd kick off half a star but if you have a roomy case and or don't mind obstructing a RAM slot this is still a good cooler.

B0058Z4NR8|5.0|If you're into history and wants to inquire on how great nations rise and why some nations fail, then this book should be of interest to you. It presents to the readers the recipe which can either break or make a country. My country is in development stage and I believe that younger generations should learn from the past mistakes and create a better for all of us.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I enjoy playing this game every day. It is the best game ever!Yes it is true what I just said.
B005UBNKZG|5.0|Would I have loved to see a huge increase in performance with this cpu over its Intel competition, yes. Did we, not really. However given the current state of software utilization of multiple cores in the CPU and the forward thinking design I am willing to let that slide. This is a good solid black edition cpu. The only real difference between this one and the 8150 is the core clock speed. Just use a OC program and save the money. I have faith that this cpu will be more future proof than a faster Intel model. Windows 7 struggles to use more than 4 cores at a time with this CPU and windows 8, while I am weary of the metro UI just might be able to make this cpu outshine it's competition.
055380684X|4.0|One of my coworkers went to see Daniel Coyle speak somewhere in the jungle that is suburban Atlanta.<br /><br />I won out. She bought me his book: The Talent Code: Greatness Isn't Born. It's Grown. Here's How. (affiliate link).<br /><br />Visualizing Talent Growth<br /><br />The thesis of the book is that talent improves through the growth of myelin. Myelin is this stuff that wraps around nerve fibers almost like the plastic or rubber that wraps around electrical wire.<br /><br />The difference between electrical wire and nerve fibers is that the thicker the myelin gets, the more efficient the nerve fibers fire. As they fire efficiently, they work better and talent improves.<br /><br />I practice now, I picture these little myelin contractors working in my brain, wrapping nerve fibers and making me better.<br /><br />Deep Practice, Ignition, and Coaching<br /><br />What I love about the book--whether I buy in wholeheartedly that talent is by no means born but completely made, is that it provides a visual hook to getting better at anything.<br /><br />Becoming more talented requires what Coyle calls 'deep practice.' Deep practice involves slow, repeated, analyzed, corrected, chunked efforts at the same thing.<br /><br />Swing the golf club. It hooks. Adjust. Swing again. Break down. Is it the backswing? Is it the follow through? Is it the grip? Adjust again, swing again. And so on.<br /><br />With each repetition, myelin grows and wraps around the nerve fibers, causing them to fire more effectively.<br /><br />Basically, you find and fix and dial in. As you do, the white matter (myelin) thickens and talent grows.<br /><br />The other two elements are ignition and coaching.<br /><br />Ignition is, in the parlance of a lot of success literature, finding your 'why'. The talent hotbeds Coyle looks into include Curacao and South Korea. Both of these locations were ignited when Andruw Jones and Si Ri Pak experienced success. As a result, both locations started excelling in baseball and women's golf, respectively.<br /><br />Coyle also found that coaching was key. The ability for a teacher or coach to break down the elements of a skill into chunks and know how each student learned best amplified and accelerated the growth of myelin.<br /><br />When You Practice Your Brain Fires Better<br /><br />The book seems to indicate that absolutely anybody could have been Pavarotti if they only were ignited, coached, and deeply practiced. Perhaps that true.<br /><br />What I love is the idea that I can work to make the myelin grow and get better at anything. I might never be world class but I'll be a heck of a lot closer to it.<br /><br />I never have to assume I just don't have what it takes by some genetic natural selection. When I go to the driving range, I can work my swing. I can improve. I can break it down.<br /><br />Honestly, when I make sales calls. If I make the call, observe, change up, call again, etc. Am I not just building myelin?<br /><br />Myelin and Habit<br /><br />I'm a believer in God--that God created humans and gave us some kind of a purpose. Sometimes that makes us think that we're fatalistically destined to be good or bad at stuff.<br /><br />But I also believe that God set certain biological stuff into action. If he chose myelin, then he made it possible that I don't have to settle for current skill levels. I can always get better. So can everybody else.<br /><br />Consistently practicing and developing habits creates myelin that just might make you a better hack than you ever thought you could be! And that is probably enough to give you bragging rights.<br /><br />I recommend the book. Read it and be encouraged to get better at whatever is you hope to get better at.baseball and women's golf, respectively.<br /><br />Coyle also found that coaching was key.

B008KRJWEK|3.0|its a fun game but I only give it a 3 star because ever time you revie your car so you can keep playing it goes up in price and coins are hard to get depending on how far you can drive. and when the stuipd guys jump on your car the only way to get them off is to lightly scrap the edge of another car but that causes you to crash sometimes. a lot like temple run but with cars and mutans
B005LAIIRQ|1.0|It all depends on why you go to the movies. Camera, sound, special effects and casting seems to be working fine. (Not excellent though) However, story line does not have a straight line. It's a circle. (Spoiler: Do not read if you want to go and see the movie) Suicidal man sits on a plane. The plane crashes into the mountains. A few survive and try to find their way out. Some meaningless conversations and then they all die.<br /><br />Really! there is absolutely nothing to enjoy about this movie, except if you are a critic, looking for something slightly different.<br /><br />Go have a nice dinner instead!
B000AOEMXM|1.0|Star Trek needs to learn to move forward not backwards. I couldn't stand Enterprise. I think this series was a waste of time.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|There have been only a few games I really enjoyed, like quell and refraction (and lightbulbs on the blackberry)... This one is fun but so easy I beat the whole thing in around two hours. Worth the download, though.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this game. Easy to use and offers options on card styles, game styles and more. This is a must have app.
B004Q7CIFI|4.0|A compelling cautionary tale about time travel and the potentially devestating ramifications of \\"playing God.\\" Reading 11/22/63, I was pleasantly reminded of Garth Brooks' hit song, \\"The Dance,\\" in more ways than one. The story was original, the characters, were compelling, and the narrative was classic King. More suspense and drama than horror, but richly steeped in sci-fi themes and full of surprises. At several points I thought I knew how it was going to end, but King surprised me again.<br /><br />\\"Obdurate\\" must've been the Reader's Digest Word Power word of the day when King was writing this book, and thanks to his obsessive use thereof, it's now part of my vocabulary, as well.<br /><br />My only criticism is that the interrogation scene after the shooting seemed oddly familiar, like I'd seen it before on \\"Twilight Zone\\" or \\"The Outer Limits.\\" Also, Jake/George's heroism immediately surrounding the shooting seemed over-the-top and a bit unrealistic to me. I also found some of the alternate history after Jake's timestream manipulation to be somewhat implausable -- like (SPOILER ALERT!) Hillary Clinton's \\"stepping in\\" to become President after Bill's heart attack. The protagonist's political leanings are clear --and that's to be expected, considering those of the author-- but that particular scenario could've used a little more thought, or at least elaboration.<br /><br />Overall, this was an excellent read, definitely worth your time and money. I couldn't put it down. Jake's story is, at the heart, a beautiful love story, a lovely dance with destiny and the personal sacrifices that must at times be made for the \\"better good\\" of humanity.
B0012GMWCU|5.0|This is a GREAT CD it's the first Willie Dixon CD I have but I could see myself buying more after listining to this one. 2 thumbs up !!!!!!!!!!!
030758836X|3.0|I read the superlative reviews on this book and was eager to dive into it. The book, with its terrific writing, interesting characters, and plot twists, kept me enthralled throughout. When I'm really into a book, I'm reading at warp speed, anxiously wanting to know what happens next. And that's the way I read this book. Having said that, I'm unsure about recommending this book. As I said, this was a terrific read, and yet I think this book could have been so much better. First, there was a major plot hole concerning the whereabouts of the Desi character the day Amy goes missing. It's a detail that the police could have used in ultimately solving the crime. And the pregnancy plot point was totally unbelievable. But my biggest complaint, as many have noted, is the ambivalent ending.  When I turned the last page to see the acknowledgements, I said out loud, \\" WTF!... am I missing some pages?  Maybe it's because I'm old school, but when it comes to a story, I want to have a definitive ending and this book doesn't deliver.  If someone were to ask me what I thought of the book I would have to say, \\"If you loved the ending to the Sopranos, you love this book\\".  Oh well, maybe the conclusion to the story will be in \\"Gone Girl, Part II\\"
B007IXWKUK|1.0|Written at a 5th grade level (content excluded).  Redundant use of words.  Provided hours of eye rolling.  While there is plenty of good erotica available, this definetly does not qualify.  Do not believe the hype.
B005HJWWW8|3.0|Using higher impedance (750 Ohms) headphones I get a lower frequencies distortion in it's worst. Nice design, sleek, light and compact. Battery lasts for at least 2 hours of continuous use. Recommend this one as per specifications for usage with headphones with up to 150 Ohms of impedance. Using an iPhone I get a solid sound when the amplifier works at around 75-85% capacity. + on the fact that there are 2 extension cables. Like the led light on the side, but I guess it drains battery. So I took 2 stars off since this is an amplifier and it should amplify with min distortion even at peak levels, but it doesn't. So don't use it with max input on an Iphone.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I cannot stop playing! Makes me crazy trying all the options.  Will recommend to all my friends.  Great mind  tease. Challenging!
B00884GR0W|3.0|this is a really fun game, but I find one problem with it. I am playing on the Kindle Fire whick usually works great for games but in this one the screen will completley freeze over amd I will have to restart my device. I didnt know this when I bought it so right now have wasted money unless there is some trick. Relating to having to restart, whenever I go to open the game again, my saved slot is empty so I am finding playing this pointless. If I could find some way to navigate around these obstacles, it would be an amazing game, if your tablet/phone works better than mine, I would say go for it!
B008MEM24S|5.0|love it. no issues on my kindle fire. lots of fun. if u like where's my water, you'll love this game too.
B004XXIHS2|4.0|I love old mystery stories and bought this when it was the Kindle deal of the day.  I had never read anything by Ira Levin before.  I was extremely glad I made the purchase.  This book is very very good.  Once you get into the story it moves at a very brisk pace and the book is very hard to put down.  I found myself thinking about it and wanting to return just so I could figure out what happens next.<br />The story concerns one very messed up killer and the trio of sisters he stalks as he tries to worm his way into their wealthy family.  I don't want to give anything more away because the read is short, full of surprises and twists, and is easily well worth your time.  It is an old fashioned mystery so I'm sure that could be a turn off for some people who are not used to reading older books.  Give it a try.  I'm going to definitely read some more Ira Levin.
B003DFLZB2|5.0|If you're new to the Nolan-trilogy soundtracks, begin with \\"Begins\\". I have all three scores and BB is the best.<br /><br />I just reviewed the new TDKR album and noticed that this first Nolan-series OST album has, in all these years (and as of this writing), racked up only 12 Amazon reviews. Not sure why -- it is popular and well-rated among fans and critics.<br /><br />Bottom line for me: I have been a film-score fanatic for decades, and have accumulated  some of the best soundtrack-aficionado scores in an extensive collection (over 300 ST CDs), including titles by composers such as John Williams and Jerry Goldsmith. However, BB quickly became (and remains) my favorite soundtrack score ever. It's superb genre-irrespective MUSIC, not just a superb stand-alone ST album. I saw the film only 1x, and only because I wanted to hear unreleased music. I'm not a film buff, and I especially didn't care for this film. I am, however, glad that it was produced as the film project concomitantly led to this groundbreaking score.<br /><br />One reason I like it is that the composers very much re-invent musical style. Not that other composers -- even from WAY back -- haven't blended classical intstr. with electronic/computer-based elements. Or incorporated certain \\"sound effects\\" (e.g., whoosh of air depicting bat wings, etc.). But this score combines various elements -- with the added complexity of two collaborating composers -- in an extremely cohesive (=tight), artistic, and (most important) emotion-rich manner.<br /><br />The short samples on Amazon aren't enough to get your feet wet. Go to YouTube. Several fans there have uploaded full-length versions of all tracks on this album. That should help guide your decision on whether this type (style) of music is for you.<br />NOTE: As good as I thought the OST \\"BB\\" CD was, I was more blown away by an unofficial '3-CD expanded score' version which may be found online and is definitely worth hearing.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|The book was very elementary...  It read like a cheap porn movie.  Just wasn't well written.  I was really looking forward to reading this book but it became so predictable that it was borning.
B006RUJST6|5.0|This book totally captured my attention!! Its characters are truly memorable and easy to relate to, while the plot leaves you craving more. Buy the sequel, Point of Retreat, as well. You won't be disappointed! I hope there will be a third in the series!
034580404X|5.0|Let's just say I'm glad Miss Steele is as naive as I am.  When she asked what something was I was feverishly reading for the answer too!  Though I would never put myself in her situation, it has been quite the experience to live vicariously through her!  Hot books.

0345803485|2.0|Here it is- my opinion but this may sway you to skip this series.<br /><br />As an avid reader, I love page turners and can normally finish a good book in about a weeks time.  I was Sucked in by the hype of this one- I downloaded the full three books of this trilogy (unfortunately) about a month and a half ago.  I am only a quarter of the way through book 2.  I cannot get through it and cannot fathom how this is pushing 5 stars with readers.<br /><br />Here's a test.  If you:<br />- Enjoyed the Hunger Games series.  The Da Vinci Code.  Heck even the Twilight series.<br />- Appreciate a book with characters that have a 'hook'. Characters you can relate to, empathize with, be sad with, be frightened with, be happy with..<br />- Like a Plot?<br />- Are a Mature adult who is able to rent porn videos or have enough life experience to not be taken over by some steamy words.<br /><br />If you answered yes to any of the above situations, this series is not for you.<br /><br />I would suggest going to the local Adult book store and spending $5-10 on a porn film.  You get about the same satisfaction for much less time, money and energy.<br /><br />Make this into a movie?  That would be brutal.. and it would have to be sold at the aforementioned store.<br /><br />I am being generous with 2 stars.  I was sucked in so ONE of the TWO stars is props for the MARKETING of this dreadful series.
1609611543|5.0|An excellent book in terms of writing style and content.  Until I was off wheat, I didn't realize how adversely it was affecting my health. After being off wheat, I have so much more energy and seem to need less sleep. I couldn't gain weight even if I tried. I said goodbye to depression, anxiety and pimples.<br /><br />I was completely addicted to wheat as Dr. Davis explained many of us are. At every meal, I had wheat, be it muffins, bread, pasta or pizza. Wheat is \\"among the most consumed grain, constituting 20% of all calories consumed.\\" Variety is the key to a healthy diet and I think the more we eat wheat, the more we will crave it.<br /><br />Dr. Davis is spot on when he says the wheat of today is so much different than it was 50 years ago. Not only is our soil depleted of nutrients, but the wheat today has been genetically modified. This modern wheat also has not been tested for safety.<br /><br />It was also interesting to find out that wheat has a huge mark-up and the cost of marketing products with wheat is way more than the cost of the actual ingredients.<br /><br />Towards the end of the book, Dr. Davis talks about how when you remove the wheat from your diet, you need to fill it with healthy \\"real food\\" and not just junk food.  He defines real food as not being genetically modified, overly processed or grown with herbicides.<br /><br />Dr. Davis also gives practical advice for eliminating wheat and provides some recipes.  You can enjoy pasta, bread and muffins because there are some great wheat-free products. It might be a little adjustment in the beginning, but you will feel much better once you are wheat-free.<br /><br />The one thing I didn't like about the book is how he simplistically led the reader to believe that wheat can cause a lot of illnesses such as diabetes or heart disease. Whereas I do believe that wheat can contribute to illnesses and a host of other conditions, I think other factors are important to consider.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I really like the portability. I was surprised that it isn't a memory hog - even with almost all picture attachments. I use it to track Christmas present ideas and for research when i need to gather information in many formats (photo, video, audio, text, etc.) together. Big help when you need to see the big picture and you only have a number of seemingly unrelated bits of data.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Good to use for Bible study along with what I have. Easy reading and very helpful. Handy to have it downloaded to read any time.
B00884GR0W|1.0|this used to be my favorite game then it updated and it ruined the game DO NOT UPDATE!!!!!! update stinks
B0060AY85C|5.0|A great book from a great author!  My first time through the book, I read quickly, because I needed to know what happened to these characters.  Because of the author's craft, the characters were living breathing people.  I was concerned for them, and needed to know they would be alright.  The second time through, I read to enjoy Toni Morrison's beautiful use of language.
B007UXTG8M|5.0|I watched this last night and had to let it digest before writing a review. This movie was far more painful and powerful than I expected it to be. The performances were excellent and multi-layered. I guess I thought it was going to be more about Brandon's (Michael Fassbender) sexual addiction, but it really was much more about making connections with people, emotional stress, the price of relationships. Yes, he turned to porn and prostitutes for release and relief from his otherwise tightly wound, buttoned up life that was carefully constructed to hide the pain surging beneath. But the real story was the tension between him and his sister, the beautiful and frail but manipulative Sissy (hope I'm spelling that right), whose instability leashed them together. They never talked explicitly about their past, but you knew something had to have happened to them to make them this way. They were like shell-shocked survivors of a war who never learned how to function in \\"normal\\" society. But then the movie also does a great job of peeling back the layer on what is \\"normal\\" as well, when it shows Brandon's married boss having a loving chat with his son one minute, then sleeping with Sissy the next, with no regard for a tortured Brandon in the next room. There is also a flirtatous yet married woman on the subway who is the narrative arc tying together the beginning and end of the tale. Of all of them, Brandon seems to be the one who truly craves a connection with another human being, while everyone around him is just throwing away what comes so easily to them. Very emotional, and really makes you think. Overall, I thought this was a truly masterful and heart-wrenching piece of filmmaking and acting.
B00785P2QC|5.0|an amazing I highly recommend its so fun and a great time passer a lot like Sim city not much bad k can say about this game
B0022Q8CSC|5.0|It is one of those books wchich needs to be read by everyone. Puzo creates complex psyhological profiles of all the characters. You can get in the head of Michael and Vito Corleone and feel like the Don for a few days. You can analize the crimes of Luca Brazi... In the end you can decide who is the good and bad guy. great book
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is the electronic version of the standard calculator anyone would expect to see in an office. I was hoping this calculator was also going to include an option for scientific calculations however I do not believe it comes with these options. It is simply a well-done and user-friendly version of a normal calculator.

B004J4WKUQ|3.0|If your younger than me, and I'm 35, I'm pretty sure you'll scoff at this book.  The dialogue is adolescent and the story is juvenile, that being said, I read it in a whirlwind.  I knew nearly all of the pop 80 references.<br /><br />Reminiscent Fiction is the opposite of Science fiction.  Amazon should rethink this index.<br /><br />I'm smarter, wiser, balder, fatter and more enlightened.  The kids would never allow this to happen.
B003QP4NPE|5.0|This is an impressive debut novel and easily ranks alongside Snow Crash, a personal all-time favorite. Diverse technical and social topics converged with engaging writing. The inspirational resources listed were greatly appreciated and a suggestion other fictional writers should consider.

0307730697|5.0|I bought this book because I enjoy war stories about unsung heroes (past and present) who fight our country's enemies so the rest of us can live in peace.  Yet, the story of Adam Brown raised my admiration to a level I did not think was possible.  What an amazing man; and his loss is a tragedy for all of us even if we did not know him personally.  Adam Brown earned virtual hero worship from his wife, children, family, friends, teammates, commanders and brothers-in-arms.  It almost seems impossible for anyone to reach the level of achievement he did; and not just as a SEAL in the top echelon of our elite fighting forces.  It gave me pause to think how I would stack-up against Adam Brown as a husband, father, brother, friend, patriot and christian believer.  It seems impossible to reach Adam Brown's achievements in every single one of those areas of his life. I was so surprised and impressed by the command Adam Brown had over his personal life that it actually rivaled his achievements as a warrior; the reason I bought the book in the first place.  My compliments also to his family; who were also very impressive; especially his dedicated wife who worked so hard for Adam that she earned hero worship in return.
0545265355|5.0|I absolutely loved these books!  They were so good I couldn't put them down. The books really make you see what's going on and make you feel for these people in all their loses.  These rank up with my favorite books and I would recommend them to anyone who loves action love stories (I guess that's how you could describe this... it was just amazing all around)!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|great fun!!! it is just like the movie. I cant wait to show this game to my kids!!! I ready for another game from this developer.

B0072KZ0Z6|5.0|I can't think of a single show that all of us watch as a family besides the hilarious but for older viewers, Archer TV cartoon on FX.  New Girl is the first show in years where everyone at home was waiting for the next episode.  Each character held our interest, heck, we even enjoyed the pilot with the different African American actor and have grown to love the current actor.  Seeing Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was such a treat and the premise of the show he was on just had us laughing like crazy.  We even went so far as to dvr the episodes and various of us would watch episodes again.  That does not happen that often in this family for a TV series.  This series reminds me of how exciting That Girl was with Marlo Thomas for us when we watched new episodes in the 60's.  Fresh, modern, unexpected.  Shoot 40 or 50 years into the future and New Girl hits a lot of right notes.  The character who likes to keep the house clean and has the surreptitious relationship with Jess's girlfriend consistently makes us laugh.  Our whole household recognized that one should never mess with the one member of the home who is into cleaning.  Just enjoy it baby.  And when he became injured, that recurring joke had us doing our water cooler laughing days later.  We look for a weak link on the show and then they bring in another fun guest like Dermott Mulrooney who has always been a family favorite, ok, my wife is in love with him, and watching his character and his daughter and ex-wife waltz through the episodes were very satisfying.  I can only hold my breath that Kareem might make another guest appearance.  His note was so funny I'm still laughing about it.  We couldn't get bored by the episodes.  The roommate who communicated to himself from the past on an old dvd was such a stroke.  All we know is that now that we no longer have television and only watch dvds (to save money) that at some point it is guaranteed that we will purchase this set and, inevitably, any and all dvd sets of this clever, modern show that is really a perfect vehicle for Zooey.  I watched as Fox turned into an actual TV network and was amazed to see it grow into something that gave real competition to the others.  Ever see the Family Guy episode where the dad goes on and on listing Fox TV series that failed?  That is one funny joke.  New Girl is just what you hope a newer, now established network would bring to the TV viewing public.  Great job Fox and we sure root for you to keep it around for a while because our lives as we try to live them, trying to be good people, trying to live right, trying to follow our faith, find ourselves teetering on the 'no coarse joking' edge (the only reference in the bible I've found that directly addresses humor).  Ok, on occasion we wince, maybe even more than on occasion, at the casual sex subject matter that is matter of factly presented.  We buck up and attribute that to the way of the world (I even change the channel, well, used to, on occasion when Family Guy would just cross the line).  Aside from that, this is our show and we'll bet there's millions more who are enjoying the girl who grabbed our attention singing in Elf and whose cds we've purchased as part of She & Him and who we went to the movies to see for (500 days) of Summer and her perfect role in Failure to Launch.  Finally, getting enough of Zooey on a consistent TV basis.  DVD set, here we come.  God bless., modern show that is really a perfect vehicle for Zooey.

B008393Q2O|1.0|I have had this app on my smartphone for several months.  Tried to complete the download process, endles times but always unsuccessful.  It sounded great but I have never been able to use it.  I have since downloaded another similar app that works great.
0425263908|5.0|Just like the back cover says....if you loved 50 Shades of Grey, you will love this too.  I whole heartedly agree! I can not wait for the 2nd book to come out!  This is another great author who puts a new spin on love/romance/sex. Sylvia Day did a great job at describing everything and I was hooked within the first chapter!  MUST READ!  :)
B008JGSM6G|5.0|So much fun. It is a great game for the whole family. Nothing better than sitting down and trying a fewlevels to relax at the end of the day.
034580404X|5.0|50 Shades of Grey trilogy is the newest version of Pretty Woman....except this character was not a hooker!  What an unbelieve rush!  You love book one...for sure, but by the time you get to book two, you are so enthralled in their lives that you feel you can never put the book down! All the characters lives were so detailed and so exciting. If they ever do decide to make a movie, all females will flock to the theaters for sure.  This was by far the best love story. E.L James did a fanaminal job and I will forever read whatever she publishes! This product came to my house with promptness and was wrapped nicely....I felt it was an early Christmas!<br /><br />This is a must read for everyone!  Women will be happy that their man reads this.....better yet, read it to them!
030758836X|5.0|Nick and Amy's marriage started out just as you would hope, two people deeply in love.  Nick was handsome and care free, Amy was beautiful and the \\"Amy\\" behind her parents 'Amazing Amy' book series which left Amy with quite a little nest egg...<br /><br />but things are not always as they seem....<br /><br />As years go by, things change for the happy couple.  Amy gives the majority of her money back to her parents when they hit financial difficulties, then both she and Nick lose their jobs in New York.  Nick's mom is sick and his dad has Alzheimer's so the couple moves back to Missouri to be close to his parents and start over.  Amy uses the last large chunk of her inheritance to help Nick and his twin sister Margo purchase a bar.<br /><br />Now, on their five-year anniversary a very different couple has emerged from where Nick and Amy started.  They can not seem to connect any more and that morning Nick leaves for his bar, only to receive a call shortly after from a neighbor saying something seems wrong at Nick's home, the door is wide open, the cat who is never allowed outside is on the front step.  Nick comes home to find the living room tore apart, the iron left on, and Amy missing.<br /><br />As a closer look is taken, and with the help of the clues that Amy left for Nick as she does every year to find his anniversary present, Nick soon becomes the prime suspect. Having his own secrets, Nick works with his sister trying to get to the bottom of what happened to Amy.<br /><br />but things are not always as they seem....<br /><br />As the story unfolds.... there is more than meets the eye and a very twisted tale unfolds which really shows that you never know what goes on behind white picket fences and closed doors.<br /><br />Gone Girl is as I said a mystery.  No scratch that... it is a thriller.  But also - not your run of the mill thriller (enter scary man stage left) but add PSYCHOLOGICAL THRILLER to the mix.  Yup... it is a little wacky but oh so good!<br /><br />This is one of those books that are hard to review because it is so masterfully put together you (I) do not want to give anything away that is best for the reader (you) to discover on your own.  Which.. leaves me in the awkward position of saying pretty much...<br /><br />nothing.<br /><br />Let me put it like this, what you think you know... you don't.  When you think you have it all figured out (like I did by page 111), you don't.  You are not even close to the crazy that is happening up in here.  When I told my friend Angie how much I was loving it she asked \\"are you on part 2 yet?\\"  and I responded., \\"There's a part 2?????\\"  I flipped ahead about ten pages and sure enough... the book has a part two, and as long as I am sharing... also a part three.<br /><br />Gone Girl is one of those books you do not want to put down.  I read that first day I picked it up as long as I could into the evening until I felt my eyes droop and I had to stop.  A rarity for me, I read this while standing at the grill the next evening, instead of listening to an audio book.  Folks... this just does not happen.  :shock:  In fact, I spent the better part of two days reading this book in every spare moment I could squeeze out and my thoughts on it went something like this:<br />\\"WHAT?\\"<br />\\"Noooooo....\\"<br />\\"That can't be, ri... oh.  It is.\\"<br />\\"NO WAY!\\"<br />\\"That's crazy!\\"<br />\\"That's brilliant!\\"<br />\\"Oh no he didn't!\\"<br />\\"OH NO, she didnt!\\"<br /><br />Yes, this is my review of Gone Girl.  Fantastic.  Perhaps, the best book I have read in 2012 so far.  It is different than anything I have read before, well through out and now I am seriously curious about author Gillian Flynn's state of mind (kidding, kidding... I think...).  So well thought out... so amazingly put together... I am still sitting here in awe and on my way to see what else she has written.<br /><br />RECOMMENDED!<br /><br />*Note:  Occasional crude language, nothing over the top (I hate that), but it is there and I want you to be aware.nd I want you to be aware.

B006XF5BTG|2.0|First, I think Michael is a nice guy as evidenced by his dutiful responses on the review pages. But frankly, having \\"trained for 10 years\\" doesn't exactly qualify someone to be writing books on the subject. Not that all the info is bad, but much is nothing new and a some of it is old dogma that current research has proven wrong, e.g. drink a gallon of water a day...not necessary or necessarily good for you. And the carb recommendations seem way over the top.<br /><br />There are inconsistencies and downright contradictions as well. He talks about the importance of full body exercises, only to turn around recommend lots of isolation sets in the routines. He stresses how we shouldn't spend so much time in the gym and then tells us to go five days a week! Seriously? Later in the book, in the span of few paragraphs, he says dumbbell bench presses are one of the best exercises you can do...then says he doesn't do them anymore...then puts it in the program.<br /><br />His best information refers to the \\"excellent book, Starting Strength, by Mark Rippetoe\\".<br />He's right. It IS excellent, if not a bit technical in dissecting the lifts. And that in my opinion, is the book you should be reading.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Great games in this set. I have been staying awake to late each night playing instead of studying. more like this needed.
B0074AGVWK|3.0|While I have read all of Maeve Binchy's novels and enjoy her easy style of writing I am getting a bit bored with so many being set in the same streets with the same characters.

B007PVHMCG|4.0|I purchased this for my 9 year old nephew's birthday. He is an avid Minecraft player and he had been dropping hints about wanting this Lego set so being the good Aunt that I am ;) I bought it for him when it was offered for MSRP on Amazon. After receiving the Legos I am surprised by how small the box is (approximately 5.5\\" x 5\\" and has 480 pieces) but I guess that is my fault for not reading the product info. I just assumed it would be a larger set.<br /><br />I feel that the MSRP is a little high for this set but perhaps you are paying for the Minecraft association. I would feel more comfortable paying $20-$25 for this set.<br /><br />However, I know that my nephew will love it so that is all that matters in the end :)He is very careful with his toys so I expect this to last a long time.
B000069AUI|5.0|I must say I'm a huge Coldplay fan, so I'm not ashamed to say that this review is going to be extremely biased. This album is the greatest they've ever created, it holds so much nostalgia for me and is probably my favorite album- besides Radiohead's Ok Computer and Arcade Fire's Funeral. I remember sitting at home when I was younger and just listening to this album over and over again. Bottom line: If I could give 6 stars I would.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I chose this book because everyone was talking about it. And it did not disappoint! It's a MUST READ. Can't wait to start the next one :)

B003PJ6UHA|3.0|The theory is a little hard to take. It seems to play with the explicit meaning of words like \\"sound\\". Because an animal with ears of some kind is not nearby...does that mean there is not compression of air molecules when a tree falls? As people die I have noticed, too that everything goes on. It is logical to say that when I die everything will continue without me, also. The laws of physics has to be a starting point of all observation. This theory takes too many liberties with Quantum Mechanics. We only see what we need to see in order to survive and reproduce, but there is so much more out there and it is driven by the laws of physics. Still, an interesting read.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Great game. me &amp; my son love playing it together.  we try to beat each others scores or just playing to gain points

B007VUA7VO|5.0|straight to the point. very accurate,  and lots of nice colors. lets you know the averages of how much talk time.
B0069UP2PI|4.0|The only reason I'm not giving Contagion a 5-star rating is because I'm not particularly fond of the way the movie ends.  Yes you will see in fine detail the much needed explanation for a deadly virus that attacks millions of people around the world (especially Hong Kong, England and America) but I feel the film ends too abruptly.  Small complaint I suppose, but I didn't see it coming and I would have liked more.<br /><br />Anyway, as you can probably guess by the title of the film, Contagion is about a deadly virus that attacks millions of people around the world... exactly what I mention in the previous paragraph, lol.  There's really not much more to the storyline than that, however what Contagion does remarkably well is contain a perfect balance of drama and suspense.  In fact, while quite often the first half of the film ventures dangerously close to boredom territory by dragging its feet with predictable writing that hardly goes the extra mile to stand out from other deadly virus movies, what it makes up for is keeping the surprise factor intact.  Who will be the next person to come into contact with the virus?  I really enjoyed the mysteries and surprises.<br /><br />Unless I missed something, I can't recall there being an explanation for whatever happened to the woman who traveled overseas and came down with the virus symptoms while staying in her hotel room.  I must have missed a vital segment because it seems unlikely such an important character (at the time, at least) would just be writen off like that.  Then again she *did* sort of resemble Matt Damon's wife so maybe I just got the two faces mixed up.<br /><br />Speaking of Matt Damon, I'm used to seeing Matt run around city blocks and save either himself, or somebody else in dramatic fashion (usually before a bomb explodes!)  In Contagion, he's significantly more relaxed and easy going.  It's because he plays the role of a father, and after losing his wife and son -despite not showing much emotion whichis definitely atypical for *any* human being after such a traumatic experience- he's still going around searching for answers pertaining to the virus but perhaps not *quite* as much as you'd expect.  The storyline definitely switches between several different characters, and does so quite often.<br /><br />Near the end, the suspense seems to disappear and a return to one drama segment after another comes around again.  Not really a problem however.  Perhaps the highlight for me is when Matt throws a prom dance for his daughter and even decorates the living room to make it as realistic as possible (since the schools across the country have been closed down).<br /><br />Anyway my favorite actor is probably the British guy who was able to cleverly expose peoples lies, however that came around to bite him in the behind as you'll discover later on.<br /><br />Overall, excellent drama, decent suspense, lackluster ending.
0887431453|4.0|if anything it could be bigger. 4 yoa grand daughter loves the book and was able to enjoy it unassisted.
B000002868|3.0|The Weather Report is a fantastic jazz band.  If you've heard their entire discography (or at least, the classic mid to late 70's stuff when they reached the height of their songwriting talents) than you already KNOW how awesome these guys can be.  They have the talent to write instrumental jams that are catchy, melodic, adventurous and challenging, and their ability to implement a seemingly neverending supply of musical instruments is my personal favorite reason for being such a big fan of these guys because the more instruments they provide, the more colorful and rewarding the album is in the end.<br /><br />However their debut leaves a LOT to be desired.  There's problems all over the place, the biggest being almost none of the actual notes stick at *all* no matter how many times you listen to this stuff.  Some may defend the lack of memorable notes and claim it's supposed to be a mood album, but I question if creating a mood was really the bands intention when they laid down these songs.  Sounds more like a lack of direction and an uncertainty that they'd be able to catch on with an audience.  It's puzzling because debut albums from the 60's and 70's more often than not are quite rewarding and positive.  This however, is a letdown.<br /><br />\\"Orange Lady\\" is the favorite for many fans, but I truly fail to understand what makes it so special.  The saxophone feels totally wrong- the wrong musical instrument to illustrate beauty and *surely* the wrong instrument to carry the entire 8-minute song.  This is where Miles Davis would have found a way to make it work.  \\"Orange Lady\\" does succeed in one aspect- what sounds like the same sax riff looping over and over is probably not quite the same set of notes each time the sax comes around again.  I really don't like the song though.  \\"Waterfall\\" is guilty of the same execution- a mellow, slowly performed saxophone carrying the entire song but at least in this case there's some tasty keyboard swirls and bass guitar in the background giving the piece an enchanted feeling, so that helps.<br /><br />\\"Seventh Arrow\\" at least benefits by having sax solos that actually jam instead of basing the song around a select set of unmemorable notes that tries to create an atmosphere but ultimately doesn't work (ahem, \\"Orange Lady!\\") and \\"Eurydice\\" is probably the best song here despite not sounding the least bit original and would surely fit somewhere on Miles Davis' Filles de Kilimanjaro album.  Most of the saxophone playing sounds really professional but only clicks about half the time, which is more than enough to make it an improvement over the rest of the material.<br /><br />\\"Morning Lake\\" has a dreamy atmosphere that helps elevate the appeal factor to a higher degree, and you know I actually think the dreaminess and the melodic sax riff works WAY better here than on \\"Orange Lady\\".  Perhaps being only 4 minutes in length is the reason why- shorter and more effective.  Actually the guitar and keyboards remind me of the more mellow sections of the bands famous (and more consistently pleasing) Heavy Weather album.  Interesting similarity there, because those of you who've heard the Weather Report's discography from this album all the way through Heavy Weather know how experimental these guys can be, and yet, if I didn't know any better, I wouldn't be the least bit surprised if this album came out directly before Heavy Weather given how similar they *sound*.<br /><br />The shorter songs are probably the most appealing of the bunch and better fit my tastes.  The funky upbeat rhythm of \\"Umbrellas\\" and the chanting mixed with melodic saxophone swirls in \\"Tears\\" are wonderful highlights and provide us with a hint of what's to come on future albums.<br /><br />Overall... eh.  The Weather Report were clearly better than this.  Even by the time I Sing the Body Electric came out, despite not resembling Sweetnighter or the classic late 70's albums (besides Heavy Weather) at least the band knew how to lay down several exciting and memorable notes.  This album however, lacks focus pretty significantly and therefore can be skipped.ay down several exciting and memorable notes.

B002BU0DPE|5.0|First off, AMAZING! The sound quality is fantastic, the fact that you can use it with the 360 OR PS3 is a huge plus, and, if you don't want to listen to game sound, you can plug it in to anything with a standard sized heaphone jack. The mirocphone is also of high quality. Even if it's away from your face, your friends will easily be able to hear you. Even if it's right on your face, or you like to play with your TV WAY too loud and others in the game can hear it (I'm looking at you, CoD players), you can simply turn the chat volume down so that your mic will barely pick up squat. You can also just mute the mic. It has a bass adjuster, chat enhancer (a semi surround sound), and a nice lengthed cord. I thought it was a little high in price but, I've gladly changed my mind. You won't regret buying these, even if you're only going to use it on your 360 or PC.
B000HVHM5S|5.0|On the off chance that you have not seen V for Vendetta, rest assured that it is not for everyone. Some may feel it is trite or superficial, that it's story about an evil regime is single-faceted, but that, in my opinion, is not what this movie is about. Obviously it is on the surface a work of dystopian fiction wherein the citizenry rises up in the name of freedom at the call of an anonymous messiah, but for me, it is a character-driven romance at heart. And though the romance is subtle enough to not define the genre of this film, the slow growth of love, and its effect on the titular messiah's motivations and actions, are why I love this story.
B0006Z2LCE|4.0|The passing of Donna Summer has given her work a much needed critical review, with mention now of finally inducting her into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame after many years of snubs. This double CD \\"Gold\\" collection is a great overview of her multifaceted and multiple label career, hitting time with all three major labels as well as additional latter singles. The glory days of Casablanca take up all if disc one, the her resurgence on Geffen and comeback on Mercury, finalized by the surprising return to the top ten on Atlantic.<br /><br />Granted, her pairing with Georgio Morodor gave her that first taste of success with the orgasmo-\\"Love To Love You Baby,\\" but you can also see that she was on Casablanca's hit-making treadmill for the first few songs. Summer was blessed with a choirgirl voice, which makes the mediocrity of \\"Could This Be The Magic\\" or \\"Love's Unkind\\" bearable, yet it was when both Summer and Morodor made a quantum leap in style that the duo hit stride. Morodor's electronic pulse and Summer's coo made \\"I Feel Love\\" a song that was decades ahead of the curve, and from that point on, the hits kept coming.<br /><br />Summer and Morodor tweaked the conventions of disco in ways that made Summer's diva-tendencies sparkle, like the ballad-intro to the dynamic \\"Last Dance,\\" or the inventive recasting of McArthur Park\\" into a plaintive dance-floor wail. They were also among the first to fuse rock to their thumpes, with Steely Dan/Doobie Brothers Jeff Baxter laying down that burning solo that made \\"Bad Girls/Hit Stuff\\" irresistible. And how could anyone fight off the dynamic pairing of Summer and the other reigning 70's diva, Barbara Streisand on \\"No More Tears\\"?<br /><br />However, this was about the time Casablanca collapsed under it's own weight, and Summer became one of the first artists to sign with the fledgling Geffen label (whose company at the time included John Lennon and Elton John). Disco was in its death throes, and Summer knew it. Disc Two begins with a turn towards danceable pop. It also marked a cold spell for Summer, as only \\"The Wanderer\\" and \\"Love Is In Control\\" made the top ten after a string of continuous big hits. Some of the material holds up quite well, like her version of \\"State of Independence\\" and the Quincy Jones helmed material. Still, things looked like Summer was going to fade like so many of the other 70's disco mavens.<br /><br />However, Mercury Records claimed that a contract dispute following the collapse of Casablanca meant they were owed an album. Rather than phone in a quickie, Summer responded by turning in \\"She Works Hard For the Money,\\" driving her back to the dance-floors and into the top ten once again. The follow-up single with one-hit Wonders Musical Youth (\\"Unconditional Love\\") is also a winner. Momentum back in her corner, she made another run at Adult Contemporary pop with Geffen that gave a great single (written by Brenda Russell) \\"Dinner With Gershwin\\" and a fine version of \\"There Goes My Baby.\\" But it looked like diminishing returns were coming back to haunt her.<br /><br />That is, until the pop production powerhouse of Stock Aitken Waterman convinced Summer to hook up. Having established a sound with hits by Kylie Minogue and Rick Astley, SAW set Summer up with \\"This Time I Know It's For Real,\\" and lightning hit one more time. The titular album and the follow-up, \\"Mistaken Identity\\" are criminally out of print, as are the Geffen sets, which makes the second disc the best place to get some under appreciated songs. of the rest, \\"Carry On\\" is a deliciously retro-reteam with Morodor, while \\"You're So Beautiful\\" has a deep vibe to it. There's also \\"Dream-Alot's theme\\" recorded specially for \\"The Journey\\" but missing is \\"The Power Of One\\" from Pokemon. All around, though, this is as good as it will get until the inevitable reissue of the OOP albums with bonus tracks and remastering takes placewith a turn towards danceable pop.

B004132HZS|5.0|This is a brilliant production and having the setting be modernized is fascinating and fun.  Clever and witty writing plus the perfect nailing of the aspergery personality of Sherlock Holmes is spot-on and very satisfying!  I love Dr Watson because he is smart, perceptive and has the added warmth and emotion that is needed as a foil to Sherlock.  A perfect match!  The series uses the original stories in an imaginative way so you will see references and nods to Conan Doyle's books.  Well done and well acted.

B003YL4LYI|1.0|I started reading the series after watching the first year of Game of Thrones on HBO. The books were as exciting as the series. I had purchased the four book package and when I finished it, there were too many gaps left open with no path for the reader to follow. Mr. Martin explained that there is a book 5 coming that is actually a parallel to book 4, as there was too much information to be presented.<br /><br />I definitely agreed that there were way too many holes and characters that you care about left hanging at the end. So, I looked forward to book 5, A Dance with Dragons.<br /><br />I have to say it was one of the worst endings to anything I have ever read. It was like \\" I have to finish this, but don't know where to take it. Let's just kill off everyone and throw in more people!\\". Except all the new characters are so disgusting you can't wait for the book to end. Characters that were so important to this series are dead and others that book 4 indicated were killed, seem to walk off happily together in book 5.<br /><br />I did see in the HBO Series, some movement in the second season that deviated from book 2. If there is any hope left, the producers will save Game of Thrones. If they stay on the path of the books, I fear all is lost. Maybe that is what Mr. Martin is trying to convey.

030758836X|5.0|I can say no more than I have said above.  I tried to get this book for some time and now I know why it was never available in libraries and sold out in book stores.  A very sophisticated, mind-bending thriller.  This book just HAS to be a movie.
1933952806|5.0|Darrell Young's recent book on the Nikon D7000 is wonderful and written for the viewpoint of a camera user and not a technical staff member at Nikon.  My advice, if you have purchased the D7000; take the Nikon Manual and store it in the bottom draw of your desk and put Young's book on top of your desk next to your D7000.  You will never get to efficiently use and enjoy your D7000 without this book.  Young answers all your questions, in a manner that you can understand from the get go.  Take your camera, this book and a good glass of red wine or a single malt and truly learn to enjoy our camera.<br /><br />Today, my book is loaded with quick notes and lots of highlighting.  If you ask to borrow my book, my response is, buy your own at Amazon.  Thank you Darrell for teaching my how to use my camera and enjoy it everday.  YES, I recommond purchasing this book!!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Most provocative and vulgar language that I have ever read.  I didn't realize it until I started<br />reading the book.  What a stupid girl.  I feel like I need to<br />be forgiven for downloading it.  I couldn't read the<br />whole thing and definitely will read nothing else written by this author. Written pornography.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I love how my Kindle Fire now looks like a book!  It fits nice and snug! Even though the speakers are covered, it does not effect the sound quality at all! There is a lot of protection for your Kindle Fire and now when I carry it around in my backpack, purse, doggie bag, or my briefcase .... I don't have to worry about anything messing it up! I've been asked \\"What book are you reading?\\", with a happy smile I answer \\"about seven different books at the moment\\".  Then Iam able to show off my Kindle and it's wonderful cover! Thank you for making such a great cover!!
0345803485|1.0|My girlfriends would not stop talking about this book, so I decided to give it a try.  I'm not the kind of person who usually cares for bad romance/erotica novels and I feel that my time is well better served actually learning.  This book is offensive.  My girlfriends raved about the sex scenes and I find them truly disgusting.  Anyone who thinks it's okay to read about a man that is so screwed up that he believes that it's okay to punish someone needs to take a look in the mirror.  This is wrong in every way and should not be promoted.  How this movie will be turned into a book, I don't know.
0345803485|2.0|The book is over 500 pages and you'll breeze through it in a matter of a few days. I gave into the hype and ordered the trilogy. So far I've finished the first one and all I can say is that it is a page turner, but not in a good way. You'll find yourself wanting to see if the book gets better. Anastasia Steele is so naive and young and the entire time I'm just bored with the way she thinks. She's infatuated with a narcisist who's super rich, super gorgeous and did I mention he likes bondage snd is completely incapable of real intimacy. The abundant sexcapades throughout the book were just boring after a while. I bought this ridiculous trilogy and I'm going to finish them but I definitely don't recommend the book unless you are a naive virgin who is curious about bondage. Lol
0385342063|4.0|I enjoyed this book a lot. I downloaded it on kindle and loved it. Kinsella always manages to pull it off. I'm looking forward to her latest. I laughed out loud!
0446585025|2.0|Listened to this book, in audiobook format, this week, as I commuted to and from work. Expected something witty and fun. Unfortunately, the book was full of every garden variety cliche you've ever heard ... Ellen wants us to stop and smell the roses, and to be nice to others. She wants us to be polite, and to recycle more. She advises us ladies to get our mammograms, and those of us over 50 years old to get our colonoscopy. She thinks people's attention spans are shorter today and that people don't curl up with books that much anymore. Very generic advice, nothing new or memorable. So disappointing.<br /><br />She also tries too hard to sound like \\"the average person next door\\". For example, she jokes about how excited she was to get Customer Service to issue a refund for something she purchased. She also says that the reason she moved to different houses so many times in recent years was to avoid having to wash the windows. I'm sorry, but when you're a huge, famous, rich, TV host and celebrity such as Ellen, you don't get to make \\"I hate washing windows\\" jokes anymore. Those jokes just come across as completely fake.<br /><br />She even has a chapter composed of just Ellen making sounds like \\"pop\\". Sorry, I really wanted to find her to be funny. It just wasn't happening. Maybe I just don't fit her demographic. For example, she makes lots of jokes about how everyone's on Twitter these days, and everyone loves reality TV shows (I personally have no interest in either); she also says that people don't curl up with books anymore. (That's not my experience. I read all the time, and so do most of my friends).<br /><br />I listened to two out of the three CDs, just to give it a fair trial. That's all I could take. Anyway, to me, this audiobook was boring and only rarely caused me to chuckle. It might be ok to listen to (or read) for a few minutes at a time, but trying to listen to her cliches for an hour or so is just wayyyy too much for this listener/reader.

America) is turned into a \\"super-soldier\\" by an experiment headed by Abraham Erskine, a famous German doctor and scientist. He goes on different missions to destroy the megalo-maniac Red Skull (Hugo Weaving) and save the world. It has an incredibly surprising ending...You must see it to find out!

B005LLX582|1.0|My wife and I went to see the movie, Tree of Life.  After the first 15 to 20 minutes I was ready to walk out.  I had no clue of what was going on, who were what characters and what was the story line.  All of the speech was in a whisper and the background music successfully covered it up so I had no clue of what was being said.  My wife wanted to stay so I did.  I finally determined it was a story about a dis-functional family.  Fortunately, I fell asleep and was not subjected to any more uncomprehensible sights or sounds of this totally terrible waste of time movie.

0762777931|5.0|This is an interesting and well-written book about eating raw foods, juicing, making the body more alkaline, etc.  I enjoyed Kris Carr's sense of humor.  Lots of what she is doing is controversial, but it is her approach and it is working for her.  She is trying to appeal to the younger population who have been diagnosed with cancer, but I bet there are a lot of us 50's and over that are reading this book.  I wouldn't be surprised if the 50+ folks are the main purchasers of this book.  I would have liked to have seen some scientific evidence on alkalinity.  When I search on google, scientists seem to dispute the idea of having an alkaline body; they say that the urine can change, but most of the rest of the body stays within a certain range for that particular organ. As a result of this book, I have started juicing (about 4 weeks now), but I haven't reached a verdict as to if I feel better.  I juice one meal/day.  I have lost 10 lbs and hope to lost 5 more.  My partner has been diagnosed with Stage 4 colon cancer, and has chosen chemo since it has the most scientific backing for prolonging life.  She has had one round of chemo and all the healthy foods are not tolerable right now.  Whatever adds calories and protein seems to be what is important now.  I hope at some point she can get back to healthy eating. I would like to see results of a raw foods diet from folks who have advanced colon cancer and don't choose chemo or radiation.
030788743X|5.0|I was born in 1965, and grew up as a nerd, back when being a nerd was not cool.  This book takes me back, and I can't say how much I loved it.<br /><br />Also I recommend the audible version.  The reader (Will Wheaton) is just great.
0307887448|5.0|I don't enjoy video games, I am on a needs-to-know basis with my laptop, and I don't (usually) enjoy science fiction. Having stated those facts I want to say I absolutely loved this book. The pace, originality, and just over-arching draw of the characters and plot drew me in and forced me to finish it in 2 days. I normally am a historical fiction nerd- and those books don't generally move quickly- this one barely gives you a breath to put it down. This book is for anyone- to those who will gleefully enjoy all 80s references (I being 5 years younger than the Halliday character got most) to those younger ones into virtual reality gaming. Do not pass this one up.

We bought this as part of my younger -- 16-year-old -- Grandson's birthday present.  I consider it the definitive Shepard Fairey book.  Fairey recently came to our hood and painted some public murals.  My younger Grandson recently got his driver's license and car and makes a point of driving by the closest mural and pointing it out to his passengers.  My Grandson also bought me one of the limited-edition Obey Dirk posters, celebrating Dirk Nowitsky and the Dallas Mavericks' 2011 World Championship.  We are all big Mavs fans and go to their games and other events as often as we are able.

B0060MYM7O|5.0|Season 1 was 90% faithful to the book.  Season 2 is 70% faithful to book.  Subjective as to how certain arcs and characters are handled.  No one cares because objectively, the series/season is masterfully written, acted, directed, scored.<br /><br />Only complaints from me:<br /><br />- Meera and Jojen Reed and Edmure and Brynden Tully are held back for another season.  In books, Edmure Tully is in part responsible for Tywin Lannister being close enough to King's Landing to rush back with the Tyrells when Stannis besieges the capital.  Sensible for show creators to not pour all the characters in all at once and have them \\"standing around doing nothing\\".<br /><br />- Not enough Freys
B007J4T2G8|1.0|First of all, the AUTHOR, which in E.L. James case is used very loosely. I guess E.L. got lucky that older American women (who are obviously disappointed with their sex lives) are afraid to pick up a romance novel. At least romance novels are written by actual authors who are intelligent and know how to put together an interesting read. It was a miracle that I finished the entire book, because I felt my intelligence leaving me as I read each page. Also, E.L. James, I don't think the Twilight series you copied by Stephanie Meyers were exceptionally written, but at least I enjoyed them. And who does she think she is writing E.L. James. Trust me honey, you are not the next J.K. Rowling!!!

0199235694|4.0|I could copy paste one of my reviews of other Very Short Introductions into this review.  It's short, easy to read, and a very good introduction.  Particular to this VSI was the introduction which sought to define what modernity was before using it to explain Modern Japan.  I learned more in that section than is some of the other VSI books.  The rest of the book moves between the so-so beginning (a description of Japan in the years leading up to modernism) and the quite good end (actual modern Japan in all its complexities).  Overall, worth the read.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Couldn't put it down.  Great storytelling with many surprises. You feel the suffering and hope of the characters. I Can't wait to read more stories from this author.
1416550534|2.0|Soooo did anyone else notice that this is basically Margaret Atwood's The Blind Assassin...?<br /><br />With almost the exact same plot (just with more cliche english servants), it almost feels like Atwood should be thanked in the acknowledgements for providing Morton with a plot line.... (Morton DOES suggest The Blind Assassin as part of her further reading list... \\"If you enjoyed my book, then perhaps you'd like to read the original! Thanks, Margaret! Couldn't have done it without you.\\")<br /><br />While everything else smacks too loudly of The Blind Assassin, Grace is wholly Morton's invention. Which makes it more disappointing that she's so tiresome.... from her 'aha!' moments that the reader could see coming from page 5, to her long drawn out narrative of things that leave you wondering \\"I'm sorry, where are you going with this...?\\", you start wishing that Morton would give the narrative reins to one of her more interesting characters.<br /><br />I liked The Forgotten Garden, so was disappointed by Riverton. 2 parts Blind Assassin, 1 part poorly written BBC melodrama, The House at Riverton doesn't live up to the high ratings.

B003ICWTTM|1.0|This has got to be the worst sounding BluRay that I've ever watched. There is no bass, vocals are way too up front, A/V sync is off by more than my receiver can compensate for. A real disappointment for me.... a huge embarrassment for Springsteen. I can't believe that he allowed it to be released.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game challenges you over and over in every level.  When I first got this app I couldn't put it down.  It's fun and challenging to people of all ages!
0316019984|5.0|I got this for<br />My 5 year old and he loves it along with my 8 yr old.  There are multiple pop-ups on each page and even a light on one page!!  Would not be good for small children, as they would want to tear it up and it's so intricate that it's not sturdy!!
B007GATVYI|2.0|There is no way to zoom in on this book with my kindle. That really creats huge problem reading the tiny small font of the book!<br />This book DOES NOT fit Kindle reading!
B008MEM24S|5.0|I had a blast playing this game and recommend it to anyone who likes a challenging puzzle like portal or the new quantum conundrum.
1452101426|5.0|I have a ton of 'art of\\" books and I absolutely love this book, as this is the kind of movie perfect for an art of treatment.  Full of great sketches and insight into the characters.  Perfect companion if you saw and loved the movie.
B008CLI3TE|4.0|I've never read G.R.R. Martin(the sheer length of the books being a bit daunting), so I sat down to watch the first season of Game of Thrones with no preconceptions or understanding of what was going to happen. Simply put, from the first episode, I was hooked.<br /><br />While I can understand why some people could be turned off by the violence/sexual content--and the sex often was gratuitous to the actual storyline, Game of Thrones still features some of the best acting I've seen on TV in a long time, with Sean Bean bringing back his \\"Boromir\\" look to the utterly brilliant role of Ned Stark. He and Peter Dinklage are easily the best male actors in the series, followed closely by Iain Glen.<br /><br />The story is truly epic and the show does it justice--I don't even want to imagine the production costs that went into it--but the scenes live with a feel for the world that is Westeros. Well done, and I'll probably start watching Season 2 in a couple of weeks.
1781161097|5.0|Love all the preliminary sketches for costuming, the alien ships and landscape.  The scope of the sets were very interesting to see.  The movie was such a masterpiece and having the book helps fill in the intricate details of things you missed in the action.  From beginning to end, this is a book anybody interested in the Alien franchise movies, or any sci-fi movies for that matter, will LOVE!!!

B004XQO8VO|5.0|This movie is one of our all time favorites.  Plenty of action plus a lot of comedy too.  We owned the DVD of this movie for years and just bought the Blu-ray.  It's well worth the low price to upgrade.  Much better picture and sound than the standard DVD.
B0086700CM|4.0|fun game. sometime its not responsive to the actions I give. but other than that it is fun. I recommend it.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|What is all the hype about?! I love to read and I do not like to give bad reviews but honestly I was appalled by this book. Not only was the story itself unrealistic, and poorly written but the characters were quite under-developed. You recognize a book is great when you can almost feel like the characters are real to you, when you can laugh, cry, get angry or feel some sort of emotion. The only thing I felt was disgust. The characters language and actions make them appear unintellegent, psychotic & just plain dumb. This kind of thinking, writing, television etc. is exactly why society is sinking further. Women don't know their worth, men don't know how to be honorable and it's a sad truth. I highly reccommend NOT filling your mind with this type of nonsense.
B00845MRKE|1.0|One of my favorite films, period, I have owned this film in every home video format since Beta - yes, I even own three laserdisc versions of it.<br /><br />This seems to be a simple repackaging of Warner's AMAZING 2007 release - which should remain the final home video version until holographs become the next medium.<br /><br />Until then, I ask for special consideration that, as a token of appreciation to all who have been so devoted to BLADE RUNNER since 1982 by supporting all of its home video releases, please send me a copy of this in October if it an absolute must have!
B007SGM084|1.0|Truly this is low class poorly written literature at its worse. How in God's green earth did this garbage make it to the NY times best seller list? I'm convinced that this trilogy has simply been a bad joke. No way can such a repetitive, redundant, distasteful, poorly written novel make it to a top seller list, nah. I feel sorry for those that &#34;loved it&#34; & were the butt of the joke. My IQ went down just opening the book. I have never hated fictional characters as I do these. I'm sure the author along with all of britain is laughing at all of the foolish Americans with no common sense raving about this trash. It's really a very sad thing to observe the state of our Nation The bad they call good, & the good they call bad. smh
030758836X|2.0|This novel can be very engaging and absorbing. It is also manipulative and deceptive. Approximately a quarter of the book is a complete lie. This monumental deception serves no purpose other than to manipulate the reader; it plays a very small and unnecessary role in the plot of the second part of the novel. And it is not an example of unreliable narrator. In the case of an unreliable narrator the reader knows or strongly suspects that the narrator is deluding himself or herself, or intentionally hiding facts or lying; this is part of the interest and pleasure of books like The Remains of the Day. The novel contains some vacuous social commentary about the Great Recession and media. If you are not bothered by the deception, don't take seriously the social commentary, and go along with a puzzling character (sociopaths in love?), then you will enjoy it.

0891419063|5.0|After 40 years of reading about World War II and military history in general, I've just finished the best war memoir out there. \\"With The Old Breed\\" -- which along with Robert Leckie's \\"Helmet for my Pillow\\" was relied upon for the HBO mini-series \\"The Pacific\\" -- is in a class by itself. Want to know what it's like to be Marine? Want to read what war is really like? Want to get a taste for what action in the Pacific theater looked, smelled, sounded and felt like? Read this book. There is no way one could read this book and ever forget it. This book, in its spare, unpretentious prose, details action on Peleliu and Okinawa and absolutely blows away Leckie's account, which read more like an artsy-fartsy satire and failed to capture the esprit de corps of the United States Marine Corps. By turns chilling, gruesome, heartbreaking, exciting and captivating, the book is impossible to put down. If you decide to read only one war memoir, this should be it. Never has there been a book that precisely details the debilitating effects that war has on the body, mind and spirit. It's a unique and terrifying look inside hell, plain and simple. Filled with pride, pathos and a faith in one's brothers in the Corps, this book will mesmerize you for years to come. Not only will you never think about war or its participants the same, you will hardly be able to believe people can live through trauma like this. You will never get closer to the realities of war unless you go there yourself. Don't waste any more time thinking about it. This book is the first and last word in accounts of its kind. Buy it!
0307949486|4.0|This is a terrific and terrifying tour-de-force in the vast plains of culture, mystery, and journalism. Larsson's first novel in the Millennium Trilogy is a stunning tale of an age-old mystery and an investigation into the bowels of corruption and intrigue that permeate a wealthy Swedish family. I found the novel slow to get rolling. It takes such a considerable amount of time for the characters to move along that I'm reminded of how it feels to wake up in the morning: the long lethargic stretch, followed by a pause, and then a slow staggering out of the bedroom. I won't spoil any details, except to say that financial journalist Mikael Blomkvist is convinced to take on a job by Henrik Vanger to ghostwrite his autobiography and solve the locked-room on an island mystery of the disappearance of his niece, Harriet Vanger in the sixties. He is teamed up with the antisocial, problematic, and unquestionably brilliant hacker Lisbeth Salander, the girl with the dragon tattoo.<br /><br />I don't know how much time Larsson spent developing the central mystery that envelops the life of Henrik Vanger, an obsession that totally eclipses everything else, but it is an intriguing one and tasteful in its execution. For Henrik, Harriet is dead, even if her body was never recovered, nor the method of her death proven. The questions that remain for him are: who, why, and how? Those questions are dissected in the novel through the eyes of Mikael, and later through his partner, Lisbeth. It was a treat to watch Larsson handle his characters, shaping them into realistic and distinct persons.<br />Larsson's attention to detail is superb, the trait any mystery or thriller author requires. Needless to say, I was impressed by the level of detail and analysis that went into the investigation part of Harriet's disappearance.<br /><br />Like I said before, this book is somewhat slow. That is probably my only grievance, but it isn't much of one at all. During my first read-through, it seemed to take countless pages before any real tension; any drama began to seep through the pages. In fact, Lisbeth and Mikael are on two wildly different and completely disconnected paths until quite late into the novel when Lisbeth helps tackle his case. The author also spends a lot of time giving exposition to relevant history and to a host of terminology and processes in the financial world and technology.<br /><br />Though Larsson takes his time to build up the story, the suspense is gripping in the latter half of the novel. Larsson indeed breathes a potent vibrancy into his writing. Translated into English from Swedish, the prose retains some non-americanisms that ring in the ear. Just from reading aloud the dialogue and the supporting texts, the prose is decidedly euro-centric and quite refreshing. Most of the novels I've consumed are North American or English, and though I'm quite new to the game of Scandinavian thrillers, I have to say I like what I've read so far.ke countless pages before any real tension; any drama began to seep through the pages.

B002WN35DC|1.0|The book (El Principito) is a great story that really captures the imagination of childhood.  However...<br /><br />The Kindle version does not include illustrations, which are pretty essential to this story.  It kind of renders the book meaningless, or at least fairly confusing.  This is a fairly pathetic effort to adapt the book to Kindle and a bit deceptive.<br /><br />The Kindle version was recently lowered in price, perhaps to reflect its poor quality.  However, it's still a pretty lame version.

B00001ZT6Z|4.0|By the time 1989's Headless Cross was released most hard rock and metal fans had left Sabbath for dead. I will admit I had low expectations for anything new from Sabbath by 1988. When I heard that Cozy Powell had been recruited as the new drummer I took it as a good sign. Still, I never would have imagined that Sabbath would come up with one of the strongest albums of their career. That's exactly what Iommi and Co. did  with this release. In comparison to the previous few efforts by Sabbath you can tell right away that Iommi slaved over this project in order to get it right. This is the first album since 1981's Mob Rules that actually \\"feels\\" like a Sabbath album. Tony Martin is a dynamo on vocals, and at times he will remind you of Ronnie James Dio with his more operatic approach than his 2 predecessors Hughes & Gillan. The songs are quite strong and the drums (on the original release) are bombastic. Cozy Powell does a fine job. Sabbath brought in session musician Laurence Cottle for all bass duties on the album, and veteran bassist Neil Murray (Whitesnake) was brought in for the tour and subsequent album. This is simply Black Sabbath's best album (at the time) in nearly a decade. Far better than The Eternal Idol, and unfortunately far better than anything they would ever do with Tony Martin at the helm again.<br />  There are many fans who only consider Sabbath to be real if Ozzy or Ronnie James Dio is fronting it, and I do understand that sentiment. This album is worthy of the Sabbath legacy though. If you're open minded it would be a shame if you overlooked it. A truly great album from a legendary band.

0316019984|5.0|I first discovered this book at the local library and insisted on checking it out, only to discover, days later, it is a reference book.  So, I set my heart on buying it.  I have not been disappointed.  It takes a moment to train some of the pages to re-fold properly.  However, I have only love and pride in ownership.  Matthew is my SUPERHERO.  I happily anticipate owning all of his books.
1400069289|4.0|Charles Duhig's book examines a very powerful force in everyday life namely the eponymous Power of Habit. Duhig effectively introduces readers to the concept of the habit loop, giving us detail on the three components that create a habit- the trigger, the action, and the reward. Using this framework, Duhig looks at a number of examples from individual actions through to corporate and societal behaviors. I found his treatment of Paul O'Neills turnaround at Alcoa to be a particularly fascinating examination of how attention to seemingly minute details can have a much larger impact on the culture of a company. That said, some of Duhig's examples, while narratively interesting, don't seem all that obviously connected to the framework he presents in the beginning of his book.<br /><br />Nevertheless, The Power of Habit is certainly worth the read. Much like Malcolm Gladwell, he chooses colorful examples to illustrate his theory. Additionally, Duhig does take the often-ignored leap of trying to offer practical advice on how to apply this framework to changing habits in the reader's life.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|Absolutely loved this story and the 2 that followed. Easy reading with twits and turns that will keep you glued to your kindle!! Would recommend it!!!
B008C20TDG|4.0|I wish everyone would read this book. Western society has unfortunately been lead to believe many things about our current diet that are just wrong. And much of that has led directly to the obesity epidemic. The fact that all that has been strengthened by the food industries drive to find ever cheaper methods of production has also provided incentives for them to lobby our politicians not to publicly change any of that advice despite its obvious harm. It is a self fulfilling, ever strengthening spiral to massive obesity.<br /><br />This book provides a very good framework for assessing what foods are good for us and bad for us and why. There are a lot of parallels to the Paleo diet but this tries to provide a little more scientific basis for their framework. The explanations are mostly clear and written, as close as you get get while still being grounded in science, in an accessible way for a broad audience.<br /><br />I really like the design of the book as well. It's almost a magazine-like layout with lots of sidebars and linked explanations. And there are lots of summaries and re-statements as an aide to learning. If you've read Melissa Joulwan's Well Fed it's a very similar design.<br /><br />The scientific underpinnings to this book are clear in the number and breadth of citations and references. In fact there are 21 pages of small font references at the end of the book. That's good to see, (although as always the reader has to critically asses whether it is a balanced view - I think it is) but dont think that that hampers the text of the book or makes it dense and hard to read - it doesn't.<br /><br />So what didn't I like?<br /><br />I didn't like the some elements of the writing style. It is too reminiscent of the endless long winded emails and web sites that try and persuade you to buy supplements or other self help items. Too much high-fiving and urging and attempts at motivational speaking. While it is in no way overwhelming it became a little jarring attimes and the book would have be better for simply removing it.<br /><br />I also think that the chapters that they themselves said are \\"science-y\\" could have benefitted enormously from some simple diagrams. I've read a lot about insulin, leptin and the other hormone linkages that they discuss in the book. And I still found that just trying to follow the explanations as text hard. Supplementing that by showing the links with diagrams would have made a big difference. I'm sure that itself isnt easy but maybe worth thinking about for a revision of the book.<br /><br />I was also less than convinced by the part on legumes. It felt to me that, while there is some research to support the view that they shouldn't be part of a healthy diet, it was less substantiated and supported than other parts of the book.<br /><br />But they all pale into insignificance in relation to the overall benefits people should get if they read this book. Enabling people to cut through the politicised food advice and helping them really understand the links between their food and all sorts of ailments is a hugely good thing. The general simplicity of their framework and the fact that it has worked for many, many people should make this a standard text for all.
0345803485|5.0|I was given this book by my friend \\"Midge\\" from my church group. Midge is not her real name by the way. Well, I must admit that some of the themes and actions of this book, made me blush.<br /><br />I'm still not sure what \\"fisting\\" is and I don't think I want to know. Now I was raised as a Christian and there is no way Jesus would ever let one human being do that to another. I've been married for more than 30 years and I can assure you that my husband Earl and I do enjoy the sacred act of love on many occasions and even once invited our friends Sherry and Dale to watch us one time. Dale was into it but Sherry was sort of creeped out by all the body hair on my husband. I have fond memories of that evening, but we never really talked to Dale and Sherry after that. They split up and he moved to Chattanooga where I heard he is down on his luck.<br /><br />I recommend this book only to people with very open minds who can overlook poor writing and thin characters. Not thin like a supermodel, thin as in they don't seem like real people and it's all sorta contrived and I don't much like a contrivance.

0345803485|1.0|Several of my coworkers were reading this book, and I kept saying that I wasn't going to read it.  But there I was one Sunday night, and I was bored, and decided to download it.  It is horrible.  It is terribly written, the characters are not likeable and not believable.  The sex scenes are completely unrealistic (how many women have orgasms at the drop of a hat??).<br /><br />But yet, I couldn't stop reading it.  And then I read the other two books in the trilogy and they were equally as bad.  A lot of wasted money.  But entertaining?  Yes, they were.

1439153663|4.0|This is the story of a young girl, Lavinia, who while seven years old, onboard a ship from Ireland, loses her family. In the first pages of the book, she is being taken by the master of a plantation to work at his home as a servant. She is placed with the slaves, grows up with strong, Black women who, while battling their own demons, teach her about life and love. I have found that long after I read this, the characters stayed with me. It's not a happy, feel-good book, but is historically accurate, as far as I know, for the times. It reminds me very much of \\"The Help\\" but goes more into the heart and mind of the oppressed. I found myself very vested in what would become of Lavinia, Papa, Belle, and Mama. Plenty of action to keep the story moving along. Well worth the read.
014312093X|5.0|I am not someone who reads spy novels.  However, this book is literature that happens to concern the spying game during the Cold War.  It is wonderfully written, lyrical in parts, and filled with excellent characterizations.  The author's virulent anti-Americanism had not completely clouded his vision when he wrote this.  Highly recommended.
1400079144|3.0|Well, after reading Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons, I thought it would be much better as even more expertise will be gained. However, At the end, after finishing this one, i definitely felt that was very tired and did not receive a sense of accomplishement. I thought it would be much more interesting. However I ould like to mention some aspects of this book. Firstly, I do feel that some chapters should not have been there, because It was difficult to change to the characters on every chapter. In reality, I do consider an Author to have over -tried to include all his knowladge about Masons and etc. It was very disturbing to read so many theoretical information and Malakhs feeling. Well while describing this very character, It comes to my mind that in Da Vinci Code Silas is described in the same way.  The Book, however, made me continue reading because of realizing that I had read Da Vinci Code and I liked the Plot (Not what is there described though) and here at first I thought I was reading Eniclopedia as the Plot did not go smoothly for about 150 pages. (I could have stopped reading if I did not know the writer's popularity)  Well, at the end I can only say that it is not as good as I thought, had thought the finish would be more interesting and amazing.. but no. well, It is still OK.. I will consider his next books

B0087OSP0S|5.0|I have been a fan of Janet Morris and her literary creation known as Tempus Thales longer than I can recall or she would like me to say. The re-workings being done in the realm of Sanctuary and The Sacred Band are nothing short of brilliant. This is a taste to whet your appetite and will have you scooping up [[ASIN:0985166835 The Fish the Fighters and the Song-Girl: Sacred Band of Stepsons:  Sacred Band Tales 2 (Volume 2)]] before the screen fades on your Kindle.<br /><br />What I enjoy most about these stories are the amazing depth. It is like Dr. Who in that somebody you meet in passing may just show up later to be of great importance and it will take you a few head scratches as you try to remember where this character seems familiar. The cast here is vast and requires the reader to do something that many have forgotten how: LET GO. This story (as with all the others in this glorious mythology) demands that you pay all your attention. The beauty is, you WANT to because it is so vivid and detailed. These are not simply characters, but PEOPLE. You come to know them and this is a tribute to the masterful writing of Ms. Morris because she will be given no leeway if she were to write anything that was against the nature of these people you come to know as a reader.

Paul Newman, the demi-god of two centuries of cinema, and eternally inimitable Bruce Campbell (xxxooo) promote this  from \\"an awe-inspiring coen brothers/sam raimi film feast\\" to \\"unforgettable and untoppable genre tribute film\\" (tim and jennifer are pretty good too).  The plot and humor are literally priceless.  If there were only one DVD, it would be hanging in the Louvre.

And a word of caution wear safety glasses as there are fine glass particles released as you score the bottle. Works well with one time around the bottle. Another point to watch for is the the ridge that is in some bottles from the glass mold. This portion on some bottles appears to be much thicker than other areas and requires more practice to get it correct.

0143123173|5.0|Having watched and fallen in love with the new AMC series \\"Longmire,\\" I was happy that this title became available as a Kindle \\"Deal of the Day.\\" I happily downloaded it and was more than pleased with my choice.<br /><br />Walt Longmire, the sheriff of Absaroka County, Wyoming, is a Vietnam veteran and lawman with a frontier-like way of doling out justice. He patrols the Wyoming countryside in his pickup, is trying to get over the death of his wife from cancer, and living in a house that's only half-built that he quit working on after the her death.<br /><br />This book concerns the deaths of young men who raped and brutalized a young Indian girl several years before. Unfortunately, they were only given a slap on the hands by the judge. Now, someone has come forward to avenge the Indian girl. The list of suspects is long, since there are so many in the county who disliked the young men and feel that they got away without any significant punishment for their deeds.<br /><br />Henry Standing Bear as Walt's best friend is there to assist him in finding the suspect. But Henry is also a suspect as he is related to the brutalized girl.<br /><br />Deputy Victoria (Vic) Moretti is also there, having relocated from Pennsylvania with her estranged husband. She is experienced with guns and ammunition and plays a significant role in the book as Longmire's trusted Deputy.<br /><br />There is plenty of action in the book. Of course, the motive for the murders is revealed near the end and I felt the book had a bit of a weak ending, but for a first novel in the series, this is a worthy effort. The cast is introduced and I am sure will be further developed as the series continues, as in the TV show.<br /><br />The descriptions of the land and settings are beautifully drawn. There is a bit of the supernatural in this book, yet it does not take away from the realism, but enhances the Native American feel.<br /><br />I look forward to reading the next book in the series as well as enjoying the TV series.

1441866868|3.0|Upon finishing The Windup Girl I realized that I liked the book much better towards the end than I did when I started it. I felt the book was very dull and dry.....full of mean-spirited characters. Then, along came 'The Windup Girl' Emiko.....and she made the book a much better story to read. I found myself being intrigued and interested in all that she said and did. She was so human-like and I wanted her to really be human because she was so much a better person than those living in the book.<br /><br />There was a lot of horrible and disgusting abuse towards Emiko....especially a very savage rape scene that left me shuddering and sickened by it. It is interesting how human nature responds to something that is seen as less than the beings that we are......how we can abuse and use something or someone that we feel is trash or way beneath us.<br /><br />I felt that the way the story was written.....all the characters were hard to discern if they were good or bad....each had good qualities that shined at times and then very poor qualities that would make the reader disappointed in their choices.<br /><br />Overall......the book was confusing at times and you could never keep track of who was winning the war because the sides changed so much...it gave you an image of a world full of despair and people who would basically do almost anything to stay alive in it. I thought the book was dry at first but did pick up speed halfway through...but it really wasn't my favorite type of read.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|Why must Lucas do this to his most loyal fans. How can you change the movies we've loved so much. If you're a fan of the old trilogy I wouldn't recommend getting this. Yes the blu ray version is crisp but there are so many changes that Its completely noticable and It really ruins the movies. I was left several times rewinding parts and saying \\"what the hell\\". I could list them but theres quite a bit (like Obi Wan letting out a wierd computer generated yelp at the sand people). This was a huge dissapointment and a slap in the face to all the fans of the original series.---Unfortunatly I have no solution to you If you want the original series on a blu ray quality setting. There was a fan site offering it for free (fans went and made the original series in HD)but alas that site is no longer but maybe if you search long enough you might be able to find it. Maybe one day Lucas will release the Original series but we can only hope.
B004CLYKLI|3.0|Reading this book made me think of some of my childhood friends who always excelled in school.  I now wonder if their parents had a similar parenting style as Ms. Chua?<br /><br />I know so many are horrified by this book.  While I admit the push and drive for excellence Ms. Chua demanded from her girls was extreme (to me), it did make me think of parenting today and how lax it is in comparison.  While I consider myself pretty strict, the one thing I learned from this book is that its not necessarily bad to expect more from my child.  I do not think I would spend hours forcing practices and have screaming matches.  Not my style.  However, pushing him where he needs it may give him the extra shove he needs to accomplish something he didn't think he could.  Another stark contrast is the focused time on the children.  I don't know too may parents who would sacrifice hours upon hours a day for practicing.  Shuttling from one sport to another, maybe, but being involved every minute?  Not so much.<br /><br />I think for any parent this is a good and interesting read.  You may not agree, but you may find yourself thinking that somewhere there is a happy medium.
030788743X|4.0|This novel is captivating, especially to those of geeky inclinations. One could enjoy this novel without them but they just make the book more fun. It not the best written thing but Cline knows how to tell a story. You'll find yourself flipping page after page and delving into chapter after chapter. Perhaps it ends a little predictably but that doesn't have to be a bad thing. Overall just a fun novel.
0670022705|5.0|I stumbled on this book on Amazon, read all the reviews, and couldn't decide if I was ready to spend the money - there were concerns that the picture quality is not so good. So I decided to download the free podcast first and see if I like the program in the first place. (Make sure to download them from BBC's website or iTunes - They are free mp3s and you can burn them onto a CD, instead of buying the overpriced audiobook version)<br /><br />I listen to the program when I commute to/from work, and I absolutely love the program, so much that I look forward to getting into the car in the morning. So I ordered this book the next day. I read somewhere that the British Museum and BBC spent 4 years making the program. There are plenty other reviews here talking about the content itself, so I will focus on the quality of the book.<br /><br />As mentioned earlier, I was concerned that some reviews mentioned the picture quality was not so good. I completely disagree. The book itself is very handsome and would look good on any bookshelf. The pages are thick and matte, and you can tell the paper is of very nice quality. In fact, the paper quality is higher than any other hardcover i own. All pictures are taken against a black background. Some of the objects have more than one picture, taken from different angles or of close-up views. For example, if there are inscriptions on an item, there will usually be an additional picture showing a close-up view of the inscriptions.<br /><br />I listen to several programs a day without looking at the pictures first. Using MacGregor's vivid description, I conjure up images of these items in my head. As soon as I get home, I flip through the book to look at the actual pictures. I find that I have a much deeper appreciation for these images when I have a thorough understanding of the objects in them.<br /><br />If you are interested in history, you will love this book like I do.
B0000VCZKW|5.0|I purchased this movie after reading the book. It's slightly different from the book, but equally delightful and entertaining, something the whole family can enjoy.

B007LNJ4YW|4.0|I loved the previous releases. They have been with me through tough times and helped me heal, as corny as that might sound. Troll me not. I was extremely curious where else could Beach House take the low fi drums, guitar + organ sound. And I have to admit that the first couple of times I heard this album I was disappointed. It seemed to be more of the same with less of the profound melancholy that made the previous outings so special. Mainly due to the 'over production'. Little did I know, the album only makes sense on a decent system and the mp3 + ipod combination were only revealing a fraction of the picture.<br /><br />Once I popped the CD into my home system the deep bass, the depth of Victoria's voice (coming from the wall instead of the speakers) and the holographic quality to the entire soundstage made everything fall into place. Unsurprising tunes like 'lazuli' gained epic proportions, weight and character. Finally I got it. In their previous albums production was never such an integral part of the MUSIC, well for this one you need a decent sounding system imo.<br /><br />The only reason I'm giving it 4 instead of 5 is because I wish they incorporated a bit more harmonic and/or rhythmic interest. But that has to do more with my expectations than with the style of the band. They are, by all means, at the top of their game.

B001202VDQ|4.0|I wanted to get into Opeth and this album is an excellent way to appreciate more this outstanding band.<br />\\"Ghost of Perdition\\" and \\"The Grand Conjuration\\" are simply must-listen-to tracks.<br />The rest are softer and melodic, but the growl vocals are still around and powerful like in \\"Reverie/Harlequin Forest\\".<br />Worth buying for sure.
B005IQZB14|4.0|I enjoyed the story as well as the author's writing style. She courageously reveals many parts of herself in a matter-of-fact manner that doesn't over dramatize or understate her history. I'd recommend it.
B005O7PSRO|5.0|Castle Season 1 is quite enjoyable, even seeing the shows for the second time.  You forget some of the early interaction between Beckett and Castle, which is one of the main reasons I think the show is great.  If you are a Castle fan, this is a must have.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|I wish some of the characters were likeable.  On the plus side, it did hold my attention.  I found the main character to be a jerk.  The parents were pathological, and ultimately nothing was resolved.  \\"Jacob\\" was never helped..., ugh.  Wouldn't reread or recommend.  But I was able to push through to the finish.
0345803485|2.0|I just can't get over the dialogue in the book! Who actually says someone's name every time there are words spoken between each other? Dear E. L James, don't worry, your audience isn't that STUPID and they will know who's speaking. Give us a little credit.<br /><br />The \\"Mr. Grey\\" and \\"Miss Steele\\" thing is a huge turn off after a quadrillion times of repetition within just 50 pages. Less is more. Anyways, they are in their twenties, meeting to have coffee and all(so they should technically be on a first-name basis),...so act the part!<br /><br />The thoughts following the dialogue is a bit irritating as well. Who constantly says \\"oh crap\\" or it's many versions every 5 seconds? They act and think more like teenagers trying to play \\"adult.\\"<br /><br />The low score is because the diction/dialogue was so irritating to me, it was hard to actually get to the desirable bulk of the story (the romance) that made it a bestseller.
B00846REIS|5.0|This is a great read, and I would recommend this over Fifty Shades of Grey. There is a better plot and more complex and likeable characters. Definitely worth reading, and hard to wait for the second and third books!

B0084IG8TM|5.0|I saw The Hunger Games on opening day, it was pretty adapted well from bestselling novel to a smash blockbuster hit that beated more than box office expectations that nobody included Lionsgate knew that this film has much longer legs that nearly ended up with over $405 million and over $681 million which is half a billion dollars on a budget of $78 million including marketing cost is only $45 million less than your usual blockbuster that cost $100 million film than even pleased men that the Twilight Saga films failed to do and a crowd-pleaser that this film is fun and violently well-made even the only major flaw is the shaky camera angles when it comes to the battle scenes that sometimes is necessary that way for the action being not too graphic for PG-13 that Academy Award best actress nominee for Winter's Bone and X-Men: First Class' Jennifer Lawrence gives another amazing performance this time as Katniss, she nails the character to perfection by going into the games as a tribute of district 12 that she taking the place of her sister is the anti-Bella Swan that she doesn't need a guy saving her butt when that she can use her bow, arrow, strength and surviorial skills to overcome a win in the hunger games. See this movie and you won't be disappointed!

B005LAIGTG|4.0|This movie, which is based on a true story, was better than I expected. It's a love story, so if you don't like that kind of film, you probably won't like this. But it's not a silly love story and it's nicely done. I've always liked Rachel McAdams, but this was the best performance of her career and makes the movie worth watching. The Blu Ray transfer is good, very good sound, nice picture with some good shots of Chicago. But make no mistake about it, this was McAdams' showcase movie and she seals the deal and carries the film. In the extras, co-star Channing Tatum said that he was \\"in awe\\" of her talent and that is well said.

1597772992|5.0|I strongly believe your dietary advice ,though it may not be easy for a social person like governors or presidents to follow. I wish to express in this media that my great grandmother lived for about 105yrs and was able to talk and remember our names whenever we visits her.

I took a chance and read the sample that was available. I was hooked.<br /><br />If it wasn't for the ability to at least get a taste of the story, I don't know if I would have ever had taken the chance on this book. I'm so very, very glad that I did.<br /><br />Thank you for a truly enjoyable story.
0140186409|5.0|As a student of History I had to read this book again. The old adage \\"There's nothing new under the sun\\" applies to the current economy and the main theme of this book. The careless disregard for fellow man in the quest for material wealth fueled by greed. This theme should be taught as a subject in American schools.

1118273052|5.0|Everyone seems to be looking for the magic key in an investing book. 'Do this and you'll make a fortune'.  The harsh truth is that practically every book ever written on the subject speaks in generalities:  (1) cut your losses  (2) invest in the company that is the leader in its industry (3) manage your money (4) Look for overbought (or oversold) situations (5) write covered calls or out of the money puts, etc etc etc.  The author provides just enough information to entice the reader, but not nearly enough to outperform the market (which is extremely difficult to do).  If you think you're going to become rich from a book that costs $9.95 in the business section in your bookstore, your knowledge of the real world needs some attention.  If you had a tried and true method for making serious money, would you really share that knowledge w/ the few thousand readers who would buy your book?<br /><br />That being said, this books has some interesting anecdotes and does lace in some general principles, but your own success will largely be determined from your experience and reasoning abilities.
B003WKFAIW|4.0|Although I think this is very good cd of M5 Hands All Over, beware that not all versions have 'Movers Like Jagger'. I browsed around I saw one CD had 13 traks, when I shoped around for best price and selected to buy, what I got was a CD with 12 traks (moves like jagger) was missing.  Not sure whats up with that but when doing some research, it seems thats the case more times than not. So, if you want (move like jagger), be sure to pay close attention thats what you're really getting. For now I will not purchase another on with 'missing' trak and just live with it..Overall view, this CD is much better than Overexposed (it was too disco like), this CD is true M5 sound, just wish I had 'move like jagger, tho.

B005HP2J66|5.0|For most people, the idea of caves trigger one of three reactions. For those who have problems with claustrophobia, the reaction is anxiety or downright fear. For those with a complete lack of imagination and wonder, the reaction is oh, who cares about that? For those of us with imagination, the reaction is curiousity, the yearning to see what's down there.<br /><br />My caving experience is rather limited; I've never been to any of the big ones. I have vague memories of visiting a tourist trap called the Lost Sea on the way to Florida as a child. Growing up near the Niagara Escarpment, I was used to the caves and crevices that criss cross that particular natural feature. Here in the Ottawa Valley, the Bonnechere Caves are within reach, and I've visited them. Still, I've always been curious about the big ones, about seeing the grandeur of great hidden places hidden away in the earth.<br /><br />The Chauvet Cave, first discovered in 1994, is a priceless treasure of human culture. Some thirty thousand years ago, the cave was being used by humans, who painted imagery on its walls. Almost exclusively animals, of course, with the odd exception, added on over millenia. Then the cave entrance was buried in a landslide, perhaps twenty five thousand years ago, and its secrets were lost to the outside world.<br /><br />The cave was sealed off by the French government after the discovery; they were eager to preserve the paintings. Humidity and sweat brought in by people tends to have an effect on such works, so a strict protocol was drawn up to ensure the paintings would remain safely in place. As such, very few people have the chance to see the images with their own eyes.<br /><br />At least, that is, until now. Filmmaker Werner Herzog was granted permission to film inside the caves, to document the place for posterity, and the result is the extraordinary Cave of Forgotten Dreams. The film made its debut at the Toronto International Film Festival, and has been lately circulating in general release, as a 3D release. I got a chance to see it, intrigued by the opportunity. Caves as part of movies are a bit of a hit and miss proposition; in terms of feature films, the horrific is usually given prominence over the grandeur, and so we get rephrensibly bad films such as Sanctum. In the case of documentaries, on the other hand, caves are an ideal subject, such as in the IMAX film Journey Into Amazing Caves.<br /><br />Herzog is the ideal director for this kind of project. He's something of an eccentric storyteller (in a good way). His feature films include Fitzcarraldo, Invincible, and Rescue Dawn, while he's also gone into documentary territory before, with Grizzly Man, the story of a mentally unhinged man who met his end at the claws of an Alaskan bear.<br /><br />Herzog and his crew were allowed time-limited access into the cave each day, filming the images and the interior of the cave in the 3D format. He's on the record as disliking 3D (unlike the current crop of studios who think it's the greatest thing ever), but in this case, he felt it appropriate. And I agree with him. I hate the format, but in this film, it works. I think Herzog's style helps immeasurably. He takes his time with the camera, slowly and carefully, and the paintings seem to take on a life of their own, emerging from the walls. It's not at all like a typical 3D film where the special effects are lunging out at you, making you nauseous or giving you a headache. In this case, the technology has the effect of drawing us into the cave.<br /><br />Herzog narrates the film, and appears as himself; he's a likeable, gruff presence, a man who's gifted with innate curiousity. His small crew and relatively minimal lighting having the unusual effect of creating a similar effect that the people who once lived here must have felt. The lighting almost feels like torchlight, so we're seeing the images in a very similar manner as they saw them.<br /><br />Throughout the cave, we feel their presence, these people who once lived here thousands of years in the past. It might be in the form of a footprint, or handprints still lingering on the walls. The art they left behind is striking and vivid, depictions of horses, bears, lions, rhinos, mammoths, and more. I found myself wondering about these people, long lost through the mists of time, feeling a connection to them that spanned the millennia.<br /><br />The film drew me completely in. It's an astonishing achievement, giving us a view of a place most of us will never be able to see with our own eyes, and making us feel like we're right there with Herzog and the crew. It gives us a glimpse into the past, into times before recorded history, and gives us a chance to connect with distant ancestors through what they left behind. It's a profound, strangely beautiful record of a mysterious place. If you have a chance to see this film in the theatres, do so.

B004LWZWGA|5.0|The Dark Knight returns one more time in the finale to director Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy, The Dark Knight Rises, and like the first two films in the set, the movie does not disappoint. It transcends the comic book adaptation, as more than an action thriller. It's a cerebral film, taking on big themes and psychological issues, and it succeeds in every way.<br /><br />It's been eight years since the events of the previous film, since Batman (Christian Bale) took the blame for the actions of the fallen District Attorney Harvey Dent (not to mention his death). Bruce Wayne has given up the mantle of the Bat and withdrawn into himself, worn down physically and emotionally. He spends much of his time holed up in his manor, while the city he once protected has rejected him. His company has seen better days, and is now steeply on a decline. All he has left for company is his butler and father figure Alfred (Michael Caine), who worries about how deeply Bruce has been battered by the events of the last few years.<br /><br />Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) knows the truth of his innocence, but is obliged to maintain the facade of Batman as an outlaw, and he has his own issues to deal with, from political concerns and senior officers jockeying for his post to an arrogant belief in the city that major crime is a problem of the past.<br /><br />Into the mix come two wild cards. Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway) is a cat burglar with an agenda all her own. And Bane (Tom Hardy) is a ruthless anarchist who unleashes hell on the city, in a series of attacks meant to draw out and destroy the Dark Knight, which is only the beginning of what he has in mind.<br /><br />The finale of the series is a harrowing journey into darkness. The film, scripted by Nolan, his brother Jonathan Nolan, and David S. Goyer, takes on themes that are very prevalent today: the conflict between rampant capitalism and rights of the people, the fear of terrorism, the role of justice in the world. It follows a hero who's just a man, at his lowest point, and asks the question of what can bring him back. There are influences from some of the biggest Batman stories of the comics: The Dark Knight Returns, Knightfall, and No Man's Land are obvious ones. There are also shades of the storming of the Bastille and the French Revolution underlying the story.<br /><br />The production values of the film are, as before, well worth it. The cinematography is spectacular; there are camera shots throughout the film that will leave you breathless. The special effects serve the story, and not the other way around; explosions for instance, in this film, are done properly, unlike the wildly over-exaggerated garbage we'd see out of a hack like Michael Bay (yes, Michael Bay, you are a hack of the first order. You are a hack in a hack class all of your own). And the score by Hans Zimmer (this time on his own, without his collaborator for the first two films, James Newton Howard) brings back some of the previous themes but goes off in other strong directions. Nolan has chosen his crew well, once again.<br /><br />The cast itself is splendid in their roles. Marion Cotillard is a newcomer as Miranda Tate, a tycoon with an energy device that may be the salvation of Wayne Enterprises. Cotillard is a gifted French actress who you might recall from Inception, another Nolan film. She plays the role with sublety and nuance, and fits very well into the tapestry of the film. Another Inception veteran is Joseph Gordon-Levitt, playing John Blake, an inherently decent Gotham Police officer. There is a curious quality to his nature, and a basic integrity to him. He becomes the audience point of view character, the everyman we can relate to, who steps up to do right just because it's the right thing.<br /><br />The returning veteran players inhabit their roles once more perfectly. Gary Oldman as Gordon is as good as ever; Oldman is one of the great character actors of our time, and as Batman's one time ally, we see a man who's deeply unhappy at having to publicly be against the Batman early on, and then finds himself confronting the worst possible crisis of his life. Morgan Freeman returns as Lucius Fox, the Wayne executive and father figure to Bruce who's provided much of the Bat tech in the past. There continues to be a wise strength in his portrayal of the character. And Michael Caine is very much the heart of the film, a foster father to Bruce Wayne, the guiding conscience, the Horatio to Bruce's Hamlet.<br /><br />Tom Hardy is another Inception veteran, and in that film, he completely stole the movie from the star, Leonardo DiCaprio (admittedly not that hard to do). He plays the monstrous Bane just as I'd expect him to be: a clever and brutal man, hidden behind a strange mask, a ferocious force of nature, and utterly nihilistic. Bane first appeared in the comics in the aforementioned Knightfall story, and has appeared in film, in the cinematic abomination that was Batman & Robin, where the character was a brainless idiot who happened to be nothing more than muscle for the two primary villains. For that and many other Bat-reasons, Joel Schumacher has more than earned his place in the seventh circle of Hell. This Bane is a decisive, bold leader, intelligent and sadistic, willing to do anything to achieve his objectives.<br /><br />Anne Hathaway plays Catwoman, though she's never once called that through the film. It's probably impossible to outdo Michelle Pfeiffer's take on the character, so Hathaway doesn't even try, instead playing the character closer to the comic book version, a woman who's straddling the line between hero and villain. She brings a strong energy to the role, and her character draws Bruce out of the darkness he has descended into. She's got the look of the character just right, and gives the character just the right dramatic touches in terms of personality.<br /><br />Christian Bale gives arguably his best performance of the trilogy in this film. His Batman has become brooding and withdrawn, consumed by losses in his life and the rejection of the people he once vowed to protect. The character is at the lowest ebb, and has to find his way out of despair and back to himself; he has to reinvest himself in his mission, to once again be the hero to a city that doesn't deserve him. Bale has an intensity and a drive as an actor that makes him fascinating to watch, and he inhabits the dual role of Bruce Wayne the tycoon and Batman the driven vigilante perfectly. In each of these films he's understood the basic truth: the real man is the one driven by his own tragedy to wage war on crime, to seek justice, and the facade or mask is the carefree socialite.<br /><br />Nolan has given us three outstanding, spectacular adaptations in this trilogy. The Dark Knight Rises is exhilarating, demanding, and rewarding, and not only is it a great comic adaptation and thrilling action film, it's also one of the best films of the year. It makes us care about the characters, surprises us in unexpected ways, and makes us ask ourselves questions.

B0013ND30M|1.0|All packaging says it's Sleeping Beauty, 50th Anniversary, Platinum Edition.  DVD says the same, but it's the Aladdin movie!  Needless to say, my daughter was very disappointed.  How can this happen?!  How nice the seller was to let me know I can return it, but I pay for the shipping.  Will NOT be using this seller again.
B0041KKYDI|5.0|A friend of my family from northern Ontario once saw a man stumble out of the woods onto his property, frantic and dishevelled, utterly terrified. He had been lost for merely an hour. Had he been lost for a night, he'd have probably been found dead. It's a hard fact of life: if you're lost and you panic, you're going to increase your odds of dying. If you stay calm, keep your head, and focus on the problem at hand, you've got a good chance of seeing home again.<br /><br />In 2003, climber Aron Ralston took a trip into the canyons of Utah. The ordeal he went through was widely reported at the time, and later Ralston wrote about it in the book Between A Rock And A Hard Place. Danny Boyle has given us the film 127 Hours, starring James Franco as Ralston.<br /><br />The first impression Franco gives us is of a man with an exuberance for life. Both in the book and in the film, Ralston comes across as an experienced outdoorsman. He loves getting out into the back country, exploring the wilderness. On this trip, however, he makes a couple of critical mistakes, which he deeply comes to rue. He goes off without telling anyone his plans, or when to expect him home. And when he comes across two women hiking in the canyon he visits, rather then leave with them, he chooses to explore further on his own.<br /><br />Most people go into this film already knowing what happened to Ralston. A misstep in the tight canyon sends him falling, and a boulder comes loose, pinning his hand. And so Ralston is trapped, with no one knowing where he is, and we the audience are trapped with him. Doyle places us right there, face to face with two fears: being trapped and dying alone.<br /><br />Ralston attempts to move the rock, first with his own strength and then with the equipment he has at hand, but has no success. He realizes how much trouble he's in. He has little food, little water, and he knows full well how long he might expect to live if no one comes across him. He understands that it might be days before anyone realizes he's even missing. In the days that follow, Ralston speaks to his family through the video camera he has on hand. He suffers. He hallucinates. He edges ever closer to death. And the audience can't help but feel a deep empathy for him.<br /><br />I was reminded watching the film of a similar story, documented in the book and film Touching The Void. Climber Joe Simpson, presumed dead on a mountain in South America, his leg badly broken, dragged himself off the mountain to base camp, despite the pain, despite the reality that he shouldn't have been able to do so. He and his friends tell their story while actors reenact the tale, and Simpson tells us that at the end, he was convinced that he was going to die, but he didn't want to die alone. He wanted to be with someone when he went. That need is repeated in Ralston's experience.<br /><br />Ralston is cut off from the world, and he knows he's going to die, alone. Finally, in a moment of clarity, he realizes what he has to do to escape, and as unthinkable as it is, he does so without reservation. The amputation scene is graphic. Don't go into this film with a full stomach. Still, it's an essential scene. Ralston takes his fate into his hands, driven by the primal need we all have to survive.<br /><br />The film is outstanding. Doyle, a strong director with a varied group of films to his credit, brings us right into the situation. Another director might find the notion of a camera being confined in a small space for so long to be a daunting process, but Doyle rises to the challenge and succeeds. He's given us a film that makes us think, raises some tough questions, and ultimately uplifts the audience.<br /><br />And the Oscar should have just been given to James Franco straight off. His performance is that good. Franco is one of those actors who seems incapable of giving a bad performance, and he's in fine form with this role. We feel deeply for our protagonist as his ordeal progresses. Franco proves adept at conveying an expression that haunts us during the ordeal. His hallucinations and one way speeches to his family during the ordeal are heartbreaking. And he captures the essence of Ralston's resourcefulness, fortitude, and courage perfectly.<br /><br />This was, in short, the best film of the year.ranco proves adept at conveying an expression that haunts us during the ordeal.

B006RUJST6|5.0|I read the great reviews of this book and wasn't sure what to expect. I am absolutely THRILLED I bought this book - I read it in one day because I could not put it down. This story is different, honest, emotional, romantic, passionate, etc. The characters of Lake and Will are wonderful and they have a great dynamic. Also, bringing the poetry slam element into the book created something completely different that I had never read before in a book. Mixing poetry into Lake and Will's lives was a really special touch...and the end of the book - Ah!! As soon as I finished Slammed, I immediately bought the second book, Point of Retreat, and read that in one day. If you are looking for something that is fresh, emotional, romantic, and will make you laugh, cry, and smile - please take a chance on this book, you will not regret it!
B006RUJST6|4.0|There is a lot going on in this book. It's not a quick read but it flows well and keeps you intrigued. The story line took several twists and turns that I didn't see coming. Definitely an emotional read and I loved with how the author dealt with the tragedy.

B007IHH4I4|5.0|I owned this album in the 70's and wore it out (not as clothing) by the 1990's and since then have bought the remastered CD version to replace my old album. The CD version is OK but somehow wasn't giving me the same thrill as the original vinyl did and left me a little flat or distanced from the recording if that makes any sense. Anyway, I decided to see if this reissued vinyl version could bring the feel of the original and lo and behold it does the trick. The main difference is the drum sound. This is most notable on the seemingly straight rock tracks I'm So Free, Wagon Wheel, and Hangin' Round. Anyone who has spent an intoxicated evening following the Bowie produced studio and stereo trickery and the magnificent bass and drum interplay in these songs will be glad to hear it all back again. I suppose in a way it's the story of vinyl versus digital and those of us that still have vinyl memories of music are often left wondering why we even liked some things in the first place when we hear the CD version. So if you want to hear this in all it's full dynamic glory BUY THE VINYL LP the CD is not bad but not as good. The songs and production on Transformer are up with the best in the Reed canon and this is my favourite RCA album by Lou Reed. I know this because I still have old original working vinyl versions of all the other RCA albums in my collection and none of those have worn out yet. A great album faithfully reproduced.

B005FITIDC|5.0|So tonight I watched a film that I had been really wanting to watch, but yet at the same time I was putting off seeing.<br /><br />Now I know that is an oxymoron but it is truth.  And it is a great depiction of this film as well.<br /><br />The movie was \\"Machine Gun Preacher\\" the story of Sam Childres.<br /><br />You can read multiple different reviews on this film.  It was very controversial since it was a story of FAITH but rated R and filled with violence.<br /><br />In the first 10 min's the film would turn any Christian watching it for Christian Values (Or at least make them blush).  From the on screen, yet not visible, sex in a car to extreme profanity, violence and alcohol and Drug abuse scenes... yet all these items are in context and are used to build the Character of the man.<br /><br />This man who was a biker gang member who upon getting out of jail finds his wife had gone `religious'.  Yet in a turn of events he realizes there has to be something more and in a non-dramatic scene we find him believing and being baptized.  There weren't angels, there weren't shouts from him but a sort of groggy sense of awe.<br /><br />We again see that same feeling when he arrives back from a trip to Northern Uganda to help with construction of a mission.  He, unlike the other members, wanted to see the truth of the war.  And did he ever...  His soon to be friend Deng took him to a village where the children would come each night in order to not be abducted.<br /><br />Finally he senses God's call to build an orphanage and a Church.  One in American and one in Sudan.  This is the story of the trials and floods that he goes against.  You will be pulled into the reality of this war that has been waged for 30+ years and that has taken the lives of over 400,000 people.  You will feel his anguish, his hurt, and his anger.<br /><br />There were two parts of this movie that moved me the most outside of the general message of Orphan care that you all know is my passion.<br /><br />First: When he is arriving back in the states after his monumental first trip.  You see on his face the unspoken emotion of one whose world has just been changed.  I have been there.  From my first visit to a squatters village in Mexico, or a small tribal village in Guatemala; but most vividly in the post earthquake Haiti where orphans begged for water on every street corner; where bodies are still being found among the ruble...  I understood this vague look of heartache.<br /><br />Second: we watch as Sam's story progress' and eventually we see what happens to most of us who become passionate about something.  We come up against opposition and we want to quit.  Sam didn't; but once he kept going he began to see others who didn't understand his passion, or share his passion as unworthy of being called Christians.  His passion became the only true passion of Christ instead of one means of showing God's passion.<br /><br />I would HIGHLY recommend this film to all of you who wish to learn more about what one man is doing in Sudan/Uganda.  I do not recommend it for those who are easily offended.  This Machine Gun Preacher lives up to his name not only with his gun but with his mouth.<br /><br />There is a quick note from the Real Sam at the end of the film in the credits that says in essence that I know that I may not have gone about this the best or right way at times... but  \\"If a madmen abducted your child or a family member and I said I could bring them home, does it matter how I bring them home?\\"<br /><br />So to sum it all up: Don't watch it with the kids.  But don't watch it if you don't want your heart pulled out, trampled on cause you will finish asking yourself (I Hope) What on earth am I doing!!<br /><br />This movie is not about Sam Childers. It's about you. What are you going to do?r />First: When he is arriving back in the states after his monumental first trip.

B00280LYIC|5.0|I absolutely love this book...I had seen the movie first, usually I read the book first, and loved the movie and thought why not see what the books are like..I was pleasantly surprised how even though of course there were differences both were in their own way fantastic.  The book seemed more magical and like you were on an adventure. I couldn't put it down and was eager to move on in the series.  It's always great when you can find a book that takes you from your world and puts you in theirs...this book is great and I would recommend to anyone from young children to adults..Rick Riordan is one of the best authors I have read in awhile and I hope he sticks around for some time to come.

0345803485|1.0|Ana is so immature it is annoying. She is the main character, and reading her internal mental dialogue is taxing. From the struggles she faces from indecision over her relationship with Christian, to the immature fauning, the writing comes across as something a high schooler would write.<br /><br />How did this ever make it to the best seller list? I have no idea. There is plenty of cheap fictional erotica out there and its better than this. I guess I am confused.
B000QUCNOK|3.0|The film, \\"Perfume\\", directed and cowriten by German director, Tom Tykwer, is based on a novel I read shortly after it was published in 1985. I recall then thinking that is was an odd story, which seemed to have few cinematic virtues. This movie tends to confirm my point.<br /><br />The first thing which strikes me is that the dialogue is thin as a weak broth, made from old bones. I find myself in disagreement with several professional critics when I say that the most enjoyable scenes in the film are those with Dustin Hoffman as the old Parisian perfumer, Baldini. Those scenes have at least some reasonable amount of exposition by a character rather than the clinical voice of John Hurt who does the narration, an unseen voice. Some critics complained about Hoffman's over the top acting, a bit too \\"kitch\\". Well, maybe it was, but it seemed to be one of the few traces of real life, however \\"overdone.\\"<br /><br />My strongest memory from the novel was the discovery that the main character, the infant who was to be given the name Jean-Baptiste Grenouille, played by relatively unknown actor Ben Whishaw, had no smell whatsoever. This comes very early in the novel, setting the scene for what is to motivate the principle character throughout the story. This revelation does not come out in the film until about 2/5 of the way through it, leaving us with no strong explanation for why Grenouille is so entranced by the smell of the young apricot seller (the Wikipedia plot summary says plums. They look far more like apricots to me.)<br /><br />The unique absence of all sent from the child is replaced in the film by its beginning with a scene where Grenouille is sentenced to a horrible execution. Most of the remainder of the film is a flashback about his life leading up to that scene, which plays out in a manner which should confirm (if nothing up to that point does not drive home this point) that the story is a fantasy. But it's a fantasy based on a very slim extrapolation of reality. What if a human had as acute a smell as a dog, for example. This is played out when Grenouille demonstrates for himself that his extract of the fragrance of his first victim is recognized by that victim's dog. We are reminded of this evidence later in the film.<br /><br />For those who are annoyed by spoilers in reviews, you may wish to stop now.<br /><br />I found several scenes in the film which were simply too unrealistic to accept, similar to a Sci Fi movie about people in outer space where they can hear sounds in the vacuum of space or they walk as if there were gravity where there can't be any. The most jarring was in the execution scene, where, having been stripped to the waist and chained to the wall of a locked cell, Grenouille manages to retain possession of not only his vial of perfume made from the 13 essences of the fragrance of his 13 victims, but he retains a handkerchief by which he can disperse the fragrance to the crowd assembled to view his execution. Perhaps the whole unreality of the scene is signaled when Grenouille arrives at the execution stage dressed like a dandy, in a carriage fit for royalty, instead of the hay cart we are so familiar with from the French Revolution.<br /><br />Less \\"unreal\\", but similarly jarring was the scene in Baldini's laboratory where Grenouille creates an improvement over a perfume Baldini was trying to copy. It was reasonable to believe that Grenouille's talent enabled him to identify the five or six components of this perfume, but as he himself states, he knows the smells, but he does not know the names or how to capture them. So how does Grenouille assemble the components he needs by selecting sealed containers, with labels. The business as Grenouille enters Baldini's laboratory suggests he can distinguish each of the smells from the hundreds of containers by smell alone. I suspect that would be beyond the capabilities of even a bloodhound.<br /><br />Bottom line is that the film is about the sense of smell,which may be virtually impossible to convey in a film. But wait, wasn't there a very successful film entitled \\"The Scent of a Woman\\" which seemed to succeed in conveying that idea. The very slow pace of this film, with precious little dialogue to speak of, tends to be just a bit boring. Which is odd, because my memory of the novel was that it was anything but boring. Here, Hoffman, pulls off a good scene or two, and Alan Rickman is almost totally wasted, with very little dialogue. If the roles of Narrator and  Antoine Richis, the 13th victim's father, were reversed, at least we would have been treated to Rickman's delightfully serious sounding voice. Hurt's voice seemed to lack character, the same way the principle character lacked a fragrance.<br /><br />The proper bookends of the film perhaps should have been Grenouille's triumph in finding a proper fragrance to replace his own lack of one.which may be virtually impossible to convey in a film. But wait, wasn't there a very successful film entitled \\"The Scent of a Woman\\" which seemed to succeed in conveying that idea. The very slow pace of this film, with precious little dialogue to speak of, tends to be just a bit boring. Which is odd, because my memory of the novel was that it was anything but boring. Here, Hoffman, pulls off a good scene or two, and Alan Rickman is almost totally wasted, with very little dialogue. If the roles of Narrator and  Antoine Richis, the 13th victim's father, were reversed, at least we would have been treated to Rickman's delightfully serious sounding voice. Hurt's voice seemed to lack character, the same way the principle character lacked a fragrance.<br /><br />The proper bookends of the film perhaps should have been Grenouille's triumph in finding a proper fragrance to replace his own lack of one.

B000Q9IR0A|5.0|Great book! I'm in a leadership program and this was a required reading. Great book on execution. Must read for anyone trying to improve their execution and wanting to learno additional styles.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I have to admit, I initially bought the book in March and just didn't get it--all the fuss. So, I stopped reading. I only finished recently when I was stuck on an airplane realizing I had nothing new on my Kindle. The novel is not good literature. Perhaps, if one is an adolescent girl that longs for a 27 year old billionaire who is into dominating virgins--then yes--that person would enjoy this book.<br /><br />For anyone who is an avid reader and been in and out of relationships, there is nothing realistic about this book. I haven't really met any hot girls who are twenty- two, out of college, who have only kissed a boy and not explored any further (themselves or men). Further, in this day and age, how does a college graduate look for work without a cell phone, email, or computer? Good literature allows the reader suspend disbelief--without the reader's awareness. The entire time, I just didn't believe the characters, their circumstance, or the dialogue.<br /><br />I could go on, but the other reviews are spot on...and more enjoyable than this book. I can only guess that all the fuss is because there are a lot of folks out there afraid to move beyond \\"vanilla.\\" Maybe this book gives women courage to do that--but I have to believe a good bottle of red would do the same, in less time, and be more enjoyable.
B008BM9L72|2.0|Bought the trilogy thinking this was the next \\"big\\" thing - I didn't hate this book but I wouldn't say it was memorable. I honestly couldn't like Ana and I found Christian more interesting as a character but still way under developed. This book was ok and if you are reading for just sex scenes and fluff fair enough but if you like a bit of quality plot and character development - look elsewhere.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I absolutly LOVE these headphones. I am not a fan at all of ear buds, I can never get them to stay in my ears while running. These are lightweight and fit really nice on your head. I actually got 4 pairs of them just incase they stop selling them!! I would recommend them to anyone that likes the headband headphone!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like the games when your waiting but the ads were annoying.  Some games were hard to control because controls were sticky and slow.
B001IHJ97E|3.0|I consider Douglas Trumball's Brainstorm to be a deeply flawed masterpiece. The film's intriguing premise involves the development of a kind of \\"mental cam-corder\\" which allows you to store another person's experiences for later playback. However, when a researcher dies while wearing the recording unit, it opens the possibility of vicariously undergoing death itself.<br /><br />Christopher Walken and Louise Fletcher play Michael Brace and Lillian Reynolds the driven scientists who create the device. Cliff Robertson prowls around the edges of the story as their oily corporate boss. Natalie Wood, in her final role, is cast as Brace's estranged wife.<br /><br />The first two thirds of the movie are shot in a serious, cool, abstract style which reminded me of Stanley Kubrick or some of David Cronenberg's work. The visuals are appealing and even, on occasion, mesmerizing. The dialogue is spare, fast paced and oblique. There isn't a lot of direct exposition and the effect is a kind of documentary style realism that pulls you into the story. Wood, and Fletcher turn in solid performances and the quirky, deadpan Walken is an actor who is always interesting to watch.<br /><br />If the director had been able to maintain the tone that he set in first section, this might have been a great movie. Unfortunately the last third of the film falls apart completely. There are numerous continuity issues with this section of the film and things that just plain don't make any sense. For instance the Brace's young son is injured, but then this plot point is simply abandoned.<br /><br />However, for me the worst part of this meltdown is that toward the end the film degenerates into a grade B slapstick farce, pulling every bad sight-gag in the book - bumbling security guards, people slipping on ball-bearings and being covered with oodles of foam and so forth. Unfortunately, these zany pie-in-the-face antics are intercut with material about the afterlife in such a way that it's hard to take any of it seriously. It's as if the final section of 2001 had been mixed with scenes from a bad Disney comedy.<br /><br />It is hard to know how much of this deterioration is the result of Natalie Wood's death toward the end of the production. But whatever the reason, the last portion of the film is a jarring uneven mishmash of discordant elements that is ultimately very unsatisfying. This was particularly disappointing to me since I found the first part of the film so enjoyable.<br /><br />I give this movie three stars.
B005898DDO|4.0|So...what is a 60-something, conservative Christian doing writing a review on a Bob Dylan documentary?  I confess, I have liked Dylan since I was in high school.  I became a fan when \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" was on the radio.  Became a bigger fan when I found that Peter, Paul and Mary had been doing his earlier stuff, and even bigger when the Byrds covered him.  I always bought the popular notion that he was a political commentator...a rebel with a cause.  This DVD dispells that notion, and I love it!<br /><br />Dylan is too cool.  He did musically what he wanted and was unconcerned that the folk lefties were so dimayed.  I thought Peter Yarrow was going to cry when it looked that Dylan wasn't going to do the acoustic stuff at Monteray.  Some of the other folk socialists took his apparent heresy in stride, but Joan Baez was simply broken-hearted that Bobby wasn't fronting the social movement of the early sixties.  Wah!<br /><br />This documentary was just so much fun (nostalgic as well.)  I was left hoping for Part Two (maybe titled \\"Blood on the Tracks\\"?)  I would love to know what was really going on behind the scene through the eighties and nineties.<br /><br />Oh well.  \\"No Direction Home\\" was just great, and it'll have to do for now.

1468161660|5.0|After reading several people's reviews about Slammed I purchased the book immediately. I can't tell you how happy I am that I did. This is a wonderful story, love, tears, heartache, and fantastic writting. I love how Colleen writes. She captivates you immediately. This book in my opinion is a 5 star. Read it, then read the sequel. I did, the second I finished the last page of Slammed. I read Point of Retreat in one day.. I couldn't put that book down either.<br /><br />I can't wait for the third sequel!!

B001EPYQO6|5.0|I watched the two movies side by side with my duel set up screen and paused the original whenever it deviated from the directors cut. All in all the cut was muuuuuch better than the original, the only itty bitty downside is they changed the score during hector and Achilles fight and the original score was better than the random battle music the cut has for the same fight. On that note though the fight is much more well done and brad shines through as a better actor in the directors cut while he seems sorta stale/cool but that's it in the original.
B007Y1S2HQ|4.0|I loved, loved, loved Rumer's debut album and eagerly anticipated this release.  Personally, I think an artist has to \\"earn\\" the right to release an album of covers.  That bias aside, I truly think Rumer's unique voice is better suited to original material.  This is a fairly unusual selection of tracks to cover, mostly songs that haven't been covered a zillion times before.  But honestly this cd sounds distressingly similar to something you'd hear on an infomercial for K-Tel's \\"'70s AM GOLD.\\"<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, it's a totally listenable cd.  But I also don't think it lives up to the promise of her first release!
1451629192|5.0|I was moved by this book. Yes, to all of those claiming it to have been too graphic, it kind of was. But that was what she went through, and she is giving an honest and blunt portrayal of her experience. She is an extremely inspiring person. She is not hateful and resentful. She simply accepted what happened to her, and moved on from it. It's easy to see that Joycee is a beautiful woman, inside and out. She went through hell, and came out strong and courageous. I'm glad I read the book.

B000Q6GUW0|1.0|I ordered a tv season and was sent the wrong one. I first had to pay $5 in shipping to send the wrong one back, and was only refunded $2.50. The whole process took over a month, and I sent the DVD back 2 weeks ago and though they said the money for the DVD was refunded to my credit card, it still has not gone through. Very unprofessional business and I would never order from them again.

B007K3JFUQ|1.0|I will be honest, I only watched the first 20 minutes.  It became clear that this was going to be nothing but over-choreagraphed fight scenes, one on top of the other.  It was completely lacking in dialogue or story--these are the key ingredients to any Guy Ritchie film, so I was doubly disappointed in that vein.  Maybe I liked the first one too much, or maybe I like Sherlock (BBC) too much, because I could not stomach that much of this.  I am selling it back largely unseen.  Don't waste your time and ruin the experience (think Dead Like Me movie).  Wait till it comes out on pay TV and ignore it then.

0142410349|4.0|I read this to my daughter Magda (who's two-and-a-half) and asked her some questions about it.

Ro--<br />  Roald Dahl!<br />That's right. What happened in the book?<br />  The chickens were scared.<br />That's true. Why were they scared?<br />  Because they would be killed and they were killed.<br />Who killed the chickens?<br />  The Fantastic Mr. Fox!<br />That's true. It wasn't a happy ending for the chickens.<br />  Yeah.<br />Who were the farmers in the book?<br />  Uh...<br />Boggis...<br />  Bunce and Bean!<br />And did Boggis, Bunce and Bean like Mr. Fox?<br />  No, they didn't.<br />Why not?<br />  They were scared.<br />What were they scared of?<br />  Mr. Fox is hiding and he will eat their chickens.<br />That's true. They were scared Mr. Fox would steal their chickens and they were right.<br />  (looking through the pictures) Look, Mr. Fox is not happy. He is frustrated for his family.<br />That's true. Was his family hungry?<br />  Yeah and they was hiding.<br />Why couldn't they just go out and get food?<br />  (thinking) Because Bean would get them!<br />So how did Mr. Fox get food?<br />  He went and he met all the funny animals.<br />What kind of animals did he meet?<br />  Goose, apple cider...<br />(laughing) Well, yes. Did he also meet a badger?<br />  He did.<br />And did they find food?<br />  Yeah and they dropped it all over the place.<br />What happened at the end?<br />  They all clinked glasses.<br />Like cheers?<br />  Yeah, they all did cheers!<br /><br />For more reviews, please visit my blog, CozyLittleBookJournal.
B005V20JKI|3.0|This game is a pretty good platform adventure title very similar to Mario Bros in terms of gameplay.  The graphics are great, there are a lot of good ideas, and the variation of hero types keep the game interesting but it lacks some necessary polish to make it a true winner.<br /><br />Problems:<br /><br />- The heroes aren't balanced at all.  As an example, the primary character -- the Knight -- is utterly useless until fully upgraded, at which point you're merely able to \\"survive\\"<br />- The Bull.  Get rid of it.  It's the worst penalty out there.  Not one time has it helped me... it only serves to destroy positional strategy and/or run into walls/pits.<br />- Jump/Fire button responsiveness.  There's just too much buggy performance here.  Platform games are all about timing and reflexes and I've died too many times because the controls don't respond.<br />- Muffin Drops.  You seriously need to move muffin drops out from underneath monster drops.  It's just stupid.  No matter your approach, you're always subject to the possibility that a burning goblin falls on your head with absolutely no warning whatsoever.  It's no fun playing a game with \\"auto death\\".<br />- Performance.  I know this is largely attributable to hardware but I've got a LG G2X (Tegra 2/dual-core) and I still notice stuttering.  My phone can play games like Nova with no problems at all.  Clean it up.<br /><br />Once those issues are resolved, this could easily be a 5-star game.  Until then though, $1 is about all it's worth.
0446585025|4.0|I'm not a huge fan of audiobooks, but I got this one as a present. I would have preferred the actual book, but whaddya gonna do? Anyway, it's pretty good and it's always fun to hear Ellen talk, but I think I'd still rather read the book. Especially since she mentions on the audiobook that there are several chapters that only make sense when seen on the page. Grrr!<br /><br />UPDATE: The book is great, just like the audiobook. One of the chapters that is for \\"readers only\\" is a translation of teen text speak. It's cute. I like that she compensated by having a \\"listeners only\\" chapter of random funny sounds.<br /><br />For more reviews, please visit my blog, CozyLittleBookJournal.
0307959856|1.0|Like many other reviewers of this book, I read some of the pro reviews and was looking forward to reading this historical mystery. Like many others, was dreadfully disappointed not only in the style but in the mystery itself. I think this book suffers from the celebrity author syndrome. No one wants to tell a celebrity author to cut 100 pages or to edit out an unnecessary character description.<br /><br />Was it an inside joke that she sent the Wickhams to Williamsburg or was it just a mistake? Williamsburg in 1803 was a forgotten town of less than 600 and no longer the capitol of Virginia.
0062119044|5.0|Eva never really wanted to be a mother; certainly not of the boy who murdered seven of his fellow high school students, a cafeteria worker and a teacher who tried to befriend him. (book jacket)<br /><br />In this haunting novel--a descriptor that is overused but in this case apt--Lionel Shriver tries to answer the question: Why'd he do it? What happened? We read about these kids on the news, the ones who take weapons to school and go on a rampage in the cafeteria. What happened? Were they abused? Were they bullied? Were they crazy? More often than not the newspapers give us few answers. In We Need to Talk About Kevin, Eva Khatchadourian tries to make sense of her own son's rampage. Why did he do it? Where did it all go wrong?<br /><br />But Lionel Shriver is asking another question in her novel. What happens if you don't love your child? The character of Eva is ambivalent about having children, ambivalent about pregnancy and painfully ambivalent about her own child when he arrives. She, in her words, feels nothing. It's easy to say that this is common, that it is postpartum depression, and that the attachment will come with time. But what if it doesn't? Eva is so disappointed in her own disappointed at motherhood that she keeps her child at arm's length and never forms the bond she assumed would come naturally. Is this why he became a killer? Or was she naturally distant from him because he was born a monster?<br /><br />The novel offers no definite answers and, since it is comprised entirely of letters written by Eva to her husband Franklin, we have only Eva's word for how things really happened. In a way it only tells half the story, but when it comes to trying to understand a killer, half the story is all we ever have.<br /><br />For more reviews, please visit my blog, CozyLittleBookJournal.
B008K8U13K|2.0|I'm playing this on a Kindle Fire; why are the controls so positively awful? The d-pad is far too small! Save your money and buy this game on a real console.

B002MQYOFW|1.0|Well written, compelling trilogy , but not fit for young minds in my opinion.  Even when one won the hunger games, it was a loss.  Also, killing for viewer's entertainment left me very discouraged about that society (I hope not our current society).  I read the books because my teen aged grandchildren were reading them and I objected to their reading them. Then it occurred to me that if I was going to object to a book, I should have at least read it.  I must admit that the books were compelling enough that when I had read The Hunger Games, I certainly wanted to read the rest so I could see how it turned out.  In a word, disturbing!
0143119680|1.0|This book had so much potential that I kept reading, expecting something exciting to happen.  It never did.  I am a big fan of well-written fantasy novels, but this was totally disappointing.  The entire book seemed to be building up to a major confrontation.  I kept waiting to see the power struggle between the witches, deamons, and vampires.  The promise of a big display of witchcraft and magic was like dangling the proverbial carrot in front of the mule.  The main character is super-witch, but she never quite manages to get control of her powers and never uses them convincingly.  The powerful vampire hero is easily beaten into submission by a girl vampire who is even more powerful.  The guy almost dies, for Pete's sake.  So much for him.  What a wimp!  You keep waiting, but nothing happens.  In the end, they disappear into the past and it all fizzles.  If this is a trilogy, I won't waste my time with the next two parts.
0812993292|5.0|Rachel Joyce's THE UNLIKELY PILGRIMAGE OF HAROLD FRY took me completely by surprise. It's a quiet novel, at times slow-going, but the pace seems to mimic Harold's progress. I was in Harold's corner from the beginning, championing this unusual hero, and I wanted nothing more than for him to overcome every obstacle and find his friend at last. Though it often seemed impossible, I couldn't help but believe in Harold's strange quest.<br /><br />The evolution of Maureen and Harold's relationship amazed me most. After forty years of marriage, the pair seem to have stopped seeing one another. They drift past like ghosts, like roommates, and Maureen seems as icy-cold as they come. As the details of their shared past emerge, it's obvious why the silence and tension have sustained them for so long -- and my heart broke for both, standing so close together but so far apart. While I initially disliked Maureen and wanted to scold her for not believing in her husband's journey, I couldn't fault her for the pain they'd both endured. The pieces eventually came together.<br /><br />Harold, the unlikely pilgrim, is such a bold and sympathetic character -- a man of integrity who has survived so much. Beneath his placid exterior beats the heart of a man with much left to experience. Despite feeling old, washed-up and broken, Harold realizes he's been lying in wait to do something for far too long. His walk opens him up to other people -- their faults, their dreams. He looks outward instead of inward, realizing the capacity friendship and compassion have to fill up our lives. I was cheering for Harold from the start.<br /><br />Author Helen Simonson (Major Pettigrew's Last Stand) blurbs Harold Fry, and I could detect similarities between her work and Joyce's. Not so much in subject, but in feeling -- this idea that age is just a number. Both Joyce and Simonson are British authors with older men as their subjects, and both have plenty yet to experience -- and impart. I loved that Harold's journey reminded me of the best part of Major Pettigrew's story, and I think fans of Simonson's popular novel will find an ally in Harold.<br /><br />By the novel's close, the text was blurring beneath an ocean of tears -- ones I didn't really expect, ones that stopped me completely. Harold isn't a character you can soon forget -- and his journey of loyalty, redemption, friendship and love will stay with me for a long time.s journey reminded me of the best part of Major Pettigrew's story, and I think fans of Simonson's popular novel will find an ally in Harold.<br /><br />By the novel's close, the text was blurring beneath an ocean of tears -- ones I didn't really expect, ones that stopped me completely.

B000YI7MRM|3.0|Based on a series of novels from prolific author Arturo Perez-Reverte, this film is a swashbuckler about the adventures of Spanish soldier Diego Alatriste and his ward during the dying days of the Spanish Empire.  The very idea of a Spanish swashbuckler is refreshing - generally Spaniards are seen eagerly impaling themselves on Errol Flynn's flailing foils.<br /><br />In an equally interesting casting coup, Viggo Mortensen (who has a B.A. in Spanish) stars as the tough swordsman.  Mortensen's words are few, his Spanish rather mushy.  Though the production values in this film are excellent, one major distraction is Alatriste's hat.  It might be accurate for the period, but the enormous piece of millinary makes Mortensen look like a giant mushroom.<br /><br />One big problem for English-speaking viewers of Perez-Reverte film adaptations is deciphering Spain's political history.  Alatriste is no exception.  If it compells the viewer to review a little Spanish history, great; I suspect that it will leave quite a few scratching their heads however.<br /><br />The film's greatest weakness - alluded to in other reviews - is that this film tries to cram pieces of the series of novels into one film.  Consequently, the film feels choppy and disjointed.<br /><br />There is a femme fatale in the film, which I suspect Perez-Reverte wrote as an homage to Milady De Winter of Dumas' The Three Musketeers, but... casting is vital, and this is another weak point.  The child who portrays that character has strong presence and mature flintiness, but her adult counterpart is weak.<br /><br />Despite all of these flaws, Alatriste is an unusual cinematic experience.  If you like swashbucklers, it is well worth your time.

B005IQZB14|5.0|Aiiiiiiiiiiii...shall never complain about aching feet on the trail again !  Being a nature-loving hiker as well as having a high interest in human relationships, this was right up my alley.  Couldn't have enjoyed it more.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Love it!!  What a fun game.  I love the graphics.  I cannot stop playing... Very colorful and interesting.  I can't wait to level up to see what is next.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Just bought this app and have enjoyed so far. Nice tiles and appreciate the automatic shuffle when you run out of moves.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Bought this to cool down my old Pentium 4. I almost cooked my CPU with a standard Intel type fan.<br /><br />It work greats. My CPU stays mostly around 45 degrees C, used be in the 60's<br /><br />Be sure and make sure it will fit in your cabinet. Its not to bad to install, just read the instructions,<br /><br />and I really like the screws you use to attach it, they are so much better then those plastic clips used on other CPU fans.<br /><br />Its a bit noisy but I don't mind, its lot better then cooking your CPU.
0345803485|1.0|This book is for teenagers who never had sex before. No one else could find this kind of book appealing. The problem is that those teenagers then will imagine that this is the reality.  It is not even close to the reality. It is far stretched, repetitive, boring after the first sex scene. Later on it does not develop any plot.  The characters are not developed either.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong.  I do like romantic novels and I do like sex in books.  But this one... it is a fantasy land which makes you want to laugh hysterically instead of get into it.  I always finished all books that I have ever read but I don't think that I can finish this one.<br /><br />There is nothing to be said about this book that has not been said before.  I am glad that I did not buy it but just borrowed from a friend. Don't waste your money. I don't know what strings the author pulled to get this become a bestseller.
B008MEM24S|5.0|really enjoy playing this. it's great when you're looking to waste some time or just find something to get your mind off things for a bit.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|some puzzles are super easy, but every so often one pops up i can't figure out. great for a free app.
0345803485|3.0|I purchased all three for my kindle and just finished the first of the books.  It seems to me that this author took a little from Twilight a little from Pretty woman and a few more novels/movies and mixed them all together and wrote a book.  If she can write a book, anyone can.  The main characters, as far as I know, aren't British but speak as though they are.  It's really not good writing.  I'm not sure what the hype is about but I hope the other two are better than this one.
0345803485|1.0|I just downloaded this book on my IPAD.  I've have been steadily reading for a few hours now, hoping, against hope, that it would get at least a little better on the next page; no such luck.  This book is nothing but horrible.  I doubt I'll be able to finish it.  It sounds as though it was written by a young person, instead of an adult, but then you have to consider that this \\"supposed\\" young person seems to know a LOT about sex.<br /><br />Also, the writing is terrible.  I don't profess to be a writer, but I've been a reader for over 65 years and know good writing when I read it.  I do believe I could do a lot better.<br /><br />I bought this book because everyone I know was raving about it, especially those in the 20ish age range.  I wish I had saved my $10.00.  Oh well, you live and learn.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this Bible app. There are so many great devotionals to choose from. Thank you for making it free.

034580404X|3.0|The book is enjoyable. A must read! But I am just nearing the end of the first book and noticed that I am missing 10 sequential pages. Not happy with this at all!
B00846TTDG|5.0|This video was amazing and definitely increased the respect I have for Navy Seals. The video can be a bit bloody at parts, and while nobody is shown being tortured it does show a clip of a lady that has been tortured and graphically shows how she was tortured, and the video lets you listen to the rest, but that is to be expected from a Navy Seal movie about enemy terrorists.
B000H6SXMY|4.0|Disks are in proper order, but only broken into 6 sections, instead of by season.  Each section is in a folder with one of the character's faces on it.  So, if looking for a certain season, have to flip through a bit, but not a problem.  I like the compact nature of the organization.
B002GHIPYI|5.0|I think these are great. Other than the ear material they are very comfortable. Girlfriend actually stole them from me. Well manufactured and cool style
B007EC27QM|5.0|works fine for my needs.  do bowling league sheets every week.  my kindle fire is always with me which makes it handy and readily available.
0671027344|5.0|Amazing read. Very easy and flows. After reading for a while I feel as if I am who Charlie is writing to.<br />To me, that's not something any author can just do. I love, love this book. In my top five for sure. Highly recommend for anyone who enjoys teen and high school themed books!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I have fun playing this game every day and look foreword to new stuff and I enjoy completing all the goals.
0345803485|1.0|The problem with this thing isn't that it's porn.<br /><br />The problem with this thing is that it's BAD porn. It fails to be sexy, it fails to be convincing, and the storyline is so eye-rollingly silly that it stands out as unbelievable even to Twilight fans.<br /><br />The reason people go on about it is because it's supposed to be SOO kinky. Meh. It's kinky, but it is kinky in an almost pedestrian manner. E L James clearly did a LITTLE research, so all the BDSM elements mentioned exist, but the way in which they (and even the the vanilla sex) are treated is clearly fantastical, often hilariously so. Anyone shocked by THIS book needs to get out more.<br /><br />If the rumours about this book interest you, and you're looking for hot fiction about it, you should instead check out [[ASIN:0700400001 Story of O]] (or the graphic version; [[ASIN:B000B8949Y The Illustrated Story Of O]]), [[ASIN:0061233498 Exit to Eden]], [[ASIN:1563332280 Carrie's Story]], [[ASIN:1573443840 Fast Girls: Erotica for Women]], or [[ASIN:1573443794 Best of Best Women's Erotica 2]].

B0017O1MIM|5.0|I saw this in 70mm when I was a boy and it has stuck with me. I had it on VHS and I will get it on this DVD when available.<br /><br />When I went to work in Saudi in 1997 I was sitting with an Oxford educated Saudi Prince dressed in his finery almost straight out of the movie. In his perfect English accent he told me that his people could no longer survive in the desert like the Bedouin. He asked me if I had prepared in any way for coming to Saudi. I told him that I had turned up the heating and watched Lawrence of Arabia from beginning to end without taking a drink - he almost fell of his chair laughing!<br /><br />It is a shame that so many Saudis hold the Bedouin in such low regard. It was them who fought with Lawrence to get their country free from the Ottoman Empire's cruel rule. It is also a shame that Britain did not live up to the promises given as Lawrence was sidelined at the end of the war and lines drawn in the desert which we and the populations there are now reaping the kickback on.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|this app seems promissing and is very fun get it now it is awesome and has super cool stuff trust me.
B000MCIBE8|1.0|I fell in love with The Doors in high school in the early 90s. I had every album on CD as well as tapes of Jim's poetry, etc. etc. I recently realized that I had misplaced the first album at some point and went out to buy a new one. As soon as I put this 2007 version in my car stereo, I felt something was wrong. It sounded weak and tinny. Nothing was showing up --- not Jim's vocals, not the keyboard, nothing. I started fooling around with the bass, etc. --- something I never, ever need to do --- but it just didn't sound right. One thing that really bothered me was that on this version's \\"Break on Through,\\" Jim sings \\"She get high\\" all four times following \\"Every-body loves my baby\\". That's the wrong take. In the right take, Jim sings simply \\"She get\\" until the fourth iteration, when he issues a barely recognizable \\"high\\" at the end. The latter sounds way better. Anyways, I got home and checked the reviews of the 1990 version. Universally positive. I'm returning this one and buying the 1990. By the way, I've also recently listened to 1990 versions of STRANGE DAYS and MORRISON HOTEL and they were great --- just as I remembered them, that is, rich, with everything showing up and blowing you away. Back to the 1990 for me.
B004SJ3AXI|2.0|so I'm going around giving my opinions on apps when I come to this one it says update and I dont want to it just sounds stupid and pg13 ads really? this one chicks son got nightmares two nights in aria when a zombie ad came up two stars

B004SJ3BCI|4.0|pretty good app for kindle fire it could be better because there can be really tough challenges but that's the fun part
B007L3BMGA|4.0|I had to find out what all the fuss was about, so yes I was one of the millions who downloaded this book onto my Kindle.  During what turned out to be a very wet week away with the family I settled into to my comfy chair, heater blasting reading what I thought was going to be an eye-opener.  Well it certainly isn't a page turner but it kept me interested enough to continue to the end.  Yes there was quite a bit of eye-opening, lip-biting content but nothing I couldn't really handle.  I guess we start to get anaesthetised to all the sex and for want of a better word, \\"kinky\\" sex, it's just my generation.  However, there definitely is an audience of women who lead somewhat \\"vanilla\\" sex lives and I'm sure 50 Shades of Grey will be their guilty little pleasure.  After all is said an done, I was interested enough in the outcome of the story of Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey to download the second in the trilogy and when I find the spare time, I will get around to reading it.
B005HSL626|4.0|could be better but still fun I guess I'll give it a four I love arcade the best though its pretty easy

B005K0HDGE|5.0|Stephen King is one of my favorite authors by far. I've read almost every thing he's ever written, and he didn't disappoint with 11/22/63. I remember well the day Kennedy was shot, and I even took time out from a recent trip to Texas to visit the grassy knoll and the Book Depository, but I've never been obsessed with the events of that day, or Oswald himself, or Jack Ruby, etc. However, King had me mesmerized with the very minutia of Maria and Lee Oswalds lives leading up to the murder itself. The best part of this book for me though was the detail with which King painted the picture of life as it was in the late 50's and early 60's. He captured that era so well and so vividly that he took me completely back to my childhood more clearly than even my own memories could.  Then there is the love story and the painful choice that our flawed and reluctant hero had to make. This is one of Stephen Kings best.
B005ZUR724|4.0|has a lot of the same probertys. again not as good graphics as WoW. its really good for people who play WoW. WoW on the go. WoW= World of Warcraft.
B00135LOHY|3.0|The book was in good condition as stipulated.  However on the website and the packing slip, it said \\"good dust jacket\\" yet there was no dust jacket.  I'm keeping the book but don't like that I can control what I'm getting.  That's what the descriptions are supposed to provide to customers.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I Love playing this game with my kids and I agree that it is very addictive, however we have managed to create our village w/o spending any real money.  In response to concerns of other reviewers, I don't believe ur child can make purchases if u have a lock on access to internet.

B000NVIXDW|5.0|I think I'm addicted to MB! I listen to his CD's every time I'm in the car. With this CD \\"Call me Irresponsible\\", it's like having a little party in my speakers!

B0086700CM|4.0|great game for testing reaction speed and challenging yourself to keep scoring higher each time. EXTREMELY laggy on Kindle Fire, though. like playing an FPS with 450 ping. you can still win... but it takes a while to get used to the stutter :p

1466401885|5.0|Admittedly, it's not as well written (grammatically) as others I've read, but the story was so... Relatable (to myself anyway) that I've since read it 3 times- never have I reread a novel. Travis Maddox dramatically reigns over all other fictional \\"bad-boy\\" heros... Matter-of-fact, I have purchased a copy for my 2 best girlfriends. Hoping I can force them to read it- the way they forced me to read \\"Fifty Shades..\\"!!<br />Overall, this is a fantastic read! Highly recommended!

B008JGSM6G|4.0|its a very fun challenging game. although some levels may seem impossible, I love how u get to skip the levels. it gets boring and frustrating after a while. but still a great game in spare time
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|fun game with great graphics. Easy to pass each level. better than farmville and otherbsimilar games that I have played in the past.
B005LAIH2W|4.0|I read this novel during my teens, but I'd known about it for years, because I'd inherited my Mom's hand-made paper dolls of John Carter and Deeja Thoris and she'd talked about them to me. In short, I'm an old time second generation fan. When I heard the movie had bombed, I was sorry but not surprised. There's a vast of story of a complex warring alien world packed into this one hundred year old fiction, and it's fairly complicated, which does not please the sound-bite ADD kids of today. When I finally saw the movie, I pleasantly surprised. I can't for the life of me, really understand what went wrong, except as one writer has said \\"bad marketing and insane critics.\\" John Carter is an absolute breathtaking beauty. The CG and the costuming, make-up, world design, etc. was fabulous, and the writers broke their necks creating a credible, understandable screen play from a mass of backstory. The main characters perhaps were the problem. The body builder physiques of the leads were gorgeous, and right out of Frazeta's art, but they were overwhelmed by special effects and the thinness of the--let's face it--pulp fiction characters they played, who were, after all, written on spec one hundred years ago. I'd still give this movie two thumbs up for the love and care, for the thought and planning, and for the wonders of the incredibly inventive and imaginative Burroughsian world it brought to life.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Nicholas Sparks' Best seller,Safe Haven, takes place in the quaint seacoast town of Southport ,NC. At this time,it is being made into a movie starring Julianne Hough and Josh Duhamel.Filming is going well! The people in this area are so excited that it is being shot in Southport.Sparks' novels often take place on the Carolina coast.<br />To me, this is a story of two lonely people who come together out of need. Katie has run away from an abusive husband . She has tried several times to leave her horrendous situation ,but her detective spouse always finds her.Her safe haven or sanctuary becomes this little \\"spot of heaven\\".She meets Alex, the owner of a general store, and they begin to see each other along with his two adorable children.He knows that Katie is guarded ,and perhaps, running from something. She does lead a quiet,rather mysterious life here,but she eventually trusts Alex.<br />This is an easy to read page turner..
B000PMGS8G|4.0|This is really more of a fantasy flick than a sci fi movie. And on blu ray it looks pretty good , alot better than dvd. If you don't like campy fantasy then this cult flick is not for you. But the camp is played straight and that makes this a cool movie to watch. Queen provided the soundtrack and it's a good one too. Queen also had their 'the game' disc out that year so they were at their commercial peak at that time. The movie was panned by serious sci fi critics who just didn't get the whole idea of this movie: it was  salute to the 1930's serials of which 'flash gordon' was one of the most popular. kids back then flocked to see buster crabb on a saturday morning screening doing flash gordon. This movie was only 35 years away from that time. Those 1930's  kids were in their forties in 1980 so this would have been quite a treat for them. And it was for fans of fun fantasy too. The cast plays it up very well. this has a few extras on this but sci fi fans who want a star trek adventure need not apply here , this is over the top and like a serial from the 30's with excellent effects of it's day.  The blu ray has a few extras on it and that's about it.

B0079IEPHA|5.0|A man phones a lawyer and asks, \\"How much would you charge for just answering three simple questions?\\"<br />The lawyer replies, \\"A thousand dollars.\\"<br />\\"A thousand dollars!\\" exclaims the man. \\"That's very expensive isn't it?\\"<br />\\"It certainly is,\\" says the lawyer. \\"Now, what's your third question?\\"<br /><br />Or this one...<br /><br />Q: What do you have if three lawyers are buried up to their necks in cement?<br />A: Not enough cement.<br /><br />The USA network keeps on not effing up. Far as I'm concerned, SUITS is the newest addictive show on television, and that's me not normally drawn to legal dramas. It's witty and funny and smart and loaded with that patented easy-breezy sense of fun that the USA network nowadays specializes in. The premise is irresistible, the cast is irrepressible. The two leads, Gabriel Macht and Patrick J. Adams, are so very good. I can't not rave.<br /><br />SUITS chronicles the exploits of the prestigious New York corporate law firm Pearson Hardman. More pointedly, the catchy premise revolves around sleek newly-made senior partner Harvey Specter (Macht) who dips into shady shenanigans when he takes under his wing a college dropout who was running away from the law when he happened to stumble across Harvey's office just when Harvey was in the middle of interviewing first year associates. Turns out, there's more to Mike Ross (Adams) than just being a slacker and a weed merchant. Mike boasts an eidetic memory. He reads something, he understands it. Once he understands it, he never forgets it. It's a neat party trick. It intrigues Harvey enough, impresses him enough, that he decides to gamble on Mike. And since Pearson Hardman only ever hires from a pool of Harvard law graduates, then begins the big fib of Mike Ross, Harvey's new associate and recent Harvard alumni.<br /><br />Mike Ross is a resourceful, idealistic cat (that whole weed thing was a one-time mistake). He makes for a terrific point-of-view character. As he navigates his way around his new environment, as he learns, we learn. Will Mike sink or swim in these shark-infested waters? That's part of the fun. In just about each episode, Mike is thrown a curve, is put in a situation in which he could get exposed. Sometimes, his quick thinking and his immaculate sense of recall get him out of predicament. Sometimes, Harvey, cool as the other side of the pillow, steps in. How long can these two keep up the charade? The show dares you to step away.<br /><br />Macht, gleam all wicked in his eye and so much hair gel the headrest of his Barcalounger is afraid, embodies Harvey Specter with supreme swagger, cocky and ruthless and unruffled. Once in a blue moon he exhibits his (begrudgingly) compassionate side. Harvey is touted as the firm's go-to closer, its most heralded gunslinger. In his competitive field, it's no surprise that his colleagues are resentful. And maybe none more envious than the always scheming junior partner Louis Litt (that fabulous gopher Rick Hoffman). Hoffman is great as the perennial burr in the saddle. He quickly makes Mike's time in the firm a partly sucky one. Mike becomes the human rope in Harvey and Louis' ongoing game of tug-of-war.<br /><br />Q: What do you throw to a drowning lawyer?<br />A: His partners.<br /><br />Let me fragment sentence you: Predatory boardroom sharks, cooly preening and posturing and bedeviling clients with silver tongues, and yet graced with just enough of that bump of conscience to humanize them. I found myself suckered into that simmer between Mike and sexy, five-year paralegal Rachel (Meghan Markle). I relish the hell out of Sarah Rafferty who plays Harvey's sassy secretary Donna, and we note Donna's understated pining for her boss. In fact, the interactions among the cast members are absorbing all around. Gina Torres as the firm's steely managing (and founding) partner is the icing on the cake. The cases handled by Harvey and Mike are watchable enough, and the legalese thrown at us is madedecipherable enough. For those trying to become better people, morals and ethics are explored intelligently. Each time I side with Mike's naive nice guy perspective, Harvey extends a counter-argument which sheds a new light on the matter. My favorite moments are those in which Harvey sarcastically mentors Mike (with Mike frequently giving as good as he gets) and those moments in which Mike scrambles to maintain his Harvard cover. And I don't mind at all any scene in which the weasely Louis Litt gets what's coming to him. And let me reiterate: SUITS is FUNNY. I'm already 5 episodes deep into Season 2, and, if anything, I've gotten even more hooked. In Season 2, the stakes have shot up even more. As for Season One, get it.

B007Y2W44W|3.0|I've been a fan of Nile's for about 5 years now and know most of their works -\\"Annihilation of the Wicked\\" being my introduction. All of the albums up to AOTW were great: heavy, brutal and fast with involved instrumental interludes to give you depth (and let you breathe) from the heavier parts. With AOTW, they (in my OPINION) topped themselves with a devastatingly heavy, brutal and complex album. \\"Cast Down the Heretic\\" I would dare guess is most fans' favorite due to the extreme speed, brutal density and long solo section. The song is a supreme example of death metal technicality/brutality.<br /><br />\\"At the Gate of Sethu\\" is their latest release and while being fully Nile and fast, complex and well arranged (and the songs being well researched) there was something missing: the heavy. This album has a very \\"light\\" sound to the guitars almost like thrash guitars playing death metal. I realize Nile wanted things to be separated a bit more sonically speaking but the guitars lack depth and brutal heaviness. The bass guitar is a bit more pronounced, which is good but it doesn't help this album.<br /><br />It sounds to me like they tried to sonically separate themselves to allow the individual instruments to come out more... whatever it was, it ain't heavy. I'm not looking for Nile (or any band for that matter) to regress -I prefer bands to be progressive and develop their music.  And Nile is known for their progressive nature to keep following up each album with a great successor -this album shows the work they put in.  My complaint isn't with Nile, per se -it is with the guitar tone, and somewhat, the drum production.  I feel this album should've been beefier, heavier.<br /><br />The production just took a lot of the heavy out of this release. I mean there are some stand out tracks -\\"When My Wrath is Done\\" being a good example. Look the bottom line is this: Nile's output has been mostly consistent (\\"Ithyphallic\\"?) and this album is excellent musically and I know they worked hard on it. It just sounds like the \\"bottom\\" dropped out with the production. I recommend this if your a true Nile fan (like me) but download it if you're a passive fan.worked hard on it.

The story is simply awesome, the characters are incredibly complex and the world... OH, THE WORLD! It is simply astounding! One can't describe this piece of marvel and be fair to its wonders. I can only say: READ IT.

1612130283|1.0|I borrowed a friends copy before committing my hard earned money to buy it. My caution was mainly based on reviews here saying the writing was bad.<br /><br />\\"Bad\\" is not really the correct term for this writing. Atrocious, insipid and tedious are much better descriptives.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor; save your money. This book is only selling because the old adage is true: \\"Sex sells.\\" Unfortunately in this case it is not even a good or believable description of sex that is selling. It is maudlin garbage at best.

0521008433|3.0|I am not at all impressed with this book.  It's the required book for a graduate class I'm taking, Teaching a 2nd Language.  I have never in my life seen so many quotes in a text book.  I would say there are at least 5-6 on each page with at least one being so long, it can't be put into quotation marks, but rather has to be set off in small font with an indented margin.  It also bothers me that in most of the quotes, information is omitted.  It seems like a paraphrase would have been more practical.  Also, like I mentioned, I'm using this book in a graduate class, but I feel like it goes entirely too deep into the background of the methodologies with very little emphasis put on explanation of the process of the methodologies.  I'm sure there has to be a better book in print.

0525478817|5.0|I'm only a recent fan of John Green's video blog on youtube with his brother, Hank.  Having watched those videos for about a year now, I decided to take a chance on him and his new, young adult romance novel.  And I am very glad that I did.  This is NOT some winsome, fantastical young chick novel about true love that will never die because the lovers are immortal vampires (who wants to read about that?).  The characters are real, their love is real, and their story feels real.  The best part about this novel is that each character feels authentic.  There is no dumbing down of any of the characters at all.  They question the existence of God and heaven, the value of contemporary art and literature, and what the best kind of life should look like.  There is also honest, teenage discussions about sex and video games that anyone in the in demographic  age of 16-30 will recognize from their own high school years.  And the fact that each of the characters has cancer only intensifies the significance of each of their musings on life, death, and love.  I did feel that the climatic twist was a little too cliché, but Mr. Green certainly makes up for it in the last 70+ pages.  All in all, this is novel that young adults in the previously mentioned demographic range (and even older) will love.

B005FITIIC|4.0|Just to  repeat the earlier comments about  the excellent acting in this movie -- even in the small parts.  If you've only seen Simon Baker in his TV roles it is surprising what a cold hearted weasel he can be in a $3000 Hermes tie.
B0070NSPCU|4.0|The exciting, engaging story kept me up all night finishing it, and I headed right back to Amazon to get the next book in the series (there isn't one yet, to my chagrin). Interesting characters and a deep, lush setting make this book the best $3 I've ever spent. But the commas--comma splices ALL OVER the place, commas where there shouldn't be, no commas where there should be--became a distraction after a while. There were some other fairly minor editing issues as well. Please dont let that keep you from reading this book, though. With another set of eyeballs on the edit, this book would EASILY be worth big publishing house prices. Eagerly looking forward to the next one, and highly recommend this one.

B000002KBU|4.0|I did not know so much about Joni Mitchel's music when I took the chance and bought this album. Of course I knew some of Mitchel's best-known songs such as \\"Big Yellow Taxi\\" and \\"Clouds\\" and liked them a lot. A quick research on internet about her back-catalogue made the choice of \\"Blue\\" logical, since this particular album is usually regarded her most complete.<br /><br />At first hand the album contains no \\"hits\\", but despite many numbers are not the most accessible, it has a very accomplished feeling you can not help being drawn into. There are obviously a couple of  numbers that stick out. Not least, \\"Carey\\" which is probably the album's most catchy and upbeat. Also, the wistful \\"River\\", which I knew from a very fine cover version by Sixpence None the Richer is a favorite.<br /><br />The opening track \\"All I Want\\" may also be one of the tracks that first gets stuck in your memory. All in all a very atmospheric album that may well have gained from a couple of more songs in the \\"Carey\\" class.

B000E6EGZ0|5.0|One has only to listen to the opening ff chords of this Tosca to hear that Karajan is putting his very personal stamp on it. But this is the Karajan of September 1962 recording for Decca, and a (relatively) youthful energy courses through this personal interpretation. It is clear early on (even, by contrast, in the opening) that Karajan refers on and off to his (and most people's) favorite recording of Tosca, the Triestine Victor de Sabata's 1953 recording with Callas-Di Stefano-Gobbi and the La Scala forces.<br /><br />But those opening chords, which at a first hearing were so surprising to me they gave me goose bumps, are slower, more willful, and more stylized than de Sabata's, done almost in slow-motion, as if looked at through an acoustic magnifying glass. They introduce us into a world of power, evil and unabashed elegance (they are Scarpia's chords), and they allow the Wiener Philharmoniker to release their force and volume to the hilt. Immediately thereafter, Karajan releases his grip and launches into a lean, well-balanced, lively and romantic reading. Always a master Puccinian, he has no problem unleashing all the beauty and power of the score. It is also clear from those opening chords that the Vienna forces are superior to the La Scala orchestra. And that Culshaw's Decca recording forces are superior to EMI's 1953 team.<br /><br />Culshaw contributes delightful touches to the effort, aside from the famous Decca clarity and fullness. The bells in Scarpia's Act I dialogue with Tosca (\\"Tosca divina....\\") are realistic church bells, ever-so-slightly out of tune so as to be an ambient sound rather than integral part of the orchestra; the cannon sound before and during the slow (Warwick Thompson in his liner notes says \\"daringly slow\\") Te Deum is a distant but menacing realistic cannon sound, giving the scene a darkness that is a perfect companion piece to those opening chords. And the firing squad gunshots are believable gunshots (one of Culshaw's masterly touches appears in Karajan's Carmen from the same period: the Act III gunshot that frightens Micaela as she wanders into the gypsies' world makes me jump every time).<br /><br />It is of course true that Maria Callas is THE Tosca in the 1953 recording, and no one disputes that. She was a supreme actress, and no one can touch that. It is however also true that, to be blunt, her voice had weaknesses, weaknesses that one forgave given the amplitude of her artistry and temperament. I grew up with that 1953 Callas Tosca, and for years could not bear to compare other recordings to it. But Leontyne Price is so satisfying as Tosca that I don't feel the need to compare. Her voice is gorgeous. And, in true belcanto style, she is one of the few sopranos whose voice does not change when she moves from one register to another and does not get shriller when she reaches the high notes. Extraordinary. She may be a lesser actress than Callas at times (this is most evident in Act III), but she sings better.<br /><br />Di Stefano performs beautifully as Cavaradossi: it is true that some of the freshness has gone out of his voice in the higher register and his high notes sound throaty and strained, but for the rest he sounds pretty much the same as in 1953.<br /><br />If Callas is the paradigm for Toscas to come, I believe that Gobbi is the paradigm for all other Scarpias. I like Taddei a lot, and he is a fine singer and actor. But I confess I find myself comparing. No matter, any Olympic podium has three places, and Taddei fits on it.

B0000033RY|1.0|Man, this band was HORRIBLE! I must have unfortunately seen them about 20 times because they kept opening for bands in Buffalo where I grew up. Talk about obnoxious. I remember the one time at Gilligans when Rusty Day, the lead singer, said \\"Yeah, right now we're going to do a little country\\" and I was thinking, oh man, they are going to quiet things down...thank you! And then Jim McCarty, the guitar player, hits this GINORMOUS power chord that nearly broke my eardrums, and Rusty Day yanked the microphone off his stand and placed it down by his zipper and started to walk around on stage like he had a giant H.O. sticking out of his pants. I mean, just horrible, horrible stuff. I swear I could hear Hank Williams rolling around in his grave to this atrocity.
B0088RQ4X4|5.0|Okay, so I had no intention of ever watching this movie so I never added it to my Netflix list.  Mostly based on two facts: the critics hated it and it was a box office bomb.  That said, my teenage son borrowed it from his friend and after I told him what a bomb it was, he said that his grandma (my mom) said it was really good.  Not wanting to waste over two hours of my time, I came here to look up the reviews which were very good.  After the first 15-20 minutes I was hooked!  I thought the Tharks and Therns (?) were quite interesting races.  I loved the amazement they all had of John Carter and his jumping abilities.  And of course what kind of girl would I be if I didn't enjoy a bit of love interest.  My son thought the \\"dog\\" (or whatever it was) was very cool.  I keep wondering why this movie did so poorly at the box office and all I can think of, aside from poor critics reviews, is that they should have given it a different title.  The title \\"John Carter\\" is too main stream for a sci-fi movie.  I'm thinking \\"Return to Bardoom\\" would have been a better title...but that's just me.  There will never be a movie which will be enjoyed by 100% of it's audience but overall, I'm happy that I did see this one and would recommend!

B0009QBLA8|4.0|I love David Lynch's films, and consider him a talented and brilliant artist.  That said, I haven't been able to watch this movie since I first saw it sometime in the 1980's.  I am going to have to watch it again at some point to see how it strikes me now that 30 years have gone by, but my impression then was that it is a masterfully nauseating descent into a Freudian dream-hell exploring (among other things) the male fear of paternity.  I'm a woman, and a mother, and this movie, if I interpreted anything about it correctly, gave me the rawest, most honest insight into it might mean to some men to contemplate becoming a father...and it resonated with me. Tell me how many men can plumb their subconscious like that and translate it into visual imagery?  It's a masterpiece, without a doubt.  It's also about the farthest thing from a feel-good movie you'd ever wish to see.
0062011847|5.0|It is true, as at least one other reviewer has mentioned, that this is not strictly a \\"Watch Book.\\" Thud was also largely about Sam Vimes and this one more so. I was touched at times, to the point of tears, as was my non-rabid Pratchett fan spouse (serious issues are major topics in the book), and at times we laughed out loud. It is a deep and thoughtful book that is also an enormous amount of fun for the Pratchett fan. My entry drug for Pratchett was Feet of Clay, and I have used it to hook others into the Discworld. For a newcomer to to the Discworld I recommend that one rather that this one. But once well and truly hooked, this is a great book.

145162445X|2.0|If Krauss had titled this book \\"How did we get mass from energy fields,\\" then you would have had an accurate description of at least a few sentences of this book. (But read Frank Wilczek instead if you want an actually coherent explanation on that topic).  What you don't get is any explanation of (1) where space comes from or what it is (and surely space is \\"something\\"), (2) where the energy fields that ostensibly gave rise to quantum fluctuations that ultimately gave rise to mass came from (and surely the energy fields are also \\"something\\").  Seems like Krauss has fallen right into the infinite regress problem that Stephen Hawking describes in \\"A Brief History of Time\\":  \\"A scientist once gave a lecture on astronomy. An old lady at the back of the room said: 'What you have told us is rubbish. The world is really a flat plate supported on the back of a giant tortoise.' The scientist replied, 'What is the tortoise standing on?' 'You're very clever, young man,' said the old lady. 'But it's turtles all the way down.'\\" At first I chalked this up to the publisher just wanting a book title that would sell. But Krauss keeps repeating the same mantra over and over -- how modern physics proves that you can indeed get something from \\"nothing,\\" and therefore all philosophy and religion is a waste of time. Regardless of your views of the virtues of philosophy and religion, all Krauss has done is redefine the word \\"nothing\\" to mean \\"no mass,\\" and declare victory against the no-nothings.  This is just semantics, and doesn't contribute anything useful to the debate.<br /><br />A little more humility could also be in order as to whether the Big Bang is as certain as he is sure that it is given that, while this is the prevailing model that appears to fit with observation, there are plenty of other theories that have at least some support.
B007X4ECLY|3.0|I watched this film with a fair amount of expectation after hearing about it from a few people who went on and on telling me about how it was a glorious throwback to all those great action movies of the '80s and '90s. Unlike The Expendables, this film was supposed to devoid of meta-humor or irony, which was a refreshing idea, frankly. After all, the best B-movies in history were not made by people *trying* to make B-movies. So I rented it, settled in and rooted for Guy Pearce and co. to transport me back to the good old days...<br /><br />Let me start off by pointing out what the film does (mostly) right:<br /><br />1) It gives us the prerequisite badass antihero complete with mysterious past and snappy one-liners.<br /><br />Aaaand that's about it. Seriously, Guy Pearce's character is the only reason to think about seeing this movie. He's tough, cynical, sarcastic, professional. Too bad he's all there is to it. And to top it off, the one thing he's supposed to excel at in the movie--the action--is an incoherent mess. Within the first five minutes, there's a terrible CGI sequence that moves so fast, you don't even get the sense that anything's at stake. One thing that many so-called B-movies had (and I'm thinking of the good older ones directed by guys like John Carpenter, George Cosmatos and Joseph Zito, to name a few) was spatial coherence: you knew where everything was in a scene, where every explosion was coming from, what was at stake. Lockout, unfortunately, goes for the modern action movie method where everything moves way too fast and there's no sense of spatial logic. There is some decent gunplay in the space prison, but nothing spectacular, and not much in the way of hand-to-hand combat. What the movie's really missing is one terrific, memorable action setpiece, something that most of the films Lockout is borrowing from managed to have.<br /><br />People have described this as a blend of Escape From New York and Blade Runner. Well, the prison setting hereisn't as interesting as in Escape (and really, how could it be), and whatever dystopian future exists in Lockout is too limited by the film's low budget to compare with Blade Runner's far-reaching exploration of 2019 L.A.  The main villains are interesting, but for all their antics, they never seem to rise above the level of minor inconvenience, and they're not all that memorable. Nobody here is going to make people forget Isaac Hayes as the Duke.<br /><br />I wanted to love this movie, I really did. But at the end of the day, all we've got is one sharp lead performance surrounded by a bunch of mediocre action and CGI junk. Lockout is a B-movie among B-movies, and no, that's not a compliment.

B0002FQAZM|3.0|Look, I'll make this review quick. This isn't anywhere near a definitive Van Halen collection. Where are 'Somebody Get Me a Doctor!!,' 'Atomic Punk,' 'Ice Cream Man,' 'Cabo Wabo,' '5150,' 'Ballot or the Bullet,' and 'Can't Get This Stuff No More,' among countless others? Look, what's here is great, and the new-for-2004 tracks are great, featuring the Red Rocker in fine voice. But it just isn't enough to give this compilation high marks. There's so much missing, and the sound quality isn't that great either. It's a bit compressed. If you are a Van Halen collector, get this for the new songs, as they are quite good, and if you are an easily-pleased casual fan who wants the radio hits and nothing but, this also might be worth checking out. Otherwise, just wait a few years for Eddie and company to dig into the vaults and release the definitive Van Halen compilation, because I can almost guarantee you, that will happen one day soon. This can be skipped.
B0059XTTW8|5.0|[[ASIN:B0059XTTW8 Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy]] When I first heard about this project (in an Entertainment Weekly feature on Colin Firth after he won the Oscar for \\"The King's Speech\\") my first reaction was mixed: I've always loved the story, but wondered why they would go back and re-do a novel that was made into a 6 hour TV miniseries still considered the gold standard for TV movies. And le Carre's works have a mixed record when it comes to film adaptations, for every \\"Spy Who Came in From the Cold\\" there's a \\"Little Drummer Girl.\\"<br /><br />Then I reflected that George Smiley is just as much a pop culture icon, in his way, as James Bond or Jason Bourne or  Sherlock Holmes, and if their stories can be constantly revived, rebooted, and relaunched for each generation (or even within generations) then I guess Smiley can have his turn too.  And this film obviously has the approval of Smiley creator John le Carre, who is one of the producers and appears in a holiday party sequence (I've always heard that le Carre felt he lost control of the Smiley character after the B.B.C. miniseries, readers came to associate Smiley with Alec Guinness, who was not whom le Carre pictured Smiley -- too old, too tall, too thin).<br /><br />The story of \\"Tinker, Tailor\\"  remains basic in whatever format it appears. The aging head of British intelligence, known only as \\"Control,\\"  suspects his agency has been penetrated by a double agent working for the Soviets, a \\"mole\\" in espionage parlance. Control sends an agent behind the Iron Curtain to learn the identity of the mole, but it turns out the agent has been sent into a trap set up by \\"Karla,\\" the Russian K.G.B. agent in charge of infiltrating imperialist Western intelligence services. Control is forced to resign in disgrace. About a year later, an A.W.O.L. British spy surfaces with evidence confirming Control's suspicions. Because George Smiley has been in retirement, his innocence of being the mole is self-evident, and he is tasked withuncovering the double agent, which he does by setting a trap of his own.<br /><br />Director Tomas Alfredson and the cast, which seems to include every contemporary British actor of note with the exception of Michael Fassbender (who was originally scheduled to appear in the movie before having to bow out) does a remarkable job of bringing this quintessential Cold War story to the contemporary screen. The movie follows the general outline of the novel, with many scenes,  out of necessity,  compressed or sped-up. As with the novel, the movie skips back and forth in time, I've both read the book and seen the B.B.C. mini-series twice, and even I had trouble following  what was going on at times. One visual clue to follow is Smiley's eyeglasses (one style before he retired, one style afterward). Interestingly, however, one key flashback scene, when Smiley has his one face-to-face encounter with his  arch-nemesis Karla in New Delhi, is not dramatized, but simply recalled by Smiley as the camera stays tight on his face. The scene is mesmerizing, and I doubt few other actors could have pulled it off. Oldman really anchors the film. Compared to Alec Guinness his Smiley is a bit less passive, less of a fussy academic ostensibly bumbling his way through the world of espionage and more of a ruthless operator prepared to do whatever it takes to get the job done. (To be fair to Guinness, he does display more of this side of Smiley's character in the sequel \\"Smiley's People.\\")<br /><br />Of course, when a story of this scope is reduced to a movie with a little over 2-hours running time, some elements are lost which gave the original story much of its nuance and resonance. To me, one of the biggest losses is that of Ann Smiley, George's vivacious wife. Her role is small, but critical to understanding Smiley's character, and underlining the theme of betrayal, personal and public,  which runs throughout the story. In the film, she's a barely-glimpsed presence, her role in the largernarrative only hinted out. Also lost in the shuffle  are the characters of Smiley's fellow spy chiefs who are the suspected moles. Talented actors like Toby Jones, Ciaran Hinds, and Colin Firth do what they can, essentially working  with brushstrokes, but the Jane Austin comedy of manners style which distinguishes le Carre's work is largely lost. Still, there is some addition by subtraction here. I, for one, was glad to be spared the traitor's banal self-justification for his acts of betrayal.<br /><br />Among the other notable story changes of note are the sexual orientation of Peter Guilliam, who serves as the Watson of the story, and the location of the Ricky Tarr sequences, moved from Hong Kong to Istanbul (perhaps because they couldn't film in the former colony now that it is back in the possession of the Chinese, and perhaps Istanbul was chosen as a substitute as an Easter egg of sorts, a reference to to Kim Philby, the double agent who served as the model for the mole, who was stationed there while still working for British intelligence). Overall, the whodunnit nature of the story is downplayed, the narrative is more of a \\"how are they gonna catch him?\\" story. And yes, the film does work as a thriller. The stakes are high, people are chased, guns go off (even if the bloodshed is usually more tragic in nature than heroic), and, in one ingenious  sequence, a plane landing  on a tarmac has you sitting on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />Some have questioned if \\"Tinker Tailor,\\" even in its abbreviated form, has become a dinosaur, its pace too leisurely, its plot too complex, for today's hyped-up audiences who need everything spoon-fed to them  and have seizures if something doesn't explode on screen every five minutes or so. le Carre started writing his espionage fiction in the early 1960s as a corrective to the James Bond model permeating pop culture at the time, which depicted spying as fun, glamorous work, performed by heroic supermen  who embodied the natural superiority of Western capitalism.  To paraphrase what a literary critic once said about the mystery writer Ross MacDonald, other espionage writers write about secrets, le Carre writes about sin. Yes, he can get preachy at times (especially in his later, post-Cold War work), but at his best, such as \\"Tinker Tailor,\\" he provides absorbing thrillers that also serve as cautionary tales about the moral rot that can set in when a society, seeing itself locked in a great ideological struggle with an implacable foe, sublets its security, and its conscience, to mortal men operating in a shadowy, covert world virtually devoid of any outside control or accountability. Even in societies that like to think of themselves as the \\"good guys.\\" Especially in those societies (are you listening, Uncle Sam?). In le Carre's world, there are no \\"good guys,\\" only professionals out to inflict damage. It's all a matter of whom they inflict the damage on, how they do it, and why, that distinguishes them on the moral calculus.<br /><br />\\"Tinker Tailor Solider Spy\\" is one of those movies that are the proverbial acquired taste. Those going in expecting a Jason Bourne or Tom Cruise \\"Mission Impossible\\" style thriller will probably be reaching for the \\"eject\\" button after 10, 15 minutes or so. However, if you're a John le Carre fan, this is definitely for you. I also recommend this movie for anyone unfamiliar with le Carre but are fans of other entertainments for thinking people, genre works that are character driven, such as the \\"Wallender\\" novels and TV films, \\"Homeland,\\" or \\"Sherlock.\\"<br /><br />I'm keeping my fingers crossed this same cast and crew tackle \\"Smiley's People\\" next.
0345803507|5.0|My husband and I really enjoyed this Trilogy. Yes, there were shocking sexual parts, but we are all adults and we all have our likes and dislikes. Although, my husband and I do not get into the kinky stuff, we are in our late 40's, we do like to have fun. This trilogy has ignited a spark. We are thankful. The audience needs to remember that this is a story about a relationship, not just about sex. A good read in our opinion.

0345803485|1.0|Good grief, this has to be one of the most poorly written best-sellers in recent history.  I don't know whether it's a lack of familiarity with American English or just a complete dearth of talent, but this has been one of the most painful reads I've subjected myself to in a very long time.  In addition to a rather restricted vocabulary and a tendency to beat the same colloquialisms to death, the author seems to have had some trouble with character development and doesn't appear to have much familiarity with her subject matter.  I read this book as the result of a very harsh review on the Huffington Post website, in which the critic expresses concern over the potential influence this book may have on young women.  Frankly, I believe he gave the book far too much credit.  This book isn't going to influence anyone with an IQ over 80 and it's definitely not \\"mommy porn\\". If anything it's uneducated, cloistered high school senior porn.  Judy Blume's \\"Forever\\" was more titillating than this rubbish.

If you are lucky enough to find this cd with the bonus DVD - get it.  It documents the work behind the making of the album with video from the studio sessions. A great way for the band to celebrate 30 years since the first album. 5 STARS!!!

B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I thought this was a good but sad ending to a brilliant series... You must read it if you have read the first two though. Otherwise you're left on a cliff hanger. Like I said, this book was sad. All the characters presented differently to how they were in the last books. Peeta's absence from the book did nothing to help matters. Some of the romance feel that attracted quite a few teenaged girls to the series backed off in... not disgust... just a feeling of disappointment to how it ends up for everyone. Don't let my review put you off. The ending works, no matter how different. I don't think Suzanne Collins could have done it much better.<br />Warning spoilers!!!!<br />I felt deeply betrayed when it ended on such a sad note... The one downside to the epic finale. Katniss's family half dead and Gale pretty much gone from her life. There wasn't enough of Peeta and Katniss to keep be going.<br />And how could Suzanne Collins kill Prim? It was like Rue all over again but sadder wth no flowers or singing.

030758836X|4.0|I couldn't put Gone Girl down.  This is a book full of plot twists and turns, with characters who most definitely are not who they seem to be.  Nick's wife, Amy, has vanished.  Thus the usual hubbub that surrounds any disappearance develops.  We get to know Nick better and better as the police investigation continues.  But where is Amy, and why did she vanish?  Those are the pivotal questions and as I mentioned, people are not who they seem to be in this book...not at all.  Gillian Flynn is a writer that is quite adept at descriptive language, sometimes too descriptive.  There's some pretty explicit language and sexual situations, so those warnings should be considered before you jump into a mystery that will keep you turning the pages.  In the end, I felt psychologically violated.  Quite a book to take on a peaceful vacation, that's for sure.

B007VTVGAQ|4.0|In the mid-1990's there was a rush to expose female singer songwriters again (just like the early 1970's), and truth be told, female singer songwriters never went away entirely, but I'd reckon that Aimee Mann, Tracy Chapman, Sinead O'Connor, Toni Childs, Tasmin Archer, Sophie B. Hawkins, P.J. Harvey, Liz Phair, Tori Amos, Kate Bush, Annie Lennox and Tanita Tikaram likely were at the forefront of the movement before the movement actually happened and brought Jewel, Alanis Morissette, Tracy Bonham, Joan Osborne and Fiona Apple, among others, to the front of the line.<br /><br />\\"Tidal\\", Apple's first album, was done when she was just 18 years old, and released in July 1996, I remember working at the music store and finding \\"Shadowboxer\\" and \\"Sleep To Dream\\" very mature and interesting songs. Of course, it would be \\"Criminal\\" with its unique and provocative video by Mark Romanek that would be the lone top 40 hit everyone would remember her for. That's a shame because she's much more than that, but it's also just fine and dandy because those of us who looked past \\"Criminal\\" have known all along that Apple is a unique talent that is just waiting to be discovered once more.<br /><br />\\"The Idler Wheel\\" finds Apple baring her soul in her lyrics once more, except this time the music is raw, the vocals are at times raw, and everything has a stripped and ragged feel to it. At first I wasn't sure I liked this approach, but with repeated listening I began to like many of the tracks. Still, I think the album as a whole is lacking immediately recognizable hits. There's nothing on here that should grab you and scream, \\"PLAY ME!\\"<br /><br />On the plus side, Apple keeps it short and to the point with 10 tracks and about 42 minutes of music. Certain tracks kept my interest like the first single \\"Every Single Night\\", \\"Daredevil\\", \\"Werewolf\\", \\"Periphery\\", \\"Anything We Want\\" and \\"Hot Knife\\". As I mentioned, all the songs go nicely together without one particular song standing above the rest. For me that's the problem--I prefer to have the songs stand out from each other rather than blend together with the whole of the album being the showcase rather than each individual song.<br /><br />Apple has tried various musical approaches over the years and the music on \\"The Idler Wheel\\" is likely to divide fans due to its lo-fi recording and naked instrumentation.<br /><br />Here's how \\"The Idler Wheel\\" compares to Apple's previous works:<br /><br />1996 Tidal: Four Stars<br />1999 When The Pawn: Four Stars<br />2005 Extraordinary Machine: Four Stars<br />2012 The Idler Wheel: Three and a Half Starsrest.

B003VANOFY|1.0|I've had this headset for 8 months, during those 8 months I've had to return them twice.  Seems like the typical lifespan of either the battery or the plug mechanism is around 2-3 months at which point the plug gets really finicky on how it is able to receive the charge (aka, you have to have set the plug at a certain angle so the connection point is in the right spot to start charging) then eventually your ability to charge stops all together.  I'm currently in the process of getting my money back for this headset as the same problem has occurred within 2-3 months of my last return.  Third strike and your out Logitech.<br /><br />Now if these headsets could charge and continually be charged, heck if i could just use them plugged in, these would be great headphone, comfortable to wear, good sound quality, the wireless connection goes out for a second every now and then but for me the connection is always quickly re-established.  BUT none of that matters when you can't charge them.  They have become the most comfortable earmuffs I've ever had because I can't get sound to come out if i can't get power to them.  .........................extremely bummed.<br /><br />purchase at your own risk and if you are cool with returning them every couple of months and go for 2-3 weeks without your headset.  The return process has been fairly painless so I will give props to Logitech for that.
B006RUJST6|5.0|The author has a unique way of pulling you into the lives of Layken and Will, and their friends and families, making you feel their heartaches, cry with and share their troubles, smile with their happy moments. This is an unexpected winner, you can easily relate with any of the characters. Made me cry and laugh and smile all in the same sitting! Glad I found out about this book.
B008N1V11U|5.0|Gameloft is not always a great choice. Zip files that are HUGE on the backend and by then it's too late for a refund. THIS game is the exception. Very well made, good story, action reminiscent of Batman: Arkham Asylum/City. For a mobile game this was terrific. For a Batman game this was awesome. Worth every penny.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This is one book that I had to read again just because I couldn't get enough of Travis and Abby's intense connection. Although it follows the somewhat traditional cliche of bad-boy-meets-innocent-young-girl, the twist to Abby's unexpected 'dark' background gives their story the oomph that makes you keep on reading. Definitely YA contemporary, the writing is easy yet enticing, captures you so you want to know more how the characters develop. It's well-edited too, which is a plus (as the author's previous ebooks were unfortunately not). A good read, try it!
030758836X|5.0|You will not find a better example of this type of novel, so quit trying and read Gone Girl already! I have been a fan of Gillian Flynn's unique, darkly suspenseful writing since Sharp Objects and was not disappointed by Gone Girl. I read a ton of books but tend to steer clear of the mystery/suspense genre with a few exceptions (Tara French being one of them). Most examples of this genre are fun, quick reads but utterly predictable and not especially well written. Flynn and French fall into a new category, in my opinion: Suspense Literature. This is not the stuff of $7 mass market paperbacks that you pick up at the grocery store right next to paper plates. Gone Girl is very dark but at times hilarious...it's a page-turner but is also incredibly witty, lyrical and clever...and then there are the twists! I don't want to say anything that might in any way spoil the twists but believe me when I say you will not see them coming. I usually do...with both books and films, I can usually spot the Big Twist a mile away but not so with Gone Girl. Flynn managed to take a twist that might seem unbelievable and contrived in the hands of another mystery writer and sell it a way that is 100% believable. This is largely due to her masterful exploration of the main characters' motivations and psyche. I cannot say a single bad thing about this book. For those of you who loved Flynn's earlier work but find themselves confused after reading the cover blurb, don't worry. Flynn did not jump genres and decide to write a Joyce Carol Oates-like novel about the demise of a marriage. She brings everything you loved about Sharpe Objects and Dark Places and applies it to what turns out to be one of the most terrifying answers to one of life's biggest questions: How well do you really know your spouse?
B001B3MCQK|3.0|The quality of the voice and music is wonderful, but the lyrics seem to be rather misogynistic.<br />\\"I Wonder\\" is catchy but I felt a bit offended by the insinuational message of intolerance of a<br />woman having multiple sexual partners.
B007L3BMGA|4.0|I have just finished reading the Fifty Shades trilogy.<br /><br />I was drawn in by the two main characters, Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey.  Christian gives the appearance of a strong and ruthless businessman, but on a personal level he is revealed to be sensitive, insecure and even fragile.  On the other hand, Anastasia appears shy, meek and vulnerable to the world but eventually shows herself to be a strong, confident and determined young woman.  Despite their differences and the obstacles in their path, they are ultimately a perfect match for each other.<br /><br />There are plenty of likeable side characters and interesting twists and turns in the story.<br /><br />As many others have stated, I don't think that either this book or the others in the series (Fifty Shades Darker and Fifty Shades Freed), is particularly well written.  My main criticism is that there is a lot of repetition - an understatement really.  (And one cannot help but wonder if Apple and Audi paid to have their products endorsed in the book.)<br /><br />In the end, Fifty Shades is a love story with the usual anticipated happy ending, but with lots of spice and heat.

B00004SAAY|4.0|I bought this box set as being the only one containing all the harpsichord concertos I needed to complete my Bach collection. Fortunately, I had the chance to have a short demo at Amazon, thus allowing me to know those were satisfactory versions for the pieces I was looking for. Even being just an amateur listener, I've developed over the years some taste in barock music, notably Bach's, so I can confidently say the versions of the harpsichord concertos are all far above average, and would even dare to say, at least for BWV1063, it's well among the best you can have. So, for the price I paid, this was not only worth, but a complete success in terms of fulfilling my expectations.<br />Unfortunately, the same does not apply for the violin concertos of the 5th. and last CD. They lack both in what I'd call depth and sonority. Some of the middle slower movements are almost dull. BWV1043, my favourite one,  seems to have been performed in a rush, there's absolutely no delicateness to recognize there. So, if opposite to my case, you are looking for these pieces, this is definitely not the right choice.
B000FCKGPC|3.0|I would basically suggest this book is a fine addition to the series, but the weakest I have read so far. (I have yet to read past this particular entry.)<br /><br />It felt like a detour leaving some of my favourite characters behind to focus on others; While at the same time setting up new or under-utilized players for future events.<br /><br />I want to stay interested but I feel like I need my 'main' characters to be back in the spotlight.
1400069289|5.0|Dughigg quotes the famous psychologist William James in the prologue for this book, \\"All of our life, so far as it has definite form, is but a mass of habits.\\"  He spends the rest of the book supporting this statement and describing research that suggests how we can begin new and replace old habits.<br /><br />For a book like this to be successful it needs to be entertaining as well as illuminating and it is both of those things.  The early chapters talk about how habits are formed in our brains and how marketers have learned to exploit this knowledge.<br /><br />Most of the author's points were not new to me but I did like the chapter on \\"Keystone habits.\\"  These are habits that can influence other habits.  Willpower is the strongest of keystone habits and Duhigg explains ways we can strengthen our willpower.<br /><br />There are many anecdotes in this book used to illustrate points.  Some are about people you have probably never heard of and some are about more familiar people and organizations such as:  Tony Dungy, Michael Phelps, Starbucks, and Rosa Parks.<br /><br />Changing habits takes work but it also requires an understanding of how habits are formed and nurtured.  Dughigg explains the habit cycle and refers  back to it often.  He even includes an appendix to summarize earlier chapters.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book.  It was a page turner, well researched, and filled with useful information one can use to actually change his or her life for the better.
1250000971|5.0|Just started reading it - appears to be as good as the first of the Trilogy.  You can't go wrong with Jeffrey Archer - he is a master at telling a story.
B000GCFX3Q|5.0|Love Marian Keyes. Especially love her books about the Walsh girls.  They could be my sisters! Keyes delves into heart break, human fraility, alcohol abuse, domestic nelect/abuse with the insight of one who has been there. Yet she does this with a sense of humor & redemtion. Keep these stories coming!
B00785P2QC|5.0|great game. unable to go a day without checking in on the city. purchasing more lots to expand your city is a great addition. G5 games are great.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I bought the version direct from Amazon and it came with a free streaming copy.<br /><br />Seriously, buy this DVD.  Even if you don't like working out.  Even if you don't like Jillian...both of those apply to me.  Between warm up, 3 circuits and stretching, it's a whopping total of 27min. That felt wimpy to me the first day...just 27min?  What could that possibly do?  It could kick my butt...and it did.  I was just as sore after the first day of this as I was doing an hour long bootcamp fitness program last year.  The soreness gets much better after a couple days but the results are impressive.<br /><br />I'm doing this workout each morning with 1 rest day after each level (so 10 days of level 1, one rest day, 10 days of level 2, one rest day, 10 days of level 3). I'm starting level 2 tonight and I already have a flatter tummy and more defined waist(though my body fat % is still too high to see abs, I can tell they're there now!), much more toned arms with increased strength, stronger and more toned calves, and smaller and much more toned thighs (yay for no more jello thighs).  I like that she does 3min strength, 2min cardio, 1min abs and repeats 3 times.  It's long enough that you really feel it but not long enough to get bored or discouraged.  I'm not dieting but I am watching my calories and mostly making healthy eating choices.  I used MyFitnessPal to calculate my maintenance level calories and added 200 because I felt I wasn't able to work out to my full capacity on what they calculated.<br /><br />So far all I've needed is a yoga mat and small hand weights (I use 5lb for some moves, 3lbs for others like anterior raises).  This is a good one if you have limited space as I do.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|I enjoyed this movie as did my wife. It has good elements of humor, suspense and mystery. I wouldn't expect a phenomenal movie adventure with this however a good way to spend $3 and enjoy an adventure on the TV. It's fairly predictable but that doesn't make it any less fun.
044024630X|1.0|So I needed something to read so I picked up this book at the airport bookstore. Yes, I paid full price for this. :(  ... Even so, I needed to post a review here on amazon, PS: I love you guys, forgive me this transgression of purchasing elsewhere.<br /><br />First of all SPOILER ALERT ** Devereoux is a MORON! If she wasn't involved in the murders then she sucks at her job. She didn't bother to question key witnesses and didn't bother to investigate the crime scene behind the bar or elsewhere. Plus, with the one victim having gravel burn on her butt, she should have immediately thought about the previous victim's crime scene which was on a gravel mound ... even though that wasn't where the lady got those marks, it should have still crossed her mind. .... NO police officer is that stupid. PERIOD! If she is, she needs to lose her job and Jack shouldn't have started a relationship with her. And the comment she made about not investigating the other murders because people don't get pissed when black people are murdered is a load of crap. While it may or may not be true ... it's a small town with nothing else to do. It's not like it's New York where you have to pick and choose which cases to investigate ... there are three cops and no crime apart from roudy base personell on the weekends. She could have at least attempted to question people or run an investigation. It's like she simply said, oh, it's a black girl and let the matter drop. She didn't even ask people about their dating histories or whereabouts.<br /><br />Another thing ... Jack is killing people and covering it up ... also covering up the crimes of the Army. What a piece of crap. He isn't any better than the murderer he was trying to expose. Just because he has some sence of duty and honor, that justifies his blatent killing of those involved? He disserved to lose his job ... and much more.<br /><br />This was my first and last Jack Reacher novel.
1596912375|5.0|If you like WWII spy novels, N.Y. and Hedy Lamar, this book is for you.  The book adds Russians into the mix instead of just Ivy League & Oxford vs. mean Nazi.  And some Baader-Meinhof is added to the mix, as well.  The book is not perfect, with people doing things a sane person would not do, but it is nonetheless a great read with interesting characters and a good story.  Worth the time, certainly.

B0068RHGJM|5.0|If you liked \\"Nightwish End of an Era\\", I would highly recommend you purchase \\"Imaginaerum\\" to your collection of CDs.  They have a new lady singer on this CD and personally I prefer her voice over the other one.  Both singers are excellent, but have their own unique style. My husband says that he can't find one song on this CD that he doesn't like.
B004Q7DQLS|5.0|I am kicking myself for waiting so long to read this book. If you have not read it GO, GO NOW and BUY IT! I loved this book. The characters were so incredibly real. The character dialogue was wonderful. That statement encompasses all of the characters, not just the hero and heroine. It is a fresh original read. The types of paranormal beings range from dragon to gryphon to dark fae to the big shocker of what the heroine turns out to be. I love stories where the non-humans and the humans are living amongst each other knowingly. I also enjoy a book where there are a variety of different beings living and working together in the tale. This book has so many positives going for it. There is a very sweet love story going on with some steamy sex scenes, but the romance between Pia and Dragos so affectionately loving.  Then to top all of that off you get some fighting, action and chest pounding alpha male Neanderthal behavior.<br /><br /> Dragos is such an interesting male. He is old, older than everything else old. His Twizzler, Slurpee, and Ziploc bag confusion is reason alone to read this book. His manipulative use of the word please makes him such an honestly real character that can easily be connected to. Then you throw Pia into the mix. She is young, young even by human year standards. She is being haunted by one bad decision. It is a decision that every woman has made. She dated the wrong man for a brief period in her life. Now this ex that she wishes she could forget is blackmailing her into stealing from the much feared local dragon. She knows that the people that are behind him in doing this have nefarious plans for her. She also knows that the dragon will kill her when (not if) he finds her. Pia is a smart witty girl. She tries her best to do a little harm as possible while committing a crime she doesn't want to commit. Her mother ingrained in her for as long as she can remember to not trust others with her secret, always be prepared to run and never let anyone know what you are. She ends up in the home of a dragon who is demanding her to stay, trust him and tell him everything.<br /><br />I must say I am looking forward to reading how many different tricks Trick's has up her sleeve. Yes, pun intended. My only complaint about Dragon Bound is the size of the font. Just to make sure I am not in need of glasses I actually counted lines in various mass market paperbacks. Most have 35-37. Dragon Bound has 40 lines per page. The type is smaller. I know it's a crazy lame very minor complaint.<br /><br />Dragos to Pia \\"I see the lunatic inhabiting your body is alive and well.\\" (I really LOVE these two!)<br /><br />this is my opinion and not a paid reviewnow what you are.

B000W03RHQ|5.0|We were at our friends house and he said that he wanted my husband to see this DVD of a group that he just happened upon. After hearing the first song my husband was hooked and it was \\"Nightwish End of an Era\\".  Since that night my husband has purchased a number of DVD's and CD's to keep for himself and also given away as gifts. In talking about them, we found out that our new daughter-in-law has been listening to Nightwish since she was sixteen and she is now twenty three.  As luck would have it, Nightwish will be performing here in S.L.C. at the end of September and my husband, son and his new wife already have their tickets and can't wait to see them.  Every chance my husband has to watch a DVD, it's always \\"Nightwish End of an Era\\" and you can tell when he is coming home from work because he has his stereo cranked up listening to them on their CD.  I would recommend this DVD and CD to anyone who has an open mind and are looking to expand their taste in the different types of music we have out there now.

B0030Y11XS|3.0|Michael Moore is one of the most cynical individuals in one of the most cynical of businesses:  entertainment.  In \\"Capitalism:  A Love Story,\\" Moore self-righteously attacks the American kleptocracy, while doing the very best that he can (with his pot-belly, lackadaisical demeanor, and scruffy clothes) to help us ignore the fact that he's one of the world's most famous filmmakers, and thus a certified member of the 1%.<br /><br />Moore does make some good points in the film, but there are many more times when his credibility is questioned.  I've done quite a bit of reading, and I've never once heard that the rich were taxed 90% during the gilded age (quite frankly, there was no income tax before World War I), and that this money was used to build up America's middle-class through public expenditures in education and health care.  I've never heard about FDR's second Bill of Rights, one that guaranteed economic security to America's middle-class (wouldn't that make America socialist?).<br /><br />Of course, hypocrisy and credibility issues have always shadowed Moore's career.  Unfortunately, this film is also boring.  It's entirely predictable and monotonous, and it seems like a rushed product to take advantage of the Occupy Wall Street movement.
B000002GVO|1.0|CD was advertised as a \\"remastered\\" version of the original release.  Product received was same as original pressing only manufactured in Argentina without any kind of quality upgrade whatsoever.  Very disappointed with product and Movie Mars, Inc.
B002RPR6DU|5.0|Considering the age of this film it still holds up on all counts even by today's standards.  I am no tree hugger but I do care for the environment. If at the end of this film you do not have a lump in your throat when Joan Baez sings and the drone is gardening and planting, YOU HAVE NO SOUL.
0740745271|4.0|This is great exercise. I always wondered how they make these. When you master these, the figures just pop at you. When you have been working on the computer, using the book really relaxed your eyes and allows you to concentrate longer. I converge my eyes and the diverge. i went through 8 months of visual therapy after my laser surgery, and they used these books in my therapy. Now I have my own. I am not blown away by all the pictures, but some are awesome. the others are nice.  All are helpful.<br />P.S. I couldn't do it at first. Just keep trying!
B007ZMD14I|4.0|Excellent guitar driven rock from not one but two icons.  While Slash is the more seasoned and probably well-known veteran icon, there's simply no mistaking Myles Kennedy.  His voice stands out in a way and evokes a rock style that is out of the reach of most hard rock lead vocalists, that have to yell or channel the cookie monster to make their often-too-pretty voices sound rugged.  And as for Slash... well what do you expect me to say...it's Slash for badassness sake.  If anything he makes you feel like his previous work was leading the way to this.  To borrow from Chuck Berry, \\"he can play the guitar like he's ringing a bell\\".  When listening there's no doubt you're hearing a master guitarist at work.<br /><br />Any Guns and Roses fans should already have this...and if you don't, fix that problem you didn't know you had by getting this now.

0465092764|3.0|The real problem is the field of Origins is pursued only by Atheists or agnostics who lean atheist. So the rest of us go into Medicine or Business instead of searching for something we ultimately already know. Even though belief in a Creator has dominated all of human history --we have the only people who dont see what everyone else see's in all of 3 seconds in charge of Creation. Its almost too sad and laughable at the same time but certainly predictable.<br /><br />While I agree with the authors assertions that String(it doesn't deserve to have theory after it as evolution and relativity have earned) is a an untestable reach towards wish making I think its connection with multiverse is the real identifier of its proponents blindness to its failure.<br /><br />As noted, when people like Brian Greene misrepresent the legitimacy and merits of String Idea to the masses on TV with not a single mention of even the possibility of a Creator and instead propose junk sci-fi as a real alternative, to him its not even an alternative, it clearly exposes bias which has led to pseudoscience.<br />The masses want to understand the mechanisms used in creation but these people have betrayed the public by introducing such philosophy as multiverse while giving no mention to the philosophy of a Creator. Multiverse is not science--its an attempt to avoid the overwhelming evidence for finetuning. So you either leave out both are include both.<br /><br />I also wholeheartedly agree that the String Idea is not beauty but an ad hoc list of ever changing fudge factors. Something devastating has happened to science--its not science anymore and has been highjacked by glory seeking wish makers.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|The book was ok.  Thus far I don't see what all the hoopla is about,  most of it is just sex.  Not a whole big story line.  I guess you could \\"read\\" into things, but I don't see what the big deal is,  I've started book two...we shall see...
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I read all three books,\\"Fifty Shades\\", After I got through the first book, I began to see what a great story it was.  So far it is hard to get books fast enough, so I read only on my Kindle, thanks for that to. It is great!
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|My kids 7 & under love watching this movie. Because it is such a great example of perseverance, compassion and empathy we don't mind them watching it over again.
B00846REIS|1.0|This is one of the worse books I have ever read!  The story goes no where.  There is no plot, nothing.  The family the author writes about are each dealing with their own issues, but there is no real story.  The suicide part of the book touched me deeply, as I lost a child to suicide.  Other than that, I wouldn't read another book by this author.  Empty, boring reading.

B000067DNC|5.0|A must have follow up for all SG-SG1 Fans! Answers all questions from the previous Season! Follow Teal'C, Carter, Jackson, and of course; Richard Dean Anderson as Colonal O'Neil in this adventurous, scifi, action series!  Introduces new characters such as;  The Tok'ra, The Gamekeeper, The Salish, A Rather Groovy SG1, The Retoo Race, Ma'chello, to name a small few. There is of course a few battles with Apophis, SG1's private battles that they must overcome.  I haven't tired of watching this season yet, and so far it is one of my favs!  Would reccommend for any real SG-1 fans out there.
B0086700CM|3.0|does this game take up alot of storage place???? on the kindle fire and how do u get rid of apps???
B0000844I8|4.0|A must have for any Stargate Fan, as this is the movie that started a Scifi Cult Following!<br /><br />This movie gives an excellent beginning for the SG-1 spinoff.  And is intergalactic in the timeline of all the Stargate spinoffs.<br /><br />As far as the movie itself, it is mildly interesting and worth the purchase.  As a stand alone buy, I'd give it an 8/10 easily.  As far as the series goes however, there are a few disappointing attributes, one of which being the lead role played by Kurt Russell, who although does an adequate job, I'd personally have rather seen this role cast Richard Dean Anderson, it is however a personal bias as I believe he embodies the character of Colonal Jack O'Neil on a far more believable level than Russle.<br /><br />I do have to ask though, 'Why is the alien not a Gou'ld?'<br /><br />It is really the only letdown for this movie, and a huge plus for 'Children of The Gods'.
0439023513|1.0|First of all I really liked book 1 and 2 of this series, but I was really disappointed with this book. One of the things I really liked about the previous two books was the strong compelling character of Katniss Everdeen. In the first two books Katniss was a very passionate strong willed, crafty, and clever character that you couldn't help falling in love with. In Mockingjay Katniss has turned into an angry neurotic traumatized girl constantly on the verge of a nervous break down. The moments in this book where Katniss shined were few and far between.<br /><br />The other major flaw in this book was the focus it has on the camera/media portrayal of Katniss. For me there was too much time spent on style and makeup. Katniss spent more time than ever in this book working in front of the camera on semi scripted scenes to combat the capitol as a propaganda tool. I find all the style and makeup boring, I wanted to here about her heroic battles against the capitol, but it only happened on an occasion or two.<br /><br />Lastly the ending of this book was strange, in the last couple of chapters they killed off all the wrong people in a screwed up way. If the author was trying to make me mad, it worked. With out giving it away the book has a very dark ending and a twist right near the end that the author fails miserably to fully explain. I can only assume that Suzanne Collins wanted us to never know the truth, which for the final book in the series I think is a mistake. About the only thing I think Collins got right was who Katniss doesn't necessarily choose, but ends up with.<br /><br />To summarize the author ruined the main character, spent too much time on boring style/makeup, killed off all the wrong people, and had a dark twist at the end that she didn't fully explain. At least Katniss ended up with who I wanted her to. 1 out of 5 stars.

B0054R6BFM|1.0|This book is TERRIBLE. The girl who commits suicide is completely selfish. I've been through more, and know others who have been through SO much more, and never once thought suicide was the best option. Especially making it known to everyone who had done something to them, and not even in a bad way, why they killed themselves on a tape. Who does that? I read the reviews on the Barnes&Noble website and the majority of them said not to read the book, and I wish I listened. I was surprised to see so many people on here actually recommending the book. Please, PLEASE take the ones who said this book is garbage for their word, and don't waste your money.

B0085HWZ9Y|4.0|I dig this DVD; it's such a cool and classy performance from Robert Plant and the Band of Joy. The concert offers a wide variety of songs that are done in a way that you wouldn't expect, and the individual acts by Buddy Miller, Darrell Scott and Patty Griffin all add to the diversity of this show. I especially like their rendition of Robert Plant's solo work from 1993 \\"Down To The Sea\\" and \\"In The Mood\\" from 1983. I can easily say this will be one of my \\"Go-to\\" tapes when I want to watch a quality performance. \\"Thank you Mr. Plant for all the terrific music throughout the years!\\"

B001SGEULA|5.0|Bought it the day it came out in 1997 and hated it, although I did buy 2 of the UK singles just for the B-sides (which WERE awesome), btw.  Was completely different than their 1st 2 awesome CDs so I shelved it after 1 listen.<br /><br />Fast forward to 2010...found it in my cd case and played it and have not stopped playing since.  It's BY FAR their best CD.  If only I had played it more than once back in '97.  This is a disk you need to play more than once cause it is different from anything they did(at the time).  The guitars are awesome....it's Oasis in rockout ROCKSTAR mode...simpley incredible.<br /><br />My go-to Oasis CD (along with the live CD from 2000)I listed to this CD at least weekly, sometimes more.<br />Wish I could give it more than 5 stars...it's that good.<br />Get the remastered version, though.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book should not be read unless you read book one.  It is a continuation of book one, but it is shorter.  Just as you get into it, it ends then leaves you hanging for book three.  Buy book two and three together so you can continue the series.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I like this game because it can hold my attention and is not boring. The only think I dont like is the energy goes fast. the investments are hard to get if you don't have a facebook or twitter.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This is worth the reading if you had book one and two. Longest of the three books. A lot of juicy parts. I recommend it to everyone who read one and two.  This series is similar to the twilight series but for the adult and has mature details.

B0002Z0EYK|5.0|Such a classic: tragic Greek tale of heros and heroines. From the Iliad by Homer. Paris, the coward prince of Sparta, kills Achilles with a bow and arrows. Agamemnon, the vain and cowardly King of Greece, killed by sweet Briseis, lover of Achilles and relative of Priam (Peter O'Toole), King of Sparta. Unfortunately, my DVD sticks and stops in a few places. I still love it. Nicely packaged and promptly delivered.

B006VFLIYK|5.0|The book held my attention from the very beginning all the way through. I have never read and novels like this before, in the past I was more interested in books like Eragon, Hunger Games and young adult novels. But lately I've started reading Thrillers and Mystery novels and this one especially caught my attention from the first time I read the synopsis. I recommend this to young adults and adults alike, it is realteable to all ages since it includes both adults and children and main characters. I found Julie to be especially interesting, being thrown into the middle of a government conspiracy. Seems like a fresh and new approach.
B008MEM24S|5.0|its super duper fun :) especially if u r a perry the platypus lover like myself :) its also a great app thats a fun puzzle for any age ;)
B006ZCWTV0|5.0|Not only is this a great album, it is one of the best I have ever heard. I am serious. Bruce hits the nail on the head here, exposes the true vilians, and offers hope for the future.<br /><br />\\"Land of Hopes and Dreams\\" is even better live, as is \\"Wrecking Ball.\\" \\"Death to my Hometown\\" is a classic. Why this album didn't garner more Grammy attention I'll never know?<br /><br />After \\"Queen of the Super Market\\" I feared that Bruce was losing it.
B008KRJWEK|5.0|this game is so freaking awesome I cant stop playing buy the game it's approved to be one of the best of flu mobile
B008MEM24S|5.0|This game is much better than Where's My Water, and works wonderfully on my Kindle Fire. Does not work on my HTC Sensation though. Starts out easy, then the puzzles get harder. Oh, and very addictive. :D
B007KOYEOC|4.0|Great easy read.  Definately a bit raunchy but nothing I found offensive.  Most series have a lull or you only read them to finish what you started but this was good all the way.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|it's a great game and very entertaining. I would recommend to other people. very addicting and we wish there were more games to collect point and acorns
0345803485|1.0|I consider myself to be a very well-read person, but I also enjoy a good fanfic from time to time. I was already skeptical about this book because I had heard it was Twilight fanfiction, which is like making a copy of an already terrible copy, but I decided to give it a chance and borrowed it from the library. I'm so happy I didn't spend money on this. Fifty Shades of Grey is literally--not figuratively--the worst book I've ever read. This is the kind of garbage that sits in the slush pile on an editor's desk and never EVER gets published because it's so clearly terrible. How this one slipped through the cracks, I'll never know, and how it became a best-seller and a national phenomenon makes me question the judgement of my fellow human beings. Don't waste your money on this; if you insist on reading it, borrow it from a library or a friend. If you're only in it for the sex, I'm fairly certain you could find amateur pornography on the internet with more imagination and better dialogue and plot development. Both Maurice Sendak and Ray Bradbury died this summer, and yet the inexplicable popularity of this book is by-far the greater literary tragedy.
B006KSAPV0|4.0|If you want to fully enjoy \\"The Skin I Live in\\" (\\"La piel que habito\\"), the latest film by Pedro Almodóvar (\\"All About My Mother\\" \\"Talk to Her\\"), perhaps you should not see the film's trailers which I think reveal too much. All you have to know is that Antonio Banderas plays Dr. Robert Ledgard, a genius scientist and plastic surgeon, and that the story is about a horrible secret about \\"the skin someone lives in.\\"<br /><br />Almodóvar keeps a measured pace in the film's first half, where you will meet most of the principal characters. Elena Anaya plays Vera Cruz (yes, that's her name), a beautiful woman who, it seems, is held captive in a beautifully decorated room monitored by cameras. Be patient and follow the small clues as to what really happened to the doctor and the woman.<br /><br />Based on a French writer Thierry Jonquet's novel, \\"The Skin I Live in\\" unfolds like a Hitchcock thriller with Banderas, who looks like a darker version of Cary Grant. Part melodrama, part crime drama, the film is also a love story - not a usual one, of course. Pedro Almodóvar tells the story with confidence, and if the film is not scientifically convincing, it is still chilling and thrilling, especially in the second half.<br /><br />Finally, in \\"The Skin I Live in\\" Antonio Banderas delivers one of his career best performances. If I am not mistaken, Almodóvar and Banderas have not worked together since \\"Átame!\\" that was made in 1990. I would like to see them working together again.
030758836X|5.0|One of the best books I've read in a long, long while.....it twist and turns like few other books I've read and doesn't settle for a pat ending. I couldn't put it down and it kept my head spinning for hours. Haven't read Flynn before but you can bet I will now!
B008MEM24S|5.0|Asome and fun<br />it gets addicting I can not stop playing I m already. on the second mison and I just got it yesterday
B007IXWKUK|1.0|Nooo, please!! I didn't like the style of this novel and I won't buy the second....very poor! I don't understand why is a Best Seller....
B0054JZC6E|4.0|some of the games are silly and some of them are a little difficult it was not what I expected when I down loaded it!
1466401885|5.0|Read this on vacation and couldn't put it down. Write more like this please!! I loved the characters and the development of their relationship over time. I found myself rooting for their happiness. My family felt ignored but this was so good!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|pretty fun app but my update download didn't work, so I'm stuck with the unupdated version... someone please fix this...<br />  but I still reccomend this app pretty fun:)
0671027344|5.0|It was pretty much brand new quality and it shipped quickly. The book itself is really good! A friend recommended it and it had great reviews, which all met expectations. Very easy to read, connects to the reader, and is entertaining.
034580404X|5.0|This trilogy was such a good read! I started it and just couldn't put it down til I was done! I have given it to my friends and they are saying the same thing!
B0086700CM|4.0|Works well on the kindle! Not so great on my phone...not sure why. Otherwise I would have rated it 5 stars.
B008MEM24S|5.0|so the game itself is an expansion to where's my water... that said it blows its predecessor out of the sewer! As far as I've seen/played, steam is a great addition! That mixed withthe voice actors of the show makes it well worth a measly 99 cents! Just the right price!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|love it. really easy and fun. I like it when the flying squirrels come out. samurai s are cool. zombies are cool. the game is cool.
B008IBPECW|5.0|I watched both seasons with Amazon Prime --You do need to start with episode 1, season 1 to fully grasp everything that is going on. I absolutely loved this series, more than a lot of series. I am the typical \\"escape\\" from reality viewer liking classics like charmed, once upon a time, you get the drift, but this was a truly facsinating series, maybe because its based somewhat on true events?
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I highly recommend this app to anyone.  Being able to switch versions is invaluable in studying the Word.  I carry it with me everywhere and appreciate being able to read my favorite passage whenever I want without having to carry my  regular Bible around all the time.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Now that the requirement for Internet access is gone, the game is great once again! Go save the world Perry!
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Books like this are a reason to love the Kindle. Who is this guy who wrote this book? The truth is who cares. With 233 great reviews is enough for me to read it. After reading this full length novel(not a fan of the shorts out there) this proved to be a great book. Will buy any in this series in the future. And will definately purchase any full length novels from this author.
B003QOCTOM|1.0|Warning: Buy the HD episodes! Don't waste your money on these ones. I can't believe Amazon charges $1.99 for these horrible quality videos! Other than that, the show is great :) But you'll enjoy it much better in HD.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I love it! It's really really east at first. But when you get past the first fifty or so they get really hard. I'm stuck right now, but it's a relaxing game that doesn't require too much thought.
B002VECM6S|5.0|I have seen this movie before and loved it. It was my grand daughters favorite movie. So I bought it for her for Christmas along with a DVD player and she was so thrilled. Thanks.
6304493681|5.0|This movie was very good, I remember seeing it when i was about 10 and I from then on I wanted to own it, then when I finally could find it 6 years later I did, if you're a fan of anime buy this movie you will love it.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|This book seemed to treat bondage, torture, and other such deviant behavior as being a little too close to \\"normal\\" for my taste.  Made me uncomfortable to the point that I wanted to just put it down at times.  There is nothing like a satisfactory ending - I realize that the plan is that you should buy the next book to find out what happens.  But I didn't like the first book well enough to make me want to buy the second.
B0078JOAOI|5.0|I LOVE this series!<br />Walking Dead is the ONLY reason I started a Netflix account!<br />I HAD to buy the episodes from season 2 here in Amazon, cause Netflix doesn't have the second season up yet.<br />I am like The Walking Dead junkie now!<br />This series beats the hell out of Resident Evil!
B002MQYOFW|1.0|The reason for the low rating is that I have been unable to download this book & others I have purchased recently to my kindle? Please advise!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|It's something I recommend to everyone!!! I like luv it a lot. Everyone who as ever wanted an alarm clock I recommed this one(:
B00062IDCO|5.0|Great last season of Star Trek Voyager.  I love the episodes that had humor in them like Body and Soul, and Author Author.  And of course the last episode End Game was wonderful and heart warming.  A must see for any fan.  Captain Janeway kept her promise and got her crew home.

B000SEFNMS|5.0|For me this was a very fast paced, easy to read book. I found myself thinking about the story when I wasn't able to read.  A story of a young man that it dissatisfied with life and wants to make a change. Haven't we all thought about just disappearing for a while? He leaves home without telling anybody where he is or where he is going.<br /> I didn't agree with the way he went about doing this. He was a bit self-destructive, I felt.<br />Good story though.
B0071DJZZA|5.0|I didn't think I would enjoy it but couldn't put it down .i could wait to get the next two book . Awsome read
B001KOFH2G|5.0|Serenity is an all time classic movie by Joss Whedon and I already had it on DVD but had to get a copy in Blu-ray for my collection. Not only does it now have great definition but it also has heaps of extra features about the Serenity/Firefly verse.
0345803507|5.0|I would like to say that this was the first time i read three books in four days....The story line was captivating and never wanted it to end.E.L. James toke my mind through some deep dark tunnels of human desires and emerged at the end with bright light of human redemption and acceptance.I want more!!!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Couldn't believe a woman wrote these books..<br />Very entertaining!! Full of surprises.. Really enjoyed it. Held your attention.<br />Only read at night and couldn't wait to get back to it.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I had to read this as i,d heard so much about it, but found myself struggling to finish it. I got so bored with the imature twaddle, if she said \\"oh my\\" one more time, i swear i was going to throw my kindle through the window, and i,m surprised she has any lips left as she chewed them every five minutes, he raised his eyebrows every second. On the whole i found the story line very childish along with the way it was written. I really dont think i,ll bother with the second edition
B00785P2QC|3.0|it's. a lot of fun but I don't like the fact that you need to use REAL money to finish the game or to even get to higher levels. also don't like that it keeps asking you to post EVERYTHING on facebook.
B00785P2QC|4.0|its close to what i wanted (sim city) and i found it to be almost as fun. if the money was a bit easier to make and if it were more like sim city I'd like it more. still a great app though!
B005HJWWW8|4.0|this little guy packs a lot of punch. i was having to put the volume on 60 or 70 percent to get decent volume on my laptop while using the headphone. with this amp just 25 percent volume is loud enough for me. really brings the juice out of your headphone.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this series!!! I was worried the whole thing was gonna be about sex but it actually has a great plot throughout the whole series.
1451673442|4.0|Everything is ok and I've received the correct book. The timing was ok. The price was ok. I will indeed make a Nother order in the future.
034580404X|1.0|it took forever for the story to begin. Once started it was boring. Too much back and forth  Not my idea of a good story
B008861R7S|5.0|This is what true Wu-Tang fans have been waiting for!!! Liquid Swords remastered on disc one and instrumentals on disc two...Oh yeah The Gza...The Rza...
B006BDHAX0|5.0|See how fast you can clear each level. The faster you are the more stars you get! Less than 5 min earns you 3 stars. That's the best!
B007SY3CEW|5.0|Piano Master is awesome. I can play piano! Just follow the notes and it tells you if you are right or wrong. It also gives you a grade from A to F so you can see your progress. I love it. Get this app.
B0081L37Z0|4.0|I really enjoyed \\"21 Jump Street's\\" sense of humor. Over and over again, there'd be a gag that was extremely clever and funny while never sinking to Will Ferrell territory. This could so easily have been another \\"Starsky & Hutch,\\" but Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill are better than Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson. The biggest surprise was Brie Larson, who could be the next Emma Stone. Just a really funny actress who never went over the top and was truly likable. Also, the Cameo. The Cameo was the best and most natural thing I've seen that actor do in years.
0062014102|5.0|Among the best books I have read when it comes to serious cutting-edge thinking.  This will change your way of thinking about life, the universe and everything.... if it doesn't, take your brain to the tip!
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book was slow starting but picked up fast and furious.  It was hard putting it down.  The story & characters are \\"different\\".  If you like \\"Defending Jacob\\" you will like this book.  BUT my major complaint was the ending.  It did not tie things up and a very disappointing finish.
034580404X|5.0|This Trilogy is the best thing that has happended to the book world. If you love to read im sure youll be disspointed that you have finished all 3 books. its bigger than an erotic novel,it has substance, lessons, and thrill. This page turner is highy reccomended as a colletible. Everyone should invest and have a copy always readily available.
B004I744AS|5.0|So far this is one of the easiest and best dictionarys i have ever used. Thank whoever for giving it freely.

B0057B8PT0|5.0|Love this album. I came brand new in its original wraping.<br />I have enjoyed listening to it before the rest of the US.
B004RQ5WUG|5.0|Don't love or hate the album based on what others say you should do.<br />Listen to the music and decide for yourself.<br /><br />Personally, I love it.  I've loved all three studio albums for their various styles; I hope Panic! continues to play around and experiment.  There will be reasons to cry if they ever succumb to critics attempts to force into a static \\"style.\\"<br />...Can't wait to see what they do next.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|Simply put, this book far exceeded my expectations. I purchased the second one immediately upon finishing the first, and have now bought even the third one.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|The story concept was weak. The author used the same descriptive words over and over again. The 'love' scenes were written so basic that it was not very exciting. Not sure why my friends told me this was a must read.
1439153663|4.0|I listened to an audio version of this book rather than read it, and I enjoyed it very much.  It was the kind of story that had me thinking of reasons to go drive somewhere so I could listen some more!<br /><br />This book took a shameful and sad time in our history and brought the often forgotten story of the slaves to the forefront.  I found the slave characters to be much more robust, believable, and, well, likable, than any of the other characters.  This story was extremely tragic in so many ways -- child molestation, drug abuse, the hopeless entrapment of the slaves as well as Lavinia, rapes, murders, drunkeness .... Yet for the most part, this story is one of the triumph of the human spirit during times of unspeakable tragedy.<br /><br />Many reviews have indicated frustration with the ending of this book. I personally thought the ending was perfect.  Frankly, I was beginning to get bored with the story about half way through .. it got a bit draggy .. but the final few chapters were quite exciting, and I found the ending to be honest, hopeful,and not the trite \\"story book\\" ending that it might have been.<br /><br />I would have given this book 5 stars, except that I found the last half of the book moved very slowly and got a little bit bogged down until the end.  And I also wish Lavinia had been written with a bit more spunk.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|So far for me a very do able game.. I have tried the harder levels but even on the 6x6 grid i have puzzles that had me stumped for a moment.. Great time filler, i recommened!
0307474259|5.0|I read the book and  began low carb eating the following day. I had tried the Atkins Diet some years ago but couldn't do the zero carbs for two weeks so gave up. If I had persevered or maybe if I had known more at the time maybe I could have achieved a lot but it was very controversial at the time. Some time later I had a lot of success with 'South Beach' but of course I returned to old habits.<br /><br />I am now convinced that low carb eating is the way to go and must be adopted as a lifestyle in order to stay slim and prevent yo yo dieting. I understand where I have gone wrong in the past and I am looking forward to having continued success. The initial weight loss was staggering -- in spite of bending the rules very slightly; milk in tea, a little low carb fruit, a glass or two of wine in the evening. But as the author says, you need to see what you can tolerate and if it has a detrimental effect then you know you can't eat or drink it.<br /><br />I feel completely liberated. I would recommend this book to everyone who has struggled with their weight. Finally, one thing I don't believe the author mentioned was the fact that when eating lots of protein as in meat, fish including the fatty stuff, even though you are not gorging, you don't actually feel hungry. Amazing.
B007RX32XK|5.0|This album is stunningly, hauntingly beautiful. I find myself in the somewhat unfamiliar position of being *that* gal... The one so excited about some band you never heard of.<br /><br />Give this album a listen. I haven't been so affected by an album in years. Who cares what the genre is... Does it even have one? The harmonic complexities tug at my soul, and each song is catchy, makes you want to move, but is also haunting and bittersweet.<br /><br />Love.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|What a great read the story flows well and the characters are unique and intersting. For such a big read the story keeps up with no dull spots and great story lines.
B0000TB03W|2.0|I bought this DVD because all of the previous reviews I read said this was one of the best of Shania Twain.  The live concert is great, but the acoustics are horrible.  I could hardly hear Shania singing.  I wish it would have had better quality, & had been sound recorded a lot better.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is extremely addictive.  Would be cool if there were different boards and levels.  It is perfect for when you are stuck waiting somewhere.
0307730697|5.0|\\"Hoorah\\" to Eric Blehm for this honest, authentic account of the life of American hero Adam Brown.<br /><br />Through brilliant, captivating writing, Blehm shares Adam's story--a story of redemption and hope.  It is the type of story that changes a reader.  It is the type of story that causes one to question and ponder how he or she is living his/her own life.  It is the type of story that can bring conversion.<br /><br />Adam admittedly didn't always lead a Christian life, but God rescued him and in doing that, Adam saved lives, but more importantly, saved souls.<br /><br />Adam was a true soldier, a tender warrior.  He leaned on Scripture and prayer for support and strength and believed God called him to help the helpless and oppressed by serving in the military and protecting and defending the weak and defenseless.<br /><br />One Easter, Adam was in the heat of battle and some men were killed.  Adam said his heart was heavy because on the morning of the Savior's resurrection he had slain men that were destined for hell.  Another soldier asked Adam how he could be a soldier and still be religious.  Adam answered: \\"One, I'm spiritual, not religious.  And two, I can't believe you can do what we do and not be.\\"  That is the theme song of the book--how one soldier followed God's calling upon his life, lived the Christian life, and in doing so gave away his life for others.<br /><br />I am thankful that this story has been told.<br />\\"Hoorah,\\" Adam Brown.<br /><br />*I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review.

0452295548|4.0|I found this book fascinating, but I couldn't read it in the way Taylor wished--starting at Chapter I. In fact she realized that many people wouldn't want to read the background information before the account of her stroke. She said that we could proceed to the account of her stroke but begged us to read the scientific information first because it would help us understand what happened to her. Well, using a term she uses, I tend to be a big picture person--don't give me all the details--cut to the chase. I like excitement. So I started at Chapter 4 which tells us of the morning she awoke to symptoms which she soon realized were red flags for the beginning of a stroke.<br /><br />Since Taylor is a brain scientist, she saw this experience in a positive way. Wow, I'm having a stroke--I'm going to learn so much from this! It seems incredible. This chapter was hands-down the most compelling chapter of the book for me--the way she described the manner in which her body gradually began to feel \\"fluid\\" rather than solid, the way she felt as though she could communicate and then the words she tried to say to get help came out, at first, like complete gibberish. Most important, the sense of peace and oneness with the universe she felt impressed me very much. You see, the stroke affected the left portion of her brain so the right portion, the feeling part, the one that feels empathy and compassion, became dominant. She had to be very careful so that she didn't just let the peaceful feelings take over and allow herself to go to sleep. She had to force herself to access what was still operational on the left side and make her phone calls.<br /><br />The rest of the book gives an account of her interactions with the medical personnel, her gradual recovery, her remarkable mother who became her caregiver after she left the hospital, and all her amazing discoveries of how she could continue to access all those good, positive right-brain feelings. She tells us in detail of how she manages to keep from letting angry, critical, and sad feelings from dominating the peaceful, joyful, compassionate feelings. She emphasized that because her brain had been right-side dominant through her stroke journey, she didn't want to lose that amazing inner peace she'd felt once the left side of her brain became operational again.<br /><br />After I came to the end of the book I returned to the first three chapters, the first gives her educational and career background, and the next two chapters give us a biology lesson on how the brain functions. It's quite interesting but, for me, I needed that compelling Chapter 4 to grab me and pull me in. If you're more of a left-brain dominant person you will probably prefer to read the book in the manner Taylor intended with the biology lesson first. I gave this four stars instead of five because a five-star book would have had more personal stories for me. For example, I enjoyed reading that when she first started walking again that she didn't have the proper gait but that this didn't embarrass her because her ego was still largely absent due to the stroke. Fascinating. All in all, an enlightening and beautiful story.
0955153077|5.0|This book is a great book for beginners, I have been doing digital painting for several years and this is a good book to start with. I wish it was around years ago. It does not tell you how to be a good artist(practice drawing) but it tells you how to use techniques that really push the digital painting which include making brushes, creating textures, using perspective, and a slew of other techniques many new artists forget. I also like that he takes his time to do step by step processes. And he writes the book like he is talking to you. Overall good book to go with.

0792163710|5.0|Last night I watched \\"Shane.\\" Boy, did that take me back. I watched it as a first-run movie in the theater and that was about 60 years ago. At the time, I thought it was the best western movie I'd ever seen. You know, it still might be the best! Well, in the old-fashioned western movies there were always the good guys (white hats) and the bad guys (black hats) and they were clearly defined. There was always a building antagonizing of the good guys by the bad and an ultimate confrontation with the good guys always prevailing. It was a standard tried-and-true formula and was done over and over again. That's exactly as it was done in \\"Shane.\\" The white hats were a group of settlers and the black hats were free-range cattlemen who were trying to drive the homesteaders out of the area with a lot of petty harassment. Shane (Alan Lad) was a drifter and ex-gunfighter who stayed with and worked for one of the homestead families (Jean Arthur, Van Heflin and Brandon De Wilde). The ultimate confrontation was a blazing gunfight between Shane and a hired gunfighter (Jack Palance) of the bad guys. Of course, Shane won.<br /><br />What sets this movie apart from the standard American Western was the quality. The story was simple and direct and easy to understand. The acting was first rate. It's the best I've ever seen for Van Heflin, and Brandon De Wild was just superb as the young boy. All other roles were quite good also, It's a believable movie and you probably will feel as if you're living it. The local was Jackson Hole, Wyoming, with the Grand Tetons as a scenic backdrop. Well, you just couldn't have a more beautiful locale and the photography was excellent. Everything about this movie was just overwhelming! First rate! Well, I guess it got six Academy Award nominations, and it earned them.<br /><br />Gary Peterson
B0026PW67W|1.0|I recently bought a book called \\"Harry Potter Film Wizardry\\" and inside the book was a marauders map, the same exact one they're selling here, even cut off a bit in the middle like this one. It is a very good quality book and good for any harry potter fan, and was 15$ less than this map. I strongly suggest you buy the book instead if you really wish to have the map.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I love the way George Martin writes. In each chapter, the story is told in the perspective of one of the protagonists in the novel, and I just love how it brings me into the shoe of the different individuals.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|love this appp, lt's great and l have found it very easy to use. l have installed on my tablet and cell.
B008N1V11U|5.0|yes, there was a shooting, which was horrible and tragic. nobody is making profit off of it, so shut up, that's no reason to be biased against the movie or this game.

0374275637|1.0|A dissenting voice. Kahneman, I'm sure, would be quick to tell you that this does not mean I am wrong. I am only 150 painful pages into this book. I am determined to finish it (I have about another 300 pages to go), but I am not sure that I will, so I write this now to explain why. I know nothing about statistics or economics beyond what any reasonable, semi-educated (I pretend to no more) would have gathered by casual observation wandering through work, a few books, and life.  That may be my problem here. I had hoped to learn something. I have not. Not yet anyway. Despite the torture of wading through these long, overdrawn, and not always very convincing examples of how we think and observe, there is very little in the book so far that has surprised me or taught me anything.  Should it have? Is this stuff really so amazing and revealing?  My answer is no, it isn't.  Why must I put up with unending references to Amos, his former, much loved, and now deceased colleague, and things like \\"a young psychologist\\" (when dropping the word \\"young \\" would change nothing), \\"my Princeton colleague\\" (when \\"Princeton\\" adds nothing, except perhaps to those who might otherwise worry that he was from, say, Nebraska), and \\"[t]he aristocratic Belgian psychologist\\" (I have no idea what I was to think after learning that he was \\"aristocratic\\" or why that made some sort of difference)? This is annoying writing.  Then there are the unending and to me unnecessary and not very informative subsets of little pieces of larger ideas, like \\"coherence seeking System 1\\" and \\"lazy System 2.\\"  The whole System 1 and System 2 construct is not doing very much for me so far. Yes, our minds do these thing, one often unconsciously and the other only with thought, and we all know this. Don't we? I will plod on and later edit this negative assessment should the book surrender a reason for doing so.<br /><br />Postcript: It was just too much nonsense to finish -- so I did not. My negative views of what I read before  trash-canning it remain the same.

B0084PB97G|1.0|Maybe it's a sign of getting \\"Old\\", but why is it every time a Classic Soul artist wants to release an \\"updated\\" newer version of their sound they have to resort to canned, programmed drums and sequences?  I've been a bassist for almost 40 years and, to my ears, there is nothing like to feeling and nuances you get when you use real flesh and blood musicians!

B000FC1HBY|4.0|I loved the first book and read it fairly quickly considering the 850+ page length.  I couldn't wait to get to book two.  However, the first few hundred pages (40% or so on Kindle), I felt that the story was dragging.  I found myself seriously considering not continuing with the book.  Then, all at once, things started to happen.  I was glad I \\"plugged through\\" and ended up enjoying the book.  One thing is for sure - there are surprises and unexpected happenings left and right in this book.  Thankfully, I am now looking forward to book three.

B003BW0CB6|5.0|There are a few contemporary mystery / suspense writers for whom the current 5-Star rating system simply doesn't apply, particularly given the current trend of `review grading inflation' that can be found on many book review blog sites.  With so many questionable 5's floating around, writers such as Daniel Silva, David Baldacci, Ken Follett, and, to me the best of all, Michael Connelly, deserve 7's, 8's and even 10's for the richness of their stories, the character depth, and the entertainment value.<br /><br />\\"The Reversal\\" by Michael Connelly is one of those.  He has been written 15 Harry Bosch mystery novels, centered on a skilled LA homicide detective, plus another 3 courthouse mysteries starring Mickey Haller, an LA criminal defense attorney.  All are outstanding and there isn't a clunk in the bunch.  Most, but not all, of the Harry Bosch stories are written in the normal 3rd person narrative style; while the Mickey Haller books are in the 1st person.  In \\"The Reversal\\" he brings both of his lead characters equally into the same story, with Bosch investigating (in 3rd person) and Haller playing prosecutor for a change (again, in the 1st person).  As usual, the story is complex and deep.  Maybe he got bored, but I get the felling Connelly is using this very complex narrative style simply because he can.  The guy is that good at his craft!<br />The story deals with a particularly nasty murderer of small children who gets his 28 year old conviction reversed on procedural grounds by an appeals court.  The LA District Attorney wants to retry him, and brings in Haller, normally a defense attorney, to prosecute the guy.  Harry Bosch is assigned to help as lead investigator.  The case is tough, and the outcome goes right down to the wire.  Like every other Bosch or Haller novel, it is a truly great, well-crafted read from a master of the genre.<br /><br />William F. Brown, author of The Undertaker,  Amongst My Enemies, and Thursday at Noon, all available of Kindle andAmazon Prime.

0470876417|5.0|First let me say, if you rated this book anything less than 4 stars, you must have been expecting a Financial Modeling Book.  This book IS NOT THAT.  However, what it does represent is bridging the gap between a  model that is represented solely in numbers, and your typical organizational flow chart.  Similar to a Value Stream Map one might see in Lean or Lean Six Sigma, the Business Model Canvas [as it is presented in the book] is presented at an even Higher Level than a typical VSM & represents the organizational components through which customer value is created and \\"flows\\", without the process stage specific numbers found on an VSM.  What need does this Business Model Canvas fill?  Long before Entrepreneurs run their Pro Forma projects, they get ideas about solving problems that a market of potential customers might have.  There's no real way for most people to see a connection between the numbers that they will run later and the customer solution idea that they have now, mostly because the idea is at best represented in a few short sentences.  And who knows if the idea was any good!?!?<br /><br />What a Business Model Canvas allows is for Business Leaders & Entrepreneurs a way to communicate that idea as a connection of business components to see if & how they form a profitable enterprise that is sustainable. Further, once notated, it can be distributed and delivered to others for general distribution of the idea  that will often lead to great detailed discussion.  Once you have done this a few times and even gone so far as to develop a few competing models for each enterprise, your \\"Architectural Decisions\\" will often bare sweeter fruit when moving on to the financial model and strategy development phases as you will have a high-level understanding of your KPIs that will go into the Financial Model and Strategic Plan respectively. This generally will lead to better execution.<br /><br />Who would want something so powerful to be simplified and delivered in beguiling form-factor of a coffee table book?  I have read this book twice and expect to read it at least 3 more times.  If you are a business coach or consultant, you better understand this book inside and out or you competition will eat your lunch.  But then again, the same could be said for most new entrepreneurs too. Finally, if you're tech startup, This is literally fast becoming mandatory business reading.<br /><br />I may sound like a FanBoy, but so what? If you only use this to communicate to all employees within your organization how the firm conducts business, you have alleviated a huge communication gap and are likely to increase successful strategy execution 2-3 fold. If you use it to develop strategy and actually innovate your business model [what this method and toolset was originally designed for], you open yourself up to a world a possibilities, especially if combined it with the Customer Development Tactics presented in The Startup Owner's Manual. I mean Stanford & Columbia are delivering courses with this, and as I understand it, PwC & Deloitte Consultants are using this method.  Resist at your own peril!

I will agree with that, but I feel in the love the story between Ana and Christian. How they changed eachother and pussed eachother and just how in love they were with eachother. It was an amazing story and was very happy to have purchased it. I'm loaning it out to friends that haven't had a chance to read it so they can fall in love with it. I have nothing bad to say about this series. Although if you don't like sexual acts, they you might not want to read this series because there are at times some graphic details of what goes on, but the love story is the best! Hope you enjoy it as much as I did!

I didn't even recognize JCVD at first.<br /><br />The quality of this action film is better than most of the stuff being pumped out these days.  Good cinematography, surprisingly good subtle performances (especially from JCVD), lots of action, bad guys, corruption, and revenge.  All the right ingredients for some good entertainment.<br /><br />I'd definitely watch this again, so yes I really liked it.<br /><br />If you're looking for some action to stream, this should fit the bill.

0345803485|3.0|I'm not sure anyone needs another review for this book, but here goes. It's not the worst book I've ever read. The characters are all generally unlikeable (specifically the main characters, the supporting cast all seems pretty normal). The writing isn't the greatest (someone needs to buy the author a thesausus so she can expand her vocab). The book itself sends a lousy message to young women that being a doormat is a great idea and if you just try hard enough you can change a man. But in all fairness, it's fiction, it's fantasy, and it's nothing anyone should take too seriously. The sex scenes are good, and plentiful, and silly. But the book is diverting and a fun, quick read, and everyone should just take it for what it is - an old fashioned romance novel with more sex and less romance. In comparing it to Twilight I have to say that Twilight is better written (which is really saying something) and has a better plot, of course. But if you just take this book for what it is and not expect more then you won't be disappointed.

0307744434|5.0|Most great books are difficult to categorize, confounding the `genre slotting' that the publishing industry loves so much. The Night Circus is a breath of fresh air, a fantasy, a mystery, a love story, an allegory with lofty themes, a fairy tale and most of all an incredibly vivid, beautifully drawn word painting.<br />Two magicians engage in a seemingly eternal contest between differing pairs of prot&eacute;g&eacute;es. The arena for this latest battle is Le Cirque des Reves or The Circus of Dreams, an ethereal place that appears out of nowhere and is open only from nightfall until dawn. The protagonists of this iteration of the contest are a boy and a girl, who know little of how it all works and nothing of how it will end, but somehow find each other. They and all the other characters are well drawn, but the most dominant character is the circus itself.<br />Much has already been written about this book, so there's no need heed to describe the story further. But The Night Circus transcends its story. When you read this book, you feel as if you've actually entered the circus, are enthralled with its colors and smells, entranced by the glow of its lights. That mood pervades until the final page. At the end, you feel like the last act of The Tempest (one of the magician's has the stage name Prospero)--as if the characters the author has created are \\"the stuff that dreams are made on.\\"<br />The best measure of a book should be: Does it stays with you long after you're read it? The Night Circus haunts and swirls in your imagination , lingering like the taste of a good wine on your tongue, long after the last page is turned. Enjoy.
0765357151|5.0|I kept saying I was going to buy it to read, and when I learned that a friend had bought it, it was the perfect opputunity to try it before I bought it. I loved this book. I will admit that I only read it because I had enjoyed the movie so much. But, of course like they always are, the book was so much better. There are always parts that they re-write to make a movie flow better, so I understand how people are irrated that the book and movie are so different. The thing is that this is a very short book anyway, so to change things to make a movie look good seems to change A LOT. But, I think the movie was still good if you separate it from the book, just wasn't an exact portrayal of the book. Anyway, this was a great book...very well written, detailed, and made easy to relate to the main character.<br /><br />As for the short stories in the back... they were just as good, loved how the uniqueness of his stories. I loved Dress of White Silk, especially the way he wrote it in the view of the child. Actually, that's is one of my favorite things about his stories.... he's writing style is very diverse and he can put himself in any characters' shoes.

0345803485|1.0|I don't usually read many romance novels, yet with all the buzz about Fifty Shades of Grey and the added urging of my colleagues, I decided to take a gamble and see what all the fuss was about. The resulting experience has left me not only infuriated but downright flabbergasted at the universal acclaim this book is receiving. This book certainly doesn't work as a romance, and as a story it's completely lacking in every key area.<br /><br />Looking back through history, it's easy to see that women haven't exactly had it very well for themselves. From being condemned as lesser beings by their male counterparts, to being perceived as instruments of pleasure, females have struggled to find a respectable identity in society, media, and politics. When referring to their role in entertainment; women have often been degraded to mere sex symbols with flat demeanors rather than having respectable representations that exude inner strength and perseverance alongside their male peers. The universal mantra: `women are weak and men are strong.' But within the last few decades, women have been recognized more as predominant counterparts to men, rather than prized possessions for their heroic endeavors; making the cliché `Damsel in Distress' gimmick slowly fade into obscurity. It's a great development for me personally since I find female protagonists to be much more interesting than generic male ones. But what does this have to do with Fifty Shades of Grey? Quite a lot in fact. Fifty Shades of Grey may be one of the biggest misogynistic pieces of literature ever produced and I'm downright dumbstruck as to why the female demographic is so enamored by it. Heck, I'm a man, and I'm insulted by this book and its portrayal of women. Even as I continued to push myself through this book for the purpose of writing this review in an honest manner, I repeatedly questioned why women enjoy the way they're being represented here. In Fifty Shades of Grey, women are portrayed as weak-willed, dim-witted, and absolutely docile to men, they're anything but strong. Again, why do women enjoy this book let alone identify with the protagonist? Do they view themselves as weak?<br /><br />The plot is so bare-bones that it's practically non-existent. Shy insecure girl meets prestigious rich boy, they get the hots for each other, and then they &@#$... a lot, in very peculiar and disturbing methods. Again, this book simply doesn't work as a romance novel. As a guilty pleasure Bodice Ripper? Maybe, but a finalist for best romance, really? There's nothing even remotely romantic going on here. The relationship between Anastasia and Christian is an entirely sexual one, there is nothing endearing or emotionally investing. Now a `good' romance novel should be perceived as a character study. Examining the various idiosyncrasies of the leads and how they complete one another through a believable and meaningful manner. Building a relationship based on doing oh-so-naughty-things is not romantic, there's more to love then just eroticism.<br /><br />But my god, the most frustrating aspect of Fifty Shades of Grey isn't its plot or its misguided attempts at showcasing human affection and tenderness. It's the characters Anastasia and Christian, I hate them! Going back to my earlier point of misogyny, the character Anastasia Steele is a literal microcosm of several of the biggest negative diatribes men make about women. (1) She completely ignores the affection from the men right in front of her nose but practically throws herself at the feet of the first rich man that enters her life. I guess money can buy happiness. (2) A man's personality and honesty aren't what women want. According to the dating handbook of Anastasia Steele, true love is made through physical appearances and nothing else. It's extremely cliché and for lack of a better word, comes off as rather whorish. (3) She has got to be the most weak-willed female character in the history of literature. She'll literally do whatever Christian Grey asks of her no matter how strange or absurd his orders are in order to please his dark desires. She needs a man to tell her what to do, and just when women were becoming more predominant as strong characters. Nope, according to Fifty Shades of Grey, women enjoy being completely submissive to the whims of men, it's revolting.<br /><br />Then there's Christian Grey. Anastasia is bad, but Christian Grey is the icing on the cake. I will literally go as far to say that Christian Grey may be the worst character I've ever seen. He's the supposed Knight on Shining Armor that sweeps the fair maiden off her feet and rides off into the sunset. Only problem is, he's not at all. Christian Grey is the kind of guy any person with common sense would avoid. The kind of person you'd expect to see locked up in a mental ward for sexual assault, not some tormented Casanova. It's already bad enough that the entire relationship between these two characters is based on sexuality rather than true love, but when they get serious it becomes downright disturbing. His secret sexual fetishes are so perverted and demeaning to women that I'm again just baffled as to why this book is revered by the female demographic. This character is a literal manifestation of the very male oppression that women have struggled to overcome through decades of abuse and diminishment. He takes your free will and forces you to do exactly what he desires; if you don't then he'll dump you faster than you can blink. What a gentleman...<br /><br />But of course anyone who has heard the publicity surrounding Fifty Shades of Grey knows the real reason this book has gotten the limelight: the sex scenes. I'm positive that this is the only reason this book has sold so well, sex sells and the success of this book proves this. The book drastically shifts from a poorly written romance novel that feels targeted towards teeny boppers and quickly becomes the script for a sleazy pornography. It barely even comesoff as erotic in the sense, one moment they're engaged in kinky foreplay; then the next Christian lets loose a quip so hilariously bad that it completely removes any sense of seriousness from the scene, it there was any to begin with.<br /><br />Fifty Shades of Grey should not be read by anyone. Where books like The Hunger Games were ten great steps forward for women, Fifty Shades of Grey is a hundred steps back. It has the absolute most sickening romance I've ever read, if I dare even call it a romance. Yet looking past all of this, it's still a terrible book in all the fundamental areas. It's very boring and padded out, the plot falls flat on its face long before it even begins. The characters are absolutely wretched, feeling more like caricatures for the worst stereotypes of both genders, and the sex scenes that permeate the book are so outrageously perverted that they can't even hope to be considered erotic. It's nothing more than a perverted fantasy.

In a friendly, reassuring tone, Kleon knocks the wind out of the doubts and fears that can often plague us \\"creatives\\".  The following examples are but a few of the pearls woven into the wings of Kleon's guardian angel of a book.<br /><br />>How or what can I create that hasn't already been created?<br /><br />\\"If we're free from the burden of trying to be completely original, we can stop trying to make something out of nothing, and we can embrace influence instead of running away from it\\".

As I see it, the operative word here is \\"start\\", begin, take action.  If you don't know what you're doing, do it anyway.  In the doing, you will become.  In the becoming, you will believe and who's to doubt you then?<br /><br />>Am I a Fraud (part 2), I don't have a clue what I'm doing?<br /><br />\\"Guess what:  None of us do.  Ask anybody doing truly creative work, and they'll tell you the truth:  They don't know where the good stuff comes from.  They just show up to do their thing.  Every day. (See \\"Make Things, Know Thyself\\"-p.28)<br /><br />>I can't figure out who I am, let alone create something.  What next?<br /><br />\\"In my experience it's in the act of making things and doing our work that we figure out who we are.\\" (See \\"Make Things, Know Thyself\\"-p.27)<br /><br />>I have too many disparate projects going on.  Is it time to cull some of them?<br /><br />\\"Keep all your passions in your life.  This something I learned from the playwright Steven Tomlinson.  Tomlinson suggests that if you love different things, keep spending time with them.  \\"Let them talk to each other.

This one is a lifeline.  To think, I'M the common element in all of my work and not just a hoarder who likes art supplies.  Gives me a whole new lease on creativity!<br /><br />>How do I keep from capsizing over negative comments about me or my work? How can I make more friends?<br /><br />\\"The best way to vanquish your enemies on the internet?  Ignore them.  The best way to make friends on the internet?

I enjoyed it so much I ended up coming onto Amazon and just purchasing my own copy so I didn't keep his away from him.<br /><br />I have been following his Slow Carb Diet plan, not entirely to the letter but pretty darn close!  I wasn't a large guy or really fat by any means but I started the plan at 182 pounds and about 20.0% body fat.  This is only my third week on the plan, today is my third cheat day, whoo hoo, and I am down to 173 pounds and 17.8% body fat.  I am not at my goal yet but I feel pretty darn good now and I know I will be there in due time.  Oh, by the way, I am following the Rapid Fat Loss portion of the book.  The book does a wonderful job of breaking it down into the sections that are most important to you right now.<br /><br />Thanks for reading my review and have a blessed day.

1451608659|5.0|This book gives an inside glimpse into the elite gymnastics training world. We all watched and loved the Magnificent 7 in the 1996 Olympic Games, and I especially admired little Dominique Moceanu. She made gymnastics look effortless and fun! Reading this book was eye opening to her demanding and rigorous childhood. Dominique's story is honest, interesting, and at times very heartbreaking. But even more importantly, her story is inspiring because she never gave up. She won an Olympic gold medal and now is a wife and mother of two. I guarantee you won't regret reading this book!! She will challenge you to reach for your goals and accomplish your dreams.
B001CGJ3QS|5.0|I only now, at age 65, have discovered Wilhelm Kempff's masterful recording of the entire Beethoven Sonata Cycle, which interestingly he recorded also when he was in his mid-60s. This is the third and final time he recorded the complete cycle. The sound quality of these Deutsche-Grammophon recordings is magnificent, the piano is wonderful and a delight to listen to in this virtuoso's capable hands.<br /><br />Kempff knows how to change moods according to Beethoven's explosive temperament. He can switch from tender sensitivity to brilliancy without breaking the continuity.<br /><br />Another nice feature of this recording is that he recorded all the repeats. These were not just copy-and-paste inserted repeats. Rather, he makes subtle changes on the repeats which illuminate the music.<br /><br />I was brought up on the Artur Schnabel recordings of the Beethoven Piano Sonatas. I was told that Schnabel played as Beethoven would have. The problem I have come to have with Schnabel's interpretations is his tendency to rush passages and blur passages with excessive rubato. I honestly don't believe Beethoven, with all his impetuosity as a composer, would have played his own music with such distortions. Kempff is much steadier in tempo, yet he achieves real heights of feeling appropriate to this great oeuvre.<br /><br />I have heard it said that Kempff's tempi were \\"slow\\". I do not find this to be the case at all. The fast-paced movements move right along at a fine clip. He has all the dexterity needed to bring off Beethoven at his most dramatic, with delicacy or bravura as the context dictates.<br /><br />Poetry combined with brilliancy, a wonderful combination and Kempff has it all.

B003TSEEDY|3.0|This was a fast and interesting read. Not the most brilliant or profound novel, but captures your interest and brings you into the narrator's world sufficiently to make you care. I felt, however, that it wrapped up a little too quickly at the end, and it seemed, in my layman's point of view, that the quality and quantity of any transition (and incidentally the quality of the protagonist's writing) in the protagonist's psyche was unrealistic given the purported time span of the letters. Nevertheless, I recommend the book for the moments of insight and emotion it manages to impart.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|One of the best Scifi movies I have seen all year. Wish Disney would make a sequel! Great world building, character development, lots of humor and a little romance. Everything a moviegoer could ask for.
1594203334|5.0|I loved this book-- it's such a refreshing change from other parenting books out there.  The book is smart and witty, and gave me ideas (that have worked) for how to improve my own mothering. I lived in France for a year, and have been back a few times since (once with my young son), and I have to say that everything in the book rang true to my experiences there.  This was a complete joy to read!
0345803485|5.0|Crikey ... I bought this for my wife and she couldn't put it down ... The perfect user-guide for females!
B008MEM24S|5.0|This game is so much fun. l absolutely. adore the voices and Perry's antics. Absolute fun for all ages. Even the harder levels make you think and are still fun to do...I cant wait for more levels to come out.<br />There is also a way to play Where's My Water<br />which is just as amusing as this game. Overall one of the best games I have purchased.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|challenging and addicting. I spent 3 hours playing this the first time I downloaded it.  really good for .improving  spatial skills.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|I knew in the feeling of my gut that this would be the best out of the others.  Although the Joker is my favorite villain, they have found a way to increase the excitement out of Bane.  Christopher Nolan did what no other filmmaker has done, which is to make a perfect trilogy.  The only reason why the Avengers made more money was because they showed it in 3D, if this film was in 3D, it would beat the Avengers hands down.  Will definitely buy the blu-ray version, hopefully there will be a collectors or limited edition like The Dark Knight's blu-ray.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I don't know if the format is okay on an actual kindle since i read it on my kindle iPhone app. The book is good though.
B007SGM084|3.0|The trilogy is just as expensive as buying each book separately. Not a deal at all. That being said, the book is like a car crash.  You can't help but keep reading it as much as you don't want to.
B008MEM24S|5.0|This game is fun!! I also wanted 2 say that where's my water isn't working and I bought it so I would like my money back if they aren't going 2 fix it.
B0045EA1P6|5.0|I originally bought this CD on one of the $2.99 sales, thinking that it might be something that I could moderately enjoy while playing it for my seven year old twins.  Well, so far I have already played it about 7 times for myself and once for my twins. Part of its appeal is that it reminds me of the era of music when rock and pop bands were actually stiving to be creative and varied in their music, espcially Queen and early ELO.  Even though Fun. follows in this vein, I must say they manage to be thoroughly original:  Has anyone ever captured the exuberance of falling in love any better?!  For a 50 year+ old man, at first I was rather embarrassed that I was humming Fun. at work all day long (this is not always the thing to do when your a therapist).  On second thought, it is just a testament to how addicting this CD is.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|If you are looking for a book to hold your attention, this is the book for you.  I could not put it down.  It kept me captivated through all three books.
B00708L34C|5.0|I have relatively eclectic tastes and an exploratory nature when it comes to music, but somehow have never heard of Mark Lanegan. I came to this page from a link on an EODM page literally thirty minutes ago, listened to two track snippets and bought it immediately. It's dark and hypnotic, eyebrows raised from the first sentence, beautifully written and orchestrated...I won't be able to stop listening to this if I try.

1455859583|4.0|The Lonely Heart Club is a cute and fun read about the awesomeness of female friendships. It's a feel good book that will have the songs of the Beatles running through your head by the end!<br /><br />When Penny Lane's (named after the song) long time friend breaks her heart, she decides to swear off boys and not date for the rest of high school. She names it The Lonely Hearts Club, a club of one, until her close friends decide to join her. When they go to the homecoming dance as each other's dates and have so much fun together with all the girls, the club quickly grows. The boys aren't too happy about it, because they can't get a date.<br /><br />The group, as expected, struggled with the no dating rule. It was fun to watch the characters deal with this... Especially when Penny may be falling for someone, despite herself and the club she created.<br /><br />I appreciated how Elizabeth Eulberg gave importance to female friendships, and how friends should support each other and build each other up. I loved that the club promoted going to couple-ish events together, and how they made Saturday nights a set meeting time. Their \\"meetings\\" were really just a way to nurture their friendships, show support, and help each other out.<br /><br />I really enjoyed Khristine Hvam as the narrator! I thought her voice fit with all the characters perfectly. She also seemed to really got into the story herself, which made it fun to listen to.<br /><br />The Lonely Hearts Club is a fun story with lessons about self-worth, moving on after your heart is broken, and not ditching your friends just because a boy comes along. I recommend this book (audio or physical copy) to all girls!
B008MEM24S|1.0|it will not let me install this game either and I want to play.it sounds fun too but my kindle fire is not letting me download it.
B008KRJWEK|5.0|it is a lot like temple run.I would give it a 5 star because<br />it's like temple run.I temple run.
B004FGMDOQ|2.0|Very unusual book. It is the type of Book you read one night and pick up the following day and become totally confused. I found the story quite disjointed. I would not purchase another book from this author
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game.. its fun and and its hard to put it down until I beat my high score
B008KRJWEK|1.0|well, it was fun the one time I could play it. I exited the game and when I went back to play again it will go to the loading screen then force close to my kindle fire launcher screen. Not cool.
B00785P2QC|4.0|it was a fun game. although you cant get enough points or money to do a lot. also it costs a lot. even though it is pretty fun.
B008MEM24S|5.0|not just me but my two year old loves this game. hours and hours of entertainment. cant wait for more and more levels!!
B003O86FMW|4.0|A co-worker told me to read the series and I wasn't expecting much but to my surprise I really got into it. This is a great series! The author did a great job! I can't wait to see the movies!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this is 1 of the best games ever!!!! I play it all the time there is nothing bad about it! its all u ever want in a fun addictive game! thank u and GET FLOW IF U WANT FUN!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|After seeing this book splashed all over television I decided I would see what all the hoop lah was about. When I first started reading I was wondering if a teenager that knows a lot of big words wrote it. As you get into it it gets better though. The last last book was my favorite. I do not normally read love stories or what ever you would call this but it was good.
B008N1V11U|5.0|I think Gameloft does a great job with their games...consistently.  A bit pricey but you get what you pay for these days for the most part.  What astounded me while reading reviews is the slaughter of the English language among the reviewers!  Some of you should stop playing games on your devices and start learning to spell and write....seriously!  It's shocking!  Buy The Dark Knight Rises.
B00884GR0W|1.0|Title says it all.  I pay for very few apps and just for this reason.  This is one of the worst.  Although it has promise it is very buggy and not close to being ready for prime time!  I had to uninstall it due to an issue when it auto upgraded.  Now I can not get it to reinstall.
B0042U94UQ|4.0|You sort of have to pull for Despicable Me regardless of whether or not you actually enjoyed the film.  Why? Well because Illumination Entertainment, the company responsible for this work, did the impossible by knocking one out of the park their first time at bat.  Founded in 2007, it's downright impressive they even managed to put out a feature length CGI film by 2010 of any quality! The feat becomes even more impressive once the quality of this one is revealed.<br /><br />Additionally the film has managed to establish itself so firmly in the world's collective psyche that not only is a sequel in the works for 2013 but also a spin-off film based on the minions for the following year.  Not bad at all for a firm with only three titles to its entire roster at present (the other two being a CG/ live action hybrid called Hop and a second full CG feature, Dr. Seuss' The Lorax).<br /><br />But enough about Illumination and their meteoric rise to legitimate competition to industry heavy hitters Pixar, DreamWorks, Sony Imageworks and Blue Sky, you are surely reading this review to learn more about the movie itself.  But before we get to that, consider Despicable Me's modest budget of $69-mil.  If that sounds like a lot to you, the average budget of a modern CG feature from the likes of some of the companies mentioned above is roughly $150-million with some even dwarfing that amount (fellow 2010 CG entry Toy Story 3 cost a staggering $200-million for example).  Obviously this makes Despicable Me's current gross of $543,113,985 even more impressive!  Okay now I'm done talking about Illumination, honest.<br /><br />Despicable Me tells the tale of a villain getting up there in years who is feeling the squeeze put on by young up and coming evil-doers like the smug & tech-crazy Vector.  So as to one up Vector and raise the bar of villainy so high that no other baddie can ever compete, antagonist/ protagonist Gru hatches a scheme straight off the pages of a comic book: He'll steal the moon!<br /><br />But to accomplish such a lofty ambition a little heist action is in order: Namely the stealing back of the shrink ray that Vector stole from Gru after he had stolen it initially.  Confused yet? No need to strain your noodle, the plot is a straight forward through and through with a wide variety of visual goodies and far reaching shades of humor to be sure to get almost anyone giggling sooner or later.<br /><br />Things get complicated for our pointy nosed, bald headed, sweater donning bad guy when his scheming requires that he adopt a trio of wide-eyed orphans.  Lending his voice to the character of Gru is none other than The Office's Steve Carell with a surprisingly convincing European accent.  The remainder of the cast is equally well selected and delivers above average vocal deliveries to compliment the solid visuals- Jason Segal as Vector, Julie Andrews as Gru's unlovable and unloving mom, and strangely appropriate Russell Brand as Gru's geriatric genius inventor Dr. Nefario.<br /><br />However, and as you might expect, an animated version of Austin Powers' Dr. Evil is hardly going to obtain the type of marketability that you'd expect from a film trying to give Disney a run for its money but don't worry, Despicable Me has that covered in earnest as well in the form of the minions.  While it's never actually made clear just what these little yellow capsules with safety goggles and overalls actually are in the film, the special features reveals that they are in fact small genetically engineered drones.  The high-pitched nearly unintelligible banter is just the icing on the cute/ marketable cake.  If additional films and theme park rides are any indication, mission accomplished.<br /><br />The soundtrack & score are spectacular as well.  Pharrell Williams provides an absolutely infectious blend of beat driven filler instrumentals and original hip-hop and R&B numbers.<br /><br />Comparisons to DreamWorks' Megamind are all but inevitable and though pretty similar from afar, the fact is Megamind is more of a spoof on comic-book clich&eacute;/ superhero vs super-villainy not unlike Pixar's The Incredibles  (just told from the bad guy's point of view).  Despicable Me is more about the business of trying to make it in the world as a villain; completely doing away with the hero element altogether.  At the risk of providing a little spoiler, this is a redemption tale at its core as well: The type where the goodness present in the human heart trumps even the sheer terror of wearing a gray turtleneck sweater with scarf and freezing everyone ahead of him into a block of ice in the line at the coffee shop.<br /><br />In all, Despicable Me falls into the territory of a resounding success in just about every unit of measurement.  The plot feels a tad bit more forced than the well-oiled machine that is Pixar (or DreamWorks of late) but for a new studio on an extremely limited budget, such complaints become increasingly insignificant.  With an exclusive partnership with Universal Films, Illumination Entertainment has made it clear that they aren't going to be content competing with anything less than the absolute upper echelon of the genre.  This, their first entry into the fold is 95-minutes well spent.  Here's hoping we're treated to that inexplicably absent back-story of the minions in either of the forthcoming films in the series.ugh pretty similar from afar, the fact is Megamind is more of a spoof on comic-book cliché/ superhero vs super-villainy not unlike Pixar's The Incredibles  (just told from the bad guy's point of view).

B000SLP4SE|5.0|Not going to say too much, I'll let the five stars speak for me. If you like those good old special ops of a loner, wrongly accused and seeking justice movies. This will hit the target.
B005HEEFH8|3.0|I love this episode (except for the excessive reactions of Mr. Styles), and the strategies of both captains as they try to outwit each other.  They are enemies but respect each other's skills.  However I dislike the changes with the special effects.<br /><br />For me, many of the remastered episodes use inappropriate computer generated views of ships, shuttles, or stellar phenomena.  Many changes don't fit in at all and detract greatly from the overall look of the show.  If they ever put out new DVDs, they would be wise to offer the option of viewing each episode with the original scenes.<br /><br />Update:  I thought to be fair I should take another look at multiple episodes to see the variety of special effects updates. It was quite interesting.  In some episodes, the changes were subtle.  The ship and other special effects were tastefully done and looked beautifully updated yet seamlessly integrated into the show. Bravo!  In other episodes it seemed the team (a different group?) took much greater liberties, e.g., shuttles that wobble, ships turning when they were not, the doomsday machine tipping over when it was destroyed (in space??). Those effects just looked out of place.<br /><br />Anyway, even if our views of the remastered shows differ, we're still all Star Trek fans.  I love this show and really respect how ahead of the times it was (previews of flip cell phones and IPads way back 40+ years ago?  Amazing stuff!!).
