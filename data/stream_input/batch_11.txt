B00PQM7PAU|5|Fit well  . Works good
B000S88HSQ|2|Did not fit. But looked good in the box.  Good construction could do better on welds.

B000ELDJ30|5|It looks good and fits well.  Easy to Install.
B0023VDYUC|4|Was delivered quickly and was a good price and very nice replacement for the original.
B000PAM9KO|1|Does not fit 2010 Acura MDX.  Wasted money and costs more to send back.
B006W2F6S6|1|looked nice but stopped working almost as soon as I received it,
B00BXPZ6V4|1|You can't rate 0 stars.  :(  Though the chain seemed to be decently made, after about a week it fell apart when taking out of my pocket, and all the parts were not recovered.  The knob/spring assembly screws together and with no locking mechanism and (at least mine) was not tightened well at assembly.  If you have one that isn't missing parts already, you might take it apart and add a drop of locktite...
B00F0BE6IQ|2|Stuck to floor of garage
B000303YI2|5|Just one expects in ''The Club.''
B004FJT242|5|Item just as described, easy install. I would recommend using a thick towel on the roof of your car to help protect the paint during install.
B00C3NA5ZM|5|Looks great in new Mustang. Perfect size and no leakage.
B001EOYIKE|1|As others have complained, the packaging is poorly done. The box came with a big rip in the side. The receiver was in the box with no padding to hold it on place.<br /><br />The primary problem I ran into is the mounting holes didn't line up properly. I followed the instruction video on the CURT website for my vehicle. I detached the rubber muffler mounts to get the muffler out of the way as instructed. I then attached the receiver to the tow loop using the U bolt. Next up was to attach the passenger side of the hitch to the frame using the bolts. This is where my problems began. The rear passenger side mounting hole would not line up without using a lot of force. The only way I was able to get this bolt inserted was to remove the U bolt. I finally got both passenger side bolts and the driver side rear bolt in place, but the hole for the driver side front bolt was far off center. No amount of readjusting the receiver would get the mounting hole to line up. I gave up at this point and undid everything.<br /><br />Maybe the receiver was damaged during shipping. It's difficult to know since the packaging is so shoddy. I imagine it would take a lot of force to bend the receiver such that the mounting holes don't line up properly. This causes me to suspect the issue is poor quality assurance or excessive/unchecked tolerances in the manufacturing process.<br /><br />I'm sending mine back for a replacement. I can only hope the second one fits.
B00849PPUO|1|It ok but it not chrome like they said it was  have order a chrome chrome mirror like shield
B00BDVHYX6|5|Perfect Fit on my 1991 325is. My pan busted so I bought this as a replacement and went it easy. No issues.
B0068C3ACO|5|Killer product to easily polish tarnished aluminum.
B002SSDUOA|5|Does a great job and it's very easy to use.  It is set at 10 degrees when first turned on, but that's closer to where you'll be timing than zero.
B00MJ7S40U|1|Cost too much to install in Headlights
B00J3D8DK4|5|Perfect fit.  Just what I needed.
B00KTHWRHI|5|Very fast shipment. Took to local locksmith to get cut & programmed for my 07' Camry.  Works great!
B00T2RC546|5|excelente...
B00IESMAOO|5|It's sooooooooo cute ( super Kawaii 😍) and she can dance to any tunes .  I love this Hello Kitty hula dancer!
B000NM2KNA|3|Works just like the original although not the quality as the original. Hope it lasts!
B00KW1ZCUK|5|Perfect Product...Priced Right.
B007WYYZFS|4|Works pretty good. Great for the price. Doesn't test capacity though, so if you need one that does you need to get a different one.
B00499YQO4|5|It fit with no problems or modifications to my 2014 Genesis coupe. Instalation took about 45 minutes. Looks and sounds great. Awesome exhaust note.
B000CNBB30|5|Just a well designed bug/rock guard that works.
B002IKWGV6|3|Nice gloves, but I would have preferred getting the gloves pictured. The pair I received have 2 loops across the end of the fingers for the purpose of removing the gloves. The pair pictured on Amazon.com have short extensions sewn onto the end of the fingers for that purpose. I hope the loops don't have a negative impact on grip or get in the way when in use or I may have to revise my review. Compare the attached photo to the actual listing before deciding on these gloves.
B00T8VG132|5|Worked great very happy with them
B00GBVHPNW|5|Nice
B004VDGIWQ|3|fits OK & looks OK made in china with very light material.  would buy better quality next time
B0000AY6XZ|4|Tracks work well, however I would like to see an attachment point in the middle of the track also.
B00BQAL016|5|Not the easiest wax to apply, but the results speak for themselves this really made my silver car's color pop. Hopefully it last as long as they claim
B00FWOKKGI|5|I can see forever with this light
B00VNJ4RQK|2|It doesn't receive some of the station's as well as the original. Even with it being broken. But I guess it's just supposed to look good
B001LHVOVK|5|Good product
B00HV2KEQ0|5|I bought the 100$ option, don't know the difference between the two options. came with all 4 spacers. took me about 8 hours myself to install. I'll also note that I've never done anything like this before, and the spring rubbers on my jeep were out of shape and didn't really want to budge. you're gonna need spring compressors. I used the outside compressor, I want to say it would be easier with the inside ones, but I made it through the whole process with the outside ones.<br /><br />couple tips for installing these items to your WJ.<br /><br />1. make sure you keep a close eye out for your brake lines while compressing your springs with the compressors.<br />2. a bottle jack worked wonders for lifting the axle up and down to get the springs in and out.<br />3.make sure you read directions carefully, I installed my front spacers on the bottom of the spring, where as it should have been on top. (I watched a video on youtube, and the dude must of had no idea).<br />4. get a ratchet wrench for your compressors, saves a lot of time, but for the most part, I couldn't really get any ratchet on the compressor because something was always in the way, but when you can get it fit in without it getting stuck, it saves a lot of time.<br />5. don't think you're lifting your axles, you're only lifting the body of your jeep. if you want your axles higher off the ground, get a suspension lift, with bigger tires.<br /><br />all in all, great price, for as long as it took myself to install, wasn't too bad, plus I had to repeat the front spacers because I installed them wrong. I drove over 80mph and didn't really have much of a wobble, but it's not 100% smooth like it was. I'd recommend getting extended sway bar links, you don't really need em, but mine make rubber squeeking noises when I hit bumps, or when I'm on trails. Would definitely recommend these.
B00ZQ32VVC|5|Fits good.
B00HEE294K|5|Product was exactly what I needed. I saved $40.00 This part will fit left and right side. One of the better purchases I made at Amazon without any problems
B009GOVCS0|5|really dresses up the Prius.
B00U27IZPS|3|Cheaply built, but serves the purpose of making my bike street legal.  I manage to bust one of my signals about every month or so, so I need some cheap replacements.  And they look decent on my vintage bike.
B00QXDBZSY|5|worked great
B004303ZGY|5|Thise mats made my new lanai. It looks like an elegant outdoor room I enjoy using. I added the fabric screens for bug control and am so comfortable.
B00E5NP21K|5|Love it..so cute and perfect in size and quality! I always get complements on it
B00DKDFVVC|5|Quick delivery.<br />Product performs as advertised
B000BH5MAA|5|This has made life so much easier!  Leveling the trailer is so simple and fast compared to trying to get it up onto the right number of blocks.  We love it.
B000OGAA1E|5|love it
B00U1WWYRY|1|Does not work with iPhone 6.
B00TUNSOMO|4|This is a nice wax that I used both on my car and on some terrazzo sinks.  Believe it or not, our stone guy recommended the use of carnuba was on the terrazo, and it made them look great.  Also gave a nice shine to my car.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B00KMYYQ5O|5|Perfect sunbrella waterproofing solution. Soak well, and repels water like new.
B000JZD7EC|5|Perfect fit. As the OEM. My car is now as new.
B00EM7S414|3|quality of product was ok not great,
B0035U5462|5|Awesome brake pads,  oem is not as good as these
B00HWI5U58|5|Made my Honda sound beautiful
B001GN1K18|5|Great
B0085FOWVK|4|Made my car way louder
B000CO7H7I|3|Eh. These are not the quality that I would like. I used them to tap into my vehicle to install a new multi-function stereo. They are hard to apply. The metal tap falls out easily. To put enough pressure on the T-tap to capture and tap the wires requires six hands and careful placement of my pliers. In the end I wished that I had bought the much more expensive taps sold at my local auto parts store.
B005A8JDG4|5|Fits good on my 2009 Honda CR-V
B00QVTC4MQ|5|Works great! Just needed a flexible socket adapter to get to the bolt.
B006B7YLX8|5|A gift for our son and of course a big hit with him! He has it installed and he loves it.
B00DCR8L9K|5|It survived being shipped from Texas to Alaska (it fared better than my Mini). It's made with great quality and durability!
B000PJED72|1|The nozzle of the spray was not securely attached. On the first attempted use of the product, which happened to be outside in a grassy area, the nozzle fell off when the top of the can was taken off the product. The nozzle fell off and could not be found in the heavy grass.
B0047M5232|5|Fits perfect. Obviously is not the same Honda quality but it works really good, you don't spend all day long using these buttons.<br />Really good product.
B007S6KU18|5|good
B00X6DEQNK|5|Great!
B000CB6DMQ|5|The MANN filter has a great fitment for my 2004 ML350. It is a much more snug fit that the filter it replaced which was about, if I had to estimate 10 thousandths too small. I actually had to press in the soft seals into the side of the airbox which is a great indicator that it won't let air pass without going first through the filter.<br /><br />Only tip is to make sure that the filter is seated properly before closing the airbox or there will be leaks in your intake.
B004P1WNBE|2|Overall this lockbox is fantastic but it doesn't fit like they say. There is a reason they say you can put it other places this box is so hard to install it took me a while to take my whole seat out and modify the underside of my seat so it could fit. Now don't get me wrong it's very well built its just the install is a problem and it was a huge problem I can't even pull me seat all the way forward now.
B00YYWO8Z8|2|Poor Quality. Had to grind around the hole in the red base so that the threaded shaft would set straight and level in the base. Also the indent on the inside of the balancing head is not precise at all. It should come to a point so that the sharp pin on the shaft can allow for an accurate balance. It does not.
B00CEIAB3M|5|Bought this set from Toyolex here on Amazon to replace the gold emblems that were on my SUV. They were genuine Lexus parts, brand new, doubled sided taped and ready to go....just as described. I couldn't be happier!
B0046QSKCO|5|This is so easy to use that I find myself putting it on all the time. I don't know if the plastic casing will prevent a determined thief from stealing my Vespa, but as the old joke goes...I don't have to run faster than the bear...I just have to run faster than you! I got the Grip-Lock in the very visible yellow and while it may not deter a professional, it probably will convince a would be joy rider or less polished thief to try their hand on someone else's bike.<br />The main advantage of the Grip-Lock is that once it's set up for your bike, it's very quick and easy to use and is a very visible deterrent. It won't prevent someone from picking the bike up and moving it, but it locks the throttle and front brake, so rolling it somewhere won't be easy.<br />Very happy with this purchase, including the quick delivery.
B0076AFCFA|3|Riding a motorcycle wearing glasses I get wind blowing in my eyes.  Oddly enough it is better without glasses but then I can't see so I was looking for something that would keep the wind out of my eyes without having to resort to a windshield.  These glasses accomplish this objective but I must comment that they could be made to seal better than they do.  That said, I am happy to have them.
B000C5H8RQ|4|I have used my boat only once sence installing the new rectifier,so far it is working fine.
B00BFDH6GW|5|This worked perfect. I watched a youtube video and replaced the broken part, all in less than 5 minutes. Looks and works great. Just be sure you still have the spring. If not just look at one of the other sellers, who unfortunately ship much slower.
B00GGSVUE0|5|A OK
B003EOJJ4W|2|Tabs did not line up well
B0094BG9SS|5|Easy to use and looks secure.
B003JAC02Y|5|Great product
B003CJ927I|4|Very pleased
B00NPIYDWU|2|I purchased a pair of these for the reverse lights on my Lexus. Though they are considerably brighter than the stock incandescent bulbs that I pulled out, they are no where near as bright as the advertised output.<br /><br />These LEDs are claimed to output 1200 lumens. That means each one of these clusters should be brighter than a conventional bulb used for low-beam headlights, which output around 900 lumens. This is so not the case. In fact, they are no brighter than a single 7W R5 CREE LED when I compared them both side by side. I would estimate the output to be closer to only 400 lumens like the LEDs I have in my kitchen.<br /><br />I currently own 3 pairs of JDM ASTAR's ultra high output LED headlights (3000 lumens each) and love them. I figured the same high level of quality and high output would translate to their other bulbs. In that respect, I am very disappointed. These bulbs are definitely not as bright as claimed and not worth the money they charge.<br /><br />On a side note. These LEDs got extremely hot after only a few minutes of operation. Very uncharacteristic for LEDs.
B00KE99AUI|4|The light is great for whatever you need. I use them for interior lights in the back of my Jeep. They're bright and easy to install. Should be good for multiple uses!
B0009H52BG|5|I wanted to be a man and change my own oil like I did in the past but felt uncomfortable getting under my sweet 2009 Lancer so this oil filter sits reminding me of the terrible decisions I've made to end up as the person I am now.
B007WWS2FY|4|Nice kit for the price.  It could use some instructions, but pretty easy to figure it out.
B00ZJJNV8K|5|I am happy with my recent purchase of the men's Milwaukee leather motorcycle gloves, I like the snug fit and keep the padding makes it feel secure.
B00R5Y2F0W|5|I like this organizer. Mostly I use it to protect the back of my passenger seat from little feet. At first I was worried about the strap crossing the lower part of the seat, but have not had any complaints from passengers regarding discomfort in sitting against the strap. It is large enough to provide adequate coverage and does not flop around.
B003876CLI|5|Good
B00L40ZQGS|1|Hardly a breeze. Don't waste your money.
B008XNWHHU|3|They dont last that long..if you forget ti close it
B003RQBKLC|5|Works great..
B000NVW1LM|5|Great stuff for old engines. Worked on a main seal leak for me. Can be sprayed on old suspension rubber bushings to revitalize them a bit. I've used it on a boat, camper van, and pickup.
B000FQ0DKQ|3|Here is another one of them &#34;Fits your Jeep&#34; items. Yes it &#34;Looks like&#34; the original. Yes, the mounting holes match up but when you go to install the plug into the socket of the light housing you realize the socket has 2 openings to receive the &#34;push in and twist fingers&#34; of the plug. The plug on my jeep had 3. The dilema? I'm tired of seeing &#34;FITS YOUR JEEP&#34; only to have to modify the new part or the &#34;original equipment&#34; on the jeep to get it to fit. Plug and play baby, PLUG AND PLAY.
B00FJIT9BO|5|Good stuff. Use it in tires and on dash. Good shine. Not too much. Last long on tires much better than aerosol spray
B00I3VXDFW|5|Great emblem and on time delivery. Highly recommended
B0009H519Y|5|Works very well. I use this to polish metal objects around the house amd the rims of my car. id recommend buying it locally.
B003ZWHMGU|4|Good price, fast ship, works fine but the size is a little smaller, just fine for me as its a work car with 150000 no need to perfect.
B00VKEVTVY|5|By far the best that I have seen for my old Jeeps
B0002Z9MZ2|1|They were not boxes that would be worth anymore than what I paid. They were not $1000.00 boxes. Very decieving
B00Y9YF2W4|5|I like it! Puts out just enough light and to much. Thanks.
B000F2RGYG|5|Nice and perfectly fit in my old corolla
B005J6JRMM|5|Excellent condition
B000AMBHG4|5|Better than in store price! works as designed, perfect fit. Thanks Amozon
B00FIZVMGI|4|Product just as advertised. Great merchant
B002JATYOC|5|Thank you
B000CJ42S0|4|Needs more screws simple fix thou.
B00480BWCI|5|Great package deal for 1st time RV. Remember to knock blocks out as bugs like to get into the bottoms some time. Very light better than wood if weight issues.
B00HLOPYKY|5|Seat belts installed easily on my Yerfdog Spiderbox buggy and are adjustable to fit small children to adults.
B000BUU5WW|5|Must have for 1st time RV. Very easy to use would recommend 2 depending on lenghth of hoses and connections. I have a 36 ft trailer and needed 2.
B005N53C9I|4|I always put covers on the eats of a new car.  This is for my Caravan front.
B00H36XX6C|5|My husband loves this thing.<br /><br />Is that enough info? He likes that it is square so it doesn't roll off things. The flashlight is blindingly bright. It is small and very portable, including for motorcycle camping adventures.<br /><br />Two things though: you need to push a button to charge, it doesn't just charge by being plugged in. Thing two is he wishes it had more charge but then it would be bigger so that would be a trade off.
B00JQTYGBU|3|Work fine. If only is deeper so that it wont rest on the pinch weld. Used it on my 2013 subaru brz.
B000BQW9FM|5|Exactly what I needed to connect schedule 40 PVC to the &#34;thin wall&#34; drain pipe in my house.  This piece fits over the thin wall pipe and is sized to fit inside a 3&#34; schedule 40 coupler, elbow, etc.
B00KW27MTI|1|The large outer ring no matter how hard you try will not fit.  The other 2 pieces fit good.
B0013LH7EM|5|Great bag, looks good on my bike !! Well constructed, arrived on time, easy to install. The only thing I did was add two small zip ties to the upper strap. Also, I really like that I could add two locks to secure the contents of my bag. RECOMMEND THIS BAG HIGHLY !!!!!!
B0014AR260|5|My husband love it.
B00LUUP3AQ|1|Was not long enough.... This is NOT the correct cable.
B00EA0ZB7I|5|Very pleased
B00NWRL2FU|5|great item ,stays on really well
B00M0TLQ66|5|Evaporust has been a must-have in my woodworking shop.  Being located in the Great Northwest, rust is a dependable companion if anything is forgotten and left outside.  Also, it comes to the rescue when a highly desirable find is sullied by rust.  Years and years ago, I found a Swiss-made Inca table saw, highly sought by model makers and such.  Bought for a song, used Evaporust to restore the rusted steel parts and sold it for 50x more than what I paid.  Unlike Naval Jelly, it is not caustic, you can get it on your skin and it won't hurt you.  No fumes (though it does have a scent).  Very safe to be around, and old solution can be flushed if it's where you have sewage treatment (perhaps not suggested for septic system).<br /><br />USE:  I generally soak things over-night, rinse them off the next day, brush of the black iron oxide, and re-soak if necessary.  REMEMBER:  the solution keeps working until it's all black, so you can re-use and re-use (sometimes refresh with a little extra water).  If you have a tub that has significant black solution at the bottom but clear/yellow at the top, drain off the top layer and save it.  I put my used stuff in a plastic milk jug until the black settles to the bottom, and then poke a hole a little above the black part and drain the good stuff into another container.<br /><br />Sometimes, a scrub with steel wool is needed to get the part clean.  Or brass wool, which is much less messy.
B006M7GZ04|3|The product is nice and works fine however, in the description it did not specify that it will not work on a 4 stroke 1 cylinder engine. Now I feel like im stuck with it. By the time I pay to ship back and pay the restocking fee, its not worth it.
B00OZSLZBG|4|Fits my 12 F150 FX4 perfectly, but a little pricey for a piece of plastic.
B00M6TX5NW|5|looks so cool, love them. takes a little effort to install, but not really hard
B000CFME2A|5|worked well
B00XORKOWU|5|These arrived just a couple days after placing my order. They were simple to install and i had no issue mounting the curved light bar onto these brackets. The matte black also looked great against my jeep. I would definitely recommend.
B004GEESB8|5|I like it fit good
B00892EW8W|5|I thought this was going to be a cheaply made item but it is nice for the price.
B008G343RE|1|the light did not  fit I will not buy know more
B00UR9ANFG|5|nice quality. wouldn't recommend for a convertible, they faded badly within 5 months
B001N72FES|5|Got it fast and it works well.
B009MQIGOA|5|I have third row seat on my 2015 X5 F15, and this was easy to put on to help reduce the amount of sun coming in to the third row seat.  Wish it comes in larger size.
B00JV59MK4|4|Color is a little off.
B000EQR87S|5|Outstanding great product solved my check engine light without any issue
B008HZK1EK|5|BOSCH, nothing else to add ....
B00BC3727S|5|Fit was the same as anyother helmet ive worn. Size was spot on. Sits lower then any dot helmet ive seen.
B000CCMLD0|5|great transaction, great product
B000CQBEAC|5|Good product.  Plenty of protection.  Obstruct the view in side mirrors because of the tinting, but I've gotten used to it and don't even notice anymore.  There were very small gaps on each leading edge against each door frame, but a dab of clear silicone caulk fixed it.  Maybe someone with stronger hands than mine wouldn't have that issue.  If any damage is ever done to them, I would buy them again.
B00TST7YHQ|3|Seems to work.  The screw holding the gauge cover in place fell out after a week but is easily replaced.
B00PUOQRK8|5|Love it. Works perfectly and easy to manage.
B00B96AK9A|5|Excellent Product
B000CN9D44|4|Worked good to eliminate noise from my front shocks used in conjunction with a crossbar eliminator on a jeep ZJ
B001CEDJLK|1|Both Amazon and the manufacturer indicate that these pads fit a 2014 Mitsubishi Outlander. They do not. I had to return them and buy Duralast through Autozone. Do not buy any rear pads for a 2014 Outlander with part number 868.
B00061NQW2|5|Excellent product, excellent service!
B00V5R21T0|5|Love it it's made of high grade materials and there are less fittings to leak plus you can pick your color and with a banks set up the red matches love the product and if your thinking I don't know what these rice burner guys would know about powerstroke you should look at their website they make good products
B0016KA9W2|1|Terrible design. After installing correctly and locking, I could just pull it all apart and remove without unlocking or using the key. WOW !!
B011IW5AVC|5|Well, I'm a teacher of young children, and big into the idea that you learn best through visuals. As a result, I use the white board, and by extension white board markers, constantly in my lessons to draw and write out stuff. A lots of the brand of markers I currently use (and buy in cheap bulk) get smushed tips and dry out very quickly. I go through about one a week.<br /><br />I'm perfectly okay paying more for quality, so I was wondering if there exists a sort of &#34;Super Class of White Board Markers&#34; that keep a firm tip for a long time, and carry a lot of dark ink. I've never tried these before, but these markers fill the bill in all ways! They're non-toxic and have a really vibrant colors! When working on a large dry erase board that is often rarely cleaned, you'd be amazed at how wide and compact they are! A great choice to buy!
B000COBK8A|5|Great easy to install
B00QBQ9S32|5|I love it
B000EDOSSI|5|Perfect for keeping the awning arm closed while traveling.
B008CFB1E4|3|Ok
B00EF3VOSU|5|Wonderful easy to put together
B0027XYKZO|5|great
B000CN5QG8|5|meets my needs
B0081SCV9G|4|good price
B00THRJZSK|5|Haven't seen it yet, but I am sure it will do the job of covering the small truck I have.
B011MWISLC|1|First of all why is it manufacturers never have a pic of my truck with their products on it. They had to design it to custom fit my truck somehow. Or was that a lie. I don't care if it's a cad drawing or a real pic put it in the ad. If I had seen how poorly this was gonna fit I would've never ordered it. These guys didn't give a crap that it didn't cover the holes in the bed rails and barely reached the tailgate. It was barely functional and looked like it was for a different truck. I had to pay $160 to ship it back to them by the time I added insurance. Then charged me a restocking fee which was not stated in anywhere. The quality of the cove seemed good but don't buy one for a 6.2 foot bed Colorado.
B00C0W8SRS|2|Came with everything I needed, instructions were pretty straightforward. Only problem is, the rear springs were way to short and inverted the shackles the wrong way causing the suspension to bind. Save your pennies and go with another company.
B004L5WLZ2|5|Very good wax, especially for a well-prepped dark color. Significant gloss enhancement. Extremely easy application with a DA and hand removal is effortless.
B003VAWP7W|3|good quality
B0041CAECM|5|Arrived as promised in a timly mannor.Product is exactly as described.
B002PQODY6|4|good replacement
B00KCQSOAA|5|Fecfect fit, easy to clean
B000E28C8G|5|filter works great, the nut on the outside makes it a real snap to replace filter
B000F34SYQ|5|Fit my 07 335i coupe perfect. It has a nice feel to it, it's not overely soft. Covers the dash and is somewhat pre molded to fit on the curved area with the gauges. All cutouts fit perfect over vents and sensor. Doesn't have a cutout for the central speaker but doesn't affect sound quality at all. Installation is easy..comes with strips of adhesice Velcro that you cut into small pieces and stick onto the dash on critical areas.
B0041PXVU6|5|Looks awesome, sounds awesome, quality craftsmanship, RSD always delivers the best in motorcycle products, you get what you pay for.
B0006MTRCY|5|DID ITS JOB
B00IT6VP6A|5|Great product, a must have for tundra owners. Makes tailgate pop. Very happy with both product and service received from this seller. A++++
B00UNTU3VO|5|This by far the best car duster I have owned.  Does not leave waxy streaks like the famous brand and removes the dust on my black SUV leaving no lint.  I hope they will eventually produce a small one for the interior - I'll be first in line to buy!  Great product!  Oops!  I see they do make a small one.  Just ordered it!
B00FXLDHJW|5|Perfect fit, easy install.
B0012ZEZ8A|5|Yes, I'm one of those guys who prefers to hand wash my car rather than run it through a drive-thru or heaven forbid subject it to one of those high school fund raiser car washes.  This kit provides everything one needs for a basic car wash.  For an upgrade, I do recommend getting a good wash mitt and grate (the grate goes in the bottom of your wash bucket and ensures abrasive debris doesn't get trapped in the wash mitt).  I am especially impressed with the quick detailer.  Between hand waxing, I have used the quick detailer to keep that new-look shine.  Spray it on, wipe it off, and the car simply gleams.  Mequiar's is a well known (maybe the most well known) brand of car care products and their quality shows in the results.  Since trying Mequiar's, I've not even thought about using any other products.
B00JMK0GIU|3|Nice but logo is painted on rather then stamped in, so it will scratch off. Other then that it is pretty nice.
B001CUNFGI|5|The item worked exaclty as described.  Very happy with the results!
B000P57HHE|5|Well made, don't leak, what else do you wanna know.
B011VEPDBO|5|This thing is so handy! I am always dropping and losing my phone in the car. I know it's dangerous to try to reach for it, so I usually have to wait until I stop the car to find it, and the worst is when it ends up under my seat. I opened this up and peeled off the sticker backing, then placed this on the inside of my car door. After I held it in place, I let it sit for a few hours to get nice and stuck. I put my phone in later, and it fit well and wasn't moving at all. I tried to pull on it a little, and it is really stuck on there. I'm glad I got this. I can store other small things in the pocket with my phone too. It makes my drive safer as well. I received this item at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.
B006DX1TOY|5|Good!!
B000NJ97C0|5|Perfect for first time RV. Holds on very well if on a bumpy road. We use a mix of hangers and these for things we don't want to fall down when traveling long distance.
B000QNBUL4|4|These shocks [KYB 565105] do look like well made heavy duty shocks, replaced the old ones with these, took the truck out for a spin<br />[ I live on a very bumpy road] I could tell the deference right away, smoother ,softer ride.
B003PI2BFG|3|I purchased this hitch for my Jetta Sportwagen and thank goodness, before installation, I found the EcoHitch and returned the Curt. While I'm sure the Curt is a great hitch and most definitely a great value, please be aware that it will lower your clearance at the rear bumper. I was unaware of this when I made my original purchase. If you want better clearance and a more versatile 2&#34; hitch option, keep looking. For me, as a one time purchase and install, I felt the EcoHitch would be a better long term investment.
B00HUSQ6RQ|5|great product looks good on 2014 corolla
B001C6IVZC|5|Easy to install and now my motor runs smoother, thanks
B000BUU5SQ|5|good splliter..
B005DO8RLM|5|As advertised. PERFECT! Thanks!
B00OA34JUA|4|Nice touch to the fenders. Looks factory installed.
B00G92F3QE|5|They were just what I was looking for!
B004PBACC6|5|Great fitment and looks great. I recommend taking off the back tires. The third mounting screw on back flaps are very difficult to tighten with the tire on. Even my short screw driver wouldn't fit. I have 18&#34; tires, standard, and the clearance is really tight.
B00RC70E7I|5|ok
B00E9BPWSG|5|As expected!
B00JGQLZJ4|5|Great product!  Great shipping!
B00IY3YLCI|3|More like 3.5 stars.  Bright lights - added under rear bumper & spliced into my reverse lights for added visibility when backing my truck up at night.  They do a good job for this - had to angle them down as they are very bright & I didn't want to take a chance on blinding anyone behind me.  I did use silicone caulk around the entire light's joints, screw holes, etc. to ensure no water would get in; no problems so far - still dry.  I do get some RF interference (esp. 105-106 MHz on radio) when I put the truck in reverse and these lights kick on.  I'll look to install ferrite chokes on the wires to see if that clears up the issue.<br />Otherwise, they work great right out of the box - not sure if I needed to silicone seal them, but the added protection against moisture seemed prudent.
B0036E9VB6|1|Dead on arrival. Does not even turn on. Waste of my time
B007AOSAM4|4|They don't fit as well as I'd hoped. The edges don't sit as flush to the floor as if like but I'm keeping them. They are certainly better than nothing.
B007I6RDW2|5|2 minutes to install.  Saved a ton over &#34;stealer&#34;ship cost.  Do it yourself and SAVE!
B00PX6DV84|4|Good
B00FTB3DZY|5|Awesome price !! Good product.
B00ATT3DOM|5|I was presently surprised at this complete package.  It contains every item that is needed to put a spare tire on a new 2015 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid.  While the car comes with an inflator and no spare, there is room for a spare under the floor of the trunk and this kit fits perfectly.  Absolute peace of mind while driving now.
B001CF43YG|5|These look good and are very much like an OEM CJ seat for my 83.  A little firm but that is good if they are going to hold up.
B005S09XUA|5|They look really good. Had to use a mallet to slide them into place. No other problems.
B00J630C9G|5|Bought these to replace the rusted Nerf bar that came with my F150. The mounts are slightly different than the original bar, but after looking at the parts I found that I could simply replace the original driver's side front mount with the new front passenger mount without needing to remove the rear driver's side mount. It saved a lot of time since I only needed to replace one bar.
B008QS9NEW|5|Yamaha Stratoliner likes this oil the very most! I have tried many, this is the recommended of course it does keep lifters the most quiet, makes the trans shift smoother, and I am sure for longevity it is the one to use. For this price, I cannot pass up.
B0064CHRYA|5|Perfect fit for my 2014 Durango.
B000CMJ1RY|4|was able to install new steering wheel with this kit
B000AUMYMM|5|Awesome and easy to use.

B000YQQZCW|5|love it
B00CJUW3HW|5|Thank you for the great window decal. It was easy to apply and looks great... not to big and not to small. We received it quickly and within the promised delivery time. Great purchase!
B002X1NLOQ|4|Works Great! I took the dealer item back and that was right at $100
B0088A6DPA|5|Fit perfectly, Abs light went out, easy to install and way cheaper than at the parts store.
B00CR1RGBG|3|Quality is poor. I would suggest buying higher quality vinyl.
B000F6TYAQ|5|Exactly as advertised. Fits perfect, easy to put on. I use it to keep the sun off my seats, dash, and steering wheel because I don't put the top up unless it is raining. Don't know how it performs in the rain not what I bought it for.
B00B7MYH8Q|4|The foam that surrounds the lenses on the inside is very low grade and will fall off soon and after the first time it gets wet, but the googles are a step up over the sun glasses.
B009EVN8G4|5|Looks great, 2013 Dodge Charger, easy install.  Cuts wind noise on highway, love these.
B000E2AMD4|5|Great price, fast shipping
B001CO6J8U|5|good original
B000C55MH4|1|These are very weak. They look much stronger than they are. these things are worth less...
B001DCNBK0|5|Best interior cleaner I ever used in my life.<br />Mothers, armor all, megiuars, none of them hold a candle to it. I've had two vehicles with black interior and they go 3-4 weeks before getting dusty. Phenomenal.
B007G3LTHW|4|Very nice, just not very big....Thank you
B00IZZDRR0|5|Great deal and product!
B00AX03E2I|5|Looks great with my Willie G Skull theme.

B00186CI14|5|good
B00473V668|5|was grest
B000E8X4JC|4|Pretty good for what it is.  Not easy install for an e39 rear set of shocks/struts.  Much better than worn out stock.
B00ULO0E0Q|3|I own a 2012 VW Turbo Beetle.  I like the emblem; however, it didn't fit on my back VW emblem.  It fit perfectly on the front VW emblem, but it was too big for the rear emblem. I would have rated it five stars had the purchase fitted properly.  Now I have one stickers that doesn't fit.  I guess I can use it as a spare for the front.
B00G0KRHK0|5|Item arrived fast! And as described!
B008BBDYKS|5|Bright. Fit perfect for visor
B008R53CTQ|5|Great Product
B000C9OPDC|5|Exact replacement item at the best price
B00RN8Y79C|3|First off I love the logo! But Lets Call it the way it is and that is a blank black license with a white sticker's that is a hand cut out for the letters and the logo<br />:( on top of that the letter/logo are not looking that good up close!<br />For the price and work man ship it is &#34;poor&#34; but I'm still going to rock it on my truck. to yoda!
B000EQ83I6|5|For as it should.
B003O0YFYA|5|Does the job for far less money than the Honda part. We installed ours a month or two ago. So far so good.  Update June 2017 - I just sold my 2002 CRV and this rear door lift support was still doing it's job just fine. No issues.
B0037NIG44|4|Fit wasn't quite as good as OEM part, but it didn't cost almost $200 either...
B000TYONCI|5|worked great
B000CAINRK|5|It fits great, color is great, and is really comfortable when worn.
B00SCXCQV8|5|They are great. Works great and looks great

B002YCE5V2|5|Yes met all my expectations !!!!
B002MGUO7Y|5|Life saver!! Was put in a wheel chair for 2 months and it enabled me to get out and around. really easy to move and set up and use.
B00CAWR9KK|3|Noted a 5 mile per gallon increase. Not that much heat reduction.
B003IOKPLO|5|Works on my diesel pickup. That is what I bought for.
B00B4KTH90|5|This product has worked very well since I installed it several months ago.  It also works at the exact same speed as the opposite side window motor.  I have no concerns with this product.
B00E0LV4GE|5|Very funny
B00B3P26N0|5|I LOVE THIS SO MUCH!!! Trust me, the reactions you get form ppl while you at a stop like is HILARIOUS!!! Especially when they are the ones with a stick figure family on their mini vans
B00XYHA21S|1|didn't send an adapter kit it was supposed  to  come with. don't stay in place. Never o
B00UHAY8FQ|5|Significant improvement to bike visibility and road illumination. Fits Stock Honda Shadow Spirit headlight just fine. Third led lights up when high beam switch is on.
B0036GGFV8|4|Good product
B00CRR5LJY|5|Perfect part. Works great. Even had useful instructions.
B004I0H86C|3|Look great , pain to install
B000WBQ4U2|5|Works very well.  Made several AC hoses with this kit.
B00EECM5FI|5|Bulbs fit great into stock 2004 Acura TL headlight assembly. Very bright white light and were a very good price.
B00UBFXSYE|2|Not original USA
B00Y85UM7O|5|Awesome sunshade for the kids at the bag. It's easy to take off when you don't need it. I have a 2013 Nissan Leaf so it's a little big for the window but it still works well.
B00JBI9G7K|5|I just received them yesterday and they look fantastic!  I was pleasantly surprised that the lights were already in them. I can't wait to put them in !!!!
B000S2VZ6S|5|Absolutely fixed my cruise control problem!  Love having a fix work the first time...and less than 1 hour to remove/install.
B000P5SKOS|5|Nice fit easy install
B000CF6RX2|5|easy install they make my truck look great
B011PHBK1E|2|Not much to say that the headline there didn't mention. Letters were not fully or cleanly cut. Tried applying anyhow, but several letters were problematic. I've applied scores of stickers like these, but never seen any of this low caliber.
B001G5Q070|5|Awesome price
B002DZJQ0A|5|These worked perfectly to adhere my EZ Pass on my car dash.
B000WPHI4O|5|well worth the money
B00WTIHMYS|5|It took one month to receive my product but we are happy with the part !
B007REFW32|5|Absolutely love it, always get compliments:)
B00TYT7CZ4|5|I purchased this 30&#34;, single row, 10w per led bar to install on my 2015 Rzr Fox XP1K. This light is awesome and has functioned great. I have other LED bars on Jeeps that are a different brand, which work good, but this one puts out much more usable light! I purchased mine through a different vendor and didn't pay as much as it is listed here, but even at this price it is definitely worth is! We did some night wheeling on Chinaman Gulch in Colorado, and this bar made the trail look like we were driving it during the day!
B000H0RDB2|5|perfect
B006TMLTXK|5|good
B00HYJFWYE|5|Perfect fit... and is working great. The wires were a little shorter than the OEM, but all in all great.
B00B758AO0|1|I bought one of these in July last year.  I put it on my tent trailer shortly after it got here.  I parked the trailer in the open, expecting that it would protect my investment.  I went to pick up the trailer last month and the cover had completely sun-rotted from end to end.  I would have done as well if I had just scotch taped the 89 one dollar bills to the trailer and let them sun-rot.  I was forced to give this pile of rags a star rating so I gave it a one-star, but I didn't mean it.
B001IH8Q0A|4|Fits as it should.  Converts Class II 1.25 inch receiver to a full 2 inch receiver.  Be advised that the hitch pin on the smaller side is a smaller diameter than the one on the 2 inch so you may want to find a locking pin for it.  I don't tow with it, I just use it to haul a cargo carrier.  I bolted the small side with a lock washer and performed fine for a 1,000 miles.<br /><br />My only complaint is that it is a little long.  The 2 inch side could be offered in different sizes, but each application is going to be different.
B008E66VSC|5|Item as described, arrived quickly.  Easy to put on my jeep before the husband noticed I bumped the fence and broke the original one. Thanks for a great product and swift delivery!  :)
B005EMK03G|4|I bought this to keep my car clean, but it doesn't stay flat like the picture shows. I had to find a way to strap it down so my son's feet wouldn't get stuck on there. However, it the pockets are big and perfect for road trips, as it can hold their toys, snacks, etc. I just wish it came with a bottom strap as well.
B00YV4HXKG|5|Used these keys on my ford mustang 2007 and they work great. I took the keys to my local locksmith and had to disassemble the key and took out the metal key part because the remote itself is too big to fit in the key copying machine. If you wanna know how to disassemble this key, youtube &#34;How to open Volkswagon Key.&#34; Its the same thing. Very easy. Programming the remote and key was easy too. Just youtube your car or read your car manual.
B003SZ8YSY|5|popped right in. no isssues
B0007YZB5S|4|A little tricky to figure out how to wire it. If your using LEDS you will actually need a four prong relay, not a three prong.<br /><br />Unit seems sturdy and works when properly wired.
B001OD0VPG|5|good clamp.  Good grip and contact.
B0041FG2K2|5|High priced
B00EKS5FJO|3|I will say this is ok. at least it really makes the plastip melt. But still it requires a lot of effort. so ...Don't plastidip anymore...it really brings a lot of headache.
B00IKPP9ZS|5|It works!
B00M0CBV9U|5|We bought the &#34;RoofBag Cross Country 100% Waterproof Soft Car Top Carrier&#34; in the 15 ft size along with a &#34;Sherpak SuperMat Roof Mat&#34; for use on a 2015 Toyota Sienna with side bar racks and a trip from New Jersey to Hilton Head Island, South Carolina with six people and it worked out great.<br /><br />The RoofBag easily handled our 5 large duffle bags, 4 tote bags and a few blankets and beach towels.  Had we needed it we could have fit a few more items in the bag.  The material is thick, and the rain flap and heavy duty rubberized zipper held everything in place just fine.  The straps are very well made, and while I was concerned about the plastic clips, they held up throughout the trip.<br /><br />We did not encounter any rain during our trip, but it rained a lot in the evenings while we were on the island.  I removed the RoofBag upon arrival and made sure that I had a dry place to set it up again when we left.<br /><br />We bought the &#34;Sherpak SuperMat&#34; to protect our rented Sienna and that worked out perfectly as well.<br /><br />At 80 MPH we did hear some noise but a few re-adjustments of the straps and a higher volume on the radio helped us ignore it.<br /><br />On the drive down we saw a surprisingly high number of soft roof-top bags.  Out of all of them the RoofBag seemed to held its shape the best and looked pretty good on the car (except for the big goofy logo on the back).<br /><br />Overall I would highly recommend this product.  We will certainly get many more trips out of it making the ~$150 investment with the mat well worth the price.
B000OR18BE|5|Great deal! We often take friends who don't always understand that water can't run like at home. Tanks get full quickly and this will be a huge help. Quality construction and materials. Just need a way to attach accessories so that they stay with the cart. Still completely satisfied.
B0012Q4IPY|5|Installed in my 2003 4Runner 4WD V8 and works as expected. At 115k, my original plugs actually looked pretty good. This was a fantastic replacement and will likely last just as long. Purchased with the Permatex anti-seize lube and installed as recommended. Checked & inspected gaps which were perfect at factory specs. Highly recommend.
B000ARTZPO|4|People that I supply they are given testimony on it.
B001AGOUX6|5|Clamps work great!
B002IVEOR4|5|good construction better plastic
B00027H32Y|5|PERFECT!!! Nice quality and cheaper then oem
B000PKZ8SE|5|Great price. Delivered on time
B002CN2M5Y|4|it works pretty good on my car.
B00B2AU7QE|1|The first month ot was great but the line is made out of cloth and it rotted and broke..this sucks because now I have to go spend money on line replacement
B000X90YUO|5|Great heavy duty portable compressor.  Use for trips to the beach where tire pressure is lowered to drive in sand.  This is a truly heavy duty little compressor.  Not the cheap plastic - take and hour to put 15lbs in a truck tire.  This compressor works as well as my little Porter Cable pancake.  Am considering mounting it under the hood so it's always available.  Keep it in the truck all the time just in case. Watch out in the summer time, it gets warm when airing up all 4 tires. I added another coiled air hose so it can reach the rear tires easily.  The included hose is marginal and barely reaches the back tires.  If planning on airing trailer tires might want to add a 50' soft hose.
B0012TZ1RU|5|The best chain lube. Just  be sure to wait awhile after spraying on chain. Good stuff.
B000SOFE86|5|Good look.
B002E5DT2A|5|Shipped fast, perfect fit/function, item as described. A++
B00HK3UCIK|5|I used this on a 2015 RZR XP1000 with a ProArmor steering wheel.  Price was better than some SxS vendors.  Quick release works great, need to order the locking cover.
B007O5GWSS|3|so far, it's very good
B004AHQ4J0|5|Went right in as expected.
B00HFWZ1NW|5|Really nice
B00IFPFDDQ|5|Exactly as described! Prompt delivery!
B00DQ1RV70|5|The Prius is good to GO.
B0110CO95S|5|Worked as advertised
B007ZDFRDK|5|Perfect,Everything was great
B0006308YY|1|this pipe is junk, don't waste your money, in 6 months it was more rust than chrome
B002PZA2UG|4|Love the wash dry combo... Can put clothes in the washer before work and come home to dry clothes. Does not ruble just spins so the sleeves of long sleeved shirts get twisted and wrinkled... Not for really nice clothes but for my construction work clothes it will work just fine.
B00AE4U6T2|5|great I can find my purse!
B00MASS6EW|5|on my  laptop right now!  Love it
B000ARPVOI|5|I have been using this product for the last two years and I have been skeptical about it since my dad told me about it. I always just pour it in when the tank is super low and when I am at the pump after every oil change(4500 miles). Recently I stopped putting it in since the start of this year (2015). Recently I noticed I got about 225-250 mpg out of my tank  when I should be getting around 300. I decided to go buy a small bottle of this like I used to, and now I am back at 300. So this does a major difference. If you buy this, make sure you get the small version too so you can just refill. I bought the small one at walmart for 3 bucks, and then bought this big one to refill it so I know the exact measurements and convenience.<br /><br />Pros: It works, I went from 225-250 back to around 300 miles out of the tank.<br />Simple to use<br /><br />Cons: They need a barrel version so I can get it<br /><br />How to use: I say do it after/before an oil change. I do mine at every 4500 so I pour mine in. Before pouring in, make sure you get your tank to the lowest as possible. I drive doing what I do everyday till my gas lights come on, then pour it in right before I fill the tank back up.
B007O34AOS|4|I had problems with tabs not fitting and needed to use a hair dryer to heat up the plastic in order to bend them into the proper position in order to get this grille to fit. After my best efforts there's still a few small gaps here and there. The black plastic color doesn't exactly match the lower grille or the fog covers (all bought from the same seller) so if you're a bit OCD you may need to factor in the cost of plastidipping or painting it. Having said that, I expected to run into some of these problems with an aftermarket grille and overall it's a very good product for the price, especially compared to the OEM grille.
B0002RNSLO|5|Very heavy duty piece of hardware for towing. I have a spare that I purchased from a local hardware store and the quality doesn't match this one.
B00HY046R2|5|Great product!
B000CCDNU0|5|Great sound but get installed by professionals
B00A6TXQOW|5|I love this keychain. Quick shipping too.
B00MWT133A|5|Works great on my 99 Z3 and 06 325i
B003V57NUQ|4|Very good for the price.
B006OQJLD6|5|The price was right for this outdoor rug!  We did not want to spend lots of money to hide the old concrete in our patio, so this rug fit the bill!  It has been down most of the summer, and seems to be holding up well under the weather conditions we have here in Ohio.
B000EQU06O|1|Defective  part I was unable to return it
B004GCCN3A|5|Exactly as I expected!
B00DH2YGDK|5|LOVE this! I bought this one since it is white and will not fade.  It's the perfect size!
B00551DZ3S|5|Great rack, good price, fast delivery, easy to assembly
B006WFU912|5|I put a race motor in my 2008 HD Road Glide (120R) and didn't want to break a belt, so I converted to a chain drive. I read review after review, and chose the best. After 100 or so drag starts, and around 3000 miles later the chain is in great shape. I am sure glad I went with the chain that got the best reviews.
B0054HNQ32|5|Work well.  Fit is good in the etrack plates.
B009OBVXDO|4|I tried this polishing compound after attempting to remove deep key marks with their compound power pack. I had better success using the Ultimate Paste Wax Kit.
B005DLNWKG|1|Apparently I didn't read the description well enough. Can't use decals - just magnetic signs.
B005ETKKKM|1|Product was wrong! Tried to use web site for help, but that was a joke, Couldn't even get a responce.
B000X1YUZC|5|Great straps.
B00BTLEIIY|5|Good
B002NZWGWK|5|Simple to attach to the Prius. We used it to haul 2 bicycles without a problem.
B00MC6RQAM|5|Super bright, great purchase for my 2009 Mitsubishi Lancer. Light up the night for sure.
B00C7YFIJK|4|Not the best fit, there's a bit of a gap at the top and it clips in so tightly I doubt I'll ever be able to take them out without breaking them (hope I never need to use my tow hook). Having said that, you can't beat the price and they have a great finish for reproduction parts.
B00BCH4PLA|3|Does not spray well without a very strong pressure washer.
B00HJ6O4A0|5|Pretty colors and folds into a tidy bundle for storage.
B00KTI9UQ8|5|Perfect
B005KOZ25Y|5|2005 f150, works great on my truck, heckuva value
B004PQHTIG|5|Good stuff
B000N2TK3I|3|this looks good but does'nt have enough 3m tape to hold product to vehicle.
B000B6AF80|5|Worked great. Looks great. Like others said, use a better brush. Have enough left to do a 2nd vehicle.
B00NJRGD70|1|Too small for 2000 Ford Expedition and 2008 Pontiac Torrent. Needs to be just a little bit larger.
B00KSO8J42|2|I have a streetglide 2014 and I removed the mirrors. To close the holes I bought this. The small one was fit in the small hole but the big one did not and its smaller than the big hole
B0057OV5MG|3|Far from me OE
B007ZFNNRA|5|Excellent product and fast shipping as expected from Mechanix... My 9th or 10th pair that I use for riding my motorcycle. One pair lasted 7 years....
B00MJMYXIM|4|fit perfectly on my vstar 650 east to install.
B000AMGYLC|5|I liked this packaging of Rain-X.  It made application much easier - I wish they would consider re-releasing it.
B000CQ4BAW|5|works as expected

B00M9IBP00|5|Best bang for your buck.
B000BKJDKM|5|excellent product and price
B00DN84REQ|2|This doesnt work well with Kensun Kits and 2001 E39.. i had to cut parts of this adapter and had to get creative in order to make it fit... not worth the money and time. Dont buy if you dont want to spend more time than necessary.
B001O07P9E|5|Works great and fits great!
B00521T8UU|5|Good
B00JKUJ6MO|5|Perfect. ...

B00ZZRPU7G|5|I'm  very  happy  with  my  car  seat  cover  I  would  buy  them  again  in  different  colour  was  very  happy  thank  you
B007V1U4B6|5|Arrived on time, good price and the truck is running..couldn't ask for more and when my husband called to ask a question the tec sent by email a picture of explanation👍
B00192QB3I|5|Exactly what I needed, heavy duty and durable.
B00877SL2M|5|these bulbs work good and really bright. thanks
B001JT1FJ6|5|Whenever I run this in my cummins it quiets down and gets better fuel mileage.
B00GKMP9A8|4|Actually bought to use to open my skylights, which are have a hook 1 foot in but are at only shoulder height.  Work great for that, although I wish the hook was a little more curved as with the current design it can slip off the eye relatively easily if you aren't pulling back enough.
B003C01FD6|5|excellent value
B0021JOKIG|5|Buy it!
B004U8JH84|2|When attempting to return the product the Super Store returned my return. Due to cost it was no longer worth the cost. Very disappointing.
B011RZ1IA2|5|Thx!
B00PP66AVC|5|not all that stretchy, but the carabiner ends are wonderful: no more tangled bungees!
B006ZZSG2I|5|Great Stands, Very sturdy and strong. Ive used the triple tree stand on a couple liter bikes and a few cruisers. Essential for fork removal and both are great for tire, brake and chain replacements. Comes in handy for all maintenance really!  I even use them for winter time storage to keep the tires from possibly getting flat spots. Fully adjustable for different height bikes. Must have swing arm sliders to use the rear lift. The wheels are made of a hard plastic, great if your garage from is coated you can slide them around while under the bike.
B0036YSJCI|5|The Best Money I've ever spent...Love this Heat Shield...Works Great...
B008G3795W|5|Arrived neatly packaged, in a timely manner, and fit. Which is exactly what I wanted.
B00CJD10TQ|5|Worked great
B002R1N6GU|4|Woks great. Looks and fit just like the original. No regrets so far.
B00F9LPJ8S|5|awsome
B00VNBEBCS|4|I have these lights, but the LED plate is at a 45° angle on my 2012 Wrangler. This causes one side of the the plate to reflect higher than the other side. I now have a mucher higher beam on the driver side than on the passenger side. How can I solve this. I have aimed the headlights as much as possible, so I think. Please help me, the lights are beautiful and I would like to get them working right. Side note, my high beams are even as can be.
B00280Q5UO|5|This made the installation of my MSD6AL super easy!! Thanks for having this available.
B000BPSW7C|4|Seems to be good stuff, leaves a very nice polish feel to the car, and is WAY easier to wipe off than wax based products.  I don't know how well this lasts compared to those products though...it does say &#34;once a year&#34; so I guess I can assume it will last as long.  The wax based products do feel a bit better though, but I don't know if that means they are superior.  I'll probably keep using this stuff simply because it is so much easier to apply and wipe off.
B001GMX3GE|5|12,000 lbs. Badlands winch.  Good fit and plenty shout.
B00W25YZVG|5|Work great
B0007XB48C|3|price for the quality
B004TLGWS0|5|One of my favorite RV covers. The material is nice and durable especially for the price. Putting it on and taking it off is simple and it withstands weather pretty well. Lightweight and durable material is perfect for my RV usage.
B001GH5PX8|5|very good item good price too
B00BT8XWUM|4|These really impressed me. they fit good and are nice to look at. the yamaha radian they are going on is just about ready to ride. my friend who owns the bike only paid $100.00 for it. I would have checked 5 stars but we haven't ran it yet with them installed. once we run the bike I'll see if I can edit this review.
B000X25LM2|5|Fit perfect good choice
B0002L6FKQ|5|Fits perfectly
B00DSD5AEW|5|It is as advetised; an R2-D2 sticker. Considering some of the things I have purchased from Amazon, merting the description is an accomplishment.
B001UCB196|5|excellent product, Thank you
B00O3QARHS|5|Good quality. Very clean and vibrant. Real carbon fiber. Loved it.
B000EQRUFI|4|good item good service
B00BQ4328Q|5|Better than I expected.
B001JE4CIW|5|Perfect fit. Cleared up my ABS/Traction light issues.
B0070Y35OC|5|Great price and great film, thank you
B00CSX42WY|4|This was just what I needed.
B0122TBC9E|1|Plugged it into my 96 f150,  nothing!  It won't scan it at all!  Won't let me give it a half star for appearance alone.
B00HJ6O4A0|5|Beautiful colors and big.
B005DLLVWC|5|Perfect
B0014DINF6|5|This test light is solid and has a very good cord and clamp.
B003SOJV3C|5|Purchased this to cure the following error code on my 2003 Land Rover Discovery:<br /><br />P0441 Code Evaporative Emission System Incorrect Purge Flow<br /><br />This is an exact fit and roughly $40 cheaper than what the dealer wanted to charge me. It took me about 20 minutes to disconnect the old one and install this new one after reading a quick tutorial in a popular Land Rover forum.<br /><br />I've had this part in for almost six months now and the code hasn't come back.
B000F1Q9UY|5|Nothing fancy. High quality bolts that won't break under extreme forces. Cheaper than pricing then individually at hardware store.
B001JT1CEE|2|ok but very very thin and high gauge
B00VO63XIK|5|Excellent! Thanks for wonderful service!
B00T4TEWBQ|5|Great bag. Love the removable lining!!
B000AY68SO|5|Arrived sooner than expected and is exactly what was portrayed in the shop. I love it!
B00I4D6NS8|5|nice fit
B00H4058H4|4|Very good
B000182EUK|5|excellent fit - 5 minute install - great product
B00T6MKE2W|5|I suspect that  these were for a regular sentra. ( non ser) I got it figured out and after installing  have no problems so far. Next time i will be a little more careful on fit.
B00A82CF6M|4|It worked in a pinch with some modifications to the scooter. It's certainly NOT a direct replacement by any means, but the battery itself isn't to blame for that.
B002R1097O|5|Easy to install and made the front look new again.
B004JW66H6|4|Got this for my daughters guitar case.  Very cute and easy to spot her case from across any music room.
B000RFT9YG|5|works great
B00AHJZBCG|5|Not the zillion candle power as some of the others but this weighs a pound and a half. Not twelve pounds like some of the others. The light i bright enough unless you want to be seen from outer space. I use it for spotting buoy markers when approaching the marina, then for added light when entering the slip. It has a dimming button which is convenient for close up light. The LEDs are not hot like Halogen and do not burn or break. Iy is pricey but if you read the reviews about half the people who buy the cheaper ones have problems, and the rest most likely will. This is a Stanley product, a company with a long time reputation for quality products. No others in this class had a 4-1/2 star rating.
B00EJFH6YA|5|First time buying a led bar light. Very good construction out of the box. Size fitted great. True in dimensions and name brand on housing. Tested it when it was received. I really like the mounting of the brackets which suited what I wanted to do. The light is very bright and has worked flawlessly. Amazing how much light this puts out. I would buy this brand again if I decide to purchase another led light bar.
B000CITK8S|4|i really love the battery tender. i wanted to use it to charge my batteries but upon receiving i realize the voltage is 120 instead of 240 v.<br />I bought the product to use in Ghana west Africa. Our current in Ghana is 220v.
B000C0UMNS|5|Exactly what it says it was and worked as well as it needed to.
B000CPI5ZK|5|Great stuff. Perfect for Cadillac.
B007ND4P0S|1|They didn't last but 2 weeks.  1st one went out completely, the 2nd one is flickering.  checked connections and everything is solid.  fault is in the lamp itself.<br />Bottom line: not going to buy these again.  Will look for something significantly more reliable
B00M3NEBMK|5|Awesome quality and love the fitted design. Super fast shipping too, received my package within 3 days of paying for my order. A+++
B0050VGZLM|1|This Product just doesn't work!
B00XEH89EK|1|What a pain this camera is. I purchased it. Used it. Then realized I needed a not included micro SD card. Went and purchased that. Recorded a video, got home and plugged it in with the supplied USB cable. Cannot get my videos off of this thing. Read more and now realize I need to go back to the store and buy a micro HDMI cable? Really. INCUDE this stuff. I am returning this and you can have your product back. SENA, you include too much stuff for your products for various fitting applications, but you do not include the essentials. Absolute waste of my time. I'll send this back to you and you can repackage this for someone else. Thanks.
B000BRF2L4|5|I only used the receiver part since the screw holes didn't line up on my RV.<br />The receiver part works well and I used that with the existing shank.
B00AQJZ2OO|5|worked like advertised
B010156W5A|5|Good product!!!!!!!
B00AZPI0NE|4|Very good deal for the price. I bought this aux light for my honda falcon NX4, which comes with a standard set of lights, which is ok for the city, but not that good for the open roads I drive in Costa Rica. So I have been testing it for a couple of months now and it really makes a difference to support the low beams. It gives you a very good short distance illumination scope. I wouldn't use it for long distance scope, you might need a different configuration. Any way! Good product for what I need. I'm adding a couple of pics so you can see them installed.
B001MOVK9S|5|Did great! Keep it in stock :)
B001GF3ABO|5|came nearly packaged in a box. I took to it to the local muffler shop and it took about 15 minutes. A little louder than I wanted but sounds great. Has a &#34;healthy&#34; sound to it.
B00GGM9CLO|2|They look nice but they do not stick well
B00FXAI05Y|5|looks good , nice add-on
B00BRL73Z6|5|Excellent product!!
B004KED6XA|4|Bought this to flare the exhaust on my 1977 Triumph Bonneville. As some may know, the exhaust on these bikes really just sits in the head with no real way to snug it up. So, if it doesn't fit tight you get a ugly leak that gets worse with time. This did the trick. A little muscle and a lot of patience and this expanded my pipe beautifully. Fits like a glove and no more exhaust leak.
B002UC4TEO|5|Good price, fast shipping, OEM fit and quality.
B00K33GN2S|1|Sprang a leak after 6 months. I tried emailing the vendor, but no response. Very disappointed. Don't take a chance on this item... it is not worth the time you will lose replacing it again.ecause I can fix it without removing the radiator.<br /><br />As others have mentioned, the bolt holes for the fan shroud do not line up perfectly. A dremel tool and a drill bit took care of that problem, however. I had to cut out a small gap on the top of the shroud so it would go around the return hose. That allowed the top shroud holes to line up correctly. A drill was used to ream out the bottom holes a little so they would then line up. Took 5 minutes and it went together fine.<br /><br />I went to the hardware store and bought some M6 flange bolts and washers to replace the old, rusty ones that were OEM. (My Jeep is 15 years old, so it was about time). I used some anti-sieze and had no problems feeding into the old thread clips. Be sure if you do this- do NOT get the mini-head bolts. You want the regular M6x20 bolts, and get oversized washers to go with them. You will need the big (1\\") washers because the flange holes are so large on the radiator... plus you're going to ream out your fan shroud a little too.<br /><br />Be sure not to attach the fan shroud before you attach the radiator to the frame. You will need to move the shroud around to get your socket wrench to those 6 bolts...especially the lower ones. I found that using a 4\\" socket extension and laying under the Jeep was the best way to get to those hard to reach bolts.<br /><br />This radiator comes with a cap, so you won't need one from your hardware store. Also, I only needed 2 gallons of 50/50 to fill the thing. Coolant capacity for a 2001 TJ (4.0L) is 2.6 gallons. Also, the drain plug is not one of those 90 degree rotating stop cocks. Those are awful because after several cycles of heating and cooling, you get drips and eventually a full on leak from around the seal. This radiator's drain plug was a screw in plastic plug with an o-ring. I am going to buy a metal plug and use some aluminum anti-seize on it down the road... but for now I think this one will be just fine.<br /><br />That's it! I noticed a huge difference in cooling my Jeep after driving to work. Normally my engine is popping and creaking after shutting it down because it would get pretty hot. Today, I drove it to work and checked the radiator... I actually touched the aluminum and did not get burned. Holy cow. Also, no drips. So I guess that's what a car is supposed to do? It's been a long time.<br /><br />One last thing. I placed the order on a Friday and received it the following Thursday. FedEx says it originated in California. I'm very happy.
B000K0R70Q|5|Color says red, but they were black.  Very heavy duty, should last a long time.  No issues.  They installed fine on my 2012 JK Wrangler
B0040CRTK8|1|Did not match original and is also a 1 time use. Just like the original. Once you clip it in it doesn't come back out without breaking.
B00757BYUG|4|Bought these to replace hazed and cracked headlights;  Ok product; Installed fine; however, despite being &#34;OEM&#34;, the plastic is notably thinner/lighter weight than original lights.<br />Lights were installed correctly but have small gap along bottom of lights.  Fixed with some clear silicone.  Light bulbs work great.  All in all not a bad purchase; time will tell.  Car looks new.
B000BQKBP2|5|Makes it simple to connect a garden style hose to get rid of your grey water. Don't try to use this for black water, as your turds will not fit through the hole.
B002MGSNNQ|4|Works as it should, I have a camper and another ac on it.very pleased with the rugged construction
B00L2M73TQ|4|Everything fit right and it even came with gaskets and bolts for other parts that I guess tend to break upon removal. Those extra pieces saved me a few trips to the parts store. 4 stars because no instructions or parts list
B00TYF1KAQ|5|Works great
B004I1F0ZC|5|Tanks my car is like new ....
B00EP9BUVA|5|Easy installation and awesome results
B004R388JG|1|Product came with a broken weld. Fit terribly, rattled around in my hitch...Even if it hadn't been broken I don't think I'd put my bike on it....was an overall disappointment.
B0034ZL3I6|3|Install was relatively easy. Listen to everyone else, it's a pain to get in one of the screws. I didn't have to cut down an allen wrench but if I had it would have been much easier. Some parts are plastic. Also they went very sloppy with finishing the product after chroming it. Bolt holes were filled in with excess chrome...had to be re-drilled out. Some metal parts had been nicked or dropped and they never touched it up with a file or anything, just tossed it in to be chromed. They could have also dressed up the bolt heads some. The price was better than Harley stuff obviously but I still don't see why it cost as much as it did. Still, it does its job and looks pretty good.
B00DDQ194Y|5|Looking great..
B002L3H5YI|5|well built, kind of heavy.  Hasn't faded in a few month's that I have had it.  It is the CUBS!!!  Got to be good  right?
B00BFDJCPA|5|Fit perfectly.
B007L58MTS|5|It the right solenoid but the connector is not , I did install it it started but no fuel deliver to the carburetor.
B0009H51SU|5|great
B00KLKTL0E|5|Fast shipping, products exactly as described.
B000WHACHC|5|Well satisfied, great buy
B003CJ927I|3|Ok
B003VARGVM|5|meets my needs
B00MSAOUF6|5|Love
B0066CP998|2|Does not put out heat.  I should have found one that would put out more heat.
B00QW5796U|1|This does fit my 2008 frontier,it's a bit short.
B00DGRR6DI|2|It's  remanufactured from the original. I purchased a pair and after driving for a week, the caliper pins came loose on one side. The guy at the autoshop said that it must have been a bad caliper pin
B000CO7NGI|1|The bulb probably works fine, but I would not know since it was not the correct one to fit my bike. A 1999 Honda VFR800. Said it was guaranteed to fit, but the little tabs were in the wrong place to fit my bike.
B0000AYFTH|5|Product is good. Package was open and crushed.
B009ABUGRW|5|Nice and comes oiled
B000C9GO8G|1|Ordered this part since Amazon said it would fit my vehicle, it did not! The part took over 2 weeks to get and it was not ACDelco which it says in the description.  Kicked codes on my truck and had to put the old one back in. Make sure its the right one and its ACDelco which it was clearly not!
B000EQLCU2|5|I cant say enough about this header, it fit with NO modifications on my 96 Jeep Cherokee XJ and sounds great. The welds look great this is a quality product at a cheap rate compared to other companies. This is my second ATP header I have one on my 98 XJ as well and have for at least two years now with no problems. Don't cheap out and buy the cheap EBAY header for $110 its junk just ask me how I know........
B00407RTMG|5|Great product. Fast shipping. Thank You.
B001QR1TZG|5|Good quality and easy install.
B0007N5758|5|great brush
B006WONLM2|5|My turn signal / High-beam wand was misbehaving so I replaced it with this one.<br /><br />I watched a video on YouTube on how to do it and 10 minutes later, it was installed and working nicely.<br /><br />This part cost half the dealer cost and installs so easy.<br />Definitely try this yourself and don't let the dealers rip you off.
B004ZF3Y40|5|i will bayed  again
B004I14N7I|5|It was perfect!
B003K2EQT6|1|Bought these as they said they fit my 2009 civic si, upon install they do not fit the front brakes as they state.
B0054T95ZS|4|Bought these because the old ones on my Jeep Cherokee was falling apart, and I needed something easier to hook a wiring harness to. Installation was simple for me, cut the old wires with wire cutters (easier than expected) then carefully combined the wires (two for positive, two for negative) into each of these terminals and re-installed. I only gave 4 stars because these could be a little larger/higher quality, but I fully expect them to last for at least 5-10 years. I was surprised how much battery cable could fit in here, just tightened the bolts down really tight and everything is snug.
B00TPV9OYS|4|Works fine. Satisfied!
B000FQ95IC|4|you have to go get longer bolts, otherwise great product
B005535AMK|5|Fits as described. Excellent on my 2001 Corolla
B0009IQXCM|5|Exactly what my friend wanted.
B00IJ4T7DK|5|Very happy with the bracket,I didn't want to drill any holes and it holds my cobra 29 out of the way I may even order another one for my friend.
B00029JI70|5|Great for hot starting problems.
B008FCDM0A|4|Arrived on time. Works great on my Chevy truck. Would buy again!
B0027M2UP2|5|Works pretty good as a storage container for the stuff you want to pack with you when riding. The bag is water resistant but not waterproof, but no soft bags are really waterproof. The bag is quality made with two Velcro dividers inside to give you three adjustable compartments. I really like the quick disconnect fasteners on the bottom of the bag. It's a simple matter to quickly remove the bag from the rack if you are towing the ATV on a trailer or in the bed of your truck. I also like the suitcase style handle for when you remove the bag, beats bear hugging it. All in all price considered I am pleased.
B00M0GFI5E|5|Awesome product fit perfectly and looks amazing. And got me 2.3 mpg more. 04 hemi quad cab
B00N34486M|5|Great value, used on couple gm vehicles to check and clear codes
B001HJR9XE|4|very good item good price too
B00A6Z59DM|4|Great European euro plates, strong and durable.
B00Y3GZB5G|5|Worked Great!  No Problems.
B001EDK0WK|5|Excelente product
B00B7MWNOQ|5|Worked perfectly on my 2001 Dodge Ram.
B002E39YBW|5|Got the all too often code P0448 on my Nissan pick up truck & saw that this was likely the part (valve) that went bad.<br /><br />When I received the valve, I was surprised that it was pretty small, thinking the valve goes inside the canister.  However, once I pulled the canister from the pickup, I found it was mounted on the canister.  A simple 1/4 turn & the old valve can be pulled off and the new valve can be put on.<br /><br />The replacement valve is an exact duplicate of the one being replaced.<br /><br />Taking my time & being sure not to damage anything, the total time to replace the part to test drive took me just over an hour.  Not bad for a 62 year old rookie mechanic.  I'm sure I saved big bucks by replacing the part on my own.  And the ODB check engine light is off!
B00G8WLX78|5|Obvious high quality construction.  Large gauge wire. Works great.
B000P6QKXA|3|The chair seems small and the bag that you store it in is just solid black. Doesnt even match the chair
B000BRF3VS|5|Fantastic works perfectly and very nice to have.
B00BMPXGHQ|3|Worked good
B000I4JPZE|5|Love this product! I used it right away.. it was shipped sooner than expected!
B0060NKA1U|5|Excellent product. I installed this in place of my factory transmission cooler on my 2004 Silverado after seeing some elevated temperatures on long road trips. With the Tru-Cool 40k I have yet to see temps above 125, unless I'm sitting in grid lock with ambient temperatures above 100 degrees. I'm so pleased I will be installing this in my wife's 2007 Tahoe as well.
B00FB3GDXE|5|Perfect size and I love the white color on my red car. You can't really see it until you're pretty close ;)
B00DR0LFIQ|5|Perfect fit. Operates as expected.
B011BTDXM0|1|Wouldn't recommend anyone to buy visors of custom tuning the visors come used & scratched  & with re applied 3m tape they are not new
B005LTZL4U|5|Exactly what was expected.
B009DJTWSU|5|perfect fit ,quick delivery
B005LTIU9S|1|vienen con defectos,dont work property??????
B00JWSZPQK|5|Fast shipping for a custom made item, good quality.
B002IWYFVS|5|Amazing quality and it looks so real. I would highly recommend this as a gift or for yourself.
B00XXOIE6W|5|[[VIDEOID:5e548403c5c4cf30cef2c04ffea6e4ef]] I have about 10 of these batteries and I have tested and reviewed them all..I do not have one like this. I saw this and I had the chance to test it and I couldn't help but to get it. I was convinced there was no way this was going to jump a car or lawnmower or whatever. As soon as I got it I made sure it was charged and took it out to the mower. I have a 230a battery on there it is indeed dead..been dead for a week. I need a new one ....so I thought this would be perfect to try this on. As you can see in the video..it started my mower..WHAT? Yeah..I know. Guys I am convinced now. Now I would not put this on my Tahoe as it is not rated to be able to jump that huge motor...but it will go nicely in my wife's Honda Civic. It is a 2.4L and this says it can jump up to a 3.0 which is mainly a 4 cylinder or small v6. So that part worked....and worked well I might add.<br /><br />The battery portion is very similar to other charge packs in that it does have smart charging. It is an 8000mAh battery which can generally charge most of today's smartphones from dead to full a couple of times before needing recharged itself. The smart charging is very simple. Your device tells the battery how much juice it needs..the battery supplies it up to 2.1a. Most phones charge at 1a, bluetooths at.5a and larger devices like tablets at 2.1 or higher..So it won't overcharge your device. Its safe to plug it in and forget it.<br /><br />It does come with a manual which I encourage you to read and it comes with a standard usb to Micro USB cable...It also has cable that is a 4 n 1 adapter. It has all the ends you will need to charge apple products as well. Nice huh...<br /><br />After seeing it work first hand I giving this AFTERPARTZ X400 Mini Car Jump Starter 8000mAh 400 Peak Amp 12V, 5V/2A USB Output Portable Battery a very high 5 star rating. I wouldn't have believed it until I used it..but it works. this is going in my wife's car for emergency use. Well..after I get a new battery for my mower that is :)<br /><br />If you have any questions, please feel free to ask in the comments. I will respond. If you found my review helpful, let me know. Lets keep making better buying decisions together. Thank you and as always Be Safe & Happy Shopping!!<br />I received a sample product to test and evaluate.

B00540GOMY|5|Put this on my Toyota Prius 2013 (Regular one not C or V )and very simple to install.... Just as previous reviews stated. Unscrew two screws with philips one left  and on right, insert a hook in each screw and screw back in... and voila!  Its done...  The bottom just hook the square like stainless steel coming from the bottom and that is all. Took less than 5 minutes and done. Simple and very easy. Now I don't have my groceries rolling every time i drive. Very convenient.
B000JLNBW4|1|Frig.  died after using it for the first time.  I ran it for 2 or 3 days for refrigerated medicine, and it simply quit producing cold air. It didn't cycle on/off.  I did unplug it during the day.  Will have to replace it.  June 16, 2016
B002LWQ40K|5|Great quality and price you can never go wrong with felpro.
B00OD4B8W8|5|I love this
B000C1Q6MS|5|Replaced both sets of front pads. Exact fit. Installed at home in about two hours, with help from friend.<br /><br />My pair came with the metal back-plates attached. Double-check yours to see if you'll need to clean and transfer yours from old brake pads.<br /><br />Also includes small amount of brake lube. Would recommend purchasing brake cleaner and larger amount of lube.<br /><br />If you're going to install these yourself: take your time, clean parts as best as possible, re-lube and install.<br /><br />Zero squeaking during break-in period. VERY smooth slowing and stopping. My usual passengers could immediately tell a difference as well.<br /><br />Would buy and recommend this brand again after this experience.
B004HM0QBK|5|This gauge works great and saved me at least twice what I paid for it even though I did not do the repair. Because of the business of work and an unexpected trip out of town, I had to take it in to the shop to get me AC fixed. By diagnosing the issue myself, I was able to talk to the mechanic into simply replacing the clutch without removing the compressor. It cost a few a couple hundred dollars since we could not find anywhere that would sell just the A/C clutch for my Dodge Dakota.
B0032I9VK2|5|very good
B008EMSKHG|5|Good.
B00AFW0PC6|4|I would have given this product 5 stars but on the one side if I didn't use the rubber spacer it would rub on the paint.  Other than that it's awesome,  looks great love the sharp lines.  Easy to install takes 5-10 mins.  Not sure how durable I've only had it on for two months.  Well worth the investment.
B008L5J5G6|5|Fit just fine, and came fast. Thanks
B0002S9X30|5|these kinda look like loose crap when they go on,,, but, after a few days they tighten up.. they look like a perfect fit now
B00NMOYPVG|5|works well so far.
B00YYF1XLC|4|Overall decent product. It is designed for the bottom of car doors, I bought it for my Harley Street Glide, and where I want to put it on the bike is higher up than the lower portion of a car door, which is on the front fairing. I could mount them under the saddle bags, however want them on the front of the bike. when mounting up that high approximately 36 inches, the design disperses out further than I like, approximately 3-4 feet, was hoping to keep it smaller. and by the time it spreads out it looses a lot of the color, and detail becomes kinda grainy. But, like I said previously, it works adequately for what it is designed for. Would I recommend this product, or buy additional ones? Yes! the overall quality of the item is well built, actually pretty heavy duty. The wiring pigtail is a little small for my liking, however, is does not pull much amperage, so again, it is more than adequate for its use.
B00HT2Y7ZG|2|just expensive, can buy other similar with same results. returned it actually...
B0083G3AXC|5|Work great on my chairs. Very handy.
B00A14QLMG|1|I am very disappointed with this product, I bout a while ago and just now had time to put in then after about a month the lights inside burned out and no longer light up.Also when it did work it was very hot while the light was on.
B000M5WTKW|5|Easy to use and cuts down on spilled product.
B00IIOG6K8|4|I like the product but quality control was poor. The right hand glove was sewn smaller the the left. While the left hand slide right on, I was simply unable to get my hand in the right hand glove. A well built glove though just poor quality control.
B00AWNW9SQ|5|Fast delivery and working like a charm!
B0024E6QX0|1|It did not fit.
B00L8HAPPO|4|I ordered the silver. Although plastic it doesn't feel cheap. The way they made it doesn't allow the shifter to twist left or right, which was a concern. The screw to tighten is only to prevent it from being lifted off. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the tighten down screw is located conspicuously in the front. It could have just as easily been put in the back and you wouldn't be able to see it. See pic
B00GSAUHB8|2|Difficult to fold (very dressing actually). Far from being as practical as a foldable one
B00VJYI77O|2|did not fit modle it said it would
B000CMCNJC|1|This does NOT fit my 2006 Ford F150. Very irritating to be in the middle of a simple job and find out I don't have the right parts.
B000VL22R2|3|I believe the MagnaFlo system is Really Good, but: I have a 4&#34; system and I was given a 3-1/2&#34; U-bolt to clamp the pipe onto the existing pipe, the U-bolt wouldn't  go around it; also, I ordered a Cat back system and it came with an extra 5' pipe that would take it to the Turbo. Could have saved a lot of money paying for something I didn't need
B006GFLI0O|5|nice fit
B0042Z0E6E|5|Better than I expected. Perfect size to help keep camper clean and attractive at the same game. Storage bag a plus.
B005MVXTCI|1|This does not fit my make or model as stated
B0009YDQE4|2|It works, keeps the car clean.
B004FFHJ14|5|This subshader does a great job of covering every window opening (even the small side windows next to the windsheild). It keeps the car significantly cooler, even on days it's 108 outside.
B0002MABGE|4|Has been very helpful in keeping the dog from chewing up the seatbelts.
B001R9UTJ0|5|Works well. You can wear it many ways. Light and easy to breath thru. Good for summer and night riding, keeps bugs off...
B0049MXJA8|5|Good Price - Easy installation (Watch the Youtube video) - Fast Delivery
B0017R95DI|3|This vacuum pump is kind of a piece of crap. Don't get me wrong, it works... But it's just cheap and I don't think it will last long. With just my hose and micron gauge connected it pulled the hose down to 280 microns which is great. But I can't get it to pull any HVAC system down below 1000 microns... Even running for 4+ hours on a leak free system. I wish I would have not been a cheapskate and just sprung the extra hundred for a name brand vacuum pump.
B00T9XVY8G|5|Great price

B001TZEIBM|5|Great gun, takes a little bit to get used laying on Bedliner not paint but if done right it comes out flawless. I have already under coated a good and two full vehicles and it worked perfect. No need to thin or adjust anything, I was shooting rustoleum at 120 psi for a smoother surface.
B001RBCU90|5|love it.
B000C7YQ2Y|3|It works.
B00ECTQDAG|5|They are great lights I've had them on a truck 3 years and all the lights still work just bought 4 more for a new truck
B00DJ5KEF4|4|this is a great idea but I wont need it till after we lose power  which happens here in KCK
B0049HIKX4|5|Fit perfect!
B00W31VMYC|5|This product came with a disc that i probably should have put in my computer and taken a look at. I didn't because i wanted to see how easy this was to install. Easy enough that even a child can do it. You just have to know where your OBD2 port is on your car. Most are underneath the dashboard on the driver side. You need a good app to go with this product and i highly recommend Torque Pro (there is a free version of this app that works just as great). So here are the steps that i took:<br />1) Connected the reader to my OBD2 port (2007 Cadillac CTS Base)<br />2) Powered the device by turning my car on (starting the car is not required in order to power it)<br />3) Connected to the device through Bluetooth using my phone (Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge)<br />4) Opened up Torque Pro and linked the app to the device<br /><br />I dont want this to be a review for Torque Pro but this app really shows you how much information that can be pulled from the Oxford Bluetooth OBD2 Reader/Scanner Tool. If you are looking for an affordable reader that you can access at anytime from the convenience of your home without buying an expensive diagnostic machine, then look no further because you found your product right here.
B003VGL2F2|3|Light was brand new, came with  new bulbs. Great looking too. Screw post didn't line up really well but with some elbow grease I forced it into place. Works well after I plugged it up.

B00F8LEB9W|5|Another surprise - something cheap that actually works. Have used these for over a year.
B00GOUJ7VI|3|Easy install...tight fit originally, but after about a month I noticed I'm getting a little bit of separation between the flare and truck body at top of wheel arches. To be fair I haven't tried to adjust yet, but my confidence isn't high that will help based on its design.

B00MMKMRPM|5|Clip it on me all the time! So durable, have another keychain accessorize inside it and fits perfectly!
B000CIR1QG|5|Worked good. Will see if this breaks off next time I try to remove.
B00ZE5RGTY|5|To be totally honest, I first bought this product because of the super rad &#34;Baby on Board&#34; decal but I have really enjoyed the seat catchers the most! They are way more useful that I thought they would be and they prevent you from losing things in the side of the seat.... which I have done more times than I can count. The phone holder doesn't really grip to my dashboard due to all the curves in it but I use it on the console top so that my daughter can watch movies in the car! Keeps her quiet, therefore keeps me happy!<br /><br />I love that I was able to get so many items for such a low price! I looked at purchasing all of these items separately at Wal-Mart and it was going to be about $25 more than what this bundle sells for. Highly recommend!<br /><br />*I was given this product at a reduced rate in exchange for my honest opinion*
B007D3WL4A|5|This was a gift to me, I like it a lot
B000GU0MWA|5|Great product for the money.
B001C5O9P4|5|Fit my glasses well, no more dry eyes!  Great product!
B0039KZFSA|2|Front mats fit well and do seem right for the model.  Back mats do not fit and are not for the specified model.  I'd order from BMW directly.
B00CJ3KIEY|5|Very nice did what it supposed to do showed up on time
B0041TRSHY|5|Fits like a factory Nissan part.
B000NSL2S8|1|Arrived quickly and no core charge.  However, only lasted 5 months.  Had water in the motor.  Unit was poorly sealed when refurbished.  Motor housing o-ring was pinched and not installed correctly around mounting screw holes which allowed water in and ruined the motor.  Magnets in motor were loose when I disassembled to troubleshoot the problem.  To make matters worse, the plastic cowling you have to remove to get to the wiper motor gets brittle after 12 years and cracked after having to remove it for the second time this year to replace the new but defective motor.  Probably better to spend a bit more for a new unit and definitely would not recommend this item.
B00KEY9JBI|5|correct fit for my 2006 Nissan Altima so no problems

B00WNF9SQ2|1|I have a 2005 Nissan Frontier SE.  Everything worked on this switch except for the drivers window up control.  The defective switch was exchanged with another switch.  This switch had the same defect.  I purchased an OEM switch and it worked perfectly.  I would not purchase this switch if you every plan to lower your drivers window.
B000CITXQM|5|I really liked this product. I did not have a leaky or 'sticky' transmission, but I had another issue which this product fixed (not sure about the technicality of how or what was wrong). On my 16 year old Honda, I had a slight vibration when coasting at 40 to 50 mph, not always, but often. Also at ~80mph. I had it diagnosed, by shops and by researching online as anything from bad engine mounts, through worn serpentine belts, bad sparkplug, bad alighnment, worn ball joints, downright busted tranny, you name it. I suspect that, due to a busted thermostat which went untreated in that car for several years, the engine and transmission ran chronically a bit too cold. The car had developed a high oil consumption too (probably because of sticking engine parts), which regular SeaFoam applications cured after about 6 months. The tranny, I suspect, also ran cold and built up gunk which would have otherwise been melted back down into the oil. So this product, Trans-X slip-stop, has eliminated that vibration, and I can feel the tranny is slowly getting cleaned out and back to good condition. It took 2 full bottles to get it to stop shuddering. Other products I tried before this were the seafoam brand transmission fix fluid and a lukoil stop-slip oil additive and cleaner, both of which did not do much after running for a while. I started feeling the trans-x begin clearing up the problem on my way home from the auto parts store where I poured it in. Hope my experience helps someone who has a similar problem. I never figured that a vibration at higher speeds, especially since the car shifts great, could be due to a transmission issue. Probably the torque converter was gunked up. Who knows. Give this stuff a try if you have a tranny issue, and good luck.
B00L5RMPT6|5|I haven't used it (yet, and hope not to need to), but it looks and feels very strong, and is a generally ideal length for a tow strap. The bright, semi-reflective yellow is an added bonus. You don't need the surrounding traffic to guess correctly just from your movements whether there's a towing going on, which is largely what we all have to do when some dull, thin, and usually fraying piece of yarn is being used.<br /><br />Like most pieces of emergency equipment, the only really useful reviews are from those people (below) who can vouch for it from experience. And as they seem pretty consistent, I just wanted to add my own review in order to help keep this product available.
B0009ZEUU2|1|[[VIDEOID:d00b840e2eb015de35e6d741183ed931]] Wow, I decided to switch brand for my engine filter and it was a bad decision.<br />I put on this Fram CA6900 filter today for my Nissan Rogue SV 2011.<br />First of all, I am not sure why the listing shows the picture of the filter with the black rubber outer piece while the item I received, had the orange rubber outer piece.<br />And second of all, this Fram CA6900 filter did not really fit at all. I had to use tape to make sure it stayed in place (see my video).<br />I would not recommend it for Nissan Rogue 2011 at least.
B000C7S116|5|Great price
B0067UDERI|5|works great, arrived on time
B000C57YQG|5|Perfect
B0052UCFAQ|5|Arrived fast, easy to program myself. Perfect for my 2008 Nissan Pathfinder. It even rolls my windows down. Sweet!
B004O844DS|4|All in all this is a good product. The mounting could've been easier and I find myself tightening the mounts every now and then. The front part that says CURT is all wavy and not straight but that's probably cause I didn't put it on right but seems too be on right idk. But overall great basket!! Deffiently need the extension!
B009DPP6QQ|5|Great monitor and tuner loaded a couple of custom tunes and I was off and running
B00OPMIR2M|4|easy to use. I like the illumination.
B00SN99ARO|5|I bought this for my new Triumph Explorer 1200.  The top of the gas tank on the bike is rather small and oddly shaped.  I was concerned a bag that was bigger than this one wouldn't fit properly.  I was also hesitant to put a magnetic tank bag on my new paint, but I'd hear good things about the Oxford products.  I took a chance on this bag & I'm very glad I did.<br /><br />The bag isn't overly small.  It actually has quite a bit of room in it and should suit my needs just fine.  As pictured here on Amazon, the bag is in it's most compact form.  You have the option of unzipping the bag around the circumference which allows for you to pull the bag up a couple of inches.  I haven't loaded it with a lot of stuff, but I was able to fit a ball cap, owners manual, registration, keys, and two wallets inside the bigger of the two compartments.  There was still plenty of room left.<br /><br />The smaller compartment with the clear window is perfect for holding your cell phone or other electronic device.  There is the typical rubber port on the side of the smaller pocket so you can run in a power lead, or headphones.  The plastic is touch sensitive, so you can still work your touch screen with it in there.<br /><br />There is one drawback to putting your phone in the pouch.  It will overheat.  At least mine did.  I put my iPhone inside the pouch and zipped it up.  I was riding to my dealer for bike service when I noticed the HOT warning on my phone.  It then shut down.  I suppose it might be possible that if you left the zipper partly open so air could circulate, this might not be a problem.  Makes no difference to me though.  I still like the bag and will just figure out something else to do with my phone if it keeps getting too hot in there.<br /><br />Everything else about the bag so far is just perfect.  Thank you Amazon, and thank you Oxford for this tank bag!
B004TRKBOK|5|I bought two of these - one for my husband's car and one for my car. I tested them out on some hard plastic just to see how sharp the blade was and it sliced it in half in seconds. I have no doubt that this will work when/if the need arises.
B00X4TX6EG|1|The first pair didnt work at all...going to try a second time ...I hope replacements work
B004LX3AS6|5|Works great
B0023V9HO4|5|Looks great!!!!
B006ZSULNC|5|Worked very well, and was far less expensive than the dealer price.
B00UG52P7U|2|It seems to be a well built organizer. The Samsung Galaxy 3 fits with room to spare. My son is excited for me to get it mounted so he can use the additional storage space for snacks. The issue is if your vehicle seat headrest is integrated with the rest of the seat, the strap is no where near long enough. Fully extended, it is only 13&#34;. For my Colorado, it would need to be about twice that length, rough estimate based on the end of the strap being mid way around the headrest. I would have continued my search had I known it would not fit the seat.
B00B2I3EE8|5|Matched my Corolla 11&#34; very well, great material and the 3m adhesive tape is very strong
B00BQE5JAK|3|Not bright at all!

B00J3NPOI8|2|Really disapponted with this. Really cheap quality. Cover began to rip when putting it on. The &#34;Jeep&#34; logo was not even centered in the cover. Don't waste your money!
B001VLK0RA|3|If I would have reviewed this last week when I first used it, it would have been 5 stars. I guess the old saying &#34;you get what you pay for&#34; applies here. I got this to siphon the clean water into 2 fish tanks as the manual bulb-one I had just wouldn't cut it. This siphon worked GREAT for about the first 6-8 uses, albeit quite a bit slower than the other &#34;automatic&#34; one I have. When I was using it today, though, it started making a loud noise. I have no idea why or where the noise is coming from, but noticed a drastic reduction in water flow. I'm hoping it's something that will either stop or can be fixed inexpensively as I'd like to replace that so-called automatic siphon I have with another one of these. When this works, it works great and saves a great deal of hassle and headaches when changing fish water.
B000BYEKCY|5|Kept getting Cylinder #2 misfire and spark was ok. Replace just that plug and haven't seen an engine trouble light since. And, didn't have to pull the engine to effect a cure. (Those back three plugs are tough)

B008AH8PCA|5|Love it!
B0071JJYLO|5|Made finding the root cause of an issue with the Bosch DME on my 944 so much easier.  The quality was better than expected.
B00OBB41QS|5|Much brighter than some of the less expensive LED fixtures. Great for RV in places where you need more light, kitchens and baths for example and you have 2 light levels, half and full. I've had them, 3, for a month and no troubles, hope that continues.
B000BUU5XQ|5|Nice Package they actually fit along side block back and can be used on top of yellow blocks. Very light weight.

B005G8DAT4|5|As advertised. Thanks!
B00JA3BMDW|5|At this price point, this is a great product, a great value, and well worth a five-star rating. It is very simple to use, and is very useful.  I've used the gun to check the temperature my A/C is pushing out of my vents, and to check for excessive heat coming in around windows and doors. I also plan to take it when we go camping so that I can measure the tire and hub temperature of my travel trailer. This product truly has many helpful applications.  The display is backlit to allow easy reading in darker conditions. The backlighting cannot be turned off (at least, not that I've found), and it is lit regardless of the amount of light in the room. This surely has a negative impact on battery life, but I'm still using the included battery after an hour or more of use.  The gun's use interface is very simple: it only has three buttons, plus the trigger. Using these buttons, you can configure the unit to display results in either Fahrenheit or Celsius. You can also choose whether or not to display a visible laser when taking measurements; this feature could potentially extend battery life.  The last option is to adjust the emissivity of the object being measured, in order to increase the accuracy of the reading. Objects being measured have different levels of emissivity; for example, rock has an emissivity of 0.7, while human skin has an emissivity of 0.98. By adjusting the gun's emissivity, you should be able to take more accurate readings.  To adjust the emissivity, simply press the Mode button (the middle one). The current emissivity setting is displayed. You can then adjust the level downward by pressing the left button, and upward by pressing the right one.  The one drawback is that the gun does not measure a consistent temperature over distance. Up close, I measured the temperature of a lamp shade (with the lamp on), and the temperature was 90.3 F. From about eight feet further away, the same spot on the shade measured only 86.9 F.  However, this inconsistency, forme at least, does not diminish the usefulness of the product. If I had a critical need for more accurate, more consistent measurements, I would buy a top-of-the-line model. But this model suits my needs perfectly, and I would buy it again if needed.
B00ZVA6PEY|3|this is just a label that is stick onto the metal frame, it started to come up on the edges already but ok for the price paid

B002HVJ7H2|5|Using Standard Motor Products for many years. Although I would like to see them manufacture in the USA.
B00B9IVRCW|4|I've only had it installed for a couple of days, but it works and works well.  I was a bit leary because there seemed to be several people having problems with disconnected ground wires in the motor area - but I'd heard they were fixing this issue and this 1 is fine. The bolts holding my old jack in place were rather rusty & stuck (penetrating oil works wonders), and my security chains were partially blocking the hole in the bottom of the trailer tongue & needed to be loosened, moved, & retightened (yay for penetrating oil again) - what should have been a 45 minute job took closer to 2.5 hours, but it's worth it. Oh, I didn't see this in the product description, but the unit head has a small led on it so you can see the trailer tongue in the dark (to aid in hooking it up, or so you don't run into it walking back to camp at night). Manual crank on top works too, so you can still use it if your battery is dead. Why 4 stars? 1) haven't had it too long so can't yet speak as to longevity / reliability. 2) bubble level on top is a nice idea, but it's worthless in the sun (which is just about always) - fluid heats up & expands, and no more bubble in the level.
B004I13HIO|2|This is not a good fit it leaves gaps all around the enclosure.  Hardly what I consider a direct replacement.
B00FS9I7SA|4|Came as discribed, nice finish , better price then some of its competitors.
B000EQW03U|5|Great product & price!  Perfect for adding trunk switch, (I'm adding in glove box area) where one isn't offered.  You need to locate your BCM<br />(main wire connector junction that houses several different wiring functions through out vehicle) that applies to your specific vehicle.<br />Just get pin-like wire end - crimp on type; (may need to smash end with hammer)& insert in wire connector for proper relating device (truck switch).<br />It can squeeze in next to specific wire connector housing & share connection.  You may want to wrap with electrical tape to keep from dislodging.  You can also put loop / curve wire in a way that applies pressure in the connector where it won't dislodge (if you don't want to tape).  In any case the pin-like wire end (if shaped right) will &#34;squeeze in&#34; correctly which will also hold it in; while giving good contact.<br />Hope this helps!
B00SC85CGY|5|Mirror is a perfect match for stock 01 Jeep Cherokee .
B009UHKOEG|5|I got this for my husband. He loved it. Very good quality. Looks great on his bike

B004OSSCYA|5|Very good comprehensive kit works very good .
B0083CJAOO|5|Nice and bright for plowing at night
B007RVQZUY|5|Easy to install and less expensive than a auto parts store. Super impressed so far!
B00PJ3ACOW|5|Good size and quality and super easy to apply
B006P87ZV8|5|Cool patch. Looks good.
B00G3Z3TMM|5|Works Great.
B004ETK0AI|5|Stores all of my belongs and does exactly what it says!
B00P9VOARY|1|Didnt  fit . no  instructions.  Returned for a refund
B0006UEXG6|1|Junk.  Seizes up and kills the engine constantly.  I have purchased two of these with the same results.
B000E5W9MS|5|As advertised :) best filter on the market. Very easy to install on your car
B00U7QJKS0|4|Got them in hand yesterday. Finish is excellent but won't be installing until next weekend. Likely to do an update then.
B001KWINUQ|5|Bought this for my daughter's car, makes the car look hundred percent better... Hopefully she won't lose any more, or maybe she should lose his driver's license
B0049BNZXK|1|First issue I had was the connector, had to flip an incert on the connector to fit my vehicle, once installed when i ran it to go up, it goes down and vice versa.  Disapointed, it was advertised as drivers side.
B005TY2KCI|5|Since my arm is lying on the consule cover on a regular basis I saw this and said why not! I am glad that I did. While being comfortable it is also a great protection for your middle consule. Fit my 2014 Rogue / X-Trail with ease
B00J40BGPK|1|The LED strip is out after three week of use.<br />Looked for poor connection. All checks good.<br />The lights look amazing. Wish I would get a response from manufacturer.
B001F212OK|5|Just as good as the Harley one with less cost!
B00L7X80AG|3|I'm about to buy them for my 95 tahoe, but do they come as a pair. Left and right or what? Plz help.
B00X2TUW1I|5|The larger sized shades cover almost the full window of a large SUV. Construction seems to be good and they were easy to stick on. They seem to adhere well.
B00BE25WC4|5|Fired right up!
B000C5G944|5|Had a slight overheating problem in the summer heat. Flushed and replaced coolant and a few hoses along with the thermostat. Car runs perfect now. Can run the A/C on high in 90+ weather and temp stays right in the middle.
B007WEZLQA|5|Exactly what I wanted. Works great!!
B0014H7LL4|3|Worked good for a few months. But like other reviews on here it does turn a copper color and the paint wears down fast. I guess it's worth $3-4. I recently purchased a nicer leather Ford key chain, cost more but I'm much happier with it.
B00252HVRQ|5|Fit well. This, plus replacing spark plugs provided the car with a great tune up at 160k miles.
B00FJHTCEO|5|I used it with a microfiber cloth and it really worked. Cleaned the fabric seats really well!
B00FXAIUCC|5|Luv
B008EFHUYW|5|good value
B00XRPZTGU|4|Product as advertised... good quality... good price... not available locally... bought extras for the future...
B00DIV0YZ4|5|I have used this for years on my seadoo PWC with power vales over ams oil
B00F06LU4O|4|Works as expected, the bulbs actually move in and out when you turn high beams on and off.  The harness is great.  I wish it had a cover for the unused connector on the factory harness.  I have experienced one light not coming on but it is most likely the ballast that I already had.
B00UL3DIL4|5|Took only minutes to install.  Perfect fit
B000C9Y1FE|5|As described
B003E3K9O2|5|Superb product!! it will give your Honda a classy look with you spending a ton of money. I bought this grill and was able to up the price on my Hondqa when when I sold it by $800. Not a bad investment!!
B00GRHRTEU|4|Love em but they whistle.  Wrapped them with black electrical tape and the whistle stopped.  The problem is the rubber seal around the outside, they have a lip that catches the wind.  I plan on using silicone for a more permanent solution.  Still a nice product.  Nice and big mirror, good quality.  Padding on the back of the bracket and new screws included!  I used the plastic washers from the original screws on the back of the bracket because the body of the jeep has a little recess, the washers fill them perfectly.  You may have to squeeze the bracket together a little to make tightening the mirror down a little easier but no big deal.
B00APOFQYQ|5|This was the perfect replacement and it was easy to install. It was expensive for a visor, but it was much cheaper on Amazon than buying it for the Honda dealer.
B00473VQ9K|4|For the most part ok, but left side does not fit like right side or oem. Came with stop & tail (led) not only connectors on both sides not plugged in all the way, but polarity crossed, if I hadn't known that diods only flow current in one direction I would have thought they were defective, not worth $200.00+
B00HSUTZKG|5|Looks great - stands up to the weater, car washes, etc.
B00Z7KIZPA|5|The Purse Pouch is amazing!  The pouch easily holds a box of Kleenex, your chihuahua (see pictures), etc.!!  Then, your big purse (like I have) rests against the outside of the pouch.  It is held in place securely, but is still very accessible.  Great and versatile product!
B001DRJO3S|5|Good quality
B00B81780K|5|Exactly what I needed to anchor the 4 pin harness to my curt hitch bar.
B008P7BEQE|5|Looks so cute in my car!
B001G4Z5J0|5|Great carrier!  Much bigger than I expected and very well made.  Glad I purchased this one instead of the cheapy from the local big box store.
B004GE9B24|5|Worked as advertised, looks good.
B000BUOSC0|5|Perfect!
B0002SRL20|5|Excellent Fuel Gauge.  Gotta be one of the best in the industry.  We've got one of these at work that's been around for quite some time and it is still working great.  The one at work is the reason I ordered one for home.  Highly recommended.
B00JA3BMDW|5|Received on time and as described. Will use again.
B0015RFIWM|1|One of the bolts broke while installing.
B0032VWWMS|5|Good product.  My MSD 10 doesn't cause it issues like other wide band oxygen have with a high voltage CDI box.  If you are looking for a wide band that works well with methanol this one works very well.  I have bought 4 total and I will continue to buy more of them as needed.
B00200C5SI|5|Best value for DOT 5 silicone brake fluid.  The best to have for longevity for antique cars or vintage muscle cars.
B001V45YHI|5|Love them, they work great, are very bright and come off easy for monthly vehicle washings.
B0009OA4JO|5|Fit well looks great
B001GBGA0G|5|Pluged right in worked great
B00EA18D2M|5|Exactly what was needed to complete the install of a curt hitch. I installed it on a 13 Santa Fe and the lengths were sufficient.
B000VT0JLU|5|cancelled order
B0027I8CU8|5|As expected good quality
B00DQJ8T00|3|Easy to install. Looks good. Signal cuts in and out sometimes on the AM station I listen to. Haven't noticed it on FM stations.
B00F7GYVCU|5|Good decal
B00JF5FAHO|5|I wish all bits were designed like this, excellent product, just what I needed to rescue the rear centre seat belt in our Jetta Stationwagon. I still had to figure out how to rotate the seat out, but you can actually avoid having to do that, thanks to these ultra-short and external hex, bits.
B0095OIWB6|5|Better than advertised.
B002LLE5WK|5|I installed the motor gear assembly in minutes.  The original controller worked so I did not have to replace the controller or the magnetic door switch.  The steps are back in full automatic mode.
B000FQ7MC8|1|This socket was not deep enough for my 1946 cj2a. It should have been at least 1/4 to 1/2 inch deeper.
B0083H7YH4|5|Item arrived as described. Very happy with item.
B0002Q86M6|3|Easy install, looks good but not loud enough.
B000NJSHJ4|2|Not great quality. Cheap materials in my opinion. And I normally wear a 13 size shoe and I ordered 13 in these boots and are too big. Not sure if a 12 would be too small. But they don't run small for sure.
B0058SQXKU|5|Works great, awesome deal to.
B0049J9KCW|5|Fits like it should for a fraction of the cost of a OE replacement converter. I have two Camry's, I have installed this system on each of them.
B00DPICNJU|5|Great job, came quick, nice price
B00198HRBC|4|One of the screw holes was off a little. Led to a little difficult to screw in but got it.
B004LFABDQ|1|The description said it was in very good condition. But the axle was bent and the inner leg was jammed so far inside the leg that it was nearly impossible to get out. To anyone in the same position that wants to get the inner leg out, take off the top cap and use a long dowel and a hammer to push the inner leg down from the top. I used the axle from the leg that had originally broken and was able to get this one working so it wasn't a total loss.
B008WFPCDA|1|Piece of junk.
B00MNRA828|5|Great size for middle of back window
B000EQPU0U|5|Aaaaaa Bbbbb ccccc
B005N53C9I|5|A bit less cost than what I paid for my last seat covers at Walmart and. I think the quality of this cover is much better.
B00G2TV7OG|5|very bright  good price
B00KWGMG3G|5|Perfect fit! Coz its original !<br />Tested it and n the rain, perfect clean sweep!<br />So happy!
B000C96O8Q|4|Compared to the one I took out, this is cheaply made.  The firing end of the rotor that feeds spark through distributor cap was clearly much thinner, hence earlier burn out.  Truck runs much better.  My 13 year old daughter is now sold on stick shifts because we can 'lay rubber', 'get scratch', 'squeal the tires' etc.  Yay.  Dad was Cool again for a few minutes...
B000VTWQUW|1|Thank you for sending me the WRONG ONES, I am now stuck with it because I didnt really they were wrong until after date passed that I could return them. My suggestion...DONT BUY FROM DEE ZEE, EVER.
B00GSAUHB8|5|I love my Sun Shades.  I purchased one for both cars.
B00KGT9IUS|5|Great little light for the price.
B000C9DBMS|5|Fit like a glove.
B008CLIKEW|5|OEM part, fit in perfectly.  Only thing that it didn't come with is the red plastic plug that goes over the screw once its installed.  Not a big deal though and it works fine without it.
B00L7TO7CA|5|High quality rotors for the money.
B00M9MWHXA|5|Looks great, solid build.
B000CKN776|5|Worked great on my 1994 dana 30 axles. Expensive but it's the only u joints I could fine that fit
B00RV6207W|4|not bad for the price, but definitely not name brand.
B004B159MI|5|Well made!  Very elegant!!!
B00RCT3F7C|3|The actual wing is ok quality but the chain is like something you'd get out of a quarter machine.
B000MR2VH6|2|I used this product to &#34;maintain/regenerate&#34; the fairly old 12V 70 AH 680 CCA lead-calcium battery in my car. I left it connected in parallel with the battery for about 3 months. The car was regularly driven during this period. I used a YT-8310 load tester to determine if the battery had improved but the reading was the same as it was before connecting the product (about 3 months ago). Precisely, it was still in the yellow/weak zone at 10.4 V, as before. Although the product looks good quality made it does not work. I will not buy this or other similar products again.
B00N4WIAE4|5|as advertised good value
B00G0LFXSC|5|Perfect fit. Looks and works better than ever.
B006ZVLXSG|5|it worked and was well packaged
B005OCJDHU|1|Suck if you want to set a car on fire done by these
B00306912Y|5|Easy installation. Reasonably close color match.
B00CQNERXU|4|nice fit and function
B00LNDYKG8|5|This was an exact replacement for the exterior light above the door on my Ice Castle fish house. Looks like it's a quality made product and it even came with a new bulb. Great price and great seller.
B00DD9ELDW|5|This item was as described. It fit and plugged up with no modifications.
B012CKPDIO|5|Gracias
B001UFRUXO|5|Does what the description describes. I can add easily 2000 lb more pounds.
B00J6ZI566|1|This will not fit a 2015 KIA Sorrento
B00QW3QVAW|4|Everything fine & good delivery service...  not installed yet but not expecting issues...
B009D2R5YU|5|Opens and closes pretty easy if you grab it with the other hand.
B00O91BMG2|5|good item
B0076PXV4Y|5|Fit great! Will buy the other side too.
B008G1ZX2K|5|loved loved loved  and is real bright
B00H6XPZN6|2|ok but falls off sometimes.
B00HHGS6QU|5|perfect fit. no issues with cruise control.excellent price
B003E7S9U4|4|Direct replacement.
B00WID0OEE|5|Very nice,  best I've ever had.
B00T3OTKSC|5|Soft and makes my handle bars happy
B001P2B998|5|Perfect.
B000CIC21U|1|I previously had this rated as a 4, but had only driven the vehicle once or twice at the time of that review.  I still don't know exactly what was going on, but the motor would just randomly shut off like you turned the key off and not restart.  I suspect the unit that replaces the actual points had a faulty internal connection.  It stranded me twice, the second time requiring a tow truck to get the car back to my shop.  Reinstalled the original points and my car is 100% again.
B0089KNC8A|1|Not working
B001EOV492|4|After looking at ball mounts locally, they were all cheaply welded.  This is significantlly better quality than what was available from hardware stores locally.  I used it to tow a 944 from CA to TX and with a motorcycle trailer a few times since then.  Zero issues, and even the chrome is still intact.
B00BFYGNKG|5|Love it!!
B00KZJQ2L2|5|A very noticeable difference in the temperature inside the truck because it actually fits.  I drive a Dodge Ram 1500 Quab Cab and it covers every inch of the windshield.
B00U1OFYWE|1|Very uncomfortable
B00BCRMAAS|3|Top cover for rear seat zips and doesn't accommodate seat belts got mt 60/40 seat. Therefore using bench seat cover and the front seat covers.
B000BQQMY6|3|I bought this at Pep Boys where it was branded as &#34;Bully Hitch Mounted Cargo Carrier&#34;. I agree with other reviews regarding the amount of sway. When loaded down, as you take turns it will dip laterally, making a noise and in some cases scraping. Over time this would lead to breaking -- either the rack or your hitch.<br /><br />Some designs of this product type are such that the rack is raised several inches, instead of straight through as this one is. For many installations, the straight thru design results in the rack being too close to the ground. When you add the sway mentioned above, it results in the corners dipping and scraping in turns. I ended up having to buy an adapter to raise the rack a few inches.<br /><br />It does not come with reflectors, which I think you should have in most states and it should come with the product.<br /><br />I do not agree with the reviews regarding issues related to the rack being too close to the exhaust muffler. Well, I guess I agree somewhat because I don't like the straight thru design, and if they had designed it to raise up a few inches, that would result in better placement regarding the exhaust. But it is the installers responsibility to insure the installation is proper in this regard. The maker can't possibly know what brand of receiver hitch you put on your vehicle, etc.
B007RY7JCY|5|Exelente
B000F3RYGA|5|Very good lock mechanism well worth the money spent. Very easy to install and use. Better than some of the cheaper ones you can get at big box store.
B00GHT6SF4|5|It was easy to put on, just what I needed
B00W31VMYC|2|Paired with my Galaxy S5 with no issue. No of the readings worked for my 03' Nissan Frontier.
B00AYAIC8I|5|Work really well. Easy to fit. Clean the window perfectly.
B0012UK3M2|5|Easy  to install.
B00CT31F96|3|Seems to work fine, installed ok.
B00L4G52N4|5|fre good
B00BCRMC3I|4|Fantastic quality for the price. Didn't want to spend a ton of money to put my 1995 car back in style, and this did the trick! Love them!
B00Y1UXZFW|5|Worked great..super bright and a nice smooth install.
B007UTPUDQ|5|great looking and working
B006FW3G2G|4|Seems well made, keeps a lightly used newer vans battery ready for use. I had a 1 1/2 watt one, but after a few weeks the battery wouldn't start the van. Does not happen with this one. But it is rather large. I just plug it into a live power port (cigarette lighter) and set it on the dash.
B0014FGS6U|4|Relatively easy to install, works great for the bike rack we bought.
B000MJXQ64|5|Exactly what it says it was and worked as well as it needed to.
B005AWOF1S|4|I had to drill the holes out for the wooden brace but it holds my 9.9 long shaft fine
B00SVBT6JG|5|Perfect for the iPhone 6. Stays on the tank with no problems. Being at a 100 and it stay on
B00E4YP4UO|5|Love this thing! Too bad my windshield was destroyed and I lost it :(
B001CF4UWG|5|Haven't had to use it yet but it's very strong
B00EAJX928|5|Excelente
B00RSOLXFM|5|I use this in my bathroom & with an odor eliminator I can't even smell my kitty litter box.
B00B2CG0TA|5|Good quality mat that is easy cut to fit install. Not a thick heavy mat, so it can be easily rolled up or folded if you need the third row seats. Added bonus - the pattern embossed in the mat matches my 2015 Dodge Durango interior floor mats and rear step.
B00HWCXE4I|4|Was reluctant about this product, but really amazed by the easy installation.so far performance has been great.
B003E5T00Y|4|Sounds amazing
B0006SH4GE|5|Best cleaning product I have ever tried. Works fantastic!!!!
B0027UPPQA|5|Perfect
B0093RRSXS|3|Good seller but clips breaks to easy
B00G620ZVU|5|Came quickly..works great...very BRIGHT lights. Very pleased with my purchase.
B00DSD63KC|5|Nice item
B000PD70KU|4|We did not always keep these mounted to the slide out corners, but use only each time slide out is opened. Since the storage area is under the slide out, this product helps to prevent my husband from &#34;putting another hole in his head, lol&#34;. They work as a visible remaindered of corner and help cushion the blow.
B00497AVX6|5|Just what was needed
B004LF6MAC|5|Works as advertized. Does a great job.
B000EBICHI|5|fast shipping, good price
B00JFFG67C|5|Easy connection/works great, wish antenna was a bit shorter.
B00KE1AV0O|4|cute, I love it.<br />It's soft and easy to put on the belt.<br />A bit hard on a hot summer day, but a really cool item
B00ET45QCA|4|Fit perfectly
B00WIUB6FS|4|Well, it is a frame, and it does let most of the stickers on the plate show. It's a little thin, but still strong, and it uses the plate as a bit of reinforcement as well. The logo on mine is more green than gold, but still the same otherwise.<br /><br />The semigloss black looks good on my car, and fits right into the plate well on the front.<br /><br />I did receive this at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review of it.
B00BVB5HFA|5|Good
B00CGGXQV6|5|Great product. Great fit. Easy install.  No problems at all!
B009NWLEII|5|Grateful deal and very quick shipping Thank you.
B00HJDY6PG|5|We had just bought a new Highlander, but it didn't have a cargo net.  I was surprised to see a genuine Toyota net for such a low price on Amazon.  The net is high quality and we use it all the time!
B00MMYA0L6|5|Works just as advertised. These are external vinyl type peel stickers.
B00JBI9TL8|4|Very cool lights on my 2013 Chevy Cruze. Only downgrade is the CCFL Bar and the Halo need to be brighter, but other than that, I am very pleased with the way they came out.
B00D7QHSKY|4|Fits my Saturn L200 2003 very well, I'm happy with my purchase.
B00HZUIQF4|4|It was what I wanted. Fit
B005JUOG9W|5|Great
B00CAX5XAM|5|Kick ass look on a kick ass bike
B00LTKF35W|5|Works great and so easy.
B00C8C6IEK|1|Plastic broke off in the transmission dipstick tube. Terrible product.
B009R6I4R4|5|It works like it supposed to
B00E3JKOYG|5|Good fit
B006QGD996|4|Straps are long, ratchets accurate, and handles when they stay on, are comfortable. Does the job. Have not had any issue other than the rubber grip coming off, but it goes right back on.
B00BXLEI2G|5|Works great
B002VL3NCI|5|Works well better then most products
B009FUF6DM|5|Good clothes for the right price.  A million uses. And if you really mess one up on a tough job,  you don't feel too bad about throwing it out.
B00FS873ZO|5|Neat product. It's a flashing light..can't screw it up too bad
B005VNM1EO|5|It's been installed on my dad's truck for about 4 months now.  Works great, no problems!
B008G2BJU4|5|The lights are exactly as described, and look identical to factory headlights.
B00BFE5YQU|5|Original Really Nice
B001GC2LVM|5|These work excellent! They remove all the difficulty of leveling the camper. I just pull forward until the 5th Wheel reads level and lock it down. I have a level on the gooseneck, so I can level it right from the driver's seat. When storing the camper, I pull onto all four and the tires are off the ground!
B004JB1MSU|5|Fit my 2005 Xterra perfectly
B003CJHPHW|5|Great product! Pattern is on both sides and it's a soft material, unlike most other bandanas you'd find out there.
B005R4L7WO|5|Excellent. Would do business again. Thanks for the great product.
B010H0QV00|5|Works great, and is a multi-use tool. Has everything you need.<br />If you need a useful gift for someone that is hard to buy for, and they have a car, this is it. Something everyone can use, should be in every glove compartment.<br />Sample provided, with no obligation to review.
B007222D7W|1|Bad quality
B0009V4GHI|5|excellent
B0017L7E9Q|5|Work great - not as bright as I had hoped - but better than the OEM bulbs.
B001P6GONU|1|My son wanted to dress like a spy for Halloween, and this fit the bill price wise, but it fell apart after one night of use. The handle came right off. Do not buy this if you want to use as in daily life as a &#34;real&#34; briefcase.
B00N9XVP9U|5|Works as advertised. Everyone should have one in their boat, car and RV.
B002P9VSKK|5|Great
B005HFYE1O|4|great, I needed this particular relay for wiring a remote for my doors on my 1995 E350
B0071N6VX4|5|Nice fit. Easy to install with one person.
B0010E00T6|5|As advertised.  Easy install in 2013 Honda Accord
B00D5O1SIQ|5|Can't be beat for the price! Fit my 06 mx-5 just fine.
B001CEG90I|5|Fresh breeze it is!!
B00S5LQSJI|5|The item met my full expectations.
B005XDM0XO|4|Works for my 94 Suzuki Intruder 1400, just the included straps felt way too weak, bought 2 heavier straps and bike had no problems at all on city and highway
B0002BC0PA|5|Works good, also works good on plastic pop pins as well.
B006QWFPRY|2|color didn't match.
B00K9B9K6K|5|Very satisfied.  Delivered on time as well. Thanks.
B000EALHHG|5|I can't function without it. Cleaning latex paint from brushes, pre-treating grease spots before laundry, Engine compartment cleaning, general parts degreasing, cleaning oil stains on concrete,  adding a dash to vinegar for calcium build up on faucets, and a hundred other uses. I always keep at least a gallon in reserve so i don't run out.
B00JRE38EA|5|Nice and bright. Nice change from dull yellow of regular incandescents. Brightened up the interior of my wrangler a lot. Only time will tell how long they last, but so far, I am very happy.
B006X8B1LU|5|Good  quality gives the car a more better look
B007P74A2U|5|Nice kit
B00HKTMQQ0|4|As described.
B00B2ATTUE|5|Work great once you own a pair you'll never not have a pair. Really makes the trailer solid.
B00MAOKATA|5|Excellent!
B00P00TP42|1|I am not happy with this . Finally put it on , barely fit my car , seams started ripping .
B003YCZ1F0|4|Product just as advertised. Great merchant
B00LEBLI82|3|I recieved the bulbs and they were blue not clear. I used the blue bulb and it is not a good choice for an avid RV.
B00BVB4SBY|5|I installed these on my e46 in less than two hours without the need of special tools. Old ones were easy to remove, and new ones easy to put on with the help of some WD-40. The quote from my mechanic was $560.00 including labor. He could not explain to me why the $510.00 in labor after he saw I did it myself.
B008GT18M6|5|great fit
B00I5057HI|1|This product will fit on a 2010 Silverado will lift over 3 inch in the front and will put too much stress on your top ball joint I would not recommend it
B00RQS7QWY|4|These lights are amazing for the price, The only reason why it lost a star is due to the fact that the system does not remember the last channel used. Check out this video i made highlighting it during dusk.<br /><br />Check out this video that is recorded at dusk for more info about the product,<br />Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gaxxb5j3dZg<br /><br />Would recommend to a friend.
B00K6D487C|1|Ordered 4 of these switches, after 5 months 3 of them went bad with next to no use. Contacted seller and was told only 3 month warranty  junk!!!
B00O4Z5XOA|5|Amazingly comfortable. fits perfectly. I was really impressed by the comfort of this even in the wheel well location. Great Product. Highly recommended.
B001G3P01Y|5|Hard to get it but finally I got it is was the right kind.<br />Thank you
B002UR4BXS|5|looks good
B00T36K4T4|3|The rv cover was lightweight and reasonably easy for 2 people to install. Ours was for a fifth wheel. The front fit well over our rounded top, but the front straps aren't long enough to reach to the buckles on the tire poles that you're supposed to buckle into. We just tied the straps to parts of the RV on the front. The back of the cover didn't fit well at all. The straps are long enough in back to buckle correctly, but there is way too much extra roof cover and no apparent way to cinch it around the back like there is the front. Seems like the wind can easily get up underneath and blow the whole cover off or rip it to shreds. I'll try to modify the back with clips and bungy cords tomorrow to take up the slack.
B00BAZCQS8|5|and still bright as the brand name bulbs
B0092KVYGI|5|I'm using the devices to monitor the battery and charging system for two of my vehicles.  They work great!
B00E1PTB1O|5|Great statement!
B0068OBIRQ|5|Color is amazing.<br />You have to be careful when torquing your wheels on so that you don't scratch the paint. :/
B00K5A90SS|5|Excellent perfect fit looks brand new
B00CB8WM2S|5|I haven't actually tried this yet and I hope I never have to but I feel a lot better knowing it's in my car if I ever need it. I like the seat belt cutter on it and it is very sturdy. I'm sure it could definitely do the job if I need it. I got a great deal on this product in exchange for an honest review.
B006VGEPA8|5|So far evrything that i ordered met all my expections. i am very please with all,
B004DVAT0I|5|The price was right and is working great.  Thanks.
B000BWCERY|5|Works well.
B004I10H9Q|5|Was delivered fast and great price
B00068VBX6|4|Let me start by saying that this was my first time ordering from amazon.service, order processing and delivery was excellent. As far as the shift knob goes it looks great in my 1990 convertible mustang and it feels good when i shift gears but is NOT real carbon fiber.so if you are looking for real carbon fiber this shift knob is not the one.
B00U9YPRTG|1|Didn't even fit
B00RV417XM|3|Super awesome product A month later ballast make buzzing around and randomly don't always start, takes about a minute for lights to fully heat up
B006R0XYGY|5|Great
B004JVLWBW|4|Good quality
B00585H6A4|1|Not happy with this decal I did buy it a while ago but I just got my new 2015 car and wanted to put this on my new car the decal kept on sticking to the paper and just not happy with it and did keep the decal in my home and still stuck to the paper and ripped
B00KTE0P2A|5|Excellent product, fast shipping. Just what I expected. Totally recommended.
B00CMY1FME|4|High quality, beautiful colors (we’ve bought red, navy and black in various car mfg.). You can find these for many different cars.  With keys attached on both ends, it’s long, for me a bit too long.  So I sometimes take the push clip release ring on to the spring release so it doesn't dangle so much.  Other than that our family loves them.
B009S9RP7K|5|Very nice.
B005XEFADU|4|Happy Camper seems to be working great so far. Although, I did not get a 1oz plastic scoop with my container! I've had to estimate the amount I'm using. I am assuming I am using less than 1 oz since I have used it more than 18 times. Have used it from April to September in HOT temps and there is no odor. After dumping and rinsing black tank the sensors read 'Empty' which I hear a lot of people have problems with their sensors not reading properly. I will buy again!
B0009VIQ1A|2|It leaves an oily substance on the vehicle when using it, I have a Black truck so this causes me to have to polish the area again.
B003IS3HV0|3|Not bad but very messy and sticky.
B000E81VN8|5|Great product. Works as advertised. Does not slide around even with out being tied down or empty. Separators are easily re-arangeable. I bought a second.
B001VSGOAK|5|Product was excellent, even higher quality than expected.
B00D3PHUQ6|5|Very nice sweet 16 gift for granddaughter who just got driving permit. Wellade and good quality.
B000CMHVG2|3|It throws a bulb fault on a VW Toureg, but works just fine.  I picked this one as the datasheet and reviews said it works with LED trailer lights.  It works, but your car will still balk.
B013I7HHM0|5|Fast delivery and awesome quality
B013OB0EXO|5|I am really impressed with this product! I was very surprised at how bright the RGB ring was and the light it's self! I absolutely love working with them, they are super polite and respectful I will definitely be buying more products for my vehicle!!
B000FGBM8S|4|Comes in a 6 pack (obviously). They smell very good like vanilla (scent is called vanilla pride). They last a while if you leave them in the package with the amount taken out on the back. Basically, it instructs you to move the tree out of the bag an inch every week for maximum effectiveness, which is a bit of a hassle, other than that it looks great and smells amazing.
B00ZY1M8KK|5|Just as pictured
B00FGV037S|5|Worked great
B007AAUTG8|2|Very disappointed.  I feel I need a system to have it to show me whats behind me and how far away an object is once I get close to it.  The display is so fuzzy and washed out no matter how I adjust it, I can not make out if  an object is or if it is satationary or moving slowly.  The lines that should aid you in backing up for both distance and where you are headed do not work.  The side line that should show up as getting closed together the farther away they are instead getting farher apart.  This is because of how the fisheye lens distorts the view.  My wifes factory installed backip system is setup that way and therefore you know ho you are lined up where you backing.  The distance hash marks are useless because how the side diverge they are to farther apart to figuire out how far out you are.  The hash marks should be replace with lines going from side line to side line an you could get by with fewer of them.  I will be returning tthis system unless someone can tell how to correct these problens.
B0000AY69V|5|If you want your car polished, you've got it!
B011A18AK4|3|I didn't realize &#34;Porsche&#34; was plastered across the rear adjustment band.  Other that broadcasting &#34;Porsche&#34; the had is of good quality.
B009LOO1DS|5|Perfect match. Easy to install. Works better than the original ever did. Thanks!
B000EGAM0I|5|GREAT FOR ALL ENGINES TO PROTECT THE METAL PARTS
B002E387EM|5|worked perfectly shipped fast
B000M5Y72A|5|Awesome
B0002KO3BK|5|Exactly what it says it was and worked as well as it needed to.
B0064T4VTW|5|Worked
B000C7ZTTS|5|Exactly what it says it was and worked as well as it needed to.
B0013COVUO|4|Good tool for the price, worked good for setting pinion bearing preload on 12 bolt GM rear end ,  just wish they made it with 1/2 &#34; drive so you wouldn't have to use adapters.
B00J4N8Y3O|5|Worked as advertised - matched correct part number.
B00TODR110|5|These are great !  Sturdy, easy to install. Gone is that moment of fear when the boat comes out if the water.  You KNOW that you boat is centered.
B0024NWQZI|5|Works and went in the space as intended. Had to replace turn signal bulbs due to change in voltage but that was the only issue I had
B003L2ZVRG|3|Lose money on this but I understand this is the best on the market for leather.
B0023VGHRY|5|It was perfect
B007DMZCWE|5|I personally received this item very quick after ordering. And installed in about an hr with little confusion. The longest part was installing the fused line from the battery and routing it all the way back to the module. Still a lot less frustrating than splicing & guessing. Works great as expected!
B00HFWZ1NW|5|Nice
B0000AY2Z6|5|Boy, does this thing move some air! I put it on the step up to the bed in our truck camper, right in front of the &#34;pass through&#34; window and it cools the camper down quickly. It's really quite quiet too... great investment!
B00W2OSK7C|5|Fit perfectly and look great
B00KWNUC7Q|5|Great love it for my truck easy install and look good
B00PJPHEBO|5|Still not tested though. Will update after testing
B00407V43G|3|color is close.
B000E6PYR4|5|perfect fit for my 1982 Jeep CJ7 Limited.  As new.  Quick shipping. Good value!
B00FP0F85W|4|Very good
B000P6FBTO|5|Good stuff. Looks good on my scooter.
B008C0YD3U|2|Actually received the wrong product. Received a plexiglass rear windscreen instead. Decided to use it rather than return it, even though a corner of the plastic was broken qhen it arrived.
B00JQHFKWQ|5|Great windshield but a bitch to install.  The holes did not match up correctly.  Next time (if there is a next time) I would have a Polaris dealer install it.
B002VE3VHW|5|covers completely and is snug so the wind cant blow it off
B0006SH4GE|5|I have a convertible and love having the roof open as often as possible. Unfortunately in an urban environment and on highways, this means road grime accumulates on the leather seats, especially the rear seats, headrests, and the back deck/shelf. Over the 10+ years I've tried at least a dozen kinds of leather cleaners, surface cleaners, and other products recommended by car manufacturers and other websites. They sort of worked, but the amount of elbow grease required was substantial and always left me with a small mountain of filthy microfiber towels. Finally I caved and had detailers come to my house at the end of the summer and really clean the car. They used Meguiar's All Purpose cleaner diluted in spray bottles and like magic it cut through all the grime and left my rear seats looking brand new. It wasn't effortless, but when they were done they had used about 1/3 the number of microfiber towels and spent about 1/3 the time and the car was easily 3x as clean....like new on the entire surface. They also used this with a different dilution to clean the carpets and they removed all kinds of grime. I'm a convert! I'll probably use the detailers once in a while, but since I am an DIY person this cleaner is my new favorite.
B003VAYRNM|3|It works as it should.
B00099HVN6|5|Great battery for the price.  Have a 6V car electrical system so this is perfect.
B0013VT5N8|5|This has been on the car for a while now and still looks clear. no hazing or discoloration.
B0034ZUZM6|3|Poor instructions and schematic drawings.  It quit running in reverse a couple of days after I set it up.  I will eventually go back over it to determine, if I can, the cause for it not working in reverse.
B003TVN9PK|1|Really, really dim lighting. My application was running light on the back of my Honda Valkyrie. These were so dim I had to remove them. They are about half the light output of a 1.5 watt 74 base incandescent. I haven't seen an LED this dim since they first came out in the 80's. I can't imagine an application where they would be used.
B004LWVEKS|3|Just received my NOCO G3500. Nice looking unit.  I purchased this charger to use on two 6 volt AGM batteries that are due to arrive next week.  To run a test on the unit I attached it to my 12 volt AGM using the 12V COLD/AGM setting.  It looks like it is working fine.  BUT - I do not see a setting for 6V AGM.  The spec chart on the product page [[ASIN:B004LWVEKS NOCO Genius G3500 6V/12V 3.5A UltraSafe Smart Battery Charger]] shows that it will charge 6V AGM.  There is a review that says it will also.  But the unit does not appear to have a selection for 6V AGM and the manual does not list it either, just 6V Normal.  Will this unit safely charge 6V AGM?<br />If the G3500 will work for 6V AGM I will happily amend my rating from 3 stars to 5.  Without the 6V AGM option this is just another charger that I did not need and will return.
B00ENDPFKK|3|The color isn't as nice as other painted aluminum's out there I will probably buy a new set from a different manufacturer.
B00KVQJWSO|5|fit great an look like the original
B000DZKC6E|5|Fast delivery, as advertised, thanks
B00E9CZLF4|5|Really Nice
B00TOLYU48|5|It's solid and nice-looking and the orice is reasonable. I highly recommend it!
B00JAR6LXY|5|Awesome easy to install
B00AM0US14|5|a great price, 1 yr warrantee, perfect fit, they called my house before shipping to make sure I had ordered the right one,  AC works as good as new
B004SH2G9O|3|This hose is worth three stars. It did fix my power steering leak and it was affordable, comparatively. However the angle from the power steering pump was ever so slightly under bent and would not clear my engine head, which made the last two bolts (the two which connect the hose to the power steering pump) impossible to put in because of the misaligned hose. After having the hose almost completely installed, I had to remove it and put in in my vice to bend it just a tiny bit more. After that it installed fine and works perfectly.
B00NVVSI8Q|1|Pretty nice looks like a quality part. I have to change my review make sure you wear gloves they cut my hands up
B00IKSK5JK|5|Very Nice
B00GSAUHB8|1|This doesn't fit properly do not buy it
B002NAS444|5|Arrived quickly great product
B008E7TNM2|4|One week after installation and the product is working well, as expected. I had some complications due to the site being faulty. When I discovered the issue I brought it to the attention of the seller who was awesome. They went out of their way to pull my shipment before it went to the wrong address, and change it to the correct address.<br />The part was good/great. The seller was awesome!
B00OZ6S8MC|5|Worked perfectly on 2001 Cadillac DTS.  No more oil leak!
B0095TC6I6|4|These come off and on easily. They do shake a little but ok. Fits my Chevy Silverado.
B005N737P0|5|Nice sweatshirt. Keeps you warm and looks great.
B000BVRZ74|5|Just what I wanted
B007JEJQP0|5|this item was not for my car and i returned it
B000B68V6I|5|as expected
B003Z9RFLK|4|Really nice cover! For a good price!
B00OX2GLAY|3|very small sticker for the price its like a sticker you buy from a 25cent bubble gum machine
B001QZAMBA|5|Ordered this twice. I plan on ordering again after I find a place for the current one.  Bobaboey to you all.
B006Z907TY|1|Did not fit helicopter seat belts. :-(
B002MUV0HI|5|Sweet nice make the chrome out Busa look excellent when lights shining on the chrome
B0006O2RV0|5|Good product. fast service
B00CMUD8E6|5|Perfect fit. A lot cheaper than buying the part directly at the dealership! Best part is it is not aftermarket, it is the real deal OEM part!! Definitely ordering this again next time I'm due for a change!
B004AQZUX2|5|Works great!
B00EE259BA|4|Just ok
B001R5D66M|5|Perfect fit!
B004HCS4PK|5|Easy to apply and remove and gave an excellent showroom new shine.
B004JB3ARG|4|It fit
B008X02RIM|5|A great strut for my '96 SL2. I was a bit apprehensive of ordering these as I could not find many reviews on them. However, I did not want to deal with the hassle of disassembling my struts, compressing the springs, etc. These quick change struts are as easy as it gets. Seriously. It almost takes longer to jack up the car and take off the wheel than it does to replace these. I replaced the front struts in my car in under an hour, and that included multiple breaks in between. Granted, I had access to air tools, but it was still super easy. They came well packaged and installation was a breeze. Of course don't forget to get your front end aligned after you install these, as it's impossible to install them the exact same way the old ones were (And who's to say your old ones weren't already out of alignment).<br /><br />I've been meaning to write a review on these, but can happily say I've had them for about 4 months now with about 4,000 miles on them and not a single squeak or anything to be heard from them while turning, going over bumps, etc.
B005YP38EQ|2|not one looking for
B00KTI9UQ8|5|It works great. I was always replacing the battery in my other one.
B00TSSR1YS|5|I bought these as a gift for my boyfriend for his truck. Official Mopar product. Great packaging and timely delivery. I'm sure my man is going to love these. That's for a great product.
B0064RD47E|3|Comfortable but loses its fit through only short time of using.
B0019FDKU2|1|Not axle mount style as described. Would not work for my bike. No directions with product.
B003NI1H5I|5|Perfect. The party was right, the shipping was quick, the ordering was easy!
B00D3298A0|4|Good value. Car will smell like rubber for a while.
B00WPHZ9CU|5|My husband retired from military service, ordered the item for him, very pleased with it and he was extremely happy to place it on his vehicle. Excellent price, great service and priceless gift, will definitely recommend to friends. Thanks!
B00IA3UJ78|5|This is just an awesome retro ashtray. I like stinking up my patio and dumping ashes in it with a fat cigar. I could not be happier.
B000VLF9NQ|5|Easy on and off! Great protection from the elements when I don't put the hard top on.
