B00PJ5AUCO|5|THIS GAME IS AWWWWWSSSSOOOOMMMEEE. I peed my pants  when it was installing. It's so scary when golden freddy crashes your game. I always turn the sound down before playing it
B00MO21WAY|5|So enjoyed this. I hope that there is another season.
B0084AXZK0|4|A classic book that is still powerful today.
B003YFIUW8|5|After hearing real life stories of women kidnapped and having children by their captors it was interesting to see how life is for them afterwards....there are so many things that we take for granted in life.
B00AREIAI8|4|Fun to play. Easy to learn the controls. A lot like the game Horsez, and Horsez2. Horse lovers will like it.
B006WXHJGC|5|Good BD, fast delivery
B0001V6ZJ8|5|great classic movie
B00KFVE4B0|5|Was fun and intense
B00RNRD8RA|4|Hillarious!!!
B009UX2YAC|5|It was really good. I think it was than the original one even though not that much! But, I like the movie rio that enticed me to get the app. I give it 5 stars
B00004YRQA|5|If there's one thing I can say about the 8MB Memory Card, it's this: you're going to use it.  A lot.  Let's face it - almost all of the games currently out for PS2 have some kind of save feature.  From Grand Theft Auto to Gran Turismo, you'll want to save your game.  So basically, you need a memory card.  The only question that remains is which card to buy - and I picked this one.  Sony's card is the most reliable, it's the most durable, and it's designed by Sony to work with Sony's Playstation 2.  What more can you say?  Yes, it's a bit expensive, but it's just as much an investment as any game.  And it's as essential as the controller.  Buy this product if you haven't already.
B0044IJ1S6|5|Finally a Blu-Ray set of Depeche Mode Live with lots of music videos and other extras.  One concern there doesn't seem to be a deluxe Blu-Ray set including the 2 CD's like there is for the deluxe DVD which includes the 2 CD's.  Depeche Mode are one of my favorite bands going back to their first released song Photographic on the Some Bizzare Collection.      I was so happy with all of the remastered 5.1 sets of each of their albums.  The remixing of vocals and instrumentation brought you deeper inside the songs while maintaining the integrity of the original vinyl recording.  Most importantly the original CD release of albums like Music For The Masses and Violator were mastered so badly, it detracted from the genius of the songs.  The 5.1 remasters Got The Balance Right !!!    I hope they will re-release all of their live concerts and videos in Blu-Ray, not just from the improved picture quality but most importantly for the sound.
B00P7PJ9P0|3|It was a great re-telling of a old tale. The actor that played the king was a terrible performance.
B008P1EWIM|5|Use it all the time.
B009U9S6FI|5|Read this book for a Theology class (not necessarily a religious book) and the gripping poignant story line in Part I and explanation of Logotherapy in Part II are very compelling and resourceful. One I will read over and reference many times.
B0089EHWQE|5|This was a great read. It was witty and endearing with characters that grabbed your heart strings from the start. It made me laugh out loud and cry. I would highly recommend this book.
B00FR88VTC|1|It crashes every time after taking a photo scan of the document.
B007HACDLK|5|What a great read. Mitch Rapp is on fire. This book keeps your blood pumping and you can't wait to get to the next page and see what happens next.
B000000993|5|Thank you!

B000002U94|5|Detroit rocker Bob Seger and his Silver Bullet Band released its second live album entitled Nine Tonight in September of 1981.<br />Nine Tonight was Seger's thirteenth album in total. I think that this live album is just as good, if not better than the first live album, 1976's Live Bullet (which saw a young, hungry Seger prior to stardom whereas Nine Tonight captures him at the height of his success with the #1 album Against the Wind).<br />Half of Nine Tonight, like Live Bullet, was recorded at the legendary Cobo Hall in Detroit, MI (tracks 4, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14) in June of 1980 and the album's other eight tracks (tracks 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 15 and 16) were recorded at the long demolished Boston Garden in my native Boston, MA back in October, 1980 and mixed at Bayshore Recording Studios in Florida by Bill Szymczyk (who produced albums for The Eagles, Joe Walsh, J Geils Band and The Who).<br />Seger is joined by longtime Silver Bullet members bass player Chris Campbell and sax player Alto Reed (both of whom are still in the band today) and guitarist Drew Abbott (whom would leave The Silver Bullet Band during The Distance sessions in 1982). There were some changes to The Silver Bullet Band lineup since Live Bullet. First, drummer Charlie Allen Martin was paralyzed in a car accident in 1977 and was replaced by David Teegarden (whom would also leave the band after Nine Tonight's release). Second, keyboard player Robyn Robbins was replaced in 1980 by ex-Grand Funk Railroad keyboard player Craig Frost (whom made his debut on Nine Tonight and is still in The Silver Bullet Band today).<br />The only two exclusive tracks on Nine Tonight is the opening title cut which was from the movie \\"Urban Cowboy\\" released in 1980. The track was intended for Against the Wind but the producer for the \\"Urban Cowboy\\" soundtrack album (Eagles manager Irving Azoff) had the song ready for inclusion on the album (UC). Then we segue into the album's biggest hit \\"Tryin' To Live My Life Without You\\" which is a great song.<br />Nine Tonight also features blistering live versions of tracks from Seger's three million sellers 1976's Night Moves (represented by \\"Mainstreet\\", \\"The Fire Down Below\\", the title cut to Night Moves and \\"Rock and Roll Never Forgets\\"), 1978's Stranger in Town (represented by \\"Hollywood Nights\\", \\"Old Time Rock and Roll\\", \\"Feel Like a Number\\" and \\"We've Got Tonight\\") and 1980's chart topper Against the Wind (represented by \\"You'll Accomp'ny Me', the album's title cut, his ode to Jane Fonda \\"Her Strut\\", \\"Fire Lake\\" and \\"Betty Lou's Gettin' Out Tonight\\").<br />We end the album, like Live Bullet, with \\"Let it Rock\\". This version is more electrifying than on the Live Bullet version clocking in at over 10 plus minutes. The CD however features an edited version because otherwise, it would have been believed back in 1989, that the track would exceed the maximum playing time on a CD or it would have become a 2 CD set (CDs can fit up to 80 minutes of music). The LP label gave Let it Rock's playing time as 8 minutes and 26 seconds but it is actually 10 minutes and 35 seconds. The CD version is only a little over 6 minutes and uses the ending of The Fire Down Below to end the track instead of the big finale so that's my only gripe about the CD (I hope a remastered CD is released soon with the full version like on the original LP, cassette and 8-track issues).<br />Nine Tonight was released to massive sales and the album peaked at #3 on the Billboard album charts and sold millions upon release. The album deserves to be re-released in its full glory and can fit on one CD no problem or worse comes to worse, re-release it on two (I'll be a first day buyer).<br />Highly recommended!ch is a great song.   Nine Tonight also features blistering live versions of tracks from Seger's three million sellers 1976's Night Moves (represented by \\"Mainstreet\\", \\"The Fire Down Below\\", the title cut to Night Moves and \\"Rock and Roll Never Forgets\\"), 1978's Stranger in Town (represented by \\"Hollywood Nights\\", \\"Old Time Rock and Roll\\", \\"Feel Like a Number\\" and \\"We've Got Tonight\\") and 1980's chart topper Against the Wind (represented by \\"You'll Accomp'ny Me', the album's title cut, his ode to Jane Fonda \\"Her Strut\\", \\"Fire Lake\\" and \\"Betty Lou's Gettin' Out Tonight\\").

B00746O3X8|4|I love this it made caring my cameras and lenses much easier.  It was simple to connect, very easy to put on and comfortable.
B00DBSZEH2|3|The film is exactly as advertised...fun, mindless and violent. It won't ever win any awards, but you won't fall asleep either!
B00GX598FO|1|Plot was contrived and really hard to follow. It did not make a lot of sense. Bad acting. Just horrible.
014241011X|4|How fun is Roald Dahl?!  He is, to my mind, without a doubt one of the most imaginative human beings to ever live.  He manages to write children's books that adults also love; books that are best categorized as \\"odd\\" yet also somehow timeless and classic.  [[ASIN:014241011X The Witches]] is one that I had actually never read as a child - I picked it up at a used book sale recently and decided it was long past time I read it.  And I was not disappointed.  Dahl has a rare gift - the ability to turn an adult into a child again simply through the use of words.  He paints his world so evocatively - his descriptions of the trials and tribulations of being a more-than-usually-clever child trapped in a more-than-usually-challenging adult world make it possible for even the most grown-up grown up to remember what it is to be small and uncertain and reliant on others.  I, for one, will never look at \\"ordinary women\\" entirely the same again...
B00005J6UP|5|I have loved this movie for the longest time. I remember watching it as a kid and I always watch it when I get the chance. However, VHS became out of style and ours broke. So I never bought the DVD and secretly hoped I would get it as a gift but I decided to buy it. Great 80s movie, funny, adventurous. Anyway, the movie came in really fast. I ordered three movies at the same time from different sellers and this one actually came first but they were all pretty fast. I received this movie just as described and even though its used it looks as though its never been used.
B00FAVRHBE|5|A absolutely fantastic Doctor Who 50th anniversary special and can't wait to watch it again in 3D. The Day of the Doctor price isn't bad in my opinion if you consider it a movie link episode of Doctor Who that comes in a 3d Blu ray / Blu ray / DVD combo.
B006GWO5NE|4|Although I was disappointed that I need to spend $25 to fix a technical design flaw with her Kindle, I am please so far with the new plug and adapter that was designed to overcome the flaw in the charging units on her Kindle Fire.  I recommend to anyone out there to try these adapters before disposing of their Kindle.  We've had them for a week and so far so good.
072325804X|5|I gave this as a gift at a baby shower. The parents had requested it, and I chose it because these were my favorite stories as a child. The product includes a beautiful slipcover/case, which makes the presentation really lovely. If you want to give a book for a gift, this is a great choice!
B00DR0PDNE|5|This product chromecast is very useful because you can movie in you tv through streaming media player, very good item.

B00A6CCF0K|4|A nice refresher to fans of The Shining.  I kept going back to the original to check out the characters.
0345455681|4|I liked it.

B0083Z6AH6|5|I love it!!
B00001OH7G|5|This is just a great cd if you have a love for great guitar work,and blues rock music.This is probably one of rory finest cd`s and his best live cd.This has the fantastic acoustic song as the crow flies.You have to check out that guitar work,not many people could play a guitar like that,and you will not find anybody in these new bands that like to play all glowm &amp; doom music.If you want one great cd,buy this and you will wear it out,i promise.
B007HIEBV2|5|Very cool sound mixing 1930's and 40's jazz with an electronica/dance sound. Definitely a great addition to any music collection.
1400086035|5|Jim Dale is a very fine oral interpreter, it is a skill to read some of the most beloved books and make people love them more and discover something new.<br /><br />This is a 3 disc set of A Christmas Carol, audio version and Jim Dale gives each character its own unique voice and he is pleasant to listen to and he adds charm, warmth and humor to this very well known story.<br /><br />Treat your self, treat your family.  We will be listening to this during our holiday traveling.

B000CNESU8|5|Show a remarkable prescience for a 1976 movie, Paddy Chayefsky's brutal satire of the television nation in the not so distant future still stings the eyes. Faye Dunaway's cutthroat executive was talking reality TV almost a quarter century before [[ASIN:B0001ZDKXI Survivor's First Season]] and Peter Finch's satirical Howard Beale was the sociopathic nutjob who would eventually turn up as \\"journalists\\" like Michael Savage or Billo The Clown. \\"Network\\" was one of the first movies to win multiple Academy Awards for its actors (Finch, Dunaway and Beatrice Straight, supporting actress as William Holden's long suffering wife) plus Chayefsky's screenplay.<br /><br />Some 30 years later and the points \\"Network\\" makes still drill home. The fact that you could still make this movie today and have it be just as ruthlessly efficient speaks of its brilliance. After all, what makes \\"The Mao-Tse Tung Hour\\" all that different than a season of Jack Bauer and [[ASIN:B000MR8W92 24]]on Fox? (Even more to the point, \\"Network\\" was made when the idea of a 4'th Network other than ABC, NBC or CBS was considered ludicrous.) When Dunaway berates a news executive over his \\"sanctity of the news department,\\" she pile drivers him thusly:<br /><br />\\"I watched your 6 o'clock news today; it's straight tabloid. You had a minute and a half of that lady riding a bike naked in Central Park; on the other hand, you had less than a minute of hard national and international news. It was all sex, scandal, brutal crime, sports, children with incurable diseases, and lost puppies. So, I don't think I'll listen to any protestations of high standards of journalism when you're right down on the streets soliciting audiences like the rest of us.\\"<br /><br />Does her take on the future sound eerily like 2008? The fact is, we have long since moved to the point where the journalist is the story and the certifiable Howard Beale is golden, at least until his instability threatens his advertising stream. While that leads to the no-longer far-fetched conclusion, it also give Ned Beatty a hilariously over the top moment that briefly steals the movie. Beatty's nominated role as Head Honcho Arthur Jensen seems like Ted Turner before he became a broadcast mogul...there are so many predictions in \\"Network\\" that it seems like it came backwards in time.<br /><br />Movies influenced by \\"Network\\": [[ASIN:0780622561 Wag the Dog]], [[ASIN:B000CEXEWA All the President's Men]], [[ASIN:B0001932ZA The Running Man]].ched conclusion, it also give Ned Beatty a hilariously over the top moment that briefly steals the movie.

0140386335|4|A book that both parent and child will enjoy. The grammar and sentence syntax is easy to follow for reading aloud, and the story plot is very fascinating. It's a bit gritty at times for young kids so expect to edit a little here and there.<br /><br />I gave it four stars rather than five because of the iffy morality displayed in the book. You don't have a clear good and evil in the book, and Atreyu is told not to make any judgements, despite the fact that he's forced to do such repeatedly  (such as whether or not &#34;Urgl the Many&#34; is trustworthy in it's promise). This &#34;non-judgement&#34; sort of thing is not liveable, which is something I'm teaching my children as I read to them.<br /><br />If this seems like a petty issue to you, just remember that you don't want your kids remembering the concept of &#34;don't judge&#34; when the toothless guy in the van invites your kid inside for candy and cartoons alone.<br /><br />Four stars for a good book, we are really enjoying it otherwise.
1400052181|4|Offers lots of insight in laymen's terms into cell and genetic research...might well be considered a history of that research told against the backdrop of a previously unknown donor and her family, the effects the study of their mother's cells had on their lives over the years.    Interesting format, very well done, mixing science with humanity in appropriate and readable mixes....But...    How many times do you have to say virtually the same thing in a different way?  Book begins to feel repetitious about halfway through...But it is a good and worthwhile read.    There is some slight sense from midpoint on that Mrs. Skloot is imposing today's standards of medical privacy and research on a time when such expectations and laws did not exist.     That's a dangerous and judgemental thing to do...it's hinted at, but not overly done.
B00KA87GCW|5|Love the charecters

0385493622|4|I wanted to learn about Fermat's Last Theorem (FLT) and its proof by Andrew Wiles.  This book presents FLT and its 350-year history in an accessible way; however, the quality of the writing could definitely be improved.  It does not give any technical detail, but covers enough material for the lay reader to appreciate the path to FLT's proof.  It is also a short story of Andrew Wiles's life as it relates to FLT and his proof of it.  It describes Wiles's passion about FLT from an early age, his doctoral research and study of elliptic curves, and his devotion to proving FLT during eight years (1986-1994) of his life.  Although the book is filled with interesting facts, the pace of events toward FLT's proof picks up only in the last third of the book.  This is where the Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture is introduced followed by contributions of other mathematicians including Wiles.  I really like the author's narrative in this book, but more editing would make the book even better.
B000056K04|2|I am a huge fan of DMB. Who knows Dave, mabey you're reading this. I have been to numerous concerts and this band has always managed to keep the same groovy sound. After purchasing &quot;Under the Table...&quot;, &quot;Crash&quot;, and &quot;Before These Crowded Streets&quot;, I could put in the album and listen to it all the way through. I find myself constantly skipping through songs on &quot;Everyday&quot;. The only 3 songs I would consider listening to again are &quot;I Did It&quot;, &quot;The Space Between&quot;, and &quot;Angel&quot;. There is little (if any acoustic guitar) and no instrumental solos. I would release a live album quick just to overshadow this one. Dave, take my advise and go back to the basics with your next album......
6305075492|2|Before beginning to write this review I read a couple of the previous reviews, and one person said something that summed up my thoughts quite well. You Tim Burton fans will see stuff here that was obviously a large influence on him. Specifically, the sets. You can imagine movie-goers of that era feeling as if they were seeing an alternate world as they watched this movie.<br /><br />I think my thoughts on this movie will differ from those of most of the reviewers, though. I think the sets and the look of the characters are the most interesting things about this movie. Is it actually from 1921, though? On the VHS I have, it says \\"released in 1919\\" right on the box. Beyond that, the camerawork and production values seem to be quite a bit less than the those of many other films from the early '20s.<br /><br />This movie has its moments, but if you really want to see a movie from the early '20s that is psychotic and strange even by many of today's standards, try Haxan, from 1922. For those of you who think Dr. Caligari or the flying monkeys scene from Wizard of Oz are creepy or scary, you will be utterly horrified by Haxan. Haxan is a movie that couldn't have been made by American studios until probably the late '60s... and lots of people still would have been outraged even then, I'm sure.<br /><br />Haxan has better cinematography and production values, and every aspect of it is more twisted and evil than anything in Caligari. Plus the acting is alot better. Caligari is worthy as an historical artifact and for its influence, but Haxan is better in every single way. There are things in Caligari that are laughably bad or just boring. Haxan is a twisted masterpiece of evil and perversion, and worthy of many more viewings.<br /><br />Having said this, if you are really into Dr. Caligari, Mark Dresser (incredible bassist, improvisor, composer) released a music cd of the same name. His The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari is available on this website in the music section.<br />  <br />
B000MCH5P4|5|I rarely find movies I enjoy.  Very often they are so predictable or similar to all the other movies of the same genre.  I loved this.  Great acting, storyline interesting and gripping.  I loved the settings of the Moroccan village and desert, the stories of the Moroccan families.  Really worth watching.
B004DK5CW4|5|Found it to be both entertaining not only the equine but the emotional side of both the family and the people in the industry.<br /><br />I was 21 when Secretariat won the triple crown. It was wonderful to go back to that time and get a real feel of what was behind the scenes.

0307719774|5|This is so fun!  I look forward to filling it out each day.  It's got a great mix of serious and silly questions.  It's actually pretty small; it looks like a big book, but it's easily portable.  Would make  great gift.
0375847227|5|This book incorporated three stories - The Golden Compass, The Subtle Knife, and The Amber Spyglass.  I brought the books with me on vacation, on the recommendation of a friend who reads a lot of (and teaches) adolescent literature, a genre I haven't touched in 20 years.  I was really impressed with the stories - the themes of freedom, adventure, innocence/experience, stewardship, friendship - it was an amazing trilogy.  I recommend it.
B003ODIZL6|5|I wrote this review bcuz I hate this book cuz its a dictionary for Americans  and that's dumb bcuz people have to buy it but you can go 2 the library and borrow it

B008UCJ7KO|5|I LOVE this series and I thought this book was the best one yet!! Before I purchased I saw a lot of bad reviews and thought how is it even possible to have a bad book about ace and angel!! But I recommend to ignore them because it was amazing! We finally get to see them happy and together and they learn how to face their demons together!<br /><br />I am soo glad there are two more books in this series because I am not ready for it to be over!! A lot of questions were answered but there is more to find out! Can't wait!!  If you are a true fan you will LOVE it!! :)
B00V4JJFN4|5|Loved it!!
B0015XHQTE|5|Clint Eastwood had always been someone I enjoyed watching in the movies. His characters are a little rough sometimes, but I do not remember him ever using bad language and that means a lot to me. I just wanted a few good ones to remember him by, and I think the Dirty Harry series is pretty typical of him.
B00DKY4LBW|5|It's brilliant. Need I really say more? Just go out and buy this, especially if you consider yourself a fan.
B00D3LA5WG|5|Delivered as promised. We were pleasantly surprised when we played this DVD. For the price we were expecting a mediocre movie. The show was quite enjoyable and we consider it a very good value. Of course one needs to consider the fact that Matthew McConaughey maintains quite an elevated position in this household!
B00EY8ARYS|2|This is a huge disappointment thus far!!! It is poorly directed, poorly written, and has extremely weak sets! This great set of actors have obviously been provided with very weak material and a lack of guidance by a poor director who attempts to hide his weak sets by frequent close ups. The dialogue is also extremely stilted, making this very difficult to watch. I couldn't finish the second episode. But, hey, it's still early. Let's hope someone pulls a rabbit out of his or her hat and fixes this weak and already dying series. Good Luck! As for all the five star ratings - someone must be getting paid to praise this sow's ear.
B004SJ3BCI|3|I really don't understand how to use it.Could you send ne instructions.It looks like a fun game to play<br />for me.

B00ECU34ZM|4|Oblivion has a great premise and a well casted film.    This movie has dimension where most sci-fi action flicks lack. The plot is simple but very well told with great action along the way.    I felt the tension from Cruise's character with his redhead girlfriend who lived with him on the sky platform. The story unfolds nicely when he accidentally stumbles onto the ravager's hideout. From there the movie starts moving at a good pace leading up to revealing who or what is actually controlling the Terra-formers.     It was well acted for what it was and the movie kept you interested long enough to the end.
B009Y61ZMI|5|Awesome!

B000000W5L|5|Of all the classic Stones' albums, \\"Exile on Main Street\\" showcases Keith Richards' creativity.  Richards provides memorable guitar hooks (\\"Rocks Off,\\" \\"Tumbling Dice,\\" \\"Happy,\\" \\"Soul Survivor\\"), plays terrific bass (\\"Casino Boogie,\\" \\"Happy,\\" and \\"Soul Survivor\\") and even his vocals are above reproach.  \\"Exile\\" was made before too many drugs and cigarettes turned his voice into the raspy croak that one hears on later recordings.  One reason that \\"Exile\\" is predominately his is because most of it was developed and recorded at the villa he was renting in southern France, and Jagger (who had just wed Bianca) was only present periodically.  Mick Taylor and Charlie Watts were around for the most part (Bill Wyman was not) and Richards and Taylor guitar playing meshes better on \\"Exile\\" than any other Stones album.  Gram Parsons was also around at the villa, and his influence, if not his voice (no one can tell from the murky backup vocals) can be heard on \\"Sweet Virginia\\" and \\"Torn and Frayed.\\"<br />The sound quality of the production is cetainly not crystal clear and the lyrics are, to put it mildly, muddled (even for a Stones album), but the energy is incredible.  My personal favorite is \\"Torn and Frayed,\\" which features an incredible steel guitar performance by Al Perkins, permeating a song that resonates with what seems at times resignation to a decadent lifestyle, but also celebration of the creation of music that transcends that lifestyle.  The song captures where the Stones were in 1972:  sinking from all of the excess but still making music that escaped from the destruction.<br />There are many other great moments as well.  \\"Rip This Joint\\" features great piano from the late Nicky Hopkins and a great sax from Bobby Keys.  Richards' bass playing on \\"Casino Boogie\\" is hypnotic and Hopkins shows why he was one of the best rock pianists of the era on \\"Let It Loose.\\"  \\"Tumbling Dice\\" and Richards' \\"Happy\\" are justifiably famous.  Of all the many songs (this was a doublealbum), the only one I really don't care for is \\"Just Wanna See His Face,\\" which probably sounded better when it was recorded, apparently under the influence of some mind-altering substance.<br />My only major complaint concerns the packaging.  If one compares the Rolling Stones' catalog of CD's with those of other major (or even not so major) groups from their era, one has to be disappointed that the Stones' CD's lack liner notes that provide a historical perspective of the particular album and its tracks.  Sony/Columbia has done a wonderful job repackaging the Byrds' albums, providing much new information and including bonus tracks to all their albums.  Same thing with MCA and the Who CD's; \\"Live at Leeds\\" in CD form is far superior to the original vinyl product.  \\"Exile,\\" like the other Stones CD's, comes with reproductions of the original album art and song credits, which were never all that impressive to begin with.  It even has minature photos of the postcards that came with the original vinyl album --- now the totally incoherent commentary on the postcards can be read only with magnification.  One can only hope that someday that the Stones and their management will reissue their works with some written commentary and bonus tracks that will enhance the original product.

B00B7FOQCK|5|Edit:  This usb 3.0 splitter works just as you would expect it too.  The first one I got must have been a lemon.  The ports didn't line up correctly and made it hard to plug into the device.  But their customer service team contacted me right away and sent me a new one for free, now I no longer have a problem plugging in any usb cables.      I must say that I do like the sleek look of the usb hub, the black with blue lights on either side do add a nice touch to the unit.
B00NEQRNVG|5|I have been waiting for what seemed like ages for this book and, when I got my hands on a copy, I just couldn’t put it down. The first three books built up the relationship of Gideon and Eva from Eva’s point of view so it was quite one-sided. I kept wondering when Gideon would get his turn to explain himself, and he got to in “Captivated By You.”<br /><br />The book opens with Gideon and Eva fresh from their elopement. The happily-ever-after didn’t manifest for these two as problems just rained down on them. Their marriage gets tested every step of the way, forcing them to confront each other’s personal issues that they weren’t ready to face just yet. The confrontation is much harder for Gideon because he keeps things to himself despite Eva’s constant urging to open up to her – or to their therapist at least. He takes things too far and ends up almost losing Eva who is the only one who keeps him going. Despite his spectacular f**k ups, I couldn’t help still rooting for him because, hey, he’s just trying to keep Eva from getting hurt again.<br /><br />Sylvia Day could have written a typical kiss-and-make-up ending but it wouldn’t have gone well with the tone she had set for Gideon and Eva’s relationship. The book was one huge emotional roller coaster ride that had me expecting the worst for the couple but in the end, they sort things out the Gideon and Eva way (Yes, they’ve still got it even though they’re married).<br /><br />For me, “Captivated By You” is the best book of the series so far. I am already looking forward to the fifth book “One With You.”

0743490304|4|After enjoying The Davinci Code I was interested, like most people, to see what else Dan Brown had to offer. Deception Point is the only other book of his that I've read, and I must say, I enjoyed it. You can say what you want about wild, unbelievable plot lines, but whatever you want to call it, Dan Brown weaves it together in such a way that makes the book difficult to put down.<br />The jacket of the book keeps most of the plot line hidden, so I'll do the same in this review. Basically, the novel starts with NASA making a major scientific discovery in the polar ice cap. Certain experts are called in to verify it, and from there we travel on an adventure encompassing geology, astrophysics, political science, marine biology, elite special forces - you name it, it's probably in here - yet the novel doesn't feel crammed with useless facts. He manages to use it all to enrich the plot.<br />The praises are the fast pacing, great tension in practically every scene, characters with interesting histories, and unbelievable research depth. The intricacy with which he covers such things as special forces units and scientific issues rival Clancy and Crichton.<br />Lastly, my biggest criticism with Brown is his dialogue. The Davinci Code was better, but there are moments in Deception Point that are staggeringly awful. Astrophysicists don't say things like \\"Bite me, virgin boy.\\" He had a group of the world's most esteemed scientific researchers speaking to each other like teenagers at a mall.<br />If you like Crichton or Clancy, I can recommend this book to you with confidence. I think Brown is establishing himself as a long-running novelist in the elite ranks of popular fiction writers, and Deception Point is certainly a step in that direction.
B0086700CM|4|game is a great way to keep kids busy. Also interesting for adults as well. could us different variation of mazes but other than that its a great game.
B00E8KLWB4|4|Cool
B002ZG98J6|4|This is a great movie.  Yes, it's different from the book, but don't let that keep you from watching it.  Both young and old will enjoy this movie.  There is humor in it for both adults and kids.  It is very entertaining and never a dull moment.    Now that being said, do not buy this on Blu-ray.  I bought this from SunCoast, and the blu-ray disc will not play.  I went through and made sure my player software was up to date and it still wouldn't play.  I took it back and got a replacement.  But again the blu-ray disc would not play.  Ihe DVD disc plays fine.  This is a great movie and I recommend buying it, but get the DVD version.   Do not waste your money on the Blu-ray.

B004GHNIRK|4|This story of a poverty stricken man sentenced to years of imprisonment for the theft of a loaf of bread in the 19th century resonates with me as an Australian convict descendant. Like my ancestors from Britain and Ireland, Hugo’s character in France, Jean Valjean, has the opportunity to turn his life around, not through a Ticket of Leave in a new country but through an act of kindness.<br /><br />The novel’s overall message of the goodness and beauty of human nature is an appealing one. Hugo opens the readers’ eyes to what is important in human interaction. He shows us that people are forced to become what they are by the rules and expectations of society which imprisons people even when there are no prison bars.  Characters are stripped of the labels stamped on them by a judgemental society. For example, Valjean sees Fantine not as the prostitute she has forced to become but as a woman and a mother, a mother desperate to be reunited with her daughter. Instead of condemning her and taking advantage of her vulnerable situation Valjean respects her and helps her.<br /><br />For those who are daunted by the prospect of reading one of the longest novels ever written it might be useful to approach it as five novels (1: Fantine 2: Cosette 3: Marius 4: Saint-Denis 5:Jean Valjean) and settle down to read one novel at a time.<br />Each volume is a leisurely narrative that includes lengthy descriptions of characters, settings, conditions and events; a narrative that wanders off onto tracks that don’t appear to have any connection with the plot which I found annoying and  frustrating .<br /><br />Such a book as Les Miserables deserves a longer review than I have time for. To summarise, it is a story of the human condition, of love, loss and hope, of French society in the 1800s, and it is a plea for social justice.<br /><br />Those who are like me and enjoy reading Dickens are likely to enjoy Les Miserables.<br />.
B00B0IILHA|5|awesome features, one of the best sets yet
B000O8OTNC|5|Works as advertised and was a fantastic investment.  Keeping this thing handy is a must for anyone who carries a knife every day.  I may even purchase one or two more so I can keep one in the car and maybe have one laying around my shop.  Well worth the low cost.

B00HGJ18C2|5|So easy to. play and kills time.  time while waiting  for someone or an appointment.
B00873GRU4|4|I can give this book 4 stars.<br />The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was the author's propensity for drawn out descriptions of settings and/or characters' actions and some of the characters which I thought would carry through to the end were killed off early in the story.<br />I've never read anything by this author before and I found the writing excellent and  the plot compelling with well-developed believable characters.<br /> Claustrophobia and dread permeates the opening chapters and you can sense the oppression and the subjugation. This is a society without free will; people are just worker drones going about their daily routine with no questions asked. If they dare ask questions about going outside, they are suited up and send outside into the toxic atmosphere to clean the lenses and end up dying almost immediately after they finish the cleaning.<br />The fact that even though the silo-144 stories deep into the earth connected by a long spiral staircase-has advanced technology, it lacked an elevator. This at first, was hard to get my head around but when I realized that this was a device designed to keep people in their place be it below ground where all the workers existed, or above ground where the hierarchy lived it made sense.<br />The people live and die trapped inside this silo. They are told the atmosphere is toxic and the land is ruined. The small community is separated, with the farmers and mechanics in the lower third,  information-technology workers in the heart of the structure and the leaders and law makers in the upper level. All wear color-coded uniforms. Everyone must abide by rigid sets of rules from the number of children to the number and kinds of pets they are allowed.<br />I did like Juliette, the main character, though I would have liked it if the author introduced her sooner in the story, and followed her struggles to the ending which wasn't an ending at all as you need to read the next two books to find out what happens.<br />If you enjoy downbeat sci fi and dystopian with a touch of steam punk, then Wool is for you.<br /><br />I belong to a book club at the local library and this was the book of the month to read. I borrowed it from the library.<br /><br />Review by O. N. Stefan.

B0076I624W|5|I know a lot of people don't think these are Brad Pitts or Anthony Hopkins bet movies, I kind of disagree.  These two actors just make this movie so much greater than it should have been.  The story and characters are not the greatest thing since sliced bread but just an average story.  Some how these two together make it so much more.
0316666343|5|It would be hard to imagine a better book than this little jewel. It will be around for a very long time and I thank the author for a dazzling trip.
0307887448|1|This book had so many great reviews and it sounded like a lot of fun! I really loved Ender's Game and I thought it may be similar to that.  However, the 80's references are obnoxious and they were out of place.  The author interrupted the storyline to make incredibly long 80's references and it just felt like the author was trying was too hard to bring back the 80's.<br /><br />I might try to finish it one day, but as far as I'm concerned, there are much better books out there that are worth my time!
B005MYWZIO|2|Mr. Kiwanuka's CD is a pleasant surprise in today's non-melodic world of music. Nice to listen to - but comparisons to Bill Withers and the Big O? - give me a break. The only valid comparison I can think of is Terry Callier
B00992CF6W|5|it's worth 6.99$. Great game it's cool how you can connect with friends
B002VRZEYM|2|I thought this was a 2 star film, it had some decent information. I like how they went into one of the farms and showed the over weight chickens that could hardly move. It does suck how the animals are treated but I will continue to eat the foods because what else can you do.
B00KIZ9F8K|5|If you are a long time fan of Tom Petty, or even a casual fan like myself, you will enjoy this album. Outstanding songwriting, melody, and musicianship. A straight forward rock album from a veteran artist and band.

B004XJRQUQ|1|The book was amazing .It was the best book I have ever read. I do not really like that Prim died.
B00JRH6KMO|2|It's a nice game, but it's flawed by a terrible control system. I find the controls non responsive, the shooting system rather bad. It's a shame, since the game itself is a nice one. Shall wait for an update, maybe they'll fix this issue.
B00005JMEW|5|There is no such thing as an original thought, unless it is taking stuff that's already been done and turning into something else, and to me, Tarantino is a master at this.  To me, this movie was so original(it is true that I have not seen the source material).  I thought the originality never flagged, and that I was truly watching the work of a person who knows and loves films.  This is high praise from me as I normally am not the hugest fan of hype, and Tarantino carries his hype around with him. I am also not a fan of gratuitous violence. I loved this movie.<br />As For the movie<br />I once saw Tarantino in the Burbank airport.  I got in a conversation with him and he was&quot;flying to Mexico to shoot his movie&quot;. The movie was called Kill Bill, and then he and I got on the same airplane.  He came across affably, a charming, funny guy.  I guess I might've been scared being on the airplane with the maker of Kill Bill if I had seen it.  This is a film of unadulterated revenge.  A woman is so set on revenge that she must fight armies of people to get to her goal.  Uma Thurman turns in such a wonderfully focused performance.  The other thing is that her intensity really motivates the gallons of blood.  She is a greek tragic figure whose horrifying acts are justified by her loss.  This is Medea, Titus Andronicus, and Switchblade Sisters all in one.<br /> and the work of everyone is so fantastic.(I am waiting to see Darryl Hannah get hers).  But the blood flows almost ridiculously.  Ultimately this is shakespearean, greek, grand opera, and 70's exploitation all in one.<br />And for all those of you who are complaining that this is not original,  I am not sure what you want.  To me, this is a hybrid of anime,(which I am not a fan of, but I thought it was beautiful and disgusting)pop culture, westerns, samurai movies and the value systems of those with no morals.  And you can never peg it.  Just when you think it is going a certain way, it shifts on you...sending you swirling into another style.<br />I really expected that I would not like this film, and I cannot wait to see part 2.  I can't wait to see what Tarantino has up his sleeve for usswirling into another style.<br />I really expected that I would not like this film, and I cannot wait to see part 2.

B008469DGY|4|I think I've summed up the game in the four words of my review.  It's not golf, and that's the one knock I can see people having, as anyone thinking they've ordered a golf game will be sorely disappointed.  That said, the mechanic of trying to flick an object into a goal (a reskinning of the classic paper into a wastebasket game) with the added twist of controlling the spin of the ball after the initial shot is a good idea, and the golf theme fits it well.

B00HB62MC0|5|I've read and loved all of Colleen Hoover's books. And the common denominator, aside from the fact that they were all exceptionally written, was that her books always rendered  me speechless.<br /><br />Colleen writes from the heart, that much was obvious. She draws out all kinds of emotions - you'll be sad, happy, giddy, hopeful,  all the highs & lows.. and always, ALWAYS, feel contented in the end.  You'd feel thankful that there's a writer like her who can give us a reprieve from our everyday routine, like you get lost in this fictional characters yet her stories are so real too. I sometimes wonder if she has multiple personalities, lol.. Coz c'mon, there's no way all these unbelievable characters & stories came out from just one brain!!  Or maybe she's just so damn talented, right? I think I'm girl-crushing on Colleen for so long, haha!<br /><br />Ugly Love. Simply powerful. What I love most about Colleen's stories are the simplicity of her stories. It's something you hear about your friends or you went through it yourself. But the power comes with the delivery.. the feelings the story evoked. And you always, ALWAYS fall in love with the hero!<br /><br />Miles. I wanted to hug him real tight and never let go.<br /><br />Tate. I wanted to be pissed with how &#34;liquid&#34; she was when it comes to Miles, but I understood. Gosh, I can totally relate!<br /><br />You don't need the synopsis, the reviews. You just need to trust that Colleen Hoover will always deliver.. ALWAYS.

B0017I1IZA|3|I have so far enjoyed all of the books in the Stephanie Plum series (I am reading them in order), but Hard Eight was not as tightly constructed as some of the previous books.  The book was enjoyable, but relied too heavily on the established formula for the series, and the ending in particular was disappointing.  The ending almost seemed edited drastically to meet a publisher's deadline or page limit.  I will continue to read the series, though, as I enjoy the lighthearted intrigue, and Stephanie Plum's character just makes me laugh out loud at times.

B0050PYNO4|2|Brief disclaimer about myself...yes, I have my own strongly held Christian based religious beliefs but I believe everybody is entitled to their own views and opinions. I can take a joke, as long as it's good. I am also a huge Simon Pegg fan...I consider \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" to be one of the greatest films ever made and to be a truly inspiring film. Being a big Simon Pegg fan, I ignored the negative reviews for Paul, especially the ones accusing it of \\"religion bashing\\".  I figured it was just some fundementalist Christians, who are even more uptight than me. Unfortunately, that is exactly what the film was, and the worst \\"sin\\" of all is that it is not even remotely funny or clever. A massive collection of talent couldn't save the film from becoming a few actors' diatribes against any and all religious beliefs (not just Christian). The few funny gags have been seen countless times on commercials, the plot was not well developed, nor was the leading villian, leaving it a thinly veiled rant against religion with some Comicon nerd humor thrown in. Being a Simon Pegg/Nick Frost pet project, it basically serves to advocate their atheist views and ridicule anybody with religious beliefs of any kind; imploring people to drink, have sex, and do drugs whenever one can (to each their own). Even though its sole purpose is to insult mine and everybody else's religious views, I could forgive all this as long as it was intellegent and funny...but it's not. It's basically \\"Battlefield Earth\\" for atheists. The humor is lowbrow, which I am usually fine with, as long as it's witty, but it's stuff I would have thought up as a 14 year old. If you're sensitive of your religious views being insulted, this is not for you. If your an atheist looking for an intellegent film to advance your views, this is also not for you. Even if you're just looking for an entertaining film, this again is unfortunately not for you. It was a colossal waste of talent and a major bomb. Sincerely hope Pegg and Frost redeem themselves with their next film because this one sucked.

0380789035|5|I've read many reviews complaining about the pace and the one dimensional characters of American Gods and I'd have to disagree.  I read this book last year and, frankly, it's one of the best books I've read in a long time.  The pace is a little slow, sure, but really think about it, this book gets really involved, and if it didn't go a little slow, after you'd finished the book, you'd be sitting there thinking, \\"Ummm... what?\\"<br />  For, me this wasn't one of those books that you can eat up in a day or two and have the same regard for it. I read it over the span of two and a half weeks; each time I picked it up, I looked forward to a nice, relaxing/ not really that brain relaxing/ more like \\"Wow, that was awesome\\" at times, reading but I digress.  This is the book that first introduced me to Gaiman, and after the read, I was hooked.<br />  To read this book, you have to understand that it's not just a thriller; it's also about the growth of the main character, Shadow.  At the start of the story, he's very one dimensional (on purpose) and through out the story, he grows.  Wednesday, another main character, completely surprised me in the end.  This is not a book to just skim, each and every little side story is important in its own way.  It's called imagery.  Character background.  Each of the side stories gives you a better understanding of the characters or the plot.<br />  I think the most fantastic thing about this book, is how every thing fits together at the end.  It's very rare that one can find a writer who has the skills to straight forwardly start the story, then branch it into twenty different directions, bring it back in, branch it out again, and then tie it all up in a neat little package at the end.  Neil Gaiman is either a total writing genius, or a messed up wacko with issues who enjoys entrancing and fascinating people while at the same time, disturbing and grossing them out.<br />  This is a great book, a classic (in its own demented way), and if a high school sophomore can understand and love this book --along with at least twenty other class mates--, then any one with an open (and maybe a little twisted) mind can also enjoy it.  Seriously. It makes you think (oh no, thinking...)ented way), and if a high school sophomore can understand and love this book --along with at least twenty other class mates--, then any one with an open (and maybe a little twisted) mind can also enjoy it.

1405910259|3|So far I have been disappointed in the titles rushed to publication on the coat tails of Fifty Shades of Grey incredible success and I confess that I expected I would read a few pages of Reflected in You and then set it aside. Instead I was surprised to find myself caught up in the relationship between Eva and Gideon as they try to build a life together. While their mutual attraction is never in doubt, Eva and Gideon are finding that reconciling their emotional needs is much more difficult.<br /><br />There isn't nearly as much sex as I expected in Reflected In You, instead the focus is on the couple's attempts to connect in ways that are not exclusively sexual and establish trust and honesty in their relationship. As both Eva and Gideon have major issues stemming from the abuse they endured as children neither trusts easily and true intimacy is something they need to work at developing. Unfortunately their pasts seem intent on sabotaging their attempts with Gideon's scheming ex lover causing trouble and Eva's abuser making a shocking reappearance.<br />While the relationship between Eva and Gideon is not exactly healthy, clouded as it is by lust and obsession, it's a surprisingly equal partnership. I had expected more of a master/slave scenario both sexually and in their everyday interactions but that was not the case.<br /><br />Perhaps what I found most surprising about Reflected In You was the quality of writing, Day's experience as an accomplished author is evident. There is a lot of angst, contrived misunderstandings and melodrama but there is also a genuine portrayal of passion, affection and intimacy.<br /><br />I haven't read Bared to You, the first installment in the Crossfire trilogy, so I came into this storyline without any knowledge of the characters but I found this didn't really matter. Reflected in You is a surprisingly engaging read and I think that readers who have been reluctant to embrace the mainstream erotica trend should sample the Crosssfire series before dismissing the entire genre.series before dismissing the entire genre.
B003RRY60S|3|I've been really disappointed in the books written about Doctor Who that I have read so far. They don't seem to have the pizzazz as the TV show has and the storylines seem to be geared more towards young teens rather than adults. Maybe I'm asking too much since I really love the tv series, but I'm still holding out for that one great Doctor Who book that I have yet to read. Anyway, it was an ok story and David Tennant looks good in my imagination no matter what the scenario! :)
B000QRIGLC|5|An amazing true story told by an American hero. I could not stop reading until it was finished. My body hurt after reading this book.

B000W00Y0Y|5|I bought this for my Brother for Christmas & he was thrilled with it. I was happy that he was happy. There is some great footage on here from Live Aid which is really classic. I am pleased with both product and Seller.
B008JFUS0U|4|I rated this a 4 because when we went to use it the movie kept freezing. When we took out the dvd was wet with something as we are not sure with what. We has to get a soft cloth to wipe down. Once that was done it was all set. Movie was awesome.

0071752854|5|Pitch Anything describes the dynamics of human interaction whereby Oren Klaff proves that some rules are necessary for delivering effective presentations, for persuading others or for any other type of social communication. He outlines those rules to readers in this well written, evidence based and entertaining book. Specifically, the dynamics and language of successful deal making interactions are professionally presented, the terms are identified, defined and related through engaging stories from Oren's personal experience. Consider this a prize book that you could ignore, or use to gain counterintuitive wisdom and high esteem for communicating your own message.
B0070Y46UY|3|Book was alright. Expected more based on all the hype the book received. Beginning was very slow and hard to get into, but excitement built after ship sailed. All in all, it was decent, but nothing spectacular.

B004MC8CA2|5|This is a great application. Works great on my Honeycomb tablet.  Reading plans are good and every translation you could want are available.   The only improvement I would suggest is the availability to make notes off-line and have it sync with your on-line account later.
B0045Y1NL2|1|This is a review of The Actually Complete Works of William Shakespeare in the Kindle edition. The Amazon reviews for Shakespeare seem to be completely mixed up.<br />This book has no useful table of contents so it's only value is to someone who wants to read the poems and plays end to end.<br />I would like to find each play listed separately- is that too much to ask?
B00009L1TA|5|\\"Basic\\" is one kick-butt military who-dun-it movie.  Travolta is perfect for the role.  Connie Nielsen offers a great balance.  All the other players are generally well-cast.  The story morphs continuously as interrogations proceed throughout the film.  The end?  I can't believe ANYONE complained about the end.  It is a fun exclamation point to a well-schemed plan to reveal the bad guy.  It is impossible to watch \\"Basic\\" one time and catch all that is happening or the significance of the twists and turns.  If you love action flicks, military, and crime mystery rolled into one well-conceived plot you gotta watch \\"Basic.\\"  If I've watched \\"Basic\\" once I've watched it at least a couple dozen times and I STILL see or hear something new that shows the attention to detail in the script.  One fun movie that engages the brain.    BTW, the DVD transfer and Dolby 5.1 soundtrack are exceptional.  Blu-ray (if ever available) would add little to the quality of the images.
0066620996|5|Though the analysis was at a strategic macro level, the application is for practically any level of leadership.

B009ZQC7MY|5|Best show on tv. Very interged by turn of the century way
B007EC6FIS|5|I couldn't be more stunned by the three reviews before mine. \\"Strangeland\\" is an exceptionally strong return to solid ground for Keane, whose first two albums set the bar. I do agree that the third album, \\"Perfect Symmetry,\\" as well as the fourth, \\"Night Train,\\" were disappointments with only a few standout tracks each. That's partly why I love \\"Strangeland\\" so much -- it's a return to the sublime Keane sound of old, yet burnished with maturity and confidence.  Even if this were the first Keane album I'd ever heard, I'd be feeling just as good about it. High points, in my opinion, are \\"You Are Young,\\" \\"In Your Own Time\\" and \\"Strangeland,\\" but it's hard for me to single those out when nearly all 16 tracks are so good. There is NOTHING I want to skip here, and that's rare for me. \\"On the Road\\" and \\"Day Will Come\\" round out the top 5. As I listen to the album more, I suspect that \\"Black Rain,\\" \\"The Starting Line\\" and others will grow on me. The astonishly good b-side, \\"Myth,\\" is not included on the album, but I was able to get that elsewhere and thus complete the package.  Weakest tracks -- and these are still fine, just not memorable -- are \\"Neon River,\\" \\"Boys,\\" and \\"Sea Fog\\" -- I don't know why some listeners like \\"Sea Fog\\" so much, it's got a pretty sound but it's so boring compared to the rest of the tracks. If there's one complaint I'd make, it's that the songs are short; almost all of them are under 4 minutes. That's a shame, because with tunes this good, you really want to get into them and make them last. Fortunately, Keane gives us 16 songs here, so the album's total length is a very fine one hour. Bottom line: I'm really impressed by \\"Strangeland\\" and it will be stuck in my player for quite a while going forward.

038572179X|3|this book was only so-so. i wanted to read it before seeing the movie, but i dont plan on watching the film now that i've read the novel it was based on.<br /><br />i like the first part when the author uses characters' different viewpoints to set up the central conflict of the story... but then in the entire middle section it was mostly briony's story and there were only a few ties to the original problem and as for all the war stuff, it was nothing special. i've read other books with war scenes described more impressively.  and i was not very surprised/astonished by the \\"twist\\" at the end. i ended up not really caring about what'd actually happened to the characters.
B004SBQALA|5|One of my favorite movies which was actually taken from a book!!

B00RVC3YKI|1|Almost three hours of my life I will never get back.  I have never felt the need to review anything before, but this is another story.  Of all the time wasting, dull, painful movies I have had the pleasure of watching, this one beats them all.  Lesson learned: never trust a critic.  If you want to spend almost three hours watching an aimless, plodding and tedious story of a boy growing up, this is the movie for you.  If you find yourself halfway through the movie asking yourself &#34;is something about to happen?&#34; the answer is no.
B003QTUQGU|2|It's been a long time since I watched the original Alice in Wonderland and I was never all too partial to it so I went into this not biased against a remake. I didn't see this in the theaters and didn't see this in 3D (just did the Instant Video just now) and I found it rather boring.<br /><br />I didn't particularly care what was happening to Alice. It was visually stunning but it wasn't enough to keep my interest. In fact, I kept wondering about the real world and how Alice was going to answer Hamish and deal with her cheating brother-in-law more than I cared about her killing the Jabberwocky. I mean, it's obvious she would become the real Alice at the end, and take up the mantle of the Champion so of course she was going to kill the damned monster. There was no urgency to the story since it was so predictable. And that made it quite boring in my mind.<br /><br />But maybe the 3D effects would have made up for the lackluster plot, like it did with Avatar. But since I didn't see it with them, I came out of this movie supremely underwhelmed. And I wish I had spent my money (not to mention my time!) on something else.
B007IXWL2C|4|Perfect Ending!! Loved it! Also love the extra pages at the end that are written in Christian's point of view. Made me def. read the beginning of the first book again!
0920668372|5|I have a many siblings and we watched our mother get sicker and sicker every day for many years. In the beginning of her sickness she would read this book to us every night before we would go about our daily chores and dinner routine. We would all crowd into her bedroom and settle on her bed and floor and listen to her read it. We even recorded her reading it. When she became so sick that she couldn't speak anymore, we still gathered in her room and played the tape of her reading all holding our own copies of this book. If our mother could have come into our rooms and rocked us to sleep or protected us from our nightmares it was when we heard her read this book. Even in sickness and death she will continue to read this book to us and I know that even when I am fighting in another country that she is holding me. I brought a copy of this book and her reading to the Middle East with me. Now I have it here and my children listen to my mother read it every night before bed, just like I know my siblings children do as well. I cry every time I hear the tape, and I hope many more families make wonderful memories with this wonderful book of love that goes everywhere.
B00K0OI42W|5|Excellent book, if you would like to understand the caste system of the south and how deeply racism is rooted in the south this book will give you an understanding of that culture. It's much more detailed than the movie, I would highly recommend this book.

B007URVZJ6|4|Got a lot of great tips out of this book, and plan on putting them to good use.  It's a great starting point if you're even thinking about publishing via Kindle, so I highly recommend that you read this before you start so you can format first, then continue writing.

B003UBTX72|5|Astonishingly eloquent and street-wise lyrical, this is the vivid memoir of a middle-class Dartford boy who grew up in the challenge of post-war England and managed to spin his love of the blues and the guitar into a golden career with one of the greatest rock bands. He writes as if the reader was his confident. At once brilliant, witty, wistful, and unapologetic. A glimpse into the behind-the-scenes life world of a vintage rock star, complete with glamour and dross, as well as the blood, sweat, and tears it took to rise to the top and stay there. There are no end to the magnificent tales of peaks and valleys, and Richards has an engaging way of sharing what he knows about keeping ahead of the pack to keep his chops sharp and the band on key. The soul of a band that continues to give as good as it gets.

B0002W0ZVK|5|This is a soundtrack to the documentary \\"Elvis That's the Way It Is.\\" The album was a modest hit when it was released in 1970 peaking at 21 on the US album chart (number 8 on the US Country chart) and 12 in the UK.  It would be certified GOLD by the RIAA.  The documentary covered Elvis' concerts in Las Vegas. It includes both live recordings from the show and \\"studio rehearsal\\" recordings.  It includes the US hit single \\"You Don't Have to Say You Love Me\\" and the UK hit single \\"I Just Can't Help Believin'\\".  While it is a little lite on the number of songs included (it is just a reissue of the LP) it is still an excellent collection and a must for Elvis fans.  Elvis is in top form for these recordings.

B00B78AIV0|5|I'm a fan of Ms. Adichie's and when compared to Americanah and Half a Yellow Sun, this is her best. The story development is smooth from the first introduction of Kambili's family. The author gives enough of a hint that something is wrong that you want to read on. Gradually, she pulls you along to the end, which is surprising, yet you feel that you should have expected it would end that way. The girl's voice is the right combination of fear, desire for love (from her father and a young priest), and steady, clear observation for the narrative. You can see, smell, and hear Nigeria in the descriptions of life there. This is a rich family, even by American standards, that is Dysfunctional with a capital D. The father is religious, in a way that is influenced too much by Catholic Europeans (the author seems to say). Underneath his faithful church going and praying is a need to control his wife and children through violence. His daughter comes second in her class and he abuses her for not being first. He beats his wife and she miscarries multiple times. He shuns his own father for being a pagan. Then there's Kambili's aunt, her father's sister and a widow, whose family is warm and loving and provide a refuge for Kambili and her brother, JaJa. It's a great read, comparable to Things Fall Apart, We Need New Names, and The Poisonwood Bible. Religion run amok, family violence, cultural clashes. You won't be able to put it down.

0385333846|4|With &quot;Slaughterhouse Five,&quot; Kurt Vonnegut has done the near impossible - he has created a surrealistically cautionary novel that uses humor to get at the horror of war and destruction.  While the  aforementioned intent is almost oxymoronic, somehow Vonnegut manages to  strike this very balance between humor and horror.  The chief reason this  novel succeeds is because it downplays dramatic confrontations and  characterizations and focuses instead on a detached, external perspective  in an effort to contrast the futility of mankind with his circumstances.   Truly a funny book that you won't dare laugh at.

To be such a short movie, you actually have to flip the dvd over half way through to finish watching it.  That's right.  Flip it over to finish watching it.  Like I said, I'm very pleased with the speed of the delivery, and will order from them again.  Perhaps next time I will splurge for the $10 dvd and get better quality.

B00008H2LB|4|A four star review coming from a straight rap fan (well, not today's rap). I thought that Linkin' Park did very well, for an album on their own (I got started on this when they teamed up with Jay-Z for Collision Course). Songs like Don't Stay & Faint, are straight rockers to me, and Somewhere I Belong & Numb tell a good story. Lying From You sounds great too. Breaking the Habit is a wonderful song, and if it actually took them so long to produce, it was worth the wait. I'd of course like Nobody's Listening, because I am a hip-hop fan (That Japanese Flute is wonderful). Session shows me that even their DJ has skills. My favorite is Numb, because the concept I can apply to a lot of things. It's a shame that 2 years ago when this came out, I didn't get it, only because of what I thought they were. Well, it is totall different. It's a nice CD, and well worth the money.

0671042858|2|The Mundane Adventures of a Baseball Fan<br /><br />Don’t let the title fool you, this novel isn’t for the inner romantic. The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon was written by the great horror novelist Stephen King and published in 1999. This short read encompasses the story of a young girl, an adamant Red Sox fan,  lost in the Appalachian Mountains and struggling for her life. While one would suspect the woods to be filled with horrific creatures and ghastly ghouls, the only horror in the book seems to be in the young girls head. Not only does Patricia fight for her survival, but for her sanity as well.  Narrowly classified as a ‘psychological thriller’ this novel barely earns its place in the genre due to its crawling story-line,  inessential length, and its disappointingly predictable  plot.<br /><br />The novel essentially takes place in the wilderness of Maine in the late 90’s. Patricia McFarland, the product of a freshly divorced move to a new city,  strays away from her mother and older brother during a hiking trip in the Appalachian Mountains. From the point Patricia realizes she is lost, she is constantly moving, trying to find her way back  to civilization. Her failure to make a permanent residence becomes her ultimate downfall as she finds herself deeper and deeper inside the woods with an overactive imagination and an empty stomach, loosely clinging to her sanity. Hallucinations begin to take over the better part of  Patricias judgement and soon she believes herself to be walking alongside the famous Red Sox closer, Tom Gordon. Tom isn’t the only one that accompanies her throughout her journey. She soon begins to convince herself that some dark, demonic being is keeping tabs on her every move, just waiting to sink its claws into her malnourished body.<br /><br />Although King is an extremely talented writer, this novel is just not up to par with his other novels I have enjoyed. Simply put, the storyline is uneventful and predictable. Anyone picking up a novel with Stephen King's name on it is likely to expect a edge-of-your-seat thriller or a twisted, nightmarish horror, but such is not the case with this novel. While the book is only around two-hundred pages, it could easily be told in under a hundred.  The irrelevant details seem to be compensating for the lack of venture and only add to the unnecessary extensiveness of the novel making it mundane and synonymous. Along with being lengthy and dry, the story-line barely fits into the genre of ‘psychological thriller’ as it has been categorized, giving one a misleading expectation of what the novel entails.<br />Ultimately, I would never recommend this book to avid horror lovers, although I am a tremendous fan of Stephen King and his previous works I have read. The novel is unappealing to a fan of hair-raising twists and blood soaked mystery . It was extremely disappointing to encounter a book of Kings that I did not  love.  I wasn’t delighted with Patricia as a main character and found her personality rather shallow and uninteresting, and because the book focuses on her throughout the plot I found it burdensome to read the entire story cover to cover. In its entirety, I found this novel as a waste of time and energy.  I only hope that this was a one time mistake in the length of Kings career.p a novel with Stephen King's name on it is likely to expect a edge-of-your-seat thriller or a twisted, nightmarish horror, but such is not the case with this novel.

It's obviously one of my favorite records.  If you listen to most of the other reviewers here I guess that makes me either psychotic (at worst) or a hopeless geek (at best).  But I don't necessarily love it for the \\"music\\".  I find that I'm fascinated by Lou's complete and utter rejection of commercial success and conformity.  Only Van Morrison worked harder to push success away (but, of course, made arguably better art doing it). <br />It is my understanding, from reading just about every Lou Reed/Velvet Underground biography ever printed, that MMM was not entirely a joke nor entirely a \\"middle finger\\" to the fans or RCA.  Lou had to make one more record to fulfill his contract and RCA was pushing him for it.  So he sat down and made this recording of squealing feedback.  RCA was skeptical but Lou had a reputation (rightly or wrongly) for being edgy so he was able to convince them of it's merit so thoroughly that they wanted to release it on their classical music label.  In a interview by Lester Bangs Lou claimed he talked them out of that because (here's the real joke...) he thought that would be pretentious! <br />Lester Bangs also wrote a sometimes irony-free article suggesting that MMM was the best album ever made.  That article is the reason I searched out and stole that CD copy all those years ago.  Now, I can't say, as Lester did that, \\"I take [MMM] about once a day, like vitamins\\"  but I will say that if you actually listen to MMM it is pretty interesting, especially through headphones.  The screeching noise through the two stereo channels is almost hypnotic and if you listen long enough you'll swear there are voices in there.  All that said though, is there any reason a regular ol' Sweet Jane loving Lou fan should own this?  Well, I guess not.  Exceptmaybe as an historical artifact or it is useful as a late-night-party-ender.  There are those of us though who, for whatever reason, have risen above being just a Regular ol' Lou fan and have morphed into something more... more... Cynical, I guess.  I mean I would rather listen to MMM a hundred times than be forced to hear The Raven even once.  Geez, which album is the joke here, huh? <br />Bottom line is, if you're only a Lou Reed dabbler or if you have Lou albums AND Coldplay albums don't bother with MMM.  Me, though?  I plan on playing it at my wedding, during my first dance with the new mother-in-law. <br />By the way, Metal Machine Music was recently resurrected and transcribed by Zeitkratzer, a ten-piece German orchestra ensemble, for a live performance at the Berlin Opera House, and Reed was invited for a guitar solo.  So, there are other masochistic goons out there too.

B00009TB5G|2|With all that could have been great about The Two Towers, it's funny that one of the book's \\"villains\\" saves the film. The scenes involving Gollum (interacting with Frodo and Sam) are the only ones that really shine and remain true to Tolkien's characterization. I would buy the DVD just for these scenes.<BR>The other plot points are so dumbed-down as to be Harry Potter-esque. Faramir turns out to be little better than his brother, Theoden's fall from greatness is changed from being a product of subtle mind-control and human despair to a simple wizard's spell, Gimli is transformed from a Dwarf to be reckoned with to an utter buffoon, and Aragorn seems to go through the motions of a lead character (complete with \\"suspenseful\\" dive off a cliff). I'm not saying the film should be an exact copy of the books. There's no practical way to do that. But certain basics of character and plot could be faithfully preserved without hopelessly confusing the average movie-goer (and i won't even get started with the HORROR of what Jackson did with Arwen). I can only hope The Return of the King is better. Please!!

B009KHDT0C|5|Loved this movie- I was prepared to be disappointed as I am a major fan of the original Dark Shadows- A totally different, fun and very creative take from the original- Tim Burton does not disappoint! The sets, makeup, special effects, cast, direction is incredible! My only two dissapointments: Alice Cooper was cut in the middle of his performance- At the very least, he should been allowed to finish and given more time- And, more time given to the original cast- Afterall, they were the ones responsible for the Success of Dark Shadows- if you blinked you probably missed the fabulous Jonathan Frid, the original Barnabas- All in all, it is a fun movie for everyone- Perhaps there will be a sequel!

B003J27WFW|5|Very informative, tons of vintage footage! A must see for Rush fans or fans of hard rock in general-if you're not already a fan, watch this documentary and prepare to be converted!
B000641D2Y|5|Because this is such a great kid movie. It was nice to watch it with them and laughed with them because it was so funny
B0000634EV|5|I am someone who listens to a variety of music.Admittedly ,before I heard this album,I was already a fan of Pantera, COC, Eye Hate God, and Down's first album - Nola.  I was still pleasantly surprised when I listened to it.  It is still heavy enough to keep the Pantera Fans interested, but also can get people who are fans of bands like Nazareth, Led Zeppelin, and Stevie Ray Vaughn to get hooked on this album.  It is very heavily blues oriented, but has a melodic side to it, also.  I think this is the best album to come out in a long time - thanks guys!
B000KB8DB2|5|Amazing documentary
B00005JPNZ|5|1957 - jeeps are driving up to a military base.  There's a sign warning of a bomb test shortly.  A Colonel requests entrance on the base and is denied.  His men open fire on the sentries and storm the base.      Their goal--the soon to be detonated bomb? Nope, the dusty storage facility.    The men, who turn out to be Russians, open the trunk and drag out a hostage.  Guess who?  If you guessed Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) you are correct.     That's the opening to this film...    It's twenty years after we left Indy.  He's a little bit greyer, but he's still going strong.  This time, he's teamed up with Mutt Williams (Shia LaBeouf), a motorcycle riding, leather wearing college dropout who needs his help saving his father Oxley (John Hurt) and Mom, Mary (Karen Allen) from the Russians who are holding them captive.     What the Russians want is a Nascan Indian relic, a crystal skull of legend that some say was the manifestation of a god. If they don't get it, Mutt's parents die.      There's a lot to like about this film:    There may be some wear and tear on Ford, but he can still pull off playing Indy.     Karen Allen is back reprising her role as Marion Ravenwood. She's always been the best of the female leads in this series and she still can deliver 26 years after \\"Raiders.\\"     Dr. Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett) a Russian research into psychic phenomenon and the supernatural is the lead villain and she plays her part superbly. My favorite part of this film is the typical car chase with an Indy twist that every action and adventure fan should love.     Plus, I think the themes in this story tie together a lot of elements that people who love the Indy series are going to appreciate.  I will definitely be buying the DVD when it becomes available.

0143039431|4|I was part of a family that left Oklahoma in 1938.  I did not know anything about the difficulties encountered by poor folks trying to find a better life in the west.  Steinbeck was a deep thinker and expert writer.  I got awfully tired of the filthy language and had to quit reading it to my wife because of that.  I cannot disregard the fact that the language in the book was any different than the language of the people described.<br />  As i look back and remember that my father driving a 1928 Pontiac and pulling a homemade trailer landed at his brother's rented house in Tacoma with five dollars in his pocket.  The automobile was a gift from his elderly aunt.  We lived together with my uncle and his family in a one bedroom house for two months.  There were ten of us.<br />  I am glad that we went to WA and not to CA.  We were not mistreated in anyway.  The book brings back a lifetime of memories totally different than the history recorded by a great author like Steinbeck.<br />  I now live in a community with streets named for authors.  I live on Steinbeck Dr.  Ben Around

006202406X|1|I will not critique the ending, though do not get me started on that. The true flaw of this book is the terrible decision to have dual voices. Was Roth trying to shock us? Was she out of ideas? Horrible decision. Roth cannot make any distinction between narrators and I frequently had to remind myself whose perspective I was reading. Moreover, the plot never truly comes together with any logic. Like Suzanne Collins before her, Roth falls victim to a terrible last book in a trilogy. I suspect she tried to write it and get it off to the publisher too quickly and with too much of a wish to \\"have a bang.\\" Lesson learned: authors, please don't write a third book for the sake of writing a third book. Wait until your plot makes sense. Better yet? Make sure you have a quality ending before you write book one and two. Also, probably best to keep all books in a trilogy written in the same voice.

B009XIXVU6|4|A lovely story of different lives bond together.
038551123X|5|In Jeff Lindsay's &quot;Darkly Dreaming Dexter,&quot; the antihero is Dexter Morgan, a lovable serial killer. Dexter suffered through a traumatic childhood event, and it left him with an insatiable desire to kill people. Instead of visiting a psychiatrist or joining a support group, Dexter pursues his hobby and finds interesting ways to satisfy his blood lust. Ironically, Dexter's day job is blood-spatter analyst for the Miami Police Department.<br /><br /> It's hard not to like Dexter. He's good-looking, unfailingly polite, and attentive to his sister, Deb, a cop. Since Dexter has terrific insight into the minds of serial killers, he helps his sister by feeding her his opinions on an investigation into a series of brutal killings and dismemberments of female prostitutes in Miami. Deb hopes that this information will help her crack the case and get a promotion to the Homicide Bureau. As this other serial killer continues on his murderous rampage, it becomes increasingly clear that Dexter's understanding of the case and his empathy with the killer is too thorough. He begins to suspect that there is a strong and frightening connection between him and the murderer.<br /><br /> Dexter is a fascinating and original character, a serial killer with a self-deprecating sense of humor and no illusions about himself. He knows that he is not like everyone else, and he tries to make the best of it. In several hilarious scenes, women hit on Dexter, and he is so devoid of real emotion and human understanding, that he has no idea how to respond.<br /><br /> Lindsay covers some old territory, too, in which he explores departmental politics and bureaucratic ineptitude in the police department. The dialogue is clever and witty and the story is fast-paced, albeit completely unrealistic, but the book succeeds mostly because Dexter is so entertaining. Is it tasteful to feature a hero who kills regularly because his inner demons compel him to do so? Probably not, but &quot;Darkly Dreaming Dexter&quot; is funny, deliciously creepy, and a real page-turner.ny, deliciously creepy, and a real page-turner.
B009ZQ8FQG|5|I love the different options provided in the billing process - this was a gift and it was so easy to hide the price, leave a note, etc. The feature that tells you when it will arrive by is also very nice and honest, and everything I order from Amazon arrives so fast. Thank you for all you do!!!
B00B2G2RG6|2|Just another network flop. I thought it would be another Hannibal-type chiller but it just seemed to lose itself in Edgar Allen Poe instead. Became slow, somewhat overstaged as do many network TV series. Couldn't get past 4 or 5 episodes. Sorry.
B00B0LPYXG|3|Allows main character to get introspective and by doing this shows man in mirror concept and a person's ability to start road to recovery.
B003Q6D282|5|I enjoyed the series even though I wish they would have extended it out one more movie instead of rushing 2 movies into 1 with Saw The Final Chapter.
B0081L37Z0|4|Some of the lines were, I'll say, less than awe-inspiring...but if you're just looking for an hour and a half of mindless entertainment, it's a good flick.  The bits where the original 21 Jumpstreet actors reprise their roles are actually pretty funny!

B00KCUY7CU|5|Album of the year for me.  As a bubble-gum-pop addict and a student of well written lyrics, this scratches all the itches.  Everything I love about music--from contemporary pop--Britney, and Miley--to 80s acts like Blondie and Mary Margaret Ohara, to Modest Mouse or Radiohead, this album somehow reminds me, at one part or another, of everything I love of all my favorite bands/performers.  With intricately mixed and perfectly balanced tracks with mystifying, seductive lyrics, this album begs for the repeat setting.  You'd be depriving yourself not to give it a listen--or twenty.
006202406X|5|Loved this book as much as the other two books in the series!  Just like the other two books it draws you in right from the beginning and doesn't let go!
B00AHGSVKS|3|I read this book with the hope  it would match the same thrill of Clarke's 2001 series but it did not deliver . The twist is somewhat anti-climactic. Clarke still dazzles with picture perfect delivery and engages the reader with foreshadowing that can be sometimes a little too straight forward. It's a solid read however and at 200 pages and change its worth your time if you're in the mood for a short sci-fi novel.
B000VI70WM|5|This is such a fantastic record!  All the great elements we've come to love about Duran Duran are there once again and yet, everything sounds fresh and alive.  Beautiful melodys, rich synth-scapes, crisp rhythm, driving bass grooves, and perfect vocal harmonies are all there once again in a collection of new songs that are very easy on the ears.  My personal favorite tracks are:    1. The Valley- This opener is probably not what you would expect but it is great fun to listen to as it develops from a simple synth-riff into a complicated and catchy production.  I love the very \\"present sounding\\" bass solo...its very different from what we've heard before.  Background vocals are amazing.  2. Falling Down- Simply beautiful...right up there with \\"Save a Prayer\\" as one of their finest ballads.  3. Box Full O'Honey- A nice acoustic oriented number where Simon impresses once again with his remarkable melodic gift.  4.Zoom In - I saw someone bagging on this tune earlier which mystifies me.  To those that don't enjoy it...try listening this way.  Listen to the chorus each time it comes by. It goes from a single line, to a unison line, to a harmonized line, to a more dramatically harmonized line and so on.  The dissonance in the chorus near the end of the tune is remarkable.    One reviewer noted that \\"Tricked Out\\" had kind of a \\"Munsters\\" sound to it. I have to agree...I thought it sounded kind of like \\"Scooby Doo\\" so there must be something to it.  Even still, I enjoy the track.    Well done guys!  Now get back to the studio and make us another one!

B003D81NVQ|5|Its not for the squeamish. There is violence, Tarantino-like violence. An array of interesting, well-defined, flawed, fascinating characters. Many surprises. Its the antithesis of your standard, pablum, moronic, bland, light, banal tv series.<br />Try it and you may quickly decide its not for you, or, you will become addicted and watch 2 or 3 episodes in an evening.<br />Superb characters, superb acting, and though the situations are far removed from ordinary life, they do reflect the life responses present in all of us.

B00008976Y|3|Julie Vignon - de Courcy a young Frenchwoman (Juliette Binoche) is involved in an accident that will set her on a journey self-discovery. We go along with her and imaging what we would have done.<br /><br />This is a good film with a message. It is blurred by the attempt to introduce too many details that are trying to reflect ideas that could have been left out or explained strait forward.  The lack of direct information and many of the modifications from the screenplay makes this an average rated film.<br /><br />I believe that this film requires a common knowlege the writer and a film genera that I am not familiar with so the target audience may be restricted.<br /><br />One plus is the Cinematography of Slawomir Idziak that will really come to life in the film  GATTACA (1997).<br /><br />The film finally comes alive and what on the surface seems a musical downer of a depressed person in a depressed world can come alive for us if we listen to the voice over interpretation first. The version I have is the Criterion version so I am not sure that other versions have the voice over with Annette Insore.

0743270754|5|An extremely well written and documented story of Lincoln's turbulent final years in office. Filled with quotations, it reads like a novel, despite containing historical fact. There are a number of parallels to government today, and Lincoln comes across as a real person, not a historical icon. How he dealt with the pressures of the civil war while dealing with an unsupportive and unhappy wife is truly amazing. Well worth reading, I highly recommend this book.
0451197879|3|Reason for Reading:  I'm re/reading Stephen King's works in chronological order and this was next in line.<br /><br />This is my first re-read that I went into it with absolutely no memory of the story whatsoever.  And my copy only has some vague sentence about an angry man fighting back as a summary so I was none the wiser from that.  As I read it really didn't come back to me either, which is strange as I completely remember the other three in my omnibus edition.<br /><br />This is a hard book for me to review as it got better as I read it.  Honestly, I was quite bored for the first half and didn't really get hooked until close to the end when the excitement built.  This is a story that tries too hard to show the reader the mental breakdown of a man.  One who looses it and goes out \\"guns blazing\\".  When we meet Bart he's already well down the road to no return, hearing a voice and talking with it.  The book takes a long time to slowly let the reader know who this voice is and what the whole story behind it is and this is part of the book's slowness and what made it such a bland read for the most part.  Now, even though I seem negative here; the book wasn't bad; in fact it was good.  This story is a thinker.  Bart is 'crazy' when we meet him and in my mind the deeper he goes into his insanity the saner he becomes, until at the end of the book when he can be viewed as a madman, he is at his ultimate sanest moment in the entire book.  He has taken himself where he wanted to end up even though he didn't know it as far back as a few years ago when \\"the incident\\" happened and he's enjoyed these last weeks getting there.  I was satisfied with the read at the end, even though I had a hard time really getting into it.<br /><br />This is the first Bachman that I truly felt was King.  The writing style, the stream of consciousness, the dialogue are all classic King and thinking back I can see true fans of the time putting the clues together at this point and outing King as Bachman (or at least suspecting) with this book.<br /><br />When I read a King, I always look out for connections to other books and the only one I noticed here was one of the laundry machines was called The Mangler.  This is the name of a machine (perhaps even the title?) in a short story in \\"Night Shift\\".achman (or at least suspecting) with this book.<br /><br />When I read a King, I always look out for connections to other books and the only one I noticed here was one of the laundry machines was called The Mangler.

B000TEUSJU|5|It's nearly 30 years since Caligula was released onto an expectant, or is it more correct to say an unexpectant, global cinema audience. And they were not to be disappointed. Stage and cinema royalty including Sir Peter O'Toole, Sir John Gielgud and Dame Helen Mirren (only Gielgud was knighted at the time) joined Malcolm McDowell and a collection of Italian and European actors in an orgy of violence and sex which included graphic XXX pornography taken directly from the pages of Seutonius' chapter on Caligula in the second century book The Twelve Caesars.<br /><br />This marvellous 3 disc DVD set contains fascinating documentaries featuring extensive interviews with producer Bob Guccione and writer Gore Vidal shot at the time of production.  The full uncut 156 minute version features on the first disc. The second disc has a  shorter version which has wonderful commentary tracks by Mirren and McDowell. Alas, the 200 plus minute Guccione edited version, which was rumoured to have been shown to preview audiences in Italy, is not included in this set and in fact may no longer exist.<br /><br />It is now well known that the film that Vidal wrote and Director Tinto Brass shot are not what was finally released after Guccione took control of the editing and shut Brass out of the production. To bridge huge continuity gaps Guccione and his editors extensively used out-takes and rehearsal footage rescued from rubbish bins. The documentary material provides fascinating information about what might have been a masterpiece had Brass been allowed to edit the film he shot and do pick up shots, retakes and the shooting of much needed new scenes which would become self evident in the editing stage.<br /><br />Thanks to the documentary material, we get to fully appreciate the incredible production design, the magnitude and details of the various sets and the beautiful costumes made by Production Designer Danilo Donati and his team. This is not always evident in the finished film.<br /><br />There is a wonderful interview with the very erudite John Steiner, a British actor who built a short but spectacular career in Italian exploitation films in the 1970s. Steiner shaved his head to play the slimey Longinus character. Now a real estate agent in England, Steiner's witty comments about the making of the film are worth the price of the DVD set alone.<br /><br />As time goes by Caligula will continue to be restudied and reassessed. No doubt it will gain in stature but unlike the other Caligula film of cinema legend, the `lost' 1937 I Claudius featuring Charles Laughton as Claudius and Emlyn Williams as Caligula, we have ample material to study and assess thanks to this excellent DVD collection.

B000002I2G|5|Every Doors album was an experiment, not just this one. (It just depends on your perceptions and whether your mind is open to differnt ideas). They're all different albums. They're all good too. Don't listen to anyone who says The Soft Parade is bad. Listen to it for yourself. You might be pleasantly surprised, like I was. Actually, this and Morrison Hotel are my favorite Doors albums. (They don't contain all the greatest songs, but being concept albums, they are my favorites.)<br />The concept of Soft Parade being loss of freedom, the burden of fame, and therefore searching for meaning, or &quot;something new&quot;. Jim seems really bummed on this album, but in an optimistic way, like he's looking ahead to the future....<br />It's a great album. Even if it doesn't have all the biggest &quot;hits&quot;, at least it's more cohesive than Waiting For The Sun or LA Woman.
B009UX2YAC|5|This game is great for all ages. I love it. It is good for late nights when you get board. Get this game now, not later and watch for the monthly updates
B0049J3RBC|5|I am influenced by two things.  First, I had a great dad with daughter movie night that I cherished.  Secondly, it supports my view that you can't judge a book by its cover.  As a Christian believer, this is more important than ever to embrace those who are deemed unacceptable.  Since God can redeem any situation for his glory, we should start with loving people for who they are and not condemn someone because they are different.  The movie itself was a great story about believing in yourself and the good in the world versus the over generalized view of the world.  Add the love for cooking and the creative experience it creates in all of us and you have a winner of a movie.  Well done Disney and Pixar.
B00CO8D3G4|2|It contains some nice ideas to ponder, but is poorly written and chaotic. Read only if you have nothing else to do, otherwise grab something else; there are plenty of much better options out there.
B00APJLFEG|5|This movie is super cute and i am thinking about buying it.Also buy it in HD if you have HD because i rented it without it and it was not as good as i know it could be.
B00004W5UA|5|when I got home after fight club, I couldn't sleep, so I got up again and  went to a bar to have a beer and then it hit me: I had just seen the most  history-advanced movie since clockwork orange.    I had just seen the truth  about life in our society and its absurd rules, I had seen soap as the  hammer of the gods.  Go see it and learn about yourself and your miserable  little lives
0385353308|5|I've loved post-apocalyptic stories since I read The Stand in 1982. I've read several since The Stand and Outpost 11 stands out with the best of them. Not only is it about how the characters survive, it's also about how their lives are tangled together even after the fall of civilization. One of the characters, pre-apocalypse, is in the process of writing a series of Sci Fi graphic novels about a place called Station 11. The graphic novels are almost like a character of the story themselves. One thing I really like is the way the author parallels the worlds of the graphic novel and the post apocalyptic earth. The people in the graphic novel who live on Station 11 long to go home, and will never be able to.........just like the survivors of the Georgia Flu. It's a novel of loss, love, and in the end, looking forward with optimism. It's a very good read.
B004GXHOGK|5|Very sweet fox, I painted a white tip to his tail.
B00DURGZHW|5|I think this is just another movie to chalk up for the director and Matthew McConaughey. Matthew put on a great performance that is part of an increasingly good number of acting choices by the man. I highly recommend this movie.
B006MPKDUE|3|A good read but not as hypnotic as other Harry Bosch books but very enjoyable
B00881VLCE|1|I was never able to get into the puzzle that I chose, so I have not tried to solve the puzzle.
B000001E3V|5|Why is Eric Clapton at the top of the list of great guitar players?  This set showcases the answer in a sweeping tour de force at the old Fillmore East.  In those days Second Avenue below Union Square was an adventure but the Fillmore made the trip worthwhile.  Playing two shows a night, Clapton simply soars after his liberation from Cream.  He is just getting comfortable with the idea of being the lead singer and it shows, but the guitar work is magical.  Even Clapton admits that some of what he did in these shows is beyond his current abilities, but the chance to hear what early Clapton at the absolute top of his game sounded like is priceless.
B00005R24G|5|Most of the reviews here refer to the OLD DVD edition (notice they are all from 2000 or before). The edition offered here is NEW, and a vast improvement. Don't let the old reviews prevent you from buying this new DVD.
B00MILGZZS|5|Funny as always!
B00BD99JMW|5|There's always a way you expect things to go... And then there's this book. Roth amazed with every turn of the page.
B009UX2YAC|5|This app is soon great wonder how far they will go wit Valentine's day and wit the fourth of July.
B008JFUO4U|4|This movie was not at all what I expected, not having seen previews of it beforehand.  The futuristic setting was quite stylistic and the special effects were spectacular.  The story line was somewhat confusing as was the ending, but the action sequences were exciting, even if not realistic.  It does illustrate vast advances in drone technology from what we have today.  Overall a fun escapist movie to watch.
0743454537|3|WARNING: SPOILER ALERT    I was thrilled to be reading this book until the last 5 chapters when one of the main characters suffered a seizure. Ms. Picoult wrote that something was inserted into the individual's mouth while he was convulsing. This is something that should be AVOIDED when a person is having a seizure; Ms. Picoult has done an extreme disservice to her readers and people with epilepsy by illustrating this procedure in her book. I hope that no one will take the situation as truth; people who have seizures and have foreign objects placed in their mouth can seriously injure themselves and others. There is no need to place a foreign object in their mouth! How archaic and ignorant for Ms. Picoult to include that in her story.
B00CDT41RY|3|This film dragged and I felt the gore was way over the top even for Quentin Tarratino. I also felt that the story was just not well developed and the acting was predictably average. Tarratino likes to use a lot of the same actors and the one he chose for the bounty hunter who befriends Django just didn't cut it.
B0001KZM3O|5|I'm a casual Pink Floyd listener. I've seen \\"The Wall\\" and own some of their more mainstream CDs. I stumbled upon this at my local library and fell in love. Like \\"The Wall\\", it's part biography; a tribute to Water's father, who died in WWII. But it's also a meditation on the aftereffects of war.<br /><br />The album focuses on Thatcher-era England after WWII and the Falklands War, but it's also relevant to the Vietnam, Gulf, and Iraq Wars.<br /><br />\\"The Gunner's Dream\\" is a haunting tale from the point of view of a dead gunman. Parts of it remind me of \\"In Flanders Fields\\". The end, with a long, fading scream over a soft \\"In a corner of a foreign field. the gunner sleeps tonight. What's done is done.\\" packs more punch that I thought possible from a library CD.<br /><br />\\"One of the Few\\", \\"The Soldier's Return\\", and \\"Parnoid Eyes\\" are about the side of homecoming you don't see- recovery.<br /><br />The only track I realy didn't like was \\"Not Now, John\\". It's punchy and the most danceable mumber on the CD, but it doesn't seem to fit.<br /><br />Musically, the heavy strings lend a depth which makes the mood a bit dark, but not depressing. The bridge in \\"Paranoid Eyes\\" is a good example, deep and slow, but moving.<br /><br />I'd reccommend this to anyone who likes Pink Floyd or classical/rock combinations. No, it's not \\"The Wall\\", but it's good.
B00445YMME|5|My whole family really enjoyed watching this together! My daughters are 10 &12 and it was fun (and audience appropriate) for all!
B000256TD0|5|My 8 year old son and 6 year old daughter have owned this car for almost 6 months now without breaking it. Yes, they have been more careful with it then they are with other toys but I would recommended this car as one that holds up well and gives children much joy as they play with it. It is a good size, too. Not too small. Not too big.
B005GFPZYK|5|Well written and interesting. What a life and what an unfortunate death. He is a true hero in my mind.
B000065SCT|4|This movie is an incredible animation great for the whole family.  Mr. Potato Head gave an outstanding performance.
B0068853O6|5|Awesome show! Wish there were more seasons.
B00FAPF5U0|5|This game is so awesome I recommend for the people reading this post to download this game because u wont regret it u will love it
B0015DROBO|4|I didn't know what to expect when I began reading this book considering this was typically not my genre but I was completely captivated. I would recommend this book any day.
0142405809|5|My husband's aunt in Scotland sent us a Julia Donaldson book for our son and he loves it! They are fun to read for parents (let's face it, some kids books are downright annoying) and my son enjoys the vibrant illustrations and the fun flow of the rhymes. I think we now own every one of her books.
B00280LYHS|4|loved the book and the series and I am looking forward to series 2
0743298020|5|I adored this book. Read it, especially if you are a writer. It's a beautiful work with so many well-chosen adjectives you might pee yourself, and it's an interesting story to boot. I won't spoil any of it for you, but here's an excerpt of one of Ms. Setterfield's beautiful paragraphs written by one my new favorite characters of all time, Vida Winter.<br /><br />\\"My gripe is not with lovers of the truth, but with truth herself. What succor, what consolation is there in truth, compared to a story? What good is truth, at midnight, in the dark, when the wind is roaring like a bear in the chimney? What you need are the plump comforts of a story. The soothing, rocking safety of a lie.\\"
B0099Y2MYK|5|Downton Abbey continues the story begun last season. The ending was a typical British shocker. And it leaves you in suspense waiting for the next season.
B00BLCHYKU|5|I choose to give it five stars because it is a great story.  I am a history teacher and this appears to be quite accurate as far as the things we do know about the Vikings. The acting is good also.  Have always liked Gabriel Byrne and the person who plays Rathgar<br />is good.  I think we will be seeing more of him on screen.
B005RUUUAI|5|I love this show, it is done so well and has a great group of actors! Every episode is done with so much detail an character performance!
6302732786|1|Unbelievable.  Simply unbelievable.  How these \\"so called\\" video editors could cut out the very best performance of the entire concert is beyond me.  Without the show stopping performance of Extreme and their melody of Queen tunes this is just an average concert.  Whoever is responsible for cutting Extreme out of the final cut should be ashamed of themselves.  They need to find a new line of work because evidently they aren't even qualified to edit my home movies.<br /><br />What a disappointment this DVD was. :(
B000001EHS|5|It's not a surprise that they would call this cd the Def Leppard Vault.  They put most of their greatest songs in there.  I know all the songs and it's hilarious, because I stick it in my cd player in my SUV and sing right along everywhere I go...(when I'm not busy jamming out to Rob Zombie or Nine Inch Nails)  Quite a difference from what I usually listen to, but I grew up with this music.  The leaf doesn't fall far from the tree.
B0068853O6|5|Accurate!!
B00CXVX1OQ|5|If you want the.full enjoy of this game I recommend you to bay it twice: for you and for yours partner, girlfriend, etc. You can play this game against android, but the real fun is to play it over WiFi. I am playing that way, and this is really great fun ( it's much better then bluetooth).<br />Single player mode is great too.
B0012NO4WO|5|I have been wanting to share this movie with my son but was unable to find it at the local video store.  Discovered that Amazon streams movies so was able to &#34;rent&#34; this movie for 24 hours.  In terms of the movie itself, Speed was made in 1993 and most people have become used to extreme stunts but, for it's time, Speed has great stunts and a decent story line.  Even though it is rated R, I let my 12 year old watch it since the violence (a few people get shot and a couple of people do die) is not graphic.  My 20 year old daughter also had never seen the movie.  We all enjoyed it!
B004FRX0MY|5|It's good as long as it doesn't close on ya..it tells me &#34; unfortunately amazon has stopped&#34;
B00LP1MVSW|4|He was there when I started. I don't want to kill baby dinosaurs that wouldn't be a threat to me in real life, it's too sad. :(  They squeak when hit.  Lol.  (yes, I'm female, and don't like hunting for sport, games or for real). But that T Rex was darn right terrifying when I started this game!  MY HEART LITERALLY POUNDED SO MUCH I COULDN'T KILL THE DARN THING!  Lol!  Velociraptors are fun to get though...as are the pteradactyls. (?)  Pretty fun for not having to buy anything if I don't want to!
1400064287|1|This book is way too long. They could have written the whole book in one third it's volume to make it simple. The writers need to be effective. They talk about techniques like being simple, unexpected, concrete,credible, emotional& stories. However they seem to be totally lost in the countless useless information. Context is good but needs improvement on content. Definitely not recommended.
B00K2CHWYI|5|Great Movie
B003XQRZ7E|5|This is by far the best CD ever release. It is full throttle kick butt rock n roll that has it all. It is music the way it was meant to be played. The vocals are fantastic, bass is great, drums can't be better and Joe Bonamassa is the greatest guitarist in the history of mankind and his solos rock. This is an instant classic that belongs in the same category as Zeppelin's Houses of the Holy, Pink Floyd's The Wall and Guns n Roses Appetite for destruction. If you love straight up kick butt rock n roll this CD is the best there is. This CD does not deserve 5 stars it deserves 999999999999999 stars.It is head and shoulders above everyone else.
0307719774|5|I don't journal but this is a great way to put some thoughts down and to compair with previous years
0385504225|3|I admit to being a fan of Dan Brown's books and have read them all, but I waited to read this one until I could find a cheap copy at a yard sale, since the reviews have been pretty negative. I just finished reading it and I had to make myself finish the last few chapters. The ending is a real letdown and a total departure from reality. We have a character whose hand was chopped off by a madman who then tortured him in inhuman ways, but once he is rescued, his main interest is in launching a tour for Robert Langdon of some important buildings of Washington DC. Oh yes, his sister, who had been abducted and put through a terrifying experience, relaxes by going with Langdon and enjoying the view atop the Capitol Bldg. Of course, all this is by way of explaining the final \\"secret\\" of an incredibly labyrinthine series of coded messages involving a pyramid, a capstone, and a mysterious box. But wouldn't these people be so traumatized and exhausted after their all night ordeal that watching the sun come up from the top of the Capital Bldg. would not be on their list of what to do right away?<br /><br />The bad guy in this book is REALLY bad, and there is a surprise about who he really is (although it seems other reviewers figured this out on their own). I could not get my mind around this guy and found his actions kind of unbelievable. The involvement of the CIA and the urgent actions of the weird security head Sato led me to think we were going to hear about a real national security threat if the \\"secret\\" got out, but what followed was a monumental letdown. It was just more of the Washington elite protecting its own.<br /><br />What this book DID do for me though was to spark an interest in the monuments in our nation's capital. It's got me thinking about a trip to DC to see these places. This book is a reminder that our founding fathers were, in fact, Masons and their Masonic training DID influence the design of our capital city. It also must have influenced their thinking on other matters too. Dan Brown clearly did plenty of research, both on the Masons and on the buildings in Washington DC. But, interesting as it is as a city, Washington DC doesn't quite match the (for me) exotic venues in DaVinci Code or Angels and Demons.<br /><br />The stuff about blood sacrifice ended up in strange contradictions as to whether this is part of the Dark Side or the Light Side. The book also has a definite \\"Star Wars\\" scene concerning father and son. And while the Masonic rituals get a defense in this book, they are depicted as being confusing to the masses, and so must be kept secret.<br /><br />This book ended up being too preachy about stuff that did not illuminate the characters or the plot. I am familiar with a lot of the \\"science\\" of Katherine Solomon, but I doubt any of it will change the world. The experiment about a small weight loss at the moment of death is a real experiment done back in the early Twentieth Century by Duncan MaDougall, with the stated result (there is a very small weight loss of 21 grams at the moment of death), but it has not led to everyone accepting the existence of the soul. There is plenty of evidence for the continuation of consciousness after death, but it is not the kind of evidence that can be replicated on command and lots of people never inform themselves on these matters, so it has not caused a mass change of belief. Nor did Noetic Science have much to do with the plot in the same way as the revelations (speculations?) in The DaVinci Code. It just seemed like the author wanted to work in a lot of stuff about human consciousness and the oneness of the universe, but it ended up being extra baggage.<br /><br />This book would have been better if the characters had been more developed and more realistic, if the plot had taken fewer twists and turns that kept you reading more but enjoying it less, and the author had refrained from endlessly preaching to us about the coming enlightenment of mankind. Dan Brown hasplenty of advice here in these reviews, so I'll look forward to seeing what he does next.ws, so I'll look forward to seeing what he does next.
B00LXLM05I|5|This is one of the better free games.  The IAP are not necessary to have a good time.
B00DPM7TIG|5|So rarely are we presented with a book written with such imagination, made even richer by a broad vocabulary.  I recommend this book to anyone craving, desiring the opportunity to loose oneself in a book. Loved it!
1577314808|4|good book to read
B00005YW4H|4|I listened to Norah Jones first on PBS. Her story is of course interesting: she's the daughter of Ravi Shankar. Her music though is her own, and it is a bit like green wine, sweet and a bit intoxicating, but almost certain to get better with age.
B00KQ9ZW4O|5|Gremlins movie & streaming review childhood memories of sloppy joe dogs and family fun with this comedic horror classic, I loved this movie as a kid and when I watch it today it brings back pleasant memories    Many movies made in the 80's have a cozy fun feeling even when they were trying to scare the tar out of you they seemed to have a quaint simplicity and general fun feel that is hard to duplicate these days    I consider this movie more of a sci-fi horror comedy and from the moment the opening scene begins I get that cozy fun feeling that brings me back, it's just a great classic with a good story good acting performances and a cute critter name gizmo, it's one of my favorite movies made in the 80's    Amazon instant viewing experience good picture quality fairly smooth streaming on medium high speed wifi, thanks for reading my digital copy review.
B000009ED0|5|First of all buy this cd before you buy the history of rock so you can get used to him, anyway this cd is the best here are the best songs, bawitdaba I love this song and the choros, cowboy, tight song, devil without a cause,heck I like all the songs. The last thing I like about this cd is that it is a mixture between hard rock, metal, rap, oldies, and hardcore, buy this cd it kicks ...!
B00395ZYVS|5|Interesting,informational as well as a good story. Very inciteful and caring as to how it must feel to be adopted.
0670024856|1|I can't believe the rave reviews this book is getting.  I'm half way through and am giving up.  Although it did get off to a good start, the story lost its way after Alma's marriage ended and she took off for Tahiti.  The plot was contrived and banal, the characters unbelievable and I just didn't get a good sense of time and place. Three strikes.  There was so much potential here and I was very disappointed.
B0052GACNM|5|Really love this CD. Blending Tony's voice with younger artist that goes so well with him.<br />I am of the older generation and yet my college son likes this to
B001V7YJMG|5|Great story, great actor and actress.

B005LAIGN2|5|Great  history
B002N5N4M6|5|I now own all the seasons on DVD...my favorite show!  These shows are even funny when watched over and over.
B00IWULSTC|5|I will just echo much of what has already been said....This collection is ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC!!!! Was a huge fan of the original COSMOS, and this updated version takes things to a whole new and exiciting level. I just wish that this series was in 3-D...then I could really feel immersed in the stunning visuals. Extremely educational, informative, inspiring, and thought-provoking. Young people aspiring to study 'Space Science' this is a outstanding launching pad. You would never know that the dialogue was 'scripted' by the way Dr.Tyson narrates...so natural. I hope to meet him one day, as he appears to be very down-to-earth, humble, and personable.. I particularly enjoyed seeing seeing his footage at Comic-Con. I am truly looking forward to the continuing series. Far more enjoyable without the commercial breaks as well.
B00VRYCGLO|4|I enjoy it
B001NHNG64|4|Kept me reading past bedtime.  It was a good story and I always enjoy Jack Reacher!  I'm looking forward to the next one!

B009UX2YAC|4|It's easy and its fun I play all the time
B000093FLA|5|Honestly one of my favorite Jason Stathem movies and he is not even the action star in it. Brad Pitt plays such a bad ass gypsy fighter. just all around a great underrated movie
B005HED1BE|5|great
B00CBRAD2A|3|The movie was entertaining but there was a bit more blood than necessary.  Also, the language was Hollywood-crude and could have been less so.
0736430512|4|great book
B00FAPF5U0|4|Stuck on the 8th????
B003YL4LYI|5|This book as well as the fourth take a dramatic turn from the television series. A word of warning here, if you're watching the show with a group of friends - just don't talk. It's extremely easy to spoil something you thought had already been on the show.
B008RA3X5E|4|This is so Epic
0316017922|2|Summary:    In this new book by the author of \\"The Tipping Point\\" and \\"Blink\\", Outliers takes quick look at stories of success of a few well-known individuals, (\\"outliers\\", people that have done something out of the ordinary).  The book then extends that to consider groups that fit this \\"outliers\\" success measure.  Forgive that applied to a group, the \\"outlier\\" definition may arguably not apply as well.  The book looks at some of the common perceptions about factors commonly attributed to outlier success.      The purpose appears to be to open the readers perception up to consider some additional important key factors in the success of an individual or or a particular group.  The average response suggested is that genius, (high IQ) coupled with individual effort achieves extraordinary result.  The author suggests that history, culture and opportunity/circumstance have had as much a role in notable success as genius and persistence.  The persistence and hard work argument still receives considerable emphasis by the author, but genius spark is discounted through his arguments in this readers opinion.    In all, not a great book, not much scientific research to support claims but does provide some points on culture and opportunity influences outcome, (or \\"success\\").    Read it if:  Your interested in a different perspective on what makes individuals often considered \\"genius\\" successful or not.  And seek additional motivation to persist and work very hard to achieve your goals.    Skip it if: You are already a big believer that hard work and dedication is as important as a genius spark in creating a successful outcome, (of your definition of successful outcome!).    Optimist's Outlook:  There is something to be learned from the perspective of hard work, dedication and extreme preparation in achieving ones goals or in pursuit of a highly successful outcome.    Cynic's Corner:  The book is a thinly veiled manifesto supporting the KIPP school methodology and inditement ofthe American Public School system methods.
B00IMOVPUU|2|Boring
B000006TRV|2|One of the stars is for Gillmore's solo on Comfortably Numb and the other is for the song Comfortably Numb.  Great Song! However, none of the other songs come close on this too long and too dark of a CD. Ok there's some OK AM radio stuff so maybe 2.5 stars. WARNING: Don't buy this until you hear it a least a couple times. It's for special musical tastes. It's not like Dark Side or Wish.
0441017177|5|I just finished reading House of Suns, and was very impressed with the book. Mr. Reynolds has done well with this story and has shown a seeming increase in demand for academic understanding in his readers. I was at once both captivated by the character's text, and challenged to comprehend the physics and other hard-science issues of the story. There even is a tasty nugget of steampunk thrown in as well.    In this story, there are two aspects that stuck out most significantly; they being a result of my past experiences with all of Mr. Reynolds texts. The first is the story's most interesting use of changing points of view between two of the main characters. They would change unannounced between chapters; this continued to bewilder and demand my futher attention as I read. And I just realized that this may be a factor of who the main characters are, where/who they come from. If so, this is a futher interesting development in Mr. Reynolds capacity; one I welcome, as it made it very interesting. The second aspect was the increased emphasis on the temporal/time issues: of the characters, of the environment, and the increasingly advanced physical concepts woven into the storyline. I see this as a science fiction book for scientists; one that expects a certain grasp of physics, or at least the ability to conceptualize its implications (which I had to do on several enjoyable occasions myself; skein drives...uh?).    In summary, this book has reaffirmed my admiration for Mr. Reynolds and his work. This is an essential addition to all Reynolds, hard scifi, and space opera fans. The story, characters, and environment all were very rich, interesting, and mentally stimulating. Shrouds, Absences, oh my. I hope to see more from the Gentian Universe in the future. Truly epic in scale.
B003M6TVQI|5|Great TV show!
B00FAPF5U0|5|fun game. kind of like the challenge of making it to the higher levels before running out of lives. also keeps from playing to long.
B00R7FRTWI|4|Excellent story. Left you wanting to know even more about what really happened.
B00ABGEFWC|1|They get you to buy the app and then your child plays it and keeps getting billed for $4.99 for playing it. Amazon is a ripp off this should be banned
B00RY85CQI|5|This time the Academy was intelligent.
B00DVKOYBM|5|Great game. Play with friends too.
B004PGO25O|5|If you are ever smart enough to read this book you will thank yourself.  Again, he tells me what I need to know without excess or BS.
B00CWY76CC|5|.......but great fun! It is not so easy that it's not worth playing but challenging enough that that you lose interest.
B00BLCHZC2|5|Great show!
B0009P66TK|5|Good size watch/clock!  Like that it's bigger so definitely need to match the individual wearing it...no mistaking its manliness.  Really like it over my other smaller faced watches.
B00B4FU6KE|5|won't be deleting this any time soon. I have a feeling it will be read again and again. I could have read 1000 more pages.
B001NESPHC|5|Melody Gardot's music touches the soul and evokes sweet emotions of joy, reminisce, sadness and recovery. Her voice is smooth and calming, while delivering beautiful music from her heart to ours. I highly recommend that you purchase this album!

B0094BB4TW|2|If they would quit changing their layout and stick with one that doesn't suck, I'd give this a higher rating
B00A7OIXW6|5|Year after year, the expectation is that Pixar will release the best animated film, with second fiddle going to either Disney or Dreamworks.  The two possible exceptions to this trend have been Dreamworks' \\"How to Train Your Dragon\\" and Disney's \\"Tangled\\".  Now we have another alternative, \\"Wreck-It Ralph\\", Disney's big fall release of 2012.  Following in the transformation of Disney films from fairy tale musical to more focused on action and comedy, this movie contains elements from many of the other successful animated films of the past 20 - 30 years.  First, its numerous references to video games both overt and sly hearken back to the first Shrek, and to a smaller extend, the Toy Story films, in how they feature associations to culturally known icons.  The film's ensemble cast, and their relationships on stage also bear striking semblance to prior animated hits, most noticeably Monster's Inc.  Sully corresponds to Wreck-It Ralph.  Mike Wazowski becomes Fix-It Felix, and Boo is now Venellope.  The key difference is that the relationship between Sully and Wazowski in Monster's Inc is flipped 180 degrees in Wreck-It Ralph.  For me, the best part of the movie was the soundtrack; mixing elements of hip-hop, techno, disco and the traditional video game background music, it was a key part of the film's emotional punch.  As for this blu-ray / DVD package, it contains the film, the short clip that came before the movie in the theaters, and some additional features.  Like Disney's other films, the extra/deleted scenes are just sketches with voice-overs.  All in all, a great film and my vote for the best animated film of 2012.
B0073LWEXK|1|It crashes no matter what I do. I reloaded and restarted but nothing works, especially the game! I hope they fix it.
B00EGMQIJ0|5|Every person should read this book.  &#34;1984&#34; for the 21st century.
B005UG542S|5|Good movie.  Lots of twists and turns.  Typical Harry Potter action.  I will watch it again!<br />Probably not a good choice for little kids, it's a bit scary!
B00DXLO0D6|5|So super excited to receive my I Dream of Jeannie DVD set.  Memories of my childhood all in that box set!!
B0040I09RM|5|Extraordinary, powerful and riveting.
B00H71PHS0|5|Can't wait for Season 5 to begin  
0446677450|5|Mr. Kiyosaki's book is one of the most amazing books I have ever read. I have had numerous self-help/financial planning books cross my path, but none with the simple and painfuly obvious truths displayed in this one. If you truely want to learn how to get rich then this book should be your first step.
B00DHQHAH0|4|I loved to watch this season of suite. Harvy and Mike great team. good story and well presented. keep up...
B004GYY714|5|I've been wanting 2 listen to Radio Disney wich u can on this app but I also found a radio station out of Australia. If u want to listen to the radio this is the app 2 do it with. BEST radio app ever.
B00FAI2IUM|3|It's free and it is pretty fun.<br />my tablet couldn't play it properly but it is a fun game.<br />I liked that you could set graphic settings to adjust for performance.
0345530578|2|Not his best.
B00OH74BXY|5|Great movie
B008JFUQ3O|5|A great movie that captures the fun that was in the first one and does it justice in the continuation of the story.  A little something for all ages and a great family movie.
B004YW4L5K|3|While normally not intimidated by a novel's size, this one gave me great problems. I had to read Anansi Boys twice before I really understood it, but American Gods took me four tries. It was a bit frustrating, because usually I consider myself to be easily able to comprehend literature.<br />That aside though, if you can keep up with complex plotlines it is a good read. I quote this book very often, particularly, &#34;Tell them. Tell them language is a virus and religion is an operating system and prayers are just so much f---ing spam.&#34;<br />the overall theme - which i gathered to be about spiritualism replaced by secularism - is a dsep and solid one.<br />If you are prepared to invest some time, I would definitely recommend this book!
039334407X|5|amazing!! Nicole Kidman is sublime and Colin Firth fantastic
B008XG1X18|5|you can get a lot of ideals and find some really great bloggers
B00479SVBU|5|I didn't even know this unit was available until a friend told me about it. The car I have is 13years old and does not have a USB port so to be able to have something like this is great. Very simple to set up and ease of use couldn't be better. Will definitely tell others about it. Thanks
B000003S0P|5|Toward the end of 1974, this would be King Crimson's last album of the 70's. King Crimson was a band that defied description and form. On one song you get hit with chords, beats that dazzle and on another song you get lured into a lull where you think you're safe. As one person describes &quot;Red,&quot; it is like the music is stomping and marching. I feel that this album was ahead of its time, making one wonder what if King Crimson continued right after &quot;Red&quot;?
B002LAM7PI|4|Very well done movie. It has some quite dark concepts but they are presented in such a way as to not eclipse the actual story. As an adult I had a lot of fun and its just scary enough to build tension without resulting in kids having nightmares.
B008Y7N7JW|4|Held off from watching this for a long time but it was not as bad as I thought it would be. A lot of youngsters in this but it's better than watching anyone of those Twilight films.
B00C8S9W0G|5|I never get tired of the outlander serious. Just an excellent read. Diana you did it again :) I just loved it.
B004O3YGMC|5|I have been able to log in both from within my network and via the Internet. Really cool! This will be very useful, thanks.
B004FRX0MY|3|Amazon prime music app still needs to be polished up. It is not very intuitive. It does not always do what I was expecting. Also I would like to make a station a favorite but wasn't clear if that can be done. Once again not a well thought out app.
B00003CXBK|5|My fiancé was so excited to get this DVD for Valentine's Day. We haven't watched it yet but we will soon.
B00KWN33K4|5|I was not interested in the series<br />I just started it and I love it...actually I enjoy the concept of watching it on my own time. The experience is more intimate.
B009O2XY12|1|Had a lot of fun playing, and challenging once advancing... normally I wouldn't pay to play, but got stuck on a difficult level and decided to pay .99 cents for some &quot;help,&quot; BUT INSTEAD GOT THROWN OUT OF THE GAME I WAS PLAYING, AND I STILL GOT CHARGED FOR THE HELP I NEVER RECEIVED.  Needless to say, I won't be playing anymore.
B00STX2UB2|5|A great story with more twist than a pretzel.
B001EBWING|5|I loved this movie. First time seeing it.  The acting was top notch. Loved the clothes. What a classic  Will watch it again
B002W7J3SO|5|Timeless favorite.
0446310786|5|It's a classic for a reason. I loved this book. My 11 year old now wants to read it now, too.
B005IQZB14|2|This story of self discovery was hard to read at times. The author makes decisions that made no  sense to me and that she knew were self destructive. However, I respect the journey she took and completed.
B0012GVKVY|5|Caught this other day on My38 TV, which inspired me to write a review. I loved it when it first came out, and it still holds up incredibly well today (2012). I feel that this is Will Smith's best movie, and I think it's pretty cool that he's always been happy to star in science fiction movies, even though he could limit his roles to other genres, if he chose.<br /><br />Although many people have complained that the film of \\"I, Robot\\" bears very little resemblance to the Asimove story (which is true), I think that the writer who adapted it for the screen actually did a very good job. Though the narrative is radically different, what remains is the CORE of Asimov's story, that being the Three Laws of Robotics, and Man's impending fear of domination, as artificial intelligence improves. The movie makes sense by contemporary standards, and therefore, the themes of the story can be effectively conveyed to the audience.<br /><br />Also noteworthy is that the CGI in this movie is topnotch, and the robots have the perfect blend of slickness and creepiness, establishing the notion that they are a thing that humans have come to live with and rely upon in this future, yet humanity has become fearful that this trust is misplaced.
B00J11U4T6|5|Very intriguing will probably watch it over again.
B00VRYCGLO|5|I'm addictive!
B00C74SHRK|3|I have 25% to read and I don't know if I am going to finish it! Enjoyed most of it so far but not really keen on Boris and his friends
B005BZQTGS|2|ALERT: SOME VAGUE REVEALS!    I had very high hopes for this film based on the previews and trailers. As a die-hard rennie, this looked like my sort of romp.    But the fact is that crude humor needs more than mere crudeness to be funny. And most of the time, all that one got here was mere crudeness. The timing of the film was consistently off, so that what should have been fast delivery often dragged. The repartee and banter that should have been at machine-gun pace instead waited for someone to crank the crossbow back for another shot. (Best metaphor I could squeeze out on short notice; sorry ... ) The action sequences were long in coming and, often times short on the delivery. And, dear lord, the musical scene made me want to put an ice-pick in my ears. It too went on far longer than it should have.    There were some good moments, though, and they deserve mention as well. The direct interactions between the brothers was often good, and sometimes even touching. The pacing improved as the film went on, especially after the abduction, although that improvement was slow in coming.    Still, at the end of the day, this is not a film I'll want to own on disk. And given the nature of its theme and my tastes (or lack thereof) that is really disappointing.
B00GD6DZGG|5|I love if it is so super funny I would give it  100 stars if I could
0440224764|4|I totally enjoyed this book until I got to the ending. Maybe, I just a  love sick puppy but I was disappointed in the ending. I always love John Grisham books.
B00AA7O6QC|5|My wife wouldn't watch it if I paid her $100 but I thought it was great.  I had to rent it while she was out doing other things.:)
B0009W5JS2|5|Hey you know what people this is a movie I hear everyone say its was cheap ( lame if you will ) I loved it would have been better with deisel but I've liked him ever sence fast and furious. This is a mans movie EXPLOSINS, Cars, and everthing else. If you want a good movie and you a real man watch the new Xxx ( not the dirty ones as good as they are ). WHY BLOW UP THE GTO!!! that is the only bad part. I will buy this. I can't wait.
B003XQM2YU|5|A new view to an old story.  And no damsel in distress, Lady Marion rides at his side.  Worth it!
B004QK5N5W|5|With this product, I can easily translate my iPad screen onto my TV screen -- works well for streaming movies, photos, and TV shows.<br /><br />Pros: This product enables you to have your iPad connected to your TV, but also allows you to keep your iPad charger plugged in if you need to charge your battery<br /><br />Remember: Not a huge thing, just realize you need to also own (or purchase) an HDMI cable to plug into your TV!
B00BLCHZC2|5|Great show about history
B00009V8Z9|5|when i listened to this CD, it described many situations of a love life and typical relationship stories. the music is very relaxing and good to listen to. i enjoy all of the tracks and the lyrics are awesome. it's one of those cd's that put you in the mood to listne to.if you like jason mraz or guster you will definately love this cd, it's a must have!!!!
B003EYVXVY|1|Well I thaught I was buying the DVD plus blueray and digital copy and was upset that I paid so much for just the 3d disc and now they are in the stores for less than half the price I bought it off of amazon for
B005S9EKCW|1|The DVD is REGION 1 and then I can´t play it because I live in Europe (Region 2).<br /><br />Be very careful about this, because the information in the web is wrong.<br /><br />Greeting from Europe.
B001V9LRV0|4|I'm going to be as down to the point as I possibly can with this review because ultimately that's what you, the reader, are going to want to know.  So here it goes:<br /><br />PROS OF THIS NEW DVD SET:<br /><br />1. The picture and sound quality have never looked or sounded better!<br />2. Great bonus disc with many great, ROCKING, unreleased performances!<br />3. Amazon offers a second bonus disc with three more performances!<br />4. The extra features on all three discs are informative about the festival!<br />5. The package design is inventive and fun! The Life magazine reprint is awesome!<br /><br />CONS OF THIS NEW DVD SET:<br /><br />1. Not too crazy about the \\"boxing\\" on the full screen sections of the film!<br />2. THERE WAS 100% NO NEED FOR A LOUSY 30+ MINUTE JAM FROM THE GRATEFUL DEAD!  I love The Dead, but this is just a freaking bore!<br />3. No extras of Janis, Sly, Ten Years After, Arlo Guthrie, and no first time seen performances of Bert Sommer, Quill, Incredible String Band, or The Band.<br />4. The Amazon and Target exclusive bonus discs contain two separate sets of performances.<br />5. I WANNA SEE MORE SHA NA NA!<br /><br />So there ya go!  That's my take on the new remastered DVD set of \\"Woodstock.\\"  Do you find this helpful?
0545265355|5|This book is exhilarating! You will want to keep on reading. The Hunger Games is by far my favorite. If you saw the movie you will love the book even more. Then scenes are more descriptive and paints a more lucid picture of what should have happened. For instance, the movie never explained that the wild beasts at the end are actually the dead tributes, and that rue is a little wild beast will furious petite eyes. Have fun reading people
0385340540|3|The 1st 2 chapters are great, the last 2 chapters are great.  But the middle 30 are a monotonous tour of Italy.  Cut this book in half & you would have a fantastic short story.  Joel Backman's intriguing character keeps you turning the pages of an otherwise boring novel.
B00B2V66VS|5|great game always
B007ZGO7EM|5|Works great, has all the applications I need.
B007V2UGPE|5|This is one of the awesomest games I have ever played, no matter what anybody else thinks. (Anyone who thinks game sucks, you're a loser)
B009AZZEU2|5|I've been searching for a new band in the alt-rock genre for quite some time now, and I do believe that Soundgarden fills this niche very easily. I had never, eeeever heard of Soundgarden prior to King Animal, probably because they are a brand-new band, but that's beside the point. After a few spins of King Animal, I must confess that I adore the band's chuga-chuga riffs, its very slow alt-rock sounds that reflect its middle age, and its guitar solos that make me mentally relive the finest moments I've ever spent on Guitar Hero. Surely, this awesome band will save music from the lame bands like Metallica, Tool and Queen.<br /><br />Ironically, Soundgarden is from Puget Sound, which is where the grunge explosion happened some 20 years ago. I guess Kris Cornell and company are a bunch of Johnnys-come-lately, huh? Anywho, I do commend Cornell for trying really hard to sound like a really good alt-rock singer, but he's no match to the lead singer of the Kings of Leon, whose voice just explodes with captivating urgency and hits all the high notes properly. Still, Cornell is a bit old to try to be an alt-rock singer (about 50), which makes me wonder what career he had before entering music at this old age. Anyway, I think the bass player is pretty decent, but he can sure take lessons from the bass players of the backing bands of the Jonas Bros. and Miley Cyrus because something about his bass just sounds off. Instead of going thubba-thubba-thubba, Soundgarden's bassist plays the bass incorrectly by making it go dumb-dumb-dumb!!<br /><br />Still, I found a few good songs on this CD, which means that I will be taking it with me to my next AA meeting. Been Away Too Long is your classic, hardcore alt-rock-emo offering that could have been and should have been on the last CD of Bullet For My Valentine. I still can't get its woo-woo choruses and its one-chord progressions out of my head; it is that catchy. Other winners include Taree and Blood on the Valley Floor, both of which tackle the pressing, topical issues of Democrat women who are having their birth control taken away by no-sex-before-marriage Republicans. All in all, I'd say these songs are a good effort by a first-time band!<br /><br />I hope that Soundgarden keeps plugging away at it and puts out more and more CDs in the future. They do sound promising because they picked the right genre, alt-rock-emo, in which to make their debut. However, I hope that they'll continue to improve their sound by adding some autotune in the future, along with some Glee cast members singing backup vocals.tackle the pressing, topical issues of Democrat women who are having their birth control taken away by no-sex-before-marriage Republicans.

0743298020|5|I chose this book for my book club group and I must say this was an excellent choice. I found that I simply could not put this book down.   It's the sort of story that stays with you and I can't get the characters out of my mind.  Now I have to allow a few weeks before reading my next book. Fabulous!! I'm looking forward to Diane Setterfield's next book.
B00I3ULVLQ|4|The case looks very good on my samsung galaxy s5. One problem that I noticed is that sometimes I have to take it off the case to turn on my phone. I guess as I continue to use it that the case would become soft enough so that I don't have to remove the case to turn on the phone
B0064TVQ5E|5|enjoying it very much
B003KRLKHC|5|Excellent movie, well acted by Washington as is typical, and the surprise at the end is totally unexpected and pretty awesome.
B00AEBBA1I|5|got here on time  loved it.
0425252868|5|Excellent book with incredible meaning!  I loved it and have recommended it to many of my friends and co-workers at the VA Hospital
B009UQCD0K|5|This has become one of my favorite TV shows since they have taken the zombie genre and crashed past its limits in a truly explosive fashion. This started as a survival horror show, in which the people were pretty much trying to stay alive while avoiding the walkers, but it has morphed into so much more. In this season, the zombies are still there, but they have pretty much become part of the scenery. Yes, they are still dangerous and become a problem in cases, but the much bigger threat comes from other humans. We have the old issues rising up in this new world, where greed, self-interest and the us vs. them mentality rules the day.<br /><br />One of the aspects of this series I enjoy the most is the growth of the characters, especially Rich, who by virtue of being the leader of his group has to not only think about his immediate family, but also his extended one. This leads him to make many decisions that go against what he used to believe in when he was a cop in his previous life, and the effects are sometimes dramatic. As has been the case previously, the creators of the series have no qualms in killing off important characters, so you'd be best served to not get too attached to any of them in particular. I thoroughly enjoy this level of uncertainty when watching a series.<br /><br />Having been reading the graphic novel too, I really like how they have changed the story in the TV series. This has pretty much given me two zombie stories instead of one repeated across two different mediums. Some of the basic elements of the plot are similar, but the characters, who dies and who lives, and how certain key stories develop are all different. If you have not checked out the graphic novel do yourself a favor and try it out too.<br /><br />I am looking forward to the 4th season of this series, it cannot come fast enough!
B001CDWFPC|5|There are explicit instructions to get to the individual scriptures and shortcuts as well as a good table of contents to get to anything you want in this bible. What is necessary to do in the very beginning of this bible is to learn the two or three leter abbreviations for each book of this bible. After studying the instructions and learning the abbreviations it is a breeze to navigate. The instructions are a must. If you do not read \\"How to use this Bible on Kindle, the tricks of the text will be hidden from you. It is no more difficult than the easiest video game I have ever used.  If you do your homework, it is a good choice for the Kindle version. The charts were a disappointment because they are not programmed for the Kindle, but there are websites you can go to for them. The difference in price is more than compensorate and the lack of girth in the book makes it easy to carry anywhere I go. I Love this Bible!
B004478GNI|5|This is the 1st Lego I ever bought and it was just simply fun and awesome to build it, even if ur not a fan of star wars u will still like it I have boughten many other star wars legos and its Been pretty fun
B0017I1FO4|5|One of the best cd's ive bought in a long time. Every song is great and worth the buy!! ENJOY
B00H8C4HZ2|3|I understand that Hollywood sometimes needs to take liberty with the facts to make movies watchable, but this one goes over the line.  It is so predictable that JFK would be the hero and Reagan the villain, but this is from people who cast Jane Fonda as Nancy Reagan... really?  The scene where a white southerner murders a man in front of his family, probably could have happened somewhere in the south, but it never happened to a White House butler.  This movie is watchable, but it is NOT a history lesson. The dictionary defines Propaganda as &#34;information, esp. of a biased or misleading nature, used to promote or publicize a particular political cause or point of view&#34;.  I rest my case.
B00FFT1BJ0|5|This cam on time and my husband love's this gift.
B005GIS1SY|4|This is a great children's movie with little negativity and an exciting storyline. I have a 4 yr old who is sensitive to &#34;scary&#34; Disney movies. This was a really great option for her. The graffix are beautiful and is overall a good quality movie!
B00L23SE52|4|Ok
B008MG1E4A|5|I have never wrote a review for a book before but let me just say....WOW!! This was an excellent book and was extremely interesting.  I did not realize the training that these military men/women go through on a daily basis to fight for our country.  This book is not only about the killing of Osama Bin Laden but also about other missions they have been on.  I started this book and did not want to put it down...Very intriguing.
B008C20TDG|5|If you are wanting to change your nutrition and stop eating chemicals this book lays it all out.  Highly recommend.
B00FWLSOOG|5|Absolutely worth watching. Amazing graphics. Great movie to own. Story line didn't really touch me, but the fact of giant robots fighting aliens was worth of the purchasing.
B00JB3NUHM|1|Awful. Silly and not anything similar to the story of Noah. I couldn't even finish it. Probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
B003L20IJM|5|Great family movie. We all need a nanny McPhee.
B00A8ECU24|5|Love it!
B008JFUQ16|5|I bought 2 copies of this movie because its one of my nehews' favorite.  So I wanted a copy for our house.  The first and second one are so cute.  They watch it as their bedtime movie and I always watch it with them because I think they are cute movies.
B00BHHIWQO|5|This is a great game to play .You try to bet your high scrore with everyone on facebook.to see who is number one.
B00CNQ7HAU|5|Grisham mixes another stew of usual ingredients [ down south law,, black and white overtones, dumb lawyers, atypical juries] and a great story line that ends happily.As usual, did not disappoint!!<br />PHIL BUCK
B00HVJB4VM|5|Excellent  Well written and fascinating to read.  Clarifies information not taught in schools in the US. Want to see the movie.
B001L5SXQG|5|Not quite as good as Magic (IMO), but damn somebody show me another rocker pushing 60 making anything this good.  My only major quible, I wish Bruce would stop with the F bombs already, your a great writer Bruce, leave the cussin to 20 yo rappers please.  Otherwise a great album, and a nice DVD that comes with (the \\"Night with the Jersey Devil\\" vid is a hoot).  Cant wait to see Bruce and the ESB in Philly in April.
B000LPS4BG|5|One of my favorite movies, fast shipping excellent packaging. Had to get it on blu ray!  Can't wait to watch it with my sin in law who's never seen it.  Thanks
B00FPC1RF0|5|A good quick read with a story which makes you think about your life's journey. Read this book, then read &#34;the pilgrimage&#34;. A good pair of books from Paulo Coelho.
B002SSUQFG|5|I was shopping around for a while, looking for a nice everyday watch ( I haven’t owned one since I was a kid), and I settled with this Seiko. Overall it’s a great find for the price, and an automatic at that, it seems to keep good time, I haven’t had any issues thus far. The band is comfortable, and has about 10 eyelets, so it’s really easy to get a nice fit. The size of the face isn't that big, but I was anticipating that, it looks great on my wrist. If you are second guessing this watch, get it, let me be the voice of reason, it really is a great watch, I have had it for about two weeks, and with taking it off during the evenings, it has not stopped once. I even had a doctor at work complement it at work, he made me take it off so he could look at it.
B0091I7FEQ|2|The kindle version doesn't format properly on the iPad.  The code snippets are very difficult to read because of it.  The web reader works fine but the book is too big to download for offline reading with for some might not be a big deal but is a problem for me.  I ended up returning it.  If I get this book again I'll be getting it in print.
B00APJLFEG|4|I am a full grown adult and I watched this movie with my 14-year old son. We both loved it! Great storyline and lots of laughs.
B00000J7J4|4|After a long downhill run beginning in the 80's, Santana came back with unbelievable force into the music mainstream with the 1999 release Supernatural.  The album gave the band numerous Grammy Awards, and A LOT of recognition and a sort of rebirth of interest in the classic Santana songs.   <br />Supernatural is the first of three albums in which Santana collaborates with numerous artists.  Being the first, it was somewhat revolutionary and very creative at the time.  However, it's sequels Shaman and All That I Am have overused the concept of making duets with other artists. <br />The music of Supernatural is mixed.  The best songs are the ones performed by the Santana band by itself.  Da Le (Ya Leo) is one of the best in the whole album, along with Migra and Africa Mamba.  <br />Corazon Espinado, Put Your Lights On, The Calling, and Do You Like The Way are some of the best collaborations with other artists.   <br />Some songs are way too radio friendly, counting more as pop than classic Santana. (e.g. Smooth, Maria Maria.)   <br />Overall, this album is recommended.  Carlos soars on guitar and Raul Rekow and Karl Perazzo play percussion masterfully.  Chester Thompson is somewhat dwarfed by everyone else, being seldom heard throughout the album, having almost no keyboard solo's in the songs, and one the keys to a great Santana sound is having a solid keyboardist. <br />
0689835604|4|Very cute lift the flap book and pages can be wiped off from sticky hands.
B009G41CG2|1|There is no Shuffle capability on this.  There are no Hints given.  If you run out of moves, it doesn't tell you--you just have to search and search and search and then finally realize that you're done.  Not fun!!  I deleted this off my Kindle after playing it four times.
B00R2Z3SZA|5|I enjoyed this movie , the turtles were perfectly different in looks as well as personalities. a lot of fun I am looking forward to the next installment. however my grands were not impressed with the female co star, they did not like her acting. they have seen all turtle movies and cartoons. so they are GOOD critics.
B005FISBTO|5|Dexter continues to excel in storylines, acting and all around performance.  The price was very reasonable as well as low shipping costs.  Sound and picture quality great.  If you like Dexter, I would recommend The Following, which is a new series on the Fox network.  It's awesome!
B0084B5TK8|5|This was one of the first classic novels I ever read, at age 12. \\"Dracula\\" started within me a lifelong love of literature, and good story telling, ( and left me sleeping with the lights on for a week afterward.) Bram Stoker does not romanticize the vampire, which may not sit well with younger readers. This story does not make a person long for the wretched existence that his undead creations experience. His vampires neither \\"sparkle\\" nor burn in the sunlight, but they are stronger at night. DRACULA does not fall in love with his victims. He is not wanting to reunite with the reincarnated soul of his long dead wife.  He is only seeking to expand his \\"territory\\" as he did in life. DRACULA practiced necromancy in his human life in an attempt to extend life beyond the death of his human body, and succeeded, but as a changed being. He infects his prey, and a dead victim becomes a lovely killing machine - a predator, devoid of humanity. These Fledgling vampire creations lose most of their personality, along with their empathy, and their immortal soul. As vampire lore goes, these demonic  creatures are infinitely creepier than the sexy, appealing \\"True Blood\\" and \\"Twillight\\" vampires, (who retain a sense of self.)
0307454541|5|I finished this book last month, but wanted to reflect a bit before writing this review.  Sure enough, the book really stayed with me, so here I am at my keyboard recommending it to others.  What I loved about this book was its multilayered and original (even quirky) plot.  This is an unconventional book, and as I was reading along, I wasn't sure where it would go; in fact, I wasn't even sure who the protagonist was.  There's a whodunit in here, but that's not really the book's focus or (in my opinion) its strength.  Rather, the real pleasure of this book is just letting it carry you along in a journey through some unusual (but still believable) lives.  I'm glad I didn't judge this book by its title, which seems just as quirky as everything else in the book (although I suspect the significance of the title may become clearer once I read the second and third books in the series, which I now intend to do).  No matter how you feel about tattoos, don't let the title turn you off; this book quickly draws you in and doesn't let you down.  And even though this offbeat Swedish thriller is a runaway bestseller, it still makes you feel kind of cool (the way that seeing the movie \\"Diva\\" felt back in the 80s).

B0086700CM|5|Didn't think I'd enjoy a Kindle game as much as I enjoy Temple Run. I'm not a young person, but I play TR every day. It's a great stress tamer and lots of fun. Thanks,  Imangi.
B0071XO8RA|5|Even if you aren't drawn to science fiction, this is a story that will compel you to read it even when you think you don't have time to read.  It will wrap your thoughts into a warm and fuzzy ball of wool; one that can only be untangled by reading through to the end of the story and ultimately towards the end of this intriguing series.
B00I8Q77Y0|4|I've just downloaded this app and ive had a lot of fun. So far with it<br />..... I think that it is really funny that the birds poop. Hahaha
B00G4Q3NDA|5|another movie that could wait to watch at home
B00003CXCQ|5|One of the most important films ever.  An amazing achievement in animation and storytelling.  It is because of movies like this that I tolerate Disney's horrible influence on our culture.
B0069G5Z9K|5|Hi Dilila. I'm 10. And Jetpack joyride is the most favorite game out of all of them all
B005RJ6AIK|5|Beautiful, soulful,and soothing this CD of real Hawaiian music is the perfect antidote when modern, technology-laden living feels frenzied and frantic. I haven't seen the movie, but the recent books Unfamiliar Fishes and Lost Kingdom inspired me to investigate the unique music of the only state that was ever a sovereign nation.
B00C1C0WCQ|5|good
B008BQ8VOC|4|The two leads in this show are great, and I really enjoy the supporting cast just as much. This is a light hearted dramedy in the vein of White Collar. If you like that show you will like this one as well. Worth a watch if you are looking for a summer distraction.
1476729093|4|The main character is very different from what we would call &#34;normal people&#34; but gives great incite into a very intelligent person.  Great fun in see how two very different people complement each other and can share a life and appreciate their differences.
B00EMXBDMA|5|This is the best book I have read this year.  It is so well written and so full of credible details that it seems like a documentary of something that happened.  This person knows NASA and space travel, as well as a whole slew of scientific trivia about Mars, potatoes, chemistry, physics, and psychology, better than anybody can imagine.  This is worthwhile reading and a page turner.  I could not put this book down. It is that good.
B007VUA7VO|5|Like it easy to use. Alerts for recharge. Lots of colors. Need it, get it, got it, GOOD!! Blah blah!
B00E8KLWB4|4|Good graphics and puzzles and can be played without add on purchases.
B000003CM9|5|Classic Allman Brothers...I never tire listening to this album....Southern blues/rock at it's finest...
B0052SF6CM|5|Great compilation from Calvin Harris. I have heard his music the last few years on Sirius Station 52 BPM and finally it is<br />mainstreaming
B004SBQGHS|5|Not a waste of money. Really great game. Not a waste of money. You need to by it because its a fun game.buy it.
B000XR4OC0|5|I ordered my actual size because the reviews said it is true to fit. It was a little too big so I returned it and got a half size smaller. It is a bit small but I'm hoping it will stretch. I also like the fact that they will give shoes to a child in need with every purchase.
B001EYGOEM|4|I'm the last person you'd expect to enjoy Taylor Swift's music--I'm a teenage boy, a drummer, and a guy who the majority of the time likes experimental and adventurous pop music (that exists in the realm of indie rock/pop). But, to be honest, I kinda like Taylor Swift. She crafts songs that, to quote Rolling Stone magazine, \\"sound like they were scientifically engineered in a hit-factory\\". That being said, this album doesn't feel processed or artificial despite the heavy Auto-Tuning and slick production. Seriously, contrary to popular belief, every female singer doesn't have to be a frickin' diva! This seems to be where all the hatred towards Swift and her music stems from. The reality is, Taylor can sell records and write heartfelt songs. In my humble opinion, those are the best things any artist can do (regardless if they are able to sing their songs perfectly in-tune on stage). Fearless is a darn good record: one that shows that Swift already has the musical cred to continue what she is doing now, but as long as her lyrics are this poor of quality, she's gonna have a difficult time truly crossing over to most serious music lovers. You might be wondering that, with all the negative comments I've made, I would rate this album poorly, but the fact is is that I find myself singing along to these songs (embarrassingly enough)...and, well, that's how impressive Taylor Swift is. :) She roped me in from the title track and held me all the way through to the final song. As far as mainstream pop music goes, this is pretty much a winner!
6305265488|5|I have watched this movie many times.  I has everything except it should be much longer.  I classify the movie as drama although some parts are funny.  At times you will be angry at the treatment of Danielle (Cinderella)from her stepmother, sister, and even the Prince.  However, justice prevails and the ending leaves you feeling good.
B00F6Y3FKW|5|Hardcore Dylan oldies may not find this to be a great value because they already own most of this. But to the uncle who just played Blonde on Blonde for his nephew and saw the light go on in his eyes, this could be an ideal gift for the next generation fan. Dylan was as influential as any musical artist of his time. This is a superb collection. 41 albums and more. Great value.
B00C8RFJBI|5|If you have the first 4 DVDS , then you have to get Fast Five. This DVD has action from start to finish, and the ending tells you there will be another.
B00BD99JMW|4|The entire series was conceptually interesting. I read it to keep abreast of popular culture to prepare myself for the extended release of the films. I saw the first film before I read the books, and I just wanted to know more of the primary character's inner life. The author was very honest and direct about Tris' story arc. Also, as a born-and-bred Chicagoan, I was intrigued by its dystopian future.
B0049P1N3K|5|I dont give much credit to anything that critics, skeptics and non- believers may say about this book. The knowledge and information in this book is changing my life and my daughters life, and i think it could change the entire world as we know it, for the better, if everyone read it.There simply is no argument against the power of love.. this book should be required reading for our kids.
B0086700CM|4|I am in love with this game. Its a fun (but super addictive game)  but it might get you mad, because it freezes after a while. But still fun.
B00005A3KS|3|The other day I decided to pop in my DVD copy of Point Break, the movie that I believe was Keanu Reeves's coming out party as the worst actor of our generation. True, more people may know him from the two Bill & Ted movies, and now from the Matrix, but Point Break was his real breakout role. In Bill & Ted, Keanu plays an idiot; i.e. he plays himself. The real comedy comes when he tries to act in serious roles, beginning with his star turn opposite Patrick Swayze in Point Break.<br /><br />There is no getting past the hilarity in a preposterous movie that tries to take itself seriously. Keanu Reeves stars as Johnny Utah, a Midwestern boy two years removed from leading his college football team to the Rose Bowl as the star quarterback. He has just set foot in Los Angeles to begin a career in the FBI unit that investigates bank robberies. He is assigned to partner with 20 year veteran Angelo Pappas, who is annoyed to be \\"babysitting some quarterback punk.\\" Pappas is played by the immortal Gary Busey.<br /><br />When you cast Keanu and Gary Busey, you already know that the movie is going to be ridiculous. Gary Busey is known as That Guy who was the bad guy in Under Siege, the crazy army guy in Black Sheep, the aging Cubs pitcher who dates Henry Roengarter's mom in Rookie of the Year, and also formerly known as That Guy who looks like Nick Nolte, although now I would say he is more famous and more entertaining than Nolte. Busey has gone from \\"That Guy\\" status to \\"Caricature of Himself\\" status, and to completely do him justice, he would need his own column.<br /><br />Before moving on, we need some Gary Busey quotes from this movie:<br /><br />\\"When they run they dump the vehicle and they vanish... like a virgin on prom night. I mean they vanish, swishh...\\"<br /><br />\\"Listen you snot-nose little [poop], I was takin' shrapnel in Khe Sanh when you were crappin' in your hands and rubbin' it on your face.\\"<br /><br />\\"22 years. Man, L.A. has changed a lot during that time. The air got dirty and the sex got clean.\\"<br /><br />\\"Let me tell you something, Harp. I was in this bureau while you were still popping zits on your funny face and [blank] off to the lingerie section of the Sears catalog.\\"<br /><br />\\"I'm so hungry I could eat the [butt] end out of a dead rhino, I should have had you get me three of these things!\\"<br /><br />Anyways, there is a group of bank robbers called the ex-presidents. Gary Busey thinks that they are surfers, since they only rob during the summer months, and one of the guys mooned the security camera during their last robbery, and he has a surfers tan. So, Keanu goes undercover and heads for the beach, to learn to surf and try to get in with the surfer dudes, with the hope of finding the bank robber gang. Of course, there is a girl (That Girl who plays the younger sister in A League of Their Own) who teaches Keanu how to surf, but more importantly, become the token romantic interest who of course has a tie-in to the bad guys.<br /><br />Or, are they bad guys? We meet a band of surfers, with the leader a dude named Bodhi, played by Mr. Dirty Dancing himself, Patrick Swayze, with a little facial stubble and blond curls. There is the requisite male bonding between Keanu and Bodhi, mystical bull about being one with the waves, and the movie forgets that it is starring Keanu Reeves, and tries to be deep with Bodhi (after we find out-as if we didn't know-that he and his buddies are the Ex-Presidents) giving a speech about how corporate America is the real bad guy, and they are the ones who are really living life by being rebels, searching out the next wave, and blah blah blah.<br /><br />It won't be giving anything away to say that Bodhi and his boys find out that Keanu is an undercover cop, so they take him along for sky-diving (cue cheap symbolism) and let him join in with the Ex-Presidents on their next robbery; a rush Keanu won't pass on since Bodhi has the girlfriend under captive somewhere else. Things go badduring the robbery, and Bodhi and his two surviving bodacious dudes are on the run, with Keanu and Gary Busey on the trail. Busey (the real star, in my opinion, not only of this movie, but of every movie he graces his over caffeinated [over-coked?] self in) gets killed as Keanu won't allow him to shoot Bodhi, since he knows Bodhi must be kept free until the girlfriend is found. We have another skydiving scene, this time with Keanu not using the brain he doesn't have and jumping out of the plane without a parachute and catching onto Bodhi. We have reached our climatic moment-will Keanu, holding onto Bodhi, drop his gun and pull the parachute string at the last minute? A good movie might have allowed us to doubt what would happen.<br /><br />Bodhi goes on his way, and releases the girl to Keanu. The movie can't end here, though. We have to jump ahead 6 months to an approaching tsunami in Australia. Bodhi is ready to ride the wave of the century, and Keanu arrives on the scene to arrest him. Keanu cements his place as the worst actor of our generation with lines such as \\"You crossed the line. People trusted you and they died. You gotta go down\\" and THE line that shows Keanu's (limited) acting rang and (sadly) his jump into stardom, \\"I'm an EFF BEE EYE agent!\\" Will Keanu arrest Bodhi and bring him in, or let him have his one shot riding the wave of the century? Once again, this movie leaves no doubt.<br /><br />Point Break was terrible, yet very entertaining. Like the ghettho-ized Bad News Bears rip-off Hardball, and the so bad and clich&eacute;d its unintentionally funny The Replacements, Keanu Reeves always manages to make movie-going quite an experience. I'd like to say to you, Keanu, and I think I speak for many, vaya con dios, bro.<br /><br />San Dimas football rules!!ve somewhere else.

1603425381|5|I'm so happy with this purchase! I'm an intermediate crocheter and was looking for more borders for flannel receiving blankets. I've been super disappointed with what's out there. I love that this book is in color; the photograph of each border is large enough that you can really see detail and the instructions are very clear. In addition, the ideas for combining colors really opened my eyes to new possibilities.<br /><br />One of my favorite features is that the author gives you the number your base row needs to be divisible by for the pattern to work. I'm not actually working with a hard corner but a rounded one and just ignored the corner instructions but it's nice to know they'll be there when I need them.<br /><br />The book itself is an odd size (8.5\\" by 6\\") but it is easy to prop open or put in a book stand close by because it's made of such heavy stock. I actually photocopied the one I was working with for ease of transport and use.<br /><br />I don't think I'll need to look elsewhere for edgings for a very long time.
B000SEGUDE|5|Great but the ending was a little disappointing. Still, it was a good read and worth it for anyone who like intertwining stories.
B007FEFLTO|5|Ken Follett is probably my favorite author.  Whether it is a spy story or an historic novel, he never fails to keep my attention.  This is just another of his many masterpieces.
B002GJT4YQ|5|This is the extended version I was looking for, so happy to have it, with all those scene's that are missing from the other dvd's
B00C7KXUOE|5|I love the show it is very intelligently written
1592332803|5|I have probably made at least half of all of the recipes in this book, and not one has come out bad.  My entire (non vegan) family adores my baking, and stopped asking me if it was vegan a long time ago.  I get mutters if I dont bring something to parties now, and almost everything I bring is made from this book.  The rugelach is especially good and so is the pumpkin bread.
B003JTHXOK|5|Well written and great pace. This book is by far one of my favorites and I would recommend it for anyone into the whole romance, action, and drama. SOOOO GOOD!!
B009TGXLZM|4|Cute Movie of one of my favorite authors.
0316666343|2|I was intrigued by the first half of the book.  The characters were likeable, but then it was like work to get through the rest.  It hit a low plateau and just continued the same.  I was so bored I never finished it.  It lingered too long on unecessary stuff- kind of like the movie \\"In The Bedroom\\" with Sissy Spacek and Marissa Tomei where there were long periods of nothing happening to propel the story forward. I thought it was a big snore after the first 3/4ths.
0345529057|5|This is an absolutely amazing series that I suggest everyone read. If you like the show, you will like the books so much more! Really really great. And they shipped well too! They were all in perfect condition.
031606792X|5|I was really surprised at so many negative reviews of this book (as well as sad to see so many spoilers...)    This 'baby-boomer' and young grandmother loved it! Yes, it was a bit different than the first 3 in format but once I finished it I couldn't wait to read it again.    Perhaps it's just that after seeing quite a bit of the realities of life for so many years, it's just nice to read a happy ending...    I highly recommend the entire Twilight series. I've read all 4 of them twice now and will probably start in on them again in a couple months. It's a great way to relax and leave the challenges of adulthood and the 'real world' behind for a while...
B001CDLAT4|3|While the cinematography is mind-blowing beautiful, the film has no plot that I can discern. It's not cohesive. The movie gathers several scenes, groups them under a quasi theme, then jumbles them all together. There's no flow. Also, some scenes are genuinely disturbing. I took off a star for the lack of flow and a second for the yuck factor.
B00180R06I|5|This is one of the most hauntingly beautiful films i have ever seen. The double exposure photography is absolutely genius. The whole film is stricking in every way. I adore this film.
B0094BB4TW|1|The update screwed everything up<br />Guess it's back to apple

B008ZOHCKE|5|I've been looking for a good notepad app for a while and this is the BEST I have ever found.  It does all the functions I need, it's clean, crisp, many useful services, such as converting my &quot;notebook&quot;  to a PDF, it has no bugs that I have seen, and best of all its FREE.  I highly recommend this app.
B00CNQ7HAU|5|Mr. Grisham  came through again.  I always loved his character developement and a very good story to tell.  I am so very glad I ordered this book.
B009AP2G26|2|Not my kind of show - the singing was good, but I'm really not interested in this type of comedy/entertainment

B004A8ZWSS|5|can enjoy more than once...I've seen  it 4 times....of couse I see every  Jolie and Depp oovie
0312370849|5|This is an extraordinary book. I don't want to say too much because if will give the book away. After reading this I thought there is no way someone made this up, I believe it really happened. Its too raw and pure to be fiction. Sarah never forgives herself and dies tragically, my guess is her heart never healed.

B00005JKT8|5|I just saw Kate &amp; Leopold, and it is funnier than I imagined, even funnier than &quot;French Kiss&quot;, which is another Meg Ryan film I like very much.  The scenes with Meg &amp; her younger brother (Breckin Meyer)are quite funny, and the scenes with Meg &amp; Hugh Jackman are funny as well.  This film is much better than I expected because of the romantic twists that were brilliantly interwoven with the underlying comedy.  So, I got to laugh quite a bit, and be moved to tears as well.  Meg Ryan's performance was brilliant because she knows how to support her fellow actors, helping make them shine.  I went away from this film with a good feeling--it was funny, uplifting and very satisfying.  Few films can do this, and I will see this film many more times, I'm sure!
B00CO4GO7I|5|Great book.  Very interesting & well written.  Read this before the movie came out.  Too bad he had to die by some crazy guy after all he had been through in the war.  What a loss.
0141439513|5|There aren't too many books that I absolutely never get tired of reading, but this is definitely one of them.  Fabulous characters and the perfect romance.  Even though it's become a bit cliche with all of the take-offs on the market right now, I will always love this book.
B007VUA7VO|4|I like this app for keeping track of my battery time as I have two children in my home that use my Kindle Fire quite a bit and tend to run the battery down without my knowledge...I really like that it can announce when the battery is fully charged or only is 50%, etc.
B00005ATQ8|4|its a bit long in spots.theres this guy barry lyndon who is somewhat of a prick.he does whatevers in his advantage at the moment to survive.he goes into the military a lot and ends up in a domestic situation.the kids will get bored.stanley kubrik directed so you know its a great great movie!there are a couple cool parts like these 2 duels.he gets in one where the rules are both aim and fire.the second one was i shoot then you load and shoot.i shoot then you load and shoot.thats dangerous buisness there.all the chicks are all proper and stay very very clothed the whole time.thats a bummer.barrys step son is very much obnoxious.kubrik means classic,dont forget that.
1590171993|4|Stoner is the story of an inconsequential man, the author tells us so right at the start, then proceeds to prove himself wrong.  Even the \\"smallest\\" existence can be so full of life, so full of meaning, Williams seems to be saying.  John Stoner grows up dirt poor but discovers a passion for literature and becomes a teacher at Columbia University.  The book chronicles university life and politics, love, marriage and parenthood and finally, the thoughts a man has as he prepares himself for departure from this world.  The book is very quiet and elegantly written.  It is also profoundly sad.  At every turn, Stoner is denied happiness, and yet he faces every situation with integrity and stoicism, like his farmer parents.  Life is endured, not enjoyed.  \\"...within a month he knew that his marriage was a failure; within a year he stopped hoping that it would improve. He learned silence and did not insist upon his love.\\"  For all it's sadness, the book is strangely compelling.  Williams' insights into the working of human relationships are timeless.  And his eloquent prose is an absolute pleasure to read and has a poignancy that I found deeply moving.  Rating: thoroughly readable
B00003CXSP|5|This was a great movie. Though lacking cannabalism,the movie was never boring and was surprising in nearly every scene. To call this movie bad is an insult to silence of the lams and the prequel manhunter.

B008XG1X18|4|I always find great ideas of things to cook,  buy,  and create on Pinterest! The way that it is organized makes it really easy to scroll through a lot quickly.
0060599847|2|I was disappointed with the CD because CD 6 was a repeat of CD 3. Not all the principles were in the CD set. I felt short changed.
B000002KHB|5|It is kind of disheartening to read about how Deep Purple are under-appreciated and less known than Black Sabbath or Led Zeppelin. I don't think this is true unless you are a 20-year old living in the States. In the rest of the world DP enjoys huge commercial success and enormous crowds of fans, clubs, cults and whatever... Let's get back to the album and we'll see that every (read my lips: every one of them!) track is at least very good.. and some are masterpieces like \\"Highway Star\\" or \\"Pictures of Home\\" or perennial favorite \\"Smoke on the Water\\" with that famous riff which is by now known to approximately 73 billion people... wait... what... oh! I meant 74 billion of course, then. Kidding aside, this is no Blue Oyster Cult for you buddy - this is hard and heavy and loud and oh goodness even with jams and big chunks of progressive artsiness through in for the good measure in \\"Lazy\\" and \\"Space Truckin'\\". I probably listened to this at least 15 times during first 3 months of my proud ownership of that precious piece of vinyl called LP. Go do the same right now! and when you get back check out other albums by Jon Lord and colleagues.
B00AQ3K8IU|5|5++ stars!! One of best books of 2012!<br /><br />Hopeless utterly blew me away. It was the kind of book that makes me want to stand on a rooftop and shout how amazing it is to the whole world! Beautiful, heart-wrenching and uplifting.<br /><br />Colleen Hoover's writing is absorbing, captivating, and flows so smoothly you barely feel the pages slipping by.<br /><br />After just reading the prologue, I. Was. Hooked.  and I just knew that I had to put my life on hold until I finished it. It gives you a taste of where the story is headed and just grabs at your heart in a way that makes you just NEED to know more.<br /><br />When Sky meets Holder, her life changes. He is the first guy to make her heart skip a beat. The first guy to really make her FEEL.<br /><br />\\"I've never been swept off my feet. I don't get butterflies. In fact the whole idea of being swooned by anyone is foreign to me... Somehow, in the course of sixty seconds, this guy has managed to swoon me, then terrify the hell out of me.\\"<br /><br />Dean Holder was absolutely amazing. With just a touch of bad boy, lickable dimples, a crooked smile and a tattoo, this moody, mysterious and endearing hot guy with a temper just utterly stole my heart.<br /><br />\\"I saw a guy at the store after school, and holy s***, Six. He was beautiful. Scary, but beautiful....as soon as I looked at him, it was like my entire body melted to the floor. He was... Wow.\\"<br /><br />Deeply protective and totally swoony but with a bad rep, he was so contradictory - warm, cold. Sweet, sharp. Just like Sky, I just NEEDED to know more about him. And the more I learned, the more the mystery deepened.<br /><br />I loved watching them get closer and closer. Their chemistry was undeniable and their dialogue and banter was rapid fire and brilliant and just set my heart a flutter.<br /><br />What they had was intense, passionate, and oh-so REAL. Every single thing they went though and did was believable and just made you wish you knew them in person.<br /><br />I loved that the story was serious but little parts made me laugh out, breaking up the more emotionally charged scenes. I swooned, squeed, proclaimed my undying love for the book, and had to take breathers to wipe the tears that sprung up on me more than once.<br /><br />I felt so in sync with Sky's emotions and journey. I felt like I went through all her emotions without ever once feeling disconnected. Through her eyes, I fell in love with Holder, I felt her pain and confusion, and I felt her healing. She was a wonderfully strong, brave heroine - the kind you want to look up to and make you feel proud of.<br /><br />This book has the. most. beautiful. intense. breathtaking. first kiss. EVER. (without actually kissing). Curious? You'll have to read it and see. But I am not kidding, it was one of the best written kisses I've ever read!<br /><br />I loved that the story was emotionally charged but with absolutely no stupidity. All the characters' reactions were understandable and just made me more and more sympathetic to them. This isn't to say that there wasn't angst and heart-clutching turmoil, because there was. The subject matter and themes are serious, gut wrenching and very mature. This book is definitely 17+.<br /><br />\\"Sometimes you have to choose between a bunch of wrong choices and no right ones. You just have to choose which wrong choice feels the least wrong.\\"<br /><br />I have to say that I didn't see the big reveal coming. I had my suspicions about one part of the story, but the other part totally took me by surprise.<br /><br />All the pieces of the story just build and build, layer upon layer of things you don't even realize are important until the secrets come out and the cascade of emotions from them just crash into you and take your breath away.<br /><br />\\"Life is real and sometimes it's ugly and you just have to learn how to cope.\\"<br /><br />This is a quite simply a beautiful story about love and survival. About hope and healing. About life and death. About coping with tragedy and finding forgiveness and peace. About being strong. About being a victim, but also a survivor.<br /><br />I honestly do not have one single complaint about this book. I have entire pages of my copy highlighted. Its THAT good.<br /><br />Every word, every sentence, every scene puts the imagery of the story into your head so vividly that you feel as though you are right there, watching the events unfold.<br /><br />This book NEEDS to be made into a movie!!<br /><br />This is one of those stories that will stay with you forever.<br /><br />And yes, there is a HEA :)<br /><br />\\"F**k all the firsts, Sky. The only thing that matters to me with you are the forevers.\\"I honestly do not have one single complaint about this book. I have entire pages of my copy highlighted. Its THAT good.

B00000IBRX|5|If you have an interest in fantasy, romance, imagination, originality,  emotion and the spiritual realm then you will love this movie! This is a  beautiful love story about two soulmates, Chris (Robin Williams) and Annie  (Annabella Sciorra).  Tragically, they lose both of their children in a car  accident. Soon afterwards, Chris dies in a car accident as well, leaving  Annie alone bereaved.  Chris comes back, in the Spirit, to try and comfort  his wife.  She can not see or hear him...or can she?<br />After much suffering  over her loss, Annie commits suicide.  Chris is happy when he is told in  his own private paradise.  But there is a problem.  Annie went to hell  because she &quot;violated the natural order of her journey.&quot;  Chris  responds to the terrible news with &quot;I'm her soulmate, I can find  her.&quot;  When told he does not understand he replies &quot;it is not  about understanding! It's about NOT giving up!&quot; Chris is determined to  find Annie no matter what the cost. &quot;What Dreams May Come&quot; is  beautiful from start to finish but Chris' search is what touched me the  most. This movie is about agape love--love so pure that it transcends  reason or consequence.  Follow Chris through a journey into the heart of  love.<br />This is Robin Williams in one of his best dramatic performances;  a must-have for any fan of his.  Annabella Sciorra is a wonderful actress  and she and Robin successfully portray soulmates.  The script is one of the  best I've ever heard, full of beautiful thought-provoking lines (such as  the title above.)  The cinematography and set design are absolutely  stunning--an astounding Heaven and Hell are depicted better than I've seen  in countless other movies. The soundtrack is deeply moving as well.<br />I  highly and whole-heartedly recommend this movie!
B009ZM7FWU|5|True, inspiring account of three youg girls as they trek 1200 miles across the unforgiving Australian outback to return to their mothers. Free young girls were forcibly separated from their mothers under the misguided policies of the Australian Government. Government policy were designed to breed Aborigines out of existence.  The young girls' success shows, once again, the indomitable human spirit can overcome the harshest obstacles.  Ironically, in later years, the heroine's own children are forcibly taken from her under the same government policies that continued until 1970.
0062103377|5|I haven;t finished this book yet, but it's great. I think Reed has captured Bobby Singer's voice really well, calling to Winchesters and others Hinter, and insulting the angels with terms from the show. There are hunts that we learn about that we haven't seen on the show, and there are many things listed that are in the show; salt, iron, angel blades and more. This is a great book for any fan of Supernatural.
B006M4RN3U|5|This album cheered me up<br />especially, the one of the track \\"Carry On\\" , it was so inspiring!!<br />I love Fun. and Nate's voice<br />This album was so special to me, such a storytelling from the Start to the end<br />Impressive!! As a result, i brought the Vinyl version too:)<br />everyone should go & buy it

B004A8ZWSS|3|For starters I am almost always willing to take a chance on anything, any film that the madcap actor (and my muse the late Hunter Thompson's friend) Johnny Depp puts his name to. With rare exceptions (the big one being his role as that self-same Hunter Thompson in the film adaptation of his book Fear and Loathing In Las Vegas) I have not been disappointed. And while I was not disappointed here the story line, and the antic -laden thriller did not do justice to his, or co-star Angela Joie's (she of the big lips in the title), talents.<br /><br />After all how hot and bothered is one to get over the whereabouts of a crackerjack thief, dough thief, big dough, billions and that is big dough even today, from a British gangster, and from the British tax boys looking for their graft, named Alexander Pearce anyway. And also constantly following a beautiful woman with big luscious red lips and a quaky English accent and who is filled to the brim, filled I tell you, with ennui looking to meet her man. And of course that gangster, that nasty gangster full of hubris and quirky habits. The problem though,  and this may have to do with the nature of star power and Hollywood's take on it, is how far into the movie will it take to figure out who that Mister Pearce really is. Guess?
B00JOT3HQ2|4|It it fun once you get the hang of it, (it takes a while) 😉.
0375707972|2|The beginning was beautifully written and sensitive.  After Hanna leaves, the story goes down such a different path that is so disconnected from the beginning which I call the first story.  While I appreciate the message  that the second part of the book was sending, it was like reading a book  written in two parts by two unequally talented authors.
B007JNWJMI|1|I believe we as collective users should and have to smash down the rating of any app with such intrusive unnecessary permissions. In order to that, I had to download the app and Uninstalled it, ONLY, to write this review.<br />Specially, when it's an App for MONEY. Oh, I got it for free FOATED<br />I believe it's not enough to skip an App with intrusive unnecessary permissions.  IT IS TIME for STRIKE BACK campaign. Maybe then producers will understand that we like the apps but our PRIVACY MATTERS. And our devices background running application is NOT their playground.
B005IQZB14|4|An interesting account of her adventure and the psychological forces driving her.  I sure could have done without the very graphic and brutal account of killing the horse.  If I had known it was coming, I would have skipped it. It upset me a lot and it's hard to get the pictures out of my mind. She is very good at description, but this was not needed and was horrific. I would actually have rather not read the book at all than be subjected to that brutal incident.
B0013V8OFI|5|One of my favorites growing up and I still love it today!!  Madonna at her best.  Great music as well!
B00ATPVA78|5|I like the story as it is different from most that are out there. It works great on my KD. The graphics are beautiful. The puzzles are fun. I haven't finished the game but am really enjoying it.
B004EPZ07K|4|I liked it, but I've also never read the comic books, so I don't know how accurate it is. I love the fact they show several different alien species. The graphics were great. It'll be interesting to see if they make a sequel and where they take it.

6304708491|3|If you're a Beatles fan and also if you aren't, you should buy Help! because it shows you once more how big were those four youngsters from Liverpool.<BR>If you've seen you, you might say something like &quot;since when these musicians became actors?&quot;, and you may right, but it still shouldn't change the fact that this movie is a good one, but different from A HARD DAY'S NIGHT, for example. If you haven't seen this one and already saw A HARD DAY'S NIGHT or THE FIRST U.S VISIT, you may be dissapointed after you'll see this one. However, I reccomend you to take this one. You may regret, but not for long.

B00005QDW5|5|&quot;Piper at the Gates of Dawn&quot;, &quot;The Wall&quot;, and &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; are just some of the albums with masterpiece songs and compositions included in this collection of Floyd's best.  A perfect balance of Gilmour's guitar, Water's lyrics, and Barret's mind - Echoes holds songs not just to be remembered by Floyd fans but to be remembered as some of the best music of all time.  Made with rememberance to all members of Pink Floyd (ex-ones and ones to date).
B0054JZC6E|1|well, this game started. out sounding cool. not so much. it was very boring. I dislike it. it wasvreally dumb.
0307887898|2|This is one of the few books I have bought via Amazon that I felt dirty that I had spent money on. Lots of waffle - the key points could have been summarised in 10 or 15 pages.  In one word - overrated. Eric seems to have written the right book at the right time, but ironically there is so much waste in the book!<br /><br />Save your money and read summaries about the book online at various websites. It's not worth the cover price.
B0001MLMKY|2|It was just too small. Their unisex size is really small. I have always loved swatch and will continue to wait until they release this style watch in a mens size
0439023491|5|The middle book of trilogies usually suffers from the injection of excessive background material (in order to eventually make the third book's conclusion plausible) or philosophical musings that wander around, as well as the introduction of more characters to add complexity to the overall tale. In the case of Catching Fire, this tale simply begins where Hunger Games left off and moves forward.<br /><br />Katnis continues to be the focus of an ill-defined, poorly organized rebellion of the Districts against the Capitol, but the threat doesn't seem real. The fact that the Capitol's president, Snow, is concerned is an important clue to the eventual climax, but that's for another book. Katnis also continues to be naively unaware of the politics surrounding these events which is refreshing. Although when the nature of the Quarter Quell games is revealed, it was disappointing that she couldn't divine the crude contrivance to \\"take her out.\\"<br /><br />Although, a storyline like this can fall into a rut, the Quarter Quell events were actually much more exciting to follow and quite intriguing in design. In addition, there is ample opportunity for dropping hints as to something more sinister and coordinated below the surface that is taking place, even if Katnis is either totally oblivious or misinterprets the signs.<br /><br />By the end, the reader is left with the question of how much more this Joan of Arc can be made to play Job for our enjoyment.
0375432302|5|Our book club read this book this past month.  It sparked a lot of conversation and we all found it very interesting.  You know a book is good when the majority of people reading it felt compelled to stay up really late every night reading until they finished it.  In other words, we could not put it down.  The codes were so interesting.  Highly recommend this one.
B008FRFN7A|5|I simply select the ePrint app on my Kindle, search for whatever I need from my documents, images, or online, and hit print.  Works beautifully!
B006LSZECO|3|Creepy but not really believable
B009O07NDY|4|Comparing to the images I've seen online of the Decca (European) release; this USA WaterTower records release is far superior.  Still not the faux-leather of the deluxe LotR soundtracks; but much more sturdy in hard card book style instead of flimsy card-sleeve wallet.<br /><br />Add to that the WaterTower android/iOS app and you can watch a trailer and a few featurettes on the making of the soundtrack without the bother of storing a DVD of 15mins that I'd probably only watch once anyway.<br /><br />Then, there's the 2CD score, with 8 additional minutes extended to some songs and a further 12 minutes or so in cues that weren't on the standard edition; adding up to approximately 20mins extra, and extended booklet and a better quality packaging experience - this version has it all.  (And a good Amazon.com price and goldbox deal to boot!)
044024238X|4|When I first picked up this book, my expectations were low. I wanted a quick, witty, predictable read, which wouldn't strain my brain, and allow me to indulge in a little down-time.<br />Well, The Undomestic Goddess proved to be both quick and witty, but definitely not predictable.<br />The plot is simple enough - 29 year-old Samantha has lost her job as a high-powered lawyer, due to a rather unfortunate mistake she has made in the office. And so to escape her past, Samantha disappears off into the country, to take up the role as housekeeper for an affluent English couple. The only problem is that Samantha has claimed to be a cordon bleu chef, when if fact, she knows absolutely nothing about cooking or housekeeping. Mayhem ensues as Samatha tries to work out how to prepare more than just toast, while trying to hide her previous identity as a lawyer.<br />The Undomestic Goddess could have been a predictable fairy-tale read for adults, but somehow, Sophie Kinsella has managed to make this story plausible, by adding some fascinating little twists to the plot. Kinsella has also created an endearing character in Samantha, who is struggling, like every other woman, to balance her priorities in life.<br /><br />The Undomestic Goddess is a great summer read that is fun, clever and highly entertaining.<br /><br />Zara Stevens<br />[[ASIN:141967787X Boy Meets Girl: A Pocketful of Wedding Stories]]
B00BATG18K|5|The best book I ever read.
0399143904|5|This is one of the best Clancy books I have ever read.  To the reader from  Bayville, NJ, you said never has so little been conveyed in so many pages.   You call a terrorist bank robbery, killing  a terminally ill kid, taking  hostage an Austrian,  and taking hostage thirty-three kids little.  You are  just blind.
B005HSL626|4|Freezes up a lot even after uninstalling and shutting several times.  Game is so much fun when it is working right that I put up with the freezing issue
B004LROUNG|4|Gritty and classic Grisham story line- may be a little too classic. I felt like I was reading The Firm plot with a few differences. A decent read but nothing new.
0763644765|5|Bought this for my grandson when he started potty training. It's a great book.
B00DR0PDNE|5|This will chance your life and for only $35 who doesn't want game changer tech in their house.
B000SVZIGC|5|This was one of my favorite movies growing up! It has a really good plot line and fun songs. It's about a girl who gets separated from her family for ~10 years and doesn't remember who she is and about her finding herself. It is a little dark and scary at some parts so if your kids are super sensitive to that sort of thing then maybe this isn't a movie for you.
B0054R6BFM|5|Suicide is one of those topics that parents typically shy away from talking about - no one wants to even acknowledge that it could happen. And when it does, there's usually someone saying, &#34;her life wasn't that bad, I don't know why she did this.&#34; This book helps to answer that question.<br /><br />From personal experience, I can tell you that the reasons that some kids give for trying to kill themselves sound silly to an adult's ears. They sound inconsequential, worth only a moment's thought. Even to other kids, these events just seem like a brief occurrence in an otherwise uneventful day. To the kid living through it, however, it is a link in a long chain of events that together form a reason - take any one of them out of context, and they are insubstantial, but when seen together, they form the noose.<br /><br />I have seen teachers and other parents who dismiss young tween despair as an attempt for attention or being &#34;overly dramatic&#34; and they react badly to these kids. Those teachers need to read this book. Guidance counselors, parents, pastors, etc. all need to read this book.<br /><br />Should kids read this book? I thought long and hard before letting my daughter read it. I was afraid at first that she would see what the main character had done as a valid solution instead of the wrong solution. We are meant to regret the decision she made, not support it. In the end, I did let her read it, but we used it to talk about the different ways that things could have gone differently, and how terrible it was for the people left behind. I think she took comfort in knowing that other people understood how little slights and injuries add up over time, demoralizing the person and exhausting the mind.<br /><br />Recommended for parents of tweens and teens, and anyone who works with them. I would say middle-school and up, due to some violence and sexual situations, but nothing that your middle schooler hasn't seen on tv or on the news already (or, more likely, heard from his/her friends).<br /><br />Great book!ely, heard from his/her friends).<br /><br />Great book!
B001ECDVKE|5|Comedy
B00009XITQ|5|Being a huge fan of Amanda Bynes (I'll admit that I loved The Amanda Show and All That), I knew I had to check out WHAT A GIRL WANTS. I had heard it being compared to The Princess Diaries, which isn't all that far off. It's another cute, girl power movie. <br /> <br />Daphne Reynolds (Amanda Bynes) loves living in her apartment in Chinatown with her mom, but she really wants to know who her dad is. Her mom never really tells her, and Daphne still really, really wants to know him. What she does know, though, is that he lives in England. On her birthday, she uses her money to buy a plane ticket to London and plans to meet her dad. When she first arrives, Daphne is a bit overwhelmed.  <br /> <br />She meets a few friends along the way (Ian Wallace, the musician, is probably the most memorable), and they all tell her that she has to try to make peace with the fact that her dad is getting remarried to a completely horrible woman with an equally bad daughter. Of course, the movie wouldn't be complete without a few of Amanda's token pratfalls, but for once they're actually pretty funny. <br /> <br />WHAT A GIRL WANTS is definately a cute movie, and it has a killer soundtrack. Highly recommended if you liked The Princess Diaries (one and two), A Walk to Remember, or How to Deal. <br /> <br />Overall grade - A+

B0054W4JQK|4|Great read! Bta than the movie
B00BESM14U|4|The movie brings attention to several issues commonly faced by teens as well as the mental illness suffered by one of the main characters.  Ezra Miller as Patrick was great.  The other characters were really good as well.  Ezra's character really stood out in the movie.  I first saw Ezra Miller when he played Tucker on Royal Pains.  Tucker and Libby were great characters.  Wish they were still on the show.
B000002C4J|5|No one, NO ONE, can deny that Celine Dion has the best voice of anyone out there right now. Anyone who cannot see that is just jealous that they cannot even sing a note. Just because she is getting all the attention she  deserves, you all think you can just bash her. Well, this is one of the  best, if not best CD I own. My favorite songs are &quot;Us,&quot; &quot;My  heart will go on,&quot; &quot;The Reason,&quot; and  her best song yet,  &quot;To love you more.&quot; I watched her sing &quot;to love you  more,&quot; live a few times, and oh, there is so much feeling in it and  her voice just completly captavates you. She's amazing. And no one can even  compare her to Mariah Carey who just sells her body to get albums done. Her  voice is so whinny. Celine can truly sing without over doing it be those  stupid &quot;screaming girl&quot; type of voices. If you buy any of  Celine's albums, this has got to be it!
B004SJ3BCI|5|My son downloaded this game for me to try.  It was my first Angry Birds experience and I love it!!
B008AIGWVA|1|Unlike the other talking games I've downloaded, my antivirus app stopped me and told me that this app had a virus. A pretty bad one at that. I think it was the kind that downloads other things. Let me remind you, that this is the ONLY one out of all the Talking Friends apps that the app stopped me after or before downloading it! Not even Talking Angela made my app stop me from downloading it.
B000U5W2XI|4|Very Nice picture disc not listening the songs but it's always original and classic .
B006MW3UZW|5|I had heard that Downton Abbey was really very good, but must disagree. It is superb!  I just finished the  second season, and  am frustrated that I cannot go on to the third until it is available.<br /><br /> The period costumes are beautiful and it feels as if you are right there, in Downton, either with the family who lives there or below stairs with the servants.<br /><br />The plots are complex and  entertaining, and all the characters are believable and very human; some are laudable, some most definitely are not.<br /><br />I recommend it wholeheartedly.<br />This is entertainment at its best.  I fully recommend it.
B007BFSYMS|1|I was really looking forward to using this app. However, I found that I can't download sounds w/o either a Google+ or Facebook account.  I have neither and do not plan on getting them.
B005ZOBNOI|4|I decided to read this when two of my Goodreads friends highly recommended it. I read it quickly and this is what I know:  Grief is palpable!  I have had it in my life and I know I am surely to experience it again.  This book evoked such strong emotion that it hurt and reminded me of how grief feels. The author does a good job in making you invested in these characters.  Yes, these teenagers were wise beyond their years, but their battle with cancer sped up their understanding of life. It was also poignant and real for me because I used to live in Indianapolis for many years and could picture the geographic references.
B000FCKC4C|5|Simple to read but deep in meaning. It was thought provoking and spoke to my heart. I will be thinking about this book for years to come.
B001HNE3NO|5|I absolutely fell in love with reading this book! I am so fascinated about learning from our past and history! I watched the movie that came out after I read this book! It's a tear jerker for sure but I would recommend it to anyone who wants to learn about the holocaust!
B00JVZ0DQG|5|Having a great time playing the game.

B009IJJ5B4|5|Far and away my favorite show, Elementary is far better than the average TV fare.  Clever, funny, thoughtful, smart.  The basic premise is a modern NYC-based take on the Arthur Canon Doyle formula.  The interplay between Sherlock Holmes (Jonny Miller) and Dr. Joan Watson (Lucy Liu) crackles with intelligence.  The characters, each with complex backstories and secrets, are far more than your standard detective stereotypes.  The writing is marvelous.  The plots are varied and clever serving as stage to the evolving relationship between Holmes and Watson. I like and care for the characters.  Every episode is a treat, to be relished.  A tremendous success, thankfully renewed for a second season.
B00IRMTTPU|5|I realize that not everyone will be affected by this movie the way that I was.  If you have any kind of closeness to this subject matter, you will appreciate this movie.
159448385X|5|This was the first book I've read from his collection and once I started I could not stop until I was through with the book! I've read all his books (in the process currently with mountains echoed) and you will surely not be disappointed with his skill of writing!<br />Highly recommend his books and I will continue purchasing his future works!
B00K0OI42W|5|The best book ever written.  I have read it at least 30 times in my life and have watched the movie many times as well.  Truely a classic.
B001EBV0OY|5|As one of my favorites since the first time I had ever seen it, drawing me in with its two introductions and plot development from the first five minutes. Every time the film was on television, watching it gave me something different every time. There was a new fact or scene giving another feel or theme within the plot. The Shawshank Redemption starts with two introductions, presenting both of our main characters, Andy Dufresne and Ellis \\"Red\\" Redding. Andy is a banker, falsely accused of killing his wife and her lover, while Red's background was never revealed. But even from the first few minutes of the movie, with these introductions, two main themes repeatedly jumped out from the story. Of the many characteristics of a film, themes are only a fraction of what makes this film fantastic, but with the two simple themes of hope and freedom.<br /><br />The first symbol of freedom displayed in the film is a negative theme. Right off of the opening credits, it could not be ignored. Within the first introduction, Andy's freedom was taken away from him by false accusation. Secondly, Red's introduction revealed him getting rejected by the Parole Board after twenty years in Shawshank Prison. Both scenes reject their freedom, but from there, it keeps building positively. Of the many examples within the movie, there is one that sticks out the most. When Andy finally does get out of prison, it's during a thunder storm. He stands up, raises his arms and his head to the sky; no words are spoken, and nothing but Andy's laughter, the rain, and thunder is heard in the scene. Just with this image, the theme of freedom produced is almost tangible. Thinking about getting out of jail after 19 years is unimaginable until the final feeling of freedom is revealed.<br /><br />The second theme is hope. This also begins negatively when both introductions produce negative hope. It picks up much more quickly though. Another main character within the story is a man named Brooks. He is older andhas been in jail for fifty years when his parole was granted. But Brooks has a hard time on the outside. He writes a letter to his friends in the jail (consisting of Andy, Red, and a few others). \\"I don't like it here. I'm tired of being afraid all the time. I've decided not to stay...\\" (he hung himself). This theme of useless hope re-emerges when Andy mentions his dream life. Red tries to shut it down, but Andy remains stubborn toward his fantasy. This theme continues a while later when Andy is gone and Red's parole is accepted. He is released (another example of freedom), but then experiences the same feelings Brooks does. Although Andy made Red promise to perform a task, Red doesn't see the point. Hope finishes out our movie when Red keeps his promise. The movie ends with Red finding a letter from Andy. \\"I hope I can make it across the border. I hope I can see my friend and shake his hand. I hope the pacific is as blue as it is in my dreams. I hope...\\"<br /><br />The Shawshank Redemption offers so many more examples for hope and freedom than the ones used here. With these two simple themes repeated countless times in different settings, this movie keeps its audience thinking. There is always a new idea, theme, example, concept, or characteristic able to pick out every time the film is shown. I've seen it countless times and the two simple themes continue to stand out and support each other through new-found evidence. A recommendation to all, a drama never to be forgotten, and a movie that will enthrall new--and audiences for years to come, The Shawshank Redemption leaves a warm feeling of satisfied resolution.
B00D7Z4GQY|5|I could not put this book down! (and I don't normally read this type of novel) The plot kept you guessing long enough to keep you interested, but not too long so you started to think &#34;who cares?&#34; and the ending was so unexpected.
B00I8Q77Y0|3|The game is Flappy bird but say what you want this game is good but graphics aren't very good they need to step up other wise it's a good game I give it a 4 because of that reason
B008Y2FRFO|3|The game is exciting to play.but it's challenging .but it's also like u have to win these coins and its difficult because u need. The coin walls.
B009ZQC7MY|5|I am thoroughly enjoying this series. Thank you Amazon Prime!!
B00915G6MG|5|Love NCIS
B00V4JJFN4|5|awesome
B00B2GK4KW|5|Very much enjoy using the Martha Stewart circle edge paper punch, find the minimum size circle of 6 inch, a little restrictive, if you need to make a small card, but it is very effective and gives card instant impact. Would recommend.
B00I8Q77Y0|5|This app is super super super super super cool! Very similar to Flappy Bird! My whole family loves this app as well!!

6305696071|5|I don't know of anyone who hasn't seen this movie and I know very few who didn't like it (those few were men).  This is a classic Cinderella tale gone awry with beautiful Cinderella being played by a hooker.  Julia Roberts pulls off both aspects wonderfully.  Richard Gere is a great choice for a costar as he really fits the bill of a suave businessman.  The premise is pure, but the plot is seedy.  Julia is a prostitute with big aspirations squelched somehow by society, seemingly leaving her only this foul choice to make a living.  Gere is a filthy rich businessman who is out of town and needs a date for a dinner party.  Oddly, he thinks a hooker is the logical choice.  Yet, it works.  Julia fumbles through the etiquette of a world unfamiliar which lends the humor to this romantic comedy.  The chemistry between Roberts and Gere provides the romance that made this movie so very famous.  A star the size of Julia Roberts is not born of a bad movie.  This is a must-have.
B00GDT5T9Y|5|All time favorite kid movie and I have watched it over and over. I never tire of watching it. Upbeat and funny too!
B00BAXFECK|5|It's not a masterpiece or anything, but it's a great read.  It's easy to get through and really enjoyable.  I was really invested in the characters.  This book was recommended to me, which usually means I'm going to be disappointed, but it met my raised expectations, and I found it to be a perfect diversion to curl up with while the winter snow fell outside.  Good read.
B005Z271Y6|5|Adele is so wonderful and beautiful and talented and...I could go on and on.  This blu-ray DVD brings her soul and passion and humor into your living room with such clarity and perfection - I'm definitely a big fan of Blu-Ray now, but I digress.  Adele is so very funny.  She'll have you laughing one moment and crying the next.  Her emotion is so raw and she just puts it all out there on the table.  There's nothing fake about her and she deserves all the success that has come her way and I know that things will just continue to be awesome for her!  When my wife first heard her song \\"Chasing Pavements\\" she said to me, \\"Wow, she's gonna be a huge success, just watch.\\"  I was a bit skeptical but she was absolutely correct in her prediction.  I really hope she tours the U.S. soon.  To see her LIVE in person would no doubt be the most awesome experience - next to seeing Wicked (which we've seen twice).  :-)  If you are having any doubts at all about purchasing this DVD - rest assured, you will NOT be disappointed.  I was sad when it was over.

B00VFTD43A|5|Cumberbatch is terrific, the rest of the cast is superb, and the screenplay is excellent.  It's hard to see how it could be any better.  The best movie I've seen in a long time.
B006C3Q6GG|4|Enjoyed the instruction in old timey sailing ships. Historical novels are the best. Characters not so well defined, had trouble keeping track of some.
B005EGXTHG|4|After seeing the movie \\"Hunger Games\\" was interested to read the next book in the trilogy.<br /><br />I was very impressed and I am egar to read the final book of the three in the Hunger games books.<br />I was not disappointed and would recommend this book, exciting reading, keeps you wanting to read<br />just one more page!!!
B00AREIAI8|4|It's a nice game could use some updates but it's great for horse crazy people like me 😜
B00005JMJG|5|I wasn't sure what to think the first time I saw Being John Malkovich, I didn't dislike it but I didn't like it either. It certainly kept me interested throughout as a concept, very very bizarre.  I read Susan Orlean's The Orchid thief and was interested to see Adaptation which was equally bizarre but easier to get into.  I didn't know what to think about Eternal Sunshine when I saw the previews but I knew I had to see it, and to this point in 2004 it is bar none my favorite movie.  The plot line is intense and interesting througout never allowing you to feel comfortable until the credits start to roll.  Extremely well acted and layed out, the cinematography is first rate.  Characterization in this film is different from his other works because the majority of moviegoers can relate to the feelings and predicament Jim Carrey's character ends up in.
0767819543|5|This is one of the best movies of all time.  Fernanda Montenegro is incredible in this film.  Don't miss this one!
B0086700CM|5|this app is amazing!! its absolutely perfect!  nothing has ever been a problem. temple run shouldn't be changed at all.
B00E8KLWB4|1|I didn't care for this game at all. Maybe it is because I was playing on a Kindle fire. The clues as to what you're looking for aren't very clear.
B00ADR2DTG|5|Got this little guy for Xmas and oh am I glad Santa dropped it off. WoW!!  I can't imagine the sound getting better, but I am sill burning it in. Fire up some Pink Floyd and sit back and be ready for your mind to be blown.  It is amazing.  It is driving my Audio-Technical ATH-M50x without issue!
B00B5FBQTS|4|Not really my forte for tower defense game. It's not bad but I don't like the limited amount of &#34;towers&#34; you use. however having your characters move around and reposition for various incoming wave directions is a nice twist. It doesn't quite do it for like Monkeys TD5 or Monkey Village, but it could be a way to take a break from the monkey tower defenses.,
B00ESNE696|5|Lots of twists and turns. A little emotional, but very well written and acted.
1594633665|5|Wonderful! Everyone should read it!
B0000AQS0F|5|Fantastic stuff!  If you don't like it you just don't like being entertained!  Joss Weadon is an undeniable talent with a real knack for blending drama and humor.  Browncoats will persevere... &#34;Burn the land and boil the sea, you can't take the sky from me.&#34;  Thanks Joss!
B004H4XI5O|3|1. This book is about two things: anecdotes of the author while learning to improve his memory, and a general introduction about the kind of people who use these methods to participate in memory contests, and other small details.<br /><br />2. This book is not: a detailed description or an user's guide of how to use the memory tricks mentioned in the book.<br /><br />3. It is well written, he is a very good journalist. It resembles more a novel than a text book. I devoured the book (if he writes a novel, I will be the first one to read it). But it did not fulfilled my expectations. I should have read before the negative reviews here, because they are true.<br /><br />4. The Kindle version (as with other books) is poor. I would like to have more active links to footnotes while I am reading.<br /><br />5. Conclusion:<br />  a) If you want to read five books about this kind of techniques (or if you just want to read it as a light novel), this can be the first one and you will be delighted.<br />  b) If you really want to memorize an entire encyclopedia and learn how to do it just by reading one book, don't read this one. In another review there is a list of other books, which I haven't read.<br />  c) Before I read Kevin Vost's book, which is good and more practical, but not very deep (I know he is preparing a second one).<br /><br />----<br />{once you read the book, you will find the title interesting, otherwise it doesn't make sense}
B00Q7WBFTA|4|Theatrical film review.  Just like the Tony award winning Broadway production, the movie version is messy, with plotlines, unlikely coincidences and other head scratchers.  But I didn't go to this movie for a reality check.  I came for Stephen Sondheim's music and lyrics.  Director Rob Marshall is no stranger to musicals and here he sticks with the basics that appeared on Broadway.  Sure the sets are more elaborate as are the special effects.  But this movie won't be confused with a big blockbuster in spite of its $50 million budget.  I suspect much of that went to the cast.  And it's a good one.<br /><br />In this mishmash of fairy tales, James Corden and Emily Blunt star as The Baker and The Baker's wife.  Unable to have children thanks to a spell placed on them by their neighbor, The Witch (a splendid Meryl Streep).  The Witch is under a spell of her own which took away here beauty.  Cinderella is played by Anna Kendrick.  She's wanting to go to the ball which here lasts for 3 nights.  With the help of her singing birds she does and meets the handsome prince (Chris Pine).  Other characters include Jack (as in \\"the beanstalk\\") played by Daniel Huttlestone, Little Red Riding Hood (Lilla Crawford), The Wolf (Johnny Depp), Repunzel (Mackenzie Mauzy), her prince (Billy Magnussen), Jack's mum (Tracey Ullman) and Cindy's mean stepmother (Christine Baranski).<br /><br />Essentially the story centers around The Witch agreeing to lift the no-baby spell if the couple will collect 4 essential items that she needs to lift her own spell.  They are a white cow, red cloak, corn-yellow hair and gold slippers.  So now you get it, right?  What has always given me cause for a chuckle in this story, are some of the below the radar adult themes.  Starting with The Wolf's eyeballing Red and perhaps not just because she would be good to eat.  And then there is the probable adultery between The Baker's Wife and Cindy's prince.  It's nothing overt so kiddies and some adults won't even notice.<br /><br />As far as the music, everyone does a terrific job with their songs, and there are many to spread around.  I'm never surprised anymore by how well actors can hold a tune.  While I'm sure there are technical enhancements needed now and again, the actor/singer's do the music proud.  And that's what I came for.s the music, everyone does a terrific job with their songs, and there are many to spread around.  I'm never surprised anymore by how well actors can hold a tune.

B00CWY76CC|4|It is a great game to pass the time
B00L9B7IKE|5|Read this in one weekend. A similar read to Gone Girl.....exciting, fun book that is interesting and keeps you guessing until the end.
B00AEV60GS|4|If You Need to see what your channel is or what is available this is a good app. It did however take up a lot of memory and I had to clean up to play other games or even read a book on my kindle fire.

B004DLPXAO|5|Kindle, its always good. Have now connected with 2 Ipads, 1 Iphone (retired), 1 Samsung Tab 7, 1 Samsung S2.
0792839676|1|It was such a long time since I saw this movie. I was a younger teen back then. I thought the movie was ok. I really wasn't sure about the story line. All I know is Carrie got some power to move things with her mind when she was a senior in high school not giving enough information as how she come to get them and the house being swallowed by the ground. There just wasn't enough story to the story. I was very disappointed. It's not worth buying.....
B00DUGCLY4|5|This game is easy at first then gets harder. Luv it!
B007CKNX28|4|This is, without a doubt, a Jack White album. It also sounds nothing like any other Jack White album.  Most of the songs are more likely to be driven by piano than guitar. There is very little of the blues work that made him so famous. On first listen, I was kind of confused. Blunderbuss is a very difficult album to describe. One musical passage brought a Miles Davis \\"Kind of Blue\\" vibe into my head. And it wasn't jazzy sounding, but the interplay of the different instruments fitting together that made my brain make that connection. But I listened to it a few more times and really found the songs growing on me. Even when toned down, in comparison to some other releases, this music is still played with FEELING, something Jack obviously posseses in spades. Screaming guitars aren't all over this record, but when used they still sound badass as usual. This is an album that needs to be listened to, several times preferably in headphones to really enjoy. Just give it a fair shake...
B00B7NPRY8|5|What is unique about Herbert is his ability to weave not just a good story, but an entire multi-world government with its own levels of social and intellectual strata.  Herbert asks what the world would be like in a thousand years or so, then fast forwards far past that.  This first novel asks the question, \\"What would happen if a leader were chosen for all the right reasons?\\"  Galactic peace?  Hardly.  His attention to detail and his characters' ability to observe the slightest minutiae in others adds verisimilitude to an almost unbelievable universe, and certainly keeps the pages turning.
B003F3FJQO|5|I've been hooked since the first book and this one didn't disappoint! I'm really enjoying the revelations of Thomas as he tries to sort out his memories and the plot twist keep coming. I'm ready for the final book and get answers. Who is wicked and what is going on?
B009GXHOW4|4|I saw the paid version of this and didn't want to buy anything. My friend showed me the free version and I was both disappointed and amazed<br /><br />Good:<br /><br />* If you have an invaluable item like dirt or wood, you can easily turn it into 5 stacks . of diamond<br />*You can see how many mobs of which kind are in your world. Very useful for mob hunting<br />*Can change location (x,y,z)<br />*You can change the gamemode and time of day<br />*Super easy to use for pocket edition. It connects automatically without any logins, internet, or crashing.<br /><br />Bad<br /><br />*When I downloaded it the first time, I got a error message that said , Unable to install, app has been corrupted. Wtf??<br />*Cant spawn any mobs. It should allow us to spawn at least chickens or zombies.<br /><br />Altogether, its a pretty cool app. I reccomend it to those who cant find a single diamond even if they stay up late trying.<br /><br />My hopes for the future are that they would add texture packs and skins. Its a great app though. no regrets installing it!!!
B005HEF8OC|5|The show is a great explanation of the start of the journey of the ship known as Enterprise.  The acting is entertaining and the storylines show the growth of the crew.
B00P42WROG|4|Loved this book. I am really enjoying this different path Mr. King is taking.  Very much looking forward to the final book in the trilogy
B0058VW36U|4|There are lot of reviews out there but for me (not regular gamer) this game gave unique challenge to kids and adults. I have used very limited games from many bought over period and this is one of it.
B007IXWKUK|5|This sequel has so much in it you wouldn't even believe. A lot more stuff has happened and so much more to come. Keep reading!

B00BUCXVPI|4|I like this movie. Surprisingly it is a good movie from Tom Cruise. Lately he has been doing a bunch of crappy movies.
B009NQZVKG|1|Not very enjoyable & I gave up after 100 pages or so.  The plot became so unrealistic to be unbelievable.
B008OE05IG|5|fantastic documentary.  i hope to one day be able to go and try
B00KNOVIAE|4|I really enjoyed this movie. However it kept buffering and changing from HD to SD. How annoying!
B007URVZJ6|5|This is very useful and easy to understand. I tried it out with OpenOffice and still managed to finish making a book with the step-by-step instruction.
B00AG6Z92C|5|I received my CD well before expected date.  I listened to all the songs this morning.  This man has an incredible voice, loved all the songs.  Two of the songs actually brought me to tears, Anema E Core and La Vie En Rose, they were so special.  I did not understand a word he sang, except, I think it was two of them in English.  I purchased for Perfidia and loved them all.

B00FRCNNVY|5|Anoushka Shankar has a marvelous talent nurtured by her father's tutelage yet evolved in a way truly her own. This album is experimental in the way Breathing Under Water is (incorporating Western instruments and melodies with traditional ragas) yet far more unified in tone and theme. Half-sister Norah Jones (a very talented artist in her own right) makes several welcome appearances on this album. Her rich and at times smoky voice pairs beautifully with the sitar and accompanying instruments.<br /><br />This is definitely an album that only improves upon repeated listening.
B005DQ3B7K|5|OMG!! this is what I have been looking for forever and well I cannot get enough of this CD, the Art of Noise is by far one of the most unique sounding groups ever and I say I used to breakdance to this music especially &#34;BEATBOX&#34; the best!! you gotta get this CD all you young Breakers this is the CD you need to own, or anyone who enjoys &#34;Old Skool&#34;  music,
0425263916|2|It's hard to believe that  this author could write a book so much like 50 Shades and not have  E. L. James slap a libel suit on her.  Characters, setting, etc. are all so similar but not as developed and detailed as 50 shades trilogy
0790729628|4|The DVD version of this film is definitely worth seeing; details and images which were not discernable in the videotape version are clear as a bell here. The sound is also very clear and projects well, even on a purely stereo system. My only caveat is that the original version has not been made available; I may be swimming upstream on this one, but I enjoy the narration. First, the fact that it's a bit corny just places the film squarely in the film noire tradition, where the private detective hero frequently provides a cliche-laden voiceover. Second, it adds to our understanding of the character. Ridley Scott's contention at the time the director's cut was released that the voiceover didn't add anything to the film is simply not true and must be attributed to pre-release hype; without the voiceover, for example, we wouldn't know that Deckerd had a failed marriage in his past caused by his emotional coldness (he was as cold as sushi), which adds to our understanding of the emotional toll caused from his job as a Bladerunner. However, the director's cut does restore the original, haunting ending and provides a useful service by deleting the tacked-on and awkward sunny ending added to the film originally. All in all, a great release and a classic film.
B00JTRY5R4|5|Nice game.  This is, for me, a return to the RPGs I spent many an hour with growing up.  So far the story is good, and I've actually been wrong about a character or two, which doesn't happen often after playing RPGs for so long.  Plus, it's got me wondering, &amp;#34;Is she really who they think she is?&amp;#34;
6305657947|4|Normally, when a movie is redone 30 years later, the end result is worse than the original.  Not so in this case, as John McTiernan's version is highly superior.  This movie brings the elegance that was missing from the original.  The music is fantastic, and the aesthetic is that much better.  Also, instead of bank robbery, the film revolves around a much more elegant crime; the theft of a Monet worth 100 million dollars. <br />Thomas Crown(Pierce Brosnan) is the fabulously wealthy owner of Crown Acquistions.  Supposedly, as his life is quite boring, he decides to steal a painting-not for the money, but for the thrill.  He sends some Eastern Europeans to attempt to steal 200 pounds of paintings, while sending them to fail and sneaking away to steal a painting from another area.  Catherine Banning(Rene Russo), an insurance &quot;bounty hunter,&quot; comes from England to help the detective(Denis Leary) crack the case.  While Banning is investigating Crown, they fall more and more in love, leading to a very interesting competitor/lover relationship.<br />Pierce Brosnan plays Thomas Crown excellently.  He brings elegance and class to the role that Steve McQueen could not.  Rene Russo holds up as Catherine Banning.  Denis Leary, though funny as always, just should not be in this film.  He is somewhat of a comic relief character.  Along with the shameless product placement of Pepsi One, that is what keeps it from getting 5 stars.  However, the acting of Brosnan along with the fantastic score and unbelievably cool ending make this movie great fun. In regard to special features, they are lacking, but the movie is all too worth buying.
B0050DZN4K|1|love this app on my phone but it is not working on my new Nook Tablet, seems like the same problem for the new K Fire.
B00KW1TGDE|2|Bought the package of 5 bulbs in March, using an average of 3-4 hours per day and 2 of the bulbs stop working in July. Product specs says lifespan is 30,000 hrs. however my experience and also from other customers reveals that some of the bulbs do not last for more than 3 months. Also, there is no available warranty information, that as everyone else suffering from the same problem need to acquire new bulbs.
B003L7861E|5|I highly recommend this book to those who enjoy reading about people that choose the life of food preparation. The food descriptions made me salivate. The characters were interesting and the story well told.  It's not great literature but it is a great story.
B00571F26Y|5|I bought this book because my daughter needs a gluten free diet. But then I began to see some things that applied to me, too. So I started avoiding wheat and wheat products myself. Without actually &#34;dieting&#34;, I began to lose weight. Nothing else had ever worked for me. Now I have lost 60 lbs and several dress sizes. My diabetes meds and high blood pressure meds have been cut in half. I want to shout it from the rooftops. Buy it, read it, try it.
B00KA87GCW|5|Only been playing for a little bit but really like it.
B002PEP4SC|4|Very similar to Castle's prime time series on television.  Captures  the characters and their attitudes and personalities for the mystery series.
B000TCEU4Q|5|Great Product fast shipping... Thanks Again
B009VSW15Y|3|Don't really care for the quality of the appearance of the pictures. and its not rear facing so hard to take pictures
B00138KISM|5|Yes, it's a bit over-produced.  It was the late 80s so that is understandable.  Once you get past the obligatory pop/rock single material, there are some great deep tracks here.
B00BAXFECK|5|Every page of this book was a joy to read, although heartbreaking at times. While several things are left unresolved, it was a satisfying ending filled with the right questions... because the thing about life is that there really are no answers -- it just is what it is.
B005GFPZYK|1|It was boring. He describes each kill as though he shot a can off a fence. I'm  sure the fiml is graphic, but the book was a yawn. total disappointment.
0316077046|5|this such a good book I collect all of the Beautiful Chaos (Beautiful Creatures) thanks for being on top of everything and sending the books before time
B00NQKW94G|5|A fitting obituary.....<br /><br />This album has many of the things that those of us who grew up listening to Floyd came to love about the band (Except, of course the lyrics that the band did as well or better than anyone of the era), music that literally soars and dives; and granted, there will be naysayers who suggest this has some amazing tracks that should have had lyrics and been included on Division Bell. But if like myself, you think of this creation as the \\"Final Cut\\" as it were, the last notes echoing from the last album of it's kind from what may be the greatest band of it's kind of all times.....it kind of makes sense. IF Pulse is the metaphoric opening of what the band is and does; this works as the final cut.<br /><br />I guess in the end, the music will always be louder than words. Amen.<br /><br />It's not for everyone. It is for every true hard core fan of the band who may be on their 3rd or 4th different format of DSOTM.
B005KJJ4F8|5|Great plot with good character development.  Easy and fun reading.
B004SRWW0C|5|Good Product!
B00LZWV8JO|5|Not as involved as The Baroque Cycle yet way more depth than Reamde, anyone who likes Stephenson will really enjoy this book.  And for those who don't know him, be prepared for excellent writing, a breadth of vision and hardcore intelligence in action.
6304025831|5|<br /> Another Scorsese/Deniro blockbuster.Many actors from the \\"Goodfellas' fame make this film a bloody, sickly humorous and edge of your seat crime drama. If you have \\"Goodfellas\\", you MUST get this as well.
B0052WSX32|5|You often hear sports announcers speculate on whether Babe Ruth could hit modern pitching or whether or not Ben Hogan would be challenging Tiger Woods today if he were the same age and using the same equipment.  Similarly, when hearing singers from Doris Day's era sound so graceful and appropriate in delivering the music from their time, I've often wondered what those same singers would sound like if they were to record newer songs with more contemporary arrangements and instrumentation.  It turns out that a great singer is a great singer, and Doris Day can make any song her own with her unique ability to caress a lyric.  Ms. Day was in her early 60's when she recorded most of these songs in the mid-1980's, and these sessions found her in fine voice.  The sound quality of the tracks is excellent.  Hearing these recordings for the first time in 2011 is quite a treat.  Her spoken intro to the penultimate track, which is sung by her son, Terry Melcher, sounds to have been recently recorded.  All in all, my assessment of Doris Day's \\"My Heart\\" is that it is a moving, finely crafted album that is also a breath of fresh air from the past.

B0089EHWQE|5|Started out slow but the story really picked up. Everyone  in our book club liked it too. Did not expect the ending!!
0439023521|4|I had no problem suspending disbelief with respect to there being no significant rebellions in the book which deals, after all, with a mere microcosm in the space and time of the story arc, nor did I have a problem with the rationale for the \\"hunger games,\\" which seems to recapitulate the typical historical explanations for the gladiatorical spectacles of the Roman Empire.  The only bone I have to pick with the author has to do with the protagonist's (Katniss) temporary loss of hearing in one ear.  This should actually have been a very serious problem, of which the author is obviously not aware, since it occurs at a critical juncture in the storyline.  Deafness in one ear would mean that she cannot tell direction of sound, a possibly fatal condition for Katniss, since she is in a life-and-death struggle, not only as a hunter, but as the hunted.  In stalking her prey and being stalked, however, Katniss seems to magically hear stereophonically anyway.  I enjoyed the book in spite of having a problem suspending disbelief on what was to me a very important point.  I look forward to reading the rest of the trilogy.
B00006D295|5|the greatest movie and play ever made.

I also preordered the next book, Oceans, for all of them as well.  I wish I could give this 100 stars it's that amazing.

0937381888|5|Just before I started brewing a few months ago I read John Palmer's \\"How to Brew\\" website, which is an older version of the book online and is free.  It was very helpful in getting me started in this great hobby.  I've brewed a few batches and decided to buy the updated book.  I'm glad I did.  The book has a ton of great information, several recipes and goes a little bit into how to brew your own styles.  It has great info on hops, yeast, bottling, kegging and just about everything else.  If you are already brewing and you don't have this, you should get it.  If you are thinking about getting started, I would recommend checking out his website first and then buy the book after you brew your first batch.

B001IAOEXU|3|There's nothing adherently wrong with these triggers. The true problem lies with the buttons on the controller. Not even with the triggers does it feel responsive although it does help.
B00JJ3EHCG|1|pure trash...worst movie ever seen
B00CTEP7O4|5|Love this show!
B00AFEXRME|5|Love the whole movie. Have waiting for it to come out on DVD so I can buy for myself. Its great!
B00BUCW54Q|5|Didn't expect to like it. Wasn't like the book, but I did really like it.
B003K16P50|5|If you, like me, are a voracious reader, then you are on the lookout for books that tell their story in clever, unconventional ways.  This book has it in spades:  a silly British government and an impossible idea that the author leads us to believe in; all wrapped up in an unusual style.  I am ashamed to admit that this book was very low in my list to read.  Silly me.
0439023483|5|This book has all the qualities of a movie. It is something that I can see all the twilight fans getting addicted to. I am a picky reader and will not waste my time on any books that are average or below average. This one immediately jumps into the plot and starts rolling. You never feel bored in this book. I would recommend this to others. It is a bit brutal, so 14 and younger should probably stay away. But like I said in a few years this will be a movie.
B00HFX5ZT6|4|The movies are good and definitely well worth the money. It does not include digital copies so beware of that.
B007J4T2G8|1|This book was nothing short of pornography.  It is way over the top in outrageous scenarios that demean and belittle women.  This is the kind of GARBAGE that is shaping the next generation in this country. After YEARS of women fighting for respect and dignity, this book gives the impression that a woman should be HAPPY to be a man's slave. What a horrible message to send to our daughters AND sons.  Aren't there enough men in this world who are abusive and demeaning to women without giving them another HOW TO book. A friend said she had heard this was a best sellar. Intrigued, I purchased it online.  I returned this book for a full refund after the first 100 pages.  There is SO MUCH GOOD READING out the why would anyone CHOOSE to fill their minds with this SMUTT.
0596007124|5|It's almost impossible to fail with this book. By just reading through (do not skip any sections, no matter how silly they look!), all WHY's/HOW's will be soaked into your brain automatically. I read most of Head First books(EJB/Servlet&JSP deserve 5 stars, AJAX -4.5, HTML-4), but this is the best by far.<br /><br />You are wasting your time if you are still reading the reviews here.
B00006CXSS|5|Look I don't care if you buy this or just rent it, I just want you to watch this mini-series. Its &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; with a storyline and interesting characters. Just remember these words, WATCH THIS OR REGRET MISSING THE GREATEST MINI-SERIES OF ALL TIME, WATCH IT, WATCH IT NOW(or later).
B00881VLCE|4|Great game. Fun to play late at night, puts me to sleep.
B009DJB9HC|5|BCC has produced another very strong album which seems to reflect greater blending and coherence as a band.  Joe B's solos are less bombastic and fit tighter into the songs.  The lyrics seem better written and the vocals continue to be Glenn Hughes powerful and full of range and expression.  Joe's vocals are excellent as well and there's more blending of them with Glenn's.  I feel that the drumming is much stronger and tighter on this album.  The drum tone and the depth of the bass drum seem more distinctive and a little more up front than the first two albums.  I can also hear more Derek on keyboard.  More of the songs contain more of his significant contribution to the overall sound and feel of the songs.  I have heard rumors of infighting and that possibly this is the last album.  I hope this isn't so!  I would so much want to see this band live.  Can you imagine how big they would have been some years ago?
B00IMYSCR4|2|Big stars but not that great of a movie.
B00Y6QF0PE|5|What a refreshing change. So lovely to relive Christian and Anastasia's love through his eyes. Highly recommend to literature lovers.
B005D9MUWY|4|So far, I really like the actual keyboard, it's fast and accurate and the predictive text feature is impressive. The only thing I am not sure about is the fact that when not in use it shows as running and using 33 mbs of memory with no way to shut it down. I have used other keyboards and never seen this before.
B000JMKQX0|4|I really like this novel, even if Hollywood trashed it big time.
B003B02O0A|5|This was a 're read. It was great the first time and again the second. Now I am going to read Sycamore Row.
6304806418|5|Evita is mesmerizing. Although Lloyd Webber's music is often criticized for sounding all the same, which is true, this movie comes in the category of all music non-dialogue movie, like Umbrellas of Cherbourg.  Evita in the modern tradition is a one-song movie, like Hello Dolly and Damn Yankees. This is one of those. There are other songs in this one, but all the others sound much the same. But its haunting music pervades the movie ending in the conversion of its most famous song Don't Cry for Me, Argentina into a funeral dirge played as a slow tango, so appropriate.  Yes, this is one of the best movies to come out of London, yes London, not Broadway, like Cats and Phantom.  Broadway was just one stop on its road show.
B000002UB2|5|Who doesn't love the Beatles? The vinyl came on time, no scratches, it plays very well. I have no complaints.
B000JMKQX0|4|Creative style for telling a story! This was my first foray into the zombie genre and I was very impressed with Brooks' MANY different perspectives of the Zombie War. Excellent read.
B00005NKW3|3|There are some movies, despite their faults, that will never lose their place in America's heart.  Turn on your television up to two months before December 25th, and chances are you'll see a miniature Natalie Wood (who later starred in both West Side Story and Rebel Without a Cause) gazing into the twinkly eyes of a dwarfed and frighteningly jolly \\"Santa Claus\\" (Edmund Gwenn), telling him sternly that she does not believe he is really Kris Kringle.  You've stumbled upon one of the most famous holiday flicks in history: Miracle on 34th Street, filmed in glorious black and white.<BR> After 97 minutes of sugary, cheerful simplicity, little Susan (Natalie Wood) and the rest of New York has been convinced that Macy's Santa Claus is indeed the real thing--the crafty old man even tricks the United States government into believing in him.  As you can see, this is not the most realistic of all stories... though definitely optimistic in its assumption that the Supreme Court has the compassion to rule that reindeers can fly for the mere sake of saving a dying lunatic.<BR> Maureen O'Hara, who plays Susan's mom, does an awful job as an actress.  Every woman over the age of 50 will probably dismiss my naive judgment of their former idol, but, like most bad actresses of her day, I think O'Hara is over dramatic and extremely unrealistic.  In this way, her performance reflects the entire movie--very cute, yes, but leaving you with a sickeningly sweet aftertaste similar to that which can be obtained from listening to an entire album of sappy \\"White Christmas\\" remakes.
B000UD08HW|4|If you're expecting film quality on this 1080p blu ray your going to be dissapointed.  First of all the video was recorded in 1080i and then transfered to the blu ray format.  When you take in to account this is a live show with lighting for a show, not for a tv production, you end up with a lot of noise and blown out video in the spotlight.  Overall though its an amazing show and if you have a good receiver you can take the audio bitstream uncompressed, (sounds great)  I recommend this show for all pink floyd fans, just don't expect to be WOWed by the video quality.
B0054JZC6E|5|its a great app I love playing the games and so do my kids. I love the competition of everyone trying to beat the high scores.
B000R7GKQE|4|excellent character development of the brothers. great stories with new twists. one ofthe most enjoyable programs I've seen in all my years
B00C1BU7V8|5|I was unprepared to see such extraordinary acting, historical significance and great cinematography. I really enjoyed Sally Fields' performance in this film.
B00MBTKA2G|5|No review
B0071XO8RA|5|Darn you Hugh Howey!  I've spent the last few days reading Wool at every opportunity, except when interrupted by trivial and less important things like family and work.  Now that I'm done, I'm left with this empty, desperate feeling like an addict that needs their next fix.  What have you done to me Hugh!<br /><br />Seriously, I loved this book.  Great concept, character development and dramatic appeal.  If you are a fan of apocalyptic literature, seasoned with suspense and still believing that there is hope for mankind, then Wool is a must read.
B006C1DH92|4|I never really got into fruit ninja but had to leave a review after reading the first review...ah-hahaha &quot;Why would it even be in a boot?&quot; hahaha its the name of the cat...that cat even has his own movie plus he has been around since Shrek 2. some people wanna complain about everything.  &quot;Merry Christmas&quot;, &quot;you mean happy holidays right?&quot;
B0055PGUYU|4|The power of habit is an interesting reading. The cases that Mr.Duhigg used to illustrate his points are unique. I recommend this book to any audience looking to understand how habits works.
B007SGLZP8|4|I could not put this book down.  It was a believable story. I would recommend this book to every Grisham fan.
B00AFROVQC|3|First book was a bit fast-paced to the point that it left the reader wondering \\"wow, does this kid have everything?!\\" However, it was pretty contrived (the inexperienced and untrained main character saves the day at least half a dozen times, among other things) and that's why I hesitate to give 4 stars--although I'm confident some other readers wouldn't hesitate to do so. Overall, not a bad read.<br /><br />Unfortunately, where book one has a fast moving plot with many (and somewhat unnecessary) developments, I found book 2 to be pretty slow and book 3 just painful to read. However, for $2.99 it's hard to complain!
B0061S073A|2|This parental control app did not have enough flexibility for what I needed.  It says it works with Kindle Free time, but not well enough for my liking.
B002UWH8P6|5|Great series!!! Wish there was more seasons .
B007ZGO7EM|5|Something doesn't add up. By my calculations the numbers should be all good. And well they are. It's like adding two and two together, it just works. This app really got my number with its deduction skills. Perhaps someday I'll be able to get to the square root of things and finally figure out who number 2 works for.
B008IJTFYW|5|very relaxing, it helps to create a focal point so that i can stop my day and other thoughts from stampeding over my attempts to fall asleep.
B0093OGBL6|5|I am going to start my review out by telling you all that MICHAEL JACKSON has taught me and brought me closer to GOD for I feel you need to have this sense of feeling of a Human being and not just as a entertainer. I believe the world for this crucified him in this century, MICHAEL JACKSON gave over $350.00 million dollars to charity by here are a few examples of his teaching spiritually.<br />1. MICHAEL JACKSON thank you for reminding me to tell GOD please forgive me for complaining, help me to remember that every tiI me I have a headache, someone I know may have a hidden heartache; ever time I don't like the food, millions have nothing to eat every time I thin my paycheck is too small, too many people have no paycheck at all, every time I wish my loved ones were not so demanding some people have no one to L.O.V.E., when I look around at my blessings my complaints seem little, help me GOD to be grateful for my every day gifts of family, food and home...L.O.V.E...L.O.V.E..HEAL THE WORLD...L.O.V.E. ♥♥♥<br />2. MICHAEL JACKSON reminded me that GOD is the faithful one, who will never surrender, never give in and MICHAEL brought us closer to GOD, for he showed us GOD is always with us and will never have to handle any tragedy alone, he taught us GOD is all the hope, all L.O.V.E., and to turn to you now for the power that makes all things new again,for you are the faithful one, we know to live to fulfill you will, no matter where it leads us or what we may have to face, we shall walk without fear, move without doubt and live without confusion for you are the light and I you are also the faithful one....L.O.V.E.....L.O.V.E...♥♥♥HEAL THE WORLD..♥♥♥<br />So gave you spiritually what I BELIEVE that MICHAEL JACKSON has taught the world spiritually and I BELIEVE & KNOW you should bye DEFENDING A KING HIS LIFE & LEGACY so you can understand how horrible this world treated this beautiful angel, yes he was a human like we all are but with the book learn about how great of a father he was, his legacy, all facts, healer and humanitarian, his finances, his family and many more facts of truth that the world needs to know and understand so they will quit calling him a horrible names....I L.O.V.E. you MICHAEL JACKSON and will always defend you now & forever in my heart.♥♥♥<br />By: Dietra Elaine Beatty
B00993I6D2|1|Start off like a bad Apple commercial and goes downhill from there; could not more than 1/2 hour of it!
0316666343|4|The Lovely Bones is a strong book that provides a compelling and well written exploration of death.  Her characters are well contructed and provide a believable foundatation for their reactions and interactions.  <br />This story is about a family dealing with a horrible crime.  The crime is told in grisley detail.  People who have problems with graphic violence will have problems with this book.  Not everyone will want to read or finish this book.  Those who do will find a way to explore how a heartrending tragedy can break a family and how the family members can find ways to heal again.

B00I8H6MGS|5|This has been on the New Release list for a while now and I kept passing it by, just because I did not see from the movie description how it could play out as anything other than another sad story about Aids.  McConaughey was excellent and Jennifer played her role to subtle perfection.  However, the story was amazing to watch play out and brought issues to my attention that I never considered before not just with that terrible disease but others as well.  I have a habit of keeping my IPad on my lap to fact check during all movies that are &#34;based&#34; on true stories.  I really did not want to do that with this one.  I am and was perfectly fine enjoying the movie and appreciating the story told completely as is, without googling through every scene!
B00KGL7Y6Q|5|Fantastic heart wrenching show where history comes alive. I just wish there was more.
B00QW8TYWO|5|Fantastic time waster
B0000667RO|4|I like the 2 CD collection by him better.  He is a great artist.
B00SXK316E|5|Well, my wife really loves it!  So I give it 5 stars for making her happy.
B00KTDD69A|1|I deleted this. Graphics were awful and it kept crashing, I have this game on my PC and thought it would be the same.  While the game itself is the same, it is not of the same quality
B00E8KLWB4|5|Love the game....Don' like the waiting. Just download another game to split up the time!
B00EMXBDMA|5|Simply great story telling. Andy Weir is obviously technically competent in the physical sciences, however he is also a great story teller. The plot development and cliff hangers are awesome and not telegraphed. You feel the story. Simply awesome writing. I honestly can't believe this is his first book. Please don't stop. Your a awesome talent!
B00CSR2J9I|4|Good app
B000O76T90|5|This is a great one to get if you like the die hard movies.
6305320802|2|As many others have stated, the picture quality on this DVD is terrible, much worse than the other O &amp; H musicals which Fox released in the same series. At times, it looks more like an MPEG movie than a DVD. Save your money until they bring out a restored &quot;collectors&quot; edition.<BR>Shame on you, Fox, for wasting people's money!
B00IJJUIMY|3|Harry seems to be to old to mix it up
B007SYWFRM|5|I love the game. It is nicely addictive.  I love that I don't have to play it all day to get somewhere. My biggest complaint is that at a certain point in the game you need a lot of nuts to finish your families and unfortunately if you don't wanna buy them they are really hard to come by. Now I have a lot of money but nothing to buy with it and I would need a lot of nuts to finish my families. And nuts is what I don't have. :(
B000009O8A|1|Forget Plan Nine,forget every movie you ever heard was the worst ever.This is it.A sick and depraved exercise in rape and revenge.Thats it, a woman  gets raped and gets her revenge.No character developement neccessary.Just a  girl and 3 rapists.The movies brutal depiction of the plot is ultra  realistic,almost in a supposed snuff film way.I do'nt know who's idea of  entertainment this would be,but it's not even worth it for those who live  where the thing was banned.No one should watch this it's just sick. The one  good thing about this is it's an excellent reason to buy a DVD player.If  any company would waste time releasing this on DVD then the floodgates must  be opening and everything you can think of will be coming soon.
B00K7C17QW|3|Only get 80 for energy, and it takes a LONG time to collect stars. Need to make it a little quicker to get a star. Also, when the crime is solved, it would be nice to be able to collect the rest of the stars and be able to trade them in for energy that could be used later, like Criminal Case does.
B000001FFR|4|this 1985 masterpiece from anthrax is the follow up to fistfull of metal,both are high quality metal discs,this disc is awesome!this disc along with others kickstarted the thrash/speed metal scene which had been growing since the early 80`s,to me this disc has it`s place in metal lore,along with slayer,metallica megadeath,exodus,known as the big 5 that basically changed the world of heavy music.this is a classic disc and anthrax is a classic band,
159514188X|5|It is a really great novel talking about things from different perspectives in a relationship. it shows how the littlest things you say or your actions against another person can have such a large impact. Another thing to mention is that during those adolescent years so many events can occur and you might not even be aware of it.
B00BAXFECK|5|quick delivery
B00AIUUXHC|4|The only downsides are ads after every run (which is barely acceptable, maybe go down to every other run) and not being able to eat what are, size wise at least, smaller sharks. As a Mako level max I tried eating a hammerhead half my size and it says I'm not big enough? But I can eat stingrays twice my size? But minute details aside, its still fun.
0307408833|1|Like other reviewers, I pre-ordered this book when a friend told me about it. I was so excited, and made up a couple of the recipes, following the instructions to the letter. What a let down! The muffins and cupcakes were so dry! The frosting was disappointing too.    At first I thought it was just me, and the way I was making up the recipes (even though I've been baking for years). However, at a friend's birthday party, the hostess ordered cupcakes from Babycakes specially for my daughter, who refused to eat them. The chocolate cupcake was, quite frankly, inedible; and she turned the other two (vanilla and one other kind) down flat - and this is not a child to turn her back on sweet treats! So much for Babycakes.     I was also stunned to see an entire chapter of spelt recipes, in a book that boasts of being \\"gluten free.\\" If you go to the trouble of adding the qualifier \\"mostly sugar free,\\" why can't you put \\"mostly gluten free\\" on the cover? Ever hear of truth in advertising? Apparently not. We can get gluten-full recipes anywhere, any time. What a sham!    This book has everything, or so it would seem: glossy photos worthy of a fashion magazine; celebrity endorsements and beautiful photography. What it doesn't have is honest-to-goodness recipes that can stand alone and speak for themselves.    For a no-nonsense approach to gluten-free cooking that gets the job done, and doesn't require a ton of ingredients, I would recommend \\"The Best Ever Wheat- and Gluten-Free Baking Book\\" by Mary Ann & Mace Wenniger; or \\"Flying Apron's Gluten-Free & Vegan Baking Book\\" by Jennifer Katzinger. These books are great: no hype, fewer ingredients, and, for the most part, great results. Bon appetit!
B008I34ZFW|5|Very Funny.. Enjoyed very much...
B008673ZAQ|5|Love this series. Sylvia Day  writes an amazing, easy to read book that leaves you on the edge of your seat for more.
B00794ML3Y|5|This is a great show.  The acting is very good and the storyline is great.
B00BUCW54Q|4|lots of destruction and a pretty smart movie. Definitely worth your time.
B0089EHWQE|4|The characters were brought to life and their anguish was felt by the reader.  Unfortunately love does not conquer all and the idea of living a totally dependent life was out of the question for the long haul.
B00IX9UTLU|4|I could hardly put the book down! Liked that Hudson and Alayna both had issues and that they &#34;fixed&#34; each other. Bombed that it's now finished and can't wait to read Hudson!
0670024783|5|A beautiful story and beautifully told.  Everyone should enjoy this book.<br />Patty
B00G4I1CLS|5|This is a hard to watch but need to see movie as it takes the blinders off what's going on at Seaworld. I love Seaworld but it's time they put the big animals back in the ocean. Some things are just right no matter the cost.
0736430512|5|Good read.
031606792X|2|I had looked forward to the final story in this series. However, Breaking Dawn seems to have taken a huge left turn toward an overdone scifi plot device. The fourth book feels barely connected with the previous three books at all. Bella is largely unrecognizable as the character we knew before. Edward is diminished almost to a secondary character. Issues and themes from the first three books are dropped or simply solved with the introduction of new backstory. Everyone in the book gets everything they want and the reader is left unsatisfied.<br /><br />If you've read the previous books of the series, the desire to see them to conclusion will be very strong. However, you may find yourself very disappointed and wishing you had stopped at Eclipse.
B002ZG9846|5|She steals the show, but the guy does a great job definitely.  Fun movie and a lot of action.  Banana Splits music scene was cool for all you oldies who remember that show back in the early 70's.
B0094KF4WG|5|A really interesting and informative account of the capture of Bin Laden, but more so of the intelligence, effort and resilience required of those in the Navy Seals to do the very difficult tasks they are prepared to do.
B0074VTHKM|4|This is a fun read. It doesn't have the intensity of some Grisham books, but it does keep you interested. I read this one in the series first, but I wish I'd read them in order.
B00HDMMISA|4|I really liked this book.  It was interesting in that the way it was written, you knew that something bad was going to happen at the end of the story from the very beginning; you just knew when and where, but you never knew who until the very end.  I would recommend this to others.
B00DDQ5S3M|4|Good game no company makes plane games with graphics this good.you  paid 4.99 for the game and all the aircraft cost $24.99 same with the locations you can fly in.

B0032VGKJO|1|Case was damaged Put DvD in a brand system jumped skipped un watchable complete waste of time money and very sad .. I will honestly have to buy anther copy.
B007UPNA6Y|4|All his books are great
B00H2EQFBK|4|Better than I expected, not as gory as it could've been considering the weapons used. It was hard to keep track of what was going on, though, due to jumps in the story timeline. I guess that streaming made some of the timeline gaps more apparent.
B0026P3G12|5|Susan has a beautiful voice and I love the variety on this CD. She sang everything to rock, spiritual to Christmas.
1932907009|5|I'll be honest, I bought other books after this one, but most were unecessary.  Blake Snyder tells you everything you need to know and you can fight it, like I did and buy other books thinking it was more complex than that or..you know you can just believe me and the book and know that this is it.  Nothing more.  Nothing less.
B00A6N8F4Y|5|Very Good flic. The beautiful fiance and I enjoyed it. So did the friends. Recommend this movie to everyone. This is a great buy.
B00005JOMN|1|I'd been looking forward to Mann's return to MV since hearing of it - though I was disturbed to hear that Farrell would feature (after his appearence in the comedy Alexandra). Mann directed one of my favourite films - Thief (Violent Streets). <br /> <br />Unfortunately I and my wife only lasted 20 minutes of the film - the print was poor at our Cineworld venue in Stockport, with numerous black lines on either side of the print and one large one running down dead center. What was funny was listening to the cinema manager trying to persuade me that Michael Mann, using digital cameras for outside (and interior scenes?) had added these wear lines in post-production (for gritty realism apparently). When persuaded to come and have a look he immediately admitted that the print was stuffed. We got our money back just in time to hear additional complaints being reported over his walkie-talkie by staff. So much for the movie industries desire to persuade folk not to buy pirate DVD's - the cinema prints can be even worse! <br /> <br />So beware, at least one duff print of Miami Vice is about in the UK.
B001GKJ2DO|5|My wife loves this movie.
B003XRELGQ|5|Simply loved it. A unique take on the end of the world, an eye opener for anyone with an open mind.

Language of the book is very easy to understand without artificially fancy words and phrases. It has enough of reality as well as a bit of mystery. Very skillfully done. I suspect it could be used for really good screenplay as well.
B00FVZJUS2|5|I downloaded this movie for my son but honestly I find myself stopping to watch it. There are some really cute parts that will make all ages laugh. It's fun, colorful, and has some hidden meaning that will keep adults entertained. The minions are so much fun! Love it!! Hope they make a 3rd.
B00632HWOG|3|the app isn't fast&hellip; but it isn't  slow either. it does what i need to do quick email checks. slow to load images, however that could also be my first gen kindle fire. I preferred using the kindle email, but when yahoo made recent changes it no longer works.
B0050DIWFC|5|It was very well done. Tests your faith in a child. How friends and neighbors will react when you find yourself in a terrible situation. Very well dramatized.
B00B49GSOS|5|I ordered the Hobbit right before Xmas and was very pleased I received it in time to wrap and place under the tree.  Really enjoyed this movie.
B000000W6R|5|I think this is a great CD. Being a B-sides and rarities collection CD, you'd probably expect the songs to be not so good. However, this is one of my favorite CDs from the Pumpkins. It has awesome hard rock songs like Pissant, Hello Kitty Kat, and Girl Named Sandoz (I think they do an awesome cover of the original version by the Animals). Also, their are peaceful, slower songs like Soothe and La Dolly Vita. Overall, it's an awesome CD and I highly recommend it.
B0000AQS0F|5|LOVE this series!!!
B0049985XW|5|Love the DVD - great print. Arrived very quickly- March 4th when Ordered on March 1st - how did you do that? The envelope was ripped open on the side - completely - but the videos were inside and the packing list. Post Office? Yes I think so.<br />This is a great print and really not a problem occurred watching it. Very glad to have it. Thank you.
B009XIXVU6|4|I would have liked to know how the characters were intertwined. This book was hard for me to read. :-)
B007SGM084|2|For a fun, easy romance story, go here. If you are a diehard for literary significance, deeper meaning and extremely accurate vocabulary, don't go here. If you like novels that invoke emotions that you forgot you had, go here. If you have a soft stomach for the graphically intense bordering on pornographic, yeah... Don't go here. I'm not sure that this should be allowed on any shelf where a tall... Thirteen-year-old can reach it, nor am I sure that the author had a dictionary present at all times. Or a thesaurus. But as far as fun, kick-your-feet-up reads go, I rather enjoyed it. When I didn't want to throttle Ana or Mr. Grey, that is.
B0000035E7|5|This album is really really good and different from what Nirvana was after this,the songs are in a garage-style that sounds awesome,every song is cool, i cannot think of a weak song here,the opening BLEW will just blow you away,and the following tracks are just as good and better,PAPER CUTS is a creepy song with frightening vocals and dark lyrics,it rocks! NEGATIVE CREEP is fast and amazing,and the closing track DOWNER is one of the best in the album (that's why it was on INCESTICIDE too)the verses are kinda weird for beng Nirvana but they're really great and the pre-chorus and chorus are just the best way to finish an album,that song is on my top ten Nirvana songs,anyway,this album is very good,i highly recommend it,GET IT NOW!

B00AIUUXHC|5|This and Temple Run have been my favorite games so far on Kindle.  I have spent countless plane trips knocking into my seat neighbor trying to gobble up as many humans as I can.  The graphics are great, the level advancement is easy yet still somewhat challenging, and the gore is just enough not to traumatize any children.
B00G2GMRCU|5|Great story line.  I wish it could have been a full book.  I wonder if Robie and the Camel Club are going to hook up in later books.
B000YDOOUK|5|I've seen lots of live shows, something close to 250 bands.  Some of the best were Pantera, White Zombie, Kyuss, Quicksand...  I recently saw Airbourne play live.  I have the CD and there is no mistaking that they are straight ahead bar room brawling Aussie pub rock.  Every song is high energy, hook laden, all built around shout out loud choruses.  This is rock in roll for good times, nothing more and nothing less.  BUT, seeing these guys live is a sight to behold.  I have never witnessed the balls out energy that they delivered for a straight 50 minutes.  At one point I felt a G-force kick in due to the break neck intensity they created.  Granted, some of the songs sound a bit similar to one another, but it didn't matter when you could see the look in the guys eyes when they were bringing the house down.  No joke, when these Aussie rockers made eye contact, there was a touch of lunacy there that made one wonder if they would slip off the rails as they ripped into each of their rock anthems.  This was one of the best live shows I have ever seen!  No lies here, Airbourne is an amazing live band, so don't miss them!
B00MFDNRQO|3|ok
B00BAXFACO|4|I don't like the Lincoln Lawyer books as much as Harry Bosch, but this one is pretty good. There were several twists I wasn't expecting at all and one \\"loose end\\" that I wish had been resolved. The ending seemed a bit rushed, too. One minute the courtroom is in chaos, the next it's six months later. If you like Connelly, you'll like this, but I'm waiting for the next Bosch book.

B008RKI9O4|5|This is one of the greatest dark comedies of all time.  It also features a wonderful soundtrack of songs by Cat Stevens.

B00005UEAR|4|This is a must for Dream Theater fans, but if you're not acquainted with DT, I'd steer clear of this album until you're more accustomed to their writing styles.  <br /> <br />CD one if full of independent songs (unlike, as another reviewer put it, one flowing song that follows onto disc 2), and there are many classics to be heard here, such as The Glass Prison (which Mike Portnoy wrote the lyrics for, based on his AA experiences).  <br /> <br />CD two starts off with the album's only instrumental, Overture, which is a mix between classical writing styles and rock instrumentation. Track 2, About to Crash, is a light-ish track with a nice piano solo to start (which for LTE fans is reminiscent of Biaxident). Tracks 3 and 4 are a lot heavier, and there's some nice riffage going on there. Track 5, Goodnight Kiss, is one of the lightest songs on the album, and has a great bluesy-type solo towards the end. Solitary shell, track 6, again is a lighter track which features a nice improv-solo from Rudess. Track 7, About to Crash Reprise, has what is probably the most catchy riff on the album, and starts off very optimistic-sounding, but turns very dark by the end, which leads perfectly into the finale of the album, which, by an astounding coincidence, is called Grand Finale. Again, the classical element of Six Degrees comes back into this song with an epic sounding string ensemble opening the track, and this track is also very dark. The only problem I have with the last track is that it fades out very slowly at the end (taking about 1:30 to fade out fully), and this can get annoying when in a playlist with other albums. <br /> <br />To clear up a few points made by a previous reviewer - it does not follow on the story from SFaM, disc 1 and 2 are independent of each other in terms of music and lyrics, disc 2 was NOT recorded in 1 take (and unless your hours have 43 mins in them, it's not an hour long).
B00CKOYVG8|4|I think there should be more games that you can get 3 stars without buying helps. some of the games are very hard to get one star with without heps

6300215814|4|This movie will remain an Audrey Hepburn classic.People say that she was miscasted in this movie but I don't think so.She did a good job as the sophisticated Holly Golightly.Her costars did good jobs as well.I loved the costumes in this movie!They were so stylish and sophisticated but simple.I must warn you though this movie is long and that is the only thing I do not like about it. I love the song she sings in this movie.I also love the party scenes, the tiffany's scenes, and the last scene where she admits she is in love with her neighbor author Paul Varjak played by George Peppard.When I first saw this movie I did not know that her Asian neighbor was Mickey Rooney!They did a good make up job!I love this movie so I hope you will see it in the future.I hope this review helps!
B00PRSOG1E|5|[Please note this review has been edited to reflect my progress, but the game's verdict remains the same]  Game mechanism is similar to Little Galaxy & TA: Little Red Riding Hood: Tap to hop from one rotating planet to the next. Game objective, however, is different - you are not trying to reach as many planets as possible, nor is there a &#34;destination&#34; planet; instead, you just try to collect all the stars that lie between the planets. There is no time-limit, and you won't &#34;die&#34; because it all happens in a wrap-around playing area.  While ORBB doesn't have the beautiful graphics found in the other two games, its minimal yet adequate visuals do not detract from its simple yet engrossing gameplay. You might think this is relaxing game, but there is no shortage of challenges such as having to collect certain stars in the right order as introduced in Phase 3, having to contend with anti-gravity as in Phase 4, and purple planets that disappear after one jump in Phase 5. They are just not as frustrating and - having completed the game - I can report that all levels are solvable*.  This game contains no malware or anything that you should worry about. It does use the Internet but seems primarily for Amazon services. If you are paranoid, you can always disable your Internet connection; this game runs fine offline. It doesn't have an exit button nor does the Back key work to quit the game; you'll have to press the Home key & swipe it off your Recent Apps menu. Anyway its CPU usage seems minimal while in the background. I saw the &#34;Rate Me&#34; prompts only twice through all 60 levels (after completing 2-5 & 4-15) which, to be fair, weren't too frequent but I do wish they would tuck it away in the main menu & let the player decide.  In summary, the game itself deserves a 5 for its regular price of $0.99. I would have taken half-a-point away for the lack of a clean exit & the rating reminder, but I am quite happy to round it up rather than down because of its solid play value.  * In the later stages where both wormholes & anti-gravity are at play, you might find yourself caught in a loop. I encountered it only once in 5-14. Simply replay the level. If the screen becomes blank on starting a new level, exit the game and restart. No harm done.

B00S1M7KXO|5|Loved the CD, glad I purchased it.
B000BTC5LW|4|Pay no attention to those who fault the audio in the PULSE DVD.  In my full-blown 5.1 home-theater system, the audio is phenomenal (you even have two audio qualities to select from). The DVD audio is defnitely superior to the CD audio; enough said about the audio.  Now, the criticism of the video is justified--grainy and pixelated on my 50\\" plasma when the camera pans/zooms out to the full stage and merely okay when the camera zooms in on individual band members.  There's do doubt the light show is over-the-top, but I'm slightly sad the video is sub-par (yes, Gilmour says he made a mistake by not taping on film).  The Eagle Hell Freezes Over DVD from the same Vintage is better.  If the video were as good as the recent U2 DVD concert releases, this PULSE DVD might have been one of greatest of all time.  ...Now, onto the content of the DVD.  Many have already written extensively about most of the DVD.  But for me, the surprise performance is \\"Sorrow.\\"  The band rocks THE hardest on this track.  Nick Mason behind the drum kit looks like he actually breaks a sweat near the end of the track, whereas he's mostly passive through most of the other songs.  Rick Wright also moves around his his keyboards more than other songs, and Gilmour rips a mean guitar on this one.  I've liked this track for years on the PULSE CD, but the visuals behind it give it much more heft.  This track is absolutely fantastic.
0061564893|3|From my own experience in Mexico up in the mountains close to Tepic, we visited a Huichole Indian village and heard that a Korean girl had once visited and understood their language.  In fact she came back and translated the Bible for them.  Over time I have run into more Koreans who have understood a lot of the linguistics for the Apache and other North American Indian tribes.    This book is plausible.

B000002BVN|4|With the international success of Michael's 1995 opus, 'HIStory: Past, Present and Future Book 1, this album was designed to kick off the first leg of his international tour. The first five songs on this CD are some of  Michael's best works. Starting with the song, 'Blood On The Dance Floor'  this album get's off to a good start. Teaming up with longtime pal and  producer Teddy Riley, Michael finds a swing with this song that he didn't  have on any song since Dangerous. A great song, but not his best like the  second song on this CD is. 'Morphine' is a towering piece of music! Written  and composed by the singer himself, it builds frustration and anger all in  one. Not a happy song, but the greatest song he has ever done. In the liner  notes for production of this puppy, he is listed under: lead vocals,  background vocals, arrangement, classical arrangement, vocal arrangement,  rhythm arrangement, percussion, drums and guitar (with Slash as well). What  other POP artist is so involved in the making of the music? Now 'Superfly  Sister' sounds too 80's, I don't like it personally, one of the few Michael  Jackson songs I don't like, there are only 3 that I don't like. 'Ghosts'  kicks, he hooks up with Teddy Riley on this one again, and this song is  slammin', should have been a huge hit everywhere. The last of the new  songs, 'Is It Scary' is a personal song for Michael, the lyrics suggest so.  Another great POP song. Now the remainder of the album consists of songs  from his 1995 album HIStory, which are remixed by some young producer's and  hit maker's. The remix of 'Sream (with Janet Jackson)' is great, as are the  remixe's of: 'Money', 'Stranger In Moscow', 'This Time Around', 'Earth  Song' and 'HIStory.' A great album, but if you are going to buy it, buy it  for the first five songs (minus 'Superfly Sister') and you will agree that  it is a great album worth the money spent. Four out of Five
B00AREIAI8|5|Awesome game!! so glad it came out for the kindlefire! i love that u actually get to compete instead of where u tell ur horse to compete and then a pop up says congradulations! u got 1st place! its actually on u whether or not u win. best horse game in amazon stores.

B001EC3JME|5|I'm a patrol supervisor at a security company and this holds my tactical flashlight well and offers quick access for building checks.(I work nights), I also recommend this product to all of the officers I supervise. Nite Ize's awesome belt clip also fits securely on my 2 inch duty belt which was hard to find. I also purchased their sport case tone for my smartphone for the simple fact its hard to find holsters for many supplies that'll fit a duty rig, and again a purchased a sideways phone case for regular wear. The only problem with the light holder was that the one shipped to me had a loose connection to the clip so I will be returning it, it was a QC flaw, I went to Harbor Freight and bought a working one.

0547884591|3|I can't decide whether I love this book or hate it! I love it because Ferriss is VERY generous with his information and telling you EXACTLY how to do things so they work. His first book, \\"The 4 Hour Work Week,\\" was jammed packed with good ideas as is this book. But...<br /><br />First of all, the book weighs a TON. Good quality paper and binding of over 650 pages makes for a very heavy tome. As an e-book, it might make sense but for cookbooks I will admit to being biased against an e-book format: I need to be able to easily flip back and forth to various parts of a cookbook but that's just me.<br /><br />Secondly, although the title of this book is \\"The 4 Hour Chef\\", the sub-title - \\"The simple path to cooking like a pro, learning anything, and living the good life\\" - says it all: it's really a book about learning anything in the minimum amount of time...which Ferriss admits up-front. The main topic for this book just happens to be cooking...<br /><br />...which leads to my dilemma of whether I love it or hate it. There are useful nuggets of info strewn all over the book about different subjects (swimming, chess, languages, and I love those) but if you haven't put a bookmark in those places, it's almost impossible to find them again (arrgh) - which is the part I hate because they're not in any particular order that makes sense to find them.<br /><br />There are interesting recipes but again they're all over the map: from a simple omelet to turbacon - a turducken stuffed into a medium sized pig!<br /><br />And then there are entire sections that personally I would skip - how to catch a pigeon (!), gut a deer, kill a chicken, etc.<br /><br />Bottom line - I'm sticking with my 3 stars because I don't hate the book but I also don't love it. :)

B00003CXFG|4|If you like Vin Diesel you can't go wrong with this one.
B00C5R7B0I|2|The crime story is fine but as all the characters continue to age (Kay, Lucy, Marino, Janet, etc), all the interpersonal relationships and incidents from the past get way too confusing. And Cornwell spends a LOT of pages on them and their complicated relationships. Remember when Kay left Richmond about 8 or 9 books ago? I certainly didn't, but it plays a key part in this book as does some important case in Connecticut that I know nothing about ( I didn't read book #20). Heaven help the first time reader starting with book #19 or 20 or 21 (this one). I think Patricia Cornwell ought to do what John Sandford did: retire Kay Scarpetta or put her in the background and start a new series around Lucy or a brand new character. Sandford did it really well letting Lucas Davenport take a back seat to the new younger guy, Virgil Flowers.
B005KELQEU|4|My wife and I were looking for a sleeve/cover for our kindles.  None of the stores around here carried anything that could be used for this purpose.

The only thing missing was a pocket on outside where someone could store a wipe or something.  overall vry pleased with item.

B00HDMMISA|5|This book is so real and down to earth! It will make you laugh and relate in many different ways!
B004DMIIUU|5|This 2009 film is among the most visually spectacular ever made. The picture compositions are thoroughly artistic, and the live and animated actions simply fantastic. The castings are also very charismatic, and the story tense and dramatic, heightened with some passionate epical music, making it altogether a captivating movie to watch from start to finish.<br /><br />Then again, it is largely a fantasy movie which uses some historic background to tell an epic story, surrounding the three famous Warlords who successively conquered Japan, and a legendary figure Goemon which has little factual basis. The story made Goemon adopted as a kid by the first conqueror Oda Nobunaga to be trained as a shinobi (ninja). However, when Lord Nobunaga was dead by betrayal in 1582, Goemon fled his castle to become eventually a thief widely applauded by the common folks like Robin Hood.<br /><br />The movie began 15 years after the death of Nobunaga, when Goemon uncovered accidentally a conspiracy during a theft, namely, Lord Hideyoshi who succeeded Nobunaga was actually one of the conspirators who betrayed him. A main story here is about Goemon's repeated actions to kill the Lord. His first try only killed Hideyoshi's decoy. His second attempt was to save his girlfriend from Hideyoshi primarily, but he aborted the assassination after some moral struggle.<br /><br />His third act was motivated by Hideyoshi's brutal murder of his shinobi friend Saizo. It is through Saizo's mouth that the film lashed out the heartfelt feelings of the people about the Warlords. Through the last words of Lord Hideyoshi the film also examined the motives of the one who sought absolute power. Historical sources said Toyotomi Hideyoshi did launch massive attacks into Korea in 1592 and 1597, but were driven back with China's forces before his death in 1598.<br /><br />A recurring message in the film concerns about the consequences of vengeance, particularly self-centered, rash actions against the authority powers. The film ended with Goemon slashing through armies to kill the ruthless lord Mitsunari, reaching a position to kill another lord Leyasu also. But Goemon refrained instead to beseech him to end the warrings so that people could live happily. Historians said Tokugawa Leyasu was the third Warlord who succeeded to unify Japan, to be followed by centuries of peace relatively.<br /><br />One can see that the themes are complex and serious : war and peace, brutality, betrayal, revenge, perseverance, love, friendship, ..... However, many storylines are unrealistic, and many scenes surreal, such as  cross-cultural architectures and costumes, and supernatural actions like video games. It is obvious the film is laden with symbolic meanings, and the entertainment factors are high, with many gorgeous designs and rich colors of intense tones and contrasts. Watching it in black and white gives one an impressive classical feel, especially when setting it in high contrast and a bit brighter.<br /><br />The fireflies depicted many times in the movie make me wonder if the director has watched the spectacular BBC series \\" Planet Earth \\" released internationally in 2007. The \\" Caves \\" episode has some scenes showing how the glowworms secreted silk threads to trap their preys. The ending theme song \\" Rosa \\" was performed by the band ' Violet UK ', which stands for ' Red (anger) & Blue (sadness) Underground Kingdom '. The producer Ichise is known for making many Horror films in Japan. Kiriya the director is finishing a third epic film said to be called \\" The Last Knights \\", starring Clive Owen and Morgan Freeman.

B003L16FAE|2|They sure cleaned up the grain from this classic.  Maybe over did it a bit.  They made everyone's skin look so smooth, they all look like they were made out of wax and don't have any pores on their faces.  The clarity and HD is inconsistent.  Stick with the regular special edition DVD.  If you already have that one, don't waste your money getting this one.  The second star is just because it's one of my favorite films of all time.

B005ZOBNOI|5|My 25 year old son was reading this and recommended I read it.  I think after reading it, that I had read it before but this second time made it as sweet and memorable as the first.  We had a similar comment in our house for different reasons to not use the cancer card, so this bool reads close to the heart and very sweet.  It is not for one who dones not appreciate a true and romantic book about young love, but it is one that I enjoyed and will read again and again to remind myself how lucky I am.

B007NU54H4|5|The Movie (Plot, Characters, Music, Etc.): I was skeptical when the first Tinker Bell movie was released, but since then my 4 year old daughter and almost 2 year old son have fallen in love with this series and have collected each installment, including this latest addition, Secret of the Wings.<br /><br />The first thing I love about Wings is that it's another expansion of the Pixie Hollow universe. This is the reason &#34;The Great Fairy Rescue&#34; is my least favorite, because the fairies and their world, not just Tinkerbell's antics, are what I love the most. Wings does not disappoint here though! We get to see the world of the Winter fairies which has plenty in common with the &#34;warm fairies&#34; as they're called in this movie all of a sudden, but also plenty of differences! It's a new magical world for Tink to explore with new fairies to meet and adventures to be had.<br /><br />The animation seems to keep getting better and better. The music is magical and the voice acting is spot on as always. We don't see much of Terrence in this one, but we see plenty of the other characters, including a short side story with the Queen herself (I forget her name...)<br /><br />I especially enjoyed this one because of the introduction of Tinkerbell's sister, Perriwinkle. They have an instant bond as sisters that is animated very well and is very real. The love is there and it warms your heart to watch the siblings work together to overcome obstacles and never get into a single tiff along the way. I was waiting for the usual &#34;We meet, we love each other, oh but now we have a fight, and the climax of the movie is we forgive each other&#34; plot but that, thankfully, never came. These leaves kids and their siblings only with kind thoughts and the inspiration to work together and be there for one another which is great.<br /><br />As an adult, I kind of saw the real ending coming even so and wish we hadn't had to just add some action in there at the end for a good climax and no other reason, but I also didn't mind the ending. It was a nice conclusion and I can't wait to see the next Tinkerbell adventure.<br /><br />Special Features: The special features are the usual fair, with music videos and whatnot. My daughter and I enjoyed the short bonus clip featuring Tinkerbell and a Halloween Jack-o'-Lantern. I am also now kicking myself because the 20-some minute long &#34;Pixie Hollow Games&#34; movie is also included on both discs! I bought this by itself on Amazon instant video for 2.99 before Secret of the Wings had been released.<br /><br />The Pixie Hollow Games features the garden fairies with Rosetta being our lead character for this feature. Think the Olympics with fairies, and the garden fairies have a pretty embarrassing losing streak. But it's Rosetta's turn to compete and she's happy just dropping out of the first round to spare herself the humiliation. She ends up being paired with a newer garden fairy who is anxious to compete and aim for the gold.<br /><br />It's a really refreshing watch with the same Tinkerbell Pixie Hollow world and fantastic music but a new lead, and I think a lot of kids nowadays can relate to not wanting to compete in public, even when they do have a great chance at win. I knew plenty of kids when I was in school who would fail gym for lack of participation, simply because they were afraid of trying and failing. So this is a really great theme to share with little ones!<br /><br />I don't have much else to say but... If you buy this, here's a tip. Do watch the included music video The Great Divide by the McClain Sisters. Not because the song is great (it is, I like it), but because it is hilarious. One of the sisters, being a new up and comer of course (you'll know her when you see her, I promise), is not super awesome at controlling her facial expressions for the camera. Throughout the whole music video, she shoots you looks like a lion on the prowl about to jump on some fresh meat and it had melaughing with my daughter having no idea why.<br /><br />So don't be afraid to give Tinkerbell a shot with this one! Even my son loves the sense of adventure in every movie, especially this one. Definitely a must watch for siblings!laughing with my daughter having no idea why.<br /><br />So don't be afraid to give Tinkerbell a shot with this one!

B00LD1OHE0|5|Stunned again by the tapestry of fate, love, lies, pain, and redemption that Colleen Hoover weaves in the pages of yet another wonderful story. I think my favorite will always be Hopeless, because it was the first book of hers I read, but she's truly a genius in writing the most amazing YA novels which touch even the hearts of not-so-Y A's. Some of this plot was predictable, but some of it was not--at least for me. It was unique in that there are pictures of some of the paintings described. That's a fantastic addition to the story. In summary, it's a really good book, and I know I'll read it again one day. If you've liked Hoover's other work, you'll like this I'm sure. And if you haven't read her books, I do highly recommend them. I have never been disappointed in her stories. The only time I'm disappointed is when they're over & I still wish there was more.
B001KVZ6F2|5|This is a remarkable movie. --Richard T. Jameson, taken from the product review<br /><br />If you are Clint Eastwood, you can make a movie how it should be made. As grand, iconoclastic Dirty Harry, Eastwood stood up for those who would make America better and stronger. As Walt Kowalski, he fiercely faces down a neighborhood gang and rescues young Thao, brother of Sue, his sassy new Hmong friend and neighbor.<br /><br />This is the point where Eastwood becomes Walt--racist, mouth filled with racial epithets spilled forthrightly on the objects of his racism. But it is not a purposeful racism, just one of habit and habitat. As with any meaningful exchange with those different from us, he begins to see that the Hmongs are people--and Americans, as he is, but in a different cultural context. It is actually liberating for Walt to make this connection (he doesn't have one with his sons and their families).<br /><br />My first thought after seeing this movie was disappointment mixed with respect. \\"Gran Torino\\" did not produce the thrill I expected, but instead delivers compassion and redemption and sacrifice, inestimable values in the big picture of Life. Ol' Walt had more in common with the priest's boss than first meets the eye.<br /><br />I wondered why Eastwood specifically chose Hmongs to be his neighbors (were they initially scripted in?). Developing genuine concern, compassion, and finally affection for his neighbors, Walt shows how Archie Bunker could have been 20 years down the road of American cultural dynamics.<br /><br />This, I thought, was Eastwood's purpose. America is changing; let's acknowledge it, accept it, and embrace this change. How my heart swelled with respect and fondness for this new icon--a Walt embracing his own mortality by acceptance and finally redemption.<br /><br />This is a remarkable movie--<br />Judy Polhemus.
B00000J2KT|5|Full Metal Jacket is the gritty, psychologically disturbing tale of the process that turns humans into trained killers. The film is essentially diveded into two halves, with the first taking part during marine recruit  training where the would-be soldiers are molded into remorseless killing  machines. The performance by Vincent D'onofrio highlights this intense  first half. The second half follows Private Joker to Vietnam and the combat  of Hue City. Surprisingly, the violence of war pales in comparison to the  dehumanization process and build-up of the recruit training. Despite losing  some momentum(which would have been almost impossibe to keep up) it  completes the story by showing how the training has effected them mentally.  The combat scenes feature great cinematography among the backdrop of  countless     burning buildings. This is a welcome change from the scenery  of the jungle of most nam films. The end is cold, calculated and  surprising, culminating in an extrordinary experience. The film also  contains a unique feel to it, credited to director Stanley Kubrick. The  acting of Mathew Modine carries the film and the now infamous character of  Sg. Hartman make this an unforgetable film. Definitely worth the purchase  for the fact that it can be viewed many times because of its deep layers of  meaning. The Stanley Kubrick Colection also features the origional  cinematic trailer. In short, if you're looking for a film about vietnam  then skip this, but if you're looking for a film about the dehumanization  of war then this classic fits the bill. The film was nominated for best  adapted screenplay and was voted second best picture of the year by the  late critic Gene Siskel.
B00005MP58|5|Anybody who read or watched Pride &amp; Prejudice just once cannot forget the power of words! I am absolute fan of this book and DVD from the day I watched it on television. If you want to know how it feels to fall in love, this is how you can really learn!
B00G1YAD42|5|I like being able to choose which time zone clocks I want and being able to arrange them as I wish.  The night clock and alarm feature works very well for me.
B00009MGGI|5|This was a terrific political thriller with a lot going on.  Easy enough to follow though.  Ian Richardson did an incredible job!  It involves Ian Richardson playing the part of the Chief Whip in Parliment as he manipulates people and events to achieve his ultimate goal of becoming Prime Minister.  All three parts should be seen.  House of Cards, To Play the King and The Final Cut.
B00BSBR9N6|4|Our teacher book club recently read it.  For once we had a quick read that was humorous and educational.  Excellent way of educating the struggles and needs of the individual.  It also shows thoughtless, negative comments that could keep an individual from trying.  Over 25  years, I have interacted with my friend's child who has Asperger syndrome.  In order to teach the primary grades effectively, I needed to adapt to children's special needs i.e. hard of hearing, vision problems, Asperger syndrome, ADD, ADHD.  etc.  Simsion's book was very realistic.
B002W1HBN4|5|This Anniversary edition is simply amazing!  The songs sounds new and fresh, reminding us of Whitney's uncomparable vocals.  She has always brought feeling into songs that very few singers have been able to do, especially  the current pop and R&B singers.  All the songs have been remastered on this double disc edition, even the orchestration of The Greatest Love Of All has been changed from the originally released version.  Yet it sounds just as powerful and gorgeous!    As for the extras, her exquisite performance of I AM CHANGING from DREAMGIRLS, showcases her young and powerful talent.  Her first performance of HOME on the Merv Griffin show is also on this disc, however it was pre-released on her greatest hits dvd in 2000.  Finally, a live performance of YOU GIVE GOOD LOVE which is a vocal masterpiece.    Favorite track:    GREATEST LOVE OF ALL (Live at Radio City Music Hall, 1990)  - (I love this song live, her interpretation of the song, her delivery and her voice are perfection)    I RECOMMEND THIS FOR any music lover, young singer, Whitney fan, and anyone who really wants to know what singing is and what Whitney has contributed to the music industry and it's culture all over the world.
B005HED11Y|4|Well it is what we fans know but better quality. TNG is the better series but the original had its charm in spite of the low budget effects and corny sets.

B00005LASK|5|This album is Cat Stevens' masterpiece.<br />His lyrics are heartfelt. The music is engaging, catchy.<br />A wonderful tapestry of thought and emotion.<br />If you have ever thought that you liked any of Cat Stevens' songs<br />then you need to add this album to your collection.

There is so much to learn!<br />Renate Kellhammer

B00ESY7QXI|1|It was like watching a home movie from the 50's. The worst quality download from anywhere. Cable, Dish, Direct, Netflix. They all have Prime beat. Prime is not worth the money. If all you do with prime is order a bunch of books...maybe. Just don't get for the video. Not worth it.
B0034G4OYK|5|I enjoy this film. It is a good family film and I highly recommend it! Good family fun! Hilarious! Fun!
B0016CVN02|5|What can I say all of the old school hits in one place still sounds great with the volume cranked way up or is that because I'M OLD  and half deaf (damn stadium seating at the old concerts<br /><br />what can I say saw the Stones every time they came to the Spectrum in Philly and back then it only cost around 7 to 10 dollars they sound as good today as they did then this is an awesome collection
B009AMAJPA|3|I really liked this movie.  I drew me in...until the last 30 minutes.  It went from interesting to p-r-e-d-i-c-t-a-b-l-e.  Noomi Rapace was great in this.  Colin Farrell never looked hotter.  It was just so anti-climactic.  I expected a surprising finish maybe?  But I groaned out loud when I saw the way the movie was ending...  Then I pretty much went from 4 stars to &#34;it's okay.&#34;
B008EQIEWS|4|The movie was good and action packed. It doesn't take long for the action to get started. It was not as good as the first movie but it does not disappoint.
B0000024KQ|5|T put it in one statement: This is the rap equilvelent of \\"Anti Christ Superstar\\" by Marilyn Manson. Period. I LOVE this record!
B008L5G4I8|5|Styles proved to be one of the most memorable introductions in literary history. This book launched Christie's stellar career and birthed the creation of one of fiction's most indomitable characters; to wit, Hercule Poirot.<br /><br />IMHO, Styles still ranks  as one of the author's best works. Engrossing plot, characters and conclusion and a writing style that flourished for 50 years.<br /><br />And Christie had difficulty in securing a source to publish the effort originally!!  Go figure.
B008FSCNTK|2|I pretty much concur with what the others have said, but with the disclaimer that I only listened to the excerpts.<br />But the cover photo is nice.
B0085RQLXK|2|Aerosmith has been my favorite band since I was a teenager. They've had some fantastic songs, and they've had entire albums of stinkers (I'm looking at you, \\"Just Push Play\\").<br /><br />This is an album I just can't categorize. It's not completely terrible, but it's not very good, either. The only way I can describe it is that it's a schizophrenic mess. Sometimes it sounds like Aerosmith, sometimes it sounds like Def Leppard got Alzheimer's and tried to sing an Aerosmith song, and sometimes it sounds like Steven Tyler trying to sing Top-40 music, like something you'd hear on Kiss FM (the radio station).<br /><br />What do I mean? Well, this an album that sounds like Aerosmith... but sporadically. Some songs start out good, but then completely change in the middle of them - largely to their detriment. The album is overloaded with ballads, of which - and I am aware this is something of a minority opinion - only \\"What Could Have Been Love\\" is bearable to listen to more than once. It's nothing special, but it's a standard Aerosmith ballad like they've done at least dozen times before.<br /><br />The standout track on the album is \\"Street Jesus,\\" which sounds to me closest to their '70s rock, and it's the one song on the album that I've found myself listening to multiple times. Too bad they didn't think to make most of the album more like this one. While many folks found the 3 minute instrumental section at the end of \\"Out Go the Lights\\" unnecessary, I found it to be the only part of that song worth bothering with. You can get some 80s/90's Aerosmith rock flavor with the passable \\"Luv XXX\\" and \\"Oh Yeah,\\" which I'd liken to the Nine Lives/Get a Grip period sound. The dark-horse track is Joe Perry's \\"Freedom Fighter,\\" which is surprisingly enjoyable, although his voice is a bit weak. It's got kind of a Joe Perry Project / Done With Mirrors vibe to it.<br /><br />Any song from this album that I did NOT bother to mention in the previous two paragraphs is complete garbage.<br />\\"Beautiful\\" sounds like a rejected song from a Limp Bizkit and Britney Spears crossover... to call it music would be an insult to music. Legendary Child is self-indulgent tripe. The ballads are dull and uninspired. The second Joe Perry song, \\"Something,\\" is a train wreck.<br /><br />There's some nice guitar work here and there, even in some of the bad songs, but oh boy do you have to listen to a lot of awful noise if you want to actually hear most of it. The lyrics are pretty uninspired and cliched, even by Aerosmith standards.<br /><br />In conclusion, there are at best four and a half songs that won't make you want to rip your ears out (three and a half if you hate the radio single). It's not as awful as \\"Just Push Play\\" (but what else ever could be that bad?)... let's say it's a little better than \\"Nine Lives,\\" and not quite as good as \\"Get a Grip.\\"<br /><br />I'll give it a 2/5. If you're a fan sticking with them to the bitter end, sure, pick it up. If you're anyone else, most (though not all) of their albums are better.
B004DSX5B6|3|you get what you pay for. not great quality, won't last in tough use .
B005ZOBNOI|5|In the beginning of the book I wasn't exactly sure if I would like this book. But as Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters grew farther and farther in love, I became in love with the book. I just absolutely love the way John Green takes a serious matter and makes it have a sense of humor. I recommend this book highly.
1401301010|5|First off I want to say that several of the other reviews on here are misleading for all the wrong reasons. Obviously many of the other reviewers bought the book expecting to read all about the chili peppers, bad mistake on their part. If you wrote the story of your life would you talk all about your job, or would you talk about the experiences that made you who you are today. With that aside, the book is an amazing collection of all the things that Anthony has been through as an addict, punk, lover, fighter, survivor, friend and human. There are many detailed stories of sex, drugs, and rock n roll. Some might see this as repetitive but it is the life he has lived. If you truly are a red hot fan you will love the book as it gives insight as to where many songs came from, and the man behind the music. It is great to hear all the tales of a funky punk madman who helped create one of the best and most unique bands of all time. Bottom line if you are reading this you obviously like the band, so do yourself a favor get the book, read it with an open mind, and enjoy!!!
B0002CHIJW|1|Geez...Get over it people.  What is most offensive about this piece of trash if not the rape footage, but rather its ability to manipulate us into thinking this is important in any way.  It is badly done, strictly manipulative and in no way worthy of discussion (see, I am being ironic).  If you want to witness the true horror of rape, see Kubrick's 'Clockwork' or 'Better Days'.  C'mon--kitsch is kitsch and trash is trash and this definitely falls in the latter category.  This is offensive not because of its IQ-reducing and blatantly ludicrous aesthetic, but because it is still in the repetoire of horror films(??!!)  And the little critique from Cannes speaks volumes to the paucity of good films and postmodern French sensibilities in reviewing films.  Let this piece of crap die on the slaughterbench of history--please!!
030746363X|5|I just did my week 7 measurements yesterday,  I have lost 25.4 lbs and 28.25 inches.  It has really changed my life.  I hurt my back 5 years ago and exercise is hard, I can walk etc but I tried the Brazilian Butt Lift, Insanity and P90X and couldn't do any of them.  They all caused pain.  I tried another diet before this one and gained 7lbs.  I haven't even stuck to the diet as good as I could have been.  There were a few weeks in the beginning where I cheated more than just my cheat day.  Look at the results, and after only 7 weeks.  I am hooked!
0385484518|3|Of course, we should all give 5 stars, in this case, so as not to speak ill of the dead. It was that type of book. The author did a fine job, and I enjoyed much of the book on a PURELY emotional level. But that is the level  at which Morrie's life seemed to be stuck. Yet he pontificates the lessons  of life and death, HUMBLY for our absorption. I'm sure Morrie was a lovely  person to be around. But his quoted allusion by someone of him being a  &quot;prophet&quot; is a bit much for my tastes. He opted to avoid the real  world because his ideology, apparently, saw honest work as EXPLOITATION. So  he became a loveable &quot;clown&quot; in the ivory tower on Brandeis'  campus. He apparently had a common utopian dream that afflicts many campus  residents, but he never had to reconcile his own life with many of the  rigors of the &quot;real&quot; world. His life is brought down to the  basics of traditional emotions, in a life dominated by emotionalism. He  seemed very determined to &quot;win over&quot; everyone to loving him. He  struck me in the portrayal as entirely too needy, emotionally. The great  lessons seemed disappointing and trite, not profound. It left me wondering  like in the song, &quot;Is that all there is?&quot; Technically, and  classically, Morrie was no philosopher, but the sociologist he maybe always  was. I'm sure he would be a fine companion, ever trying to please and win  one over to his way of feeling. But profundity of thought about death, I  did not see in this thesis! IT would earn only a C, and not the easy A's  that Morrie gave out of compassion and social engineering. That's what  makes horse racing and the economy worth it's salt.
B00B8WXFWE|5|This is the New Kids On The Block album I was hoping for when they made their comeback! It is definitely some of the best output of their career. Strong, mature songs with fresh modern production. Definitely recommend this to all their fans and people who would enjoy a solid pop album. Lyrically I am also glad to see them tone down the raunchiness and select tracks that are fun, but also emotive with very tight vocals. It feels like they truly have matured this time around and don't have anything to prove. I just wish they had promoted it a little harder, as I feel many of these songs could have been bigger hits for sure. Certainly better than most of the pop music I hear on the radio these days!
0887307280|4|I listened to the audio version via Audible.com.<br /><br />Gerber tells us what's wrong with the way we run our small businesses and how we can do it better. He does so by telling the story of his consultation with a pie shop owner named Sarah. The lessons contained in the book are transformational, perhaps revolutionary, and I'm convinced they'll change my life and my business if I'm able to implement them. Very inspiring stuff and I've already recommended the book to at least a dozen people.<br /><br />My only problem is that the author makes the same mistake as many other popular business book writers by turning his story into a fable. Truth is, I don't really care about Sarah or her shop. I don't care about her aunt or the way he uses her to personalize the lessons and manufacture drama. I had the same reaction to books like[[ASIN:068815428X Gung Ho! Turn On the People in Any Organization]]! and [[ASIN:0688123163 Raving Fans: A Revolutionary Approach To Customer Service]]: the way the story is told sounds like the characters are fictional. Even if they're real, presenting them like fiction makes me question the validity of the information. Not a good thing.<br /><br />I'd much rather read a shorter book that cuts right to it. Gimme the good stuff straight up. When I want to read a good story, I'll dig into some fiction. In that respect, someone like Guy Kawasaki does it better than anyone else. Check out [[ASIN:088730995X Rules For Revolutionaries: The Capitalist Manifesto for Creating and Marketing New Products and Services]]. Succinct and powerful.<br /><br />Nonetheless, The E-Myth Revisited has some great info and is well worth the read.

0143119680|5|Discovery of Witches is a great story about two highly educated professors finding an old book and trying to find its meaning. Throwing the paranormal into the mix you have a very exciting tale. Diana is a witch, but since the death of her parents as a young child she has refused to embrace that lifestyle. No matter how much she pushes her witch skills aside it's very clear that her powers are special. When she is the only one who can open an important document it attracts all kinds of creatures. A very interested and sexy vampire, Matthew, who's an Oxford professor, witches, and daemons all start coming out of the woodwork to see what Diana does. These creatures live among us with careers and are aware of each other but the one cardinal rule is they don't mix with each other romantically. When Matthew brings it upon himself to protect Diana she quickly falls in love. The two can't be together because it's upsets the Congregation which is a council set up of vampires, witches, and daemons.<br /><br />I enjoyed the love story and became Team Matthew! Diana is very interesting because she's honest and straight forward. I love when they go to France to protect Diana from her own kind, the witches who are out to get her. I loved the castle they stay in, Matthew's mom, their servant, and the horses they ride. It was all magical and lovely.  The relationship between Matthew and Diana grow quickly. The Congregation comes to put a stop to their growing relationship and threatens the lives of those they love.<br /><br />Diana goes to spend time with her Aunts in New York to  better understand her kind. Her Aunt's house is alive and very temperamental with ghostly ancestors living there too. With some very exciting events the book ends with everyone having to go different ways. I look forward to finding out what happens in  book two, Shadow of Night, which will mix my two favorite genres, historical and paranormal. Deborah is an excellent writer and I think everyone who loves a good story will enjoy the series.a good story will enjoy the series.

B0002UXBD6|5|I went to Green Day's American Idiot concert in May 2005 in Peoria, IL, and man, I tell you I had a blast! These guys really sound good live on stage. The song \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\" sounded awesome when they played it live. At the concert, I was shocked to see so many kids there, ranging from six year olds to teenagers to no longer kids (mature folks). I'm forty, and I have a six year old son who loves the American Idiot album. When he's with me in the car, everytime I play the songs, \\"American Idiot\\" and the \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\", I tune out the parts where there's explicit words because, I just don't like to hear my six year old singing them with explicit words. He's too young for that. All in all I love the album. Wish Green Day has another version of American Idiot album without explicit lyrics so my son and I can enjoy it without tuning out the bad words for him.
B004SGWYW4|3|I watched HOTD in Japanese- so I can't speak for the dub, since I actually didn't by the DVD yet. This is a short series, and they oddly enough stamped it forty dollars? No way. The show is entertaining to watch on a rainy day, if you don't have anything better to watch. But, to spend that much on 12 episodes of a show with virtually NO story whatsoever and nothing but fanservice is like paying for a prostitute to stare at.<br /><br />Cliches out the ass. Every character has huge breasts and a butt that could be considered a rear bust. We get every sort of overused carbon copy stereotype that we can. Moe, super moe, super tsundere, loli, fat nerd otaku, the overly regular guy who turns out to be a badass, military chick and so on. It's nothing to write home about. The animation is decent, but it seems they put the most budget and effort into shading the female assets when they're constantly jamming them down your throat. Call me gay for saying there's too much fanservice... but there really is.<br /><br />I can't bash it for not having a story, since it's a zombie plot. Government shadiness, people dying, moral crisis, loss of innocence, it's all rather typical. So they don't gain points but they don't lose many either. Though you can call them unoriginal and dock points if you're critical like me.<br /><br />There's a carefree negligence the show makes blatantly obvious almost every scene. They all know that they could easily die and be doomed at any moment, but... nobody seems to care. I understand losing the will to live during the apocalypse, but they just blindly run into hordes of zombies like \\"LOLOL I HOPE I DUN GET BIT! DERP! CLOSE RANGE IS SMART WITH FLESH EATING INFECTED!\\" and it sort of pisses me off. Sure- it makes things 'fun' but at the same time makes it just lack just a bit more logic (though I know mentioning logic in a series about zombies is retarded).<br /><br />So- overall... if you want a new reason to look up images of certain characters and desire a blond haired nurse character who has breasts that might hit the floor if she were topless, look up High School of the Dead. It's not an amazing series, but there's a bit of fun bloodbrawling that makes you smirk and some nice bums and bewbs forced into every other scene. It's amazingly overpriced and I can only imagine that all the females have the most disgusting dubs ever- but give it a shot if you need something to keep you awake for a few hours.racter who has breasts that might hit the floor if she were topless, look up High School of the Dead.

B0049OSQ18|3|Okay, so this entire album sounds like The Decemberists stumbled upon a few tracks that Tom Petty wrote but decided weren't good enough.  The only track worth mentioning is Don't Carry it All, which is why the lyrics are printed on the inside of the album cover.  I am afraid to say this, but in my opinion, the Decemberists reached their peak with The Crane Wife (which is still one of my favourite albums) and are currently on the decline.  I hope to see them come back with something better than this album full of Tom Petty rejected tunes.
B009ZQC7MY|5|Still a riveting story.  The unexpected happens, but family love continues.<br />Awesome acting portrayed by all. Ready for the 4th season!
B003PJ6UHA|3|I find the concept of biocentrism to be compelling.  QM casts a really strange light onto the nature of reality, and consciousness obviously plays some role in things that happen \\"outside\\" of oneself.<br /><br />Some low reviews of this book were short and didn't (in my opinion) adequately explain what was wrong with the book, aside from just casting judgments at it.  As this is a controversial theory, I expected as much, which is why the wide range of reviews didn't necessarily put me off.  Some of the other low reviews are clearly from people who already know what they think.  Likewise some of the positive reviews I saw were pretty useless and/or gave into people's confirmation bias.<br /><br />I would like to believe that biocentrism is true.  I think there is some elegance to it, and the authors are certainly passionate about it.  The main issue that I had with it is that I was never fully satisfied that consciousness couldn't be disregarded by science (i.e. the status quo) as being just an effect of such a complicated makeup of the brain.  In other words, a skeptic could take the position that our subjective experience is simply an effect of the complexity of our brains and current inability to quantify it into something tangible.  I think that it's necessary for the authors to explain (and provide more evidence for) why consciousness is by itself the cornerstone of reality and not just a bag of complexity.  It seemed like more of an inductive proof of it being so than anything.  And that is not going to satisfy skeptics.  Like, I want evidence that demonstrates that consciousness can't be explained by physical processes.<br /><br />That aside, biocentrism does seem to explain concepts that the current state of theoretic physics can't get to, such as the GUT.  And I really, really liked the idea that anything bendable (e.g. space and time) isn't fundamental.  +1 for that.<br /><br />Is this theory worth further consideration and experimentation?  Absolutely.  Would I like to see more evidence and compelling arguments for some of the assertions made here?  Absolutely.
B00DF0POXA|2|The beats are adequate but don't build toward anything, thus resulting in a self-aggrandizing, hallow album. The tracks suffer mostly from Kanye's feeblest, most self-indulgent attempt as a rapper (I Am a God). The lazy lyrics on Yeezus will neither challenge nor impress anyone who has had sex more than once in their life, as Kanye drones on about this conquest or another, and how he has ultimately found his soulmate (presumably Kim Kardashian). Previous records by Kanye served plenty of ego (as all rap and hip hop artists do), but his earlier works were balanced out by lyrics that challenged social constructs. Skip it until it hits the $5 bin.
B007F5S1CM|5|I personally think this collection of their early live recordings sounds way better than their studio album versions. This is a must have for any Smith's fan!

B000VDDDY6|5|I grew up with the original Star Trek series in the 1970's as it became popular through syndication. I was a huge fan of the show and could name all of the episodes as well as tell you about each. Over the years, though, other interests replaced my enthusiasm for Star Trek, but now I have rediscovered the thrill of the original series through this remastered edition on DVD. The new special effects do not detract form the show at all. They are tastefully done and in a style that compliments the look and feel of the show. In my opinion they have improved the show and given the original Star Trek new life.    There have been some reviews that criticize the disks for not having labels on them. This is true, but there is a set of cards that come with each box that lists the contents of each disc, so I don't see an issue with not having a label printed on each disc itself.    Other reviews have stated concerns that the case this DVD collection comes in is flimsy. I have to let you know that I accidentally dropped the case full of it's entire contents, from a height of about 5 feet onto a carpeted surface and it wasn't damaged at all, so I think the packaging for these remastered sets is sturdier than some people may think.    I have thoroughly enjoyed this product and highly recommend it to anyone who wants to relive the magic of the original series.
B005S9ELVC|2|This is a violent, bloody R-rated territorial squabble set in the late 1940s between the Los Angeles Police Department and the Mickey Cohen/Bugsy Siegel East Coast Mob. This humor-laced (and bullet-ridden) outing pits East Coast gangsters against ...hmm... not really a Dirty Dozen, more like a Slightly Soiled Six-Pack, of cops who have been anonymously recruited to run organized crime out of Los Angeles.<br /><br />This is a highly fictionalized story inspired by real events. We see:<br />  * Sean Penn (\\"Milk\\") is Mickey Cohen, a former professional boxer with a nasty temper, brutal and merciless. I must say, Penn has become a caricature of himself....and he has NEVER learned to enunciate!<br />  * Nick Nolte (\\"Warrior\\") is Police Chief Parker, the guy determined to keep Cohen and his cohorts from setting up shop in LA.<br />  * Josh Brolin (\\"W.\\") is Sgt. John O'Mara, an Army vet, now a cop for the LAPD. He is hand-picked for the job, and he in turn hand picks his own squad (with some help from his wife).<br />  * Ryan Gosling (\\"Drive\\") is Sgt. Jerry Wooters, who first declines the \\"honor\\" of serving on the team, but then he gets mad... (with the Hollywoodland real estate development sign shining in the background.)<br />  * Emma Stone (\\"The Amazing Spider-Man\\") is Grace, a favorite of Cohen's; Sgt. Wooters likes her, too.... Vintage clothing looks good on this gal!<br />  * Robert Patrick (\\"Trouble With the Curve\\") is Max, otherwise known by this little gang as \\"Hopalong\\" because a six-gun is his weapon of choice.<br />  * Michael Peña (\\"End of Watch\\") is Navidad, who nominates himself to join up when Max is recruited.<br />  * Giovanni Ribisi (\\"Avatar\\") is Conway, a technician who is invited into the project because he understands telecommunications...and our geek accepts because he would like to be a hero to his son.<br />  * Anthony Mackie (\\"The Hurt Locker\\") is Coleman, the only law in his tough neighborhood. He just wants to stay OUT of Burbank!<br />  * Yvette Tucker (\\"Me Again\\") does a perfectly splendid turn as Carmen Miranda, complete with a towering headgear of fruit, singing at Slapsy Maxie's nightclub during a raid.<br /><br />This shoot-em-up is almost non-stop gunfire interspersed with blowie uppie stuff. There isn't as much profanity as usual, but the vehicular mayhem is sorta fun with those big old 40s vintage cars swaying and lurching around corners.<br /><br />Be sure to suspend disbelief, but be prepared to laugh more often than you might expect. Despite all the blood and gore, the screening audience was mildly entertained, and that's what it's all about, ...isn't it? ...Maybe? Amazon will notify me when this is available on DVD so I can notify my folks on JayFlix.net.
1400044162|4|It is not often that a novel comes to hand that has been prized, praised and pre-inflated. Half of a Yellow Sun was in that category when I opened it and began to read. And I was captivated immediately. I read the first hundred pages at a pace, delighting in the ease with which the Chimanada Ngozi Adichie used language to draw me into the middle-class clique centred on the University of Nsukka which provides the core characters of her book. Their infidelities, their inconsistencies, their desire, despite the servants, for equality and freedom are symptomatic of their time. The dissimilar twin sisters, Olanna and Kainene, one imagines will provide a vehicle for parallel and different lives, providing contrast and metaphor, and I eagerly awaited their stories to unfold.<br /><br />The book's sections alternate between the early and late 1960s, the latter period in Nigeria, of course, being the Biafran War. And, yes, the characters live through the war, and their lives and their natures, and along with them their country, are transformed by it. Perhaps even their own identity is redrawn, especially once the promise of a recognised nationality is promised and then denied. Eventually there are vivid scenes of the war's brutality, its double standards, its compromises, its cynicism, its racism and its starvation. The images are graphic and vivid, unforgettable even, and the ability of war to undermine utterly and profoundly any assumption that an individual might harbour about an imagined future is movingly portrayed.<br /><br />So why then was I so disappointed with the book? All I can offer, I'm afraid, is that eventually I found it shallow. Its apparent concentration on the domestic lives of the characters undermined their credibility as members of an intellectual elite and rendered them two (or perhaps even one) dimensional. Chimanada Ngozi Adichie carefully tells us that Odenigbo is a mathematician and in love with his subject. He covets his personal library, which he loses in the war and then has replaced by a benefactor. But in my experience, mathematicians are passionate people - and are usually passionate about mathematics. No mathematician I have ever met avoids all mention of personal academic interests in social settings as scrupulously as Odenigbo. I didn't want the novel to become a textbook, but if characters were ballet dancers, surely we would expect to hear of the roles they had danced and the music that had moved them. Of Odenigbo's academic character we hear nothing. Why is he therefore endowed with knowledge and interest that is never explored? Perhaps he only exists as a character to interact with the twin sisters.<br /><br />And the problem is repeated with Richard Churchill who, we are told is an Igbo-speaking English radical. I knew a lot of sixties radicals and they were never slow to offer an opinion or, indeed, place themselves squarely in a space on the ideological chessboard. In Half of a Yellow Sun, we never learn if Richard is a Marxist, Maoist, Leninist or Trot. He never mentions Castro or Ho Chi Minh. He doesn't appear to have any position on capitalism, society, business, the Third World, South Africa, Central America or even Viet Nam. I found myself wondering which sixties decade saw his radicalisation. When Chimanada Ngozi Adichie tells us that he travels to Lagos to attend a function in honour of the state funeral of Winston Churchill (perhaps no relation), I began to wonder if he was an early- (or indeed late) born radical Tory. I have been an expatriate myself, so I can forgive him his attendance of the function, but not his total silence on the issues of the day.<br /><br />This becomes especially problematic when both Britain and the Soviet Union are mentioned as assisting the Federal Forces in the destruction of secessionist Biafra. What sixties radical, given the inevitability of his assumption of a Cold War bifurcated paradigm to underpin his ideological position, would not have ponderedand discussed this at length, even in bed?<br /><br />Eventually we also have to read along with continued adulation of Ojukwu. His Excellency might even be the Great Helmsman, himself, given that his free-thinking minions seem unable to mention a criticism of an historical character who eventually fled to Ivory Coast to save his skin and live his life in relative comfort after leaving millions of his own people dead. Perhaps he had to be preserved to fight another day, as he eventually did, if in a different way, but surely no sixties radical would have left his role unquestioned. It doesn't ring true, and an opportunity to develop a character like Richard through his own and inevitable disillusion was ignored.<br /><br />And then we are presented with a pair of American journalists that the radical Richard has to greet and service in his role as a promoter of the Biafran cause. They are both called Charles and apparently have the same nickname, Chuck - which surely should have been Charlie of the \\"right\\" variety to enhance the farce. They are simply not credible. We can probably accept as deadly accurate that the majority of Americans neither knew where Biafra was nor cared a jot about its plight, since the attentions of the politicised were focused elsewhere at the time. But the presentation of a pair of foreign correspondents as crass as these is surely incredible, as is, equally, Richard's apparent patience in dealing with them.<br /><br />I did also become mildly annoyed at what became quite extensive use of Igbo words when they seemed to offer no extra flavour, meaning or understanding. I have no problem with the use of local terms to enhance a feeling of place and sound, but their over use tends to obfuscate. We really wanted to know what these people thought, but we were never told.<br /><br />So what are we left with? Half of a Yellow Sun is a beautifully written, beautifully composed domestic tale of fidelity, infidelity, loyalty and opportunism. The contrast between the characters' and therefore the nation's lives at the start and the end of the decade is engaging. But because their psyches are never really explored, we never understand any motives or, therefore, any consequences. Reading Half of a Yellow Sun was a thoroughly enjoyable experience which, with hindsight, I would have foregone.ven in bed?

B000V4UFZK|5|The Freelings live in Cuesta Verde, a planned community created by Steve's company. Diane is a housewife who takes care of her children Dana, Robbie, and Carol Anne. One day, objects just start moving by themselves in the family's kitchen. The family is delighted at first until a tree tries to kill their son and their daughter is missing. The Freelings employ the help of parapsychologists to get their daughter back. Who are these spirits and why do they want Carol Anne?<br /><br />Poltergeist is the haunted house movie that I measure all others against. Very few have reached even close to its achievement, so I'm not a huge fan of most of them. Poltergeist, although made in 1982, isn't as predictable and steeped in tropes as many much newer films like The Conjuring or Insidious. So many of the scares come from out of nowhere: the tree almost eating the little boy, the face scene, and the ending (including that creepy clown and the spreading of the haunting to the entire neighborhood). The suspense is expertly sustained throughout the film and actually has occasional significant scares to justify the high suspense level (again, unlike many recent films). The practical effects have held up well over the years. So many moments are equally creepy to child me and adult me. I still can't believe the film is rated PG because I had so many nightmares as a kid and it is still a very memorable and scary film.<br /><br />One of the main strengths of the film is the family. They have to be sympathetic or the plot just wouldn't work. The beginning establishes them as a normal, everyday family. They disagree and fight, but ultimately love each other. The happenings at the beginning start out as fun family events. Chairs and children are slid across the floor by some unseen force and it's all fun and games until Carol Anne, the angelic looking 5 year old, goes missing. The family stays united even as they mourn for their lost member. Their pain is poignant and the viewer can't helpbut feel for them. The scene where the parapsychologists first come to the house is perfectly performed. The family hears Carol Anne running from something and she ends up running through her mother, who breaks down with emotion because it's the first physical contact she's had since her child has been gone. JoBeth Williams is amazing and I can't watch the scene without crying. Heather O'Rourke isn't the best child actor, but her delivery of the line &#34;They're here&#34; will live on in horror movie history forever. Craig T. Nelson as Steve is more skeptical than his wife, but no less caring about his daughter. I like that Poltergeist takes the time to get to know the family because if we don't care about them, the film falls flat.<br /><br />The ending is wholly unexpected. After rescuing Carol Anne, the house should be clean, but the spirits return with a vengeance, exposing the dead buried under the neighborhood. It's just another example of a corporation making shortcuts in their business and allowing the public to face the repercussions while they reap the profits. The company was surveying another cemetery earlier in the film, showing active planning to build another community without moving the dead. This theme has been in film for a long time and is still quite relevant today.<br /><br />Poltergeist is the perfect haunted house film. It avoids a lot of common tropes and proves to stand the test of time. I was on the edge of my seat the entire film and it felt that anything could happen at any time. I love this movie and will definitely revisit it for years to come.
B00AA0TJO8|2|Can't play, opens then after a few seconds closes, can't even begin to play, Samsung Galaxy S4, so shouldn't be problem running the app!
B005LAIIKI|5|First off let me start by saying there shouldn't be any sort of hesitation when considering to add this to your Bluray collection. Tarantino does it again. One of the best films if not the best of last year. There's a beautiful balance here that isn't quite found in movies as of late. Violence, Humor and Great Writing. Tarantino puts together a visual masterpiece and at $13.00 dollars this movie is a steal!
B007T99ENE|3|McEwan is a great writer. This novel is certainly an entertaining read but not up there with other McEwan novels. The twist at the end (which I am not going to give away) is reminiscent of how he ended Atonement - a far superior novel.
B004T5R2HQ|5|Great app! Got it for free and am glad I did not pass it up! Scans receipts perfectly, which I then send to my docs app.
B004X6PRO6|5|Emotional, creative and thought provoking novel that immerses the reader into all that might be wrong with being born a citizen of North Korea.  Time well spent.  Word of warning, this book is intended to make the reader feel the main characters pain.  This book did not leave me feeling warm and fuzzy.
B00005K9LK|3|I became a huge fan of Judas Priest since I first heard Unleashed in the East in 1979. The Priest was building enormeous momentum in the late '70s, especially by opening to Kiss and more often than not, stealing the show with their raw power and energetic brand of heavy metal. Judas Priest's music was fresh and their attitude made them the new underdog favorites of the new heavy metal scene. Rob Halford's voice and presence ruled the stage.<br />By 1980, the Priest finally made it relatively big with British Steel. Released in 1982, Screaming for Vengeance emerged with fury after a lukewarm release (Point of Entry). Screaming for Vengenace has plenty of catchy metal riffs, which blended perfectly with Rob Halford's thunderous voice.<br />However, Screaming for Vengeance's purpose was solely to gain commercial success, and they achieved it. This is one of the better liked productions of the band (as other reviewers have attested). But to me, the majority of the songs in Screaming for Vengeance lack creativity, musicality and power. Also, Rob's lyrical mystique was gone here. Glenn and KK's guitars are very good as usual, although a bit constrained compared to earlier releases. Ian Hill's bass is almost unnoticeable. It also didn't help that the drums are so boring and tepid here. Ex-Trapeze drummer Dave Holland only uses the hi-hat closed in every single song... After the third song I get tired of the same sound over and over. He never bothered to open the hi-hat or to use the ride cymbal at all. Although he had double bass drums, he rarely played them. Sorry, but Judas Priest's music should be played with a fiery drummer. I don't think Holland was even able to play older gems like Exciter or Here Comes The Priest. It was simply impossible for him technically, and this translated to the &quot;just decent&quot; quality of Judas Priest's music circa 1982. If you have never heard the Priest, just listen to any album they released prior to 1980 (with Les Binks and/or Simon Phillips on drums), or to Painkiller in 1990, with Scott Travis bashing the skins. Not a bad album, but not nearly the best from the mighty Priest!imon Phillips on drums), or to Painkiller in 1990, with Scott Travis bashing the skins. Not a bad album, but not nearly the best from the mighty Priest!

B0090P98Z4|3|Great game and amazing graphics but the in game purchases are a little pricy and you need glu credits go get some items like rage positions plays you start out with barly any credits but it has great game play ant graphics u<br />You even get to slay dragons just glu has to be glu has to get its prices cheaper
B00004SCX6|2|Well even thought I think this second cd sounds alot like the first one, its an okay CD if you are just a die hard Britney fan. Here's my adivce to  Ms.Spears........Britney you are a talented dancer and a very strong and  beautiful young lady.Why don't you try acting or modeling because I really  do feel that singing is not your thing.
0060853972|5|I wish I was witty enough (and British enough) to have written this book. It is an amazing and hilarious literary feat. Gaiman and Pratchett vividly describe every character and scene; Crowley and Aziraphale are one of the most entertaining duos to grace the pages of fiction and if you disagree you should stop reading this review and call a doctor - you've obviously suffered severe brain damage and need to seek medical help immediately.
0446608955|5|A Walk To Remember was a great book to read I really enjoyed it. But I did think that it was a little boring at the beginning. For about the first one or two chapters it was just basically describing everyone and everything and it just got a little hard to keep reading, but I got through it and when I read the rest of the book I was amazed. I thought it was a awesome story with great plot twists and a great ending. I'm not going to tell you what happens in the end, but I can say that it was happy, and sad at the same time. But I think that it is a very, very good book to read and espcially if you are a person who enjoys reading romance novels. Well, I overall I really liked this book, and there were really no real bad points in the book that I disliked, other than the beginning. The book was a little different from the movie. I will say that I liked the movie a little better because I think that it was somewhat easier to follow. So I think that people should defenetly read this book, it was great and god bless!!!
B0001NBMBC|5|Volume3 The Subliminal Verses is a Fantastic Album. I listen to it a lot. Every song is great. My favorites are Vermilion, Duality,The Virus of Life and Welcome. I think this is their best album!!!

B000AHJJDM|5|I'm a Death Cab fan no doubt, and although this album has a more &#34;pop&#34; sound than any of their previous albums, I really like it.  The album is simple and serene.  The emphasis of the songs is honed in on Ben Gibbard's vocals, which as always are crisp.  I would say the sound of the album is more &#34;open&#34; than their other LP's, which leaves you with some contemplative lyrics, warm vocals, and soft strings and piano that creates a very peaceful, slightly melancholy atmosphere.  I have to say I love the album artwork, it fits right in with the music.  The vinyl is 180 gram and 2 LP's which is great!  The D side contains only one track, the bonus track, which leaves a lot of empty space on that side, but the more LP's the merrier right?
B0044DEAUA|5|works great, purchase one unit, liked it so much, purchase other one for the wife's car, would purchase again, great product

B000M4RG42|2|I love WWII movies and was looking forward to Flags of our Fathers on DVD.  I was especially hoping it would include commentaries by a war historian and veterans of the battle. The DVD came out today, but I did not buy it.  I didn't see one tiny extra listed on the back.  Since the DVD is so plain, there has to be a \\"Director's Cut\\" or \\"Special Edition\\" coming out in the near future.  Like an earlier reviewer put it, I am tired of buying a disc only to have a more extensive copy come out a little later.  I didn't see the movie in the theater, but I will be patient for a change and wait for the more extensive version that is sure to come.    Like I said, I have not seen the movie, therefore, the 2 stars are only for the bare bones disc.    pk

I believe it....she's glued to my Kindle everytime I see her anymore.  But, it gives me great pleasure to see her happy.  By the way, I had seen some shows on Downton Abbey and I thoroughly enjoyed them.  As for the series on Kindle...they're coming in great.  It gives Nancy time for rest from her workday.  For that, I am grateful.  Thanks Amazon.  Great idea!
B000001GH9|5|Sometimes it takes going to a live performance of a work that is familiar to you on recording to make you revisit an old friend with renewed passion.  So it was after hearing the astonishingly fine young violinist Jennifer Frautschi collaborate with Pierre Boulez and the Los Angeles Philharmonic in the Berg Viloin Concerto that I returned to this brilliant recording of the Berg with Anne-Sophie Mutter, James Levine, and the Chicago Symphony to revive those moments.  And once again this recording seems definitive.  Berg's Requiem work is knowingly and lovingly performed with a richness of tone and technique that erases all of the seeming hurdles of atonal writing and delivers a wrenchingly passionate farewell work. The other joy of this particular recording is the coupling of Wolfgang Rihm's &quot;Time Chant&quot; which he wrote for violinist Mutter.  This lyrically transcendent piece is evocative of the best of Messian and more than any other violin work to my knowledge succeeds in creating the illusion that the violin is a human voice, singing over a murmuring, pensive orchestral obbligato.  Mutter masters this and the result is hair-raisingly beautiful.  This is a very solid and very beautiful recording - and one that even the most harsh critic of atonal and contemporary music will succomb to in time.
