0307951529|5.0|This book, the second in Chris' collection of inspiring books about living the life you were meant to, is one book that you shouldn't go the entire year without reading. In fact, if you haven't already bought a copy and started reading it, you're missing out! I'm confident that in 2-3 years and beyond, legions of people will be citing Chris Guillebeau as being a major influence upon their life and one of the biggest reasons for their success.

0062082353|5.0|There was not one slow moment in this book.<br /><br />American Sniper made me gasp out loud.  It made me cry.  It made me laugh.  It made me feel proud to be an American.  It made me feel overwhelmed and completely appreciative of all the people who have served and continue to serve our country.<br /><br />This is the first book I have read of this genre.  I enjoyed it immensely and more importantly... I want to learn more.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I love this game. Lots of levels and hours of entertainment.  Its fun to figure out ways to get all the stars on each level.
B005AUWY90|4.0|There are very few animated sequels better than the original, and all of them are by Pixar.  This film is the latest entry in the Pixar franchise, and follows up a little while after where the first film left off.  This time set in multiple locations around the world, Cars 2 moves at a faster pace than its predecessor, with more action, comedy and a more intricate plot.  Whereas the first film followed the traditional Pixar line of a movie about a character's emotional growth, this film is more like standard Hollywood fare of a big budget action-comedy, except tailored for all ages.  As to this package, the Blu-Ray and DVD both come with the famous Pixar short, along with a small extra featuring Mater.  There is also a preview of Pixar's next release, Planes, which seems to be an offshoot from the Cars' franchise.  All told, a great buy.
B0086700CM|5.0|I LOVE temple run. It is one of the most addicting game ever! Deffinitly worth waiting for. But I really wish that they would keep their word of when they're gonna release the game.
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple run is such an awesome game It is so addicting wants you start and I think it is just so great to play:)
B002PMPTIO|5.0|I hadn't even watched this until just now not even when it came out, but I always heard it was good. Of course it has it's fair share of critics, but even though I am a big Classic Trek fan, I knew I would still like this. But finally watching it it blew my exceptions out the water. It was terrific! I never expected it to be not only full of really thoughtful moments but really funny and whimsical too. It has a great sense of wonder about it. It never takes itself too too seriously, but it keeps that intensity and tight action too.<br /><br />I loved the performances of everyone as the classic characters. But what really stood out was, Chris Pine really fit the role quite well as Kirk and he added something new but I could still see a little tiny bit of Shatner mannerisms in there...I don't know if that's just me or not, but it was great. Really good job. Karl Urban as Bones McCoy, where to start! He channeled McCoy perfectly! He was funny, snarky, and had a great dynamic with Pine's Kirk. Simon Pegg as Scotty, awesome. Also Zac Quinto! Awesome! It was a little strange at first seeing him as Spock when your'e so used to watching Leonard Nemoy, but that goes away pretty quickly. He also added so much more to Spock with his own way of performing the role, with the way he carried himself, and said things. He really knew how to play a guy who was fighting to control his strong emotions and kind of failing. Also he had this awesome swagger about him and he was just so fresh with it. Really loved his Spock a lot. And of course Leonard Nemoy was amazing. It was so good to see him as future Spock, and it was really nice to see that the filmmakers wanted to honor the history of Kirk and Spock's friendship and what it means to all of us. Nimoy's scenes were breathtaking and touching.<br /><br />Everyone did their part, and everyone was great. The music too, I loved the music. Very souring, but not overpowering, and it pulls you right in.<br /><br />In short, I loved this movie. I would recommend it to anyone and for those not really that sure about a lot of adaptations, I would say give this one a chance. It pays great respect to the original, while also standing well on it's own and in it's own right. And you just might appreciate a new look at all the characters you love.
B007SGM084|1.0|The box set in paperback is due to release in a few days and amazon is charging 28.99 for them.  How does it make sense that the kindle version is 29.99 for the set of 3?!?!  This is outrageous!  There are no printing, shipping, stocking costs.  I feel that paying only $0.50 less on avarage for a digital coy of a book is a rip off, however this REALLY IS A RIPOFF!  The paperback books are being printed, packaged, and shipped and are still cheaper than something that is sent digitally to the buyers-that is crazy!  Amazon really needs to take a harder look at their pricing for kindle books!
B0085TJUGI|5.0|This book has been absolutely life changing for me. Having lost someone near and dear to me in the last few weeks, I found this book both healing and comforting. It is a captivating and fast read one who's teachings will be with me always.
B002G1YPH0|4.0|I'm using this fan on an Intel Core i5 3570k Ivy Bridge proc with Arctic Silver 5 paste.  I ran the proc with 100% load on all four cores for several hours and the temperature barely went above 50c.  I haven't had a chance to OC the proc and rerun the test yet, but I think it's safe to say I'll be able to OC the proc a good amount, thanks to this fan.<br />Other reviewers have stated how large this thing is and I completely agree.  If you are installing the fan with a Rosewill Blackhawk case, you will need to uninstall the side-mounted fan from the side of the case.  There's barely not enough room, so you may be able to get by with installing a thinner fan.  Also, if you are using the Gigabyte GA-Z77X-D3H motherboard, just a heads up that the fan and/or heatsink covers the RAM slot closest to the CPU in all but one configuration.  I've found the only configuration that allows unrestricted access to that slot is to install the fan such that it faces the rear of the case.  I docked this fan a star because I had to remove the fan at one point and the screws which hold down the heatsink would not separate from the screws holding the mounting bracket in place.  As a result, the mounting bracket came off.  Re-installing a mounting bracket and that big heatsink with thermal paste on its surface at the same time was a total pain, even with another person holding the bracket in place!  Basically make sure the fan is set up how you want it and don't remove it unless you plan to replace it!
B007ZRZF8I|5.0|Fast pace awesomeness. Works great on optimus v. Wish i had a bigger screen to pay it on. Go gravity guy!
0553801481|5.0|Hobb's prose abounds with both emotional gravity and philosophical nuance, but this appreciation is acquired more completely by readers who are willing to invest in an active reading process of reflection upon her sententiae. This book stirred my soul, as have the other Farseer books. If you enjoy Hobb as an author, you can expect and anticipate nothing but her best from this work.<br /><br />Note: This book is, in essence, what I would call The Farseer Series (Book 4) insofar as it as a continuation on the Farseer Trilogy proper (Assassin's Apprentice, Assasin's Quest, and Royal Assassin). I would highly recommend reading the preceding trilogy first, since these stories place a heavy emphasis on the relationships and trials of the characters as it relates to one FitzChivalry Farseer.
B005LAIHPE|2.0|Street guy (though stylized), underacheiver, with successful older Brother, is convinced to join the Navy...grow up...do the right thing.<br /><br />His final statement as disheveled barfly is to break into a convenience store to steal a barrito (?) for the shockingly beautiful daughter of a Navy Commander..who decides to enter a neighborhood dive for said treat...too late...bar tender can't open the freezer door and look for the microwave. (typical government worker - jk). Then the tribute to Cable TV's \\"World's Dumbest CRiminals\\"...a mock-video surveillance tape where the dude falls violently from the rafters but accomplishes his mission. Actually a well-crafted and hilarious scene.<br /><br />His next screw up is to approach a UFO sitting out there off the coast of Hawaii..he bangs on the outside of the thing...then the fireworks. Is it..the end of the world?<br /><br />Thus, he gains confidence and knowledge (too bad he gets his Brother blown up in the fallout from his  \\"curiosity\\"). But this endears him to his \\"love interest\\"...who, by the way, not just a shocking blonde beauty but a physical therapist who works miracles for everyone she meets.<br /><br />Will our hero save the planet *and* get engaged to her?<br /><br />Just short of three stars. Special effects: phenomenal. Acting: pretty good.<br /><br />[Review based upon Theatre viewing].
1400052181|3.0|I want to give this book four stars simply because the story is compelling, but I really found that the subject matter got convoluted as the book went on. What started out being a book about the woman behind the cells used in countless scientific discoveries became an overly detailed and somewhat tedious account of her family's irrational fears and overreactions. I understand that most of their bizarre fears and emotional reactions to the news of their mother's surviving cells were due to their lack of education and understanding, but although I reminded myself over and over again of this I just felt that it bogged down the story. The fact is that keeping tissue samples from patients was (and still is, in many cases) common practice and there was very little if any deception intended by the original scientists, yet a solid half of the book is spent hashing and rehashing the family's anger and irrational fear.<br /><br />I enjoyed the parts about science and about how the cells were unique, providing a medium for experimentation that has yet to be matched, and I was interested to learn about the woman behind them and how their use affected her family. I just didn't expect the excessive level of self-inflicted drama that would be described in every painful detail. Whether the portrayal of the family as irrational and seemingly unteachable was the fault of Skloot or whether it was accurate, I just had trouble getting into the book or feeling much sympathy. If fact, the sentiment I felt most often while reading the second half of the book was \\"stop talking about Deborah freaking out so that we can hear more about Henrietta!\\"<br /><br />I agree with others who said that the Afterword could have been integrated into the second half of the book very effectively, and that doing so would have provided much needed focus for the writing.<br /><br />I recommend this book because the story is interesting and the underlying ethics questions are ones that we should all be aware of, but I would have liked more depth in the analyzation, more about Henrietta, and less meandering detail about each character.
B0018QQQK8|3.0|typical Nicholas Sparks book. It was cute and drew you in until the end fell a little flat. Did I like it? Yes. Would I recommend it to someone else? Sure-- what it the best book I ever read? No.
B004LROUNG|5.0|I very rarely feel that a book truly deserves a five star review, but this one sure does! The Litigators reminded me of Grisham's earlier works, as some other reviewers have also mentioned. It hooked me from the first page and it was on my mind whenever I didn't have it in my hand. The plot was exciting, the characters felt real, and the story never lagged for a minute. I just wish I hadn't read it yet so I could read it for the first time all over again.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I can't believe how easy this app is to use on my Transformer Prime. My only issue is I can't create collections so that I can store the books I have read, in a folder, while allowing the ones I haven't read to be out in the open. But other than that, I have no complaints.<br /><br />edited to add:  I have found that I can delete the books off of my tablet and they remain in my Kindle acct @Amazon.  So while I still can't put them in collections, I can remove them without losing them forever.<br /><br />This app would be also be better if the sorter worked better. I find that some of my books appear under the \\"Most Recent\\" not in the order that I bought them. This creates an issue with me as I have a lot of books downloaded and would like to read the oldest ones first. Sometimes the newest ones I bought down at the bottom where the oldest ones are located. I also notices that if I update the books because of the author correcting errors, that the book then appears at the top where my newest books are located. The original buy date should be used for sorting by most recent.
B0086700CM|3.0|The game is fun and addicting, but the family and I cannot turn for some reason... I gave it three stars for concept, creativity, graphics, and the way it is able to grasp and hold the consumer's attention.

B002QGUFWE|5.0|The un-censored single CD version is now available on Amazon.de - look for the 8 track copy with the red sticker - release date October 2010. Just as well considering you still can't download this version on UK iTunes like you can in other countries. I was really pleased when it turned up as, like everyone else has said, the censoring is extremely annoying and not really needed. Thanks to Amazon worldwide for being able to get this version.

B007JM4CWY|3.0|I have seen much better implementations of this game, but it is fun. I wouldn't pay 2.49 for it. I spend more time correcting misplaced boxes than I do playing. It is inaccurate. Also, shading every other line would be a huge help. It is fairly frustrating in its current state, especially at high levels.

B007ZRZF8I|1.0|I thought about this and one day saw it was free, so I got it. Then I deleted it. Why? It shares personal info without telling you through openfeint. I also couldn't find out how to shut off openfeint.

B005V2EVBQ|3.0|When I first got the kindle fire, I wanted to have a little bulk to it, especially if I dropped it, or didn't want to hold it. So I decided to start off with this case. It has a groove where you can fold the cover, but its only for horizontal positioning. It would be nice if it had a vertical groove, but then it may be too top heavy. It arrived in environmentally friendly packing, which is a plus in my book.
B00846REIS|5.0|Eva Tramell is adjusting to her new life in New York City and she's ready to start her new job.  She never counted on the first day of that job changing her life forever.  As her eyes meet those of multimillionaire Gideon Cross she loses more than her train of thought.  The intensity of his gaze stalks her thoughts even as she tries to avoid him but Gideon is not one to be denied and he has set his sights on Eva.  However, these two harbor painful pasts.  Can Eva and Gideon overcome the past to find forever in each other's arms?<br /><br />Sylvia Day rips open the human psyche in Bared to You.  Bared to You obliterates the competition with its real, emotionally intense characters that deal with pain and pleasure with honesty.  I felt these characters bare their hearts and souls in this story.  Sometimes it was so intense it was painful to watch as they hurt themselves and each other with actions or words.  Yet, this is what makes the story unique and unforgettable.  I became so attached to Eva and Gideon that I actually hurt for them.  I shared their pain and their joy as they fought to keep each other.<br /><br />While Eva might come off as moody, oversensitive or even bitchy, she is real.  I have seen this woman on the streets, been friends with her and even shared her irrationality at times.  Relationships make us different, we do things we would never admit to and overreact, and sometimes run.  I felt Eva's pain as she struggles with the past that gave her insecurities and the happiness she so wants to hold one to.<br /><br />Gideon also struggles with the past he doesn't want to confront.  Gideon is thrown by the powerful feelings Eva inspires.  He is used to calling the shots and taking charge but when this woman walks into his life he is thrown for a loop.  As he struggles to regain composure and hang on to his woman he realizes he may have to dig deep if their relationship is to last longer than the scorching sex.<br /><br />I couldn't get enough of their open, honest communication.  Eva and Gideon work for every second of pleasure and happiness in Bared to You.  And believe me there is plenty of pleasure as Ms. Day's characters send the mercury rising in Bared to You! I am anxious to see what happens next for these two characters that I have come to actually love.  I am also equally interested in Eva's best friend Cary.  I know the story there will be difficult to read but I want to this man find his happily ever after!  Get ready for an emotional whirlwind as you flip the pages of Bared to You and be prepared to enjoy every second!<br /><br />Reviewed by Miranda<br />For Joyfully Revieweden, honest communication.

B007ZRZF8I|4.0|It's simple. It's fun. Nothing earth-shattering, but it&quot;s good for a distraction. Play it if you liked Jetpack Joyride. Or not.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|ice age village is ok. I don't think its that interesting.you should try pet shop story or bird land or fluff friends rescue.
0060526491|5.0|As a fan of the ridiculous, I absolutely love the Burton poems.  The poems contain bizarre characters that are strangely loveable with their own unique circumstances and problems.  In only a few lines, you find yourself sympathizing with the characters, then being curiously okay with it when they inevitably meet their doom.  I loved it, and I think anyone who enjoys Tim Burton films purely out of their inherent weirdness will appreciate the ironic and sarcastic humor in this short collection.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it is an okay game to waste time but idk it kinda sucks I like to play it when I have nothing to do
0439023491|3.0|I read the whole trilogy and thoroughly enjoyed the books as a whole, but Catching Fire seemed like a placeholder between the action contained in The Hunger Games and Mockingjay.  The plot seemed unoriginal (mostly because it's largely the same as the first book) and Katniss comes across as more irritating than romantic.  Still has lots of the positive elements of the first book.  Just required reading to fill the gap.
B0086700CM|5.0|I like this game a lot.  I have it on my phone and kindle and play it all the time after the kids go to bed.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|The game is quite fun. It is very much like Super Mario Bros.  The only that is really different that I have noticed is Pep can't duck or go down trees.
B000X5SPBI|5.0|This show is funny and has suspense and is one of my favorites, I watch it all the time. It is a great show and has some comedy to keep the show from beging too serious. The shipping was fast and the seller wrapped it very good. The DVDs plays great and to this day, works great, it came in its original casing and they looked new and played very well, no skipping or scratches. The price was great. I recommend this seller and would buy from again.
0345803485|1.0|So I bought this a few months ago, before all the hype started, based on a friend's recommendation.  I didn't make it past page three.  I questioned my friend's sanity.  Then I forgot all about it. (Ah, those were the good old days.  The pre-FSOG days.)<br /><br />But someone unfortunately chose the book for my book club, so I sighed audibly, started it again, and spent the next few days torturing myself.  The writing was so unbearably awful that I was growing despondent (I actually had to up my prozac intake).  I would've quit part way through, but I wanted to finish the book in order to REALLY be able to critique it.  And, having finished it, I've made it my personal mission to tell others to save their time and money.  Seriously.  I live in a neighborhood where tons of people walk by and I am PUTTING A SIGN IN MY FRONT YARD TO WARN PEOPLE.  If I can save just one person from this horrible fate, I will feel like my life was worthwhile.<br /><br />The other 1-star reviewers have done a bang-up job of describing the shortcomings of this novel, so I will just let you know that my own personal hell was any time Ana referred to her 'inner goddess.'  By the time I got to the end I wanted to beat the goddess to death with a crowbar.
B002VKE1K2|5.0|This movie scared me, but I love it, watched it a few times, but it is so scary I dont watch it often. The shipping was fast and the seller wrapped it very good.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game. I am trying to get a baby to play with me. I don't think he likes me!!
B005L38QK2|5.0|Before this mouse all I bought was Razer mouses and keyboards,  never really noticed SteelSeries until Diablo 3 came out and wanted a D3 mouse.  I can tell you I don't plan on buying any more Razer products, they are good don't get me wrong but SteelSeries are superior compared to them.  I've had small problems here and there every now and then with pretty much all my Razer mouses, SteelSeries has had no problems \\"yet\\".  Well build and reliable so unless something goes wrong in the next year, i'll be buying again from them.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|The only reason I finished the book was to, incidentally, write a terrible review on it to save the rest of the poor souls who get sucked into this HEINOUS fad of repetitive, juvenile \\"mommy porn\\".

0345803485|5.0|When I first read the bad reviews here I was debating if I should even read it and waste my money. But I wanted to know what all the fuss is about it's a bestseller so I spent my money and bought it. Some reviews about this book has been bad but that's their opinion because I'm so drawn and obsessed to this book! I read it right when I got it and I finished it in 24 hours and that's a new record for me. I usually have a hard time finishing a book not this book. I could not put it down I even refused to eat dinner just so I won't stop reading this book. Christian Grey is mysterious and dark but I'm fell for him and Ana Steele is as naive as any girl can be once they meet a gorgeous, wealthy man with this kind of lifestyle.<br /><br />I give this book all the stars it deserves. I agree to some reviews that there are sentences and words  that were repetitive but to me this book deserves a good review. Cannot wait to receive book two because I can't go on one more day not reading what's gonna happen to Ana and will smooth talking Christian Grey be able to win her back?<br /><br />I'm fifty shades obsessed and I'm going to finish this trilogy.<br />:)
B007R3AZNK|4.0|I pre-ordered \\"Driving Towards the Daylight\\" months ago and received the day it came out (thanks Amazon!), but I wanted to live with it for awhile before writing my review. I'm such a big fan of Joe's work that I wanted my giddy first impressions of the disc to mellow before I passed judgement on it.<br /><br />Verdict: very good. Not his best -- for my money, that's \\"The Ballad of John Henry\\" and \\"Dust Bowl\\" -- but definitely something you'll want in your music library.<br /><br />Joe goes back to his blues roots on this disc; it follows the usual Bonamassa recipe of mostly covers with a few originals thrown in. This is a solid blues-rock album with little of the experimentation you saw on e.g. \\"Black Rock\\" (no bouzoukis!). It is in my opinion a step down from his previous \\"Dust Bowl\\", mainly because it feels more understated, but that's personal taste talking. I like a \\"purer\\" blues sound to a more pop-oriented one (which is why I've always preferred JB to John Mayer). Joe's guitar-work is stellar as always, and most of the tracks are keepers.<br /><br />Joe's originals on this track are all good, and show his growth as a songwriter.<br /><br />\\"Dislocated Boy\\" is perhaps the most biographical song on this album, and it's testament to the conflicts and dislocation any road musician feels (especially one who spends as much time on the road as Joe does). It's also a good old blues-rock rave-up.<br /><br />The title track is perhaps his most radio-friendly to date, and I mean that in a good way: it's a great song that may appeal even to people who aren't blues-rock aficionados. Joe's vocals have improved by leaps and bounds in recent years, and \\"Driving Towards the Daylight\\" puts his voice front and center -- his guitar still sings, but his vocals drive the song.<br /><br />The cover of Robert Johnson's \\"Stones in My Passway\\" is also a standout track, and I feel the strong hand of Kevin \\"Caveman\\" Shirley on this track: it's a fresh electric blues interpretation, butit maintains the doomy Delta vibe of the original. The arrangement is modern but preserves the song's elemental Delta blues feel. Joe's Les Paul has never sounded better than it does on this track!<br /><br />Of all the tracks on the disc \\"Too Much Ain't Enough Love\\" is the only misfire, and even that track may appeal to folks who are fans of the Aussie band Cold Chisel (particularly in light of the fact that Joe gets Cold Chisel's frontman Jimmie Barnes to handle the lead vocals). But to my ear this track just feels like a strange outlier.<br /><br />If this album is not quite up to the bar set by \\"Dust Bowl\\" and \\"The Ballad of John Henry\\" it is still a great entry in JB's discography and is not to be missed.<br /><br />Joe Bonamassa matures with every release -- not just his guitar work, which have become more fluid and supple with less bombast, but his vocals, which have been absolutely transformed in recent years. And as a fan I can only look on in amazement at Joe's work ethic -- here's a guy who plays upwards of 200 dates a year, releases at least one studio album a year, and still finds time to do side projects like Black Country Communion and his duet with Beth Hart. (If you haven't yet purchased \\"Don't Explain\\", I urge you to do so posthaste; it was one of the best albums of 2011, by far.)
B000WCDBKM|1.0|Move on to better stuff. If garbage were packeaged in a box with a bow, this film would be on top of the heap.
B006PTL1GC|4.0|I'd recommend this film for its source material, rather than as a movie per se. It tells a great story about some extraordinary people, and leaves one with a desire to find out more about them, (and in particular Jung) so for anyone interested in psychoanalysis, it's a must-see.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|When I first heard about The Hunger Games, I was weary of reading a book that people have made such a hype about. I decided to read it anyway and was amazed at the book. I couldn't stop reading it! The trilogy is amazing. Buy it asap! The characters are well developed and quite relatable to. Its a great read for both young and old.
B005LAIHR2|4.0|I saw \\"Rock of Ages\\" in a sneak preview tonight, and was pleasantly surprised by the overall experience.  I had not seen the stage production, but I've seen some other stage musicals converted to movies, and have been generally disappointed, sometimes appalled (I'm looking at you, \\"Mama Mia!\\")<br /><br />Set in 1987, the general plot involves a pair of newcomers to Hollywood, trying to become rock stars, but finding the closest they can get is working in the hottest rock & roll club on the Hollywood Strip.  From here, the story expands to include the owners of the club, a politician and his wife who are fighting the corrupting influence of rock music, and the biggest rock god on the planet, Stacee Jaxx, played by Tom Cruise.<br /><br />The movie starts out pretty cheesy, and the first few numbers garnered some giggles from the crowd, but when Tom Cruise arrives, he kicks the entire show into high gear.  Say what you will about him off screen, the man is a star onscreen, and does a phenomenal job in this role.<br /><br />The music was pretty solid, with the rock songs of the 80s performed by the actors.  In stark contrast to Mama Mia!, the songs here have been studio produced, and sound great, avoiding the bad karaoke effect such performances often have.  For the most part, the actors are not known for singing (who knew Tom Cruise and Alec Baldwin could sing?  OK so maybe Baldwin wasn't the strongest singer, but still decent for his role...)  Julianne Hough was likeable enough as the female lead, but surprisingly (considering a music career), her singing wasn't as good as some others.<br /><br />The movie got progressively better, and was quite funny.  But Tom Cruise carries this musical, and did so not only with very solid acting, but a shockingly decent rock and roll voice.  Without him, this would have been an unremarkable show.  With him, it is a fun movie that had people in the audience singing along with the film.
0345803485|5.0|Absolutely great story line and good reading if you can get past the taboos associated with the unknown.  Will read the series many times over.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|Before I was a bit skeptical about the FiiO E6, however, after using it I think my skepticism has gone away.<br /><br />The FiiO E6 pretty much unleashed my Sennheiser HD349 cans. I was looking for a set of quality, but less priced headphones - the Sennheisers struck it, but I read that the headphones were even better with their mids/lows when you used a Headphone Amplifier. I've read about distortion and audio quality problems with these products, so I was skeptical.<br /><br />That being said - the bass on these headphones are fantastic now, and everything sounds more clear than before.<br /><br />The build of the product is a square inch, made with a light weight, but seemingly durable plastic (it's not single piece so there may be some issue with wear and tear later along the line) - but, it's not finicky.<br /><br />The E6 comes with a belt clip, a USB charger and a line-in cable.<br /><br />Setup was easy - as I use this for my computer mostly - I plugged the line-in into the sound card, plugged the USB charger into the computer (product doesn't come with a charge out of the box) and then plugged my headphones.<br /><br />The FiiO E6 isn't customizable with it's equalizers, however, the three that are presented have their own purpose. The first EQ is a much higher bass equalizer, however, I found the sound to be a bit too muddled for me. The second equalizer is preferably my favorite, it couples the right amount of bass w/ volume, the sound isn't muddled and I dare say it's actually a bit clearer. The third EQ is a lower volume setting, which I believe is for higher sound level inputs.<br /><br />Honestly, only one of the EQs will be used for me and that's the second one (labeled EQ2 on the manual) - I would dock a star for a lack of cuztomizable EQ, but honestly this product does exactly what it says and it does it darn well.<br /><br />HOWEVER: I do not recommend you get these for stock ipod earbuds or skullcandies - frankly, this product shines for the consumer who wants to use entry-level studio cans like a Sennheiser for music/gaming (even though it advertises for mobile platforms, which it does do pretty well) without breaking the buck and receiving the power their cans can deliver.
B007MDQW3W|3.0|This is certainly not her best work. While compared to much of the regular market it would deserve at least four stars, I hold Ms.Spektor to a much higher standard. Drums are overused in many songs and most of them don't have that Spektor feel to them. She certainly under utilizes her piano playing ability in this album.<br /><br />1- Small Town Moon: A fun little song. Kind of catchy and well put together, just nothing special about it.<br />2- Oh Marcello: A very quirky song with interesting lyrics. My third favorite song on the album. The hook is from a Nina Simone song.<br />3- Ne Me Quitte Pas: I actually don't like this song that much. I much prefer the original over this one. This one just feels far too. . .tropical. Strong vocals though.<br />4- Firewood: One of the few songs on the album that moved me. The piano melody is kind of simple as are the vocals. There is something very soft and touching about this song. My favorite on the album<br />5- Patron Saint: Another song that isn't bad, just nothing very special about it.<br />6- How: A kind of sad song about parting. I rather enjoy it, nice and slow.<br />7- All the Rowboats: I am still not entirely sure what this song is about (art going to waste in a museum I think. . .) Tied for 2nd favorite on the album. A very intense song with wonderful vocals and lyrics<br />8- Ballad of a Politician: A wonderfully quirky song. Tied for 2nd favorite on the album. Interesting vocals, strong lyrics.<br />9- Open: This song frightened me a bit the first time I heard it. This song is kind of haunting and eerie in a way<br />10- The Party: A sweet simple song.<br />11- Jessica: A very simple and pretty song. A great way for the album to end

B003YMNVCA|5.0|I'm a programmer who has recently started working in Linux environments and also tried my hand at setting up a Linux server.  I'm a Googler...meaning, I can't remember the last time I bought a book for learning how to do things on computers - it's been 5-10 years since I bought my last technical manual.  Well, the problem I had is that Linux help is all over the board - I found myself searching for help wayyyyyyy too often, and typically coming up with solutions that didn't really sit well with me - they all felt hacked or half-baked.  After purchasing this book, I have a much clearer understanding of so much more than what I was looking for.  From an overall system perspective down to the nuts and bolts, this book is pure gold.  I haven't read the whole book as many of the chapters are extremely specific to what you're trying to accomplish, but I did read all the chapters on scripting and the general administrative view of Linux - you'd be amazed at how much clearer the waters will be after you get this information in your head.  Commands that always looked foreign to me now make sense.  Also, permissions in Linux are FINALLY presented in a clear and fairly concise form.  I highly recommend this book for anyone who is overwhelmed with the sheer lack of quality information regarding \\"why\\" or understandable \\"how to\\" for Linux.  No more RTFM's that you see scattered all over the web from Linux users.

B007U1FEJE|3.0|This is not a bombastic release, but a good one nonetheless. 3 stars leave it slightly above average as it's your standard BB sound that you recognize.

B00846REIS|5.0|Eva Tramell moves from Southern California to New York, looking to start over and leave her past behind. But she knows that no matter how far she trave3ls, her past is right there with her; always.<br /><br />Gideon Cross...Gorgeous, affluent, sinfully rich - he looks like he has it all. But Gideon is harboring a dark secret himself; which keeps him at arms length from all the people in his life.<br /><br />Eva and Gideon first meet when Eva goes to the building where she is starting her new job. She heads over the day before, to time out the trip on foot; she hates to be late and wants to make sure she knows how long it will take.<br />As she enters the building, a lady leaving, catches her purse on the turnstile, and upends it all over the floor. Eva observed several people avoid the mess; she bends to help out and starts gathering the belongings...as she chases down more change she encounters a pair of sexy black oxfords...she waits for them to move and when they don't she looks up and drinks in every inch of what is standing in those oxfords. Eva was stunned speechless - he was savagely gorgeous!<br /><br />Gideon is definitely intrigued by Eva. Through her first week at work - he finds ways to get her alone...and makes it clear that he wants her.<br /><br />When it's clear to Eva that all Gideon wants is hawt, sweaty, messin' the sheets, she lets him know that isn't enough for her; she's not interested in that kind of relationship - she needs to have at least a connection with her partner and to get to know them somewhat.<br />Gideon realizes that if he is going to have Eva in his life he has got to give more of himself...<br /><br />In this first installment of the `Crossfire' series, we ride along with Gideon and Eva, as they try to build a relationship. Things are not always easy. Both of them have darkness in their past. It's very interesting to see how two professed `broken and messed up' people find their way to love...struggling with triggers, jealousy, and possessive personalities.<br /><br />Ms. Day has created two very intensely provocative characters that I find myself rooting for. I believe if they can be open about their pasts - that they can help each other work through their darkness from the past.<br /><br />I am VERY much looking forward to the 2nd installments' release, coming sometime this year...<br />The 2nd `Crossfire' novel is titled \\"Deeper in You\\", and is a continuation of Eva and Gideon's relationship... \\"Bared to You\\" ends without any definite resolution nor any guarantee that they will work it all out to achieve an HEA.and possessive personalities.<br /><br />Ms. Day has created two very intensely provocative characters that I find myself rooting for.

B0079XPUOW|5.0|Redshirts is not just a fun novel about a science fiction trope; it is a spot on critique of modern televised, cinematic and, yes, even literary science fiction.<br /><br />Redshirts demands of science fiction creators that they not engage in lazy or trite writing.  It demands of science fiction fans that they not rest content with lazy or trite writing.  Finally, Redshirts serves as a pledge from Mr. Scalzi that he will at least endeavor to avoid temptations to laziness and awfulness, for the good of the genre.<br /><br />For the good of science fiction, everyone involved in its creation or consumption should read this novel and take its pledge.<br /><br />Had I enough spacebucks to spare, I would consider having a couple thousand hard copies of this book planted in strategic locations around the offices of a certain television network.

0071762345|5.0|Likeable is an amazing book, I own an online business and therefore am trying to utilize social media a lot to drive traffic and sales. This book was just what I was looking for. If you are the type of person who likes seeing the big picture you will get this book. It not only gives you steps to follow but also the \\"why\\" you should follow them.    For my business our response rate has definitely increased in social media and people have even started sharing our info with their friends. Also one of the best things of this book is that it tells you that if you leave a question on the authors Facebook page he will answer it. Its true he does so if you have social media questions you can directly ask the author. How amazing is that!    Luis Castillo  <...>
B00756GKBA|1.0|I listened to this album with an open mind. I really did.  This sounds like the same junk she put out in the 80's. Over produced, soul-less and tinny sounding.  Madonna has a talent for staging productions and creating buzz.  But musically, there ain't nothing there.  Would anyone listen to this if it was being sung by someone who looked like, say, Rosie O'Donell without makeup?  Who just stood on the stage with a mic, no dancing, no costumes, no flashing lights?  No, because without those \\"extras\\", without the fluff, there's nothing of interest in Madonna's \\"music\\" to keep anyone's attention for more than 2 seconds.
B005QUQP76|5.0|The look of this mouse is fine, but looks don't get the job done. The feel is great in terms of the finish, heft, button placement and click. Nice grip on the heavy duty mouse wheel.

A quick search of their forums revealed the fix:[...]  I would recommend this mouse for FPS gamers.
1401307787|2.0|I didn't have a real good experience with this book.<br />I found the writing to be very boring, babbling, and without substance.<br />I have a hard time believing how and why this book got so many good reviews.<br />One review stated how it saved their life.<br />If that review proves not to be staged, I am going to start selling magical rocks!<br />My advice is save your money on this mambo jumbo and bad printing.<br />Check out the great books by Bhante G. and Thich Nhat Hanh if interested in mindfulness.
0345529057|5.0|This book set was brand new in the packaging.  The price was very good and it was shipped quickly.  I guess my only complaint is that the books were obviously made after the show had been recorded but do not include the newest book in the series.  Probably just because this book is still new and they prefer to sell it seperately for $10.  I feel em.  Printed media has it hard these days.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Takes all the guesswork out of the battery life. Instead of going through the device menu for the fire, i just have to bring up the notifications and BOOM! It is there for me to see what % is left. Definitely worth the buck.
B0083GQVOC|1.0|They could of just...not. The entire movie is really like 30 minutes....the rest is various shots of her scrubbing her house, shots of \\"artistic\\" thinks like her feet her washing her hands...oh and Kevin smashing food .... Lots of long hallways and streets. There is almost no talking until well into the first hour. Again, they could have just not. The  trailer pretty much covers it with just a few scenes that could be wrapped up in a 40 minute tv spot missing.

0307346617|4.0|Worth reading if you like zombies, although the seperate narrative can get annoying. But as a whole from the start of the out break to the mop up and rebuilding its every thing you want in a book of this genre, lets hope they dont screw it up with a movie.
B005D63RQK|5.0|This series is fantastic.  It took a bit to warm up to season 1 (and by a bit, I mean three episodes, so not all that long), but once I got into it, I was completely hooked.  The actors playing Walt and Jesse (I'm terrible with names) are fantastic, as are all of the supporting cast.  Every season seems better than the last, and season 4 doesn't disappoint.  There really is no way to tell where the series is going, which I love - so much better than almost anything else on TV right now.
B0085P2Z6E|1.0|Game is difficult for my eyes without the ability to zoom in on objects. Pretty basic and quickly boring after just a couple levels

B005LAIHY0|5.0|Great movie. Words cannot express. Go see it. Buy it. Enjoy. Don't listen to over critical reviews who write a 10 paragraph essay on Amazon to seem like they know what there talking about. Less is more.
B004BLDD9Y|4.0|It might be a struggle to exceed 40W though.  That isn't a deal breaker.  The color thrown is good.  The bulb is solidly in the range of a bulb you want modest light from.  It fulfills that requirement well.<br /><br />I've used the first I bought for about 6 week and it is working fine in a 3 bulb chandler in an entryway.  I liked it well enough to order the other two as replacements for the CFL's they are replacing.  The lighting seems more warm and more attractive.<br /><br />With a lot of on/off cycling due to location, I do wonder if their life will be in years -- fingers crossed.  The CFL didn't have anything close to their expected life.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Why buy them one by one when u can get them all for a wayyyy better price! I started watching the show while in south America and I just wanted to know what happend after te season ended so I just had to get the books! So far I am always reading and reading. U won't be able to put this book down.

1572814136|5.0|I loved my cards. They remind me of what the old Stregheria Italian Witches would use. I will use these as a keepsake to pass down for generations to come.
B005LAIGOQ|2.0|I purchased this item from Amazon.  Reviewer Linda Pagliuco says it very well. Yes, there is the creepy house -- very well done  -- excellent lighting, or rather, non-lighting. The Gothic theme played to the hilt. But it seems like there is very little acting for Daniel Radcliffe to actually do. Yes, his Arthur character is brave to the point of being foolhardy. And Radcliffe plays the part well. But there doesn't seem to be much to it. I bought it mainly to see him, but I also wish to give credit to the other actors. Ciaren Hinds especially is very sympathetic and I like the job he did. But I still was underwhelmed with the story as a whole.  Finally, I was dissatisfied with the ending -- too awful in some ways, too \\"Hollywood\\" in others.
B00454U1NS|5.0|I adore P!nk... Everyone thinks we are related.(only because of attitude).. I could be her much \\"older sis\\". lol. Her music is great I own every song she has ever put out. As far as I'm concerned...that don't get any better than Alecia Beth Moore Hart..aka P!nk ;)
B0086700CM|4.0|i have always loved this game and was sooo excited when i found it on android! however it &quot;glitches &quot; sometimes and jumps when clearly slid left and so on. Overall though it is a great app and i highley recomend it!
0345803485|1.0|This is one of those moment when you feel there should be an option of reviewing something with negative stars or no star at all. You would want to read the book if you are either into soft porn or else you really want to feel nauseated, sick, awful. lightheaded and disgusted. This book definitely poses a great challenge in front of you to try to \\"Read it ALL\\" because it is sooo very impossible to finish it. Out of 8900 Kindle Pages, 8850 are on sick sex technique. Forget about a sense of love and maybe after reading it you will not feel like making out with your husband also. It just presents how a girl can do whatever when she hasn't had a chance to get screwed in twenty one years. I am still surprised how could this be a Best Seller? The only answer I can find to this is that both the author and whoever, nominated it as a best seller are actually \\"Submissive\\" in their real lives by force or by option and this is the only way they found to justify what they are doing. Extremely appalled and disgusted waste of money and above all waste of mind and sanity.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is the best game u can possably get for a kindle fire. by the way tip: u kinda have to think fast to play this game. AWSOME ;-)
B003UV8ZS0|5.0|I found this to be an amazing story.  Mysterious, thought-provoking and gratifying. Dealing with the age-old quest of mankind to believe.  Believe in something beyond ourselves -- that quality that I suspect may even be in our DNA.  Martel takes you on an unexpected journey of survival to unimaginable places and spins a reality of inconceivable fantasy with an ending I was totally unprepared for.  Perhaps I was in a coma not to have suspected it, but I was delighted!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love temple run. you can buy powerups and anything!! at the beginning it is easy then it gets harder
B006UKC566|1.0|It was boring as all could be and incredibly predictable. I did not like it at all. Complete waste of money, should of rented it for a buck from redbox, or watched it when it comes out on tv. Not worth the price.

B00785P2QC|4.0|A very Fun and Entertaining game that can be played for hours. would suggest it to anyone, also very easy to play.
B001NAT07A|5.0|Forget the bad reviews and razzies. Catwoman has to be reviewed as a stand alone movie with no relation to Batman or anything else. Halle Berry was super sexy as both Patients and catwoman. The story made sense and the action believable. Ovewrall a great movie.
B000VWE5OY|3.0|If you want, you can skip this season entirely and go directly to the superior Season 2, which makes enough sense without having seen this one.  This Doctor Who spin-off (watching Doctor Who beforehand is not required) concerns a semi-secret (all the locals know they exist, but not what they do) organization called Torchwood, whose mission is to defend Earth against alien invasion.  There's a time-space rift in Cardiff, Wales, so most of the action is based in that area.  The team is led by Captain Jack Harkness (apparently all of this first season takes place before Jack first meets the Doctor.)  We're introduced to Torchwood via Gwen Cooper, a cop, who is recruited into the team in the first episode.  Rounding out the team are Owen, who performs the autopsies, Toshiko (\\"Tosh\\"), hacker and gadget girl, and Ianto, who's a... \\"tea boy\\"?<br /><br />There's apparently a contingent of Ianto fans.  This must be based on later seasons, since the character simply doesn't have much to do this season, with the exception of \\"Cyberwoman,\\" and the less said about that episode the better.  However, there are two or three lines in that episode that makes it worth watching once.  But only once.<br />My favorite episode would be \\"Out of Time,\\" involving 3 folks from the '50's falling through the time-space rift into the present day.  Fans of horror movies may prefer \\"Countrycide.\\"<br />Ratings wise, there are two \\"sex\\" (without nudity) episodes, as well as gore, violence, swearing, and Gwen's boyfriend's naked backside, so I'd put it at about an R rating, but a light R,  more towards the PG-13 end of the spectrum rather than the NC-17 end.<br /><br />3.5 stars (ignoring Cyberwoman) rounded down to 3 stars because I gave Season 2 4 stars.
B002PJL85K|5.0|this is one the best interpretations of the legend of King Arthur  I have ever seen. The acting was top notch it had humor, action, racy when necessary. It gets better every time I watch it.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|it was working great but made other games stop working but other than that, it was the game of the year
B002PT1KH6|5.0|I liked this movie because it was a wild roller coaster ride full of surprises from beginning to end. And like other times when John Travolta played the heavy. He didn't apologize for being bad.
0345803485|1.0|First off, I have painters turning my laundry room into a \\"red room of pain\\".  Just want to spice things up a bit at home.<br /><br />In all honesty though, this is really a terribly written book.  Read all the other reviews, they do a much better job at describing the terrible writing than I can.  I have never read erotica, but didn't even find this mildly erotic.  Christian Grey must have a huge prescritpion for Viagra, since he can get it up about 20 times a day. The characters are unbelievable, the whole thing is unbelievable.  I am ashamed to admit, I read the entire thing, and the second book also.  Glutton for punishment, I guess, (hence the laundry room!) :)
B0009P42S2|4.0|overall a good movie. good animation, story and idea. the concept of the \\"steamball\\", is cool, but unrealistic. if you are into steampunk, you will get a kick out of it.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love it.I can play it all day my son is 4 and he loves it and he play it every time he can I recommend it to everyone
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is addicting. play it all the time. its very unpredictable and the game play is never the same
B005LAIHY0|5.0|UPDATE: Minor spoilers: After reading most if not all the reviews here...I was second guessing my first reviewing impressions. So I had to see it again. This time I wanted to see it in 3d. First the parts that were in 3d were really amazing but unfortunately those were pretty rare. This time I went in fully armed with almost every complaint in my head. I must say I actually enjoyed it more. I knew what answers too look for and most if not all were there. albeit most were really hard to find and masked by visuals and Rapices half naked body:) Answers like why is everyone taking off their helmet....well the Dr. said that the air was really clean even cleaner than their air. There were only 12 med pods made. Getting your hands on 2 impossible. Everything that David did was orders from Weyland but basicly he's searching for an identity within those confines. When asked he says he wishes his father dead so he could be free. The idiot that played with the snake and his buddy died as a result...well there is always one in the group and if you don't know who that is your probably it. lol If watch the movie and think something is impossible or bad science then your really not thinking this is a Sci-fi movie. 99% of space traveling movies are bad Science to our known Physics. Light speed travel is impossible. So think beyond our boundries....anyway I'm giving this movie another half star. The visuals are awesome. the creature creation is vivid and the best I've seen to date. The acting is top notch. It's not perfect so only 4 1/2 stars. Some things could be improved and a few more of the major questions answered but I'm sure they will come in the sequel to this prequel......For my first review read below....<br /><br />So I read some of the reviews yesterday before I went to the midnight premier, So I have to say did any of those reviews see the movie I saw or are they just being to critical of things that just don't matter!?!?<br /><br />Warning there will probably be spoilers probably extreme spoilers!<br /><br />  First off yes there are 17 crew members but only about 4-5 that were really utilized in the movie...do you really need to have a meet and greet with all 17 crew members to make a good movie. Absolutely not! Reviewers saying the main characters are underdeveloped but do you really need to know that the captain of the ship failed his captains test 3 times...No....the movie gives you everything you need to know...captain is the captain, the mission supervisor is in charge, The android follows programming....sorry I don't need to be led by the hand and told what everyones part has to be...I can figure it out!<br /><br />  Yes there are holes in the story line but I actually like it this way. I actually have a brain and can fill in the holes with my own imagination. Such as the opening scene of the \\"engineers\\" on a primordial planet takes the black goo and vaporizes into the water supply. It was never said that this was Earth(or the time frame of the event)but that is what the movie hints at. Matching human and engineer DNA. Also my imagination tells me that monkeys or primative man drinks the water supply and transforms into the humans today but with this being said the black goo on the earth sequence is not the same as the militarized version later in the movie...that goo does some weird stuff!! The main story line seems to be straight forward...Find the creators and have a sit down chat.<br /><br />A look at some characters:<br /><br />  Charlize Theron: Vickers: Mission supervisor...Hard charging straight forward. Some say she is evil but she is only doing what needs to be done to save the Prometheus from infestation. I think this was a good roll for her. Later you find out she's the daughter of Peter Weyland and this is good info even though she dies later. It explains why she has the billion dollar luxury suite (equiped with 700 inch semi-circular view screen and state of the art automatic surgery pod) and everyone else has crew quarters. later we find out what happens when they don't follow her protocal.<br />  Michael Fassbender: David: Android...As in all Weyland androids he's Weyland's evil hinchman and will do whatever it takes to succeed to Weyland's programming. This is a OCD wannabe human android...from picking up lint on a otherwise spotless ship to bleaching his roots...growing synthic hair or just wants to be human that bad??? GREAT JOB Fassbender! Reviewers will say he is fast to crack all the engineers door codes but nobody said the the doors were 128 bit encripted...maybe the letters on the door just say press here to open. He learns to fly the ship by watching the halogram...remember androids never forget! I think this was the best roll of the movie...<br />  Noomi Rapace: Shaw: archaeologist...Very good job she plays the part well...just to clear up something...she doesn't perform her own surgury to remove the baby alien...she gets in the automated pod...does it look painful oh yea! she is not the hero that Ripley is...she just trys to servive mostly!<br />  Logan Marshall-Green: Holloway/shaws husband: archaeologist...Reviews will lead you to believe that he is a scumbag alcoholic that mistreats Shaw. The facts are he never mistreats her. He drinks once because he thought his mission was a failure. He makes love to Shaw before he knew that he was infected...then he finds out something is going on(worms in the eye) he doesn't tell anyone but really who would? And finally he sacrifices himself so that the others could board the prometheus....sound like a loser to you? yea me either!<br />  Idris Elba: Captain: Don't really need a big roll but he's the kind of Captain that will go down with the ship....and he does!<br /><br />  Now the meeting of the Engineers....As stated during the movie...Prometheus was directed to a military bio-engineering base which was realize later in the movie. So the Engineers are hostile! This is the only part I don't understand...Why would they leave 35k year old directions to a military base? Maybe the directions wheren't meant for us??? Maybe the disintegrating engineer was a rouge and wanted humans to evolve...who knows but anyway the first contact with the engineers are hostile did you really expect anything different??? Really? What do you think would happen if you bumped into a Predator...doesn't matter what the odds are against him...he's not going to shake your hand and invite you to a cup of tea!<br /><br />  People are taking off their helmets on the first instance of breathable air this is because humans are inherently stupid to be the first person to breath alien air but as soon as the action starts you'll notice they aren't so ready to pull off their helmets. All the dead engineers are wearing there helmets but also they were running from some kind of infestation. Couple of reviews where wondering about this but really please watch the movie! Not only are helmets protection but also are better computer interfaces! Have you not seen Ironman? As for the design of the engineers helmets WHO CARES!!!<br /><br />  Religion is so subtle in this movie...not sure why people are making such a big deal about it....Shaw's cross was mentioned twice and towards the end she says she still believes in God...again a non-issue!<br /><br />  At the end of the movie Shaw decideds to take the engineers space craft to their home world....Well let see what would you do...return it to earth and because you almost gave birth to an alien be disected by the people in charge never to return to space...would you take the ship for a joyride around the galaxy or take it to the engineers home would to try and find out the answers you've looked for your whole life....myself I'm going for a joyride...definitely Earth is out of the question!!!<br /><br />  Ok so no matter what people are going to compare this movie to Alien...saying that this movie left more questions than answers....Well didn't Alien leave you with a 33 year question. At least now we know what that spacecraft was. It even touchs on the question where Alien came from...The very last creation of the engineers looks surprising like...you guessed it an Alien. This is not the first movie in the series nor will it be the last...I'm pretty sure some gaps will be filled in at a later date. Alien vs Predator vs Engineer and now we are out there too so vs Humans anyone???
B00881VLCE|4.0|I love these puzzles. They are the best puzzles most are free sometimes  the pieces are hard to pull but for the most part the puzzles are great..
B0013ND30W|5.0|When this came out in the theatres back in the 50's, I was sort of taken aback by the \\"strange\\" animation depicted on screen, having really grown up on PINOCCHIO and the like.  Of course, seeing the entire screen filled with the incredible colors and hearing the sound from every corner of the theatre did set a new high mark for Disney and their world of animation.<br /><br />Years later a copy, non wide screen, was released on video, then came a \\"partial\\" expansion, and finally, the original aspect ratio was allowed to fill the screen on DVD, with the advent of large screen t.v.'s.<br /><br />And now, the presentation of SLEEPING BEAUTY on Blu-ray brings the history (for me, anyway) full circle, though not QUITE as large as the original.<br /><br />Mary Costa (of old \\"live\\" t.v. commercials for refrigerators and Chrysler Corporation's cars, and the first Cunegonde in the national tour of Bernstein's CANDIDE right after it closed on Broadway and concert versioned across the US) brings her crystalline voice to full force as Aurora on the 7.1 soundtrack (although her Metropolitan Opera tour as Musetta in La Boheme was quite a tour de force without amplification).  And of course, the film itself is reproduced for the blu ray disc in high definition...quite a visual treat.  AND, you can practice your French or Spanish with alternate soundtracks.<br /><br />So, I'm happy.  I also found a re-seller through Amazon who sent me a spotless, good as new package of the film.  For anyone wanting to experience a beautiful hommage to medieval hour books, take a look at this film....and enjoy an addition to the incredible Disney villains with a dragon who just won't quit.  Maleficent indeed.
1455508977|5.0|The Lucky One, by Nicolas Sparks is a Romantic novel that follows the story of Logan Thibolt and Elizebeth Green. Nicolas Sparks has written many other books such as Dear John, A walk to Remember, The Notebook, and The Last Song. Sparks is a romantic Genious and can make you connect with the characters in a way that only skilled authors can. In the Lucky One he he tells the story of fate and destiny.<br /><br />Logan, a loner Marine, found Elizebeths picture in Iran and after no one claimed it, he kept it for himself. After he found her picture he began winning poker matches and had a near death expeirence that killed two of his fellow marines. His friend convinced him the picture was his lucky charm and when he came back to the states he set off to find the women in the picture with his dog in tow. He found her at a kennel she ran with her mother and soon learned she was a divorcee with a son named ben. The main problem that kept getting in the way of their love was Keith Clayton, elizebeths' ex husband.<br /><br />Two strong themes in the novel are fate and destiny. Logan was lucky to live during his time in Iran when many of his platoon mates didnt. It was fate that he came across the picture in Iran and that he found Elizebeth out of all the people in the US. You can say she was a needle in a haystack.<br /><br />Nicolas Sparks writes the book on the idea of fate, so readers may find some of the situations unrealistic. Although some may think that some situations may not happen in real life, I think that deep down everyone hopes that they find a love that was destined to be like Logan and Elizebeths. Sparks described their love when he wrote they were \\"lost in a world that felt as though it had been created for just the two of them.\\"<br /><br />Being a hopless romantic myself, I felt that this story was realistic and could actually happen. Now, it may be extreamly hard to find a woman just by a picture, but since their love was fated he was ment to find her. I feel that this book can give hope to single mothers that think they wont have a second chance at love, since Elizebeth was a single mother herself. Sparks makes his readers believe that there is someone out there that is destined to be with them. Readers feel the two were meant to be together when Sparks wrote, \\"When a man is that special...you're certain that no matter what happens, there will never be another one like him.\\"<br /><br />I have read other Sparks books, including The Notebook and The last song and Sparks never seems to disapoint. Like other Sparks books the book ends in a sad twist, but The Lucky One also ends on a happy note. I really enjoyed this book and recomend it for women of ages randing from teen to adult. The book makes you believe that your true love is out there and fate will bring you together.
B005JLN9OO|5.0|It came really quickly which was awesome...came it a sealed package with no damage, the album itself has a great sound I recommend buying it!
0553582038|2.0|Okay, I rarely write reviews but this just had to be done. What happened? I was so eager to read this book after the way the last book ended. Then I buy the 4th book & I just find myself skipping around trying to find the characters I'm interested in! I think I honestly skipped half the book & now I don't know if I should by the 5th because of all the bad reviews. Why did Martin do this to us, he's an excellent writer so surely he must have known that the books were heading nowhere? That the characters were getting lost? It's like bad sex, eager to start but near the end, you just realize there's not really going to be a satisfying climax (Tyrion might have liked that comment...if you could find him anywhere).
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I won't parrot the praise other reviewers heaped on this novel.  All I can say is that the pricing is wrong; it's too cheap.  Having read Blood Song, I would gladly pay the retail price of a hardcover book for the sequel.
B0085776BG|5.0|Your going to love this movie.  Great story and cinema photography.  This is a story about African American pilots, aviation mechanics, and support personnel during World War II.  Enjoy!
0439023513|5.0|I had been wanting to get this series, however did not want to pay what the bookstores demand!  I have been pleasantly surprised to find that I can get the Hard Cover edition of these books for less than paperbacks in the store.  All have arrived in good time and in excellant condition.  Thanks Amazon!

0307887448|5.0|Ready Player One is a brilliant/entertaining/thrilling love letter to the 80's -- a decade jam-packed with game-changing TV shows, movies, and video games. Author Ernest Cline (he wrote the film Fanboys) covers it all in his 370-page quest novel that's been dubbed The Matrix meets Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. That's a pretty astute comp, but there's also so much more going on in this book. From the get-go, you'll be drawn in by an A+ prologue that sets up the brilliant conceit of the story and ends with a revelation by the first-person narrator that will cause you to smile and start turning the pages. And be prepared to turn the pages at a rapid rate. I could not put the book down and essentially read it in three sittings -- the third being a \\"are-you-kidding-me-this-book-is-sofa-king-good\\" marathon to the end. If you are of the generation that grew up in the 80's, be prepared to relive your youth -- everything from Dungeon & Dragons to Atari to Pac Man to John Hughes films to Star Wars to War Games to Duran Duran to Rush. It's all in there. And it's utilized and referenced in such a brilliant way. I am obviously avoiding telling you much about the premise, because I do not want to ruin any of the fun of discovering it all for yourself. Trust me, it's a fun ride. Now get on it.
B006JPS1OM|1.0|too slow for a kindle fire need a little more power for my kendallers fire... ketchup..<br />but it will need alot more changes..
B002RHGYOA|5.0|Just when you thought it was a straight forward plot,it twisted around,  forcing me to just  turn one -more page.THEN the worst thing happens. You run out of pages and the book ends. I now cannot wait for the next book.

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|the movie is fantastic, a lot of action, ironman makes the movie very funny. I can't wait to buy the movie for myself.
B0086HJW76|4.0|Sounds like the great material from the James Gang days.\\"Analog man\\" speaks the truth just listen to the lyrics! if your a J.W fan this is a very good album.\\"Funk 50\\" answers back to \\"funk 49\\" in a good way and \\"lucky that way\\" finishes \\"life's been good\\". Life's been good,i am \\"lucky that way\\"!<br />\\"India\\" another stand out track.Overall the album is a little mellow for me, would have liked to have had some more songs like analog man but still worth having with some very good guitar work thru out the l.p<br />You can also get in on vinyl and cassette...nice work Joe!<br />Like Joe says  (there are no \\"b\\" sides on a mp3) I agree, that analog recording sounds best!
B007IXWL2C|1.0|My instincts said not to get caught up in the hype & frenzy but my curiosity got the best of me - darn curiosity! If anyone ever knew a Dom they would understand how absolutely STUPID and irritating these books are. And they BARELY skim BDSM at all. The old Anne Rice \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" books are FAR better. I now realize why I stopped reading \\"romance\\" books when I was 15-16. While I understand Fiction is not fact, there has to be SOME reality to it - this story is completely unrealistic and ridiculous. How a 21 year old meets a tycoon approx 2 weeks prior to graduation who is a Dom, agrees to be a sub when she has ZERO \\"sexpertise\\", then backs out only to have the dom chase after her because he can't live w/o her and then ends up married like 2½ months or so later is ridiculous. And to top it off from the starting line she is a \\"pro\\" at oral sex - um, yeah. Ok. Ana never really gives you a description of herself and neither does Christian - but apparently every man who crosses her path \\"wants\\" her (according to Christian)and other characters keep telling her how beautiful she is - ok, there are \\"those kinds\\" of women out there, but generally they KNOW they have that \\"hold\\" over people. For someone who is apparently oblivious to their looks it is COMPLETELY unbelieveable that she would use the term \\"inner goddess\\" to refer to her inner \\"voice of reason\\" or conscious or whatever you maye choose to call it yourself. About ½ way into book 1 I was SO over that \\"inner goddess\\" stupidity. Of course by the end of book 1 you can tell it is going to ba a love story - but I always have to know what happens whether I like the book or not - just like that moronic Twilight mess! The last 2 chapters of book 3 are gratuitous garbage. Why did I need to basically re-read Chapeters 1-2 of book 1 all over again from Christian's eyes? It did little to add to the story or answer any lingering questions. But kudos to Ms. James for putting in a \\"thank you thank you thank you for reading\\"at the end - her readers deserve EVERY one of those thank you's. Even more now after having read these books I have to laugh at the number of women on the bus/train as I commute who sit in their seats with silly grins on their faces reading these books. The book is gratuitous sex page after page - let's solve all \\"issues\\" by just having sex. You know once Ana says \\"Oh I think he is mad at me\\" or something along those lines that you are mere paragraphs away from pages of sex. Seriously - if you are questioning whether or not to read these books, save $30 or so, some sanity and time and just don't! If I owned these as actual books and not on my kindle I would have shredded them -they annoyed me that much.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|WHY is the Kindle price of $9.99 higher than the paperback price of $9.57??? I haven't bought new Kindle fiction in months - so disappointed that the court ruling against publisher price-fixing hasn't resulted in lower prices.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|best app ever! I can keep all my info at all times,  its a life savior. there is no other not app like this one!
B001LMAK88|5.0|For those of us who love a good shoot-em-up western and who miss those glory days before directors decided that westerns must be psychologically-driven, \\"Silverado\\" truly fills the bill.  The good guys are genuinely good, the bad guys are dastardly bad, the damsels require saving, and Lawrence Kasden has wrapped up the entire package with his own brand of humor and brilliant directing.  Add to that the exciting score by award-winning composer Bruce Broughton and the viewer is promised an evening of sheer fun and enjoyment.  If you need an additional push in the right direction, check out the cast.  \\"Silverado\\" is packed with a list of your favorites.  So pop the popcorn and settle back for a wonderful family evening.
B0006Z2LH4|4.0|It was a good sequel. A little more drama. They tried for the intensity of the first and did an ok job.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|good control setup. but you get about 10 games at first and you have to keep playing those games over and over to unlock new games.
B007ZRZF8I|1.0|Seriously? The game is pretty decent, after it decides to force-reboot my device when it finishes the first cut-scene. Dunno why the hell it would do that in the first place.  Another key interest is that it includes OpenFeint, a hidden social app in-game that personally? I don't give two F's about. Good thing this game was FREE for today. I hardly pay for games as is unless I -really- like it and want to support the devs.    Adverts in game.  In-game-with-real-money-purchases  OpenFeint    Go jump off a cliff. -.-;
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this app because it keeps me entertained and it is jut fun to play! I have been waiting for this game to come out on Kindle for a really long time! I hope they make more Apple&reg; apps for the Kindle&reg; soon!
B006ZCWTXS|5.0|X-Factor runner up Rebecca Ferguson's debut album, Heaven, gently begins with an understated love anthem.  Ferguson croons, \\"nothing's real but love\\" and you can't help but believe her.  With a fusion of soul and pop, Ferguson's jazz themed voice is right at home in each track.  Shying away from the vocal acrobatics that some new 'divas' strive for, Ferguson creates a web of emotion that softly drifts to the listener.  However, is not to say that she doesn't light up the mic with a few head-swaying thigh-slapping jams, such as \\"Too Good To Lose\\" and \\"Mr. Bright Eyes,\\" which draws comparison to the sound of Heather Small and Amy Winehouse, respectively.  The track \\"Fighting Suspicions\\" creates a creamy sound nearly evoking Nina Simone as Ferguson praises the \\"lies that drip\\" from her cheating boyfriend's lips.  Listed as co-writer for every track on the album, Ferguson is clearly a talent to take notice of.  Her artistry is already classic and I'll be anxious to see her career progress.  Overall, this is a classy release from a young struggling mother, who despite hard knocks, held tight to her chanteuse dreams.
B0086700CM|5.0|great game.hope it never changes.the graphics are great.and i like that it get faster and harder as you keep running.

B007JM4CWY|5.0|If you like this sort of puzzle, this implementation will give you hours of enjoyment. Very nicely done. Easy to look at with good controls.
B0079XPUOW|4.0|Yes, I read this book quickly because I enjoyed it... though the ending (before the codas) seemed to come too quickly. And yet, the whole time I was reading it I was aware I was reading a story where the author was aware I was reading it, and that I was aware that he was aware... The result was kind of like when you take a trifold mirror and position the two side panels so you can see yourself, and then yourself seeing yourself, and then...<br /><br />The point is that while it's fun to look into trifold mirrors, doing so while reading a fictional work (where you expect reality to wash away) is distracting. For good Hitchcock movies critics talk about being sutured into the story line, that our entire reality becomes the screen, and I think Old Man's War sutured readers into the story line. This did not. Even if I enjoyed it.<br /><br />So be aware of Redshirts' distractions. Take them with the story.<br /><br />I had forgotten there were 3 codas, or 3 short stories. The first one was interesting for a few pages and then I started reading quicker and quicker because it didn't grab me. It read at times like Scalzi's blog, which can be great or just like, \\"Hey, this is a picture of a cat.\\" The second story, told in second person, was better, though for some reason I wanted to read the whole thing in present tense and that was throwing me. Also, because the character of the second story was so loosely attached to the novel, it felt like Scalzi was standing over him with a magnifying glass and chuckling, \\"I will light you on fire with theme!\\" I did think that as sf short stories go, this was a pretty literate story, and may outweigh the book. The third story, told in third person seemed another literate attempt to give the story an ending. Did it work?<br /><br />As I think about whether or not the codas worked, I think it is fairly obvious to point out Scalzi's musical hobby. And, as a sf loving music teacher, I couldn't help reflecting on the idea of codas in general.The idea of a coda is to bring us back to the form, give us another taste of the theme before throwing in the all important chords that sound the ending. My problem with coda 1 is that it felt too much like a departure from the overall form of the book. Yes, it was tied by content (or the meta conflict of that particular story to the novel length story), but it seemed to lack a grounding in character, which to my mind, is like switching from punk to country in the outro. Though the 2nd coda's character was loosely attached to the novel's story, Scalzi managed a great piece of magic to unearth the form of that story and in so doing redefined the form of the novel before it. It felt like some of the hardcore sf from the 60's and 70's--though still contemporary, if that makes any sense. The 3rd coda? Scalzi stayed with the contemporary riff, still holding his magnifying glass of theme in hand, and yet he was able to create a character who felt real, and yet allow her to end on the absurd, which is probably a perfect conclusion to the novel length story.<br /><br />Is Redshirts Meta? Very. But the 2nd and 3rd codas at least step away from that for a moment. They are the best pieces of writing between the flaps, and they work to give structure to a novel that would have been incomplete without them.
0679805273|5.0|I give this book to all my high school graduate relatives.  It makes a great gift and helps set the path for the next giant step in their lives.  Both books arrived on time and in perfect condition.  Thank you.
B004JQN364|5.0|I ordered the Dragon Man at the same time as the Papo Medusa. They got here quickly and were in top condition. The paint on the Dragon Man is incredible! The picture doesn't do him justice! The battle ax and sword are both removable witch is nice but be careful with his jaw. It seems like it might come off if opened to hard or to wide. The Medusa is also fantastic I'm pleased to say! Her snake hair and coiled body look so life-like! I will most certainly buy from Papo again!

Rest your minds... it has room to spare!  I love it!  Thank you Opteka for saving me almost $150!  My unit came assembled, all I had to do was adjust the straps to my size and voila!  PERFECT!  It does not look and does not feel like a $40 product, well made, no broken seams, connectors in place. I mean this is one of the best bargains I have ever bought!  My 7D and T2i are happy in their new holster.
B004V2AWKG|5.0|This is one of the most thought provoking children's book I have read.  An important book that forced you to think.  It's best for children, but people of all ages can enjoy it.  It really inspires people to think about their values and beliefs, and encourages people to question everything.  A great gift for any intuitive or curious child, as well as adults.  The only downfall: it's over much too soon!  Highly recommended!

B005OK721G|5.0|When I heard this movie had a lot of bad reviews and then I heard it didn't do well in the movies, I wasn't going to rent it.  But there is the fault.  I can't let other people's opinions be my opinion.  I decided to watch this movie, and I thought it was absolutely excellent from beginning to end.  When I watch movies like this, I expect the unexpected.  I got it here.  I expect uniquely thought out scenes.  It was in there.  This movie just wasn't in your face blow up everything all the time.  It was emotional.  It was mean.  It was smart.<br /><br />I have to say my favorite scene is when Colombiana was running from the bad guys.  It was a great scene to watch.  A little girl isn't supposed to win in the real world against drug goons, but she did in this movie.  She won and got away.<br /><br />Movies like these are meant to pull you away from boring reality.  For the most part, most of us live normal uneventful lives, and Colombiana splashed an imaginative story of an assassin in your face.  I appreciate it for what it was trying to do.  Of course, some of the things, I will was like 'no way', but I had to remember it is just a movie.  Now and days, you can fly like superman in a movie, and you have to realize that's all it is.  A movie.<br /><br />If you like sexy, young women who can kick butt and can operate an anti-tank missile and tame huge ugly dogs and swim with sharks, this will encompass it all.
B005VPRETE|5.0|My seven-year-old daughter enjoys playing with Legos but it has been difficult to find a series that really engaged her attention as she is quite a girly girl and enjoys fantasy play revolving around dolls. Many of the Lego series seem catered more to boys, and some of the gender neutral sets are a bit more complex for her - we worked on the townhome once and she lost interest after a while because she found it complicated, even with my help (and I ended up working on it!).<br /><br />Well, I came across this Lego Friends series while browsing online and it seemed like a neat idea for young girls to develop an interest in Legos. My daughter loved it, and she actually persevered and worked on it last night for about an hour, until she completed the entire tree house and bird house! She loves the little Olivia Lego doll that comes with this set and has been asking for more! I am definitely getting her more from this series because it has not only engaged her attention, but also increased her patience and level of concentration as she worked on it. It is also a great toy for building hand-eye coordination and developing one's imagination. The bricks come in small plastic bags labelled 1 and 2 and there is a full-color instruction booklet that provides step-by-step instructions. To avoid losing the pieces, I placed them in small plastic containers found at home and labelled them so that it was easy for my daughter to work on the set. A recommended toy for young girls interested in Legos.

B007MDQW3W|4.0|Regina's sixth album, fourth distributed on a major label, is pretty much what you would expect from Regina in the natural progression of her musical talent.  \\"Cheap Seats\\" really does seem to encompass some of the best elements of her earlier work and the production sensibility of her more recent work.  Part of the reason may be due to the fact that many of these songs were actually written years ago, such as \\"All the Rowboats\\" and the revised \\"Ne Me Quitte Pas\\".  But the new songs are just as engaging.  I know she has been writing the music (but not the lyrics) to a new musical, and I think I can hear some of that theatrical influence, as well.<br /><br />Just two quick things to add: (1) The album is short and, unfortunately, feels short---a mere 37 min, 20 sec.  (2) The version of \\"Call Them Brothers\\" on the deluxe version is a new recording and not the same as the version that appears on Only Son's album [[ASIN:B004BBDHE0 Searchlight]].  I personally prefer this new version quite a bit.  The guitar goes perfect with Regina's and Jack Dishel's singing.  The singing itself is more passionate.  For those who want to own the physical CD, I would recommend doing that, but also download the bonus tracks from the deluxe version ([[ASIN:B0082JYEEO What We Saw From The Cheap Seats (Deluxe Version)]]) while they're available for individual download.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I really love this game. Very addictive and even when you lose you don't feel like you lost because you've gained money along the way. After I beat the game at 50 I couldn't believe there was more Part 2 here we go so excited! I love this game.
B007M45PMU|5.0|You should buy this CD. If you got to this page, reading this review, you're here for a reason. Maybe you like this kind of music and Amazon made a recommendation, maybe your friend suggested this album to you. Either way you should buy this album because it's much better than you think it is. This is the only album so far this year that I've purchased where I don't feel a need to skip songs to get to the stand-outs; they're all stand-outs. It's full of well-crafted songs (with great lyrics) and catchy hooks that get stuck in my head for days.<br /><br />Buy this album
B007RXC3A8|3.0|I was very excited when I heard that Sonata Arctica was coming out with this album. They are my favorite band, I have every last album. I even loved Unia and enjoyed Days of Grays. So when I say that this album came off as weak, that is where I am coming from.<br /><br />There are good tracks. Only The Broken Hearts is a pretty solid track. Despite the radical departure of style, I like Cinderblox, though the vocals could have been better. But there are also some tracks that just don't gel, like Shitload of Money. Wildfire 2 and 3 sound cool, but are not very congruent with the original in content or style, which bugs me, perhaps only because I loved the original and wanted more of it.<br /><br />The whole albums is very disjointed, running through many styles and sounds. It really does seem like a collection of B-sides. I'll be dumping a few track from this onto my playlists, but I am hoping that the NEXT album is better. If you liked anything previous from SA, Stones does not really have anything for you. If you like Sonata Arctica because they are who they are, you need to get this. ...And if this is your first Sonata Arctica album and you like it, you had best preview the rest of their work before you buy it, because it really is different. Not \\"Unia is different from Reckoning Night: different, but \\"Kamelot is Different from Sonata Arctica\\" different.<br /><br />...not trying to scare people off or say that this sucks, but Stones is VERY different and experimental. Know what you are getting.
0062124293|3.0|I picked this up because I thought it sounded as though it might be funny. I needed funny. I had no idea who Caitlin Moran is - still don't - and now that I've finished this book, I'm rather glad I don't. The book starts off when Ms Moran is 13 years old, and it is amusing, in the way most of us can recal our beginnings as amusing. I even had a few laugh out loud moments.<br /><br />And then? Well, let's just Ms. Moran and I come from different backgrounds (she's from the UK, I'm from the USA, she's almost 20 years younger than I), and we have differing viewpoints. If I think back to my mid-30s, I can imagine having some of the same insights she gives in the book. However, having reached my 50s, my insights on being a woman are far different. I can understand a younger woman's interests, yet I know what life is like once children reach those teenage years and beyond, what it is like to grieve a close family member (and spouse), and what it means to face menopause. All the things Ms. Moran admits to not having experienced yet. And, very important to \\"being a woman.\\"<br /><br />Ms. Moran bemoans the idea that women often attempt to halt the aging process in their mid-30s. Yet, she writes a book on \\"How To Be A Woman\\" while still in her 30s. To me, it was if she were saying that once a woman hits her 30s she knows all there is to know. Far from it - especially if that woman considers Lady Gaga her emminent role model in life. (As Ms. Moran seems to believe)<br /><br />This book was engaging...for a while. I grew tired of Ms. Moran's pontificating, as I do with most people who are 20 years my junior and admittingly haven't experienced what I have. I would advise Ms. Moran to wait until she experiences the teenage years of her daughters, until she experiences the deep, deep grief of some one close to her dying or suffering a major illness, and experiencing all the wonders that menopause can offer a woman before telling us all \\"How To Be A Woman.\\" Until she has aged a bit, and experienced ALL that life has to offer for women, I think it is impossible for this young woman tell all of us how to be a woman.
0765316994|4.0|This book  is yet another fantastic read from John Scalzi and in many ways is a return to his roots.  This novel,much like his first Agent to the Stars, is a well written work of science fiction mixed with a healthy dose of humor and an eye for the absurdities of life and in this case hackneyed SF tv shows and their seemingly endless tropes.  While short this novel does not disappoint, I give four stars only because of the short length, the content within is five star.

B007MDB71O|5.0|Despite the fact that everyone and their mother who bought this will no doubt write a review stating something very similar, I loved this movie so much I'm going to write one too; John Carter is a great, fun movie.<br /><br />Most people missed this one for 2 very big, very unfortunate reasons, the first being the marketing done for this movie was abysmal. I mean really, truly terrible. Second, for whatever reason, the media practically crucified this movie up to three months before it even premiered. I heard reports that this film was destined to flop before I even knew what it was called. For reasons I still can't fathom, no one in the media was on this films side. They didn't give this film a snow balls chance, much less the benefit of the doubt. Completely ignoring whether or not the film was good, they continually harped on how much it cost to make. As detrimental as that was to the movies eventual release, it is the first reason that really sealed \\"John Carter\\"'s fate.<br /><br />I can honestly say that I have never seen marketing this bad. The first trailer I saw for John Carter was a silent clip that showed no film footage and told me nothing about the film. As the weeks rolled by, things did not improve. The few commercials I saw made it look like a conan the barbarian rip off. Even the name \\"John Carter\\" hurt this great films chances of success. None of that matters though, because it is finally on DVD/Blu Ray and you can buy it for yourself, without having to wade though terrible ads and misleading media coverage.<br /><br />John Carter is about John Carters adventures on mars. I won't reveal more than that. The characters in this film aren't too deep, but they are enjoyable. The main antagonists are never fully explained, but they are no less effective because of it. The effects in this film are some of the best I have ever seen, and if you have a hd capable television, you are in for a treat.<br /><br />John Carter deserved to be a hit in the theaters.While that is no longer an option, at least now we can make sure it recieves the love it deserves on DVD/Blu Ray. Who knows; if enough of us buy it, maybe they'll make the much deserved sequel.

B005LAIGN2|1.0|Leave WWII to Spielberg Lucus, This has to be one of the worst moderately budgeted movies I have EVER had the displeasure to press play on. This movie is so bad is makes George Lucus's Howard The Duck look like a master piece. let me start by first saying I come from a very large military family. My uncle was a colonel for the Army Air corp in WWII, and my other uncle Was a 101st paratrooper who fought and was captured during the battle of the Bulge. I have great respect for the men and woman of WWII, especially the Tuskegee airmen. This movie makes a mockery of it all.<br /><br />When the film started, right from the first scene, the dialogue was so cheesy and bad, I thought it was mimicking a comic book. any minute I was wating for the screen to turn to pages as a kid read them. It showed a \\"evil\\" looking German pilot with a malicious grin as he shot up B-17's. Then you see an American pilot say \\"Germans! lets get em!\\" and they leave the bombers....It gets far worse from there. Nope, not a kids imagination...it kept going, this was the movie! In fact...the movie is so bad, and I am so frustrated, I hit pause on it right now, and am writing this review with it still on my screen.<br /><br />The moving is so over the top and melodramatic I just about turned it off. Its that bad. I feel so cheated on this movie. In fact, in honor of the men who fought and died in the air war over Europe, I'm straight up insulted. It's full of cheesy dialogue that makes an elementary school play look like Broadway, and the constant racism rhetoric in the movie just adds to the overall feeling of an agenda based movie being shoved down your throat with no other attention given to detail. It's as if Lucus wanted to make a point so bad, he forgot how to  make a film. There is nothing wrong with the message, but delivery is everything and this falls way short of what you should expect from a large budget film.Fact is,Lucus had a very hard time getting this film off the ground. He could not find anyone in Hollywood to back it, and then went on the record in interviews claiming that the reason his movie \\"Red Tails\\" was having trouble was because \\"Hollywood was racists\\". He stated the following:<br /><br />\\"This has been held up for release since 1942 since it was shot, I've been trying to get released ever since,\\" said Lucas half-jokingly to Jon Stewart on the Daily Show on Monday night. \\"It's because it's an all-black movie. There's no major white roles in it at all. I showed it to all of them and they said, 'No. We don't know how to market a movie like this.'<br /><br />yes George....that must be it, its because of the all black cast. It couldn't possibly be that the script was horrible and your movie sucked? The Tuskegee airmen were great men who did wonderful things for the nation. This story deserves a serious movie, not a slap knee joke this film turned out to be. I felt like I was watching a kids cartoon with dialogue this bad.<br /><br />I had high hopes for this film, however I was let down. Fact is, 27,000 Airman of WWII perished, more then that of all Marines lost during WWII. Think about that.... The air war was very terrifying and brutal. Hardly the tongue and cheek scam this movie is. If you want to see a decent movie about the air war, watch Memphis Bell from the 90's. If you want to see the real grit of it, watch WWII in HD The AIR WAR.<br /><br />How anyone can watch this film and think its a great portrayal of our airman in WII is beyond me.t find anyone in Hollywood to back it, and then went on the record in interviews claiming that the reason his movie \\"Red Tails\\" was having trouble was because \\"Hollywood was racists\\".

B007ZRZF8I|5.0|I think gravity guy is better than angry birds. It is very fun. it is better than cut the rope and many more games.
0345803485|1.0|I only heard a snippet of conversation about this book on the Today show. A friend of mine told me to get the book. I really wish I hadn't.<br />The writing was horrible along with the editing. I honestly don't know how someone could say they edited this book and went along with this final piece. I like erotica when it is written the way it should be written. Anne Rice is terrific at this. Her sex scenes are hot when they aren't erotica.<br /><br />I had a hard time with Ana. She came off as a complete idiot. I had no compassion for her and seriously could not care less what happens to her. How many times can a girl blush or flush without being permantely red? Her \\"inner goddes\\" I would loved to have smacked. No one could seriously be that naive without having some mental issues in this day and age. Especially when her best friend had sex all of the time.<br /><br />Christian was not the sort of man I would fall for. His control issues would have stopped any feelings I had for him. I don't care how sexy the guy is - and I have yet to meet a guy who is sexy enough to cause every woman who meets him to blush, shake, bat their eyelashes and basically orgasm right there on the spot - I understand he had issues in the past but there isn't a chance in this world that a naive, boring, clumsy virgin will ever be able to heal him after only weeks of knowing him when years of therapy hasn't even begun to touch his problems.<br /><br />I also don't understand how they even heard each other speak when all they ever did was whisper. I have never read a book in which the characters all whisper at each other. Doesn't the author know how to talk in a normal voice. There were so many problems with this book and I can't even begin to put them all down.<br /><br />I suppose for some women the sex scenes were great. I personally have read better ones that did have me waking my husband up in the middle of the night. This book was definitley not one of them.
B007WFR1MQ|3.0|This latest effort seems to lacking depth as far as the music goes. It is Fear Factory there is no mistaking that but it is only two people. I am not a huge fan of drum machines which is all there is on this effort. When it comes to ranking it this is one of the worst they have put out...Mechanize was much better and even that was so-so. I keep waiting for their next Archetype but seeing as how you have Dino back and got rid of Christian Woebler and Raymond Herrera it will never happen.<br /> I could not find one track that really got my attention it was all just a bland effort musically. I see many people liked this but as for me the lack of depth leads me to believe that a better title for this would have been \\"The Minimalist\\".

B007OWG3LM|5.0|After reading some of the less-than-glowing reviews I hesitated in purchasing this one.  So I listened to Valtari online last night three times and then raced to the music store today on my lunch hour to pick it up.  An mp3 download just wasn't going to be good enough for this album.  Love it, love it, love it.  It is like a calm, quiet, clear day on the water.  Just lean back and smile as you float along with it.
B0087DFIOU|5.0|With Mel Gibson doing himself no favors in the public media over the last six years, GET THE GRINGO is a much-needed reminder of why we loved him so much. While it was greatly refreshing to see Gibson on screen again in EDGE OF DARKNESS and THE BEAVER after an over- bearing eight-year absence, GET THE GRINGO does the best of capturing everything we truly loved about Gibson's performances: charm, wit, humor, edge. The script by Gibson, director Adrian Grunberg and producer Stacey Persky is an original and tight balance of humor, edge, and danger that can very easily be considered an unofficial sequel to the theatrical cut of Gibson's cult favorite, PAYBACK. While the character of GRINGO's Driver never reveals his actual name, he possesses a lot of the same qualities as PAYBACK's Porter, including a U.S. military tattoo, a chain-smoking habit, sticky fingers, an iron jaw, and a penchant for bloodshed. Grunberg's direction is also solid with an obvious love for Sam Peckinpah paraded throughout.<br /><br />For those of us who endured so many years of understandable negativity towards Gibson for his personal troubles, GET THE GRINGO is the film we've long awaited. It's truly a shame this film won't be seen wide in the U.S. It would've been a better comeback vehicle than EDGE OF DARKNESS was meant to be. GET THE GRINGO practically screams, \\"Remember me? I'm still here, and I still got it!\\"<br /><br />But if one thing is certain, it is that in the age of home entertainment, every good film gets discovered by an audience. Sooner or later...
B00881VLCE|5.0|Can't find the free puzzles mentioned in the other reviews. Not much fun without them. Give me a hint? It sure would help to know where to find them.
0345803485|1.0|I've read better on the back of a porn DVD. If you want a kinky thrill, read the Training of O. If you want romance, read Richard Feynman's \\"What do you care what other people think?\\" If you want a well written story with believable characters, read the blurb on the back of just about any porno DVD! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!
030758836X|4.0|Beware of reviews!  This book is too good to spoil by learning too much about it first.<br /><br />It's a rarity, a whodunit that doesn't depend upon 1) main characters turning stupid in order for the plot to unfold or 2) plot elements being withheld by narrators who were aware of them.<br /><br />The book begins on a 5th wedding anniverary, when the wife disappears.  Her husband, an unreliable narrator, admits at the start that he has told some lies.  He just doesn't tell us what they are yet.  The clues the book lays down are later taken up and put to use.<br /><br />I hesitate to say more.  The plot is complex, the characters are intriguing, and you'll be emotionally engrossed. Gone Girl is great fun and you won't be able to put it down.
0061784788|4.0|James Rollins provided plenty of suspense coupled with previously established characters from the Sigma Force series. You don't have to read any of the previous Sigma Force Novels to be caught up in this one, but it does help. The novel is about some curious aspects of US early history and legend,-the idea that the American Indians were involved with the \\"lost tribe of Israel,\\" the Golden Tablets of Mormon fame, the secrecy and super curiosity of Thomas Jefferson and Ben Franklin on the subject of the Indians-,  woven into a modern thriller.  It is well written, and I enjoyed it.

0307346617|5.0|In Max Brooks post-apoptotic zombie story World War Z, he (Brooks) is a journalist who is collecting data and describes the events following the ten-year Zombie war from the different views of different people all across the globe in the.  The story starts with an American doctor in China when they are called into a small village after there was a small outbreak of an unknown virus, where upon discovery the doctors are shocked to see a small child trying to attack them without arms our legs and he is dubbed \\"Patient Zero\\" (for being the first reported case). The story shifts to unknown border agent who job was to try to stop the disease from spreading via illegal organ trafficking, where Brooks shortly after reports on a story from a Brazilian doctor who tried a heart transplant on a patient with an infected heart where we learn more on how the disease spreads. The story soon moves to the Middle East were mayhem is starting to erupt among nations regarding immigration survivalist. The story really starts to pick up when the pandemic enters America because of the ease of it spreading and really shocks you because you would expect the U.S to be prepared, also this is where the most heroic/action pack gruesome scenes take place. The story fast forward a few years to the U.S.S Saratoga where the U.S president decides to fight back and reclaim the Earth. Brooks main idea toward the story would be of him showing the unedited first hand accounts of the Zombie War and how it affected peoples life. The rest of the story you need to read on your own because it is to good to tell.<br /><br /> Max Brooks is a classic horror story author, and I would put him along side other great writers such as Edger Allen Poe, or Brooks' good friend and associate George Romero. He wrote this to continue on with his trademark zombie theme he has been so good at and Brooks loves to write zombie/apocalypse type books and this has to be his best on by far.<br /><br /> Brooks used his iconic evidence and imagery to convey his thesis and it gave it a more authentic feel with the use of the reporter/interview structure of the story. Everything from severed body parts, crawling arms, to shotguns and revolvers, help show the classic world-ending zombie invasion. Also the revolving themes of survival, uncertainty and your minds darkest thoughts give the story a more creepy feel to it.<br /><br /> World War Z is a classic Brooks style writing and fits right in with his other Zombie books like  Zombie survival Plan. It is also very eerie do to the possibility of this all happening especially right after the random cannibal outbreaks that have been popping up all across America.<br /><br /> Overall this is an excellent book, and I recommend it to everyone whether our not you're a zombie fan. It is a little confusing because of the different writing style used, and the random jumping aroundness, yet once you get into a couple of pages you will have a hard time setting the book down trust me. With the addition of the upcoming movie directed by George Romero, it is an even more reason to read.
0345803485|5.0|This book is the BEST book I have read in a LONG time!! I stayed up til 3:30 in the morning reading. If you are a J.R. Ward fan you will fall in love with this! The writing style is fabulous and the deals are very colorful. This book is not 6th grade writing material, and I wish the people that say that will write a book and see how others down it. Anyways a GREAT read!! Baby Bomb might happen soon!! Enjoy!
B0051BVQFG|4.0|Having served two combat tours in Iraq, I can pretty much vouch for this being an accurate war film. It was intense and realistic enough that it knocked on the door of the old PTSD, but it was awesome enough to keep me watching. Responses to previous critics: repeating phrases (move! move! , etc.) is common military practice to ensure everybody gets the message - there's no time for \\"sorry, what did you say?\\" in combat. And putting Starship Troopers or Independence Day in the same box as this movie is ludicrous - this movie followed a realistically depicted Marine unit repelling an invasion, while Starship Troopers' military was nothing but bad Hollywood cliche, and Independence Day's actual military battles were all completely unrealistic air strikes and most of the movie didn't involve combat of any sort. So this movie used a lot of standard tropes - big deal! They're standard because they sell movie tickets. This is an awesome movie for fans of real modern war flicks like Black Hawk Down or Jarhead. If you're a sci-fi buff to boot, more the better. If you're looking for deeper meaning, try the \\"Foreign Films\\" section.

B000JMKQX0|3.0|If you're searching for a zombie horror story, you won't exactly find it here.<br />The book feels like a real doxumentary, but like a documentary, it can get sometimes boring and repetitive.<br />Also, there are some holes like how it went in Israel, while tey tell only how it has started there but not how it was dealt with.<br />Also, some parts are highly technical, and some of those technical details repeat themselves in other chapters.<br />Also, it's hard to follow the characters.<br />Another thing is that you won't emotionally attach to the characters, because most of the time they mumble about irrelevant stuff.<br />And at last, don't expect rich language, it's written as if it was transcribed from interviews.

0142000655|5.0|East Of Eden is my favorite book of all time. It is not nearly the best, the most respectable, the most polished or most intellectually compelling, but it is my singular favorite. It reminds me a bit of Chaucer's Cantebury Tales, often enough relying on the bawdy, even the implausible-- or occasionally knowingly dubious science-- to further plot entanglements, but ever weaving hooks of melodramatic delight. Steinbeck writes inside a woman's brain as can very few men. He artfully meanders through different lives and generations, often willfully steeped in bits of caricature as with Adam,Samuel and his wise Chinese friend, frequently surrounds us in contrived circumstances, all by design. How else can we be introduced to Catherine/Kate: the single most deliciously evil bad seed who ultimately emerges as the single most deliciously willful, outrageous,independent and morally indifferent woman of her century, a woman who, in recollections well prior to the film's focus, gives birth to unlikely twins in the most amazing of circumstances.<br /><br />  One of those third generational boys is portrayed- in his single most brilliant performance riviting from its opening moments(among only three films in which he ever appeared)- by James Dean as Cal Trask. That film version commences fully two thirds through the book. We watch a young man following an older woman who pretends to be unaware of his presence. That particular slice of drama slowly builds to shocking enlightenments. For me, the other book (of roughly that time) to film leap a single character's brilliant portrayal so effectively is Rostand to Ferrer's Cyrano, but I digress.<br /><br />  At first I had difficulty with the author's opening in East of Eden, which takes us through nearly a score of scene setting Salinas Valley pages before Steinbeck begins his masterly hypnotic storytelling. When I posed this personal dilemna to a classrom of students, they were fairly evenly divided on that author's decision. The half who loved it were almost all studying art as their elective, whereas the other half had chosen another course. Later in life, when I came to draw as a hobby, I too appreciated Steinbeck's initial soft scenic opening before many following tempests.<br /><br />  From too perfect paternal men both Asian and American of one generation through too flawed authority in another, there finally arrives in a third at least one character who has a chance at something both plausible and good. We herein also encountered women too hot, too cold and like, in the fable, one just right, once again all by design.<br /><br />  My beloved shrink sister-in-law (at the time) gave me two great pieces of advice: get a shrink (which I did) and read East of Eden (which I did). My favorite memories of teaching involve that book multiple times in the context of an NYC gifted program.<br /><br /> Finally, I am so jealous of most who are reading this indulgent review. The presumption is they have not yet, for the first time, realized the joy of savoring this unique treasure, perhaps both in the literary and film version. Steinbeck is, for me, along with Hawthorne, the greatest American writer and storyteller. I would love a selective bout of artful amnesia to experience such memorable firsts once again.

B001ANYDAO|3.0|Gladwell lacks rigor (just run a google search for detailed criticism), but this book contains some interesting anecdotes (most memorably the relationship between birth dates and team selection in sports) and one important idea: focused, hard work breeds success.<br /><br />Worth reading, or at least skimming, but maybe pick up a copy in the library and double-check any details before you use them to make substantive decisions.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I stumbled into this book while looking around Amazon for something new to read.  I am always on the lookout for books rated by hundreds with over 4.5 stars and surprised to see this one pop-up, which I had never before heard of.  At the price, how could I resist!  But my review is independent of price, for me the true price is the time I invest reading a book - and this was very worth it.  A great book that is cleverly crafted and well written.  I am always in awe by authors that can invent completely novel tales and this is definitely one of them.  If you read this review, then you are intrigued already, pull the trigger and read Wool.  @ Hugh Howey:  Thanks for taking the time to write great books.  I'll be reading more of yours.

B007ZRZF8I|1.0|In this game, your character runs in a single direction, and you can reverse gravity to run on the floor or the ceiling to avoid obstacles.  There are no other controls, just tap the screen to switch.  That's it.  Yes, it really is as dull as it sounds.<br /><br />I might have given this app 3 stars for its mediocrity, but the developer chose to include in-app purchasing.  I would have no problem with this if the app were free, but when game developers start wanting to nickle and dime you in a paid app, it's time for people to put their foot down.<br /><br />This app has OpenFeint installed, even though there is no button for it or mention of it in the description.  If you put your phone into Airplane mode and start the game, you'll get a Feint offline notice at the bottom of the screen.<br /><br />If you like this sort of game, I'd recommend [[ASIN:B004W3PYKM Yoo Ninja! (Ad-Free)]] instead.  It's the same price, same type of game, but without in-app purchasing and without secret OpenFeint.
B003O86FMW|1.0|The second book was  basically a repeat of the first. Was very disappointed. Will not be bothering to read the 3rd. book. It seems the writer ran out of good ideas for the second. She should have gone on  to complete the series in two books would have been better. We didn't need for the Heroine to go through another Hunger Games and spend  1/2 the Book on this aspect.
B005LAIHXQ|1.0|More is definitely less.<br /><br />\\"Did you ever see the movie 2010?\\" Stanley Kubrick once asked a resident screenwriter.  \\"They ruined it. They explained everything.\\"  There's an old maxim in creative writing.  Never TELL your audience - SHOW them.  That maxim has been both ignored and abused in the case of Prometheus. The filmmakers show you too much and explain just about everything too.  Director Ridley Scott's return to the Alien universe is mostly non-triumphant.  On revisiting a flame he he first ignited in 1979, one done with a great minimalist and atmospheric effect, Scott has betrayed his success by employing a genuinely odd and disjointed script, perfunctory direction and an endless hall of monster's closet scares.  Ridley is much better than this.  In fact, I'm hard pressed to find if he's ever been worse.  If you don't want to read the rest of the review, I'll cut to the chase right here.  You ever see the recent prequel of The Thing?  It was good, not great, but good.  Well Prometheus is pretty much the exact same movie, but much much stupider and no where near as absorbing.<br /><br />Prometheus is a concept film, wrapped in leftover sets and costumes from Avatar and spiced with Creature from the Black Lagoon.  Despite how hard the movie  tells the audience what we are watching is an Alien \\"prequel,\\" (or by the end he's trying to tell us its a prequel to a prequel), I'm hard pressed to find any substantive in execution to connect Pormetheus Alien, Aliens or even the jumbled Alien3.  Those films were at best, riveting.  At worst, in the case of Alien 3, boring.  I will stop there with comparisons because all that followed Fincher's mess really don't bother mention and I believe this one could fall into that category.  Aliens vs Predator may even have a better script..<br /><br />I know right?<br /><br />Exposition is at a premium here but development is scarce.  From the first scenes, mystery is left to the dogs and before we can immerse ourselves inthe unknown, voluble lectures of the plot yet to unfold are given ad nauseum. Prometheus is essentially two films.  One is a concept of human origin, the other, and the majority in general, is an endless series of monster's closets.  Just when things settle down and it feels as if we could be watching an actual science fiction movie, the jumpy music cues, gooey scares and terrible dialog set in.  Then there's the other half.  A nebulous origin story - one that could be interesting - is buried under rubber chicken on the string gags.  Oh but there are mysteries.  Why do they keep taking the helmets off?  Why bother having them at all?  Why did nobody ask Liz about her quickie operation and that nasty \\"leftover?\\"  That's just the short end of it.  How can we trace our DNA to these tall aryans?  Then what the heck were the Neatherthals and all the other humans we share nearly identical DNA with? The script displays the trademark ravenous touch for dead ends of writer Damon Lindeloff, one of the head writers of TV's LOST.  He should stick to television or perhaps working the McDonalds drive up, or would he screw that up too?  Deus ex machina is at a premium, character exchanges are laughable, scenes pace with the tempo of a video game commercial and I still can't count how many endings the movie had.  That last \\"reveal\\"  was certainly a laugh, because a lot of the people in the theater found it funny.<br /><br />But it's not all bad.  Noomi Rapace is a decent match for Sigourney Weaver and proves yet again, even in the face of a terrible script, she will pull off anything handed to her.  Just like in the superior Swedish Dragon Tattoo film, her unwavering commitment to her character shores up a meager story and holds us to the end.  Michael Fassbender too gives a noteworthy play as the android and gives Lance Henrickson's turn in the same boots a run for his money.  I don't know what Charlize Theron and Guy Pierce were doing here but she and everybody else are simply cashing a paycheck.<br /><br />Where did humans come from?  I don't know but the mystery of who bankrolled a script this bad is a conundrum worth solving.  It is pretty obvious why Ripley never wanted people to know where the Aliens came from.  She saw Prometheus and knew it sucked.  Ripley warned us and tried to save us, but we had to ask.  Now we know Ripley, now we know.
B006LSZECO|5.0|The story flips back and forth between present and past. Nick narrates the present, while Amy's side of the story unfolds through her past diary entries. Amy and Nick are writers, unemployed writers. They used to live in New York, but moved to Nick's hometown in Missouri to help his sister care for his sick and aging parents. Things are looking pretty bleak. Bleak is just the beginning though. Now Amy is missing.<br /><br />Gillian Flynn is fantastic at using language to set the tone. You know you're in for a ride right away. Slowly the past and present come together. As they do, Flynn drops little tidbits that make you think, \\"Wait... what was that?\\" Those little tidbits scratched at the back of my brain. I felt like I was squinting into shadows to make out something I just saw move. Those shadows are real, and there's an unbelievable twist hiding in them. This is a psychological thriller that continually surprised me. I loved this book. I've read both Sharp Objects and Dark Places, but I think this one is my favorite.

B00466HM28|2.0|Purchased this item to use as a midi controller.  Have had many keyboards over the years but this is my first USB midi controller.  All the functions work well and it works with my software.  I am very disappointed with the keys; both of the keyboard and the pads.  The keys are very stiff and required a lot of force to get them to play.  I am a very large man and have big, heavy hands and it makes my hands tired having to press the keys hard enough to get the required sound.  They are touch sensitive keys but should to be a lot easier to press and use.  As for the pads, forget about it.  Have to hit them really, really hard to get sound out of them.  Lights work etc but they are too stiff also.  I've had keyboards that included pads, years ago, that you could play with pencils.  This one would need the handle end of a screw driver to get them to play.  Even hitting them very hard, with heavy fingers, you still can't get dependable response from the pads.  The keyboard is very small(keys are a bit too small)and easy to carry and seems to have good build quality but if it's too hard to play it isn't worth having.  This one is going back for a refund and I'll buy another midi controller. I would have rated it a one but it does have a few workable features other than the stiff key issues.
0553288105|2.0|During the first part of this novel, I realized just how much science Asimov was cramming into his science-fiction. The characters and plot took the time to detail the scientific basis of their world. That doesn't happen much anymore, and I was really intrigued.<br /><br />Then I hit the 2nd part. The novel suddenly becomes bogged down in alien social networking and a seemingly endless string of dialogues about conforming to expectations. This new mode went on and on and on.<br /><br />I finally had to stop reading.

0439023491|5.0|Catching fire by Suzanne Collins is the second book of The Hunger Games trilogy that introduces a world after devastation divided into the Capitol which controls all affairs and twelve distant districts who each serve the Capitol.  At one time, there was a District Thirteen, however, when they rebelled, the Capitol annihilated them to establish their authority over the other districts.  Catching Fire is after Peeta and Katniss' victory in the Hunger Games when the Capitol is very angry for humiliating them and cheating the point of the games.  Katniss' act of rebellion served as inspiration for the other districts and President Snow ordered her marriage with Peeta to emphasize that attempting suicide was only out of extreme love, not rebellion.  To top off her confusion and stress, this year is the seventy-fifth Hunger Games referred to as the Quarter Quell, calling for a special twist where one boy and one girl victor from each district will reenter the Games, making Katniss the only possible girl for District Twelve to go.  When they are down to only a handful left Katniss is able to destroy the force field enclosing the dome and wakes up in an aircraft where she discovers Haymitch, the Head Gamemaker, and one of her allies from the arena.  They explain there has been a colony of rebels living in the ruins of District Thirteen and that's where they are headed, but they were unable to get Peeta out before the Capitol took him, and there is no longer a District Twelve.  We are left hanging to read more in Mockingjay, the last book of this suspenseful trilogy.  Suzanne Collins portrays how people always fight hard for what they believe in and the people they love.  She also implies the government will go to any length to control everything and everyone.<br /><br /> Collins views the government as slowly destroying our modern society and reflects that in her series.  She is most likely writing this book to encourage people to not conform to the desires of the government which is so corrupted and rebel to establish proper and just rule.  These purposes are very peculiar considering that Collins had primarily written children's books where kids would not pick up on these messages nor put them to action.<br /><br /> Collins shows people fighting hard for loved ones and what they believe in when she describes Katniss protecting her best friend when she says, \\"Instead I throw myself directly between the whip and Gale\\" (186).  Haymitch describes Peeta's plans in the arena when he proclaims, \\"...I now owe him.  Anything he wants.  And what he wants is the chance to go in again to protect you\\" (Collins 178).  The domination of the government is shown when President Snow orders Katniss to marry Peeta when Collins writes, \\"The Capitol will insist on it...He means there's only one future, if I want to keep those I love alive and stay alive myself.  I'll have to marry Peeta\\" (44).  The government will also kill people when necessary shown when, \\"A pair of Peacekeepers dragging the old man who whistled to the top of the steps...And putting a bullet through his head\\" (Collins 62).<br /><br /> The author uses this evidence throughout the entire book to emphasize her main points.  These direct examples are nearly continuous throughout Catching Fire suggesting Collins' great discontent with the government and the need for conflict to prevent unjust policies to be strongly implemented.<br /><br /> Catching Fire has very convincing arguments because Collins repeatedly draws the reader back to the main point so they do not get lost in the book and bypass over the hidden messages she wants us to reflect on about our own current reality.  Collins is proving the government will go to all length to control their citizens when President Snow declares, \\"...a reminder to the rebels that even the strongest among them cannot overcome the power of the Capitol...\\" (172).  She repeats this message multiple times to emphasize its impact on Katniss' life and ourown life connected to the political world.<br /><br /> This book has very similar ideas of 1984 that discusses the control and domination of governments and hopes of overthrowing them (except this is much more interesting).  It is also similar to The Giver, a utopian novel that outlines everything the government withholds from citizens.  It can be concluded that Catching Fire is related to utopian and dystopian books.<br /><br /> This is a very interesting book that provides hidden insight on everyday issues.  This action-packed romance that deals with political problems appeals to younger kids around ten all the way to grandparents, males and females, looking for some books that will sweep you into the pages with its intriguing story line.  This book is enjoyable for such a range of people and ages because it has traditional fictional aspects that are fun to read with a deeper political meaning for the more mature audience.  I suggest this book to all readers, if you aren't a huge reader, after this series you might think twice about your view on books.own life connected to the political world.<br /><br /> This book has very similar ideas of 1984 that discusses the control and domination of governments and hopes of overthrowing them (except this is much more interesting).

0345803485|1.0|I read erotica often and specifically lifestyle works and found this book utterly frustrating and very disappointing. I fail to understand why and how it's a best seller. This book is potentially dangerous to readers who want to try to live out kinky/lifestyle fantasies in real life. This book is not a reasonable account of REAL lifestyle Master/slave or Dominant/sibmissive dynamics or kink life/scenes. Those relationships are not instant and take lots of time and work. The safe list was laughable, it excluded some stuff while including fireplay? Fireplay can be dangerous but often experienced by and can also be very relaxing to actual kinksters. I could go on and on but to keep it simple: This book is a fantasized mockery of people who do live the kink lifestyle.
0345522303|5.0|For more reasons than I'm going to take the time to say, the Nightrunner series has always meant a lot to me. I cannot understate how grateful I am that Ms. Flewelling has wrote them --- or that the series is being published so regularly now. I suppose the thing I like best, other than the massive emotional investment I, like many readers, have into these fully-realized characters, is that the story is so....refreshing. Nice, even --- in the sense that there's action and adventure, without brooding and over-wrought emotion; there's darkness without sensationalism; there's a lot of lightness and playfulness; and best of all, it has an actual, strong, tight story to support it. (And it's not a skimpy purchase, either; Ms. Flewelling gives readers value for their money.)<br /><br />Looking back, I'm not sure I described myself well. Maybe what I'm trying to say is that I enjoyed every second reading this story. Not for one moment did I feel that the author was trying to manipulate my reaction. If a scene made me sad, it's because it was a genuinely sad scene; and if I laughed, it was because something was genuinely funny. The fact that I've spent so much time with these characters in previous books just made the experience that much deeper and richer.<br /><br />Thank you, Ms. Flewelling, for writing this series. I hope you have many, many, many books left in you.

B006T5FDLG|4.0|Thankfully, there are some heavy Metal bands like Metallica, that just won't die. No matter how old they are, they still kick metal butt. However, the Metallica sound changes over time. So, from \\"Load,\\" to \\"Death Mangetic,\\" they are alot different from \\"Kill 'Em All\\" and \\"Ride The Lightning.\\" \\"Beyond Mangetic is know different. BM still has the sound of \\"Death Magnetic\\". Infact, I noticed that some songs on DM sond like ones from BM. Beyond Mangetic is just a little different. The songs are still long, so get ready for maybe the longest EP you every heard. And I tell you, its if you liked \\"Death Magnetic,\\" you will like these 4 songs. I like \\"Hate Train\\" because there is still a tuch of Metallica in the song. For ex, the song starts fast and heavy, than slows down to a nice guitar riff mixed with everything else. \\"Just A Bullet Away\\" is a nice and heavy 7 minute song. With a random quick end, and chord change to further the song. \\"Hell And Back,\\" and \\"Rebel Of Babylon\\" are really good as well.Over all,buy it

0439023521|4.0|In this jaw-dropping novel by award winning author Suzanne Collins, a young female warrior in a post-apocalyptic world must battle other warriors to stay alive. Years before the story began, the common people revolted against their superiors and were unsuccessful. As punishment, this resulted in the establishment of the Hunger Games, an annual battle between twenty-four contestants who are forced to fight to the death. Katniss, the story's protagonist, comes from humble beginnings as her family lives in one of the country's poorest regions. Katniss' younger sister was chosen for the Hunger Games, but Katniss knew that she had to save her sister and volunteered to go instead. From there, Katniss headed to the Capitol (or main center of their district) to prepare for the games and did remarkably well in her practice. Peeta, the boy chosen to go with Katniss to the games, reveals in an interview that he has a crush on Katniss, possibly to gain support for sponsors of the game. As the games develop, alliances are created and friends are betrayed, sacrifices are made, and romance develops as the warriors get desperate. Katniss must persevere and fight through all this conflict if she wants to be able to return to her family.<br /> Suzanne Collins purpose in writing this novel is to relate this topic to modern government as the social class gap continues to divide the population, and she wants to remind readers that a corrupt society such as the one depicted would not be impossible. To begin with, The Hunger Games is directly related to modern society as Occupy Wall Street movements testify to the growing social discontent between the poor and wealthy classes. If a violent revolt took place, this may be the future of society as we know it, because the wealthy class would dominate society and be easily able to subject the lower classes to their brutal laws and rituals, similar to the dominance of the Capitol in The Hunger Games. In addition, Collins had originally createdthis book in 2008 to deal with the possible dissolution of major countries in the distant future, for example, the United States. This book was written during a time in which the economy was in a frail state and it demonstrates the author's concerns for the economic welfare of the United States as many were questioning the possibility of an American economic comeback.<br /> Going beyond the story, the author clearly wants the reader to support more equality for females. For example, Katniss is the leading character in the novel and is a strong willed, independent woman. By having the main character as a strong willed and warrior-like woman, it is obvious that the author supports feminists and feminism to strengthen women. Furthermore, by requiring that one male and female be selected from each district, the message that men and women are equal is more blatant. As the females and males can both be warriors, it is quite obvious that Collins supports gender equality in every aspect of life, even the unpleasant ones.<br />  This book is an instant classic and it is well with reason to say it is one of the most successful books of this decade. The reasons why this book is so successful are simple: it is a romantic success story that everyone wants to hear, and it has just the right amount of action in it to keep readers entertained.  The romance appeals to females as Katniss struggles to find love. She has learned not to get attached to people because she feels she will eventually lose them. This is clearly evident as Katniss fakes romance with Peeta who shows much interest in her. Many readers can relate to her as they too have an unwillingness to love because of a fear of a loss of that love. On the other hand, males, such as myself, will enjoy this book for its more gruesome, wild, and action-packed moments. When the games began, I could not stop reading the book because my eagerness to see the next victim took over. This book is primarily recommended for high schoolstudents as the diction is not too sophisticated and it has the type of drama that high school students crave. Adults may want to read this as well, mainly because it is an interesting novel, but also because they can discover more about what the modern American teenager enjoys and thinks about. My only complaint about the novel is that the ending is somewhat predictable and expected. (Warning: Spoilers) The book ends with Katniss surviving the games along with Peeta as they romantically enter a train. To me, this is too cliché as the protagonist comes out of nowhere to win it all and even wins a date. Overall I would have to give this book 4 out of 5 stars as it was a fascinating novel, but I was able to foresee Katniss' triumph early on. This book is a must read for teens and should be read by adults, and it is worthy of being called one of the most successful books of the decade.

B0079XPUOW|3.0|This novel opens with a motley group of soldiers in a space station looking out the window at the starship they're about to board.  Extreme violence and snappy dialog ensue.  Toward the end a character meets what appears to be a clone of his dead wife.<br /><br />Sound familiar?  Does it sound like \\"Old Man's War\\" and \\"The Ghost Brigades\\"?  But these striking similarities didn't occur to me until well after I'd read this book.  Maybe I'm slow.  But in my defense, in all other respects, \\"Redshirts\\" couldn't be more different from Scalzi's amazing earlier novels.<br /><br />The book has a heavy dose of something one might call \\"metafiction\\"--the book acknowledging itself.  Rest assured that Scalzi handles it decently.  He doesn't insult the reader or disappear up his own backside.<br /><br />Beyond that, it's imbued with a lot of the melancholy that lurks under Scalzi's other books (that, indeed, sometimes turns to sentimentality in those books).  But it also lacks the propulsive, overwhelming narrative that had readers of his earlier books strapping on seatbelts.<br /><br />I think this book is a meditation on what meaning we can take from our lives given that--if we're lucky--we live in a universe merely governed by absurd random chance.  Scalzi's answer isn't amazingly original.  It, too, will seem strangely familiar.  But the journey is entertaining, and, as always, Scalzi ultimately respects his readers.<br /><br />John Scalzi had been compared to Robert A Heinlein more than once.  Heinlein too experimented with metafiction in his later years.  [[ASIN:1433212927 The Cat Who Walks through Walls: A Comedy of Manners]]<br />is a good example of this strand of his work.
0345803485|5.0|I was skeptical of this book and the first chapter proved me right. The quality of writing, from sentence construction to dialog content, was terrible.  Ugh.  But then I...kinda...started getting in to it. This is absolutely like an adolescent fantasy (I'm in my 30s), but I. LOVE. IT.  I distinctly remember having fantasies as a teenager about men that were too good to be true, totally unrealistic, and ridiculously sexy.  If you can get past the first chapter (which you should still read since it introduces the characters) and accept that this is total fantasy, you won't be able to put it down. It helps that I imagine the main character, Christian, as Christian Bale. :D
0307592731|3.0|The author's solid appearance on \\"The Diane Rehm Show\\" in March, 2012 piqued my interest enough to get the whole story. While the book is certainly adequate, I enjoyed the radio interview more, as it conveyed the essence more concisely and with less repetitive self-absorption. Cheryl Strayed deserves praise for her dedication and persistence in completing a very difficult challenge for which she was woefully unprepared. Of course, overcoming rather self-inflicted issues drives most of the narrative, which otherwise would have been mostly just another journey of self-discovery, resilience and healing after adversity, this time set in particularly notable scenery.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love it but it is the best game ever I saw in my world I will share this game to my friends
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I am not going to go on about the whole story line.  I am a high school librarian and read a wide variety of different generas.  I don't think I have read a book like this for a very long time......one that has kept me glued to the pages and up late in the wee hours of the morning!  This is my first BSDM book.  I found the story plot a very magical and intriguing and a little mysterious (why Mr. Grey was the way he was).  Some have given bad reviews due to Mr. Grey being \\"to good\\" to be true with his riches and things he can do....but I am here to tell you.....EVERYONE can dream.  If you are wanting a book that you can't put down and are eager to get home to read.....this is the book for you.  But my warning to you ladies....I promise your laundry will go undone, dishes not done, and dinner will be late!  A very good friend of mine is a labor & delivery nurse (currently reading book 1) says that there is going to be a BABY BOOM in about 9mos. due to everyone reading these books.  They are going to call it \\"Babies of Grey\\".  You never know who's life it might spice up!

I'm not sure if I even care to read the second book, and didn't find a huge amount of emotion like other readers did and the ending left me wanting way more. I would only recommend this book if you have nothing else to read!

0345803493|1.0|I wish I hadn't gotten curious about this book.  I could have so much time back that I spent telling myself this would get better.  It didn't, it was terrible. The first book in the series was not great but this one is actually terrible. The main character is awful and poorly written. She believes vanilla sex, oral sex and two spankings count as \\"all manner of kinky.\\"  She and the main character barely know one another and yet, inexplicably, love one another. And though she professes to love her boyfriend, refers to him repeatedly as an effed up monster and as having \\"baggage\\" because he has nightmares.  Hmm...must be love.<br /><br />As another example of the poor writing of this character, at one point, she is at her wit's end with her boyfriend worrying that she'll leave him.  Then he tells her something and  she thinks more terrible things about him and then wonders if she really can stay with him. When he asks if she will stay, she explodes at him for daring to think that she'd ever leave him. WTF?<br /><br />But the thing that really made me start pulling my hair out as I read this was that the author set the story in the Pacific Northwest and yet the American heroine uses words like \\"arse\\" and \\"gobsmacked\\" - not to mention all the other little British things (like tea and soccer -- that by themselves wouldn't be a big deal) but they just keep coming and you lose what little suspension of disbelief you may still have had. And although the heroine has a very limited vocabulary (especially for a recent college graduate) she inexplicably uses a $10 word every couple of chapters that will have most of us angrily hunting for a dictionary.<br /><br />Both the writing and the editing are poor: typos, oft repeated words and phrases, sex that ends the same way over and over. This is thinly disguised fan fiction that has more than its share of \\"Mary Sue\\" wish fulfillment, boring sex and a whole lot of condemnation of kinky sex and the people who like it.  I feel as though someone saw the first book in the series and thought \\"Aha, a book that has kinky sex in it, we should publish that right away before someone else thinks of doing first.\\"  Seriously, it was that ridiculous.<br /><br />The kinky sex wasn't really delivered on and both books in the series so far seem to be saying that no normal person would ever want that anyway.  I suggest if you want to read a better book that actually delivers good writing, interesting characters and mildly kinky sex, you try \\"Delicious,\\" \\"Wicked Ties,\\" or \\"Surrender to Me\\" by Shayla Black.  They are good, well written stories that have some hot sex happening between interesting people, IMO.

If you have cancer or know someone with cancer skip this.<br />The failure of the book is that it stays within the bounds of the three legal methods of curing cancer.

We are lucky others write on cancer cures.

B004WJRF6C|3.0|Released a scant week after McCartney announced he was leaving The Beatles -- as shrewd a marketing move as it was dastardly, as Lennon had already announced his intention to leave but was convinced to temporarily keep it to himself for the good of the band -- McCartney wasn't Paul's first solo project (he had previous scored the John & Hayley Mills film \\"The Family Way\\"). But it was easily his most important, his opening salvo and statement as a solo artist freed from the frustrations and expections with which he had been encumbered as a Beatle.<br /><br />The result is... certainly something nobody expected. This was a true solo effort; Paul played every instrument on the album! Guitars, bass, drums, percussion, keyboards, mellotron, vocals (with the only assist coming from wife Linda on some backing vocals), Paul did it all with a 4-track recorder, either at home or in the studio. And as a result, the entire album feels entirely homemade.<br /><br />McCartney is a trifle, but a pleasant, interesting one. Other than the smash hit \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\", which is easily as great as anything he ever recorded as a Beatle (although never released as a single; the version from his live \\"Wings Over America\\" went top 10), there's little else that can be categorized as truly great. What we do have is Paul, for all intents and purposes, getting the Beatles taste out of his mouth and recharging his batteries.<br /><br />Some of it works nicely. Some of it is forgettable. Some of it is leftover Beatle material. Most of it sounds like interesting outtakes. It's a testament to where Paul's head was at in late 69/early 70. \\"That Lovely Linda\\" is a throwaway, a twee bit of improvisation he did while testing out his 4-track recorder. \\"That Would Be Something\\" is a repetitive piece of piffle, a gentle toe-tapper with some nice acoustic accompaniment. At its best, it would have been a throwaway track on \\"The White Album.<br /><br />\\"Valentine Day\\" is the album's first of five instrumentals. Even though he played it entirely himself, it sounds like any other band simply warming up. For the album's first three songs, we've had nothing terrible but nothing really substantial. Thankfully the first fully formed song appears next with \\"Every Night\\", a strong, heartfelt tune with great hooks and musicality that we expect from McCartney. And at just over 2.5 minutes, it's gone too soon.<br /><br />\\"Hot as Sun/Glasses\\" is the 2nd instrumental of the album, which starts with a bit Paul composed in his Quarrymen days and gives it a nice Caribbean spin. It's instantly more memorable than Valentine Day. The 2nd portion of the track \\"Glasses\\" isn't as good; it consists of tones generated from the rims of glasses, and then breaks into a vocal portion that ends abruptly. Loved the first part of the track; the second, not so much.<br /><br />\\"Junk\\" is another gentle, pleasant acoustic number that Paul was originally demoed for (but left off) The White Album (it can also be heard on Anthology 3). It's fairly forgettable and, at 2 minutes in length, is gone just in time. The problem is, again, it *feels* like a lesser Beatles track that was left off a studio album for good reason.<br /><br />\\"Man We Was Lonely\\" has that sweet reverb on the opening lick, and I appreciate the vaudeville/ragtime feel of the chorus (although it gets grating real fast.) Linda's backing vocals are shaky during the verses. An OK song at best, mediocre at worst. The parts are definitely better than the whole.<br /><br />As we get to Side 2 with \\"Oo You\\", Paul is FINALLY starting to rock out again. Nothing wrong with getting down-home and folksy, but he was starting to veer into repetition and Granny music territory. \\"Oo You\\" is a solidly good tune, with a strong, punchy rhythm guitar track and some soulful basslines. The rock vibe continues into \\"Momma Miss America\\", the 3rd instrumental track and probably the most fully realized one so far. Decent track, but at this point in the album thejam noodles are starting to get a bit tiresome.<br /><br />\\"Teddy Boy\\" is another Beatles leftover, a bouncy, acoustic number from the \\"Get Back\\" sessions. I like this little tune, a sort of \\"Rocky Raccoon\\" spiritual sequel, and the chorus is kind of infectious. It moves right into \\"Singalong Junk\\", the 4th (!) instrumental, this time a retread of \\"Junk\\" from earlier in the album. I actually like the instrumental version MUCH better. Maybe because the lyrics are all sorts of dopey treacle.<br /><br />\\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\" is next. As mentioned earlier, it's 37 delicious flavors of awesome.<br /><br />\\"Kreen-Akrore\\" closes the album with its 5th and final instrumental. At 4:14, it's the longest (!!) song on the album. It starts with a jungle rhythm, moves into rock territory with crashing guitars and a drum solo (!!!), then into odd chanting, percussion, heavy breathing, distorted guitar licks, more drum fills, and then ends with organs and guitars in crescendo... all for nought. A disappointing ending.<br /><br />McCartney is an odd album. It's a down-home, homemade, \\"I'm gonna noodle around and see what happens\\" loose-feel project that didn't amount to a whole lot, but overall isn't a bad album. I love \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\", and really like \\"Teddy Boy\\", \\"Oo You\\", \\"Every Night\\", and \\"Singalong Junk\\". The rest of the album is OK-to-forgettable, and only \\"Kreen-Akrore\\" really stinks. If you take this album as it should be taken -- as Paul goofing around in the studio to see what he can come up with -- it's a gentle, enjoyable romp. But there's little on it that's truly lasting.<br /><br />When McCartney would get to his next album, things would be much different.

Have you ever finished a book and had to get your thoughts down on the page while your neurons were still all drowning in fireworks? Besides, it continues the theme so it's practically fate.<br /><br />Good fictional characters are real. First, they are real in the mind of the writer, then if they are well written enough and lucky to strike fire in the minds of enough readers, they become real to a whole universe of people who reread and reread their stories, who eagerly await the next book in their series, who may even-in genre fandoms where it's acceptable to wear prosthetic ears or wave dangerously pointed sticks-dress up as them and write fanfic of varying degrees of quality.<br /><br />Then there are the other characters, the redshirts, the Lieutenant Expendables, the collateral damage strewn in the wake of any action plot. Star Trek was, of course, notorious for this: redshirts were the mostly-nameless crewmen killed off in every away-mission or space battle to establish the danger faced by the main characters. The unsung, the unmourned, and now the seriously pissed off.<br /><br />Imagine being a new crewman aboard the Starship Free Enterprise, bright and shiny-new from the academy, gradually realizing that 1.) you are a character in a badly written and wildly unrealistic science fiction series, and 2.) that you're Lieutenant Expendable: the first to die to advance the plot. And there's nothing you can do about it-you're stuck on a ship where the bridge crew constantly risks themselves on away missions that in a sane universe would be performed by insanely well-trained specialists, where in every space battle the inertial dampers (which can normally keep you from feeling a thing when accelerating from 0 mph to Ludicrous Speed) will be overloaded and knock the aforementioned bridge-crew about like eggs in a basket (and nobody will ever reinvent the safety harness), and universe-shaking scientific or engineering advances will be made on the fly with bubblegum and bailing wire Just In Time To Save The Ship.<br /><br />But not on time to save a lot of nameless crewmen.<br /><br />So what are you going to do? What any worthy protagonist would do. You're going to Fix It.<br /><br />Redshirts is an amazing book on so many levels. It's sci-fi humor. It's deep deep deep meta-humor.

0307946711|4.0|One Day presents the facade of being a conventional love story reminiscent of When Harry met Sally. The story opens with Dexter and Emma, having just graduated college and spending the night together. The story then follows the lives of Dexter and Emma on the same day, July 15, everyday for the next twenty years. Dex and Em is the story of two people that the reader knows are meant to be together. One Day is more than just a romantic novel, though. One Day explores the idea of human loneliness and how we all desire to be with someone. The novel is at times funny but can also be unbearably sad and realistic. The realism of One Day is what sets this novel apart from it's contemporaries.
145160713X|3.0|I am a great admirer of Prof. Lewin's teaching, and I suspect this book reflects problems due to the editor, literary agent, and non-physicist co-author.  The book seems to be a hastily put together mash-up of three different ideas: 1) Insights into what is behind the on line lectures;  2) A first-person account of the early days of X-ray astronomy; and 3) A pre-college level \\"science is fun\\" book.<br /><br />Some parts give wonderful insights into a master teacher and researcher, and will be of great interest to anyone who has watched his video lectures. The influences of WWII in Europe on his childhood, the breakdown of his first marriage while he was emphasizing his research, and the extent that he rehearses the lectures all present a human side to this professor.<br /><br />However, most of the book is written at a level that is demeaning to anyone who has even taken high school level physics. Numerous very basic topics are brushed off with \\"this  is too complicated to explain here.\\"  If the intended audience is even freshman college-level then things like Coulomb's Law and the decibel scale can be handled by the reader. I especially note that it should not be necessary to explain that the superscript 2 beside the letter r means radius squared!<br /><br />On the other hand, if the goal is to encourage high school students to study physics, then presenting the main concepts with a comment that \\"understanding the details of how I got this result is a reason for learning calculus\\" would have been a better approach. Pre-college students need to see that science is something they can master if they study.  Accounts of fundamental X-ray physics measurements and marital relationships are beyond this audience.<br /><br />Numerous web links in the book are to images and further information located on non-archival sites, and I doubt if most of the links will still work after  a few years.  A better solution would have been a publisher-maintained web page so that web linkscould be updated as needed.

The movie seemed a little muddled but if you were already knowledgable about the John Carter series of books you would have a better understanding of the dynamics of the various factions presented in the film.  One of the scenes they deleted might have made the movie a little easier to understand. The action scenes, however, were dead on and the characters, esp. the Princess, were somewhat more fleshed out than in the books. The producers updated Deja's character to make her more in light with today's PC of a woman's capabilities.<br /><br />The movie might have been better served if the producers narrowed the focus of the film. They seemed to have tried to cover too many of the series story lines into the first film. The film was obviously meant to be the first of many to come and that aspect, which sadly based on the failure of the film seems to be quite unlikely. Fortunately, the film does manage to stand on its own.  We'll have to imagine what future stories may have been told.  SPOILER ALERT: It would have been nice to see how Mars had progressed when John Carter returned to Mars at the end of the movie.<br /><br />After reading a number of articles about how the movie came about, I think many of the weaker aspects of the movie were caused by the \\"too many chiefs\\" involved in its production. The movie should have done better in the theaters but it was hampered by a lack of a solid marketing campaign.<br />If you like action films and science fiction and fantasy I would strongly recommend this film. I will definately watch it again and will keep this one for my collection as a \\"cult classic.\\"

B0007D5FXC|5.0|Perhaps thought patterns are changing and prejudices against gay characters are indeed abating. At least hearing the audience delight after viewing STAGE BEAUTY makes a case for more mainstream male actors to shed the fear of taking on roles that feature gender and sexuality variations: Russell Crowe, Colin Farrell, Tom Hanks, Matt Damon, Antonio Banderas, Javier Bardem, Rodrigo Santoro, Gael Garcia Bernal, et al have all performed sensitively as gay men despite their macho image - the once small list is now respectably large. And now add Billy Crudup and Ben Chaplin to that ever-growing list. Bravo to that change.<br /><br />STAGE BEAUTY (in the screenplay version of his own play 'The Compleat Female Stage Beauty' by Jeffrey Hatcher) is set in the mid 17th century with all the frills and foibles of British dandies and ladies visually intact. This is the time when female roles were assumed by male actors (the theater was simply no place for ladies to participate) and we are introduced to Mr. Kynaston (in a brilliant, multifaceted performance by Billy Crudup!) as he portrays Desdemona in Shakespeare's 'Othello'. He is attended by a dresser Maria Hughes (Claire Danes, another superlative acting achievement) who longs to act and steals away after performances in the theater run by actor Betterton (Tom Wilkinson) to a tavern where she assumes the memorized roles Kynaston performs on the royally approved stage.<br /><br />Kynaston has been raised to portray women on stage (and indeed in life) and responds to men as a woman (his lover is the Duke of Buckingham - Ben Chaplin). King Charles II (a thorough-going hilarious fling for the gifted Rupert Everett) is convinced by his tart du jour to allow women to play women's roles on the stage, thus dethroning Kynaston as the actress of the time, driving him into tawdry masquerades in pubs after a severe beating from thugs beckoned by the bloated Sir Charles Sedley (Richard Griffiths). Maria Hughes thus becomes the first 'compleat female actress' and this transition between Kynaston and Maria results in desperate tutoring lessons before Maria can play Desdemona for the King. For the first time in his life Kynaston must examine his own sexuality and his successful final curtain after playing Othello to Maria's Desdemona gratefully leaves that choice up in the air.<br /><br />The script is a delight, the actors are all first rate, especially the wholly immersed Crudup and Danes who could well be part of the Royal Shakespeare Company, so fine is their British sound, demeanor, and Shakespeare! The supporting cast is a kaleidoscope of jewel-like performances from Everett, Wilkinson, Edward Fox, Hugh Bonneville among others. The mood is appropriately British - all dark, candlelit stagecraft and foggy marsh vistas - and the music matches the overall picture. Richard Eyre has directed a film that deserves many kudos, but the main glory should shine on his ability to explore the spectrum of gender and sexuality with dignity, intelligence, and tremendous sensitivity. A welcome delight! June 12at female actress' and this transition between Kynaston and Maria results in desperate tutoring lessons before Maria can play Desdemona for the King.

0307730697|5.0|I just finished reading the book Fearless by Eric Blehm. This book is simply incredible! Adam Brown, the Navy Seal who the book is about, was simply incredible! I could hardly put the book down. Adam Brown is a man to be looked up to and admired in all areas of his life. I would encourage anyone to read this book and be inspired.<br /><br />The author spent countless hours interviewing friends, family, co-workers, and others who knew Adam and he puts together a detailed look at Adam's life, both the good and the bad. That's one of the amazing things about Adam Brown. He was very clear that he wanted others to know about the failures in his life as well as the accomplishments. He wanted others to learn from the mistakes he made.<br /><br />This book highlights moments from Navy Seal Operator Brown's life from the time he was born until his death in action as a Operator in Seal Team Six, one of the most elite units in the US Military. It not only focuses on the successes in his life, but also the struggles, foremost of which was his addiction to drugs in his young adult life. This continued to be a struggle and a challenge for him throughout his life. His wife was a major influence in helping him overcome and struggle through this addiction. In return for her dedication, he returned an unwavering dedication to his wife and children as well as his country.<br /><br />The title for the book comes from the way that Chief Brown faced life, fearlessly. From a very young age, he let nothing hold him back. From jumping off the back deck at 1 or 2 years old, to jumping off bridges as a young adult, to mastering Sniper School and the elite Green Team with a maimed hand and bad eye, something which even Seals without these difficulties were often unable to accomplish. It also describes the way he faced death in action while performing his duty and protecting his teammates.<br /><br />Another key component of his life that you cannot miss in this book is his love of Jesus. He isa wonderful example of the strength, courage, compassion, and fearlessness that Christians should, but often don't, exhibit. I was so impressed with the way you could never doubt his physical strength and dedication to the task, but also his compassion. This is the reason so many of his friends and fellow operatives were willing, and excited to share the real Adam Brown for a book. They knew they could could count on him whether it was on a mission, or \\"off the clock\\" and dealing with personal issues in their lives.<br /><br />I cannot more strongly recommend this book. Adam Brown's story is simply incredible and keeps you reading whether it's talking about his struggle with drugs or about a military operation he was undertaking. You will come away with an appreciation for not only him, but for our men and women in uniform in general. About the only negative I can think of is the use of occasional strong language that stems from interviews with other military personnel. I think the book would have had just as much impact without this, but it's use was infrequent, so I would just exercise caution when allowing younger readers to read the book.<br /><br />Thank you Eric Blehm for bringing us this story. Thank you US Military for your vigilance, and thank you Adam Brown for your fearless pursuit of life and for making the ultimate sacrifice for your country.

If you love Polaroid cameras and photos as I do then this is a \\"Must Have.\\" Digital photography is wonderful but buying my first Polaroid \\"Swinger\\" was a life changing event.  The joy and anticipation of an instant photograph defined my \\"I want it now\\" generation. This books shows the work of many photographers who understood the value of the moment and appreciated the unique character of Polaroid film.  That character comes thru on every page.  It also includes a short essay on Edwin Land's meeting with Ansel Adams and a timeline of Polaroid cameras (except for the Polavision movie camera). Thanks Taschen for this and all the wonderful books you do and thanks Edwin Land.

0345803485|1.0|Not sure what the buzz is about this book that places this trilogy on the NY Times Best Seller List.  The writing wasn't done by a professional author, and the storyline was missing. Perhaps middle school or high school girls are buying this series. Save Your Money and if you must read this book, borrow it from someone.
B0051MKMNC|5.0|This is a great movie.  Bradley Cooper does a good job of playing a down and out character who makes it to the top...granted he had 'a little' help getting there. This movie has a bit of a \\"Wall Street\\" movie vibe, which I also liked. If you can get this movie for a deal then it is worth it.

This series can be read in any order although beginning the series with the first book \\"The Redbreast\\" enables the reader to keep track of reappearing characters in the series.  The Redbreast provided an overview of Sweden's situation during WWII which I had never heard of until reading this book.  Hard to put this book down once you begin reading!!

B002ZG997M|5.0|This is a great movie. It is a little over the top at times, but is very enjoyable. Yes the movie has a religious tone to it, but as someone who isn't religious I still liked it. There are easter eggs in the movie about bible verses (some of which he speaks during the film.)<br /><br />The movie illustrates how humans view religion. Some want to control the masses with it, while others want something to follow and have faith in. While the movie is violent and kinda disturbing in some parts, the whole movie isn't about that.

B003XI6VJ0|1.0|I ordered this, expecting that this was a legitimate Apple USB Power Adapter, as advertised. My order arrived quickly, and I opened it up and felt a little suspicious about the packaging, even though it came with an 'Apple' manual (without product warranty). I plugged it into my USB port and then into my ipod. The fit seemed a bit tight. The USB adapter looks the same size as the one that came with my ipod. My ipod did not make a connection to my computer. When I pulled it out it stuck, and pulled out the piece inside the casing of the ipod USB adapter (the part that plugs into the ipod). My opinion: Don't waste your money. Spend the $ Apple is asking for it's real ipod USB Adapter.

B007MJSQSK|3.0|Steven Spielberg directed this animated film about Tintin, a young reporter who enters a world of adventure on the high seas in the middle of a rather implausible inter-generational battle between good and evil. Tintin and his very intelligent dog Snowy become involved in the mystery when Tintin buys a seemingly innocuous ship model. He's immediately accosted by two others who also want the model, and after taking it home, it's stolen. Fortunately, before that a secret scroll falls out after Snowy accidentally knocks the boat over, breaking the main mast in which it is hidden. However, it soon becomes clear that Tintin's scroll contains only part of a set of clues. And so Tintin and Snowy are soon off to find the rest of the clues.<br /><br />The 'bad news' is that the film is too long and violates far too many laws of physics.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Terrible book. It is poorly written (which is my biggest pet peeve). The \\"porn\\" or \\"erotic\\" parts are repetitive and boring. This book would probably be good to a middle school boy. The publicist for this book and author should get an award for best sales job ever! I can't believe the buzz about this piece of crap. I love sequels & trilogies. Loved the Harry Potter series, the Hunger Games, The Girl With the Dragon Tatoo series. . . couldn't wait to read & finish each series. I could care less about how this trilogy goes. None of the characters are likable, believable, or relatable. No one in the book \\"speaks\\" or says anything. They all \\"whisper\\" or \\"murmur\\". They all show surprise or arousal or shock by \\"her/his eyes widened\\". So the two main characters are walking around wide-eyed and whispering. Oh and the male \\"protagonist\\" drives women crazy by the way his \\"trousers/pants hang off his hips\\". It's so bad it's laughable. So mad I paid money for this crap. This didn't even deserve 1 star; but, it's required to review.

0307730697|5.0|Man oh man; while I've been waiting on the Kingdom Man to arrive I was provided an opportunity to read this story FEARLESS.  It's a story about Adam Brown a Navy Seal who was part of the team that eventually took out Bin Laden.  I won't give away the story but just wanted to let y'all know I couldn't put the book down ... I read it in a day, yes it was that good.  While there were portions of the book that I thought could have been left out because in my opinion didn't do anything to add to the story it's a book that will definately draw you in with this guy's life.  I walked away invigorated and challenged to evaluate my own life and the things I've done as well as the things I will do.<br /><br />For those of you who face addictions; whether you are in the midst of an addiction or on the other side of it and still find struggles this story is yet another example of the redemptive power a relationship with Jesus Christ  brings.  Bottom line is that you too can overcome those addictions no matter how deep you are into them.  But you say I'm not you and you are so right, but neither are any of us Adam Brown, but the very thing that gave Adam freedom to say he wasn't afraid of anything that might happen to him on the earth, because he knew that no matter what, nothing can take his spirit from him.  The resurrection power of Jesus Christ can also make you fearless when it comes to overcoming.<br /><br />For my brothers and sisters affiliated with the military, I believe many of you may have parallel stories.  You wonder whether or not what you're doing is making a difference. Day in and day out you see things that others don't see, you train on things others couldn't even possibly imagine.  This story is another example of what strength and perseverance can do for you.  When you choose to give something back or stand up for someone who otherwise couldn't do it for themselves. Sure sometimes a thank you would be nice, but like Adam it isn't about the accolades but whatare your feelings about you.  Adam knew whose he was and that's what drove him to be who he was.<br /><br />For everyone else this is a tremendous story of a son, brother, husband, friend, dad ... I believe you will walk away with a sense of how God sees us all.  We are all rough around the edges, and yet Christ loves us with an everlasting love.  To follow Adam's journey from childhood, to addictions, to overcoming, to struggling, to persevering ... allows us all to look in the mirror and face ourselves and realize that there is something deep within us that desires to be what God has called us to be. Often times we struggle searching for that thing we were created to do.  We remain restless in this life seeking for it.  We may even stumble along the way as we try to do it in our own strength, but when we come to the understanding of who God is and that He loves us rough edges and all for His glory ... that's when it all clicks.  It doesn't mean there won't be trials but it sure means we have a soft place to land.  Just like it did for Adam; fearless will help you too become fearless for God.<br /><br />[...]

B0083GCK5G|3.0|The style of music on this album tends toward the immediate post-Pet Sounds style the Beach Boys recorded in the mid to late sixties.  This was a creative period for the band, but not commercially successful.  This new album, That's Why God Made the Radio, is rich in harmonies and has high production values; however, weak lyrics, jumbled melodies, and a lack of catchy choruses make this effort unremarkable.<br /><br />It's good to see the surviving members recording again, and hopefully they will continue to work on future albums and produce something special.

The TV cut will be on a DVD disc for both format releases.<br /><br />Now don't start getting rid of your 30th AE just yet! Although the CE is pretty awesome and includes the Deleted (TV) Scene and Alternate Ending via the TV Cut, it misses out on the movie documentary Terror In The Aisles, so you're gonna want to hold on to it.

After years of infighting the remaining founding members of The Beach Boys, namely Brian Wilson, Mike Love and Al Jardine along with Bruce Johnston and David Marks have embarked on a 50th anniversary tour and recorded a terrific new studio album dubbed \\"That's Why God Made The Radio\\".  Although I am always a bit leery of new albums by aging rockers I found this one to be an absolute delight.  For me it was kind of like stumbling into \\"The Time Tunnel\\".  But I must tell you that I enjoyed every minute of it.<br /><br />In my view \\"That's Why God Made The Radio\\" proves to be something of a hybrid.  My ears tell me that this disc is kind of a blend of the hit-making, singles-oriented Beach Boys of the 1960's with the much more serious incarnation of the group that gave us such memorable albums as \\"Sunflower\\", \\"Surf's Up\\" and \\"Holland\\" a decade or so later.  Although I loved the Top 40 stuff I think I enjoyed those albums even more.  \\"That's Why God Made The Radio\\" offers up a dozen freshly-minted Beach Boys classics.  Brian Wilson had a hand in writing all but one of these songs, the only exception being \\"Daybreak Over The Ocean\\" which was penned by Mike Love.  Brian Wilson has certainly not lost his knack for writing catchy tunes and The Beach Boys remain one of the tightest vocal groups on the scene today.<br /><br />Just imagine how cool it would be this summer to enjoy a Beach Boys tune while messing around on the beach with your grandkids on a radio station that they normally listen to.  Although that might sound like a long shot there are certainly a few tunes on this disc that have the potential to become a hit single.  \\"Spring Vacation\\", \\"The Private Life of Bill and Sue\\" and \\"Beaches in Mind\\" immediately came to mind for me.  I understand that Capitol has already released the title tune as a single.  While I am at it I would also like to recommend a couple of other songs including \\"Strange World\\" and \\"Isn't It Time\\" that I really enjoyed.  As far as I am concerned there really is not a bad track on this album.<br /><br />Now my head is telling me that \\"That's Why God Made The Radio\\" is a solid four star offering.  However, my heart is telling me to give this album five stars which by the way I have decided to do.  I guess I am just a sentimental fool at heart.  \\"That's Why God Made The Radio\\" is a well-conceived and highly entertaining album that will be enjoyed at beaches and cookouts throughout the summer of 2012 and beyond. The more you hear it the more you are going to love it. Long live The Beach Boys! It's great to see them back in the game.

B00004W50Z|5.0|This album/CD brought back many memories of my high school years. This is probably one of The Bands greatest albums of all time.
0765316994|4.0|This was a clever, funny, interesting novel worth multiple reads. The density of the humor both varies from spoof to meta and I kept thinking about the Community Timelines episode. The Coda's were also a nice addition that rounded out the piece. I am already planning to give this a good, deep reread.<br /><br />That said, it is a short, quick read. Almost more of a novella than a novel. This isn't in and of itself a bad thing; personally I think there are plenty of novels that could use some serious editing. There are wonderful novels like \\"Needle\\" that are short and sweet.  However, $11.99 for the ebook of this brevity seems a little high.

B004FOA84A|4.0|I really enjoyed the style of this game. The puzzles were fun and the graphics were pretty good. The only issue I have is that it is way to short. Worth the dollar I paid and at least the whole family can play. If you like mysteries and puzzles then I highly recommend this game.

B000LTAY1U|4.0|I own a few Seiko watches, some Kinetic, some just automatic. This is a lightweight, durable watch that keeps reasonable time. It's not a chronograph and it's not a Kinetic, so don't expect it to run for more than a day or so if you aren't wearing it, and it will run slower if the battery doesn't have an adequate charge. I like this watch, I'm glad I bought it, and I would recommend it as it is easily worth 2-3 times what you're going to pay.

B007URVZJ6|5.0|I am a new author with no luck for publishing in paper. Owing my friend's encouragement and kind advise, I have discovered Amazon kindle self-publishing option electronically. With a clear and step-by-step instructive help of \\"Building Your Book for Kindle\\" it is made into a great solution for any authors that are new in the world of publicity and do not yet have the sought support by publishers. Amazon's offered chat-service works perfect too to compliment the process.
B007MDQW3W|5.0|First, this is a great album for both the first-timer and the hardcore fans.<br /><br />Second, yet, it sounded like a return of familiar Regina. Compared with 'Far', there is not much new, until you listen to 'Open': This is a new vocal and mental exploration. Her voice expands far and high and warmly wrap everything within its reach as if she sings in the Pantheon. It'll unlock your perception about human being and boundary of your self-consciousness.<br /><br />In an interview, she hesitated to explain her song in a detail saying that the point is to feel it, not to explain it. You can understand only by listening to it.<br /><br />I'm at a pretty rough time in my life now. Honestly, I feel the happiest when I listen to this album in my car. There's nothing like it.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|There was a lot of hype coming into this season, since I came in having watched the first 3 seasons on Netflix, and not watching this when it was on TV, I was excited to finally own and watch the fourth season.  Seeing Walt transform from the underappreciated high school chemistry teacher with cancer to the crystal meth kingpin is really fun to watch!  I enjoyed this season a lot because it got a little darker in the storyline, Walt became even more of a badass, and it leads up well and gets you guessing for what they will do with the final season of Breaking Bad, season 5.  I personally liked the 3rd season a little more because of Hank's character being more prevalent and entertaining, but that's just me.  This is a fantastic season nonetheless and if you loved seasons 1-3, you will surely love this season as well!
B00204AA0O|5.0|What a great work! It gets better as you listen. If listen carefully and comparatively, you'll notice she brought a lot of progress with this album compared with all the other ones without sacrificing her brilliance. Listen to Regina like you have never heard.<br />My fave is 'Folding Chair', the dolphin song,
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Since everyone I talked to was in love with the movie, I decided to read the books first.  The Hunger Games is a book unlike anything I have read before.  Great plot with unexpected twists and turns.  There are some graphic depictions of violence and death, but the story is great.
0439023491|4.0|Just when you thought things would change for the better, you were wrong.  Catching Fire by Suzanne Collins is the second book in the Hunger Games trilogy, an enthralling, and positively addictive series that keeps everyone on the edge of their seat.  The second book takes you on a journey through Katniss, the main character's life after surviving the 74th annual Hunger Games. The Districts are going through a time of unrest and want to revolt, and Katniss finds herself at the head of that revolution.  Katniss and her fellow \\"tribute\\" Peeta were both able to survive because of Katniss' wits and strength. Katniss' life has been a struggle since the beginning, but this book truly shows the reader how strongly Collins values perseverance and ambitions.  Her goal was to show readers how rewarding it is to work for something and appreciate everything you have because you never know what you have until it is gone.<br /><br /> Collins, a very gifted writer might I add, may strongly believe that the world is headed toward a society where every aspect of people's lives are controlled by the government.  Her purpose in writing Catching Fire was to show readers that a revolution may be on its way, and living by one person's standards is not right.  Collins, the daughter of a U.S. Air Force officer most likely grew up moving around and experiencing different cultures in different places, which may have influenced her while writing her unusual fictional story.  Some parts of her story have strong similarities to George Orwell's 1984, another amazing and wildly popular fictional novel.<br /><br /> To support her argument that society is headed to a place where every aspect of people's lives will be controlled by the government, Collins writes in her novel, \\"I can't let President Snow condemn me to this. Even if it means taking my own life. Before that, though, I'd try to run away\\" (Collins, 44).  Katniss is saying that she does not want to let the government control who she marries and loves, which helps prove Collin's point.<br /><br /> Suzanne Collins uses some strong evidence to prove her argument is corrects, but she does not use much counter evidence.  If someone were to ask her why she believes society is headed to where it is headed, she may be able to back herself up, but for the most part, her fictional story uses some strong evidence to prove she is right.<br /> The book's argument is convincing at times, but I found that the previous book Hunger Games, did a lot more to prove to the reader why our society is headed in a bad direction. Throughout the book, Collins writes of people wanting to rebel, and she writes \\"As the Peacekeepers fell... there was hope that this had not been an act of madness, that in some way, if they could get the word out to other districts, an actual overthrow of the government in the Capitol might be possible\\" (Collins, 104).  These small statements help prove to the reader that uprisings were forming everywhere, and nobody ever gave up hope, which in turn supports her argument that we should not let society head in that direction.<br /><br /> As I stated before, this book has striking similarities with the book 1984 by George Orwell.  The utopian setting and telescreens from 1984 are almost exactly the same as the \\"reaping\\" in Catching Fire, in which everyone is forced to watch the giant screen in the middle of town.  Another book that has a similar plot to this book is a book called The Host by Stephanie Myer. Although it is more of a love story, this book is placed in a dystopian society and it creates a feeling in the reader that society is not headed in a good direction.<br /><br /> All in all, Catching Fire was a great read.  Although it wasn't as exciting as the first book the Hunger Games, it was still able to keep me on the edge of my seat wondering what miracle was going to hit Katniss next.  This book mixes just the right amount of action with love, which in my opinion is one of the biggest reasons why I liked this book.  I would recommend this book to anyone 13+ because it is slightly violent, and there are some challenging concepts that may be hard for anyone younger to grasp, but there is a wonderful story behind it all and this book takes you to a whole other world.sons why I liked this book.

B005LAIGZU|5.0|I never write reviews but I had to write a review on this item because it was the best movie I have ever seen.  Right now we need a little more patriotism in this country and a little better understanding of what our troops are doing everyday to protect our country and what it stands for.  This movie goes on the same movie shelf as \\"Saving Private Ryan,\\" \\"The Patriot,\\" and other movies that leave you thinking and being a better person then when you went in.  I give this a hearty five stars because it deserves no less!

0865478570|4.0|When I was in college in the 1960s, all history majors who expected to make a career in the field had to be competent in French and/or German (plus Latin if medieval studies was your thing). And, of course, I had taken a couple years of French as a high school graduation requirement. Even though I lived in Europe for much of the 1950s, learning foreign languages in the classroom has always been difficult for me, and I struggled. These days, though, it's uncommon for American students to be required to take another language even as undergraduates -- a result of the worldwide prevalence of English since World War II.<br /><br />In fact, life on this planet would have been a lot more peaceful if humans had always spoken the same language. Until relatively recently, people dealt with the problem of Babel by simply learning more languages, those of their neighbors or trading partners, or of their conquerors. And certain languages -- Greek, then Latin, French, German, Russian to a certain extent, and now English -- have become dominant in science and in international affairs, so that anyone who wanted to succeed outside his immediate surroundings knew which language he had to acquire. But the notion of a professional bilingualist who would act as an intermediary between two people without a common language has only been around for a couple hundred years. Bellos was not raised bilingual -- he only learned French in school, like everyone else. But he has a knack for translating English books into French (translators hardly ever work from a \\"foreign\\" language back to their native tongue) and has been teaching the theory and practice, and indeed the art, of translation for some time, most recently at Princeton. This book is his attempt to get the reader to consider the issues behind the conversion of thoughts and ideas from one language to another, and he's quite successful most of the time. Which is to be preferred, a literal translation, or preferring the sense over the exact words? Is it even possible to translate something \\"literally\\"? How does oral translation (as in tribal societies or at the UN) differ from written, literary translation? (There's a great deal of difference, it appears.) How does difference in social and cultural context affect translated meaning? (Is a Chinese-speaker going to understand the same thing by \\"democracy\\" as a European?) How does translation affect such international matters as the law? Is it possible to really translate a joke? The author is an excellent explainer, using original examples to get his point across and to make the reader pause and consider. (He even sees the film _Avatar_ as \\"a parable about translation.\\") I would strongly recommend this book to anyone who ever has dealings with native speakers of other languages, or who must learn another language himself, or who reads literature that has been translated from a different original language. In short, almost any educated person in modern America -- and almost any ordinary, self-aware person outside the isolated and parochial sections of the United States.ct words?

B007J4T2G8|4.0|Ok, so the phrasing is unrealistic since its both repetitive and very British when the book is supposed to be about Americans in Washington State. Yes you have to read about eyerolling, flushing, gasping and his gray gaze over and over. Yes, you have to read about Ana's inner goddess and inner subconcious (personally I thought that was funny and would make a great part to a movie or series when put onto the screen) I have heard all of the stuff about how its like Twilight, because of course it started out as Twilight fanfiction and was released online a chapter at a time, which explains why its repetitive. Besides the Washington part and thier haircolor, and maybe that she is supposedly clumbsy and doesn't like fashion, this book couldn't be further from Twilight. The character's personalities are completely exclusive to Christian and Ana. The story is completely different and there is nothing paranormal about the story whatsoever. If you just relax, throw away any cynicism and enjoy the book, its pretty great. Lets face it, who is reading this book for literary value? Its extremely addicting and sexy. The whole center of this book revolves around Mr. Grey wanting to turn the 21 year old virgin Ana into his submissive sex slave and so it might scare off some readers, but really its kind of mild. They end up having more \\"vanilla\\" sex than anything, although I heard it gets a little kinkier in book 2. What really kept me going was the humor and the suprizingly tender love story between two people who are so different and yet so drawn to each other. I loved seeing how Ana turned the cold and powerful Mr. Grey into a man who realizes that all he really wants is her. Call me corny, but I even got butterflies when Christian turned up. Yeah, he's a bit of a stalker, but its almost refreshing that the author is able to bring these two together even during circumstances that would usually be off limits for reality. He's rich, can play piano, is the CEO of his own corp., is good looking and has a large penis, but really like I said before, it just adds to the candy that is the entertainment value of this book. Its not going to be read in classrooms in 50 years, but I sure enjoyed it.ood looking and has a large penis, but really like I said before, it just adds to the candy that is the entertainment value of this book.

B007MAETA8|5.0|From the moment my sister turned me on to \\"Where The Light Is\\" because of one song that sounded to her like the blues only I would love, I have invested myself in owning every CD John has put out, sometimes choosing music over food or gas in the car.  Every life has a soundtrack and in my 5th decade, my soundtrack is heavily peppered with the songs of John Mayer.  I can identify with him because each song feels like he crawled around in my head and read my diaries.  He sings what I am too tongue tied to say to a point where I can plug in Born & Raised and lay down in the melodies like a thick ticking mattress and still dream the dreams of my youth and hold fast to the promises of my future.  John is THAT GOOD.  What makes Born & Raised even more perfect is knowing that though throat problems forced him off the road for a season, his poetic mind kept speaking for him.  It is a bit reminiscent of the Eagles I devoured my senior year (the year John was born) and a lot of a James Taylor feel is there but in the way you pull on a pair of butter soft blue jeans and ride to no particular destination with the softness of the melodies floating from the speakers in your car.  John has a gift that God does not hand out lightly.  I've seen interviews where he came on to promote the album without being able to sing a note of a single song on it due to his throat problems and the earnestness in his expression as he spoke softly about the musical turn this album has taken pulled at me to go with him just to see what we'd find together.  I'm glad I took that trip.  This is a must have to every Mayer collection for the very differentness of it if for no other reason.

B000Y7U98W|5.0|Great science fiction (at least in my humble opinion) should include at least somewhat plausible science, but should so provide the audience something more, something emotional.  This film's premise is mind-bending, and fascinating from a science perspective, but it is its commentary on the human spirit and philosophy that makes it truly remarkable.  Without giving away too much, I will say that this movie was absolutely beautiful, lyrical, poignant, and ultimately uplifting, and touched me in a way I havent' been touched by a film in a long time.<br /><br />As per the film's brief description, the main plot revolves around our sun dying, and a group of astronauts are strapped to the back of a stellar bomb in an attempt to \\"re-ignite the sun\\", \\"create a star within a star\\".  This film was not made with a huge budget, yet the filmmakers use their money very jucidiously, and were able to present some beautiful special effects shots that contributed greatly to telling the story, not just to look pretty.  Watching this film you immediately understand how deadly the sun's heat is, and how crucial it is for everyone (and everything vulnerable) to stay in the shadow of the solar shield built at the head of the spacecraft.  I appreciated how elegantly and clearly all these concepts were conveyed to the audience so that you can understand exactly what is going on, and feel the very real tension of the story.<br /><br />Stylistically this film is a true work of beauty and art.  The design of the film was superb and striking.  I loved the use of gold and black throughout the film, especially the look of the spacesuits and the Icarus spacecraft itself.  The music was also particularly well-done and haunting.  All-in all I just felt like the film was very polished, well-put together, and did not feel like a low-budget sundance movie at all, yet it had the sophistication and depth of an arthouse movie.  There was obviously a great amount of care, effort, and talent applied to thelook/feel/sound of this film, and the outcome is gorgeous.<br /><br />The acting is understated but superb by all involved, especially Rose Byrn, Chris Evanson, and Cillian Murphy.  The desparation and growing tension of the crew is palpable.  The audience feels like we are right there with them, aboard Icarus 2, hurtling towards both death and salvation.  There is a great subtext of science vs. religion, faith vs. delusion, and hope vs. despair interwoven into the film.  The twist in the 2nd act was terrifying.  The ending was sublime and metaphysical.  All in all, a great time was had watching this film.  I finished watching \\"Sunshine\\" feeling...complete.  There are lines in the film that haunt me and will stay with me.  I don't have anything bad to say about this very underrated film.  Definitely one of my favourites of all time, and one of the best science fiction movies of all time.

0525478817|5.0|After hearing excellent reviews from my friends and associates alike, I couldn't resist picking up this book. John Green is one of those authors who has received a great deal of praise but someone whose books I'd never had the pleasure of sitting down with. However, once I started to read this book, I became instantly hooked. Green utilizes his wittiness to craft realistic and deep characters whose interactions are fascinating for fictional people. He's also successful in making what would seem like serious settings (such as the church where Hazel has her vapid support group) into a place where the character can comment with something horrible, often funny, unmistakably true, and relevant to our own world. The introduction of Augustus does nothing but add to the fun, as he combined with Hazel's skeptical view on life and death and cancer is enhanced with his own insightful judgements. Every new twist brings out the wonderful humour in the pair, which, overall, makes the book extremely entertaining and never lacking in substance. If you have not experienced a written masterpiece by the potent John Green, The Fault In Our Stars is an excellent one to start with, and will almost definitely draw you to his other works, which are just as memorable, changing, and, in every possible sense of the word, wondrous.

The only reason I ever got around to reading it was because I was bored out of my skull, and looking for something to read. I saw this book, remembered NORTHANGER ABBEY, and decided to read the reviews. It looked decent, so I gave it a try.<br /><br />I couldn't put this book down! I stayed up till 11:00 p.m. reading it! Normally I go to bed at 8:30 to 9:00. And just to give you a better idea of how much I liked it, I read it in two days. This is not a \\"short read.\\"<br /><br />Jane Austen has a skill in making characters come to life. I have been able to connect with each and every one of her heroines, though Elizabeth in PRIDE AND PREJUDICE is too contemptous of others. Her books give an idea of the value placed in rank back then. It makes one glad for the semi-equality in the modern world. I loved the dialogues, and Mary, Anne's sister is so ridiculous you want to laugh.<br /><br />Anne falls in love with a poor sailor, Captain Wentworth, but is persuaded that she can make a much better match. She spends the next eight years regretting this decision, and wishing she had followed her better instincts. Captain Wentworth makes his fortune, but his pride is too much damaged to return to Anne. Fate throws them together again in the end as Anne's father rents their house to the Crofts, close relations to Captain Wentworth, and they begin to see each other much more often than they are comfortable with. I will let you discover what happens next, as one review spoiled it all for me.<br /><br />I have now broadened my knowledge of Jane Austen's novels. All of them are very good. My favorite would be PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, and my least favorite NORTHANGER ABBEY. I would give all of them five stars, though.
B006FO3ERQ|5.0|When I finished reading Richard Ford's previous best-seller, \\"The Lay of the Land,\\" I entered his name somewhere on the internet so I would be informed when his next book would be published.  I waited and waited and finally heard May 22 would be the big day.  It arrived, at midnight or thereabouts on the twenty-third, delivered on my Kindle.  I consumed it over the next few days and loved it.  Not only his story, but Ford's way of telling his story.  From Ford you get more than a story.  He ambles life and humanity, the good and the bad, the in-between.  He makes you think and spends time thinking along with you.  He sort of cruises with the story, gazing off-camera up, then maybe off to the right or the left instead of staring at you through the mirror of a teleprompter, if you know what I mean.  I love his work and can't wait till his next arrival.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|I like this game but I have trouble visiting friends. I am stuck on this one goal because I am having trouble visiting friends.

0345803485|3.0|This book seems to me to be an x-rated \\"Twilight\\" but without all of the glittery vampire bullcrap.  I do not for one moment believe that there is a such thing as a 27 year old beautiful, French speaking, airplane flying male billionaire out there.  I also do not believe for one moment that girls can orgasm that much, especially while losing her virginity.  But what do I know?! I must never have dated the right men!<br /><br />What I do know is that I do not usually read this style of book.  And yet? It had me hooked and wanting to read more. Especially since while I was reading it, I was pretty much was envisioning me in place of Ana and Bradley Cooper as Christian.<br /><br />This is a true work of fiction that I found myself shaking my head at times because of a) refer to my opening paragraph b)the style of writing c) the British terms/sayings when this is supposed to be a story written about Americans' living in America d) these Americans' drinking tea out of teacups and saucers (I might have to pull out my grandmother's teacups and saucers and start doing this now).  I'll stop now and not go one.<br /><br />Even with everything listed through out what I'm writing, I still read the entire book and liked it.  Couldn't stop reading it, in fact. If you like brainless, quick reads that have you hooked, lined and sinkered, this is the story for you.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this game because you can choose a winning deal. I love to win and it makes me happy that I can get a setting where I can every time! very satisfied!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Love the three books!!Got them on my Kindle app for my ipad. I even went to EL James's website and found out that she has a playlist of the music she mentions in the book on YOUTUBE! What a great idea. Now I'm reading the set again with the music in the background. Pure genius! I normally stick to reading business books, so this was completely out of left field for me. However, I'm so glad I took the detour. Total pleasure to be transported to such a place that Ms. EL James creates. I only wish she keep writing. I want more stories...
0062082353|3.0|God 1st, Country 2nd, Family 3rd is how the author rates his priorities. I wonder what God thinks about him killing people who consider Americans as invaders of their homeland? Apparently the author has little idea what God is all about if he understands hypocrisy.
0896898288|5.0|I have recently received this book and am looking forward to starting on the project.  I like how it comes with a CD to print the templates from your computer without having to trace them.  I am looking forward to reading this book, because I am a farmer's wife :)
0307592731|4.0|This is an interesting read! Cheryl was brave and crazy to hike alone with so little knowledge and experience. Great Adventure!
0345529057|5.0|Books came packaged well, with the box only having a small dent. Books themselves were pristine, no page errors (checked as soon as they came in, after reading reviews). The books are mass market paperbacks, so very small and thick. I barely creased the spine speeding through A Game of Thrones, and haven't yet creased A Clash of Kings. My only wish would be that the box to contain the books was of a stiffer cardboard, but oh well.<br /><br />Content-wise, amazing. I had meant to only read during specific times of the day, mainly when my kids were asleep and the household cleaning was done, but I found myself reading when the kids were busy and reading during my breaks at work. Currently less than 200 pages shy of finishing A Clash of Kings.<br /><br />Very satisfied!
B005K17RU0|5.0|great app. User friendly. good info.<br /><br />the maps are neat and really nice graphics. I recommend this app over other weather spps
0451450523|5.0|I first saw the film The Last Unicorn when I was a young teenager, and didn't think much of it. Years later I chanced it again, and fell in love. As always, I'm tardy to the party, and only just purchased the book recently, and I am so happy the film is almost word for word with the book!<br /><br />I don't know why it makes me so gleeful that \\"Have a taco!\\" is canon, but it does!
B001BKG9RQ|5.0|My wife saw this on TV and refused to delete it from our DVR, so I had to get her this CD, so she could enjoy it at home, in her car and at her work.  A very good Gilmour album.  A must have for any real David Gilmour fan!!!!
B0055PGUYU|5.0|A very insightful book full of ways to practically change your habits for the better. A must read for anyone who wants to create successful habits.
B000002P72|5.0|Had this on vinyl back in my college years,(a long time ago), and when I came across it on Amazon, I decided I needed to get it on CD, so as to enjoy it at home, in my car, and at work.  One of the best B.B. King LP ever made.  If you like this album, then you'll also enjoy The Best of B.B. King, from the 70's, also available on CD now.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Love love loved this book. Finished whole series in about 1 week. Book downloaded very fast. I had no problems with the purchase at all.
B004L79VUI|5.0|I have always enjoyed any Robbie Robertson album and have most of them, so when I heard a few different tracks of this on Sirius radio, I knew I needed to buy it.  I was not disappointed!!  I never saw The Band, but have seen all of the members in solo performances.  Robbie Robertson and Rick Danko were always my favorites!!!!!
1603427244|5.0|I have been knitting for over 60 years, and this is a really good little reference book to keep next to you while knitting.  A great number of different techniques for both casting on/binding off.  Name is a real description of the contents!  I'd recommend this to both experienced knitters and begnners.
B0000070XV|5.0|I have this on the original LP version and pretty much wore it out!  One very good John Lee Hooker CD that features many guest  performers like Van Morrison and Charlie Musselwhite.  I have more than a few John Lee Hooker albums but this is one of my favorites!!
B0027MJU00|5.0|This book lured me in and kept me guessing until nearly the end. Despite the fact that all of the characters  are not likable, the book engaged me.  It was not until I was halfway into the story that I started having empathy for Libby Day - the sole survivor of a murderous rampage that left her mother and older sisters dead. Her older brother was convicted of the crime and has sent more than two decades in prison; but - as with the Menendez brother, her brother Ben has his female defenders that are willing to pay for information to set him free.<br /><br />Libby is a damaged soul. Anyone who had experienced what she did would be equally damaged. However, she begins to question whether she was manipulated by the prosecutor and child psychiatrists that encouraged her to testify against her brother. She believes in her brother''s guilt, but needs money and will exploit those willing to pay her to question other potential witnesses.<br /><br />The book is for the most  part well written and I would readily read another by the same author. The story moves from present day to flash backs with narratives by Libby, her dead mother and her  brother Ben - with a retelling of the day of the murders almost by the hour. It is hard to believe that a single family could have experienced such a perfect storm of disaster in just one day...but there are true stories equally unbelievable. And one thing I've learned through my personal experience....truth is  stranger than fiction....so- the story, in it's own way, is plausible.<br /><br />I liked it.I kept reading even though I was supposed to be working. I am a bit sad I've finished. There is no better testimony than that!
B000002KOO|5.0|This is the last good Fleetwood Mac album featuring Peter Green.  I have this on original LP but pretty much wore it out.  Gettting this CD was a must!!  Not a bad tune on the entire album, it really rocks the blues.  I listen to this CD quite regularly, it's that good!!
B0088RQ4X4|4.0|I too was led astray by the critical panning this movie received.  This is a good movie with a tight story line, entertaining special effects,  filled with slight drama, and a few plot twists.<br />Have spent a far worse couple of hours.  Just don't get how the book afficiandos hated this movie.  Burroughs wrote entertaining stories - but it would be a stretch to screen them all and create a franchise about John Carter.  This movie was good and its pace was such that it did not seem too long. Enjoyable for all and a lesson that one should not believe everything the critics say. This flick, apparently was dead in the water before it ever screened - a shame, because this movie is what going to movies is all about - a fun ride!
0345803485|4.0|This was a very good book, the author is a really great writer who adds humor to the story.  The sex was a bit overdone, you can get the idea without so many scenes. The characters are very likable.  I am hoping for more of a plot in the next book of the trilogy.
B0000VCZKW|5.0|good film for all ages... watch it with your kids, nieces or nephews.  devito is hilarious.  its a classic. must own.
B00881VLCE|5.0|great game love the pictures chosen only one problem it takes forever to load . other than that perfect play it every day
B007ZRZF8I|5.0|great artistic quality and animation. definitely above average production value. not the most original concept but they do it better then the rest and looks good and plays smoother too.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|I love this game. Just remember how gravity works and you'll do fine. It's a good way to exercise your brains.
B0068TJLSY|3.0|This movie was a nostolgic, but uninspired mash up of older summer blockbusters like Cloverfield, Stand By Me, and ET. The characters were transparent and under developed, the alien monster completely unfrightening and non-threatening, the plot loosely tied together. When the movie mercifully ended, I was left thinking \\"Is that it? really?\\".  I can't award half stars, but I would give it a 2.5.
B002SRQ214|5.0|This was an upgrade from a Sempron 140, Asus M4N68T-M and 4GB of Memory, running Win7 64bit, ATI Radeon 6570 Video Card was updated before the processor upgrade. My son was playing League of Legends and was getting 6 fps which immediately shot up to 60 fps after the CPU upgrade. It was well worth the upgrade when it comes to increasing performance and it has been stable. No overclocking stock fan, temp stays between 39 C and 31 C. He uses this for skype video conferencing, multi-player gaming. Everything has improved greatly.
B0088TG252|3.0|A movie with a lot of pace but not as much of a plot. Well acted and the cinematography is almost as good although a bit over the top with its lurid coloring. Scriptwriting and directing is  competent at best. Those who write that this film isn't at the level of the Bourne trilogy are indeed not telling lies. A lot of rough edges in the script and the movie jerks about while the Bourne films flowed. The violence and consequences shown in the Bourne films are copied but not mastered. The film is dirty and grey-edged in feel but it doesn't come clean on ideas. Great acting from Washington, Reynolds, Farmiga, Shephard and especially from Brendan Glesson, one of my favorites. But the same care doesn't extend to the script or it's direction. The stadium scenes are among the best in recent action movies and rival those of the Bourne films but Safe House lags as it wheezes and gasps into the final chapter and fizzles at the end. Three stars.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I found Catching Fire to be the best of the Hunger Games trilogy.  Suzanne Collins's style of writing makes you want to keep reading.  (I read all three in less than a week.)  I saw the Hunger Games movie before reading any of the books, so reading the first was a breeze, and the last was a little predictable, but Catching Fire made me want to stop and talk to people about it!
0062060562|4.0|I read it in 2 days.  The story kept unfolding and kept my attention. Although it ended abruptly and I really do not know what happened, I let my imagination finish the story.  Excellent, easy read.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|unlike some reviews complaining about needing wifi to play on kindle fire I don't have that problem. as far as the ads go, maybe they will go away if you turn off wifi. my only complaint is that I have all 3 stars in all levels, and all golden eggs, and am at a standstill because of surf n turf levels 16+ &quot;coming soon&quot;... when???
B00846TTDG|3.0|PROPAGANDA. This flick is a complete distortion of reality.  If they placed it in a fictional world it may have worked, but as it stands it is just another mass mind control tool.
B0086700CM|5.0|it is one if the most awesome games I have ever purchaced and the factor that its free is really cool
B005LAIH3G|5.0|Dont listen to anyone about this movie being bad........ its great fun with surprisingly good 3D!!!!!  It has better acting than starwars ep I&II and deja thoris is fun to look at as a bonus! I hope they make some sequels.
0345803485|4.0|I love this book , it comfortable to read and it came in great conditions !! the only problem is that you have to be careful where you ut it because since its a soft cover book the pages can bend, but other than that its good ! no complaints :)
B005NF2UE6|1.0|I used to be a big fan that is until this CD,When most groups are putting out 50 or 60 minute cd's this one is only 45 minutes and each song sounds exactly like the last cd,a few songs of his girlfriend \\"Doing Him\\" and a few drinking songs that are meant to be played in a stadium while the audience drunkenly sings along.Now that's generally not a bad thing but it sounds as if they were rushed into the studio and were told to just make the same thing and hurry up about it we need you on the road again.These guys are not maturing at all songs played really fast about drinking and going to strip clubs and getting oral gratification are a little boring,seriously guys grow up a little your not 20 years old anymore you should have had enough big boobs and brews already to move on a little bit.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Loved this movie.  I had seen some of the Iron Man movies but hadn't seen Captain America or Thor when we went.  I was not disappointed.  There was so much action that I want to see it again because I know that I missed something.<br /><br />I can't wait for the DVD to release.
B006RUJST6|5.0|There's a lot of emotion in this book. I laughed and cried - and not many books do that to me. I've read both Slammed and POR twice and will probably read them again. I loved Will and Lake and Julia :) I wish there were more books in the series.
B000000W94|5.0|Too bad Gary Moore is no longer with us. This CD, from the 90's, prooves once more why Gary Moore is admired all over the world, even without being exactly a huge commercial success. Of course he had a few hits that played extensively on the radio, but he, as a musician, deserved much more. A wonderful guitar player, he tell us about this album with detailed liner notes and all the lyrics for the songs. For blues aficionados and Gary Moore fans, this is a must buy!
0545265355|5.0|The Hunger Games trilogy was amazing!! The writing was excellent, the feeling Suzanne Collins put into the characters was so real and deeply felt. I loved Katniss Everdeen's character. There was so much weaved into this story. So much under the surface. The Hunger Games were the Capitol's way of saying, 'This is what we can do to you, so don't you dare rebel against us'. Katniss sacrificing herself for Prim, Peeta loving her, the triangle of Gale, Kantiss and Peeta, the other tributes who were victors in Catching Fire, the monster President Snow and the secret of District 13 all combined to create a series that had my head spinning for days after finishing it. This was an excellent series, the kind that you never want to end. You just want it to go on forever.
B0007ZEO4G|5.0|This is the first title from the band Deep Purple, with David Coverdale on vocals and the always amazing Glenn Hughes on bass and vocals. Let me say that this is my favorite line up of this band. This special edition was remastered and the result was incredible; sound is louder and clearer than previous editions of this CD! One never-before released track, totally instrumental (just like \\"A200\\"), very good in my oppinion, and four other songs recorded in slightly different versions are the bonuses. A great vibe throughout the entire album. For Deep Purple and Glenn Hughes fans, this is a must buy!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|One of the best apps I have downloaded. I am able to store recipes, important papers or really anything I want. It also stores pictures just as easy. Execllent app.
B005EGXTEE|5.0|\\"Here's some advice. Stay alive.\\"  Such is the tip 16-year-old Katniss Everdeen obtains from her coach, Haymitch Abernathy. But Haymitch is no conventional coach. He has the occupation of training the contestants from his district for... The Hunger Games. Each year, 24 contestants, one boy and one girl from each of the twelve districts, are chosen by random lottery to partake in a fight-to-the-death event, which is broadcasted live for entertainment by the Capitol. The Hunger Games, by Suzanne Collins, tells Katniss' story, as she joins with Peeta Mellark as the District 12 competitors to fight it out. Only one will make it out alive.<br /><br />As someone who generally doesn't read teenage novels, I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised with The Hunger Games. A novel about about twenty four teenagers competing in an annual fight-to-the-death event isn't what I would generally place on my reading list. But even I found it difficult at times to read with a critical mind and not become completely engrossed in the story. Marking the comparisons between the Gamemakers and the media today was thought-provoking and new to me. I delighted in getting to know the characters and feel that Collins has plenty to work with in her next novel.<br /><br />I would recommend that parents of children younger than the age of thirteen read the novel themselves first, and use the knowledge that they have of their children's capacity to handle violence to decide whether The Hunger Games is an appropriate read for them. But for most cases, I highly recommend this novel to those-especially in the young adults' audience- who enjoy science fiction and a well developed story.

1401937519|5.0|I have bought this book for myself, my parents and a group of my friends.  I have always thought of God and the world the way Anita has so eloquently described it.  Can't recommend it enough.  I rarely buy books and the first time I read this, it was on my Nook. I wanted a hard copy for myself so I could underline my favorite parts and make notes and go back and look at it again and again...  A rare event for me.  I barely have enough time to read a book ONCE, much less multiple times but I HAD to have this one!
B00881VLCE|4.0|really like this app. easy to view and play. would have been a 5 if fit screen better and wasn't so hard to get last few pieces. otherwise liked!

B002JWD6AS|5.0|When I first read the book I  thought its was pretty boring and returned it to the library. Then I checked it out at the library again a year later and fell for it hard. The way Grace loves Sam and is willing to keep him forever. As I read it, I didn't want to put it down for a whole week. I read in the car, at school, and in restaurants. When my friends saw me read it they all did the same and fell in love with it right away!! I &lt;3 the Wolves of Mercy Fall!!!!!

B005LAIHSG|4.0|Snow White and the Huntsman is a refreshing look at movie fairly tales, much closer to the literary stories than the sanitized Disney versions. The film keeps the basic story of an evil witch and the purity of Snow White while adding a sinister forest with a deadly troll and an enchanted fairy inhabited forest.  The dwarves are also part of the film, played by Ian McShane, Ray Winstone, Bob Hoskins and Toby Jones, among others, filmed in close-ups with dwarf stand-ins used for long shots.  They provide comic relief and fight heroically for Snow White.<br /><br />Charlize Theron as Ravenna gives a marvelous performance as Snow White's evil stepmother, who kills her husband King Magnus on their wedding night and seizes the throne for herself.  She clearly relished the role. On the other hand, Chris Helmsworth (as the Huntsman) and Kristen Stewart (Snow White) do not connect emotionally and their relationship never catches fire. Kristen Stewart does not bring a lot of passion to her role. She does a good job looking the part of a princess but it was disappointing at the end of the film when Snow White is crowned, looking regal, but has no lines to say to sum up her character. The film, at over two-hours long, moves rather slowly and there was a couple of scenes that I found could have been cut without harming the plot.<br /><br />Perhaps the real star of Snow White and the Huntsman are the special effects, costumes and cinematography.  The film production is beautiful with the design of the forest, enchanted garden and castle adding to make the story much more engaging.  The score by James Newton Howard captures the mood of the film very well. I found Snow White and the Huntsman refreshing take on a well-known fairy tale despite the film being a bit slow.
B0025UHKNS|5.0|Awesome watch.  Definitely recommend for new and experienced runners. I use it everyday for running as well as exercising using gym equipment to track heart rate and calories burned.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I could not be happier. I was surprised with the features available. I had downloaded another Bible app first that did not work at all. Thank you for this.
B001I0T92Q|5.0|It arrived this morning and was excited to try it out with my psp 1000. I threw in 2 micro sd cards, one was 8gb, the other was a 2gb. fits perfectly inside the psp, and after formating the cards through the psp itself, it works great. Nothing bad to say about it, great little adapter.
B0080CL0HM|4.0|Watched the movie a few times and, though not perfect, it got better with each viewing I felt.  Well acted by the entire cast, including Robert Pattinson as 'Bel Ami', who as young as he was when he did the movie yet held his own amongst more veteran actors.  George is not a likeable character, but Pattinson's portrayal of him makes one almost emphatize with him at some level, which is interesting.  Might try reading the book next.
B000001EXR|5.0|I've been a big KISS fan for as long as I can remember, but I really had no knowledge of this album... When I came across it - I was a bit skeptical... Thinking \\"Really, KISS goes grunge? I don't know...\\" Then I thought, \\"They did a DISCO album(Dynasty)and kicked butt at that! Surely they can handle some grunge...\\"  At the bargain price, it was worth a shot!<br /><br />Popped it in and I was immediately grabbed by Gene's dirty bass lines, Bruce's slick riffs, Eric's heavy drum work & Paul's irreplaceable rhythm guitar<br /><br />As you listen to the music, both Gene & Paul's lyrics are much deeper & introspective than you'd ever expect - No \\"Love Gun\\" or \\"Lick It Up\\"-esque tracks on here... Personally, I think \\"Childhood's End\\", \\"Master & Slave\\" and \\"I Will Be There\\" are the stand-outs, but every track grabs me in one way or another.<br /><br />I believe this is the most overall talented & cohesive lineup of KISS we will ever see - Had it not been for the reunion springing up just as this album was about to get its time to shine, I think this version of KISS would have been a sight to see with the energy Bruce & Eric were bringing to the table...<br /><br />I know there were millions to be made from the reunion-tour with Peter & Ace, but when you put Carnival of Souls up against Psycho Circus... There is NO contest!!!<br /><br />If you're a KISS fan or even just a grunge-person, take a chance on Carnival of Sins - I think you'll really dig it after a couple of listens... It's a really interesting piece for your CD shelf too!!!
B001R4MEUM|5.0|Have the original records, and saw them live for the Lamb Lies Down On Broadway. Want the CD's too! Saw them at the GVSU campus in 1974.

B001V7P2W2|5.0|This is the best climbing movie I have ever seen.  I liked it better than Touching the Void or the Eiger Sanction.
1451627289|5.0|Stephen King tells a great story, and this one is his best.  He weaves science fiction with history, and the details behind the assassination of Kennedy that have been forgotten or never published...come to light and offer further insight into the assassination.  Intwined in this is romance, revenge, and possibility. 11/22/63 has it all.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I liked Wool but I didn't enjoy it as much as other reviewers.  I came in with very high expectations because two different friends from totally different circles recommended the book.  I love, love, love sci-fi and seek out imaginative series but felt this book didn't deliver on its promise.  The Wool universe is very self-contained due to the whole thing taking place in a silo.  The author could have expanded in so many different directions but kept it focused on 2 things: getting characters to question why they were in silo and overthrow hidden silo government.  The plot was singular (no multiple stories going on) and linear.  The world in the silo knows there is an outside but they aren't allowed to talk about it and are forced to ration everything to keep the silo world ticking.  With such a rigid world, I would have loved to hear more about the denizens that went crazy and more about their philosophy and religion.  I was less concerned about the action than finding out more about this great invented universe.<br /><br />This is a good solid YA science book that I would recommend to teens but not epic like Hyperion or Foundation or Ender's Game.
B0055SWM08|5.0|first game I have ever liked. even like the music!  like the way it makes one think. also like the way it always changes
B007MJSYF0|4.0|I thought this movie was better than the Hunger Games. I ended up renting it twice! The plot lines for both movies were similar focusing on a game in which kids were trapped in an arena and forced to kill each other until one victor is left standing.  And yes, both movies involved teen romance. But BR had many differences.  The BR characters were not prepped for battle beforehand and have no mentors/kind adults.  The BR director also managed to cram in the stories of over ten characters AND personalize each story unlike the Hunger Games where the kids are killed off with only a few hints on their past history.  The BR character histories emerged slowly throughout the movie.  The director cunningly managed the development to mirror the actions of the characters.<br /><br />Stark violence and disturbing scenes may not appeal to some viewers.  The Hunger Games sanitized the violence whereas BR seems to linger on violent scenes.  Sadly, my husband did not like the movie as much as me because he wanted more special effects, had trouble telling characters apart and was not familiar with Japanese movies which have a bizarre mash-up of cuteness and violence/psychopathy.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie especially for those who are familiar with Japanese movies, can endure subtitles, and seeking films similar to the Hunger Games.

B003TJR2HS|4.0|I purchased this to connect my iPhone 4S to my 2002 BMW \\"Business CD\\" with iPod kit (from BMW)... the one with a white cable in the glove-box. Since the car was originally setup to connect and charge older iPods, the iPhone would not work as it's a different voltage.<br /><br />This adapter works flawlessly. I was able to connect it to the car and get full functionality. I can now use the iPhone's Music (iPod) and Pandora apps in my car AND charge the phone. It also works with the controls on the steering wheel (previous and next-track buttons). My turn-by-turn navigation app (Co-Pilot Live) also announces through the car speakers as expected. Pandora app can be manipulated from the phone itself, BUT you cannot change music from the iPod screen directly when connected; you will still need to use the BMW1, BMW2, etc. playlists. To use Pandora (or other audio apps), just select disc 1 on the dash and start the audio app you want to use. It will override the iPod app. I have an Incipio NGP case and the connector fits easily without removing the case.<br /><br />Keep in mind that I already had the BMW supplied iPod kit installed BEFORE purchasing and using this product.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I warrant this 2 stars, because I did finish all three books and I was entertained while doing so. However, I will admit that the writing is just terrible and absolutely unbelievable. I'm not the first to mention the redundancy, but goodness, how many times can any adult think the word \\"crap\\"? The first book was really the most disturbing as far as the domineering and codependent relationship is concerened and I had trouble finishing for that reason. The sex is meh and so is the storyline. It was fun for a fluff novel that I checked out through the library's Kindle checkouts. I wouldn't have paid for it and it's a shame that this is what so many women are excited to read these days. It truly is.
B007ZRZF8I|5.0|I am in love with this game just after playing it for at least 5 minutes. I totally recommend getting this game. It deserves to be the top rated free game. I really love the multiplayer. It is fun and enjoyable. I also like games like Istunts 2 which was also created by miniclip. This is one of my favorite games for the kindle fire
B007ZRZF8I|1.0|And shame on those who rated thus debacle of a setup highly...accepting to pay more for in game content in a pay app is a bad trend to set.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|If I could add more stars to this review, I would. I couldn't put it down no matter what. The characters were awesome and I loved them all. The relationship between Abby and Travis was amazing and i loved it. The way she treated him like crap in the beginning was hilarious. There aren't enough good things to say about this book...I really loved it and it had become one of my favorites.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|What can I say? WOW picture color all way better than original VHS or DVD very impressed. Great DVD set. A must own!
B007ZRZF8I|2.0|the game is ok. but the reason I don't like it is the in game purchases. they cost more than the game when the game wasn't free. its 99 cents to buy one item that lasts for a minute. I hate all the games that do that!
B00881VLCE|5.0|this game is amazing I love how I can buy free theme puzzles and also ones you can buy. it works good on the kindle fire
B007ZRZF8I|3.0|I recommend this to my brother and of cores he didn't listen at all so I will not fell bad for him.

B004QOB8SO|5.0|This new adaptation of Sherlock Holmes takes place in the modern day, with blogs written by Dr. Watson and texts being sent throughout every episode that are displayed on the screen- each \\"episode\\" is really a film, as each is 90 minutes long, and though they bring Sherlock into the 21st century, they do so while keeping the integrity of Sir Conan Arthur Doyle's classics.  Benedict Cumberbatch is the perfect Sherlock, and plays his role in exceptional talent.  Martin Freeman as Dr. Watson is brilliant and the two have a fantastic Holmes/Watson dynamic that is truly great to watch.  I've watched every episode at least twice, some even more than that, and they are just as great each time!  Although you don't need to have seen Season 1 to understand Season 2, it is quite helpful to gain the background knowledge and of course, th first season is just as riveting as the second!
B004EPYZUS|5.0|I will continue to do service with them. Fast service. There wasn't any delays. I highly recommend them to everyone.

B00846TTDG|5.0|I rented the streaming version from Amazon and liked it so much I'm going to buy the Blu Ray.  Really enjoyed this movie and can see why it has done so well so far.  It's nice to watch an entire movie and not hear ONE political jab, not one story aspect that made me cringe...  Thanks to the Seals, the producers and director of this effort.  Excellent job .
0142429414|4.0|This book although meant for a younger crowd was simply delightful. Twice I found myself sitting in my parked car just continuing to listen. I will definitely continue to follow this series! Theo is just an adorable young man, very refreshing.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|Last night I watched my new DVD of the recently released film JOHN CARTER. Before I get into the specifics of the film I must immediately tell all of you that JOHN CARTER is FREAKING AWSOME!!!! I loved this film and has become one of the few films that I will re-watch on a regular basis. The movie was beautiful to watch, had deep and rich character development and a story that was so good, NO GREAT, that it captivated me from the very beginning.<br /><br />Now I have read some reviews that stated that the beginning portion of the film was too long. Well, all I can say to that is NONSENSE! The beginning, as well as the entire film, was extremely well paced. Now granted I do not have ADD or ADHD so maybe my attention span or my personal desire to see all good stories have a solid beginning may prejudice me in this regard, but I do not think so. The beginning was well paced, not slow, and definitely needed to set up not only the character of John Carter, but many of the plots and sub-storylines that were revealed during the film. For example, why John Carter dies, supposedly, at the beginning, who the mysterious individual was who was following him at the very beginning (i.e. an undercover Thern, who are the mysterious and secretive protagonists of the film), what was John Carter doing with all that stuff and other artifacts in his study, what was he looking for and why? How did he get to MARS (Barsoon), etc. The beginning was needed to set all of this up for the rest of the film and it did so beautifully and perfectly in my opinion.<br /><br />Next the film goes and takes place on Barsoon (i.e. Mars) and a rich history of the red planet is developed along with an intricate fedual and caste system that is at the same time familiar and unique. We have noble Jeddaks (Leaders, Kings, Rulers) that control either large tribal societies or more advanced like civilizations. We have the beautiful and well acted Viola Lynn Collins playing the Pincess of Mars Dejah Thoris that had an incredible and sexy screen presence and very good chemistry with Taylor Kitsch. Collins was able to balance the right degrees of beauty, brains, compassion, bravery and vulnerability that truly and woderfully brought the character of Dejah Thoris to life. Because of Collins acting the character of Dejah Thoris stopped being a character and became real and I connected with her on an emotional level feeling her anger and desperation and love for John Carter throughout the film. Big time Kudos for Lynn Collins and her performace.<br /><br />Now we come to the main character John Carter wonderfully acted by Taylor Kitsch. Kitsch received alot of flak over the fact that he was playing a leading man role, but was not very well-known and that did not or could not carry the title role or the entire movie himself. That criticism is completely WRONG! I loved the fact that Taylor Kitsch was not a big name star because I did not focus on him, but on his character. I did not focus on his name, but his contribution, which was hugh, to the overall movie. Kitsch brought a depth and sensitivity to John Carter that a truly admired. Any actor can play a hero, but very few actors, great actors, can play flawed heros and pull it off. Kitsch pulled it off and he did so in spades. Not only did Taylor Kitsch carry the title role of John Carter, but he most definitely carried the entire movie. Taylor Kitsch was more than leading man material, he was movie star material and he did a great, great, GREAT job.<br /><br />Then we come to the noble and compassionate Tars Tarkas played and voiced by a well-known and great actor himself Willem Dafoe. Dafoe portrays Tar Tarkas exactly as Edward Rice Burroughs envisoned him - as a great warrior and leader among his people the Tharks possessesing a sense of compassion and empathy uncharacteristic of his race which is otherwise brutal and merciless. Tars Tarkas is the first Barsoomian John Carter encounters when he appears on Mars, and while initially attempting to kill him realizes that John Carter is something or someone special and sets out to protect him and then grows to respect him. The range and breath of emotion that Defoe brought to the character of Tars Tarkas bespeaks of his greatness as an aged and experienced actor that has well-honned his craft of acting. In a word Dafoe's performace was EXCEPTIONAL!<br /><br />The Romance between John Carter and Dejah Thoris left an indelible mark with me because of the great acting of  Taylor Kitsch and Lynn Collins and the marvelous chemistry they had on-screen. The Nobility of Tars Tarkas, the villiany Matai Shang (the undercover Thern who is the main protagonist of John Carter), who does a magnificent job himself in this movie, and just oozes arrogance and meanness that made me want to see John Carter kick his ass all up and down Mars, and the relationship, although fleeting, that I saw between John Carter and his Nephew Ned (good old Edward Rice Burroughs writing himself into his story) that was actually very touching.<br /><br />Finally, the action scene where John Carter single-handedly attacks and defeats the monsters unleashed by the Therns so as to save Dejah Thoris, while at the same time having flashbacks of his family in Virginia massacerd by Union troops and he did not arrive in time to save showed the incredible pathos and angist in John Carter and why he was so against fighting in any other wars or conflicts so that no further evil may come about. a Subtle, but powerful message and a clear defining scene for the character of John Carter.<br /><br />Overall John Carter was a Great, Epic Film that had a great story, great character development and REALLY great acting that deserves 4 out of 4 starts with a fifth star added just to make it absolutely clear how incredible and wonderful this film truly is. 5 stars!<br /><br />The Movie John Carter CLEARLY suffered from bad marketing on the part of Disney and did not deserve to have people turned off to it because of the bad marketing. A sequel to this film needs and must be made. So go out and buy this DVD, Blue-Ray, whatever, and let people and especially Disney know that just because their marketing sucked, the movie John Carter did not, but was actually the exact opposite in that it was Great, Great, GREAT from start to finish. 5 stars all the way to Mars and back for John Carter!ially attempting to kill him realizes that John Carter is something or someone special and sets out to protect him and then grows to respect him.

B0079J28NW|5.0|This Blu-ray version of YELLOW SUBMARINE is truly brilliant and vivid to the eye. It is really an endearing film especially if grew up during the period when this film was released. It is a product of that time and a most beloved one. Despite the Beatles not doing their own voices for their animated selves on the screen, it works wonderfully. YELLOW SUBMARINE is a work of art in its own right. One thing I have always loved about this film was George Martin's score. Without that score this film would not be what it is. George Martin's score and the animated images so are effectively integrated that the melding of the two created a very moving and singular narrative that has been engrained into the psyche of the viewers of that time any since that have been so enamored by this film.
B007ZRZF8I|1.0|this game is really stupid it doesn't let u load it don't get doesn't work on kindle fire bad game
B006LQQ1GE|5.0|I was introduced to Making Mirrors through a friend the other day. I was reluctant to listen to it, but I did listen to it. I like it. It a different sound, but one that I liked immediately. Hard to describe or put my finger on. All I can say is that I think the sound is very innovative and a bit introspective and I like it.
B002SSUQFG|1.0|My son was so excited to receive this for graduation, but heartbroken when it stopped working the next day.  Amazon was amazing and replaced it without hassle, so, happy son again.

B005LAIH2W|5.0|The way this film was short changed, by both the Disney marketing dept (who apparently couldn't sell ice cream cones at high noon in Tucson in August) and the critics (who seem to always equate controversial, sarcastic and/or mean spirited fare with \\"good\\" and are confused when a film doesn't fall into one or more of these categories) borders on being a crime.<br /><br /> This film has about the best adaptation of the classic Edgar Rice Burroughs Mars stories that one could hope for. Sure there are a few harmless tweaks here and there to keep up with the times (the native Americans that pursue Carter at the beginning of the tale are now seriously provoked before doing so, Dejah Thoris besides being a loyal defender of her people and displaying significant sex appeal now has a doctorate in Barsoomian physics as well, etc). But the heart of Burroughs fantasy remains. Carter and Dejah are suitably heroic, the Therns are appropriately villainous, the Tharks are portrayed wonderfully, and Woola is both steadfast and whimsical without becoming the Martian Jar Jar Binks.<br /><br />  This is a **GOOD** movie, it just probably doesn't have enough profanity, graphic violence and all around nihilism to keep jaded professional critics engaged. For most of the rest of us, it's a solid couple hours worth of escapist entertainment, and it's just sad that we'll never get to see where sequels could have taken things (the Therns in particular, being an obviously much greater threat than in the original tales, could have been explored further in the followup films we'll never see.)

B007J4T2G8|1.0|So, when my writing life took a nose dive due to life, and Tweetdeck changed its format, I kinda skipped Twitter for the most part. I'm glad it's back in my life even though I'm not always that interesting. I learn a lot on Twitter. I follow a wide array of people--authors, editors, publishers, actors, actresses, singers...you get the idea. There's a plethora of information out there in the social media world. There's also a lot of procrastination that can happen too.<br /><br />My friend excitedly told me that she read the book 50 Shades of Gray and could not put it down. This is the same friend who isn't a reader. She's read The Harry Potter Series, my two romances and I sucked her into the Twilight series. She bought this out of curiosity and said about how good it was. Knowing me the way she does, she explained that it was hot and there was the ick factor, but it wasn't vulgar. So, I went to Kindle and I purchased the first book. Then I went onto Twitter and saw some erotica author complaining because articles are calling E.L. James the Pioneer of Erotica. Okay, so she's not. She made it more acceptable to be in Mainstream perhaps, but she didn't invent it. One particular article even referenced and out of print imprint of Harlequin, so obviously, someone hadn't done their homework.<br /><br />*clears throat* I didn't do my homework either.<br /><br />So when I asked on Twitter if the book was worth drinking the proverbial Kool Aid, someone said, \\"I didn't read it because it's about the protagonists in Twilight.\\"<br /><br />Huh?<br /><br />She then sent me this link:[...]<br /><br />So here's my dilemma. I paid $9.99 for a book that was essentially fan fiction. This is someone's take on Edward Cullen and Bella Swan, how they saw these two in another light. In other words, this was someone who couldn't come up with characters of her own, this is someone who wanted Bella and Edward to have sex--erotic sex and is now getting rich off of someone's initial idea.<br /><br />As an author, hell, even as a writer, we're told there is no new idea. Okay, so I get that. There are a lot of stories that if you think about it, are basically the same thing, only with different characters and different voice. That, I get. What I don't like or agree with is that E.L. James changed just enough of this story and when I say that, if you don't want any spoilers, read no more. If you don't care, then I'll see you after the jump.<br /><br />In the first chapter, Anastasia is clumsy. She's backwards and she blushes a lot. Tons. I didn't know any human being could blush as much as this woman does. Christian Grey ( my 17 year old daughter pointed out something to me today when she overheard me talking about this to Lynne Scott that in Twilight, it's Jacob Black.) Anyhow, he talks like an `old soul' he's beautiful, too beautiful. She doesn't understand why he's interested in her. Later, instead of almost getting run down by a skidding van, she's almost run over by a cyclist. Christian's adopted brother likes her friend Kate, who is actually Rosalie. His brother is Elliot and when Ana asks him what he did one particular day, he says he took a hike with his brother. Instead of putting her on his back and flying her through the trees on their first date, he flies a helicopter. And then the whole `say it' scene with the word Vampire is essentially changed to Dominant and Submissive. Like Bella, Ana is a virgin. And like Bella, she is so smitten with this guy that even his kinkiness isn't scaring her away.<br /><br />I don't want to finish this. Because on all kinds of levels, this is just wrong. Nowhere in the inside of the book or the outside does it say anything about how much she loved and adored Stephenie Myers series so much that she just had to do this. No. Where. So, for me, this E.L. James is getting filthy freaking rich for something she toyed with and tweeked the way she wanted it. Essentially, because I read little further, this is like a young-adult porn. Badly written. The repetition in here makes me want to scream. Her blushing every other paragraph, him stroking his chin, she's bit her bottom lip so many times it should be deformed. And while I realize that twenty-one is young, the parts between her and her friend Kate are something I think my seventeen year old daughter would think, without the sex and say to her best friend. The dialogue is very juvenille because the books originally written were and E.L. James tried to stay true to the characters. Of Twilight!<br /><br />I haven't gotten into the submissive/dominant part of the book yet and to be honest, I don't know if I will, because I don't read books just for the sex. But I will give E.L. James kudos on the \\"vanilla sex\\" because it is HOT.<br /><br />I guess as an author, I just hope she never reads one of my books because I wouldn't be flattered that she used my characters, people that came out of my head and flowed onto the pages. It's just bad juju.eam. Her blushing every other paragraph, him stroking his chin, she's bit her bottom lip so many times it should be deformed.

B0079J28NW|5.0|My review of the Blu-ray Yellow Submarine can be summed up as perfection in digital restoration. No computers were used, every one of the hundreds of thousands of cells were restored by hand. Compared to my laser disk copy at 425 lines of resolution we now have true 1080p with not a single flaw, no bleeding of colors, no blurriness, no video noise, vibrant colors and upgraded sound to DTS high definition. Regarding the story simply turn off your mind and enjoy the psychedelic journey with the wonderful music primarily from Sargent Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. It is a simple story of our eternal  battle against fascism; naively the Blue Meanies are overcome with love and music; if only it were this simple. The 1.5 hour commentary is of little value so expect no insights into the story, symbols, music or artistic decisions. There is only one...the Blue Meanies were supposed to be the Red Meanies (Communists), but an administrative error resulted in Blue and they decided to go with it. According to today's or even past Disney standards the animation is crude. But that does not matter. There is an element in this animation which is priceless. And that is, it embodies a naive and nostalgic 1968 flower power philosophy that the world can be changed and that we can all live in a peaceful paradise of freedom, joy, and creativity free from oppression....because all you need is Love.

B002L4QP0M|4.0|This is the first time that I have read this author and  I will be anxiously waiting more of his work.<br />This espionage thriller is constantly moving from country to country and from character to character.  It is exciting to follow and keeps you on your toes.<br />I particularly like that you could actually hear the \\"voices\\" of the different characters.  The Russian and the Brit had different tones. Fun to read.<br />Just when you think that you have it figured out - something new pops up and you are off again on a mad rush around the continent.

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|One of a very few fantasy novels that I have enjoyed, this book along with the other two in the triology, I regard as an image of a  world toward which I fear we may be moving.  It is a marvel of weaponry and it seems to me that many people of our generation relish all forms of devices for killing.  It depicts a society of \\"haves\\" and \\"have nots,\\" which does seem to be top priority for  our ultra-competitive,* every dog for himself world, for many even \\"God-fearing\\" citizens.<br /><br />>The \\"NEW\\" request below that reviewers identify the Amazonian provider of this product is a benign affirmation of what our society is all about.  The $ does its job as nothing else can and will.<br /><br />jmilligan
B005OCFGTO|4.0|My kids wanted to watch these movies, but I didn't want to pay for them individually.  This set is exactly what we needed at a great price for the set.  There are no special features, extra scenes, etc.... so if that is what you're looking for, you may want to look elsewhere.  But if you just want all the movies at a reasonable price, this is perfect.  We would have rated it five stars if the case were a little better, the plastic that hold the movies inside keeps falling out.  But this is a minor annoyance.

B000YABS8E|5.0|I have several movies in my collection, and \\"Blast From The Past\\" is another one I consider as a good movie to own. I have seen this one several times, and still enjoy it each time I watch it. This is a good comedy that will give you several laughs.
B0056W2FBY|4.0|Linn SACD collections are great for showing off/enjoying/testing a surround sound system, or even a great high end system. My two channel system is entirely older Linn equipment, but I listened to this on an OPPO through a Marantz cheaper surround preamp. It still sounded incredible. Linn does an amazing job recording their artists. Still, wish they would choose better music and larger orchestras. One of these sampler collections should be in every audiophile collections.
1594745692|5.0|I had been waiting for this deck to be released since October 2011, and now that I finally have it in my hands, let me say that I wasn't disappointed in the least! The art used throughout the deck was clever, funny, and stunning. It suddenly brought me back to a few scenes from some well-known zombie flicks. I like that 1920s vibe the cards have, mixed with the undead. I would definitely buy a second set just to set aside for later.
B0057R5XRG|5.0|I purchased the Jurassic Park Ultimate Trilogy Blu-ray set, or at least thought I did.  I got home and started watching the first film.  I wasn't overly impressed by the transfer.  Then I started the second film, & an old add for Universal pictures was there.  At this point I took a closer look at the discs.  Inside my Blu-ray set, were just DVD's.  None of the discs had the word Blu-ray written on them.  I returned the set to the store, & grabbed another box.  Inside this box were actual Blu-rays.  Those were amazing!!!  If you Blu-ray set doesn't look good, check the discs.  Also the DVD's ask what kind of sound you want to listen to the movie in.  DTS or Dolby digital, the Blu-ray set doesn't ask.

B005723JSQ|3.0|So this is my 3rd Sophie Kinsella Novel and where I enjoyed it there was a bit of a pattern that followed in the other previous two I must say. Nice an easy read, not as funny as Undomesticated Goddess but never the less a fun story
B005ZUR724|5.0|This is the best game for any portable system out there. And definitely the best app you can buy for android and ios. GET IT!!!!! :-d
B004EPYZUS|1.0|I don't understand how anyone could have rated this trash with 5 stars.<br />The plot is foolish and Cruise is a disaster. Beyond awful! Could he ever act?<br />This is another example of Hollywood making a movie  exclusively for money without any idea of entertainment!<br />Don't waste your money
B004KBSQBA|3.0|CD is fine, but, my computer/Itunes recognizes/shows the album title in Japanese!!  It won't recognize any of the individual song titles - kind of a pain in this day and age.  But, the CD works fine; Paul is still singing in English.
0451209338|3.0|An entertaining spy procedural that went completely off the tracks at the end (beginning was good enough that the end was very disappointing). The non-procedural (personal) parts could be quite plodding. Sorry to say that I won't read the rest of this series.
B006ZCWTXS|5.0|I saw Ms Ferguson for the 1st time on \\"The View\\" and it was one of those moments when you know you just want to hear more....fist single \\"Nothing's Real but Love\\" is a gem but it is just one of many-I have been playing his cd non stop since The it arrived Monday. Love it!!!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Contrary to what other people may think that middle books are the most boring part of a trilogy, Catching Fire is more twisted and more intense than its predecessor. The pressure on Katniss to become her district's leader, the growing dislike for the Capitol and the love triangle between Katniss, Peeta and Gale make this sequel more interesting. It reveals a lot of answers to the mysteries of the first book which makes you look forward to the explosive finale. Fans of the trilogy should definitely not miss out on this book.
B0086700CM|4.0|I have been waiting for this app to come out with a kindle edition for a while. All of my friends said it was awesome. Its ok. I like everything expect some times off I am trying to jump or turn it doesn't.  It is perfect expect for that.
B007U1FEJE|2.0|While this record is written better than the Boys' last few albums, the performances (outside of Jardine and Johnston) are sub-par.  The record reeks of sadness and Wilson's mental instability and seems to me to be a total cash-grab.  For more, better Beach Boys records, check out Brian's own \\"Lucky Old Sun\\", anything released by the Beach Boys up to and including 1973's \\"In Concert\\", or anything by The Explorer's Club.
0393330435|4.0|Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak were always a peculiar pairing. Polar opposites in so many ways. This autobiography really emphasizes the differences between the Apple co-founders.<br /><br />Wozniak is undoubtedly brilliant. His early computer designs and his later work show that without a doubt. But without Jobs there to drive him forward I don't think any of his work would have reached the mass market.<br /><br />Again and again in this book, Wozniak came across as very naive. Almost unable to understand the drives of greed, arrogance or selfishness that are everywhere. In every case where he was wronged, he looks for some innocent explanation. When he says he would have been happy working at HP for his whole life, I believe him.<br /><br />And that's why while I can recognize the brilliance in both men, I like Wozniak, and I never liked Jobs.<br /><br />Although there was a co-writer, iWoz is very clearly in Wozniak's own words. Things jump around a bit as though he just thought of them and the phrasing matches closely to every interview I've heard with him.<br /><br />It's refreshing. Most of these things are so heavily polished that you don't get a feel for the real person. That's not the case here and it makes for a much better read.
B007MDB71O|2.0|I am obviously in the minority on this one. I watched Blu-Ray version of John Carter last night. I was so disappointed. My first mistake was to pull out my copy of 'A Princess of Mars' when I saw the ads for the movie. I don't know how many times I have read this book but the first time was as a teenager. So I am watching the movie with a favorite book fresh in my mind.<br /><br />I recognize the melding of two books in the series. What I fail to see is why. It is as if the director had only read the Cliff Notes versions of the two books. Also he and the production designer had never seen the Frank Frazetta drawings that set the imagery of Mars for so many generations.<br /><br />In casting, the actor who played Carter did not come close in appearance or stature. Deja Thoris, was okay but only okay.<br /><br />Costume design; I realize they couldn't use the Frazetta drawings as a start and get a PG-13 rating, they probably couldn't get a 'R', but really. What pops into my mind is a lighter version of the costumes from 'Dune'.<br /><br />CGI design; who in their minds say the Tharks as skinny. Or equates tusks with demented cow horns. The flying machines were acceptable. I can see how the designers would arrive at that from Burroughs' descriptions. They were far more visually complicated for flying machines than believable. More similar to making a clipper ship fly.<br /><br />I really looked forward to this movie. Wife and son otherwise occupied so I wouldn't be interrupted, popcorn ready, surround sound on. I guess I set myself up for disappointment.<br /><br />To end on a positive note, the Disney Blu-ray disc performed flawlessly. My recommendation to Disney; if this is to be a franchise, start over.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is so much fun. I always played it on the ipod and iphone but I wanted it for my kindle. my favorite part is the characters you can buy I have all the characters my highscore is 22,952,371

B002O5M4SA|5.0|Kudos to Sony/Columbia Pictures for this spectacular Blu-Ray copy. They really did a great job in giving justice to this timeless gem of a film, the video and audio transfer are top notch. This is also the first time I have seen the extended edition and must say it simply completes the connection between Leon ( Jean Reno ) and Mathilda ( Natalie Portman ), Gary Oldman is simply superb. The special feature section they have included are all brilliant, the honest and insightful comments given by the actors and the cast and crew involved are very much welcome. Thank You Luc Besson for this lovely film.
B00004TRD8|5.0|Bought the Skynet Edition in BluRay. This is just the best Arnold action film ever made. That's what it is, so what else is there to say?[[ASIN:B000JNN0SM Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is awesome and addicting! worked great! :-))love it and def recommend it! my brother was really excited when he found out I got it!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is spool great I love it. the more you play the more things you unlock. and ever once and a while there are EXTREME sales in the shop, but not very often.
B005LAIHXQ|2.0|This is probably the greatest disappointment of the year, if not the decade. Building up hype is a risky game. When you fall; you fall from a really high place. Ridley Scott, the legendary director; the man who gave us the Alien in the first place has done just that. He failed miserably.<br />I do not want to ruin anybody's experience so there are no spoilers here. I just want to share why I am so unhappy with it.<br />Prometheus tries to be too many things and fails at everything it tries to do.<br />Visually it is truly stunning and beautiful. But that's all. Even Avatar had a better and more coherent story. At least it had some characters that were not one-dimensional.<br />Unfortunately, it is not possible to isolate Prometheus from the Alien series and treat it as a stand-alone movie as some are advising us to do. (not that it would save it from being a mediocre film at best). There are too many references to the Alien franchise from the beginning till the end (oh, the horrible horrible end). Prometheus is meant to be a prequel whatever people may say.<br />First of all, with its glorious target of tying everything together, this movie should have been much longer. Diffeent stories and ideas fly from every direction and are simply left there lying untouched as they crash and burn. Mr. Scott, who had shown great mastery in the Alien by not giving too much information and keeping the details to the minimum necessity level has done the opposite here. And this is one of the basic reasons the film fails. There are too many things happening and you don't have the time to absorb them. You never feel immersed. You never feel you are there with the crew. You are not scared. You don't even care when they die.<br />One could have left the movie theater feeling a bit satisfied if at least a few things had made sense. But that, unfortunately, does not happen either.<br />There are movies, where I leave my brain outside so that my intelligence is not insulted. But then, Prometheus claims not to be this kind of a movie. It asks the grandest of questions: Where do we come from? Why? So, is it an intelligent movie? No.<br />Alien was almost philosophical. It was slow. It had this sinister atmosphere which started with the opening scene and the haunting music. And it ended with the same note. There is no suspense, no claustrophobia in Prometheus. No atmosphere at all.<br />With Aliens, we had more action than brains. And we chose not to see the plot holes because the action was so good. I still think Aliens is the best action movie ever. Prometheus doesn't even come close to Aliens.<br />So, where does this leave us? If another director had tackled these questions without trying to tie all the loose ends with one single knot to one of the greatest movies of all time, I could have said: Good effort but mediocre result.<br />When Ridley Scott kills off such a good idea and almost ruins Alien for me; then I say this is unacceptable.<br />Extended review 11/06/2012:<br />Please be warned, there be SPOILERS FROM THIS POINT ONWARDS.<br />Having gone through reading more of the positive reviews (and being rather disturbed by the one who called anyone with a negative review as retarded) I thought may be I should share my problems with the movie more openly. If there is anyone who can make some explanation about the below problems I would be most indebted.<br />1. Why would an intelligent humanoid extraterrestrial decide to destroy himself to create life on Earth? Is there no better way? And the Earth looks quite developed at that time. Are all Earthlings their children or is it only us?<br />2. Why would there be a map on Earth for a military base that was meant to destroy Earth? If it was not meant for us why did so many civilizations know about it?<br />3. When you go exploring a planet that may hold the key to one of the greatest questions ever asked do you only take a ragtag band of few scientists?<br />4. How does a geologist who has \\"dogs\\" that can map an entire structure, get lost in the same structure?<br />5. How does an android know the language of an advanced civilization without prior contact with that civilization?<br />6. Why would there be a 3D recording of what happened to the \\"soldiers\\" 2000 years ago? How did David know which sequence would start the recording?<br />7. Having seen there is (or was)  something deadly in the structure that killed members of  a more advanced civilization - how can scientists be so ignorant to open doors or touch anything in that structure before thoroughly testing everything?<br />8. Following the same line of thought, how could a biologist be stupid enough to try touching a new life form that has suddenly appeared out of the blue?<br />9. How can a ship's captain be so uncaring about his crew when they are stuck inside an unkown structure with a potential reading from an undetermined lifeform?<br />10. Why would a very advanced race create deadly creatures that need other creatures' wombs to reproduce, as weapons of mass destruction? Wouldn't a specific virus be a better solution? Who would be cleaning up those pests after the attack? Obviously even the Engineers have a problem with controlling these \\"weapons\\". And yet they keep thousands of cylinders ready to be deployed on their ships.<br />11. We know the xenomorph has an accelerated growth rate and we know it grew to a considerable size quickly in Alien (I always assumed it ate a lot of rats). However, the one that Shaw got out of her body had no food available to it. Yet it was enormous within a few hours. How?<br />12. For me one of the worst scenes was the ending where we see a proto-xenomorph being born. There we see a reference to the horrible AVP: Requiem. It would appear that the xenomorph evolves by taking genes from its host and by creating something else. If so, why didn't we observe the same behavior with human hosts? The proto-xenomorph is born from the body of the Engineer, having obviously evolved further from the white octpussy thingy that grew in Shaw's womb. Yet in all Alien movies humans have been used as hosts but we see no such result (except on Alien 4 where Ripley herself is a genetic mashup of human and xenomorph).<br /><br />I may have made wrong observations or may have reached wrong conclusions. After all, I watched Prometheus only once. I have watched Alien and Aliens may be 20 times each. But these points bugged me and caused me to dislike this movie (and I did want to love it). Am I the only one?
B002SSUQFG|5.0|This is a great watch and has, in the 3 days I have worn it, kept perfect time for me.  The one problem I had was getting the date and time to work properly.  Then I read and followed the directions, and (surprise, surprise)everything seems to be working fine.
B0085A9HXS|5.0|As you can see from the other reviews, there is little in the way of plot, like most video games.  Every couple of floors, there is a boss.  The fighting and bosses become more difficult as the player, ahem police officers, move up the building.<br />The difference here is the quality of action.  No video game can come close to the magnificent choreography in the fight scenes.  This is a pure adrenelin rush for the \\"twitch crowd\\".  Get jacked up on Dew, eat a bag of gummy-bears and hang on.  Not to be missed.
0062082353|5.0|Fantastic reading, as fast as anything you'll ever open. Why? Because the author and his co-authors write in short snippets, couple paragraphs, then a break. So you get sniping scenario and kill, then a humorous incident, then short dialogue on leadership and on and on. There are also notes from his wife, giving some insights into a man who puts Seals and country above his marriage and family.<br /><br />Here's a thought: Do you have kids who plan Call of Duty? Let them read this. Aside from some explicit language, there are really no graphic descriptions. I'd also suggest you could have them read Marcus Luttrell's Lone Survivor.<br /><br />MOST HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|pretty fun better than your average farming game a lot to do. all sorts of different tasks to complete good times good times
1451648537|5.0|I almost didn't read this book.  I was looking at and wondering if it would be worth my time since I really didn't care all that much for Steve Jobs or Apple.  While I own an iPod and an iPhone, I'm not a Mac guy, I don't have an Apple sticker on my car and I'm not an Apple shareholder.<br /><br />Well, I'm glad I did read it.  Steve was an absolutely fascinating human being.  He certainly won't be confused with Mother Teresa or Ghandi in terms of his philanthropy, selflessness and helping of his fellow humans. However, he should be mentioned with the likes of Ford and Einstein, as the author states.<br /><br />The book is very well written and is a quick read, even though it's fairly voluminous.  This book reduces Steve down in stature to a mere human, while at the same elevating his legacy to the top of the list of all-time great business builders, innovators and leaders.  I really wish I could have read this book while Steve was still alive - I would have certainly appreciated and mourned his passing more than I did.<br /><br />Read this book, you won't be disappointed.

B0059XTUB8|4.0|A charming tale yet it doesn't push the envelope enough to make it more than somewhat good. The tale is based on the memoirs of Colin Clark who served as a third assistant director in the making of a film (\\"The Prince and the Showgirl\\") between Monroe (Michelle Williams) and an aging Sir Laurence Olivier (Kenneth Branagh). The focus compares and contrasts the the dazzling sensuality of Marilyn Monroe with her troubling lifestyle (ominous insecurities, prescription drug usage, people using her for her talent). Also starring Judi Dench, Emma Watson, Julia Ormond and Derek Jacobi.<br /><br />This was a modest film budget put together in England. The budget for this small piece was $10M and it made a bit over $32M at the Box Office. Williams was nominated by the Academy Awards for Best Actress.<br /><br />STORY/PLOTTING: B minus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B to B plus; MARILYN FOCUSES: B minus to B; WHEN WATCHED: early June 2012; OVERALL GRADE: B minus to B.
B004J4WKTW|1.0|Maddeningly glacial \\"storytelling\\". Was there an actually plot? I was bored to death of over-descriptions. If I had to read one more description of caramel apples or tents, I was gonna hurl. And I can't believe I'm saying this, but,I couldn't stand her magic. It was so corny and over the top. There's a kernel of a good story here buried in heaps of rigamarole. I couldn't finish this pretentious dreck. Fail.
B005OSUKSA|5.0|Another outstanding release from one of the very best violinists of all time, IMHO.  I have been a fan since late 2009 & I find it amazing that he just keeps getting better & better.  I was never really interested in classical music before I heard DG.  As fate would have it, I discovered him at the same time I was wrapping up a college class in Music Appreciation.  The class, which naturally covered the entire history of music, caused me to become a great deal more open-minded about all genres of music.  Enter David Garrett.  Love his classical & crossover.  His emotional, passionate play goes right to my soul.  I believe there is nothing this man cannot do with his instrument.  It truly is like a part of his body.  Whether or not you are a classical fan, if you are at least open-minded, you will LOVE this cd.  I would bet on it!
B007MDB71O|5.0|This is an excellent movie. I had heard all of the bad press regarding the movie and when I watched it for myself, I kept asking \\"how are people saying this is a bad movie?\\"<br /><br />It is a very well done movie with a great blend of sci-fi ,cgi and great adaptive storytelling by the director from  Burroughs' books.<br /><br />I'm glad that I watched it for myself and I see that I'm not alone in those who agree that this is a great movie, seemingly sabotoged by the studio itself.
B00454U1NS|5.0|This is a great cd. The best songs on the cd are \\"just like a pill\\"\\"get this party started\\" \\"u ur hand\\" \\"sober\\".

0345803485|1.0|I read a lot of reviews before purchasing this book on my kindle; but curiosity bested me and I bought it. Prior to this, I knew I was sensitive to repetitive descriptions in other books, who knows why I thought this one would be different. By the time I was about halfway through, I wanted to strangle all of the characters if I heard another \\"oh my\\", as she \\"bit her lip\\" and he looked at her through \\"hooded eyes\\" while her \\"inner goddess\\" blah blah blah.......... I know I am not writing anything new as far as reviews go, I just want to put ANOTHER warning out there about the terrible writing of this book. I thought that it would be entertaining enough for me to overlook the repetitiveness of it, but honestly, there is not just enough back story to make it entertaining. You have to accept the characters at face value, which makes the story very unbelievable, not to mention the lack of depth in he characters themselves. I just could not get over how badly this book was written and it blows my mind that some reviewers actually said it was well written!!! Maybe in comparison to People magazine.... But well written, it is not. My only other thought on that is that maybe all the housewives that love this book as \\"mommy porn\\" were all too busy watching Keeping up with the Kardashians and Real Housewives of Whatever City to read any other books aside from Twilight recently. One reviewer asked if it was written by a teenager, and that hit it right on the head. It reads like a teenagers fantasy. Terrible. I'm sorry I wasted $10 on this one when I could have read something of more substance (or erotica with better writing!) but I am extremely glad I didn't waste $30 on the whole series.

0439023521|5.0|Is it worth it to play it safe or risk it all? How does a person have trust in others? In The Hunger Games, written by Suzanne Collins, these questions are asked constantly throughout the novel. The novel revolves around sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen from District 12. Katniss volunteers to go in place of her sister, Prim, into the annual Hunger Games, an event where a boy and girl are chosen from twelve districts to compete to fight to the death. Only one can become the victor out of twenty-four teenagers. Tributes (the boys and girls chosen to battle) must use their special talents, skills, and techniques to overpower one another in a fight for survival. Collins wanted to elaborate on how governments can have complete control over a society; the futuristic representation of North America in The Hunger Games, Panem, is an excellent example of a dystopia.<br /><br />  Collins wrote The Hunger Games to show how a government can alter and abuse their power to their benefits. The Capitol created the Hunger Games in order to punish the twelve districts in Panem after the fall of District 13. People of Panem called that day the \\"Dark Days,\\" where \\"Twelve were defeated, the thirteenth obliterated\\" (Collins 18). The Capitol wanted to demonstrate how powerful they were against the mass population. The society of Panem represents a dystopia. The government has complete control over society, but has gotten to the point where problems, such as poverty and famine, appear. The government also persuades the people that without their support, chaos would arise between districts; in actuality, the Capitol wants to contain and prevent rebellions from happening in the future. Collins is trying to send a message to the reader that problems in the book is a reflection of problems everyday; districts are constantly attacking another just like ethnicities, religions, and genders attack each other today.<br /><br /> The author's style of writing, especially in The Hunger Games affectedher at an early age. Collin's father served in the Vietnam War as a lieutenant colonel when she was growing up. Her father taught her about military life, his experiences in the war, and even skills. Having been raised in a military family, she was influenced by the techniques that should be used in battle, especially in The Hunger Games.<br /><br /> The Hunger Games is similar to the Japanese novel Battle Royale, written by Koushun Takami. Panem, a representation of future North America, goes in hand with the setting in Battle Royale in that the setting takes place in future Japan. In The Hunger Games, Two tributes are taken from the twelve existing districts, choosing teenagers ranging from twelve to eighteen years old. This is similar to Battle Royale in that a group of teenage high school students are taken to an isolated island and are forced to fight to the death until one person remains. Lastly, both are similar in that the government has complete control over its people.<br /><br /> Suzanne Collins wrote the novel in the first person view of Katniss Everdeen. The reader is able to evaluate the thoughts and actions that Katniss presents. This is beneficial to the plot because the reader will be able to see why she makes certain decisions (her actions are significant as the plot progresses). For example, in the beginning of the novel, her sister Prim gets her name pulled out of the raffle to participate in the games. Katniss instead volunteers as tribute. As the reader examines the novel, one is able to discover why she takes such risks (entering her in a fight for survival); Katniss is protective over her sister ever since her father's death.<br /><br /> The author uses repetition in the novel, which were used in various ways to either grab the reader's attention or even trying to get a point across. One piece of information that was used constantly was \\"`And may the odds be ever in your favor!'\\" (Collins 19). This statement in the book basically means \\"goodluck\\". In my opinion, it is a bit ironic; Effie Trinket, the announcer for District 12, constantly repeats this saying even though she knows that the chance of one person winning is slim. Twenty-three people will be killed in battle while one person receives all the glory. After reading this book, this quote stood out to me the most.<br /><br /> The novel of The Hunger Games fascinates readers all over the world. The book is an easy read, has an excellent plot, and entertains teens and adults. Although not recommended to a younger audience due to its dark and sometimes disturbing scenes, the author does a fine job by demonstrating an overpowered government controlling over their nation. Readers will also be able to pick up on how The Hunger Games can relate to similar novels about dystopias such as 1984. Suzanne Collins does a marvelous job by attracting readers to the novel, making it one of the most popular read books out there.
B00786XVOG|5.0|I love Yanni's music. This CD is another example of absolutely excellent work. The quality and talent of the musician's involved is beyond description. I can't wait for his tour to be in my area so I can attend!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I bought this book simply because I needed something not so serious to read, I had been reading Fall Of Giants and my brain was hurting from talk of foreign affairs.  Shades of Grey started so slow I almost stopped reading it in chapeter 2.  Once things got exciting I would say I ended up being a little more interested.  The sex in the book was lame, it was descriptive which I liked, but she used baby words to describe things, ie. \\"down there\\", and the S&M stuff was few and far between.  I just don't get it, the book was poorly written in my opinion with WAY too many repeat phrases, odd phrases at that, ie. \\"double crap\\".  I'm sure if you read some other reviews you find a lot of talk about the repeat phrases. In the end I did finish the book, although I will say that I skipped pages here and there.  I would not read it again and I will not get the other books, not now anyway.
B0083GPDBO|5.0|Usually, movies that are shot in a \\"video diary\\" blair witch/cloverfield sort of way really annoy me, but for this movie,the natural, uncut perspective was perfect. Our world is filled with all different types of storybook heroes who took upon the mantle of \\"superhero\\" and used their powers to save people, getting past their inhibitions and desires. This movie is an entertaining and entirely accurate representation of what could, and would happen, if an ordinary group of people were given extraordinary powers. Although a really short movie, it made me laugh as well as cringe. It really drags you through the heart of darkness..almost couldnt watch the end!<br />Wish it was a show, the continued story would be fantastic!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game!<br />ive been wait for the longest time just for the kindle fire to have temple run!
B006L4MWVE|5.0|I have heard about this movie when the Hunger Games came out I became interested. I won't fill this review on which movie I think is better because frankly I think both movies are great in their own ways. Back to Battle Royale, it takes place in an alternate version of Japan where they force a 9th grade class to fight to the death to keep the wild youth under control. Each person is given a backpack filled with food, water, a map, and one weapon. The weapon be anything a gun, crossbow, a scythe, and one person even had a pot lid. You are given three days to fight until one is left alive or everyone blows up from the electronic collars around their necks. You also have to make sure you don't go into certian areas or your collar will blow up too. The movie mainly follows Shuya Nanahara, Noriko Nakagawa, and Shogo Kawada, but you get to learn a good amount about some of the other students and their back stories. Considering the subject matter the movie can get pretty violent, so be warned if you don't like this sort of thing don't watch, but if you do I am sure you will enjoy it a lot especially if you enjoy the works of Quentin Tarantino who sees this as one of the greatest movies ever.
B007Q1VUMS|5.0|Brilliant music. Seamless. The vinyl packaging is gorgeous. First rate effort. Highly recommended. Certainly masters of their craft. Cant wait to see them live again this month.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|After all the reviews and talk I have heard about this book lately I was really excited to start reading it. Unfortunately, this book seriously let me down. There is no real storyline to the book besides the overly explicit sex scenes, which would not bother me in the least if this book had a storyline to keep me interested. It is written poorly and I am not sure what all the buzz is about!
B001O96JC4|4.0|I can still remember seeing pictures of Nosferatu when I was a child and being creeped out. Images of the pale, bug-eyed man with claw-like hands gave me nightmares for a long, long time. While I've gotten to the point where monsters in movies don't scare me at all, there's just something about the look of Nosferatu that's still chilling. I finally watched the movie recently, and you know what? At nearly 27 years old, I'm still a little uncomfortable watching this dude move around. Nosferatu, the movie, must've been insane to watch when it first came out in the early 20s, and I can only imagine how people reacted at its premiere. Not being much of a vampire fan, I can't say that this is the best vampire movie ever made or anything, but I -can- tell you that it kept my interest from beginning to end and that a big part of the chill-factor it has comes from watching these gritty images in motion.<br /><br />From what I've read, Nosferatu is loosely based on Bram Stoker's Dracula since they couldn't get the rights to the novel. We follow the journey of Hutter, a young man who's sent to the castle of Count Orlok to sell him some property in the city. Hutter leaves his wife, Ellen, with his friend so she'll be safe while he's away. When he finally makes it to the isolated castle, Orlok welcomes Hutter to do business, but during dinner, Hutter accidentally cuts his thumb and Orlok tries to suck the precious blood so it doesn't go to waste. Hutter goes to bed that night without any problems, but upon waking up, he notices two small punctures on his neck. Figuring that they're just mosquito bites, he makes nothing of it, and gets Orlok to buy a home in his city. The big reason for this? Noticing what a lovely neck Hutter's wife has when he sees a picture of her.<br /><br />I haven't read Dracula yet, so I can't say what was done 'right' here, but man did they do a great job with everything. It's funny how a movie that was made almost 100 years ago with no dialogue can be sointeresting. That's not to say that I think older movies are boring or anything, but Nosferatu kept my interest all the way through, while nearly every horror movie that I've seen from the past 15 years have been forgettable. Nosferatu moves along at a perfect pace, and again, part of the fun in watching it is the grainy picture quality. There's just something much scarier about these images with all the grain that works better than seeing something clearly in HD. A new soundtrack is provided for this version, since no original recording from the 20s exists. Honestly, the music sounds a little cheap, like it was all done on a keyboard, but it does the job. When Nosferatu approaches a victim, the score that accompanies the scene is VERY fitting. Oddly enough, one of my favorite things here was the shots of a book that Hutter reads, explaining what a vampire is and other things. They leave a lot to your imagination with the word choice. There's just so much great imagery here that I could go on about it even more. Nosferatu stacking coffins, slowly approaching Hutter with horrible intentions, the infamous staircase walk...everyone should watch this movie for these scenes alone!<br /><br />There were a few parts that seemed out of place to me, like one involving a werewolf. It doesn't really add anything to the movie at all and felt like they threw it in there just because they could. But since it's such an old movie, and showing a strange creature was probably quite a sight back then, it's fine. Something else that threw me off was figuring out when some scenes were supposed to take place during the night. There were a few times when I couldn't tell if Nosferatu was walking out during the day or not because a lot of these scenes look like regular daytime scenes. Again, it's limitations of that period I'm sure. But the big one that I didn't get, which is probably explained if I read Dracula, is how a certain someone didn't turn into a vampire when they were bitten.<br/><br />While I tend to not watch many movies more than once, no matter how good they are, I'll definitely give Nosferatu another go sometime soon. It may not be very rich in the story category, but it more than makes up for it with the visuals and style.
0060254920|5.0|We have read this book to my older child at various points ; but at the age of three he was really captivated by the story& illustrations<br />We now read it to him every night and he is able to tell US the story of max and the wild things verbatim.<br />Personally I think it is a simple yet beautifully worded story. A classic. What parent can't relate to their child being mischievous and acting more \\"wild\\" than child; and in the end , as all children tend to do, they ' calm ' down and are kids again. We love it!<br />Definately belongs in any child's reading library<br />It's. A perfect bedtime story: engaging, and pleasantly not too long. Perfect
B0077SGMXM|5.0|OOnce you start this game it's hard tostop. Great game for passing the time. Good value. Don't play late at night, you will still be playing come daylight
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The book was a great book.  It was easy to read and really caught my attention.  It was hard to put down and I finished it in a couple days.  I am now reading the 2nd of the series.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|I read the entire series because I kept hoping it would get better with all the positive reviews but it just kept getting worse.  I will say the last quarter of book 3 was good, but the rest was just a recap of the other two books.  Yes, we know Ana's \\"poor, poor Fifty\\" is \\"mercurial\\".  She doesn't want to make him angry, yet she also wants to make him angry.  What is she, 15?  He is not a sexy, broken soul.  He's an abuser and I'm not talking about the \\"kinkery\\".  Any man who wants to (to paraphrase) literally \\"beat the crap out of\\" the person they love because they did something they didn't like, is an abuser.  The relationship with Christian and Ana is not a loving, adult relationship with some fun kinky sex.  It's two broken people who use sex as a tool, whether that tool is to punish, hurt, or avoid any real communication that can truly further a loving relationship.  A person should never live in constant fear of their partner.  My palms were twitching to just smack some sense into both of them.<br /><br />As for the writing, I've read better books in the 99 cent bin for the Kindle.  I understand this started as fan fiction, but an editor was sorely needed.  I wanted to start a drinking game based on overused words like \\"mercurial\\", \\"my poor Fifty\\", \\"twitching palms\\", \\"petulant\\", but I'd probably get sick and pass out before I finish one chapter.  It was hard for me to find the sex scenes interesting when she was running her fingers along his clavicles and kissing his sternum.  What's next, rubbing his Achilles tendon?  Oooh, sexy.  It's like the writer wanted us to know Ana was smart because she uses big words but then makes her act like a small \\"petulant\\" child.<br /><br />This series needed to be edited down into one book and the price set like most of the other fan fiction type books.  I do not recommend this series at all.  I feel like I was swindled by the hype.
B000AJIF4E|4.0|Very good sound. very reliable, durable. sliiightly old fashioned design and if you waer for long time your ears may get wet, but overall it is great product.
1594489505|5.0|I read \\"The Kite Runner\\" in high school for class and knew that Hosseini had written this book as well -- it did not disappoint. I haven't met anyone who has read this book and did not like it. This is such a powerful book that has so many messages about life and friendship. It is DEFINITELY worth the read.
B007V5CF5K|5.0|Absolutely love it! It has just enough clues and help to keep you from getting stuck but is still challenging enough. Well worth the price and I'm looking forward to the next one!
B000003N89|5.0|Love Diana Krall and her interpretation of Nat King Cole songs.  One of my favorite albums.  Girl has some piano chops!
B006RUJST6|5.0|Great stories are few and far between...this is one of those exceptions.  Wonderful plot, thought out characters, strong emotions, and fulfilling content.  I would recommend this book to all.
B0081X40HW|3.0|Idol churning out contestants quickly and spitting out albums to try and retain hype and marketability quickly has spit out some absolute horrific stuff, and likely has a lot to do with the lack of mainstream success of more than their share of idol castaways.  That being said I am quite pleased with this album.<br /><br />To be honest, I'm a bit shocked at the reviewers here.  I think they are giving out 5 stars because this gal flat out defies everyone's expectations here, including mine, with her chops.  However, if you step back and assess this album it has some production deficiencies that I truly believe will keep this album from being a truly epic first album.<br /><br />First, this girl can straight up SING.  As many of the throwback style female singers we have seen as of late... the Adele, Winehouse, etc, you seem to get that with a bit less depth, and I'm curious if that is because of some wonky production here.<br /><br />This girl has more power than you remember, and more husk than you think.  Unfortunately the production of this powers through everything as if its a dance club remix, and I really really think they did this girl a giant disservice by overproducing the hell out of this. I think if they would have taken their time with this and thought about the delivery of this and simplified, it would have really been a great album.  Wasted Tears and Wonderland are perfect examples of what rushed and odd recording can do to a song.  This gal has a nice enough presentation to not bury her in songs that in the end kind of sound the same.  Not a perfect voice but insanely charasmatic tone and affect that at times was unfortunately hidden.<br /><br />I'd like to see this gal succeed, and if you can grab this, especially on some of the sale prices I've seen... like the $3.99 today... its a steal.
B00846TRHY|5.0|Gerard Butler has evolved into one of the BEST ACTORS in films today.  His performance was riveting and so real.  I am shocked to have not heard of this movie sooner.  It should be nominated for best actor and best film of 2011. This movie is a must see!
B007K3JCAE|4.0|Many of the other reviewers have given poor reviews for the UltraViolet copy included.  Well, since I know nothing about UltraViolet digital copies, I can't say anything about it.  What I will say is that I had blast watching this movie.  I didn't LOVE the first movie but since my husband was a huge fan, he drug me to this one.  And I was glad he did.<br /><br />You had to know that when Watson announced his intentions to marry, Holmes would not take it well.  As expected he dives deeply into the recesses of his mind to find a way to catch his nemesis, Moriarty, and distract himself from the impending wedding.  But soon Holmes finds out that Watson and his new bride are to be targets of the villain and must save them.<br /><br />The cast in this movie is amazing.  Robert Downey, Jr. excels at the role of Holmes, Jude Law does a fine job as Mr. Watson, and Jared Harris is impeccable as the evil-genius Moriarty.  The plot in this movie is fun, thrilling, and keeps you guessing.  Will there be another one??  Maybe (and hopefully) so.
B0086700CM|5.0|it was so much fun and addicting I couldn't put it down I would literally pay millions for it no joke
B00000J7S8|5.0|Great collection of songs.  The title song is from the original Doctor Doolittle movie way back when but still retains its sweetness.  Lovely mellow tunes. One of my favorite albums.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I REALLY love this game. the selection of free puzzles is pretty good, and I like being able to control the difficulty by choosing number of pieces, and whether to rotate them or not. there is a bit of a learning curve (I didn't read any instructions but had figured out the buttons in a few minutes. This is the best Free puzzle app ive played. like others though I've had some problems grabbing the last piece( I've found using my thumb helps). I also wish there was a zoom feature because the completed puzzle is slightly bigger then the puzzle area which can be a pain when you do edges first. I definitely suggest this game though. my 3 yo and I both enjoy it!
B001OGRIWW|5.0|I was running around one night at Rutgers in Jersey, partying with the guys and gals, and we happened upon the Talking Heads about halfway through their \\"77\\" set in one of the auditoriums on campus. It felt like we had landed on another planet. There were a lot of folks with longish hair sitting on the floor clearly confused by the sounds they were hearing, while the Talking Heads sweated and pumped out their intense,somewhat dissonant but hot/cool, funk/punk, rock and roll. Thirty or so art school types jumped around in front of the band like it was the second coming of what's his face. I'll never forget it and I never have. Wow! My record collection expanded remarkably after that.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is so fun &amp; also challenging &amp; boy is it addicting!!! wish it had different scenes or more action!
B00006LLNU|3.0|3.5 stars, or a B.<br /><br />Sigur Ros' eponymous album is frustrating. It's one of those albums that I want to like more than I do. That's not to say that I don't know why I have trouble with it, though.<br /><br />I think the music on this CD is brilliant. It manages to communicate what I hear as deep, deep melancholy and grief without any understandable lyrics. It really gives evidence of music being a sort of international language, tapping into our collective unconscious like an ancient signal to our brains. The first four or five tracks are pure, primal emotion.<br /><br />The whole album is over seventy minutes long, though, and the songs get longer as it plays. It's like a bizarro black hole that causes objects to slow down as they approach the event horizon. While the music is still powerful on its own, the way it progresses causes me to gradually lose interest in it. What happens typically is I either get anxious and bored with it or I simply drift off to sleep. The dense monolith approach can work, but not for something this long.<br /><br />So I think \\"Sigur Ros\\" would be greatly improved if it had more changes in pace and more significant fluctuations in mood.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|The last book you'll need to read to convince yourself on what proper nutrition is.  It written in a way for anyone to be able to understand the science behind Taubes' countless references.  If you want even more science, read Good Calories, Bad Calories by Taubes, but for me this book is more approachable and gets the same message across.  Wonderful book!  Life changing.

0345803485|5.0|From the minute I picked it up til I finished all three books, this book kept my attention, in some cases because it was like staring at a bad accident that you really shouldn't look at and for the rest it was a heart wrenching story of young love and the obstacles some people overcome to truly find it. Great book.... Looking forward to more from this author.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|i have been using this app since december on my kindle and it works great. love you can set multi alarms and you can set it so many ways.  great if you have a teen you can set it that only a math problem will turn alarm again.... great free app. may do the paid version  just to show support of how great app is
B00571F26Y|5.0|A must read for anyone you wants to be healthy.  Read Davis' \\"Wheat Belly\\", and Taubes' \\"Why We Get Fat\\" and you'll never eat the Standard American Diet again.  Our food is killing us, but not in the way our government is telling us.

B0018QQQK8|5.0|This book was worth reading.... I wanted to read before seeing the movie... It was worth it... Great love story.
1455502626|1.0|The only book this author wrote that was decent was \\"The Charm School\\" and even that had cardboard characters, but at least the plot was compelling.<br /><br />This book has the hero as a crude, sexist, and unpleasant police detective who, of course, gorgeous women fall into bed with at first look. No, wait, first they hate him, then they fall into bed with him.<br /><br />His descriptions of his male anatomy and the anatomy of any attractive female are right from the mouth of a 10 year old boy, lame in a weird \\"is this really a grown man speaking?\\" way.<br /><br />The hero's dialogue, which I assume the author thought was Spenser-like snappy, is both boorish and dull. He comes off as such a pathetic blowhard and we are somehow supposed to believe he is a hip guy from NYC. He abbreviates words to seem \\"cool\\" or \\"with it\\", like calling binoculars \\"binocs\\", I kid you not.<br /><br />On top of that, the author name drops clothing designers (again with the abbreviated names, cuz they're, like, bffs) making sure we know where he got his shirts, jackets, and shoes. Seriously?<br /><br />Nothing interesting or compelling happens for so long and the hero continues to insult people in a mean and unfunny way, so I gave up after a few chapters. (I also couldn't get past the idiotic beginning of \\"The Gold Coast\\", with its middle-aged suburban swingers 'isn't our sex life so, so kinky' beginnning chapter, which means his terrible and offensive writing is not a fluke.)<br /><br />I always thought DeMille was a sexist and over-rated writer and this book confirms it.<br /><br />It goes right in the recycling bin, I can't even donate it to the library, I don't have the heart to ruin the day of another innocent reader.
0307352145|5.0|as an 'outgoing extrovert' and a new york city special education teacher (and mother of two), i purchased this book to better connect to those around me, especially the children i teach. not only did susan cain's book open up a new world for me to better connect with my students, but also in speaking with other parents of small children as well as my own piers and friends.<br />this book speaks volumes on our relationships and how we view not only ourselves but those around us, especially those we care about. (i always thought my husband was a fellow extrovert and have often been baffled by his actions and choices. what i came to realize was that he is more an 'outgoing INTROVERT' who has been mislabeled by me and many around him - himself as well - which explains a lot.)<br />while at times i found myself plodding along, ms. cain comes up with astounding and 'revelational' ideas, at just the right moment of your read, which she can support through studies and personal experiences. i have already passed this book along to my spouse, dear friend (and fellow mother of two under 12) as well as two co-workers.<br />this book may not be the end-all-and-be-all on this topic but cain has certainly thrown open the door and told us all to 'LOOK & THINK.' as i said, i didn't want to read this book to justify or placate my own inherent personality traits, i bought it to better understand both the human and AMERICAN ideal of what it is to be a success. because let me tell you, extroversion ain't all it's made out to be.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was definitely one of the best books that I have ever read. I liked how the book wasn`t too graphic or gross,but definitely action-packed.Suzanne Collins knows exactly the kind of book a kid wants to read.A few nights I stayed up to read it and one night I actually fell asleep while reading it becauseI read it for so long.GO HUNGER GAMES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B007NZDES0|5.0|I Love Sade!!! This cd/dvd set is great. Wish I could have seen her live,but i guess this is the next best thing. Sade is great,her band is great!!! I would highly recommend buying this set
B007V5CF5K|5.0|Really like these.  Clever.  Nice artwork.  Just fun gameplay.  Not just a HOG.  Much better design and puzzles.  Played on my Kindle Fire.  No issues.  Worth a buck.  Hoping for a 3d game.
B006P3HXZG|5.0|How could you not love this?  If you have not seen this, go ahead and buy it anyway. If you have, you know why. It is fun. The animation is great and I love Puss. It is a little different story line so you are not really sure of what happens next, adding to the interest of the movie. There are lots of little references to other fairy tales throughut the movie. It is for all ages. My kids and my grandmother liked it.
B0069JBKHI|5.0|I've been waiting for this!  I had setup a generic Internet security camera, but it just wasn't the same.  This is SO simple to use and the picture quality is excellent.  Low light could be better, but for our needs it has been perfect.  It will also run in the background so you don't have to constantly have the app in the foreground to monitor your baby.  Just set your iPad / iPhone to the side and you can audibly hear any noises.  You can also set alerts if you're using your phone for other things.  I can not recommend this product enough!
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Fun and addicting. I'm a big fan of sudoku, but nonograms are definitely entertaining as well. This game has a good, user-friendly interface. The only real problem is it seems better suited for a tablet. On my droid razr, if I'm zoomed out to where I can see the board, it's very easy to click the wrong cell. If I zoom in, I can't read the hints on the side.
B007MDB71O|5.0|I was not aware of the John Carter stories until recently. They predate fictions like Lord of the Rings, Dune, Star Wars, Star Trek, Alien, Avatar, Stargate, etc. All of these stories have taken something from the John Carter series or have been inspired by it. Those who say that John Carter is \\"derivative\\" or a \\"rip-off\\" simply do not realize how ignorant that statement actually is.<br /><br />Despite my middling expectations, I was actually pleasantly surprised by the film. The polarizing reviews are reminiscent of the original reviews of \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\", \\"Alien\\", \\"Bladerunner\\", and \\"Stargate\\". These have all gone on to be classics, or cult classics at the very least.<br /><br />This film is beautifully shot, and reminds me of some of the older epics like Ben Hur and The Ten Commandments. The sense of grandeur in some of these scenes is amazing, and begs to be seen on a large screen. The music is also incredibly beautiful. Technically and aesthetically, the film is outstanding.<br /><br />There is no acting that is distracting (for good or bad). In other words, no one's performance will make you say \\"Oh, he's good!\\", or \\"Oh, this acting is terrible\\". The acting and characters are intrinsically tied in with the story, and are never unbelievable (if you can suspend your disbelief for the sake of a good science fiction).<br /><br />And that's the point. If you're a fan of science fiction and fantasy, you'll most likely love this film. If you don't, then you should probably stick to your modern dramas, romantic comedies, documentaries, or reality TV.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film. It was epic, sweeping, touching, and dramatic. I hope you enjoy it.
B005K17RU0|5.0|It is great to be able to pull up the weather.  I find it most useful.  I highly recommend this app.

B00000F1D3|5.0|In 1998, Cher completely changed her style and released an electronica/dance album. This album was the biggest success of Cher's career, and it's not hard to see why.<br /><br />Believe: A #1 hit, and it was a great one. One of the best hits of the 90s that will be remembered forever.<br />The Power: A more mellow track. Not as fun as other tracks, but a good song nonetheless.<br />Runaway: An awesome dance track that should've been a single. May be the best song on the album.<br />All or Nothing: This was a great single that should've been a way bigger hit than it was.<br />Strong Enough: Cheesy, but in a good way. Great disco beat and lyrics similar to I Will Survive. Should've been bigger.<br />Dov'e L'amore: Cool Latin-flavored song. Not as dancey as other tracks, but still a worthy track.<br />Takin Back My Heart: A good mid-tempo track. Has some R&B flavor that adds more variety.<br />Taxi Taxi: Repetitive, but tons of fun and a great beat. Could've been a good single.<br />Love is the Groove: A dance ballad, it's probably the weakest track on the album, but it's still quite good and worth listening too.<br />We All Sleep Alone: Awesome dance remix of her 1988 hit. Not much else to say.<br /><br />Overall, Believe is definetly an album you should listen to. It's success was well-deserved, and it shouldn't be out of print!
B007U1FEJE|3.0|A new Beach Boys release with original members? The product as a whole is something of a dream and certainly to applaud. Also is the songwriting, production, and the sound - perfection. But after the first listen, it hits me as being pretty somber. One, just one uptempo rocker would have been a thrill, but perhaps that's just being greedy. As a Beach Boys fan, sure...thumbs up high - but is this something I'll spin a year from now? Probably not. Check out the sound bites and judge for yourself, this is just my take. A bit too sluggish for my taste.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|[...]<br />Not sure why you'd pay for this since it's free online from the original publisher and it opened up in my Kindle.<br />These books are so poorly written.  The trite phrases overused,  the uninteresting characters with their shallow emotions.  But what the heck, it's summer and \\"it's so hot.\\"

B004D0YB4Y|5.0|As advertised, or rather hyped, this guy is the real deal. An authentic old school soul singer who puts gallons of sweat and tears into each and every song. Unless, of course, it's an instrumental, and then Menahan Street Band take control and blow the roof off the house. Wow! This album is full of passionate and soulful tunes. Nothing wimpy about Bradley or his band. The cover of \\"Heart of Gold\\" may be the most mellow thing on here, but even that one has buckets of soul slathered all over it. It's followed by a fearsome cover of Nirvana's \\"Stay Away\\", perhaps my least favorite track on here, but still worth a listen. Pain, heartache, joy, and laughter. Charles Bradley has no doubt experienced it all, and he paints a rainbow of emotions in his songs. If, like me, you grew up on 60s and 70s soul music, you NEED to listen to this guy.
B0086700CM|5.0|I have played this game before on I-Pod touches and I fell in love with it. I had then recently got my Kindle Fire and I was waiting for the day that Temple Run would become a game on it. Now that it is, I can proudly say that Imangi Studios, LLC did an amazing job. The graphics are great and the game is still as addicting as usual. I absolutely think that anyone can and will love Temple Run.

B000VSAEYI|1.0|The first order had to be returned b/c the pool had a slow leak. In the replacement order the pool is fine but all of the rings have holes in them. I am going to keep the pool despite not having the rings b/c my son and my niece love it.<br /><br />1 star deducted each time b/c of shoddy quality - 1st & 2nd time around.<br /><br />Edited 06/11<br />We unpacked our replacement pool for the first time this past weekend. The kids were able to use it for one day, and had loads of fun. The next day being a hot one again, we re-inflated the pool very early in the morning. I filled it with water and let it stand for a few hours. When we looked at it again around 11 am it had started sagging !!! I re-inflated it, thinking maybe I had not plugged the air outlet vent, but in an hour or so it had started sagging again. This is exactly what happened to the first one. Very, very shoddy quality. Lucky for me, this was purchased under Amazon Prime, hence I do not have to fight for a refund.<br /><br />2 starts deducted.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|ME GATORGUY SAYS THIS IS A COOL BUT HARD GAME.BUT THEY TIS FUN.I LOVE IT.BUT IT COULD BE FUN.YOU SHOULD DOWNLOAD IT.
0345803493|5.0|Not what I expected but once I started reading it I couldn't stop and there was plenty going on in that book to keep your interest.  Great book!!!!
141694737X|5.0|Friend and baby love this short story. Toddlers love to have it read to them. My 8year old daughter loves to read it to their baby boy.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|it is fun I like it but the only problem is I need to turn the kindle fire off to get out of the apple
B0086700CM|5.0|so I recommend that you get this game if you love running from monekys jumping and ducking over things plus collecting coins to buy things
0345803485|5.0|Unfortunately the 3rd book is the end of the story.  I found my self reading so slow at the end trying to savor the book a little longer.  I was so depressed when I finished it because now I have nothing to look forward to.  Loved the end of the story but the story did jump around a little bit in the beginning and at the end.  I would highly recommend this set of 3 to anyone, *adult age *also excludes my mother and daughter (I blush thinking about it)
B0069JBKHI|2.0|I just bought the product because is beautiful and i read its functions and what it did and that convinced me over my other options.<br /><br />But once i installed it, i realized i made a very bad decission. The monitor loses ita signal every time you want to move the camera or put a tune or talk to the baby. And it takes time to reconnect.<br /><br />I have a very fast internet access and i am sure that is not the thing why the monitor disconnects every time.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|This game is a lot of fun &amp; a little addicting. It is better if you have friends to play with. though.
B0086700CM|5.0|very very very funnnnnn :) although I wish it was a little faster on the beginning but other than that it is absolutely amazing
0345803507|5.0|The second book didn't miss a beat!!  You fell right into the second book without realizing it, the transition was so smooth.  No loose ends or gaps in the story.  Excellent Book!!
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is crazy fun. Once you start you won't be able to put this game down. Highly addictive. Extremely addictive.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|highly addicting game! I made the mistake of starting to play this game on my lunch. lets just say I was late getting back. opps
0345803485|1.0|I'm a little over halfway through with this book and it is really getting on my nerves!  I agree with the customer's review about the character not talking.  A good 95% of what she says is a \\"murmur\\", \\"whisper\\", \\"mumble\\", \\"voice low\\" and etc. and I'm imagining what the scene would \\"sound\\" like with all of this grumbling.  But what is really getting to me is that no matter how much I read this, it is like I'm reading Twilight (which I can't stand) all over again.  I mean, get some originality!  Also, the \\"erotica\\" isn't all that erotic, as I have read better, so I'm not sure what all the fuss is about.<br /><br />UPDATE:  So I forced myself to finish reading the second half of this book and was appalled by the lack of proof-reading.  The author appears to have an \\"I don't care attitude\\" with the amount of grammatical, punctuation, spelling, and random character (letters)errors throughout the second half of the book.  Again, the Twilight similarities shows that the author has no originality, but that point is rather moot as it appears that Stephenie Meyer didn't as well.  In addition, the murmurs, whispers, and mutters have gone from bad to unbearable..., it reminds me of the character Muttley on Wacky Races and/or the episode of Seinfeld when Kramer was dating a \\"low-talker\\" (season 5, episode 2 - The Puffy Shirt).  Needless to say, I will not be reading parts two and three as the trilogy was released on the same day; therefore, I'm sure that these annoyances will filter through to these books as well.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I've read the trilogy and all I can say is AWESOME!!!<br />Once you get started, it's very hard to stop reading.
0345803485|2.0|U aak my friend to order me this books and he did,,Gosh!!Anastasia is d most annoying person on Earth.I read d three books cuz I wanted to end the story but damn!!
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|I bought this item for my kindle fire, that I won in a drawing at work. I think this is a very good product, it is light weight and durable. I have not tried to use the folding stand feature because I normally use it for reading.<br /> I would say the cost is the only reason I did not rate it at 5 star. Other than that it is well worth it. It protects the kindle as advertised.
B007M458CW|5.0|Loved this so much wish Dan Auerbach could go back in time and produce a dozen classic albums like this with all the legendary greats.
0786182466|2.0|I finally had to put this away without finishing.  I found it tedious and not even remotely funny.  I got through about half of it and never found anything to hold my interest.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|great game but needs more levels update soon. I like all the new birds and levels. the boss battles are also really fun.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I love this app its fun fun fun... you get to draw and talk at the same time... awesome u should get it soooooooo good
B007R41E8O|5.0|I really enjoy this game.  The puzzles and HOG's are fun, without being too difficult. You do have to scroll up and down on the KF to get everything, but if you're not in the right area (say the object is at the top of the screen and you're at the bottom, the object name will be greyed out. Very helpful!!) I also really enjoy the storyline and the visuals of the special effects that support the story. Truly a great game for a great price!!!!
B004M3GDI4|5.0|This is a very fine light - well designed and well made.  In particular:<br /><br />  a. the extra wide stretch strap;<br />  b. the feature allowing the light to be turned 180 degrees, protecting the lens and preventing it from being switched on;<br />  c. a nice ratcheting beam height adjustment;<br />  d. a large on/off knob out in the open where it's easy to find;<br />  e. the mounting plate allowing secure mounting of the light on a helmet (plate needs to be adhered to the helmet ahead of time);<br />  f. the excellent brooad light pattern on the 'up close' setting;<br />  g. the powerful large spot pattern on the 'distance' setting; and<br />  h. the useful middle setting which is a mix of the up close setting and about 50% of the distance setting (two separate LED's are used).<br /><br />One additional note: this light, with its strap, fits neatly in the \\"Pixa Poche E78001\\" carrying pouch made by Petzl.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is three words F U N!!!!!!! its SO addictive! Get it, its free 4 crying out loud! its easy and fun :)
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a good simple game of solitaire my 7year old son learned how to play in 3 mins gotta love that!!
B005USZYDU|4.0|I enjoyed this book very much - couldn't wait to read the next Theodore Boone in the series - I've read them all- love how John Grisham describes his intersting characters - a very nice light read - most pleasant, for sure.  I'm hoping he continues this Theodore Boone series - he keeps us wanting more!
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|The 3d was excellent in IMAX 3D.  Throughout the movie, the 3d was phenomenal.  It wasn't like watching a 3D flick where you have double images at times, it was perfect throughout.  Sometimes I forgot I was actually watching a 3d film, but subconsciously knew I was, it was that good.<br /><br />As for the movie, it answered a great deal about the \\"Pilot\\" or \\"Space Jockey\\" species that we saw in the first film, maybe not everything.  Not all the questions that the Prometheus movie asked were explained in this film, but that's because Scott intends on doing a sequel, if Fox will fund it.  So in my opinion, what I went there for, I was extremely pleased.  Plus now it's like the franchise has been revitalized, just like the J.J. Abrams Star Trek reboot a couple years back. If anyone has done the research on this film like I have, there was much discussion about making this film, then another shortly after.  As an Alien fanatic, I would much rather have many questions unanswered and have a sequel, than have just one movie.  4 new hours of the Alien universe, vs 2 hours? I'll take 4 any day of the week.<br /><br />My only complaint about the movie would be the score.  If they would have make the score more like the original Alien, it would have seemed darker and more thrilling.  I'm no where near docking a point off my rating though just for some music, I much enjoyed everything else about the film and will be seeing it as much as I can while it's in theater.<br /><br />I'm not going in to the plot, because that would spoil it for those who haven't seen it.  But if you want to know more about the Space Jockey's, go see this film.  This film is also action packed.  There's very little character building, about 10 minutes in, the visuals are flying at you non-stop for the rest of the film.  Awesome!!!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|It's really fun.Don't get me wrong,but it is really addicting.And when you lose,(happens to me a lot)you get so mad.Bottom line,it's really fun.GET IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!:):):):););););):):) I&lt;3 LEP'S WORLD!!!!!!!!!!!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|First off, this isn't great literature so if you think this is a best seller because it was a wonderfully written book with a compelling plot line... well, you're going to be disappointed.  It's a best seller because there is a certain demographic that loves this kind of book - and I admit to being one of them!  I love fluffy chick lit once in awhile, the kind I don't have to think about.  I read a wide genre of books and once in awhile I enjoy something like this - I went thru these three books in about two weeks - and I work full time and have a small child at home so my reading time is somewhat limited, but I couldn't seem to put these down.  If you like chick lit and you're not offended easily by a little bit of naughtiness that sometimes borders on \\"Holy Cow!\\", then you'll enjoy this book.  If that isn't your thing, then I wouldn't advise you to bother with this book.<br /><br />The writing style gets a little repetitious after awhile, but it didn't matter to me - I wanted to see how it ended.  And the plot line is a little thin, but there was enough to keep me interested.  I do admit that after awhile I started skipping over the \\"steamy\\" parts, just because it got to be too much of the same old thing, but I still really enjoyed the books.  The third one isn't as good as the first or second books, just my opinion - but this is a review of the first book, which I enjoyed very much and I would (and have) recommended it to my friends.
B0084IG7KC|2.0|The book and movie bear a lot of situations with a book/movie out prior to this. Check out Battle Royale by Koushun Takami. [[ASIN:1421527723 Battle Royale: The Novel]]
0345803485|5.0|This is truly a book that you will not want to put down !!  And when you do put it<br />down you will be looking forward to returning to reading it ..... !!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|medium game to me could be Worse than it is could be a lot better in my oppion but the good thing is it's free so you don't need a buyer.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|The Radar in motion part of the app froze my kindle fire and I had to wait until the battery died to use my kindle again. Uninstalled it right after. I now have an annoying slightly burned in screen because of this app. Please do not download this app.
B005LAIGZU|5.0|No Hollywood actors, just the real deal.  One of the best action films of the last several years and just awesome in Blu-Ray.
B0052GWIAW|5.0|I've been a fan of Michael Franks for years. I really enjoy his laid back, smooth vocals. I am never disappointed. Always smooth, always enjoyable...
B004UCYVC2|5.0|This is just the memory card that I was looking for to use in my camera.  Great price and fast delivery!  Thank you for offering this product that is not the easiest to find in retail stores.
B005DMNS4A|5.0|I bought this CD set mostly to have a more convenient alternative to my vinyl copy, not expecting the bonus tracks to be worth much. What a pleasant surprise! Not only is the sound quality good, these tracks are substantially different from the final versions and truly added to my experience of the album. Kudos!
B007SGM084|1.0|Worst written book I have ever read. The fact that this book was taken from a Twilight Fan Fic and names were changed to make it a \\"new story\\" is absolutely what really made me mad about the purchase. Horribly written, absolutely just total garbage. I am saddened that this is the best seller and we all just flocked to buy it. It reads as if a middle aged housewife wrote it while she was recovering from her Twilight marathon. Horrible
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple Run is amazing and I'm so glad they have on the kindle fire. Thank You Amazon apps!!!!!! temple run here I come!!!!
0345803485|5.0|I loved this book.  I couldn't put it down.  Thank goodness I had the next two on my kindle, so I could go right to reading them.  I am lost in this couples affair.  Christian is so hot.  I think alot of research on sex went in to this book, although the story goes alot deeper than that depending on how shallow the reader is....  I am 45 years old and thought I knew alot about sex.  Wow, did I get some education.  Cant wait to experience the sight, sound deprivation effect, and if you have read the book, you know what I'm talking about.  My heart went out to Christian in the book because I know he has suffered terribly bad.  I read each page and couldn't wait to find out what he was going to do next.  I loved Anastasia as well.  This book to me is about healing and learning and I don't mean sexual healing although there is much sexual learning.  I found it a mixture of Twilight, Pretty Woman (though Ana is not a prostitute), and Christian reminds me of a slightly older version of Sebastian from Cruel Intentions.  I loved all of the above, so this book was really awesome to me.  Loved, loved, loved it!
B007PVHMCG|3.0|Seventy one dollars is too much to charge for this, ten makes more sense to me. Nope I do not like the pricing.
B007ZRZF8I|5.0|Like the description of this game says it is annoyingly addictive. I find myself playing for hours on end. A mualst have game.
B0086700CM|5.0|Once you start running, you won't be able to stop. What a great concept for a game! One of the few I play regularly.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|This little cover is a lifesaver. It was a gift, and a total upgrade from my previous soft, book cover type case. I love how you can fold back the cover to make a stand. I watch movies, play the radio, and even use it for email with the keyboard with it in this position, and I've never had it fall down on me. I don't think I'd consider it much of a problem if it did once in awhile, anyway. The hard shell case has saved my Kindle from ruin on more than one occasion - I take care of my things, but I'm clumsy and drop things everywhere. It's also helpful for keeping the screen clean and unscratched. Really pleased.<br /><br />As for people complaining that it makes the Kindle too heavy ... I hope you can look back on those words and laugh at how ridiculous you are, like the rest of us are doing now.
B003QCCS36|5.0|If there were an exclusive club for people who listen to an insane amount of Ray LaMontagne, I'm pretty sure I'd be one of the first 10 invited. I have every subtlety of every melody and meter of every song of every album memorized. Which I think gives me authority to say this:<br /><br />__Ray LaMontagne and slide guitar were made for each other.__<br /><br />I am thrilled that this album marks the beginning of Ray's self-production career. I am thrilled that slide guitar is given such prominence. I am thrilled with about 55% of the results.<br /><br />But it's that 45% that makes this album mildly disappointing, because the albums prior to this one have an amazing consistency of quality and complexity and interestingness, which is how a boy can end up listening to them over and over and over and over, and which is why, to the newly-acquainted R.L. listeners, I would recommend starting elsewhere, probably with Trouble.<br /><br />For those who already love R.L., this album is still very much worth getting. Some of the songs are achingly, almost painfully beautiful, more so than any songs he - and therefore pretty much anyone else - has produced. In particular, I'm thinking of \\"This Love Is Over,\\" which I'm leaning toward declaring his very best.<br /><br />The thing that Ray makes so clear is that music is not about words. It's not about meaning or messages. It's not about telling people what you're thinking. It's about expressing how you're feeling. And Ray does that (at least 55% of the time) bizarrely, like almost creepily well. I don't know if Ray feels deeper than the rest of us or if he's just better at articulating it, but there are certain songs - the ones that have the rare and fascinating combination of delicacy and soulfulness - where you feel like you are listening to sadness itself. And my goodness is it lovely.
B0086700CM|5.0|I'm an old fart and only use my tablet for business, but after the grandson snuck this game on here be darned if I'm not addicted to it. Quite fun for a 60 yr old.  He new I had an account with amazon an dog gone if he didn't get this for free.  I might just be looking at games occasionally from now on.  Kudo's to Imangi Studios.
B0086700CM|5.0|Downloaded the app, for my phone(drmax), and kindle, it works good on both devices, my son and I have good times competing. It is a lot of fun and I would recommend it to anyone.
B0036TGT3E|5.0|And yes another Disney classic,i love i remember going to the theater,when this came out in the 90's.I was only 5,or 6 but i still remember it like it was only yesterday.Great movie,great price,great blu-ray experience,what more could you ask for,i do recommend buying this.
B004XE0P5E|5.0|These songs are excellent in their own ways, but in particular I would like to call your attention to \\"Holocene,\\" which is, simply put, heartbreaking. I don't have a clue what the lyrics are saying, nor do I even think Bon Iver has figured it out, but the the falling chords and the tide-like ebb tell me everything I need to know.<br /><br />The fascinating thing about Bon Iver is that he doesn't \\"write\\" songs as much as let songs write themselves. He starts by humming sounds that feel right and only later does he try to fit words to those sounds. (\\"And at once I knew I was not magnificent / strayed above the highway aisle / jagged vacance, thick with ice[?]\\") The result is often mildly psychedelic and even that awful word \\"experimental,\\" but it doesn't collapse under abstraction and randomness like most experimental music because it's grounded in the great progenitor of great music: feeling. It even magnifies or more directly channels feeling because it skips that whole part about trying to make sense.<br /><br />Rather than putting music on paper through brute force, Bon Iver puts himself at the service of music. Rather than listening to Bon Iver, we're listening to sadness and longing themselves. To understand why this matters, you've got to close your eyes and press play.
B007ZRZF8I|5.0|this is such a fun game :) its great to play alone or with friends. i highly reccommend it! great time waster.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is awesome i love it and so do my friends its awesome download  it ;) very fun and adventures  game<br />:)
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|To be truthful,i am a batman fan,of some what.But the main reason i love this movie,is because of heath ledger's performance as the joker,it's funny every time the joker come's out,i am alway's silent.Even tho i have watched this movie three time's already,i still can't get enough of heath.I am happy i bought this movie.
B0002S947K|5.0|Here's something fun you can try at home: Listen to Zac Brown Band's cover of \\"Jolene,\\" then listen to Ray's version. The difference is unquantifiable and un-pin-downable but it's enormous. No disrespect to the Zac Brown Band (whom I respect for respecting LaMontagne) but going from one to the other is like stepping from a parking garage into a cathedral.
0060855924|3.0|Terry Pratchett will be funny at first, then repetitive and predictable later on. There is no real plot in this or any of the other Discworld books I have read. They are just whimsical books that Pratchett uses to display his plethora of puns, silly similes and over-abundant metaphors. You can turn to any page in any of his books and start reading from there, as the plot is pointless, the enjoyment comes from the characters' and narrator's dialogue.<br /><br />But the enjoyment that is obtained is mediocre. The witticisms bring me a slightly awkward, internal giddiness, but leave me wanting for an actual laugh. If you think such things as \\"sound that is so loud it can't be heard\\", or \\"not just no hay in the stable, but negative hay in the stable\\" are witty, you will, to some degree, enjoy Pratchett's books.<br /><br />Not for anyone who takes their sci-fi/fantasy seriously.
B007EC27QM|5.0|I love this app because it is easy and straightforward to use. It is really handy to have a calculator where ever I go and I like that it is as big as the Kindle screen, so I can read it without glasses.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|I just got out of the theater from seeing Prometheus in 3D. I must say I have had very high expectations of this film since I first caught wind of it. The original Alien film is by far my favorite movie of all time, it's original and brilliantly directed. The perfect blend of sci-fi and horror is exactly the type of movies love.<br /><br />The idea behind Prometheus is that Ridley Scott did not want to trespass on his original masterpiece from 1979, Alien. Prometheus is a prequel yes, however it is very original and is o so careful about not overstepping it's boundaries into the Alien film series. It is extremely well done and well written with solid acting and amazing special effects. Those who are not true fans or do not know Ridley will not understand why he was so careful with this film. Of his 30+ directed movies, this is only his third sci-fi film. The others being the original Alien 1979 and Blade Runner 1982 (also, he is currently working on a new Blade Runner project).<br /><br />Prometheus does start off a little slow, simply to build the tension for the remainder of the film. The cast was perfectly chosen and each character has a strong, solid personality. The special effects are quite natural and realistic looking, they did an amazing job. The last 45 minutes of the movie are very intense and it is almost too wild for your mind to keep up with. The sets and models are huge and very detailed and each shot is naturally filmed which glues your eyes to the screen.<br /><br />Those who are expecting a new film just like Alien may be disappointed due to the fact that this is an entirely new story built in as a early prequel to Alien. I also could see them making a sequel to Prometheus, which would be another prequel to Alien.<br /><br />For true fans, Prometheus will not disappoint. It is new, fresh and is the untold story of one of the best sci-fi films of all time. Prometheus is less horror and more of a solid sci-fi film, don't get me wrong, there are plenty of scary moments and parts which will make you jump, but it seems like it had less of a focus on the horror aspect. This is one of those movies which is very deep on many levels and you must contemplate the movie after you watch it. There is a link to religion, mostly scientology, and basic human beliefs and interactions. It was very well done, well written and brilliantly filmed. I highly recommend this film and I honestly cannot wait to see it again. By far the best movie I have seen all year.y of scary moments and parts which will make you jump, but it seems like it had less of a focus on the horror aspect.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|So fun to play .I love it . Play it all the time. This game is a game for all.
B002IVLWI8|5.0|I must have been 6 years old when I first heard this and other S&G albums on tape and have been moved by the melodic harmonies often since then. I was struck by the fullness of sound on the vinyl version. When I was a child, we had a record player you had to wind up to listen to, and the records sounded scratchy and the voices were nasal. It was old school. I have recently started reviving my vinyl collection especially with old classics and the quality of it in contrast to the dryness of CDs keeps astounding me! If you have to listen to this kind of timeless music, I would recommend no other way. This is heavenly!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|This is not a great read. It's not very well written, and by the end I was annoyed with the main character. I had planned on reading the whole series, but I was so dis-interested by the end of the book, that I'm not going to read the other two. The only thing that I liked about the book was the writer's ability to saturate the reader with that feeling of infatuation that you get when you first meet someone. The sex scenes are hot in the beginning too, but by the end there has been so many of them that you're numb to them, and want to get on with the story. I was so irritated with the main characters naivety and neediness that I was glad when the book ended.
B0083EY9EI|5.0|Thank you for creating this album..there is a shortage of \\"MUSIC\\" real music..I can relate to some degree to the majority of the album.. My kind of love and easier in bed.. are both so incredible. Its hard to find an album you can play straight thru..I have it on rotation to and from work...and on blast at home.. thank you again!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|i like how easy and fast you can earn coins.  the sidegames are cute too.  Good effects for a free app

B007P6VM4A|5.0|Where a lot of current popular music is feeding into this boring lo-fi, slow, depressive introversion, The Hives are a wrecking ball that has come to smash my walls and set me free. Where so many bands have me quietly listening, waiting for the show to end, The Hives have me dancing. It's not my favorite Hives album, but it's my favorite album I've heard lately. It's great to know by the completion of the first 1 minute and 8 second song to know I'm going to enjoy the whole album. All I want to do when I listen to this is memorize the lyrics, go to the next Hives show, sing along and jump around all night.<br /><br />The album's fun. It's a lot of fun. All The Hives have ever asked is for their fans to have fun. So don't listen to the dull writers employed at Pitchfork Magazine, and don't listen to me either. Listen to Lex Hives.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|it grows on u fast (about a day) then u cant stop playing it. good for anyone that can work other game
B004P8ITGU|4.0|I enjoyed this book and am looking forward to the next in the series. Initially I thought it was written for children but as an adult, I really enjoyed it. There were plenty of twists and turns but it was hard to put down as it held the readers interest throughout. I enjoyed its simplicity in the character and the suspence throughout.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I was really enjoying the game... then it started randomly resetting times until various things were completed to 188 hours... or longer. if that keeps up, I'm. not going to bother with the game much longer...
B005LAIGJQ|1.0|This movie is a TOTAL WASTE OF TIME.  A love story that is not believable, very faint humor, but mostly boring dribble.
B0086700CM|5.0|it sick I loved it so I bet you are going to love also I wish you have funn playing
B0086700CM|5.0|Love this game. I cant put my Kindle fire down. Great game to play while in passenger seat. A must have.
0345803485|1.0|I have read many erotic books some good, some bad, but this one was awful.  The writing is deplorable and I am quite certain anyone with half a brain could do better.  Are we really to believe that a college graduate is not only a virgin, has only been kissed a few times and then not only is pursued by a rich dominant but jumps into a sub role for her first experience? Books should at least have a basis in reality.  Ana's thoughts betray her actions at every turn and make her seem dumb and incompetent. Why would anyone want to read something like that? I like escapism, but not when the character is unbelievable.<br /><br />The sex scenes? Well, they are maybe a 3 on a scale of 10.  There are far better authors who write far better stories with far better sex out there who truly deserve the publicity that E.L. James is receiving.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor - do not waste your time or money on this book.
B001O6W9QC|5.0|Every character had their moment. It had so many funny scenes! And what an original plot! I especially loved the intro \\"previews\\". Those were classic.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Excellent way to waste time or simple games for the kids to play. gamellay works well. No bugs in the gameplay.
0345803485|1.0|This was one of the worst books I ever bought.  Couldn't even force myself to finish it.  Wish I would have read the reviews and not listen to all the hype.
B0086700CM|5.0|Great free game and very addictive to some people. Same as the itunes &quot;temple run &quot; app game. A must get.
B007Q476KU|5.0|There was always something going on,from the start to the end.The end was great when war horse came back to the orignal owner after all he(War Horse) went threw.  poplarsen
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Wonderful message!!!  I think this should be a film shown in every high school boys health class.  A refreshing change from the movies made today!
B001E45XT4|4.0|The Plantronics headset I bought is working out rather well.<br /><br />At first, the set seems to be a tight fit, which I wasn't used to, but after a week or so they loosened up nicely and are pretty comfortable to wear.<br /><br />The sound quality is better than I expected for an inexpensive headset.<br /><br />The in-line mute control for the mic is great--I hate having to go out of a game just to mute myself on TeamSpeak.<br /><br />All in all, a good choice for the everyday gamer !!
B0086700CM|5.0|This would be the first game I would get.  It's. awesome.  very fun for younger kids - would play for hours if we let them.
0345803485|4.0|I read this book on the recommendation of a friend.  It was amazing!  My husband and I have been together for over 20 years and I can't get enough of him after reading this book.  It jumpstarted our love life!  It's like we are teenagers again.  Needless to say, my husband is one happy man.
B007ZRZF8I|1.0|it seems like a 9 year could make this with help from his dad and you have to pay for what you already payed
0345803485|5.0|This is a really great book. I am currently reading book #2.  I can't put the book down!  The book is very fast reading.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This is not the type of book that I normally would read. But it is definitely hard to put down. I find myself always wanting to find out what is going to happen next. I'm about 30% of the way through it now but expect to be eagerly waiting for the second book of the trilogy.
B007N85ZXY|3.0|One of the things I admire about Neil Young is his determination that because \\"the music is all that matters\\" he goes wherever his musical instinct takes him. He has never followed a straight track nor tried to repeat a successful formula. This means that we have had works of genius - songs as varied as Ohio and The Needle And The Damage Done and albums like Rust Never Sleeps - and turkeys like Trans. This album is neither genius nor turkey, I think. Unusually for Neil Young, it's a bit ordinary.<br /><br />Young and his old partners from Crazy Horse have recorded an album of folk songs like Clementine and Tom Dooley, plus the doo-wop classic Get A Job (originally by the Silhouettes) and God Save The Queen. I have to say that I'm not really sure why they bothered. It's mostly a bit ordinary, and plain dull in places I'm afraid. They play and sing with all their old power, but it doesn't really add up to much in the end. It has the air to me of a concert in which the band are enjoying themselves rather more than the audience are and isn't really worthy of one of the great songwriters and performers of the last 40-odd years.<br /><br />It's OK - not dreadful, but I can't really see myself ever thinking \\"oh, *that's* the album I want to play now,\\" either. The good news is that Neil Young will almost certainly do something utterly different next. I'm looking forward to it.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Of course I loved the book.  It's so much more than \\"young-adult combing-of-age\\".  For me, it was deeply moving, an often gripping story, particularly at the end, and it opened a window not just into teenagers, but into life at all stages -- this while being extremely well-written and without calling attention to its well-written-ness.  What I found most striking, was showing life through a different kind of mind, what's sometimes called Asperger's Syndrome or High-Functioning Autism.  AS/HFA isn't a disease, but an important difference, important to us all.  What makes AS/HFA an important difference is its talents, particularly its special \\"perceptiveness\\", though not \\"perceptiveness\\" in the usual sense.  More as a deep meaning to what Robert Burns wrote, \\"And would some power, the Gods give us, To see ourselves as others see us!\\"<br /><br />(Know this book deals directly with many painful topics including abuse, suicide and violent bullying.  It's not for \\"more sensitive\\" readers.)<br /><br />Reading several reviews, I'm not surprised that some reviewers found the lead character, Charlie, \\"too sweet\\" and \\"improbable\\".  In this, understandably, they miss Charlie's \\"diffferent\\" mind and more, his \\"different\\" way of being.  I'm a psychotherapist, specializing for several decades in people for whom therapy has failed, often people, like Charlie, who've been hospitalized.  And a dozen years ago, I discovered that maybe a quarter of my clients were in the autism spectrum, almost always AS/HFA -- often highly intelligent and able to relate to the neurotypically-structured social world, though relating \\"differently\\" and needing much more conscious struggling with the basics.  After working several years with AS/HFA, I found these people had remarkable powers, and the usual \\"unable to relate or care\\" descritpion of autism just wasn't true in the ordinary sense.  Most were neither uninterested nor uncaring -- in fact, quite the opposite.  They desperately wanted to relate and, in some ways, they were over-caring, extremely sensitive to others.  They related differently, not only to others, but to themselves and their world and, in particular, to language.  Often not badly, but just very differently.<br /><br />Writing in first person gives the author no place to hide.  You MUST have an extremely interesting character, and you MUST know that character with ruthless clarity.  Chbosky does, and he does so well that I suspect he may have a touch of autism himself.  Or at least it runs in his family.  Disclosure:  after several years working with AS/HFA children, teens and adults, I noticed that I was unusually drawn to them; I could almost use that diagnostically.  With that awareness, I figured out that autism runs in my family.  And with that, the disease faded away and the differences began to shine through.  Let me note a few points from \\"The Perks\\" to illustrate.  Charlie's speech, thinking and relating, at first blush, seems to be almost child-like, more charcteristic of six years old than sixteen.  He has an astonishing honesty, a naive not-understanding, and his use of words frequently has that unintended poetic feel of children.  But look more carefully:  Yes, there are situations he doesn't get in ways shocking for a middle-teen.  But as he thinks about them and questions them, he often goes right to the heart-of-the-matter, and a heart-of-the-matter that's usually missed or forgotten by those of us, especially adults, who \\"just get it\\" and go on.  Let me give an extended quote from the book's end:<br /><br />\\"Later, [my friends, Sam and Patrick,] came by in Sam's pickup truck. And we went to the Big Boy just like we always did. Sam told us about her life at school, which sounded very exciting. And I told her about my life in the hospital, which didn't. And Patrick made jokes to keep everyone honest. After we left, we got in Sam's pickup truck, and just like Sam promised, we drove to the tunnel. About half a mile from the tunnel, Sam stopped the car, and I climbed in back. Patrick played the radio really loud so I could hear it, and as we were approaching the tunnel, I listened to the music and thought about all the things that people have said to me over the past year. I thought about Bill telling me I was special. And my sister saying she loved me. And my mom, too. And even my dad and brother when I was in the hospital. I thought about Patrick calling me his friend. And I thought about Sam telling me to do things. To really be there. And I just thought how great it was to have friends and a family....\\"<br /><br />\\"But mostly, I was crying because I was suddenly very aware of the fact that it was me standing up in that tunnel with the wind over my face. Not caring if I saw downtown. Not even thinking about it. Because I was standing in the tunnel. And I was really there. And that was enough to make me feel infinite.\\"<br /><br />Starting out, it seems almost primitively black-&-white, until \\"And Patrick made jokes to keep everyone honest.\\"  In the context of all that literal-ness, it's startling.  Charlie doesn't just note that \\"Patrick is telling jokes\\".  Humor is often a struggle for AS/HFA, and so they need to work at understanding it.  Through his work, Charlie  is seeing not only Patrick's style of humor, but its function.  Since AS/HFA often doesn't instinctively grasp \\"what\\" to do, they approach others and their world more basically through \\"why it's done\\" and \\"what it means\\".  Because Charlie struggles to see the function of so much, he remains very much in touch with a stripped-down sense of that function's truth.  Again, \\"And Patrick made jokes to keep everyone honest.\\"<br /><br />Then Charlie's \\"telling\\" returns to seemingly smple description.  But read again:  the description is less \\"simple\\" than \\"primary\\".  And in many ways, this is the importance for us in AS/HFA relating.  Attention to detail, of what simply \\"is\\", is consciously, clearly combined with an almost-primary wayof relating to themselves, to others, to their world, as well as a primary relating to language.  And when we see ourselves, our world, our lives through Charlie's AS/HFA \\"primary\\" lens, we not only see afresh.  We see what is \\"primary\\", what goes to the heart-of-the-matter, what is the stripped down function, and so what is truly important.  Not preachy, but very experiential -- \\"truly important\\" very much as-lived.<br /><br />And Charlie winds up poetically pointing to primary experiences, connections and always-available potentials within and around us all:  \\"And that was enough to make me feel infinite\\".  And he got there through self and love and family and friends.  Frankly, as a therapist who works most-of-all with severe trauma -- war PTSD, attachment disorders, sexual abuse, and deep grievings -- that's a short list, in those two paragraphs, of what gets lost in trauma and of what it takes to heal.<br /><br />OK, I'm probably probing more than interests most potential readers.  As you can see in other reviews, there are many levels to enjoy in this book.  If you like, though, let yourself be touched by Charlie's \\"primary\\" description-plus-function.  You may find it not only intriguging and moving, but healing.  And who of us can't use a touch of healing now-and-then?<br /><br />P.S.  I read this on Kindle and, even on my laptop, I found it an easy read.  It was particularly helpful because, now over 60 years old, I can boost up the print size, making reading more relaxing.
B007SSEBCU|2.0|Meryl Streep did an outstanding performance considering the story line and production she was handed.  This movie stinks, plain and simple.  There was so much more they could have done with this movie.  There are mountains of material and accomplishments for Margret Thatcher.  Why didn't they do a lot more like \\"Evita\\" but without the musical.  Prime Minister Thatcher was a great and accomplished lady.  This movie did her such an injustice.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|this game has hours of entertainment. achievments and upgrades carry over after you beat the game thus allowing you to max out as much as you like.

B0073PZIYI|5.0|i love the cool concept of this movie. the characters seem real and relate to eachother well with good chemistry on screen. The idea is so original and kind of hard to believe at first, but the directer and writer make it very believable. i personally recommend this to anyone who loves movies, cool style, hot actors and actresses, and is in for a great adventure.
B005LAIHQS|1.0|WORNING !!!<br /><br />BEFORE PURCHASE THIS FILM , WATCH THE MOVIE FIRST , AND ONLY THEN DECIDED IF TO PURCHSE IT OR NOT !<br /><br />\\"BORIS\\"  WHAT A JOKE !<br /><br />UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE MANY NEW RELEASES TODAY WHICH ARE VERY POOR TO MY OPINION !<br /><br />FOR THAT SAME REASON I ALREADY CANCEL SEVERAL ORDERS .<br /><br />AS I SAID - SEE THE MOVIE FIRST .<br /><br />THANKS
B007LHXQEW|5.0|This series continues to deliver. I have cried, been frightened, and laughed out load. I am hooked on Sam and Dean. I eagerly await another season of my boys. There are many new shows that are attempting to deliver supernatural thrills but this one has fans for a reason. The J's have given depth to their characters that doesn't come off hokey. It shows talent when they have us scared and believing in mud monster leviathans who are trying to rule the world. It doesn't matter what critter they are fighting they always do it with style. Always a supernatural treat:)
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Excellent read. I couldn't put it down. The author leaves you definitely wanting to read the next book and the third book as well.
B000JQUZCI|5.0|This book has a great example of what real sadness is. And, it is very well writen. I love everything about this book. The characters seem very thought out. In fact,the whole thing seemed very thought out! But what do I know? I'm only eleven. :)
0345803485|1.0|I bought the trilogy because just about every woman I know was reading them. The books are not well written, with \\"oh my\\" being used over and over again. Actually, I found the entire to book be a bit redundant. The characters are unrealistic, shallow, ect. I should have done more research before I wasted my time and money.
B007L96SI6|4.0|A well-written and produced album, terrifically enjoyable.  I hope it sells like crazy, blasting her career forward so that SHE can have some say-so about the material for her next album.  We want jazz, and we want a guest appearance with Casey Abrams!  A whole album of jazz is too much too ask (or is it?) but she tore that stuff UP on Idol and we want more!!  Great job and worth the loooong wait
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Best book ever. No more words needed. This book has kept me from doing anything else but turning tje pages of the hungar games
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is awesome. Highly recommend for those who like eye hand reaction games. 5 Stars all the way. Get it!
0345803493|5.0|Loved the book  - couldn't put it down. Just as good as first book in the series. Highly recommended. Can't wait to read the final book.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Thought this was a great ending to the trilogy. I didn't particularly care for the fact that Katniss never seeemed to grow-up and \\"realize and think for herself\\". Sure she was 17, but when you experience such tramatic happenings one tends to grow up a little bit more. Overall it was a good ending. I actually liked it more than the second book, which seemed to drag on and on to me.
B0086700CM|5.0|It is a five-star game period. I do not want to hear of anybody who rated this game 4 stars or less.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this is a great way to read through the Bible ss you can read for your self or it will read to you and you can follow along...
B00006JSS8|2.0|I must admit I'm not a huge Stevie fan, but he does have some songs that I really like that are represented on this CD. And I do respect him as a great musician.<br /><br />My biggest issue with this cd is the sound quality.<br /><br />The mastering sounds very harsh to my ears. Seems to be very compressed and a lot of treble. I find it hard to listen to actually. But others may disagree.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I resisted reading the trilogy because I couldn't believe it could be as good as everyone said it was.  Well I was wrong--I loved books one and two, wasn't as thrilled with the final book but it was still incredibly well written and just impossible to put down.  I'm looking forward to seeing the first movie, although it's hard to imagine it could rival the book.
B005HSL626|5.0|Hey you ad complainers. There is a big fat white close sign on the bottom of the ad. Need I say more??

B002LB7S10|3.0|Remake of old film, better version....I prefer to see 'victims' stand up against the bad guys instead of being wimpy, but that effort includs  parts (which I won't reveal here) that are, well....GROSS...but then I'm old and I like '6th grade' endings. Acting is decent by the leads.
B0086700CM|5.0|awsome game get it itz easy i past all the levels n open up all the charaters  n 2days whoa kool game
0345803485|2.0|Well, I admit...I got caught up in all the hoopla over this book.  It was even mentioned on my nightly national news program so I decided to read it.  I did read the entire book (which is why I won't give it a one-star rating) but I won't be reading the rest of the trilogy.  I was disappointed.  Enough said...
B000JRDUGA|5.0|The greatest of all mafia/gangster stories. This book belongs in every library. The only negative criticism I have is that Puzo isn 't very knowledgeable about firearms. This is evident a couple of times in the story.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I enjoy this a lot, addictive and challenging. It can get a bit frustrating...but usually it's because I did something silly.
B0079J28NW|5.0|and truly a labor of love, both in its original artwork and the meticulous attention to detail in the restoration process, both visually and audibly. As an original (now aged) Beatle fan, take it from me, this production never looked or sounded so good, not even in its original theatrical presentation. Nor have I ever heard the lads' songs in such detail through the use of such innovative surround processing. Don't let this slip through your fingers. Buy it, and be awe-inspired by the groundbreaking animation techniques applied in the brilliant Lucy In The Sky and Eleanor Rigby sequences that are so indicative of the decade and style of the Beatles, the sharp wit and humor, and some pretty good lessons along the way. Cheers!
B0063IH60K|4.0|Fun and User friendly.what more would you want. Free is good too. Style options make it always fresh.<br />that's it.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Spindle fit my lawnmower prefect, was an easy install.  What I did when I installed it was I bolted the lawnmower blade to the spindle, picked up on the deck and slid it under the deck then pulled it through the hole.  Then I started 1 Bolt towards the inside of the deck that way it puts the spindle on an angle so you can put the pulley on, then the nut,  now if you have an Air compressor tighten the nut, the blade won't spin because it's laying on the floor and shouldn't be able to spin.  Now all you have to do is install the other 2 Bolts, tighten them up and put you belt back on and your ready to go cut your lawn.  Amazon is the cheapest place online I found for this Lawn mower Spindle.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game because of its cool things in it such as the crazy monkey beasts with skull heads.
B007EC27QM|5.0|find this application very useful and simple .  works  great  with kindle fire. worth the price for only. 99 cents. must have for all kindle fire.
B0000T70K4|5.0|So everyone seems to despise this book. While I can see why many people find issues liking this novel, I found it really compelling. There's a darkness in the novel that becomes more persistent with every page.<br /><br />The entire novel consists of the main character, Eric, getting driven to a barbershop across town. It also consists of him pursuing a bet against the yen, among other things. I will not spoil the book for you, but what happens in between his sprawling penthouse and the barbershop is pretty insane and comical in a disturbing sort of way. Eric's pondering thoughts and questions are very existentialist, which are further explored by the other characters that join him in his stretch limousine.<br /><br />Even though the novel takes place in 2000 and was actually written in 2003, it is eerily reminiscent of the protests going on today in the United States. While many other countries are unafraid to stage protests against the elite and the powerful, the United States has usually been hesitant. In many ways this novel is very political and controversial. Should we really blame billionaires like Eric Packer?  It's so easy to hate figures like him, men with so much money and little worries in life. Ironically, the novel shows that deep down inside, Eric is as barren as a shell. He finds himself asking trivial questions, not just to himself but to other people. But are they really trivial questions, or just ones we never ask ourselves?<br /><br />Something else I really admire about this book is the way Eric changes throughout the story. He goes through a metamorphosis of sorts, which is confirmed by the end of the novel. I didn't expect him to change his outlook.<br /><br />I feel like I could write a whole lot more because this novel made really pause and think about a lot of issues and ideas. It was also extremely funny in some parts and made me chuckle. DeLillo's prose is beautiful throughout this book and he writes with a cunning eye that is observant of the tiny details that make up everyday life.f the tiny details that make up everyday life.
B00846REIS|4.0|I bought this book for my kindle because other reviewers had compared it to 50 shades and I was looking for something similar and steamy. While I don't think it was as good as 50 shades (but what is?!) I still liked it and read it very quickly. Good beach read, will definitely read the next installment whenever it comes out.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I thought this book was very good.  I had a great \\"leave you hanging\\" at the end.  I immediately bought and read the third book.
B006LSZECO|5.0|The characters are real with realistic suspense. It makes you keep turning the pages. Best book ever!! Get it. It is well worth the read.
B00881VLCE|2.0|App is amazing compared to the first one I tried, like the variety of themed packs. Would have given more stars; due to issues with lagging, minor glitching, and constant demand to have a review posted I cannot go higher than 3. Even with the frustration I still like this app a lot.<br /><br />Edit: Since writing this review I tried to download a puzzle pack and it would not work, also operating problems continued so I ended up deleting the app. My kindle has been running better since deleting this app, dislike writing a review like this especially seeing others loving this app and not having problems with it. It's too bad that it was problematic on my kindle because I really liked the puzzles and it kept me busy until I finished the few that I tried.
B00005ASHM|5.0|\\"God only knows\\" is my favorite.  The writing of the songs and singing is phenomenal and this group has got to be the best from the last 50 years.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I liked the book although a little more explnation at the end would have helped more.  Overall a good ending to the trilogy.
145470246X|5.0|This book is awesome , and the projects come out beautiful!<br />Also, this one is in English!<br />I have not yet had the time to work on this book myself, however, I have been doing some reading, and planning. I have a friend in NC, that owns a Bead Store, and also teaches classes. She is the one that told me about this book. She has made several of the projects, and they are beautiful.She always adds her own touches.<br />I just can't wait to have to time to start maling my own 'Fantasies'

1469984202|5.0|I really enjoyed this book (Wool Omnibus - Kindle) and was sneaking away to read it as much possible! The slow reveal of \\"facts\\", the characters of Jules and Lukas (even Bernard!) as well as a satisfying ending made for a VERY enjoyable read.
B001FBSMF8|4.0|When listening to Scream, there are 2 keys.<br />1-Have an open mind and dont compare it to other Chris Cornell/Soundgaden/Audioslave/Temple of the Dog albums<br />2- Listen to it opening track to closing-its a better experience<br /><br />When I first heard of the collaboration as a die hard Cornell fan-I instantly thought WTF????  Then I figured even if this album is terrible new young R&B fans may learn about Chris Cornell's previous work- got it free when bought tickets to his Chicago tour date in 2009-the album is an excellent DANCE ALBUM<br /><br />As an album from Cornell I rate it a 3/5, as a dance album a 5/5- decided to split the difference<br /><br />For traditional Cornell fans, the hidden Two Drink Minimum is the albums best (my personal favorite)-a bluesy, down and out song reminiscent of Euphoria Morning's When I'm Down-this is clearly the album's hidden gem<br /><br />The title track Scream, along with Long Gone (ballad), Never Far Away, Climbing Up The Walls and fun to listen to Take Me Alive and Ground Zero are the other key tracks that I enjoyed.<br /><br />Lyrically this is a weak Cornell album, with tracks such as Part of Me and Climbing Up the Walls as examples of sub-par songwriting<br /><br />However, as a DANCE ALBUM, I deem the lyrics as a strong suit relative to albums in that genre.<br /><br />Tracks on there own don't make as much sense, as they loop into each other.  Some tracks grew on me by listening to the album as a loop.  Cornell's lyrics are more subdued, and really shouldn't be drowned out.  However Chris' voice is still a revelation, and works well with these loud catchy beats.  This is not a perfect album, however the album on its own is a great listen and an excellent dance album.

B005LAIH3G|3.0|I think some of the reviewers might be over correcting for the bad reviews that this film got and it's box office flop status. The truth is that this is a reasonably entertaining film with some flaws that kept it from being a great film. The acting was mediocre with the exceptions of Bryan Cranston and Mark Strong in their small, underutilized roles. The visual effects and production design were beautiful, perhaps too beautiful for a dusty, windy desert planet. I expected things to be dirtier, grittier than they were. The action scenes were strong, however the editing of the film was choppy at times, hurrying the plot along where perhaps they should have lingered, building a stronger connection with characters and places. Plot was predictable with the plot and character revelations too convenient. It was also inconsistent with it's portrayal of JC, who has superman like powers in some segments, yet he is entirely overwhelmed by a single alien in another. They also left some dangling plot lines, clearly anticipating a sequel during the making of the film, instead of rewarding the audience by wrapping up the loose ends. But honestly, most of these things are forgivable in a summer action blockbuster.<br /><br />I think one of the biggest flaws of this film is that Mars is too simply to close to home, too well known for us, the audience, to suspend our disbelief. We have sent probes and robot rovers to the red planet, and we know that it is highly unlikely that sophisticated life developed on Mars. We know that a transplanted human wouldn't be able to jump hundreds of feet through the air or have enough strength to whip 300lb boulders around their head like a towel. Heck, we know a human being can't even survive on Mars without a pressure suit. Die hard SciFi fans are able to overlook these things and simply enjoy the film for what it is, whereas the general public probably isn't. I think it simply didn't connect with the general audience. I would have probably changedthe setting to a more unfamiliar place, but purists would probably hate that.<br /><br />Oh well - Avatar it isn't, nor The Empire Strikes Back. More like Phantom Menace or Clone Wars. Definitely worth a rent to see what the fuss is about, but unless you are a die hard scifi fan, it probably isn't worth a buy.

B0086700CM|5.0|Temple run is very fun and addicting.  I am very happy that it came to amazon.  I was wondering of they had it.  They didn't at the time.  The I looked at the apps one day and it was the free paid for game for the day and I immediately got it.
B00008GKEG|4.0|This is a vast exposure of the Beatles and at times, too much...great selection of their careers, but many want to hear the radio hits and tunes from shows and movies and the filler oversensifies.
B0063IH60K|5.0|works great on kindle fire ...I have had this game downloaded for a while and I have had no problems...nothing fancy just a good card game

0142420891|5.0|Did this as an audio and loved it!<br /><br />What a perfect follow-up to If I Stay, except this time the reader learns the story from Adam's point of view.<br /><br />Mia has survived a horrific car crash that killed her entire family, and as sole survivor she now must live her life on her terms. Except there is one problem: Adam. He wants to be a part of her life as well, and readers will learn what became of their relationship.<br /><br />Mia and Adam will stroll down memory lane together, and readers will learn what life has been like for the two of them.<br /><br />I had no unanswered questions at the conclusion of this novel, I just wanted more.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The 1st book was great.  This one was AWESOME!! What a twisted plot, but such an entertaining story. Hope they make this book into a movie too!!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|no problems game is awsome will recomend it to whoever has never played this game  and there is no glitches and i give it  a 5***** star
014241543X|5.0|A fantastic audio, but do not start this novel while driving down a dark road late at night all by yourself. TRUST me!<br /><br />The plot of this novel is absolutely heartbreaking, especially because I teach teenagers, but Forman takes great care with it.<br /><br />While riding with her family on an icy day, a car crash kills her entire family. Mia is the only survivor. Readers are thrust into her world as she is rushed to the hospital and the doctors fight to save her life. We experience her franticness as she awaits to learn the fate of her younger brother, Teddy. And while she is having an \\"out of body\\" experience, readers ache with her as she discovers the truth about herself - and what she really wants.<br /><br />The ending of the novel was a cliffhanger, and I wanted more immediately. Luckily for me, I waited to read this novel until the sequel was out, so I just simply popped in the next CD. But for those who read the novel when it was first published, I can see where the ending would frustrate a bit. I literally wanted just one more sentence.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I could not put this book down!!  It had plot, sex, and drama.  I read all 3 in the trilogy and hoping there will be more!!!

B006UG909U|5.0|I'll make it short: A Different Kind of Truth is an astonishing feat.  Try to name five hard rock bands that produced even a decent record with the band members closing in on 60.  That's right, you can't.  This album is far better than decent, it's great.  Not a filler to be found, and heavy as hell.  Women & Children heavy.  Fair Warning heavy.  Honeybabysweetiedoll is brutal.  It's evil.  And I mean that in the best possible way.  You and Your Blues/Blood and Fire: hooks galore.  As Is: one of the best songs Dave & Eddie ever wrote.  Stay Frosty is Ice Cream Man 2012, but better.  Best record of the year.  I feel sorry for Aerosmith, another one of my favorite bands of all time, because they're releasing an album in the fall and they'll have to top this.  Good luck...

1439102813|2.0|Sometimes a non fiction book about an illness such as The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lachs is so well done that it reads like a novel. And sometimes novels about an illness reads like a medical treatise.  Unfortunately in the case of this book, the latter has happened.<br /><br />I knew the subject matter of the book, and was curious as to how this author would handle it.  It is well written, and actually well researched.  Problem is, you can see the research over every page, making it really unreadable.  The author doesn't want to tell me a story, she wants to teach me; many times I felt like I as reading a dr's brouchere. Her cause is a nobel one, and the fact that she has brought this horrible disease front and center is a positive result of this book.  But she should have written a non fiction account of an affected family to suit her purpose.  If she wanted to write a novel about this, she needed to tell a story.<br /><br />In comparison, Ive read many novels dealing with people who are diagnosed with serious illnesses that work as stories. Usually the author gives us a sense of who these people are, a connection with them that makes you want to find out about their journey, and keeps you hooked on the story all the way to the end. A good example is The Good Husband by Gail Godwin. Interesting, it is also about a college professor, but who has cancer. By the time she was diagnosed you already knew her history, and her relationship with her husband. I saw both of them as very complex characters, and after I read it, had a sense of loss for this dynamic young woman, while at the same time was very glad to have 'known' here..Yes there is information in Godwin's book, but it never becomes the story.<br /><br />I know this book is highly rated; I think in part this is because so many of us have been affected by this disease that any  book which sheds light on the subject is welcomed with open arms. I hope those of you who were able to garner some comfort, knowledge and or strength do not feel insulted by my comments. Im glad the book worked for you. It did not for me. Hopefully this authors next book will give me what I look for in a novel - a story.and or strength do not feel insulted by my comments. Im glad the book worked for you. It did not for me.

B007SGM084|5.0|Fifty Shades of Grey along with the two books that follow are a summer must read!!!  I downloaded the trilogy.  No matter where I went, I was able to read from my phone or my iPad.  Within two weeks, all three books were read.  The first book is VERY sexy.  The second gives the reader a understanding as to why Christian Grey has his quirks, and the third is suspenseful.  I'm actually relieved I am finished with the books, so I could resume my \\"normal\\" life.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a really Good app. there is many games to buy play and master. lots of fun. my favorite has to be either the darts or thee hockeyyyyyyy
B007ZRZF8I|2.0|this game is fun on miniclip until you smash your computer against a wall to find what the problem is. I saw it on my Kindle Fire for free and thought gee thanks! you got a game I liked on my laptop. I turned it on and it froze. I went running into my dads room saying how it froze. I hit the power button a few times and it just wasn't turning to the home screen. AGH! THAT SCARED ME TO HECK!! it was fine. I DONT RECOMMEND GETTING THIS APP FOR KF
0345803485|5.0|Literally could not put this book down. I'm on the last of the trilogy and have only had the last 2 books for a little over a week. 50 more pages to go....can't wait to see what happens.
B007U1FEJE|3.0|Wow, who would have thought of it. After 20 odd years of constantly suing each other over royalties, band-name ownership & biography accusations; The Beach Boys have buried the hatchet (although the release of Smile in 2011 probably had something to do with it)<br />Anyhow, If you are new to the Beach Boys & don't own any of their records, do not buy this one. Instead purchase \\"The Beach Boys Today\\", \\"Pet Sounds\\", \\"20/20\\", \\"Surf Up\\", \\"Holland\\" or anything the band realised in 60's & 70s.<br />But saying all that, this isn't a bad record, for a start it doesn't sound like a Brian Wilson Solo album (be thankful for small mercies!),with most of the songs having a slower pace to them, concentrating more on the harmonies, rather than the music (which I don't feel the band have even been given the credit for, especially Car Wilson an excellent guitarist).<br />It does make a decent bookend to their career,(Brian Wilson has hinted that he want to make a follow up record, but with a more up tempo rock n' roll feel) although the band have gone for quite a retro sound, so should have used the old 4 & 8 track studio equipment that the recorded on in the Sixties.<br />Oh & seeing that their touring the album, it will be interest to hear the inevitable live record & how much of a greatest package they put together.
0785162348|5.0|Such a great read and look see. I recommend it to anyone! Beautiful art just bounces off the pages! I'm a comic book fan and love it. But guaranty you don't have to be to appreciate the incredible art!
B00723NWJE|2.0|Little Broken Hearts was surprisingly disappointing for me. Her voice was too airy and there was way too much going on with the back up vocals. I dont these songs represent her well nor showcase her talent. While I think it is great when artists continue to create new work, this just isnt a good set of recordings for her.
B007U1FEJE|5.0|Brian Wilson has really done his thing on this album. This is Why God Made the Radio is classic Beach Boys. It feels like their old stuff from the '60s. I absolutely love it and have already listened to it several times since I got it yesterday!

B005LAIHY0|4.0|Well even though it started nearly an hour behind schedule, I finally got to see Ridley Scott's long awaited \\"Prometheus\\" this evening. It has been debated whether or not this movie is a full-fledged \\"Alien\\" prequel. I can happily put those rumors to rest. \\"Prometheus\\" certainly takes place prior to \\"Alien\\" and it establishes tie-ins to the franchise at regular intervals; but this is not another \\"Alien\\" movie. I know that this sounds a little confusing, and it is; but once you see the film for yourself, you'll understand exactly what I mean. I'm not trying to say that \\"Prometheus\\" is formulaic, it may set up the events of the \\"Alien\\" franchise; but it is its own beast all together.<br /><br />Helmed by Ridley Scott, who also directed 1979's \\"Alien\\". Ridley returns to the genre of Science Fiction after nearly a thirty year hiatus. Despite the gap, Ridley Scott certainly feels right at home in this field of story telling. Anyone who's ever seen a Ridley Scott film knows that he's always been a stickler for detail. The best part about Sci-fi is that he gets to make up all the details himself now. Honestly, does anybody know why Ridley wasn't asked to direct any of the other \\"Alien\\" films? I'm pretty sure he could have saved it a lot sooner. \\"Prometheus\\" boasts phenomenal visual effects and gruesome Alien mayhem; but never once did I feel as though I was watching something fictional. Everything on screen looks and feels as though it would really work and in doing so captivated me as an audience member.<br />Starring a AAA cast: Noomi Rapace, Charlize Theron, Guy Pearce, Idris Elba, and one of my personal favorites Michael Fassbender all do exceptional work here. I won't go into too much detail about their respective characters, because I don't want to spoil anything. Elizabeth Shaw (Rapace) is part of team of explorers. They discover clues scattered across the globe pointing to the origins of mankind's presence on Earth. These findings lead the team on a journey across the stars to the darkest corners of the universe. Aboard their spaceship \\"Prometheus\\", they touch down on a foreign planet with hopes to make contact with alien life forms. Well make contact they do, and they must fight a thrilling and at times, terrifying battle to save the future of the human race.<br /><br />\\"Prometheus\\" may not answer all the big questions that its starts out trying to accomplish; but it does provide us with a satisfying story and compelling characters. It may not be everything we were hoping for, but I would label this as well done cinema. In the end, \\"Prometheus\\" may be construed as being a victim of over hype, but I believe that it delivers on most of its promises. It will be enjoyed by fans of the \\"Alien\\" franchise and hopefully regarded as the new standard for any more films in that franchise to come.the stars to the darkest corners of the universe.

B000O8OTNC|5.0|This sharpener will keep your knives razor sharp if you make sure that you don't let your knife get too dull.  The rat tail is useful, but using it to reshape a neglected blade would be time consuming because of its size. I've owned a variety of sharpeners and this one has been the best by far.  For the few dollars you get a sharpener that will last you a couple years.  You'll probably lose it before you wear it out.

B0029LHW4U|5.0|I like this album alot...It has all the elements of classic AIC. The new singer does a terrific job, I miss Layne, but still William  a very good singer and the harmonies with Jerry are perfect ( check out \\"A Looking In View\\" ).<br />I hope we dont have to wait another 15 years for another album!<br />Some of my favorites on the album are:<br />Check My Brain<br />Last of My Kind<br />A Looking View<br />Private Hell<br />Black Gives Way To Blue

B0040HO16S|5.0|I have now watched the entire first season of Larks Rise and I am so very hooked.<br />Now, I will be watching Season two and suspect I will be watching any season that comes after that.<br />This is a story of two different classes of people. The poor of Larks Rise and the well-to-do of Candleford. Sometimes, the classes have ties to each other and then you can see how things were handled in the late 1800s. You see woman who have gained stature, spinsters and a young girl coming of age.<br />All in all, you will laugh, cry and commiserate with these characters and every time the episode ends, you will be clicking on the Next episode button.<br /><br />I watched this on the Prime Instant Video.
B00729Z6R4|5.0|When I first read that Swedidh rockers H.E.A.T were releasing another album post-Kenny Leckremo, I wasn't too sure what to expect. Then I read they were replacing him with Eric Gronwall, a Swedish Idol winner, I was really sent off the rails. Fortunately for all of us H.E.A.T fans, this album is nothing short of astonishing, and Gronwall's vocals are pretty terrific throughout(he's not Kenny Leckremo, but who the heck is).<br /><br />If you have ever heard H.E.A.T at any point in their existance, then you know what to expect from this record. This is melodic rock like they used to do it back in the day, think Survivor(who, for some reason, these guys really remind me of), Journey and Asia, then you'll have an idea of what these guys bring to the table. The overall sound of the album seems bigger than previous offerings from the band. it also seems like they went just a dogs hair heavier on this record as well, which suits me just fine. These songs were my favorites, \\"Livin' On The Run,\\" \\"Breaking The Silence,\\" \\"In And Out Of Trouble\\" and \\"It's All About Tonight.\\"<br /><br />I can't recommend this album enough to fans of H.E.A.T, or anything else coming out of Sweden these days. Trust me, you will not be disappointed by \\"Address The Nation.\\" It's as amazing as everything else these guys have ever put out!

B000001Y2U|5.0|It honestly sickens me that people are so close minded. I am a christian and I DO like Marilyn Manson. This has to be my favorite record by him, out of all 8 records he has put out. It is loud and helluva dark. I really enjoy how some songs are mellow and slow,with a soft bass. Then there are some that are loud and raging. This records is by far, one of the best i think that has been put out in the last twenty years. The media stir that this album caused is ridiculous, this is mainly because America is stuck on their own aging ideals and are to terrified to consider any other means of thinking. This record has made me think out of my own box and think about other religions and others means of thinking. It hasn't brainwashed me or turned me violent. It hasn't made me atheist or satanic. People are missing out if they are too shallow to even consider Marilyn Manson.<br /><br />We start out with \\"Irresponsible Hate Anthem\\" the raging rant against people's hate and criticisms. It has a hard guitar and raging drums. Manson sings loud and proud. Then we flow into \\"The Beautiful People\\" the song that became a MTV staple and one of his most successful singles. It's hard and talks about America in a way of fascism and totalitarianism. It's really a good one, but it wears then after a couple of dozen listens. We then get to go on the journey called \\"Dried Up, Tied and Dead To The World\\" just the title makes me shudder. This isn't one of my favorites but its still a good line. It explores hate, self loathing, and drug abuse. Lines like \\"I'll be your lover, i'll be forever. I'll be tomorrow, I am anything when i'm high\\", explore the depression and hollowness of the character talked about in the song. Next is Tourniquet a slowed down mid tempo song that tells the story of a lover that uses Manson and throws him to the dirt, he gives everything to this person, then they don't care. That is what I take from the song, not sure about the meaning. Its kind of demented sounding and haunting.<br /><br />We follow Manson into a different hell, one that is demented and evil. This starts with Little Horn, it sounds angry and determined. I really like this song, its loud and a departure from the previous song. Then there is the short song Cryptorchild. This song is gross but good at the same time, it represents a metamorphosis from shy and reserved (and angry inside) to a loud violent protester that will wreak havoc. The song is creepy and haunting. Deformography delves deeper into this transformation and talks about this monster that has become from the metamorphosis. Great loud song. Wormboy sounds kind of in your face, look at me know. Song about a boy that was made fun of and ostracized by people earlier in his life. He has shown that he is not a little creature and has evolved into something scary and taunting. Mister Superstar looks at the violent creature dragging people down with him, it explores deadly obsession and attachment to something that is out of reach. Dying and longing for someone that they envy and want everything from. Creepy and a good song. One of my favorites on the album \\"Angel With The Scabbed Wings\\" this song is amazing, hard and rough. The vocals are creepy and terrifying. He is right on, perfect addition. Adds to the album and story.<br /><br />Kinderfeld slows it down a notch, but there is no loss of creepiness or haunting. The song is about Manson's grandfather's sick sexual fetishes. It is dark and blunt. This is when everything dies, there is nothing left to live for. The world is being taken over by the Antichrist, he is almost like a ruler, preaching and talking about new life and destroying anything that stands in the way. Then there is 1996, a song about discrimination and close minded Christians. This song presents the creature at his fullest still crazy over his new position as ruler. As all fails in the storyline the Creature (or worm) is almost dead or dying. He's over thinking the over ending result of the failed attempt to take over everything. Then there is The Reflecting God, a song about the worm, hoping he can get it all back and reassuring himself. This has to be my favorite song every by Manson. The album closes with Man That You Fear, the song is basically showing that after several attempts the worm is dead and gone, the world is dead. Everything is gone.<br /><br />Overall, please stop being close minded and give this a try. Superb production and writing. Great music and instruments. Great overall album. Best by Marilyn Manson (In My Opinion)

B0009I7NNA|3.0|Well, I got the CD and it works, but there is a huge crack on the front cover, and the inner plate is damaged.
B007O3QC8K|5.0|I haven't written a review here for more than five years--mostly because the comments feature started to turn the reviews section into too much of a snarky message board--but I felt this release warranted some commentary.<br /><br />I used to be a Bruckner Ninth completist, but I have done some \\"weeding\\" in recent wears. For a reference, my 5(ish) favorite recordings are (not necessarily in order): Furthwangler, Barenboim/BPO, Haitink's 2nd CO recording, Wand's 1994 NDRSO recording, Sknowaczewski's Minnesota recording, Giulini/VPO.<br /><br />I feel that when reviewing a \\"completed\\" version of the 9th, the first thing we should do is rate the performance of the first 3 movements on their own merits, and not deduct points for the conductor's decision to include the finale.<br /><br />I am not approaching this review as a Rattle fan, and I definitely approached this recording with some caution...but I do admire Rattle's courage in including the finale, and the fact that EMI managed to get this on one disc.<br /><br />I have my own issues with the \\"completion,\\" and the various and sundry versions of it, as well as how I feel it should be executed, but I won't get into that here. Suffice it to say that I am a \\"Brucknerd\\" who used to be opposed to messing around with the original 3-movement format...but over time I have decided that the material that Bruckner left us for the finale--choppy though it may be--is definitely worth hearing (esp. the radiant chorale theme)...as long as we approach it as more of a \\"study\\" than a definitve statement. The most debatable point is what is the proper context for hearing the finale, and I think that will forever remain a point of debate among \\"Brucknerds.\\"<br /><br />Now, all of that mumbo jumbo aside, I feel that this is a fabulous performance. Great sound, radiant playing, and a truly well-conceived interpretation. As is often the case with live recordings, there might not be ideal clarity of textures in climaxes, and the first movement coda; but the horns sound great, the strings are rapt, and the timpani has plenty of power (many an otherwise-good Bruckner performance has been sunk by weak timpani, but that is not the case here).<br /><br />As far as that subjective element, of \\"spiritual terror\\"--which other reviewers have mentioned, and that I have waxed poetic about in other reviews--while this performance is not as hair-raising as, say, Furtwangler or Barenboim/BPO, it is not completely bereft of that element either. This is definitely Bruckner in the more \\"picturesque\\" vein, but not without it's moments of darkness and brooding.<br /><br />Although, as I said above, I am no longer a Bruckner 9th completist--and I haven't even purchased a new one in a few years--but when the BPO became the first \\"first rank\\" orchestra to record the finale, I decided it was enough of an occasion to make the purchase...and I am completely satisfied!<br /><br />I don't really want to get into the debate about the merits of a \\"completed\\" finale, except to reiterate that I'm not going to hold it against a conductor for deciding to include it, esp. if the performance of the first 3 movements are good. As far as the present recording goes, I for one, actually like this latest version of the SPCM better than the previous one (the excised \\"bridging\\" material stuck out like a sore thumb, to me). I still don't find any of the \\"completions\\" consistently satisfying or convincing; but I appreciate the opportunity to hear the material, and the efforts of the editors.

For those of you who want to develop your own system this book gives invaluable help. Systems are important because if there are no systems in place, you (the entrepreneur) are always going to be on call. For those of you who already have a small-business, in order to take your business to the next level you need to put quality control in place. Without systems, however, there is no quality control. For these reasons, take a time and read this book, and most importantly apply what it says.

B006Z4LOPK|3.0|While I appreciate the vastly underused (and downright refreshing) Fae atmosphere and intriguing characters within the enriched universe, I have one beef with it. I've been watching the series on SyFy, and enjoy most of the show except for the character Kenzi. Her wit is supposed to be sharp, dark, and self-serving, but I consistently find myself annoyed by her and her actions. More often than not, it's her mistakes that get Bo, Dyson, and others into trouble. I understand she's there to provide the human element (i.e. our gateway into Bo's life), but would it have killed the writers to actually make Kenzi likeable? I continue to watch the show, but think after so many near misses with death, Kenzi would smarten up a bit.
B0052VUNHC|4.0|If you like fights and dysfunction then this book is for you. This was a fun book to read because something is always happening, crying, sex or fights. Loved it.
B006Z476J8|5.0|First of all, I will repeat what others have said about how great this album is. I am lucky enough to have the original UK LP in the round sleeve, and various versions over the years on cassette and CD (including the one in the metal can).<br /><br />I'm writing here today to US readers. I have been meaning to get all 4 of the new Small Faces remasters and was checking the prices (and versions) on Amazon US & Amazon UK. I see that only one of those available through A-US is the UK version. As of today, the US price of the imported UK set is $40.54. WTF?<br /><br />Meanwhile, on A-UK, the price is £13.00 (which as of today is $20.14). Wanting the UK editions I ordered all 4, and the postage was £7.00 ($10.85). Note that if you add that postage (which was for all 4 sets) to the cost of just 'Ogden's', the total is $30.99 (and presumably the postage on only 'Ogden's' would be less than £7.00). Almost $10.00 less (before tax).<br />So if you don't care about waiting a few weeks longer, it definitely pays to order this set from Amazon UK.<br /><br />And meanwhile, if you want to order all 4 sets, if you order from Amazon US, as of today, it will cost you $105.46 before tax, and if you live in a taxable state like mine, it would be be more -  in my case $8.44, for a total of $113.90. And 3 of those sets will be the US versions! It cost me $82.27 total for all 4 UK sets from Amazon UK. This was a savings over A-US of $31.63!!!<br /><br />So, again, if you don't mind waiting longer (and saving a scheißeload of money), your best bet is to buy all the Small Faces remasters from Amazon UK. Sorry Amazon US!
0393088774|3.0|Traditional Keynesian economics - whether you agree with all of that or not is a topic for another debate, but on the merits of the books itself, I found it economically, and theoretically correct.  However, Krugman's political bias gets in the way of his argument, and in the end, he seems to end up attacking a straw-man.  Like most centrists out there, I have trouble believing most prognostications about the future from most overt-political rhetoric.
B004SH40BQ|5.0|This little adapter is AMAZING! It took no time to pair with the Sennheiser MM 400 headphones which are also great! The price was a little high but it was DEFINATY WORTH IT!! Big things really do come in small packages! :-)
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book is a page turner. I couldn't put it down. I highly recommend it for both sexes. Ita intense and loving at the same time. I absoloutely loved reading every single word in the book. Pick up a copy and read it. Deff worth the time
0307346617|5.0|This book was a great read and with the interview setting, you don't get lost in lengthy chapters just trying to make it to the end.  It's hard to put down and giving the story from so many global points of perspective really give a picture of a post-zombie-war earth.  It does leave you desiring to know more details, but many of the interviews were very descriptive and put you right in the heat of the battle.  UNDERWATER ZOMBIES!!! Who would have thought!!!  I'll never swim in the ocean again being brushed by a piece of seaweed and NOT think of the submarine chapter!  I've also heard great reviews of the audio book for this one as well.
B007ZRZF8I|4.0|Great game overall, good replayability, and the factoring of velocity into the movement of the character adds a great feel.
B000H4QD1O|5.0|Firefly is absolutely amazing. It is the best Sci-fi TV show ever written. Each episode is fun, imaginative, and reveals additional layers of depth to each of the characters.Its heartbreaking the series was aborted due to a irresponsible tv network and its marketers.
0345803485|1.0|Absolute trash- don't waste your money folks! The author's inner goddess must be totally messed up to pen this atrocity. Unfortunately porn sells.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|Worse book I ever read! I feel like the author should personality hand me a refund and a detail, sincere, genuine, long ass apology for the time I spent reading this crap. The writing was horrible and the constant saying of \\"oh my...\\" makes me want to pound my head into a wall.<br /><br />I WILL NOT BE BUYING THE OTHER TWO BOOKS! I rather spend my money on something like...socks.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|This movie is absolutely meant as a starting-off place for a new branch of the Alien story. It isn't a reboot, but a different fork taken. I like the idea of what could be to come in a future sequel. Remember that though the first alien movie had many characters, subsequent movies focused predominantly on Ripley. This one will certainly focus on the two best developed characters from this one in future movies, with a chance to tie in with the Alien series at the end. I have to revisit the first Alien movie to see the tie-in to this point, but it definitely takes place before the first movie and at least in part explains the Alien characters.<br /><br />Complaints about low character development may be justified to some extent, but there was so much crammed into the movie that it would have to be another hour long and not move the story along fast enough for most movie-goers to satisfy those who have issue with it. I think it would be great for those who are big Alien fans to get a directors cut similar to the Lord Of The Rings, but that's not going to matter a lot to the general movie going public.<br /><br />I am not Christian, but did not feel the religious subplot was in any way detrimental to the film - it feels very personal to the central character and an interesting point.<br /><br />Many reviewers seem to think that the Race before us was sending us very mixed messages. I believe future movies will reveal warring factions amongst them. Do we really think other races don't have devisions, no matter how advanced?<br /><br />A lot of questions to debate until the next one and the potential for grand space opera to be played out boggles my mind. I was left thinking - gee, I can't wait for the next one!

B003K16P3M|5.0|Amazing story! A must read. Unique enough to keep my attention through all 3 books from this author. Loved every minute.
B005M2A4D4|5.0|Although I've already watched this series on my computer I loved it so much I had to buy it for myself, and now I'm eagerly waiting for the next season to come out. I do like Russel T. Davies writing better though. Steven Moffat is great at plot twists, but he doesn't work in much references to the previous series, which saddens me. However, in the end Moffat really keeps you interested with his twists and turns and following his storyline throughout each season. And Although the 10th Doctor, David Tennant, will always be my favorite (though he was not my first Dr) I do love Matt Smith as the 11th Dr!
B007SGM084|4.0|Love this story, the caracters really grow on you. The 1st book was a little slow and I really needed to push myself to continue reading ( to similar to twilight)? When reading this series you have to put aside the writing and just go with the story line. The 2nd and 3rd books are much better, the story goes in a new direction and by this point you just want to figure out why Christian is who he his! So much starts to happen that you just need to read it, making it a book you can't put down.
B005CFVSYK|5.0|Wedge is great height for us \\"mature\\" girls. Not too sporty and dressier than a flat Croc, yet still comfy.The fit is true to size in Crocs.LOVE IT !!!
0345803485|5.0|I have read the whole Trilogy. I started it 3 days ago, and I seriously fell in love.  This book kept me hooked the whole time. I was actually a little worried about reading this, because of the comments people were saying. I'm glad i dind't listen to them!These books are amazing in my opinion. I really wish she didn't end it with just the 3rd book! I strongly recommend this book ! :)
B00756GKBA|5.0|Album has nice gems like Turn up the radio, Gang Bang and Love spent, also I am a sinner is good sound thanks to William Orbit, this is type of album that gets better over time, well produced and has catchy songs, not my favourite madonna album, but I love madonna and people who leave 1 star here are not madonna fans and I wouldn't be surprised if they never actually listened to this album
B0054JZC6E|5.0|If you need a way to pass you time this is a good game to install on your device, very interesting and engaging
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Don't waste your money.  This book is so painfully BAD, it makes me wonder how on earth it ever got published.  Clearly the author and editor were out sick the day their teachers taught simple sentence structure.  Basic rules of good writing have been thrown out the window.  If you enjoy a fun summer read this is not the book, unless of course you are a naughty 13 year old.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really like this game. it is really fun. the only thing that I don't like is that you have to buy the games other than that this game is outstanding

B007N0REX6|5.0|As a huge fan of Alter Bridge, I was slightly skeptical of how this album would turn out.  I was stuck wondering whether it would sound too much like Alter Bridge or too much like Guns and Roses.  Luckily, I surprised when I heard a perfect medium between the two.  Myles has a voice that tells a story.  One of excitement, youth, pain, life, etc. Slash has guitar playing skills that also tell a similar story.  Put those two together, along with some pretty awesome lyrics, and you have yourself an awesome rock album.  If I could go back in time to the early 90's, this album would fit right in with the rest of the rock greats of that era.  It almost makes me wish I had a tape cassette player and cassette version of the album.  Very nostalgic.  Well done Myles and Slash.  Well done.<br /><br />Songs to listen to:<br />Far and Away<br />Not For Me<br />One Last Thrill<br />You're A Lie<br />Anastasia<br />Bad Rain<br /><br />**Update**<br /><br />I have had this album for over three months now and it is still played once a day while at work.  Far and Away has easily become my favorite song on the album.  Myles Kennedy belts out the lyrics beautifully and is backed by an unbelievable guitarist.  I recently saw them perform this album at the Welmont Theatre in New York.  Good lord was it awesome. These guys are having fun, and they make sure to give back to their fans by putting on an amazing show.  You need to own this CD/Album!
0345803485|5.0|This is defo a bored housewife book and its reading is left to the imagination! It's fab! (not to say I am a bored housewife) haha!<br />It is Saucey and classy and should be given to men of age to learn about women's bodies! Haha! Well done!
0143119680|2.0|Let's see: The heroine is beautiful, with strands of hair in every color imaginable.  She's brilliant.  She's athletic and she has almost every known power that a witch can possibly have (and since there are sequels forthcoming, probably more even than that).  She's got tenure and teas and access to every manuscript imaginable. So what could possibly be missing?  Oh, yeah, a boyfriend/husband who is a vampire...<br /><br />  I had no initial negative bias toward this book.  On the contrary, I really like reading books by authors who are also academics, since they are usually nice and thick and well-researched.  I think I was expecting something like The Historian, but instead I got Twilight: The Ten-Year Reunion.<br /><br />  I actually enjoyed the attention to given to detail in some cases.  She does have a knack of describing every taste of wine and bite of food that protagonist Diana enjoys with Matthew.  But some scenes were just ridiculous, like a visit to a vampire yoga class.  All in all the book was probably twice as long as it needed to be, and that is being generous.<br /><br />  Others have said it better than I have, but I will summarize thus:  If you are looking for a book with a strong female character who can manage to go through life without taking up with some controlling supernatural character or another, you won't find it here. And if you want beach reading or something, there are many much shorter books to read.
B004A8ZWSS|4.0|I have been reading all the reviews and don't get the hate.  The movie was not that bad, actually it was pretty entertaining.  Could have been a better script and better acting.  However, I felt that Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie both had good presence and kept me interested in them and the movie.
B0086700CM|5.0|I'm so glad this finally came out for the Amazon App Store! I love love love this game! It never gets old!
B0086700CM|5.0|This is one of my new addictions. Reminds me of bit.trip.runner in a good way. I think the only difference that stands out in my mind is that TR doesn't choreograph the moves you make with music because the path changes every time you start over. There is even an objective that pokes fun at the similarities. This game is outstanding and worth wasting countless hours on.
B0088LU3P0|5.0|I assume that most people reading these reviews know about the episode.  Of all the male characters on the show, Lane has been the most endearing for me.  Basically a decent guy, it was heartbreaking to see him make such an irredeemable mistake.  Of all the names to forge--how different it might have been had he forged Cooper's name.  It was so sad to see Joan give him such a brusque brush-off.  She seems to be smarting and nervous about last week's \\"sellout\\" and perhaps that explains her failure to ask Lane about something that had to have been bothering him deeply--why else would he be drunk at 9am?  I though the dialogue between him and Don was masterful, some of the series' best writing.  Don's assurance that \\"this is the worst part\\" shows a certain understanding on his part; however, Don's failure to understand how Lane (with an impossible wife and an abusive, nightmare father) will react to his dismissal shows up his very real blind spots with regard to the vulnerability of others.  I thought Betty's reaction to her daughter's news was spot on, and the character of Glen is evolving in an interesting direction.  Season 5 seemed quite boring in the early episodes, but the last three have been exceptional.
B007QRKM6M|2.0|Story premise could have been interesting but it progressed too slowly due to an effort to tie together every fairy tale anyone might have ever heard of in their childhood. Special effects, makeup and costuming were too extreme.
B000VSAEYI|5.0|Title says it all pretty much :)  I got this as a gift for my god son who is two.  My friend says that even she likes to get in it with him.  I can't comment on durability as she has only had it for about a month.  It keeps him entertained, out of the house, and cool - so far so good :)
1439127700|5.0|I'm old enough to remember the most of the matters covered in this book.  Still, I learned things about the various presidents that gave me a whole new outlook on their personalities, etc. that I didn't have before.  Very much enjoyed \\"The Presidents Club\\" and highly recommend it.
B000I5XDXS|4.0|Having bought the Toto: Falling in Between video, I was expecting to see camera work and stage setups that were similar (cool stage setup, good closeups of solos, etc.).<br /><br />What surprised me about this concert footage - filmed in Amsterdam at Heineken Music Hall, which if they used the big hall, seats about 5500 people. The audience certainly looked to be packed to standing room only - was the low-key stage set. No fancy fireworks displays, no big sculptures, no cheesy swings, etc. In short, I think that part of this anniversary tour was to give the fans MORE MUSIC and less \\"popcorn\\". Who could argue with that offering? Not me, that's for sure!<br /><br />I like the focus on delivering more music to the fans without the unnecessary distractions or interruptions; after 25 years of creating and producing music, you realize there just isn't a substitute for great music, and any gimmick that detracts from the music itself - takes your attention away from the fact that most of the time, there's very little substance to the show. Toto's 25th Anniversary DVD gives us the good stuff without the filler or meat byproducts.<br /><br />I've never been a medley fan, especially when some of my favorite tunes get thrown into the medley-masher. Because of the large body of work that Toto has recorded over the years, obviously you just can't play EVERY song the fans want to hear. There just isn't time! So, we get these 3-5 minute medleys that hint at 5 or 6 songs each. What Toto does better than most bands I've heard that jam their best-known songs into medleys is this - their improvisational skills can take the songs on wildly different tangents across numerous genres (classical, jazz, prog rock, hard rock) and smoothly rein it all back in for the next song's opening notes. I have to pause here and critcize many of the so-called critics, who always seem to give Toto a hard time - either they're way too professional (e.g., they RARELY make mistakes during performances, everything in concert sounds AS GOOD AS STUDIO recordings, etc.) and therefore are \\"boring\\" and \\"lifeless\\" on stage, or their music just doesn't appeal to the US audiences the way it resonantes with European or Japanese audiences.<br /><br />Critics aren't always correct. Why does a band have to do more than play the music that captivated their fans and listeners? isn't it enough to watch these pros do their thing - and trust me, as a musician, I want to watch the performers PLAY, to see how they do it. I don't care if a light show or skits or fireworks augment the reality of the music. Those are all nice touches, but not a requirement. To all the critics...get a life. If you complain about how \\"out of breath\\" David or Bobby seem, complain about \\"oh, they've gained some WEIGHT\\"...what, are you immune to aging and weight gain, too? Pfft.<br /><br />I tried all three sound options: PCM, 5.1, and DTS - settled on the DTS setting as I felt it gave the best response to my Samsung system. Simon Phillips mixed and edited this video, and while I found no fault with his work, I can't understand why others have issues with this disc's audio and/or visual performance. I no picture quality issues, and never noticed the audio track sounding off, flat, muffled, or the like. Could be that picking this up nine years after its initial release may have something to do with the mastering quality.<br /><br />I won't bore you with my track-by-track impressions, but suffice it to say that the artistry and skills demonstrated by every member of the band makes this video worth the price alone. I haven't seen this kind of musicianship in a live setting in a very long time. You have simply got to see some of the solos that Steve Lukather plays. Also check out the Mike Porcaro/Simon Phillips soloing during the second medley that begins at the midpoint of the concert. As the sign held upu by one of the fans in the crowd says: NEVER ENOUGH TOTO...I almost wish that particular medley could have goneon for another 5 minutes or so. It's just that damn good.<br /><br />Last thing I want to say about this video - they should have left the \\"bonus material\\" of the behind-the-scenes clips of their tour off this disc. While I laughed a lot watching it, I found it to be childish and often downright insulting to me as a fan. That the home video footage had to be preceded by a warning - YES, A WARNING - that the following is not suitable nor appropriate for anything but adult audiences should have clued them in to leave it out. I don't care that it's just \\"boys being boys\\". They're supposed to be professionals, and even though I think it was funny and would probably do the same things as them, it's crude, crass, and definitely does not present the band members in the best light.<br /><br />MINUS ONE FOR THE STUPID BEHIND-THE-SCENES TOUR FOOTAGE (my advice - just forget that this is on the disc, and do your best to avoid watching it)<br /><br />Otherwise, I love love love this concert video.on for another 5 minutes or so.

0345803485|1.0|Ok, so I'm 80% into this book,trying to finish it because it cost $9.99, and if she mentions her \\"inner goddess \\"one more time I think  will up chuck. This book is very annoying, one minute she's a novice drinker, the following chapters she's downing wine or cosmos like a pro. Make up your mind....THERE IS NO WAY I WILL PUT MYSELF THROUGH TWO MORE OF THESE BOOKS EVEN IF THEY WERE FREE.......DRIVEL, DRIVEL, DRIVEL.  I've decided not to even finish this book....the author should roll HER eyes so someone can slap HER around!  THIS IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THE DUMBING DOWN OF AMERICA, WHAT CRAP!
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I had switched from colornote to Evernote because of the fancyness of it. But now that app is getting rather troublesome. I never had any problems with this app. The only thing that is worthwhile about Evernote is that you can access multiple devices with it. ^^ but I'm sticking to colornote now
B005LAIHSG|3.0|Overall, Snow White is an entertaining two hours, but I can't oooh and ahhh without some ughs. This flick boasts some sweet and creepy special effects like mysterious black shards that obey an evil queen and a magnificent black cloak. I jumped with surprise more than once and shuddered a bit, too, as the effects often came out of nowhere. The overall feel of the film is dark. The story is well told with some fascinating additions to/and twists on the classic tale. Plenty of battle scenes (fast, clashing action with the hyperspeed that is popular of late) and heroes give the film plenty of edge-of-the- seat action.<br /><br />Charlize Theron is in top form as she gives pure evil a wee bit of heart, even while she snacks on a few. This evil queen is helped in her quest for \\"fairest in all the land\\" (and for all eternity) by her creepy, enabling brother. Did I mention it was a dark film...not kidding about snacking on hearts. Kristen Stewart cuts the cords that bind her to Twilight and shines in several scenes. Chris Hemsworth plays a terrific anti-hero.<br /><br />My complaint is that the film contained a few scenes that cluttered the experience for me. I believe there was an attempt to lighten up the intensity with some frivolous good magic and whimsy. But those moments were a head-scratching distraction that took away from the story. I was willing to suspend disbelief regarding Snow White's condition after being imprisoned for years and her enchanted escape, but balked at some of the other more whimsical moments.<br /><br />I still consider Snow White an entertaining take on the fairy tale and I loved the effects. It's too dark for sensitive kids (and adults). And the whimsical moments (let's just say Troll Whisperer may be on Snow White's resume) may annoy those really looking for some otherwise satisfying visual artistic escapism.
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|An amazing addition to the Outlander series.  Just love the way Diana Gabaldon makes you feel like you are right there with the characters.
B003ES61EE|4.0|Estoy muy satisfecho con el producto, nos ha servido mucho y fue entregado justo en el tiempo estimado. seguiremos comprando productos similares
0345803485|3.0|I agree with other reviewers. Half the time I think that a teenager is writing this, and the rest of the time I am annoyed at ALL OF THE REPETITION. It's slowly driving me crazy. Also, it takes place in Washington, but there are British words and idioms dropped every few pages. That annoys me a lot. I thought I would give the 2nd book a shot, and the plot is better, but it's much of the same. If you can get past the annoying phrases and repeated words, then maybe you can get to the plot.
B0086700CM|4.0|temple run is an awesome little game that will have you addicted for the longest. if you need something to do temple run is the thing to do.
B0082JYEEO|2.0|As much as I hate to admit it, this album is not up to standard with what we know she can come up with. She's incredibly talented and I LOVE all her previous albums. But as soon as I saw her video for 'Rowboats' and how marketable they made her look, I knew it was over. For goodness sake, even Mike Elizondo said that he was trying to produce this album so it would reach people who hadn't otherwise heard of Regina or her music! If that doesn't seem like a huge red flag then I don't know what is. If you haven't heard of her, that's your own freaking fault, I mean, it's obvious that you don't seek good music in that case. The songs on the albums sound cheesy with the over-production. It's not needed and they didn't use it to correctly vamp up a song or give it more complexity like on 'Apres Moi' or 'Summer in the City'. As soon as I hear all that, I just had an immediate reaction to it, like my brain refuses to accept the extra layering as believable. It just doesn't work. She already has a really interesting and complex voice and piano-playing. She didn't need all that glossiness. Some songs lend themselves to some beautiful moments but then are ruined right at the brink of them reaching their glory. They are ruined by these cheesy, meandering snippets and lyrics that are not up to par with what she is capable of doing. I don't know, I also feels like she holds back, she doesn't sing without restraint like she does on some of the bootleg versions I've heard of the 'Rowboats' song, or even 'Genius Next Door.' Although I feel like 'Far' had some of that problem, the lyrics were still superb and the production didn't sound (I hate to repeat myself but alas...) cheesy. I mean, I have a copy of 'Oh Marcello' that has really bad sound quality but it's magical! A few songs on this album are pretty good but where great before all this over-kill. As much as it hurts to say this, I only give this album 2.5 stars. The cover also looks kinda dumb to me, I don't know why. (I guessit doesn't really matter, just felt like saying it). It breaks my heart but it's just not up to her usual standards. :'(
0345803485|3.0|This book is okay...just okay.<br /><br />One fault is that it is a book published on the cheapest of paper...you can see through it making the ink on the pages light and hard to read! There is no other hard copies available for purchase except for a Kindle version.<br /><br />While I prefer to read a 'real' book, this appears to be  a way to promote all 'e-readers' as no other written version is available except for the Kindle version.<br /><br />The subject matter of the story itself is not up to romance standards.  And since  I have written better romance stories WITH better erotic sex scenes I can say this: This book falls flat!<br /><br />As I said, it is okay, but not one of the best I have read!  I don't see what all the 'hoopla' was about? I guess the publisher has a good promotional department! Maybe I should contact them to promote my next written work.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|great when it functions correctly- has issues with kindle fire.  internet related issues mostly.  other than that great fun game

0345529057|4.0|Great collection of books and at a great price. Highly recommended for anyone newly getting into the series. These books are absolutely as advertised easy to follow, and perfectly good read.
B005M2OIB8|5.0|The delivery happend really fast, in a nice package. The movie covers any expectations, great quality of blu-ray. Probably this is the best of all X-Men saga, great shots, effects, even the performances....If you never watched any of them, this could be a great beginning...dont miss it!!
B004J4WNL2|5.0|Are you an introvert or have one in your family / group of friends?  This book helps you to understand what makes them tick.  We as introverts are not broken, we're just as valuable as extroverts.  Who'd have thought?  Excellent read indeed!
B003EY7IRC|5.0|Loved loved this series.. would love to read more about Jericho or more on Vlane's past. This series did not disappoint.
B0054TVW04|5.0|Ferguson, a great historian, in this insightful work identifies six factors propelling western civilization to ascendance over the past five centuries.  He presents cohesive analysis based on historical facts supporting his persuasive thesis.  Other cultures are missing some or all of the six factors.  The comparative results are evident everywhere.<br /> Some negative reviewers, purveyors of contemptible sophistries like multiculturalism, are enraged by facts contradicting their delusions.  They believe their fantasies about how the world should work trump the reality of the way it does work.  This evokes disastrous utopian schemes from the likes of Plato, Rousseau, Marx, and dozens of lesser known psychopathic control freaks.<br /> Some reviewers' negative comments suggest they haven't even read the book, but are exploiting this forum to vent their polemics.  Others, unable to refute facts, resort to personal attacks on the author.<br /> As William James observed, \\"A great many people think they are thinking when they are merely rearranging their prejudices.\\"
B007N85ZXY|4.0|Reuniting with Crazy Horse for the first time in nearly a decade, Americana's ragged riffs, raspy vocals, and untamed guitar solos reminds us why Neil Young has been called the Godfather of Grunge.  This is classic Neil Young - raw, unpolished, passionate - just a guy and his band who loves to rock and is clearly having fun doing it - putting a new and refreshing twist, the kind of twist that is patently Neil Young - on a a surprising collection of American folk favorites that feels a lot more like \\"Cinnamon Girl\\" than Steven Foster, Americana disassembles and puts back together childhood favorites like \\"Oh, Susannah,\\" \\"Clementine (my favorite in a strong field), \\"Tom Dula (Dooley?),\\" \\"Wayfaring Stranger\\" and seven others.  The addition of 50s be bop hit \\"Get a Job\\" is a strange choice in the otherwise country folk twang, but nonetheless benefits from Young's unique interpretation.  Whether for singing along on that road trip, kicking back with a Jack Daniels, or backdrop to the weekly poker game, Americana fits the bill - it's great having Neil Young back with Crazy Horse.  Looking forward to the tour.
B0083GR6Y6|3.0|When I saw a movie starring Liam that featured wolves, I was all in! The scenery was fabulous. The story was ok. Liam Neeson, as always, gave a stellar performance. The wolves weren't as realistic as they could have been.<br /><br />The ending was predictable and leaves you dangling. I really don't like that in movies...it's a personal pet peeve. Overall, it is worth watching...just prepare yourself to be left hanging at the end.
B0053O89KG|3.0|Let me start off by saying I love Castle.  Love, love, love it.  Pink, puffy-heart love it even.  I have watched from day 1 and have nearly worn out my DVD's of seasons 1-3.  Season 4 though was such a let down.  There were so few episodes that showed any growth in the characters and all the interruptions and secrets and misunderstanding (oh, my!) were just annoying.  One conversation between Castle and Beckett could have cleared up everything and allowed the viewers a season a season of fun Castle-y goodness.  Instead we got mostly sad, down trodden, puppy dog eyed Castle, with none of the zip of the first 3 seasons.<br />There can still be serious, angsty episodes (see seasons 1-3), but with sad Castle, they were too heavy.  Even the funny episodes were blah for the most part.  Castle was too reserved for my tastes and the entire season was more about Beckett than Castle.  If they wanted a Beckett-centric show they should have called it Beckett and not Castle.<br /><br />This isn't to say there weren't some good episodes:<br />Rise<br />Heroes and Villains<br />Kick in the Ballistics<br />Eye of the Beholder<br />Demons<br />Cops and Robbers<br />Kill Shot<br />Dial 'M' for Mayor<br />An Embarrassment of Bitches<br />Once Upon a Crime<br />Dance with Death<br />47 Seconds<br />Headhunters (guest starring Adam Baldwin from Firefly)<br />Undead Again<br />Always<br /><br />That's 15 out of 23 episodes and some of those were borderline, IMO.  For me the only real stand outs from the list above are Cops and Robbers, 47 seconds, Headhunters and the absolutely delicious Always.  The writers seemed to look for any and every possible thing to throw in Castle and Beckett's way to keep them from talking out their issues and honestly it got tiresome.  For every step they took forward, they took 5 or 6 steps backward.  Ugh.  Lack of continuity was another issue this season.  Don't the writers even watch their own show?<br />While I still love the show overall, I was sorely disappointed in season 4 and I'm going to try really, really hard to forget that Heartbreak Hotel was every made.  I will own this season, if for no other reason than to watch Always 857,000 times, but I'm still disappointed.<br />I have cautiously high hopes for season 5.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This game is awesome. I only wish there were save points while working on the puzzles. 1 slip of the finger and your not sure what was damaged. Over all I loved it and look forward to more.
B007MAETA8|4.0|Love the alternate version of Born and Raised (reprise).  I like the country flavor to the album.  I bought one for my niece but she informed me she doesn't like him so I'll have to find someone to give the extra copy to.
B0073PPKNM|3.0|When I first saw the cover art for this CD I was worried. I had loved Melodys first two CDs and was very much looking forward to this release. Unfortunately it's not as exotic or as sexy as the cover would lead you to believe, not as lush or romantic as 'My One And Only Thrill nor is it as intimate as 'Worrisome Heart'. I was expecting a concept album with echoes of Sinatra's Jobim album but the songs just dont seem to add up to anything greater when listened to as a whole.  I wanted to like it more just expected a bigger follow up from her last CD.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I love this app and my kindle fire. I needed a radio after my cable tv was out for several days so I bought a vintage sears silvertone console stereo at the thrift store for $25 dollars plugged it in and I had radio like it was suppose to sound. But my favorite smooth jazz station would only come in in the evenings my son put on a external antenna still not clear so he told me to go buy a aux cable and plug my kindle fire into the stereo and boy do I have the best sounding music ever from london orlando everywhere so clear its like the band in in my living room. Thank you Tunein radio for making my old stereo come alive again.
B005DC68NI|5.0|This is a must read if you are considering publishing an e book. The info is great and it also leads you to other sources of info just as good.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love the game! I have been going crazy for this app and wanting it to come to the amazon app store. I'm so glad I finally got it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a really great app...my home Bible study has been revived as I have continued with my Bible reading plan....100% recommended
0345803485|1.0|Not to be repetitive as the book is and everyone else's comments but, this series was recommended to me through some friends. I am an avid reader and try to read a variety of books as well as come up with my own opinions. I have never written a review, however this series was so disastrous I strongly suggest you don't waste your time.<br /><br />1. Characters are boring, they really have the opportunity to be interesting, but they aren't. I kept hoping they would be as the series continued, but alas, they were not. Someone should write fan fiction based on these characters and their backgrounds. Of course if the characters are based off the twilight characters, the author she have much to go on since they also weren't complex. But that should be a different review.<br />2. The expectations set in the book are unrealistic all around<br />A. . How do either of these people have lives/work? All they do is have unrealistic sex, everywhere. They have a huge fight; well clearly sex will fix his crazy and her insecurities. As well as this girl can have an orgasm at the drop of a hat. I feel bad for anyone using this book to set their own expectations, this is not real. Do they have other interests?<br />B. She is a college grad that becomes the acting Chief of a publishing company??? What?? AFTER ONE WEEK?!!?<br />C. Getting married after what 2 months? Clearly the 50% divorce rate in the US as well as he's a crazy control freak makes this a smart idea.<br />D. Is he bad at anything? Well I mean, other than chopping vegetables...<br />It got so repetitive that I eventually started skipping the sexual parts. It was interesting at first and then all the oh mys, flushing, blushing, Mr Greys, sirs, lip biting, etc were just words. There's rarely any build up. You know basically every time they are about to have sex, other than it happens every 5 pages. I think another reviewer said it best, that when you take out all of sex and repetition, you have 50 pages worth of an interesting read in the series.<br /><br /> Please, please don't bother paying for these books or reading them. If you manage a free copy, by all means try it out, like I did. It says something quite terrible about us as a whole that this terrible writing is on the best seller list. The most interesting thing about the book is to make fun of how utterly ridiculous it is.<br /><br />Put the book down and go chase some butterflies, it would most likely be more entertaining and less predictable
B00881VLCE|4.0|I tried a different puzzle app previously but there wasn't much to it. This one was easy to use but I found the pieces would not rotate and occasionally were hard to move onto the board. Still, it was a lot of fun.

B005KDWUFA|1.0|Any mentored,sanctioned, and protogeed by cheezmeister Simon Cowell is absurdly horrible. Just listen to this steaming heap of easy listening carburator dung!btw there's another copycat band singing horrible \\"opera pop\\", the worst genre to rear it's ugly head since i don't know what! just a hint, any band who's name begins with 'il' (ie-il volo, il divo)just run the other way! it's like muric acid being placed into your ears with a dropper!
0061452068|2.0|While Matt Ridley makes a compelling case that technology and the free market have allowed humankind to progress in remarkable ways, he appears to be willfully ignorant of many very real environmental concerns of today. Although I do not pretend to understand the field of economics, I do know a bit about environmental protection, and in almost all cases when he writes of the environment, he is simply wrong about the cause, effect, and solutions to environmental issues. The author's mistakes are far too numerous to describe here, but the most glaring are his apparent disregard to challenges concerning food production, sufficient water supply, biodiversity and habitat loss, and global warming.<br /><br />Mr. Ridley does manage to stop embarrassing himself by providing an insightful sentence, which goes along the lines of \\"Of course things are going to get worse if we continue doing things as we always have been.  But of course, we never do continue in the future as we have always done in the past - if something is unsustainable, we simply find a solution and proceed.\\" He points out that every pessimist has been wrong in the past, from Malthus (food shortages), to Ehrlich (population bomb), to the New York City official who lamented in the early 1900s that the streets of New York \\"would be covered in ten feet of horse manure\\" in a few decades if the horse traffic population continued to grow as it had been.<br /><br />Mr. Ridley unnecessarily criticizes environmentalists.  He may be surprised to realize that without environmentalists, many of us in the Western World would still be drinking contaminated water and breathing poisonous air (does anybody believe that the air in Beijing is actually good for you?). So, if you are an apologist for an unfettered free market, this book may be to your liking.  If you prefer a more reasoned, balanced approach to the subject, I highly recommend a similar book that is more \\"rational\\", called \\"Abundance:  Why the Future is Better than You Think\\".  \\"Abundance\\" is extremely positive and hopeful on the future, without falling prey to ideological myopia.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is so much fun my whole family plays. hard to get use to at first but loads of fun when you get the hang of it.
B0086700CM|4.0|this game is an awesome game.

B007R3AZNK|4.0|I have all of Joe B.'s albums, and in some ways this one rates close to the top! A nice mix of originals, blues standards, and some more obscure covers. All very well done! The BEST thing about it is that there is no orchestral arrangements muddying up the raw materials of blues-rock: guitar, bass, drums and a B3 organ! The last few of Joe's albums had too much orchestration for my tastes...sometimes I wondered if I was listening to Joe Bonamassa or Mantovani--lol.<br /><br />I can think of a hotter blues cover that he could have picked besides Who's Been Talkin', however. It's a great song, and I love Howlin' Wolf, but I think the basic beat of that song doesn't lend itself too well to bone-crushin' blues-rock. In my opinion, the arrangement of the original is more effective. I like the Robert Johnson cover of Stones In My Passway, though...sounds like what Led Zeppelin did to blues back in the late 60's...great stuff!<br /><br />Joe's playing is fantastic on this CD, of course, even if he doesn't \\"step out of the box\\" too much...he seems to do that more on his live recordings, so it all balances out overall. :-)<br /><br />The last song sung by Jimmy Barnes (who does a GREAT job) is an awesome that I never heard of...co-written by Barnes and some of the members of Journey. Interesting collaboration...but it does have a bit of that 80's sound to it...great song!<br /><br />I wouldn't say this album ranks alongside some of his earlier efforts, like So It's Like That, Had To Cry Today or Blues Deluxe, but it comes pretty close! You gotta love Joe's dedication lately to churning those albums out for us hungry fans...between his solo efforts and Black Country Communion, he's been going nonstop, it seems! RECOMMENDED for Joe B. fans!
B007ZRZF8I|5.0|This game is one of the best multiplayer games for friends and family. It's great for a party especially on the Kindle with a much better screen. The game has great graphics and its smooth and gives you handi caps like slowmotion to help you in the game. You can buy more if you need them but 10 is enough.. The game is supposed to be challenging. I don't know why people are complaining about having to buy more handi caps. If you can't beat the adventure mode with 10 slow motions then buy more not a big deal.. and its bot much.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. Yes it was daring and sexy, but also honest.  Jealousy, insecurity and exes all make this read feel more real.<br /><br />The book was sexy, exciting and entertaining:)
B005723JSQ|4.0|I haven't laughed out loud this often while reading a book since the 1st Bridget Jones novel. IGYN is a good, light, summer-read type of book & I'm quite enjoying it (about 2/3-way through). I wonder if there's any noise about making a movie of this story? If so, who should be cast. How about Hugh Jackman in the role of Sam?
B000XR4OC0|1.0|What can I say about Toms Customer Service? Totally hopeless and non-existant. If you have any sort of problem with Toms, that requires an intervention at even the simplest level (such as exchanging a size) then do not expect any help at all.<br />Toms have a system they call \\"Customer Happiness\\", actually it should be called \\"Ignore Customers at all Costs\\".<br />They have a system called Live Help, but there is no-one alive on the other end, be prepared to be alive on your end for at least an hour or two!<br />They have a system for e-mailing customer service - do not expect a reply within two weeks, more likely expect no reply at all.<br /><br />They say that they have a team of young and savvy customer happiness professionals, I call it \\"sharp, beligerant dim wits\\".

0783226845|5.0|This Amazon DVD is a true classic! AL Pacino is no doubt one of the greatest actors of our generation. He has the ability to \\"truly  become\\" the character he portrays  but in  a \\"magical  way\\". you are able to see both the actor and the man, become one!<br />It is difficult to \\"play\\" a blind person,.....yet he does it with such ease that is almost uncanny, as well as realistic .<br /><br />The Tango dance sequence is a \\"gift\\" only a few can obtain . He would be perfect for a spot on \\"Dancing with the Stars\\".<br /><br />The other \\"Double Header\\" is with co- star Chris O'Donnell, who has matured as a classic Actor. This young man is destined to go far in the Movie and TV industry. He has matured and learned his craft well.  The scene where he confronts Pacino about committing suicide is totally real..Chris crosses the \\"line in the sand\\" and goes from actor to co-star in a few seconds.We will be seeing more of this young man in years to come.A truly great motion picture well worth seeing again and again.<br /><br />Seawolf<br />Joe Folino

B005S9EJ14|5.0|I saw TBEMH at a theater in a community well-known for its attractiveness to retirees.  Most of the audience seemed to be over sixty.  I am in my 70s.  The reactions I heard were all about relating to the characters and the dialogue.  Most of the dialogue was more original than Maggie Smith's comment about green bananas, which I've heard dozens of times before.  Having visited northeastern India and felt its overwhelming splendor and squalor, I was reminded of much of what I saw there.  India itself seemed to be one of the characters, and was ably supported by both young and old Indian characters but also stood on its own with the visuals and the cacophony.  The Hindu funeral made me wish I could have one too when my time comes.  This is a movie I will see again and again just for the pleasure of seeing people and places that make me feel that it's really OK to be 70 and \\"out there.\\"

0446572993|5.0|There are so many great things to say about this book I hardly know where to begin.  So I will just keep it brief.  This is the kind of book the grabs you from the beginning and plays out very well.  This writer truly has the gift of telling a great tale.  I don't know how you are but I get bored very easily and if a book doesn't get and hold my interest very quickly I move on.  He had me guessing what would happen next and the ending was a real surprise.  I can't wait until he publishes another in this new series.  I will now have to read the reviews of his many earlier works.<br /><br />I can attest to the authenticity of the main character, Will Robie, because I used do the same job for many of the same people for some of the same reasons.  Mr. Baldacci must have had the genuine article for a consultant to gain the insight into this character's complex personality.
B0086700CM|5.0|temple run is addicting cool and awesome. Challenging yourself is a good thing too. Allnages can play this. Even your grandparents! Try this game.

0765316994|3.0|I really enjoyed the first two-thirds of the book; the story was interesting and well executed. Scalzi does a great job conveying the cognitive dissonance the characters experience as the reality of the situation is revealed. Sadly, the last third of the book was not so enjoyable. IMHO, I would have preferred Scalzi skip the last third and expand the main story.
B007WFQZF0|5.0|Liars are a band I have always paid attention to, always respected, always knew there was something real and interesting going on. It's just that the music, as varied as it has consistently been, never hooked me. That's not to say that their previous albums weren't good or great. They just didn't turn me on enough to stick with them. It was one of those \\"It's not you, it's me\\" situations. However, this album is fantastic and I am glad I kept paying attention.<br /><br />Liars create a mood and atmosphere on this album that has a cinematic feel to it.<br />A score for right now. A right now that is electronic, ominous, multiformed and filled with a kind of dread that only grimy flesh and blood, very imperfect humans feel. If that's you (and it probably should be) I think you will really enjoy this music.<br /><br />As a petty side note, I want to point out to those of us who pay attention to Pitchfork,<br />I think the \\"score\\" they gave this album is dead wrong and off by a mile and one of the reasons I wrote this review.<br />IMO 2012 has been a lackluster year for really interesting and challenging music but this album easily belongs in the top 3 to 5.

B004A8ZWVU|5.0|The Help is an amazing movie!  I can watch it every day.  The acting is superb!!  I definitely recommend buying this movie.
0345803493|2.0|having read the first book in this trilogy, I didn't see what more the author could add sexually.  While the tone softens, the consenting sex between Anastasia and Christian doesn't, however just like having the same meal over and over again, it got boring enough that I found myself skipping over the \\"hot\\" scenes and getting on with the story.  I mean how many times, places and postitions can a sexual act be described?  Actually, I'm surprised ths book got published as the plot became thinner and thinner I struggled to finish the book.
B000V1Z8KK|1.0|Wow!  Hey, let's exhaust every trite Hollywood stereotype in one movie and get it over with.  Its supposed to be HE-E-EAVY M-A-AN but is pure formula pap through and through.  Nuff said since I already wasted my time watching it so may as well not waste time writing about it.
0345803485|2.0|I had seen the book at Costco and thought the cover rather intriguing, but didn't have time to browse through the book. Later, I saw the book on Amazon and read the first three pages.  It interested me enough to purchase the book,  but WOW, I was not prepared for what came after those three pages.  While it is highly sexual there was enough of a plot to keep me going, always curious to see how Anastasia reacted.
1400069289|4.0|Duhigg is a capable writer, and deserves being mentioned in the same breath with Malcolm Gladwell.  If you like Gladwell, you'll probably like this book.  He weaves together tales of what retailers (Target) and manufacturers (P&G) know about their consumers and how they know it, and how people like CEO/Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill use habit modification to transform people and organizations.  This is good, breezy reading, with some practical advice for those who are looking for advice on how to modify their own habits.  Author is a bit disingenuous, suggesting that habit is not much studied, but it has been a popular topic with American writers since at least Benjamin Franklin's Autobiography, which Duhigg does not mention.  Still, it does not pretend to be a self-help book.  It's a good read, can be finished in two or three pleasant evenings, and may provide some good cocktail chatter.
B0086700CM|5.0|you guys have no idea how long I have been waiting for this hale to come avaiable on my kindle fire!!!!! I love it. works Great.....EXCEPT that it kinda freezes up but that's my only complaint .....<br />now what they should do is make a Temple Run2 a sequal! that would be awesome! thanks for making it avaiable on kindle fire!!! :)
B005LAIHXQ|4.0|The prevailing critical opinion about the new movie Prometheus is that it looks great but is underwhelming in the story department, at least compared to the first two Alien movies.  in particular, many comment that there's no cathartic moment like the Ripley \\"Get away from her!\\" scene in Aliens.  I can see some truth in those observations, but there's still enough good stuff in Prometheus that I got a kick out of it.  First, the opening scene is fairly amazing, although I'll admit I still didn't quite understand it, even after watching the entire flick.  Then there's all the sci-fi/tech/CGI elements, which include but aren't limited to how great the ship looks landing on the alien planet, the nifty \\"puppies\\" (flying probes sent out to map the inside of the ancient Engineers' structure), and the automated surgical capsule.  Also, as a fan of the Alien film series (not counting the AvP movies, which are another thing), I appreciated all of the links to the other films, especially the android David and the giant control chair the Engineer sits in.  Whatever Ridley Scott says, Prometheus is certainly an Alien prequel -- the final scene leaves no doubt about that.  In fact, I'd rate it maybe 3rd or 4th best out of the five Alien films.  One negative aspect, though, was the poor or limited use of 3D.  I experimented with briefly removing my 3D glasses every so often for comparison, and usually I could see no difference between 2D and 3D.  So I felt like I wasted the extra bucks to see this in 3D rather 2D.  Sadly, this is a pretty common problem in today's 3D era.
1594135851|3.0|\\"Catching fire\\" is a light fluff quick read, easy read and entertaining enough.<br /><br />It wasn't bad, the problem is that it was just disappointing following the first book, basically because it's a repeat of \\"The hunger games\\".  It is a padding stepping stones to the final book.<br /><br />However I am SOOOOOOOOOOOO bored with the love triangle that seem to feature in every book aimed at this audience. Plus it is this 'triangle' is badly written. The 'innocent' girl caught between 2 gorgeous guys who love and adore her and would do anything for her. In the meanwhile she keeps them on the hook ever so 'innocently'...  In the first book she's not in love with Gale, he's a friend but now she loves him even though he barely features in the book.  Then we're supposed to believe that she's falling for Peeta too and that he loves this selfish, whiny girl who would kill him in a second if it ever suited her needs - she admits as much herself pretty much.  It's gross behaviour to promote as normal to string people along and she deservers neither.<br /><br />This review sounds more negative than I intended.  It was entertaining and I liked it enough to plan to read the next one but it's not the masterpiece that many reviews make it out to be.  Possibly because I'm not a young teenager...
B0086700CM|5.0|wow what an amazing game I have it on my phone and now it is on my kindle fire it so much better
B0086700CM|5.0|i love love love. love love love love love love this game so much. I play it every day. every one shuld play it. even baby's. !
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This story is lacking in so many ways and the writing is high school level at best. How did this make it on the bestsellers list? Very disappointing - the only good thing is I didn't purchase all 3 books.
0345803485|1.0|After hearing all the hype about this book, I bought the Trilogy.  Not even half way through the first book I was totally bored by the authors redundant use of phrases, ideas, scenes etc.  How many times can you read about a woman having an orgasm over and over and over and over again.  I believe the only reason this book made the best seller list was because teenagers buy it!  The writing is horendous, the plot - if there is one - is ridiculous.  Why I read all the books is beyond me.  Once I skipped all the sex scenes, Christian and Ana sitting at the bar eating, and the text messages, it took me a short time to finish.  Don't bother with this trilogy.  Read a real book!  By the way, I am an avid reader.
B0086700CM|5.0|wonderful game and a few glitches but this game is wonderful<br />b b b b b b b b b h b b b b b b
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I have to say this bag is fantastic and the price is unbeatable.  I was able to get my DSLR along with 4 lenses, my speedlight and all the accessories in this and still have some room to spare.  The pack is compact and is comfortable.  The only somewhat \\"tacky\\" thing is that the zipper pulls have the amazon logo on them which stands out on the all black exterior.  But hey, I suppose nobody will suspect that you are carrying thousands of dollars worth of equipment around in it.<br /><br />If you don't feel like spending a small fortune, and want a comfortable pack that does the job, I would recommend this.  I'm super happy with it!
B0086700CM|5.0|this is an amazing game its a must have game its the game that will never fade out ever I mean ever
B004A8EI9M|3.0|C grade.<br /><br />Just OK basic cable show with a few too many unbelievable plot holes and cliched zombie situations. Good if you're bored and just want to plop down and turn off your brain, you know be a zombie.<br /><br />1. A police officer or any other intelligent person(SOME PO's are intelligent) would have the basic logic that if millions of former humans are now rabid killer zombies then DON'T go to where there WERE large amounts of people clustered together i.e. cities. That's obviously where most zombies will be. DUH! I can see the logic of staying NEAR cities for their large stocks of non perishable food and other items but to march into a city is just beyond the pale. Lazy contrived story writing, ugh!<br /><br />2. Cliched zombie survivor story. In almost every zombie story there are a group of survivors who are bullied by one or two angry males, almost always southern white males. Geez could these writers be any more typical than the countless entertainment workers I encounter here in Los Angeles. Believe me they are a tribe with their conformist PC ways and views that are easy to spot in mass market entertainment. Most of us don't even know that much and how much our views are shaped by these people. The clearest illustration is the current metro based Democratic party.<br /><br />3. Annoying product placement. Oh that Dodge Charger scene was so obnoxious, now if fuel was limited and you didn't want to get in a car crash no matter what you would not go tearing full speed anywhere, but they have to get more and more revenue from both the paying audience and commercials AND in show placement, ugh. Not to mention the silly CDC part, that too would be the last place to go because EVERYONE else would go there too.<br /><br />4. Annoying PC character balancing so everyone can relate! Plenty of feel good revenge scenes, black man leaving racist angry white man behind to be eaten, everyone is \\"god\\" fearing appropriate level of morality, PC kindness, abused wife does the final killing of violent husband turned zombie, etc. etc. The hospital for the elderly is protected by our friendly Latino gang, very silly and contrived. In an apocalypse survival situation none of this would happen, we'd go back to survival of the strongest period. You can barely walk through a dept. store without feeling the anger/alienation even now.<br /><br />5. Plot holes. How could a character chained up suddenly out of nowhere find a hacksaw? Why would he use it on his hand rather than on the handcuffs? This is just silly. The tanks in the show would have had blood/body parts all over them including all of the cars, etc. They were clean as new here. Almost everything is burned out, why weren't the zombies also burned dead with the flames? The writers do so much to just string along a story in so many situations.<br /><br />Now granted I am an engineer so I can see so much more wrong with the logic and realism than most but come on!<br /><br />Zombies would be easy to immobilize in reality with our mechanized technology and number of technically educated people. You don't need to waste bullets firing on something that is just crawling along like in one scene. Simply mounting saws on the sides of a moving vehicle would cut their legs off effectively killing them or using airplanes to drop acid to burn them up, if they die from starvation then it would only be a matter of time anyways if they only eat flesh. Just run them over with a truck or car or tank, etc etc.<br /><br /> Heck set the whole city on fire or herd them into an enclosed fire proof place to get rid of them, duh! Herding them into a slaughtering plant or other ambush point and putting a heated wire at the neck level or leg level would take care of it too, etc. etc etc. Contrived and idiotic writing is what you get with the majority of advertising based shows though.<br /><br />From what I'm reading Season 2 is not as good as season 1, wow I'll skip this series here and now.
B007MNV5WU|1.0|so i finaly BUY  this app and it will not download to my kindle fire even though it says (kindle fire addition at least customer servance tried to help.<br />and i had to type this to get it to send
B007HJ84ZK|5.0|This show is really great. I thought it was a historical medieval show when I first turned it on but I find it's much better than that. Kinda like animated series are great because the medium gives them unlimited possibilities but they can still utilize real world characterizations and stories as well. I have watched and re-watched this show and other great HBO/Premium cable shows as opposed to the disposable broadcast/basic cable shows so it's actually a lasting investment.<br /><br />You quickly care about most of the characters, even the bad ones, due to the great story telling that hasn't gotten dull even after 2 seasons. I like season 1 better than 2 because it is more clear cut with a clear climax and ties up more loose ends than 2 did. The locations are amazing and varied, my favorite being the Eyrie castle in the sky.<br /><br />The plot is more believable than the majority of \\"real\\" series on TV which have so many silly events and circumstances it's sickening(sons of anarchy, hell on wheels,etc.). This is not a soap opera like many other shows are as well. There is never any unnecessary emotional pandering or \\"music video\\" montages, annoying product placement, etc.<br /><br />The clever plots are wonderful to see and were clearly thought through beforehand by a thoughtful, intelligent writer and production team. A lot of this is why HBO/premium channel and other subscriber based, as opposed to advertiser based, shows are the best. I think they are even better than 99% of movies.<br /><br />Another great thing is that if you don't want to wait for the show you can read the great book series which I'm doing now. The books are of course much deeper and fill in a lot of the missing pieces at least for me. The show illustrates a version of the events and for me gives appropriate faces(if not all accurate to the books) to the characters as well as voices. I see the TV production and the books as one entity that gives you the full experience, especially since theauthor of the books is actively writing for the show but the books were done years before the show so they were not just some typical hollywood screenwriter trying to make a buck by writing what the studio bigwigs THINK/DEMAND is a salable product.<br />RECOMMENDED!
B007ZRZF8I|5.0|this game is awesome you just run and tap the screen to flip the gravity! if you liked fragger and istunt then you should definetly get the amazing the one and only GRAVITY GUY!!! :):)
B005K2YRVG|4.0|I like this protection envelope for my Kindle. It's super simple, just slide the Kindle in and it's well protected and padded.<br /><br />I might have bought a different item if I'd thought about the fact that there's no way to attach the Kindle to a USB cord while it's in the sleeve. Also--I have only used my Kindle at home so far so I can just keep the sleeve on the table by my chair. It's occurred to me that when I take it elsewhere to use it, I'd prefer to have a notebook format that holds the Kindle while I'm reading it so there's no problem with misplacing the sleeve.<br /><br />So, overall a very well-designed product, but keep the limitations in mind.
0345803485|1.0|I'm about the same age as Ana and I couldn't relate to her at all...<br />Quick summary, Ana is about to graduate and interviews the deliciously good looking Billionaire Christian who finds her attractive and all that great stuff. He tells her how she shouldn't be near him and ends up taking her virginity and ends up turning her into a sex slave... (well, I can see where it came from Twilight fanfiction)<br />I was curious since this story brought up S&M and I'm studying sociology and like to study the human mind like this, but it was... disappointing because I didn't learn anything and I felt as if this wasn't really what the lifestyle was like.<br />The sex scenes didn't make me \\"gasp\\" or shiver. Or make me blink. I kept wanting to laugh because of how bad the writing was and how unrealistic the characters were. I'm annoyed since I want to be a writer and what people think is good writing, or even what a good plot is.<br />Some reviewers complained about Ana (cough, Bella, cough) kept her virginity through college. It's not impossible, but unlikely since Ana didn't have any religious background or reasoning or say how, \\"I wanted to wait until I was in love\\" or at least some crap like that. She wasn't attracted to anyone before Christian? Really? Now, I know that's bull. And not drinking until your senior year of COLLEGE? Again, if she had some religious reason I would buy it or some other reason, but since we don't get that in this story, I'm either thinking Ana is very anti-social, anti-curious, or goes to a small school where it's easier to bust kids drinking. Even \\"dry\\" campuses aren't really \\"dry\\" (I should know, I go to one).<br />Here's what I've learned, do not read anything on the New York Time's best selling list again.
B003QSLW0K|4.0|Lilo is an adorable yet troubled child. She finds what she thinks is a pet in Stich. It turns out that Stitch is an alien, and a rather bizarre one at that. My kids who are 6 and 8, though, like the show. They like the crazy antics of Stitch and the other aliens. And from a parental point of view, and a parent of a girl, it is fantastic to see animated women who are not paler than pale and skinnier than sticks.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I like that it has hour by hour temps and rain updates. that is all. thank you. good stuff indeed
B0072IVGZG|5.0|I thought the CD was great when I first heard it and then I listened to it loudly over a Saturday while working on the house, and it grew on me even more....then I caught them live again last night and the new songs sound as good if not better than the older material.  Buy this CD.  You won't be disappointed.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|I received this backpack as part of a free bundle with a D7000 camera purchase, so can't complain. This item seems to be made well and has plenty of space for camera,lenses and any accessories etc.<br />My only gripe is after paying so much on a camera, the bag zipper tags have amazon Basics written on them.I might sound petty but i just don't like this,even though it was free!
B00729GQ0A|5.0|First, I'd like to say I've been overlooking tweets about this book for a while. The title drew me in and hell, I'm crazy about the cover, but the only thing keeping me away from reading it was the fact I was so busy. Finally, things have been slowing down and I had time to read the book. I won't use one word to describe it because, simply, this book needs proper praise!<br /><br />I'm a big fan of old literature and what kept me reading was because the feel and pace of this novel reminded me of The Scarlet Letter mixed with the ridicule and anguish of The Salem Witch Trials. It amazes me that such a contemporary author has the ability to unlock old school prose lol.<br /><br />This occult series will not disappoint. If you're into young women finding themselves magically, through forbidden love and betrayal (think Charmed), then this is probably a novel for you to share with your friends!
B005LAIHSG|4.0|From my wife Sarah: I see many negative reviews here, but we really liked this movie. Here's why:<br /><br />- It was simply very entertaining. It had several subtle changes to the Snow White story so that the movie kept us wondering what would happen next. The characters were much more complex than the fairy story, so much more interesting to watch. There was some action mixed with fantasy that made it exciting.<br /><br />- Actress Charlize Theron was absolutely amazing and her character was well scripted. She brought this movie up to a whole other level. She gave amazing depth to the character of the evil witch, and made her much more than a fairy tale figure.<br /><br />- It had a positive message ultimately.<br /><br />This is definitely worth seeing for adults, and I'd probably watch it again. However this is NOT for kids. The story is rather dark, and although not bloody, there's some intense violence and some nudity.

B00701QVVY|5.0|Ironbound was the best album since Killbox 13, in my opinion. But this album is a HUGE thing!<br /><br />About the sound? Totally wrecking! About the limited edition(with DVD bonus)? AWESOME! The quality of pictures and the production in general are unbelievable! I strongly reccomend that you buy the limited edition, that worths! link for limited edition is bellow:<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/Electric-Age-Overkill/dp/B0070W75RW/ref=sr_1_sc_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1339183054&sr=8-1-spell

B003TQKVGU|1.0|I bought this work because of the reviews, and I am baffled that so many thought so highly of it. To me, it fails to provide anything more than a call to prayer, which I find anachronistic at best and offensive to a thoughtful person.
0380973839|4.0|This is a book I have in my must read book, but... The day of the author's death I could have bought it for $5.00. As much as I like this subject, I refuse to aid In the commercialization of the author's death, so soon.  These are the same books available on the day before his death, not specially edited to aid in the understanding of his personality, writings or life, so I will wait until the fever for  \\"Martians\\"  is gone or I will accept my fate and never read these wonderful stories. Not until they sell at the previous price. Sometimes I hate the human condition. I have read Asimov in my teens and on my 20's and 30's . Probably many of Bradbury. I will wait.I will wait as tempting as it is. I should have bought at $5.00 but was waiting to bundle with other items. No more.
B001RIY4WE|4.0|I have viewed all four Terminator movies.  I consider the first to be a great \\"B\\" rate movie.  The third movie was a bad \\"B\\" movie and the fourth was more of a poorly made Matrix sequel than a Terminator film.  T2 is by far the best Terminator movie and the best movie Arnold has ever been in.  The skynet edition Blu Ray includes the extended director's cut which explains more clearly how Arnold's character comes to appreciate the value of human life.  It also does a better job of portraying  John Connor as a future leader in a scene where he prevents his mother from destroying the terminator sent to protect them.  The picture is clear as a day and the sound is great.  My only complaint is that the Blu Ray takes forever to load because it connects to the internet every time it is inserted in order to load additional bonus content.

B007N85ZXY|1.0|\\"God Save the Queen\\" never EVER was, and never will be America's national anthem or song.  Someone is trying to sell this album in Britain in the year of the 60th Jubilee: don't ever call that title \\"Americana\\".  How \\"Get a Job\\" gets on the same album as \\"Oh Susanna\\" can only be in the twisted imagination of some foreigner like Young.  Better to have put \\"Sweet Home Alabama\\" on there by a mile, but that wouldn't be a fit either.<br /><br />If one likes some hostile foreigner like Neil Young to piss on your country, this is the album for you.  No self-respecting citizen would have anything to do with it.
0061992860|4.0|I have a Military Back ground. I bought the book to carry with me back packing. It is a perfect size for that. Great guide.
B005LAIGZU|3.0|Let me start by saying I respect noone more than Navy Seals. That being said, there were a lot of laughable moments in the movie when I really felt like I was watching someone play Call of Duty Black Ops, especially when it went to first person camera view of shooting.<br />And I have to say the acting was really distracting.If this were a reenactment I'd let it pass, but this is supposed to be a movie where the actors make you believe they are who they are playing (ironic here, since they really ARE who they are playing!).<br />The story was a little weak and predictable. I thought about Hot Shots as the characters were introduced. Oh, here's the guy with the baby on the way: he's a gonner! Here's the really bad guy: bet he dies really violently! But I'll let these things pass because it all came together well.<br />I loved the action in this movie, the cinematography and seeing all the special ops in detail. Just wish the writers could have made me care for these REAL HEROES as much as I cared for Goose when he died in Top Gun.
